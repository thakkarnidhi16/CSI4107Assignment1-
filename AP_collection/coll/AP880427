<TEXT>
   The Iran-Contra trial judge accused the Reagan
administration Wednesday of intentionally holding back classified
documents needed by the defense, and warned that charges would be
dismissed if the stonewalling continues.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell blamed the dilemma not on
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh but on an inter-departmental
task force that has control over hundreds of thousands of secret
documents that may be needed in the case.
   ``A stone wall is being built up between this court and the
trial,'' Gesell said at the end of a day-long pre-trial hearing.
   Noting that Walsh has tried to get the documents for the
defense, the judge said: ``The responsibility lies with the
attorney general and the White House. I want to find out promptly
what is taking place and what is going to take place.''
   Gesell said the case has encountered a serious obstacle because
of the administration's ``intentional withholding of documents
necessary for the defense.''
   He also has said the case cannot go to trial unless the
administration declassifies relevant documents that may be
introduced into evidence.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said, ``There is
certainly no attempt being made to impede the process in any way....
   ``We're talking about a large volume of material here that needs
careful examination. The task force, with Justice Department
involvement, is working as fast as they can to process the
documents,'' he said.
   Korten noted that the task force is ``not something totally
within Justice Department control. It's something that involves a
number of different agencies'' including the White House, the State
Department, the Defense Department and the CIA. ``It is not a
process that works quickly.''
   Gesell said, ``We cannot satisfy the maximum desires of the
inter-departmental committee'' and added he was not interested in
trying to summarize ``contents of masses of documents.''
   ``We are not going to sit around in court, in a series of secret
hearings, and rewrite the documents and get them ready for trial.
That is not (the way to conduct) a trial in this country,'' he said.
   The question of the classified documents _ to be discussed at a
hearing Thursday _ and defense accusations of improper
evidence-gathering by the prosecution dim chances of an early trial
date, although Gesell did not address the date directly.
   He said there would be hearings on those two matters through
May. Gesell originally sought a July trial date, while the defense
has said it will not be ready until next March. Walsh said he is
ready to go to trial in July.
   Gesell said he was gravely concerned about the classified
documents, sternly warning prosecutors ``the case will have to be
dismissed'' if the records are not turned over to defendants Oliver
L. North, John M. Poindexter, Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord.
   Walsh said 24,597 classified government documents are now
available for review by the defense team, only slightly more than
the 24,000 pages that Walsh said were ready two weeks ago.
   Gesell has ordered Walsh to make up to 300,000 pages of
classified documents available to the defendants.
   The judge said, ``I was extremely disturbed by the
implications'' of a motion filed Tuesday by Hakim, who complained
that Walsh was trying to limit his access to the most sensitive
documents gathered in the investigation.
   At a previous hearing, Gesell said all defendants and their
lawyers must have access to the records, including Hakim _ a
businessman who never has been granted a security clearance.
   The other three defendants have had long military careers _
North in the Marine Corps, Poindexter in the Navy and Secord in the
Air Force _ during which they frequently handled classified
materials.
   Gesell said he wants to ``break what appears to be a very
serious logjam'' over the records.
   The defendants are charged with conspiring to defraud the United
States by illegally diverting money from secret U.S. arms sales to
Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was
banned by law.
   The 23-count indictment also accuses North, Hakim and Secord of
improperly benefiting financially from the arms sales profits,
which it says belonged to the United States.
   North is the former National Security Council staffer who
directed the Iran and Contra assistance operations; Poindexter, who
approved North's activities, was President Reagan's national
security adviser; and Secord and Hakim were businessmen recruited
by North to handle logistics and finances in both operations.
   The problem of prosecution evidence-gathering results from
congressional grants of limited immunity for North, Hakim and
Poindexter when they testified before Congress on the Iran-Contra
affair last summer. Secord testified without immunity.
   Immunity grants bar Walsh from using testimony of the three
defendants in prosecution against them, except in cases of perjury.
The defense has accused Walsh and his assistant prosecutors of
using just such evidence, with North attorney Brendan V. Sullivan
Jr. saying the prosecutor's procedures to avoid ``taint'' were
``laughable on their face.''
   Gesell ordered this week's limited hearing on the immunity
question to determine if he would need a much longer pre-trial
session on the subject. He decided Wednesday that the expanded
hearing would be necessary before trial.
   ``We're a long way from any resolution'' of the question, Gesell
said. ``I want the benefit of a full argument on both sides. It
ought to be clear there is a ... problem.'' He acknowledged that
the difficulty was caused by Congress' decision to grant the
immunity.
   As he did in a hearing on Monday, Walsh took the witness stand
Wednesday to describe the precautions he and his staff took to
avoid exposure to testimony given under immunity.
   Walsh testified that Judith Hetherton, an associate counsel on
his staff, had to cut off a Justice Department official who had
started to convey to her testimony from North to the House-Senate
Iran-Contra committee last summer.
   ``She had to really be forceful with him to get him to stop,''
he testified.
   The Washington Post quoted a Justice Department spokesman as
saying that the official was Assistant Attorney General William
Bradford Reynolds but that his remark to Ms. Hetherton was only a
brief inadvertent reference to a segment of North's testimony.
   Hetherton was one of the prosecutors who questioned Reynolds
when he appeared before a grand jury earlier this year for
questioning about his role in the November 1986 investigation of
the Iran-Contra affair.
   In addition to general instructions to his staff, the
independent counsel said he took extraordinary steps at times _
even ordering staffers to take a two-week vacation after Poindexter
began to testify. Walsh did the same.
   Even so, he said, there was the day he turned on the lights in
his hotel room to sign for breakfast, and accidentally saw a banner
headline in the newspaper on Poindexter's testimony.
   Another time, Walsh testified, his daughter called him after
North's testimony to say ``she didn't realize how difficult'' his
job was. ``I learned there was enough of an impact (from the
congressional testimony) to have her call,'' he said.
   And Gesell indicated that it was impossible for anyone to avoid
the impact of the case, pointing out that he saw a ``North For
President'' sticker on the way to his Virginia farm.

   Israeli analysts trace the reconciliation of
Yasser Arafat and President Hafez Assad of Syria to Assad's desire
for more influence in Israeli-occupied lands and the PLO chief's
need for Syrian help in Lebanon.
   If the Arab rivals settle their differences the results would be
more violence against Israel, isolation of Jordan and the end of
the U.S. peace plan for the Middle East, already criticized by both
Israelis and Arabs, the analysts predicted.
   One said he did not expect the reconciliation to last because
distrust between Arafat and Assad ``is so profound.''
   The two met on Monday in Damascus, capital of Syria. Syrian and
Palestinian sources said they discussed the U.S. peace plan and the
Arab rebellion that began nearly five months ago in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   It was Arafat's first visit to Damascus since Syria expelled him
June 24, 1983, during a mutiny against his leadership by PLO
factions backed by Assad.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel's response to the
meeting would be to heighten its alert along its borders and in the
West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
   Since the rebellion in the territories began Dec. 8,
Palestinians have tried 11 times to enter Israel from Lebanon. In
the latest attempt Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers and three
guerrillas were killed.
   ``Whenever you have an Arab consensus, it will always be
directed against the security of Israel,'' Shamir said on Israel
radio. ``Therefore, we have to be vigilant.''
   According to the analysts, the reconciliation effort was
prompted by Assad's desire for more influence in the occupied
territories, where most Palestinians support the Palestine
Liberation Organization, and by Arafat's need for free movement for
his fighters in Lebanon.
   Syria has 25,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the main power
broker in a nation factionalized by 13 years of civil war.
   A significant element in Arafat's decision was the weakening of
his mainstream Fatah movement by the assassination April 16 of his
deputy Khalil Wazir, better known as Abu Jihad, military analyst
Zeev Schiff said in an interview.
   Wazir, who was buried in Damascus last week, was popular with
both Arafat loyalists and pro-Syrian PLO dissidents.
   Israeli sources have said Israeli commandos killed Wazir, but
the government has not acknowledged it.
   ``The Abu Jihad killing hurt Arafat's supporters and may have
been an impetus for this meeting,'' said Schiff, a correspondent
for the daily Haaretz. ``Arafat wants to appear more radical. This
meeting shows the PLO leader is like a pendulum, moving from one
position to another.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said either Syria or the PLO must
compromise if an alliance was to be achieved and Assad would not
moderate his position.
   Instead, ``the Syrians will demand from him (Arafat) extreme
positions that will pull him away from Jordan, from Egypt,'' Rabin
predicted on Israel television.
   Yossi Olmert, a Middle East specialist at Tel Aviv University,
said a PLO-Syrian alliance probably would isolate King Hussein of
Jordan because he is more moderate than Assad and willing to
discuss solutions to the Middle East conflict.
   Olmert said the meeting also was bad news for the United States.
   ``This is the last nail in the coffin of the U.S. peace
proposal,'' he said. ``It's yet another insurmountable difficulty
for Secretary of State (George P.) Shultz, at least at this
juncture.''
   In predicting the Arafat-Assad alliance would collapse, he said:
``The PLO and Syria ... both want to keep pressure on Israel from
the territories and from Lebanon, and they both are not eager to
make concessions for peace.
   ``But even though we see them kissing now, at the end of the day
Syrian suspicion of the PLO and PLO distrust of Syria is so
profound that I can't see how it can last.''
   He and others predicted the short-term impact of the
Arafat-Assad meeting would be negative.
   ``The `Sulha in Damascus' will fuel further unrest in the
territories,'' correspondent Uzi Machnaimi wrote in the daily
Yediot Ahronot, using the Arabic word for a reconciliation meeting.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands applauded the meeting.
   ``We Palestinians have been waiting for this moment,'' said
Elias Freij, a Palestinian Christian who favors Jordan and is mayor
of Bethlehem.
   Former Mayor Bassam Shakaa of Nablus said: ``The PLO-Syrian
reconciliation will double the power of the uprising. The fighting
spirit of the Palestinians will soar.''

   Evangelist Billy Graham is hardly a household
name in this officially atheist nation, where spreading the gospel
to non-believers is against the law.
   But his whirlwind tour has left behind some unlikely images.
When the Southern Baptist met with Premier Li Peng, he urged the
leader of the world's largest communist nation to study the life of
Jesus Christ.
   When he toured the Great Wall, he led a group of schoolchildren
in a chorus of ``Jesus Loves the Little Children.''
   Although the visit has received little publicity in the national
media, Chinese Christian leaders say it shows that the current
official attitude toward religion is the most relaxed its been
since the Communist takeover in 1949.
   ``It shows that out state leaders recognize the great influence
of religious leaders in other countries,'' said Shen Yifen, pastor
of Shanghai's Community Church and vice president of the
state-appointed China Christian Council, which is in charge of all
Protestant churches.
   ``I think his visit will help more people understand
Christianity, and also the place of Christianity in any society,''
he said.
   Christians form a tiny minority among China's more than 1
billion people. The official Protestant church has an estimated 4
million members, as does the official Catholic church, which does
not recognize Vatican authority.
   The 69-year-old Graham, who concludes his 16-day visit on
Thursday, is regarded as a leading figure in the Protestant church
and has preached in nearly 70 countries. But his name is unknown to
most Chinese.
   Many Chinese, however, are curious about Christianity and its
influence on politics in the West, even if they have no religious
beliefs themselves.
   At a news conference in Shanghai on Monday, 15 Chinese reporters
peppered Graham with questions for nearly an hour on such topics as
the role of religion in world affairs.
   Graham has said repeatedly during his visit that he senses a
desire for spiritual renewal in China.
   ``In talking with leaders about religion and freedom and human
rights, I have found a very warm and favorable response,'' Graham
told the news conference.
   ``Some leaders brought the subject up themselves. Each one I
think without exception said, `We recognize the problems. We are
trying to do something about them.'''
   During the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution, all
religious activity was banned in China and places of worship were
destroyed or turned into factories, warehouses and schools.
   In recent years, some churches have reopened and controls have
relaxed, but religion still is subject to close state supervision.
Any efforts to convert non-believers outside of church are banned.
   Graham refused after his meeting with Li to say whether they
discussed the continued imprisonment of Christians for their
religious activities. Several Roman Catholic priests have been
jailed for years for refusing to renounce loyalty to the pope.
   Asked in Shanghai why he wasn't raising such hard issues,
Graham's only response was, ``Who says I didn't?''
   He has not commented in public on the reported arrest of a
Christian preacher who had come to Beijing to hear Graham speak.
The preacher, Xu Yongzhe, escaped several years ago from a
detention center where he had been held for spreading the gospel,
according to the Chinese Church Research Center in Hong Kong.
   The center has links to Protestants in China who worship in
unofficial ``house churches'' rather than the official church.
   Members of Graham's group were enthusiastic about the impact of
his visit, one calling it a ``very important breakthrough'' for
China.
   Carol Lee Hamrin, a Chinese affairs specialist who accompanied
Graham, said the visit led to ``a lot of consciousness-raising''
among officials who met with Graham and would not otherwise have
thought about religion.
   Graham himself said only that he hoped to build ``bridges of
understanding between China and the United States.''
   Another, more modest goal, that he fulfilled was to visit the
birthplace of his wife, Ruth, who accompanied him on the trip along
with their eldest son, Franklin.
   Mrs. Graham, the daughter of a missionary surgeon, was born in
eastern China's Jiangsu province and lived there until age 17. The
town was the Graham's first stop after leaving Beijing.

   The stunning performance of extreme rightist
Jean-Marie Le Pen in the presidential election's first round
indicates a major split among French conservatives that could put
them in the minority for years.
   The National Front leader surpassed all predictions Sunday,
winning 14.4 percent of the vote. He nearly matched the 16.5
percent gained by former center-right Premier Raymond Barre and was
not far behind conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, who had 19.5
percent.
   Sunday's winner, with 34.1 percent of the vote, was President
Francois Mitterrand, a 71-year-old Socialist who built a moderate
image in the waning years of his first seven-year term. Chirac, 55,
will face him in a runoff May 8, and attracting Le Pen's supporters
appears to be the premier's only chance.
   ``The right, which is in the majority today in France, risks
being in the minority in two weeks,'' said Pascal Perinot of the
Center for French Political Studies. ``Chirac is caught between two
blocs demanding different things.''
   Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic party is allied
with the center-right Union for French Democracy, which backed
Barre in the first round, but the alliance is not always an easy
one.
   Some of Barre's centrist backers are expected to cross over to
Mitterrand, and that seepage could become a flood if Chirac makes
overtures to Le Pen, 59, who has emerged as a major force after 20
years on the margin of French politics.
   His goals, repeated often and eloquently, are to rid France of
Third World immigrants, save jobs and welfare benefits for the
French and crack down on crime, which he also blames on immigrants.
   Chirac has pledged not to make a deal with Le Pen for support,
leaving him with the problem of how to lure National Front voters
without their leader.
   Whatever Chirac does, the traditional conservative parties risk
the same political trap in which the left was caught during much of
the past three decades.
   For years the Socialists had the Communist Party, representing
20 percent to 25 percent of the vote in the 1960s and 1970s,
looming over their shoulders and frightening moderate voters. Only
with the decline of the Communists in the 1980s did the Socialists
come to the fore.
   That same phenomenon could be facing the right.
   ``For a quarter of a century, the left was kept out of power
because of the power of the Communist Party,'' political analyist
Alain Duhamel wrote in a commentary. ``If the present parliamentary
majority doesn't watch out, the existence of an influenctial
National Front could constitute a similar handicap.''
   Simone Veil, a leading centrist politican and former president
of the European Parliament, said: ``If Jacques Chirac's language
borrows the themes of the National Front, he will lose much more
from the center than he will gain from Jean-Marie Le Pen's voters.''
   She said her vote would be one of those lost to Chirac in such a
case.
   Pierre Mehaignerie, another centrist leader, said: ``Jacques
Chirac has two weeks to answer and give these (centrist) voters the
assurances they are seeking.''
   Mitterrand, who was visiting the French Antilles, was quick to
grasp the National Front stick and thrash Chirac with it.
   ``I would not like to see the formation of an anomalous
coaltion,'' the incumbent declared.
   ``I hope that no responsible candidate will allow himself to go
so far as to discuss with, deal with or foresee a future government
with a political movement which, with regard to racism, shows so
much indulgence. It is on this kind of political act that one will
judge real intentions and that one will judge on May 8.''
   Perinot said the traditional right ``will no longer be credible
among voters'' unless it ends internal quarrels and finds a way to
weaken the National Front
   ``Chirac must pick up a part of this electorate, but he will not
get it all because in this election there was a large amount of
protest, of hostility toward the political class,'' Perinot said.
``The extreme right vote was an anti-political demonstration.''
   National Front voters tend to be young and male, largely from
the class of shopkeepers, artisans and small businessmen. A similar
movement led by Pierre Poujade succeeded in electing 53 deputies to
the National Assembly in 1956, among them Le Pen, but faded in the
next election.
   Although the National Front appeals to many of the same voters,
it also attracts the working class, which makes up about 20 percent
of its support.
   ``In the 1950s and 1960s, the French never gave a durable vote
to the extreme right because of the Vichy experience,'' said
Perinot, referring to the wartime government that collaborated with
the Nazis. ``Now, most of the young have forgotten history and the
extreme right has emerged.''

   LeVar Burton and Louis Gossett Jr. will
recreate their roles as Kunta Kinte and Fiddler in a television
movie, ``Roots Christmas,'' 12 years after work started on the
original ``Roots'' production.
   The ABC movie was scheduled to go into production here today.
   Production started on ``Roots,'' Alex Haley's epic of a black
family's journey from Africa to slavery to freedom, on April 28,
1976, in Savannah, Ga.
   ``Roots Christmas'' dramatizes ``the inherent lust for freedom
that motivated early mass escapes of slaves, which paved the way
for the ... Underground Railroad,'' Haley said at a news conference
Tuesday at Burbank Studios.
   The setting for the tale is Christmas 1770. The Underground
Railroad was a system of safe houses set up by abolitionists to
move slaves to freedom in the years before the Civil War.
   ``In the course of researching `Roots,' there was such a breadth
of things that I could only select some of them for the book,''
Haley said. ``One of the things that intrigued me was the sporadic,
undisciplined efforts of the slaves to run away. I had been reading
about the Underground Railroad and felt this would work well with a
Christmas setting.''
   Haley noted that such first generation slaves as Kunta Kinte
were usually Moslem and strongly held on to their religious beliefs
even though they were surrounded by Christians. He said Kunta
Kinte, who came to be called Toby, married a Christian woman Belle,
and that Fiddler also was a Christian influence on him.
   The movie, which will be filmed in Los Angeles and Nashville,
Tenn., also stars Michael Learned; Shaun Cassidy; Avery Brooks;
Jerry Hardin as the plantation owner; and Kate Mulgrew as Hattie
Carraway, a female slave catcher whose character is based on a real
person, said Haley.
   Kevin Hooks will direct the movie from David Eyre's screenplay.
   Executive producer David Wolper said the two-hour movie will be
filmed in 18 days at a cost of $4 million. The cost for all 12
hours of ``Roots'' was $6.5 million.
   Gossett said Kunta Kinte and Fiddler have entered American
folklore. ``They are important characters and I feel it's a
comfortable cloak for me to wear. I think it's very important to do
a story like this for Christmas, when this country needs healing of
all sorts.''
   Haley said he would be leaving soon on a series of freighter
voyages to write a book about Madam C.J. Walker, a poor black woman
who became the first black millionaire and helped spark the
so-called ``Harlem Renaissance.''
   Haley, a former Coast Guardsman, does all his writing on long
ocean voyages aboard rented cabins on freighters.
   ``Roots,'' which ran for eight nights in January 1977 is still
ranked as one of the most watched dramatic presentations in
television history. More than 100 million people watched the final
night.
   The sequel, ``Roots: The Next Generation,'' was broadcast over
seven nights in February 1979 and also received high ratings.

<HEAD>US Demands Right To Increase Nitrogen Oxide Emissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. diplomats negotiating in Geneva on an
international pollution agreement demanded a right for the United
States to emit 20 percent more of a key ingredient of acid rain
than it produced last year, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.
   ``We started controlling emissions long before the Europeans
thought about it,'' Sheldon Meyers, the Environmental Protection
Agency's acting associate administrator for international
activities, told the newspaper.
   ``We have a program in place that has affected the lives of most
U.S. citizens and we feel like we should get credit for it,''
Meyers said.
   A high-ranking Canadian official who was not identified by the
Post said U.S. diplomats told Canadian officials Tuesday that they
would not accept an alternative proposal offered by Canada earlier
this month.
   Under that compromise proposal, Canada agreed to a provision
that would have resulted in smaller increases in U.S. discharges of
nitrogen oxides as long as they did not result in increases of the
pollutant moving into Canada, the paper reported.
   Instead, the U.S. diplomats said they would press a demand for
provisions that would increase nitrogen oxide emissions by 4
million tons annually, the Post quoted the Canadian official as
saying.
   ``It was a total rejection,'' the Canadian was quoted as saying.
``We were hoping for some progress and there's no progress at all.
The main problem is it could result in a significant increase'' in
the flow of nitrogen oxides across the border into Canada.
   The United States, Canada, the Soviet Union and Western and
Eastern European nations have been negotiating since 1983 to try to
solve air pollution problems that cross national borders.
   The United States has insisted that it should get credit for the
steps it took before other countries got involved in air pollution
control, such as controls on auto tailpipes and smokestack
emissions that have resulted in a 14 percent reduction in nitrogen
oxide pollution in the past 10 years.
   The new U.S. position came on the eve of a visit to Washington
by Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   The two countries, in addition to participating in the
international negotiations, have been working on a bilateral
agreement on ways to reduce acid rain emissions. A senior
administration official predicted Tuesday that the two countries
will not reach agreement on that before the Reagan administration
leaves office.

<HEAD>Agency Tries To Save Towns' Rural Charm With Manual On Development</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An agency trying to preserve the character
of Massachusetts' rural towns has published a guide on how those
municipalities can retain their charm.
   The 183-page manual, titled ``Dealing with Change in the
Connecticut River Valley,'' was unveiled Tuesday by the Center for
Rural Massachusetts and is designed to help selectmen and planners
corral development that can destroy the very characteristics that
make rural areas desirable.
   Anthony Yaro, the center's director and an author of the manual,
pointed to Connecticut as an example of what not to do. ``That
whole state is close to turning into one large commuter suburb,''
he said.
   The Legislature created the Center for Rural Massachusetts in
1985 when lawmakers became aware of farmland's vulnerability to
development.
   The center is based at the College of Food and Natural Resources
at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, which has developed
guidelines for rural landscape protection.
   Some of those guidelines defy conventional wisdom, which
dictates that new homes must be built on big lots.
   The booklet recommends that houses and businesses sit in
clusters well back from the road and the land between the buildings
and the road be filled with native trees and wildflowers rather
than the junipers and bark mulch ``ubiquitious in suburbia.''
   ``It is ironic that the traditionally tightly knit village
pattern so typical of rural New Engand is illegal to reproduce or
emulate in many, if not most, rural Massachusetts communities
today,'' the manual said.
   Randall G. Arendt, the center's associate director, said he was
appalled to see the haphazard way development has sprung up in New
England towns and cities after spending seven years studying in
England, where growth is strictly limited to tasteful clusters of
homes in villages, leaving precious farmland untouched.
   ``Planning here is almost a futile exercise,'' he said.
   He said roads with businesses lining both sides are becoming
commonplace in western Massachusetts. He compared them to
``hardening of the arteries: These are strips of commercial ribbons
that don't allow traffic to move swiftly and safely.''
   But he blamed zoning laws, not businesses, for the clogged roads.

   Former City Controller Joseph Vignola won
Pennsylvania's Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate on Tuesday,
setting up a David vs. Goliath contest with Republican incumbent
John Heinz in the fall.
   With 73 percent of the vote counted, Vignola had 398,751, or 51
percent, to 252,378, or 31 percent, for former Potter County
Commissioner Susan Sullivan Kefover, who ran a surprisingly strong
second.
   Villanova University Professor John Logue and LaRouche Democrat
Steven Douglas were trailing far behind, Douglas with 97,539 votes
and Logue 53,968.
   Vignola was backed by Gov. Robert P. Casey, Philadelphia Mayor
W. Wilson Goode and the Democratic State Committee.
   Former Potter County Commissioner Susan Sullivan Kefover,
Villanova University Professor John Logue and LaRouche Democrat
Steven Douglas also sought the nomination.
   Heinz said he would run very hard on his record and his agenda.
   ``Our job in Pennsylvania is to move ahead without leaving
anyone behind,'' Heinz said in a television interview.
   Asked about the task of taking on the wealthy incumbent in the
fall, Vignola replied: ``If I were making ketchup, perhaps it would
be difficult. I'm not making ketchup. I'm running against a
lackluster U.S. senator.''

   Pennsylvania Democrats have not elected one of their own to the
U.S. Senate since Joseph Clark narrowly gained a second term in
1962.
   Heinz, who faced no opposition in the primary, refused to be
drawn into any exchange with Vignola, who contended Heinz has lost
touch with his constituency.
   ``Ask me after the primary,'' Heinz said when asked if he would
debate Vignola.
   Vignola, 38, a lawyer, called on Heinz to limit campaign
spending to $2 million.
   Heinz, 49-year-old heir to the H.J. Heinz food empire, is one of
the Senate's wealthiest members and has raised more than $5 million
in his previous two Senate campaigns.
   Heinz has about $2 million in his campaign fund for November,
while Vignola has raised about $200,000.
   Vignola has cited his Philadelphia rowhouse roots, saying
``Pennsylvania needs a senator to represent the people on Main
Street ... not Wall Street,''
   He has said he would focus on Heinz's voting record for aid to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, the space-based missile-defense
system and the MX missile, and his opposition to cost-of-living
increases in Social Security.
   ``I am carrying the Democratic agenda,'' he said. ``An agenda
which educates our children, puts our people back to work, cares
for our senior citizens, provides a viable defense for our nation
and uses every day to build for a better tomorrow.''
   Heinz spokesman Richard Bryers said during the campaign that it
was unfair to portray the senator as a Republican fat cat who
ignores his constituency.
   The senator's ``basic approach is that the way you get
re-elected is to do your job for the people,'' Bryers said. ``He's
got an agenda for Pennsylvania. The senator is reaching out to
broaden the base of his support with the working people.''

   A journalist was fined $750 after
refusing to identify the person who reportedly gave him a love
letter that a waitress sent to a married police officer assigned to
guard Queen Elizabeth II.
   The Sun, a London tabloid that employed the defendant James
Lawson as a free-lance reporter, published the letter under the
headline: ``Royal Copper Ditches Wife for Bargirl.''
   Before being fined for contempt of court on Tuesday, Lawson told
the presiding magistrate: ``I don't want to prejudice my source.''
   Lawson was a witness at Stonehaven Sheriff Court in Scotland
when Stanley Jaffray pleaded innocent to stealing the letter last
November.
   Prosecutor James Mackay said the waitress met the officer when
he was a guard at Balmoral Castle, the queen's summer residence in
Scotland, and they exchanged letters after he returned to Windsor
Castle near London.
   Jaffray was freed for lack of evidence on the basis of testimony
that he found the letter outside a post office.

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Won't Call for Withdrawal of Accutane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful drug that can cure severe acne but
can harm unborn children should remain on the market, but with
additional warnings and new packaging to discourage use by pregnant
women, a government panel says.
   Since its introduction in 1982, the drug Accutane has carried
specific and explicit warnings that there is a high risk it will
cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy.
   Those warnings have been strengthened in intervening years, but
Food and Drug Administration officials are concerned too many women
_ and perhaps their doctors _ are ignoring them.
   Against that backdrop, an advisory panel convened by the FDA on
Tuesday concluded that the medication _ the only one that cures the
severe, scarring type of acne it is intended to treat _ is too
valuable to deny to thousands of patients solely to provide added
protection to those who would abuse it.
   Moreover, panel members noted that the drug, marketed by Roche
Laboratories of New Jersey, also is available in 40 other countries
and probably would find its way onto a U.S. black market if made
illegal.
   After concluding unanimously that the benefit of the drug
outweighed the risk of its misuse, the panel recommended a number
of steps to strengthen the warnings to doctors and patients against
its use by women who are pregnant or at risk of becoming pregnant.
   One of those recommendations embraced a proposal by Roche to
sell Accutane only in a so-called blister package in which explicit
patient warnings _ including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a
red X drawn through it _ would be sealed at the factory to make
sure the patient would see them.
   The panel also recommended that the FDA try to find a legal way
to partially restrict distribution, perhaps by saying only
dermatologists could prescribe it and that two doctors would have
to agree that the patient needed the drug and would not become
pregnant during the four to five months the drug is typically taken.
   Although the agency frequently follows the advice of the 26
advisory panels it maintains to review new drug applications and
monitor existing drug use, those recommendations are not binding.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young told the panel the agency has not
found legal justification in the past for partial restriction of
any drug approved for sale, but he promised to ask lawyers to
restudy the question.
   ``It may be that when we revisit this we will get a different
opinion,'' Young said.
   However, he acknowledged later at a news conference that an FDA
attempt to implement distribution and prescribing restrictions
probably would be tied up in court for years by legal challenges
from physicians.
   Court opinions over the years have reinforced the FDA's
traditional position that it has little legal authority over how
doctors prescribe a drug once it is approved for sale.
   Under federal law, regulation of the practice of medicine is
left exclusively to the states and the longstanding legal
interpretation is that prescribing drugs is part of the practice of
medicine.
   The daylong meeting of the FDA's dermatologic drugs advisory
committee was convened to recommend ways to avoid misuse of
Accutane.
   The FDA has received reports of 66 birth defects associated with
the drug since 1982.
   Forty-five of the defects were in the first two years of the
drug's use when warnings were less severe. There have been 21
reports since 1985, when labeling cautions were strengthened.
   Several members of the advisory committee said they had no doubt
the problem of misuse leading to birth defects was greater than
reported to the FDA.
   However, they questioned the validity of a projection based on a
study of Medicare patients in Michigan, which concluded that there
may have been as many as 1,300 instances of birth defects related
to the drug nationwide.
   Those projections were based on a series of statistical
projections based on just three actual cases of Accutane-related
birth defects among Michigan Medicaid recipients over a three-year
period.

   A federal court ordered an investigation
into alleged human rights abuses at a secretive German colony in
southern Chile after the West German government requested the probe.
   ``The accusations are serious, and we naturally want those who
are guilty to be punished,'' West German Ambassador Horst
Kullak-Ublick told reporters after the court ordered the
investigation in a ruling Tuesday.
   West Germany has been pressing the Chilean courts to investigate
conditions at Dignity Colony in the Andean foothills 230 miles
south of Santiago. Former members of the colony, founded by German
immigrants in the early 1960s, allege they and other adherents were
tortured and exploited as slave labor.
   About 300 people, most of West German nationality, live at the
colony. Access to the enclave, which is surrounded by fencing, is
strictly controlled.

<HEAD>Committee Subpoenas North Notes In Narcotics Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra defendant Oliver North still
controls nearly 3,000 pages of top-secret notes he made while
working at the White House and has never fully shown them to
federal investigators, says a senator who wants the papers for an
international drug trafficking probe.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the notes which North made during
the years he oversaw a clandestine resupply effort for Nicaragua's
Contra rebels remain in the possession of North's lawyer, Brendan
Sullivan. Kerry said they have been shared with authorities only
after North and Sullivan blacked out large portions deemed by them
to be secret or irrelevant.
   Kerry said Tuesday that his congressional panel is subpoenaing
the notes taken by North, the former National Security Council aide
who is under indictment on conspiracy charges growing out of the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``I will not accept'' any determination of relevance made by
Sullivan or North, Kerry said as the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted 16-1 for the subpoena. Kerry said he would only
accept unexpurgated copies of the notebooks.
   ``He has no right to be telling us what is or isn't relevant,''
he added.
   One of the themes of North's defense is that forcing him to
stand trial will make public some of the nation's best-kept secrets
about covert operations.
   Kerry said he was making no claim that the deletions were
inappropriate or that Sullivan and North are hiding anything in the
classified documents.
   ``The issue is one of investigation,'' he said, vowing to pursue
the subpoena in court if necessary.
   Kerry's narcotics subcommittee has been investigating
allegations that the Contra resupply network was connected to a
Latin American drug-trafficking network and that U.S. officials
condoned the illicit activity because they were intent on keeping
the Contras in food and weapons.
   The Iran-Contra committees were given access to North's
notebooks, but only after 1,269 of the 2,848 pages were fully or
partly blacked out by North and Sullivan, or later by White House
censors.
   Kerry released 74 heavily censored pages from the notebooks on
Tuesday. Sprinkled throughout were references to drugs, the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Agency and the CIA. There are mentions of
Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted
in the United States on drug charges, and of others connected with
Nicaragua who are alleged to have been involved in drug trafficking.
   And there are references to Kerry and members of his staff,
indicating North seemed to be aware of and concerned about the
congressional investigation.
   Because of the extensive deletions, however, it is difficult to
know how significant the passages are.
   For example, an entry from the May 12, 1984, says CIA Latin
American chief Duane Clarridge had called and indicated that
``(name deleted) contact indicates that Gustavo is involved with
drugs.'' It is unclear to whom ``Gustavo'' refers.
   A July 24, 1984, entry states: ``Clarridge: (paragraph deleted)
_ Arturo Cruz Jr. _ Get Alfredo Cesar on drugs.''
   The entry's meaning is unclear. Cruz is the son of a former
member of the directorate of the United Nicaraguan Opposition, at
that time the Contra political umbrella. Cesar, now a member of the
Contra political directorate, was at the time associated with a
Contra group which was at odds with UNO.
   On the Foreign Relations panel, only Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
voted against issuing the subpoena, saying he did so because he
believed that North already bears too heavy a legal burden.

<HEAD>Children, Would-Be Parents Lose In Adoption Morass</HEAD>

   Children who need permanent homes and people
who long to be parents often miss each other in the morass of red
tape and expense of the adoption process, witnesses told a
congressional panel.
   The result is youngsters who spend years in foster care,
especially those who have special needs such as minorities, the
handicapped or carriers of the AIDS virus.
   Faith Daniels, a CBS News correspondent who is a co-anchor of
the network's morning news program, said at Tuesday's hearing by
the Congressional Coalition on Adoption that federal help is needed
to make the process easier for children and adults.
   ``Given what has happened in the world of adoption today, my
parents probably could not have been able to afford to adopt me,''
she said. ``I might have found a wealthier home, but I couldn't
have possibly found a more loving one.''
   Ms. Daniels was born in a home for unwed mothers, spent six
months in an orphanage and was adopted at the age of seven months
by Steve and Mary Skowronski of Washington, Pa.
   Her adoptive mother died last September and Ms. Daniels spoke
through tears as she described her parents: ``There are no better
parents than two people who make the commitment to adopt.''
   According to federal statistics, more than 140,000 children are
adopted each year. But there are more than 280,000 supported by
federal and state foster care funding. Of those, 36,000 are legally
free and waiting for adoption. Nearly half of those are blacks,
Hispanics, native Americans or children with special needs.
   Increasingly, social service agencies face the problem of
children who carry the AIDS virus, said Sister Maureen Joyce,
executive director of Community Maternity Services in Albany, N.Y.
Those children, who often languish for months in hospitals, ``will
need services for the rest of their lives,'' she said.
   An estimated 2 million couples of childbearing age are seeking
to adopt, in addition to about 1 million single people, according
to the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Ernesto Loperena, president of the North American Council on
Adoptable Children in New York, said that children in New York
often wait six years in foster homes before being adopted. He
attributed the problem to ``getting families through the system''
and adoption agency workers who ``often have ingrained ideas about
what constitutes an ideal family.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., noted that the cost of
adoptions runs between $5,000 and $10,000 and can go much higher.
The expenses are not tax deductible.
   She said she supports legislation to ensure unpaid but
job-protected leaves of absence for parents following the adoption
of a child. In addition, she said, families should not be barred
from adoption because both parents must work.
   ``Many agencies require one of the parents to be home for a
while to go through the bonding process (with the child). The
problem is we've got so many women in the workplace not because
they want to be but because they have to pay the mortgage,'' she
said.

   Two Connecticut College sophomores set
a world record for Frisbee-tossing but finally succumbed to the
need for sleep and ended their marathon session after more than
four days.
   Jeremy Tubb and John Fischer beat the previous record of 110
hours, 40 minutes at 7:40 a.m. Tuesday, and ended their streak at
3:36 p.m. after 118 hours and 36 minutes, said Daniel MacAlpine, a
college spokesman.
   The two had planned to toss the disk until 5 p.m. Tuesday, but
were beginning to hallucinate because of lack of sleep, MacAlpine
said.
   Tubb of Oklahoma City and Fischer of Maplewood, N.J., played
catch on a green between two dormitory buildings during daytime
hours and moved inside a student center building between 9 p.m. and
6 a.m.
   They were entitled to a five-minute break every hour, but
accumulated their time to take a nap at 6 a.m. each morning.
   The old record was set by Jamie Knerr and Keith Ziery between
Aug. 23-27, 1981 in Allentown, Pa., according to the Guinness Book
of World Records.
   To beat the record they had to make a 45-foot toss at least
13,282 times within the time period. The rules permitted record
challengers to drop the flying disk, but no one could help them
retrieve it.
   Cyd Smith, assistant editor of the Guinness Book in New York
City, said new records must be logged by witnesses and exceed
previous marks by a half-hour or an hour.

   The exotic Orient Express, which normally runs
between Paris and Istanbul, will be taking a 12,400-mile, 23-day
sentimental journey from Paris to Hong Kong next fall, the longest
train ride in history.
   A Japanese television network announced Tuesday that it will
charter the venerable train for a jaunt into the record books, with
stops in Cologne, East Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk
and Beijing.
   The cost for each of the 90 passengers: about $15,000.
   Travelers completing the journey will receive a certificate from
the Guinness Book of World Records affirming their participation in
the world's longest train trip, according to spokesmen for the Fuji
Television Network.
   Guinness lists the nine-day journey from Lisbon to Khabarovsk in
the Soviet Union as the longest rail journey on record.
   Orient Express '88 is being sponsored by Fuji in honor of the
network's 30th anniversary. Publicists for Fuji said the 16-car
train will depart Paris on Sept. 2 and is scheduled to arrive in
Hong Kong on Sept. 25.
   That will mark the end of the line for the 45 couples aboard _
15 each from America, Europe and Asia _ but the train will keep
going by ship to Japan, where it will be used for a series of
excursions for two more months.
   Among the difficulties involved in the journey are the different
gauges of track in Europe, the Soviet Union and Japan.
   Before entering the Soviet Union, the undercarriage of the train
will have to be replaced to accommodate the wider-gauge Soviet
track. The undercarriage will have to be replaced again at the
Sino-Soviet border, since Chinese gauge is the same as European,
and once again in Japan, to accommodate the narrower-gauge track
there, the sponsors said.
   Passengers will be treated to opera and ballet performances,
river cruises and a hovercraft tour of Lake Baikal in the Soviet
Union.
   The cuisine will vary along with the landscape. The chefs will
be French from Paris to Moscow, Russian from Moscow to Zabaikalsk
and Chinese from there to Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Government Reports Benefit Increases Average Nearly 6 Percent In
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worker benefits are growing at a higher rate
than wages, with escalating health insurance costs accounting for
most of the increase, the government says.
   Basic wage rates over the past 12 months have risen 2.6 percent
for union workers and 3.5 percent for non-union employees, the
Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday.
   But when benefits are included, the overall hourly cost of labor
in private industry increases at 3.9 percent for union members and
4 percent for non-union members.
   ``Some of these benefits have turned into entitlements, and just
like the government, a lot of businesses have lost control of
them,'' said Richard Belous, a labor economist for The Conference
Board, a business research house.
   Benefit increases in the 12 months ending April 1 have average
5.8 percent overall in private industry, double the 2.9 percent
increase of the previous 12 months, said the Labor Department
statisticians.
   And among blue-collar workers, benefit cost increases have
nearly tripled _ from a 2.3 percent gain a year ago to 6.8 percent
the past 12 months. In manufacturing, non-cash worker benefits rose
7 percent in the past year, compared with just 1.5 percent a year
earlier.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that employee fringe
benefits such as pension and health and dental insurance plans now
comprise an average 40 percent of a company's labor costs.
   The government said Tuesday that the bulk of the increase in
those costs in the past year was escalating health insurance
premiums, with a smaller portion coming from increased Social
Security contributions by employers.
   ``For a while, it looked like many employers were containing
health care costs,'' said Belous. ``But in the last year a lot of
the solutions have unraveled. With mandatory health insurance on
the horizon, a lot of companies are going to have to go back to the
drawing board.''
   John Zalusky, an economist for the AFL-CIO, said the stock
market crash last October explains much of the difference in the
size of benefit increases between union and non-union workers.
   ``Union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans,
which means that when the market crashed, they had to put more
money into the kitty,'' he said. ``Non-union employers have
switched more to defined contribution plans in which the
beneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash.''
   However, Zalusky acknowledged that unions also are being sent
signals from their members to get more benefits and job security
rather than cash at the bargaining table despite nominally lower
tax rates.
   Just last month, officials of the Teamsters union were told by
180,000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with the
trucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for bigger
employer contributions to health and pension plans.
   Many of those benefits, such as training programs and profit
sharing, bonus and employee stock ownership plans don't show up
fully in the government's collective bargaining and employment cost
figures, Zalusky said.
   ``The worker retraining programs negotiated with Ford, General
Motors and AT&T now constitute the largest privately endowed
education program in the country,'' he said, ``and they are nowhere
reflected in the data.''
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-year pay
increases in major union contracts negotiated in the first three
months of 1988 averaged only 2.1 percent, excluding cost-of-living
adjustments (COLA) and lump-sum bonuses.
   However, excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes _
often in exchange for profit-sharing, stock ownership or bonus
arrangements _ the average increase under the new contracts was 2.7
percent, the department said.
   Including the COLA payments and lump-sum or profit-sharing
bonuses from other, older contracts, the average effective wage
increase over the past 12 months under collective bargaining
agreements has been 3.8 percent, the government said.
   That compares favorably with both the 2.4 percent effective wage
increase a year earlier for union members and the 3.5 percent gain
the past 12 months for non-union workers.
   Earlier government data showed that union workers last year
maintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over non-union
workers _ $465 a week vs. $342 in 1987.

   Sen. Bob Dole says reporters covering the 1988
presidential election treat Democrats better than Republicans
because the journalists ``see the world through liberal-colored
glasses.''
   The Kansas Republican said in a floor speech Tuesday that
``there has long been a double standard when it comes to political
coverage.''
   ``Why the double standard? Well, look at the newsrooms,'' Dole
said. ``Let's face it, they tend to be liberal. In all honesty, how
many Republicans are out there covering the candidates? Or
Congress?''
   Dole, who has dropped out of the race for the GOP presidential
nomination, said reporters ``try to be objective. But try as they
do, they just can't help but see the world through liberal-colored
glasses.''
   ``Maybe it's all the result of the Vietnam years, or Watergate
fallout, or some kind of generational distrust of Republicans,''
Dole said.
   Dole said a USA Today study of television news ``reveals that
Republican candidates received far more negative treatment than the
Democratic candidates.''
   ``This trend, however, was not limited to the TV screen,'' Dole
said. ``In my view, it was prevalent in the major newspapers and
the weekly news magazines, too.''
   He said overall coverage of the primaries has been ``issueless
and negative.''
   ``Unfortunately, the American people are not getting what they
want, at least not from the news media,'' Dole said.
   ``It's a shame the media can't keep up with the people,'' he
said. ``What I witnessed generally on my own campaign plane was an
aircraft filled with reporters who became each other's best
audience. It was an ultra-insider's game of gossip and nit-picking
that turned presidential campaign coverage into `Trivial Pursuits.'
   ``It was a daily spin from the `experts' on the state of the
campaign, whether it came from a reporter who had been on board for
one month or one stop,'' Dole said. ``It didn't matter.
Preconceived notions, prewritten stories and premeditated cliches
were all confirmed regardless of the facts.''

   The chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board says inspections are urgently needed for bridges built
like the New York State Thruway span that collapsed last year,
killing 10 people.
   ``We know there are 43,000 bridges around the country that have
not been inspected even in the last two years,'' NTSB Chairman Jim
Burnett said Tuesday. ``Many of those that have been inspected
during that period may not have gotten underwater inspection.
   ``We believe there are many other bridges _ perhaps thousands _
in the country that were built basically as the Schoharie Creek
Bridge was.''
   Burnett recommended that the Federal Highway Administration
require the states to inspect such bridges ``as quickly as
possible.''
   Burnett made his remarks after the board completed its yearlong
investigation into the collapse of the Schoharie Creek Bridge on
the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, about 40 miles northwest of
Albany, N.Y.
   The span fell April 5, 1987, after days of heavy rain and
flooding. Four cars and one tractor-trailer truck plunged into the
creek, and one body has never been recovered.
   The board concluded that the probable cause of the disaster was
failure by the New York State Thruway Authority to replace riprap,
or large boulders, around bridge piers.
   Some of the boulders washed away, leading to severe erosion in
the creek bed beneath the bridge footings. Thatin turn caused a
pier to buckle and the entire bridge to give way, a report by the
NTSB staff concluded.
   The NTSB's conclusion differed from that of the state Disaster
Preparedness Commission last December, primarily in that the
federal agency pointed a finger at the state Thruway Authority. The
riprap problem had been uncovered during investigations and
hearings last year.
   The Thruway Authority had not yet seen the report and would not
comment, spokesman Arthur Isabel said from Albany, N.Y.

   The Agriculture Department has begun its
spring push to hire 100 new scientists for top-drawer research
projects.
   Under the department's Research Associate Program, now in its
ninth year, the scientists will join veteran researchers to work on
projects as diverse as biotechnology and groundwater.
   Mary E. Carter, acting administrator of the department's
Agricultural Research Service, said Tuesday the program rules
require job candidates to have earned a doctoral degree in the past
three years.
   ``Talented new scientists will be hired for up to two years to
work alongside top-notch researchers around the country,'' she
said. ``We will provide more than $4 million in funds for these
associates.''
   Carter said that the agency for the first time will have a
research associate based at each of four historically black
colleges and universities. Those are: Fort Valley State College,
Georgia; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State
University; Prairie View A&M University, Texas; and University of
Maryland-Eastern Shore.
   Each of the new scientists will work full time on one of 100
projects selected from 203 proposed by agency scientists in
laboratories and research centers across the country, she said.
   The 100 new research associates will be offered salaries ranging
from $27,716 to $33,218 per year.
   ``Our associates provide a steady flow of new ideas and
techniques to help us solve significant problems in food and
agriculture,'' Carter said. ``For example, thanks to one of the
first research associates, we're about to test a new cattle vaccine
in cooperation with a California biotech firm. That researcher now
works at our U.S. Livestock Insects Laboratory in Kerrville,
Texas.''
   Each year an award is given by the agency for the most
outstanding project proposal. This year's was won by animal
physiologist Lawrence A. Johnson, who is working on selecting the
sex of livestock before birth at the agency's animal reproduction
laboratory, Beltsville, Md.
   Other projects selected for the Research Associate Program
include:
   _Learning how newly discovered natural carbohydrates prevent
browning of fruits and vegetables, and using them as safe
subsitutes for banned sulfites in salad bars.
   _Determining the amount of fertilizer nitrogen that flows into
groundwater through channels made by earthworms, insects and
decaying plant roots.
   _Assessing boron as an essential element, as new studies
suggest, in the diet of people and animals.
   _Developing a vaccine against salmonella in chickens.
   _Isolating a chemical in parasitic wasps that could be used as a
natural insecticide against 45 kinds of insects that cause
billion-dollar crop losses.
   _Producing antibodies, or specially developed proteins, to
detect viruses of soybeans and other crops.
   _Studying the effects of different tillage and crop combinations
on above- and below-ground movement of pesticides and other
chemicals.
   _Using X-rays to analyze soil clay as an aid in predicting
pesticide movement to groundwater.

   Cold, wet weather has slowed spring planting
and crop development in a large part of the nation's farmbelt, says
the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
   ``Precipitation slowed planting in the central and southern
Great Plains, Delta and Southeast,'' the facility reported Tuesday.
``The cold weather slowed wheat growth in the northern and central
Great Plains and Corn Belt.''
   Dry conditions continued to hamper winter wheat growth in the
northern plains, while disease and insects were the main problems
in central areas.
   The facility, which is operated by the departments of
Agriculture and Commerce, said corn planting was about 15 percent
completed in the major producing states by April 24, ahead of the
11 percent pace of a year ago and the long-term average progress of
9 percent by this time.
   ``Planting was under way in all states except Michigan and South
Dakota,'' the report said. ``Seeding surpassed the average in
nearly all states, (although) below-normal and sometimes freezing
temperatures slowed planting in some Corn Belt states.

   James W. Glosser has been named by Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng as administrator of the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
   Glosser was acting head of the Agriculture Department agency
since the death in February of Donald L. Houston. The job pays
$75,500 a year.
   The agency, which calls itself APHIS, oversees a number of
federal regulatory programs affecting the nation's livestock and
plants.
   Glosser received a doctorate in veterinary medicine from
Washington State University and worked from 1966 to 1973 for the
Centers for Disease Control, U.S. Public Health Service, as a
veterinary epidemiologist.
   After that, Glosser worked for the Montana Department of
Livestock as chief of the disease control bureau and later as head
of the animal health division. He joined the USDA agency in 1983 as
assistant administrator and held the number two position of
associated administrator at the time of Houston's death.
   Lyng said Tuesday that the appointment was effective immediately.

   The cure for almost all of the 20 million
American men suffering from impotence is in the doctor's office,
not on the psychiatrist's couch, according to a Boston specialist.
   Dr. Irwin Goldstein, associate professor of urology at the
Boston University School of Medicine, said at a seminar Tuesday
that the most frequent cause of impotence is blood circulation
problems that do not allow patients to acquire or retain an
erection.
   In almost no cases, he said, is the problem exclusively in the
mind, a concept that has long been a popular belief.
   ``Whether there is a Freudian subconscious thing that can cause
penile insufficiency, I really doubt that,'' Goldstein said at a
National Kidney Foundation seminar. ``For the most part,
psychological factors are usually secondary to other problems.''
   In most clinical treatments, he said, ``the urologist has
replaced the psychologist and psychiatrist'' as the treatment
specialist for impotence.
   An erection, Goldstein said, is essentially a function of
hydraulics. Following appropriate inspiration, a neurotransmitter
substance is secreted to start the sequence. Next, blood flowing
into the penis is prevented by muscle action from flowing back out.
Structures called the lecunar space then fill and force enlargement
of the organ.
   The process can be blocked by three general mechanisms: a
failure to initiate caused by impaired release of the
neurotransmitter substances; a failure to fill, caused by impaired
blood flow into the organ; and a failure to store, caused by an
impairment that does not allow the blood to fill the lecunar space
and force enlargement.
   Goldstein said injection of a medication that triggers muscle
action to prevent blood from flowing out of the penis has been
successful in overcoming impotence in 350 patients at his clinic.
He said patients or their spouses routinely learn how to administer
the injection and the technique has been generally successful in
appropriate cases.
   Another solution involves the surgical repair of arterial blood
flow. Goldstein said this can involve removing blockages from the
cavernosal artery that supplies the penis or, in the case of
injury, reconnecting severed arteries. Still another solution is to
surgically alter the return flow of blood which would enable it to
pool and cause an erection.
   If such solutions fail or are inappropriate, Goldstein said,
there is the penile implant, a mechanical device that will force an
erection. He said this has been effective 90 percent of the time.
Infection and ``device malfunction'' have been the only major
problems.
   Vascular problems, the same kind that cause heart disease, are
by far the major cause of impotence, he said.
   ``Impotence may be the first indication of cardiovascular
disease,'' Goldstein said.
   This means, he said, that a lifestyle such as smoking and
high-fat diets that can lead to heart disease may first lead to a
disappointing sexual life.
   ``Cigarette smoking and a high cholesterol diet are all bad for
sexual function,'' he said.

   At least 35 people died of anthrax in
western Ghana after eating infected beef, a public health official
said.
   The official, Dr. G.E. Yelwere, said on Tuesday that the
outbreak was detected April 15 when six people died from the
disease in Jirapa and an investigation indicated that 25 cattle
with anthrax had died in the area.
   The Ministry of Agriculture has banned the slaughter of cattle
and the consumption of beef in the region. Yelwere said a medical
team has vaccinated 1,600 cattle against the disease.
   Anthrax normally infects cattle and sheep and can be transmitted
to humans as a spore-forming bacterium. The disease causes external
ulcerations and lesions in the lungs.

<HEAD>First Woman Appointed To Federal Trial Court Dead At 93</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burnita Shelton Matthews, a senior judge on
the U.S. District Court here and the first woman appointed to a
federal trial court, died after a stroke at the age of 93.
   Mrs. Matthews, who died Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital, was
named to the bench by President Harry Truman in 1949 and assumed
senior status in 1968, allowing her to go into semiretirement while
still hearing cases.
   In the 1970s, she was designated to sit on the U.S. Court of
Customs and Patent Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, and she remained active in the District Court
until September 1983.
   Earlier in her career, she had practiced law for almost 30 years
and had developed a reputation as an advocate for women's rights.
   One of her most notable cases was when she presided over the
1957 trial of Jimmy Hoffa, the former president of the Teamsters
Union. He was acquitted of bribery charges.
   While sitting on the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1971, she ruled
that disabled people receiving benefits from the Social Security
Administration were entitled to hearings before their benefits were
terminated.
   President Reagan in 1984 wrote to her that ``in furthering the
administration of justice in our legal system,'' her ``diligence,
distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit serve as an inspiration
to all....''
   Mrs. Matthews studied law at the National University Law School,
now part of George Washington Univerity, and received her degree in
1919. Her husband, retired Army Lt. Col. Percy A. Matthews, died in
1969. She left no immediate survivors.

   Congress must soon raise military salaries or
accept a decline in readiness as more officers and enlisted
personnel decide against re-enlisting because of financial
uncertainty, the Navy's top officer says.
   ``It's a problem that I think this country is going to have to
wake up to pretty soon if they're going to maintain their ready
forces,'' said Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the chief of naval
operations, in an interview.
   Trost acknowledged that he was running up against congressional
efforts to cope with the national deficit by trimming the budget,
but he said:
   ``The big thing that people do not understand is that when you
don't retain a trained person, you don't save money by bringing in
an untrained person. It costs you several times _ anywhere from two
to 10 times as much _ to re-train a replacement ... (than it does)
to provide the special bonuses that were required to retain the guy
you had on board.''
   Congress is also cutting the budget for operations and
maintenance to ``inadequate'' levels, the four-star admiral said.
   ``Readiness is a hard thing to measure,'' Trost said. ``You
don't put a dollar figure on readiness generally because no one can
appreciate that.
   ``What they appreciate is the fact that in last week's
engagements (with Iran), for example, everything went right for our
guys and wrong for the other guy,'' he continued.
   ``Had it been the other way around, you can imagine the hue and
cry we'd hear in this town right now,'' he said. ``And the only
solution would be to hack off the heads of a few people like me,
rather than blaming anybody who had any responsibility for the
budget cuts that might have led to such a situation.''
   Trost, the Navy's military leader for almost two years now, was
interviewed in his Pentagon office Tuesday. On other topics, the
58-year-old admiral:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Expressed great satisfaction with the fleet's performance in
the Persian Gulf on April 18, when six Iranian vessels were sunk or
crippled without a single American ship being hit. But he warned
that U.S. warships could never be expected to counter all Iranian
attacks on merchant ships in the gulf.
   _Agreed that Pentagon officials were surprised the Iranians came
out to fight last week after the United States destroyed two
offshore platforms in retaliation for the mining of the frigate
Samuel B. Roberts.
   _Disclosed that the three sailors missing from last Sunday's
explosion and fire aboard the diesel submarine Bonefish ``were on
watch in the ship's control room and were last seen there.''
   ``So it may well be that they simply ensured that everyone got
clear and they themselves didn't make it.''
   In discussing military salaries, Trost dismissed a recent
General Accounting Office report suggesting servicemen were better
paid than Civil Service workers.
   ``The average civil servant in Washington is earning a
considerably higher salary than the guy who deploys for six months
at a time or the guy who's just had his ship mined or the guy whose
submarine just exploded,'' Trost said.

   Comedians Billy Crystal and Paul Rodriguez joked

Street Clinic for the homeless in downtown Denver.
   The clinic, whose official opening was today in a former
Universal Studios building, is the first recipient of $2 million
raised by more than 50 comedians during the 1987 Comic Relief,
supported and televised by Home Box Office last November.
   Health care for the homeless in 22 other cities also will be

   One goal of the benefit was to increase awareness of the
problem, Rodriguez said.
   ``When you think of the homeless, you think of bums; that's why
people have a hard time digging in their pockets,'' Rodriguez said.
``I walked into a center, I saw children with their mothers.''

   Placido Domingo, one of the biggest draws in
opera, has pulled out of the title role in Wagner's ``Lohengrin''
this summer at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the management
said.
   Domingo was to have sung in five performances from June 20
through July 6, and Covent Garden was depending on him to be the
big attraction of its season.
   His appearance also was to be a send-off for Sir John Tooley,
the retiring general director for whom Domingo has sung in each of
his seasons since 1970.
   An opera house statement issued Tuesday said Domingo decided to
withdraw Lohengrin from his repertoire ``for the moment.''
   ``He reached the decision with great regret but since he has not
sung it on stage recently he would need more time than he has
available to re-prepare the role,'' the statement said.

   Rock star Mick Jagger got some
satisfaction from a federal court jury, which rejected a reggae
musician's claim that Jagger had pirated his song ``Just Another
Night.''
   Fans who had packed the small courtroom burst into applause
after the verdict was read Tuesday.
   ``My reputation is really cleared,'' Jagger said. ``If you're
well-known, people stand up and take shots at you. It's one of
those things in a litigious society.''
   Patrick Alley, 36, of New York City, had accused Jagger of
copyright infringement, claiming the chorus of Jagger's song was
lifted from Alley's 1979 tune, also called ``Just Another Night.''
   ``I still believe and I know that's my song,'' Alley said.
   The six-member U.S. District Court jury, which began
deliberating late Monday, had listened to tapes of the development
of Jagger's song as well as of Alley's.
   Jagger's song appeared on the first album he recorded without
the Rolling Stones, called ``She's the Boss.'' Alley's lawyers
claimed it earned $6 million.

<HEAD>INS Deadline Prompts Surge In Applications For Amnesty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY RYCKMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of aliens are jamming U.S. immigration centers as the
amnesty program's deadline loomed a week from today, and officials
warned immigrants not to count on an extension of the cutoff date.
   In Houston, there was standing room only Tuesday inside the
Immigration and Naturalization Service office, Texas' busiest, and
a line of applicants snaked around the building throughout the day.
   Officials processed about 1,600 applications Monday and another
1,600 Tuesday. About 100,000 people were expected to apply for
amnesty through the Houston office by May 4, twice the number
initially predicted.
   ``There's too much people standing in line,'' said Marco
Canamar, an applicant standing in line. ``I don't think they have
enough time to process all the people.''
   Immigration officials likened the filing frenzy by aliens
seeking legal status to the mad rush by last-minute tax filers on
April 15.
   ``These applicants are just like anyone else when it comes to
procrastinating, just like you and I on tax day,'' said John Roark,
an INS spokesman in Dallas.
   Nationwide, officials originally projected up to 4 million
undocumented aliens would apply. That estimate fell to 2 million.
So far, the INS has received 1.2 million general amnesty
applications and 400,000 applications under the more liberal
seasonal agricultural worker program.
   Under provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, illegal immigrants must prove they have lived in the United
States continuously since before Jan. 1, 1982, in order to be
eligible for legal residency status.
   The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to extend
the cutoff date from midnight May 4 to Nov. 30, but the bill faces
strong opposition in the Senate and a possible presidential veto.
INS officials oppose an extension of the year-long program.
   ``It would be sending the wrong signal, that would encourage
people not now in the country to enter the country,'' Roark said.
``We would see another big surge in November if the deadline is
approved.''
   Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson on Tuesday urged
Congress to support an extension.
   ``Surely our great nation can find it in our hearts and souls to
give six months more for freedom,'' Jackson said. ``Lincoln is
watching. Martin Luther King is watching. Give freedom a chance.''
   Until recent weeks, INS officials had been disappointed by the
low number of applicants, and launched a media blitz to promote the
program. The effort included radio shows, a parade float, street
parties, bumper stickers and billboards.
   The number of applicants jumped as the deadline approached,
prompting immigration offices nationwide to extend their hours and
stay open on weekends to process applications.
   In Boston, 352 illegal aliens applied for amnesty during the
week of April 10 and 400 applied last week.
   ``Those were both record weeks for us,'' said Roger Nye,
director of the INS amnesty program in Boston. So far, 7,583 people
have applied for amnesty, and the office has recommended approving
more than 95 percent of them.
   Immigrants from more than 100 countries requested amnesty in
Boston, with about half Hispanic, a fifth Haitian and a sixth
Chinese, he said, adding that the list included 101 Irish
nationals, 166 Nigerians, 110 Liberians and 100 Poles.
   In recent weeks the number of applicants has doubled in the INS
western district, comprised of California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii
and Guam.
   On April 18, the western region processed 3,521 new applications
for legalization. On Monday, it received 6,802 applications, said
Joyce Leonard, INS acting assistant director for immigration reform
in Los Angeles.
   In Arizona alone, 42,247 people have applied for amnesty, with
21,311 seeking legalization and 20,936 applying under the special
agricultural workers program, said Richard Perry, INS regional
deputy director in Phoenix.
   ``I'm pleasantly surprised that we have had such a dramatic
increase in the past two months,'' Perry said. ``Already we have
received more applications in April than in any month since the
program began.''

<HEAD>Meese Calls for Drug Tests of Everyone Arrested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III says everyone
who is arrested should be tested for drugs and then should be
subject to follow-up tests before trial.
   ``I would like to see the day where every person arrested is
subjected to a urine test'' to determine suitability for pre-trial
release, Meese told mayors and police chiefs Tuesday at the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.
   He said once defendants are back on the street, they should be
subject to random drug testing to dissuade them from committing
crimes while awaiting trial. Meese added he would like to see
mandatory drug testing results taken into account in sentencing by
judges.
   Meese later told a reporter a proposal embracing such an
approach is ``a part of our user accountability strategy that is
being developed at the present time'' by the National Drug Policy
Board, a Cabinet-level panel which Meese chairs.
   If the proposal is adopted, it would take legislation to
implement the plan, said Justice Department spokesman Patrick
Korten.
   Meese also said mandatory drug tests ought to be administered to
users in drug treatment programs ``to make them accountable.''
   Meese said such approaches are part of the Reagan
administration's philosophy of ``recognizing that the user is not a
victim as some would suggest but rather that the user is a vital
participant in drug trafficking.''
   Meese claimed that the proposals don't present constitutional
problems, but didn't elaborate. Civil liberties groups vehemently
disagree, saying that under the Constitution defendants are
supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.
   A constitutional challenge to pre-trial testing of criminal
suspects in the District of Columbia is before a U.S. District
Court in Washington.
   Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, denounced Meese's comments in a telephone interview from his
New York City home Tuesday night.
   ``All of Meese's statements over the years are designed to sound
tough on crime but are not tough on crime. ...,'' Glasser said.
``He should understand as well as anybody that being a suspect
you're not guilty of anything.''
   Regarding the proposal for workplace drug testing, Glasser said,
``These proposals threaten the innocent more than they do the
guilty.''
   Despite his tough talk, Meese came under sharp questioning from
several Democratic mayors who questioned whether he is doing an
adequate job of directing the nation's war on drugs.
   The mayors and police chiefs say more federal aid for drug
education and law enforcement is needed to combat trafficking and
that the United States should stop sending foreign aid to countries
that continue to allow drugs to flow from their nations to the
United States.
   ``The policy by the federal government isn't a policy,''
Providence, R.I., Mayor Joseph Paolino complained to Meese.
   ``We don't see how the federal government is really working in
partnership with the communities,'' said Paolino. ``Maybe it is on
paper, maybe it is in structure, but it isn't in reality.''
   Meese responded that the Reagan administration is working on
drug eradication and interdiction programs with governments in
several South American countries in an attempt to cut the supply of
cocaine into the United States by up to 50 percent over three years.
   Meese said Justice Department officials ``will be glad'' to meet
with the mayors and city police chiefs ``as often as you want'' to
discuss drug-fighting strategies.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney J. Barthelemy argued the federal
government should appoint a drug czar whose sole responsibility is
to direct the attack on drug trafficking and use.
   ``I have the same power with regard to narcotics and the
National Drug Policy Board as the surgeon general has with regard
to AIDS,'' replied Meese.
   Meese told the group that 33 congressional panels have
jurisdiction over the drug problem.
   ``Those generals that you're talking about are spending more of
their time testifying before a variety of committees in Congress
than they are leading the charge against narcotics,'' said Meese.

   The New York City Ballet had a great big
wonderful surprise for its audience at Tuesday night's opening of
the company's three-week American Music Festival.
   Suzanne Farrell, the beloved ballerina who returned to the
company in the winter season after a hip replacement operation, had
a dance, ``Sophisticated Lady,'' choreographed for her by Peter
Martins. As she danced to the Ellington music, backed by a male
chorus, Martins _ who retired from dancing in 1983 _ came out and
danced with her.
   They were more elegant than one remembered, more romantic than
Fred and Ginger.
   And they followed Patricia McBride and Robert LaFosse dancing
``The Man I Love'' from George Balanchine's ``Who Cares?'' sung by
Frederica Von Stade. We thought nothing could be more
stars-in-the-sky than that Gershwin presentation, but
``Sophisticated Lady'' was.
   The rest of the program was big-league stuff, too. Leonard
Bernstein began, conducting the orchestra and New York Choral
Society on the stage of the New York State Theater in the first
movement of his ``Chichester Psalms.''
   Martins, co-ballet master in chief with Jerome Robbins, welcomed
the audience to the festival which celebrates 40 years since the
October 1944 program when the company, previously Ballet Society,
was first called the New York City Ballet.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said the company is ``honoring its
traditions by breaking new ground.''
   New ground was then broken with ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' by Lar
Lubovitch, who has his own modern dance company and never
choreographed for this company before. Lubovitch masterfully brings
Gershwin's music into movement and creates a dance which suits for
the New York City Ballet.
   The company danced the fourth movement of Balanchine's ``Western
Symphony,'' to Hershy Kay music, enthusiastically led by Maria
Calegari and Leonid Kozlov. Jerome Robbins going modern to Philip
Glass music, ``Glass Pieces,'' was danced.
   Miss Von Stade sang two engaging, simple songs by Ned Rorem.
   The evening ended with the bravura dancing of Kyra Nichols and
Jock Soto in the fourth and fifth campaign of Balanchine's ``Stars
and Stripes'' and the unfurling of the flag. The music, of course,
is by John Philip Sousa. You can't start an American music festival
in a more American way than this.

   ``A Different World'' topped the A.C. Nielsen
Co. ratings last week, and for that you can blame a different
season.
   With longer daylight luring viewers away from the largely rerun
fare of network television, the Cosby-show spinoff had a rating of
23.6, putting its parent show in second place with a rating of 22.9.
   The rest of the top 10 were ``Cheers'' NBC, ``Golden Girls''
NBC, ``When the Bough Breaks'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS, ``ALF''
NBC, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC, ``L.A. Law'' NBC and ``Who's the
Boss?'' ABC.
   Only ``60 Minutes,'' ``L.A. Law'' and ``The Wonder Years'' were
first-run.
   The traditional television season ended a week ago and the May
sweeps period, an important local ratings period, doesn't begin
until the end of this week, so the networks are saving their
remaining originals.
   The combined network rating for the week that ended Sunday was
37.3, a drop from the season average of 43.1. The networks'
combined share of the viewing audience dropped from an average 71
percent to 64 percent.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions.
   For the week, NBC had a prime-time average rating of 14.0, CBS
12.2 and ABC 11.1. The season-to-date averages are: NBC 16.0, ABC
13.7 and CBS 13.4.
   NBC continues to trail and is falling even further behind in
news. For the week that ended Friday, the ``CBS Evening News'' had
a 10.7 rating, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' 10.4, and ``NBC Nightly
News'' 8.7.
   NBC has commissioned a special Nielsen survey to try to find out
why the rating fell as soon as the new people-meter rating system
was instituted last autumn. Before then, the news show had been No.
1 for most of the year.
   In prime time, the lowest-rated shows last week were: ``Peter
Beard in Africa,'' ``Beverly Hills Buntz,'' ``Tour of Duty,''
``Ohara,'' ``West 57th,'' ``The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,''
``Dolly!'' ``48 Hours,'' ``Our House'' and ``Hotel.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A knock on the door in the middle of the
evening. Then, the dreaded words: ``Sanitation police.''
   New York may have trouble educating its children or maintaining
its bridges, but when the city says ``Post No Bills,'' it means it.
   The Sanitation Department has embarked on a campaign to enforce
a law against placing posters on public property, including ``any
gutter, flagstone, tree, lamppost, awning post, telegraph pole,
telephone pole, public utility pole, garbage bin, bus shelter,
elevated train structure, highway fence, barrel, box or hydrant.''
   Not to mention City Hall.
   A team of sanitation police has been going from door to door,
issuing summonses with fines between $50 and $250.
   During the past six months, the city has issued more than 15,000
summonses and collected about $142,000 in fines, according to Vito
Turso, Sanitation Department spokesman.
   Sanitation officers do not carry guns, only summons pads and
two-way radios, which ``they've had to use to fend off some
offenders,'' Turso said. ``There hasn't been any violence, but
they're treated like the grim reaper.''
   One of those served was Michael Barry, a music teacher whose
home was visited by three sanitation policemen one night in
February. They left behind 61 summonses worth $50 each for guitar
and piano lesson ads tacked to utility poles in Manhattan's East
Village section.
   Through newspaper ads, Barry reached other alleged offenders and
formed the Victims of Poster Police to fight the sanctions. A May 4
demonstration is planned outside Sanitation headquarters.
   The city administrative code provision, passed in September,
differs from the previous law in that it imposes strict liability
for the posters on whoever is named on them. In the past,
authorities had to catch someone in the act of posting.
   But Kenneth Lo, a Brooklyn kung fu instructor, said he was fined
$1,000 for 22 leaflets tacked up by a 10-year-old student. He
claims he wasn't even aware they were being put up.
   Illegal posting charges are considered by the city's
Environmental Control Board, which has dismissed ``quite a few'' of
the cases, according to board spokeswoman Tina Casey.
   Barry said the fines are unfair and the law is an
unconstitutional restriction on expression.
   Turso was unsympathetic. ``These people are visually polluting
New York City,'' he said. ``They should consider buying billboard
space.''
   A billboard may not be a realistic medium for music teachers or
palm readers, but Turso said the posters' environmental impact must
be considered.
   ``They not only tack or tape them to telephone poles, they GLUE
them,'' he complained. ``That makes it almost impossible to get
off.''

<HEAD>Proposal To Cut Production Could Raise Oil Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   VIENNA, Austria _ If seven independent oil-producing nations and
OPEC adopt a proposal to cut their exports by 5 percent, they could
reverse the recent decline in oil prices caused by excess supplies,
an analyst said.
   ``If they agreed to it, it would be very positive'' for the oil
market, said Paul Mlotok, an analyst for the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc., who was in Vienna to observe talks between
the two groups.
   The proposal was made Tuesday. If it is adopted, it will be the
first such accord with outside oil producers in OPEC's 28-year
history.
   On the New York Mercantile Echange on Tuesday, contracts for
June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
closed 20 cents higher at $18.60 per barrel, partly in reaction to
reports of the proposal.
   Mexico's oil minister, Fernando Hiriart, said he conveyed the
offer to representatives of the 13-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries on behalf of Mexico and six other independent
oil producers _ Egypt, China, Colombia, Malaysia, Oman and Angola.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Hiriart told reporters the
suggested cutbacks would be for May and June only. He added that
the basis for calculating the reductions would be the average oil
export level of each country over the past six months.
   Hiriart said his government ``shares OPEC's objective'' of
driving prices back up to the cartel's official target of $18 per
barrel. Most OPEC oil currently is selling for $14 to $15 a barrel.
   Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, the president of OPEC, called the
offer ``a good beginning.''
   The independent producers presented their offer at a meeting
with six OPEC members. The two groups were scheduled to meet again
this afternoon for a final day of closed-door deliberations.
   Venezuela's oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, told
reporters the six OPEC officials were not authorized to make any
decisions on the non-OPEC offer. He said details of the proposal
would be passed on to all OPEC countries at a meeting in Vienna on
Thursday.
   Hiriart declined to say what Mexico or the other independent
producers would do if OPEC did not agree to the offer.
   ``We are ready to implement these measures when we find the
adequate proportional response from OPEC,'' Hiriart said, adding
that this meant a ``volume cut equivalent to 5 percent of its
exports.''
   He said a 5 percent cut by the non-OPEC group would amount to
about 200,000 barrels a day. He added it was unclear exactly what
the 5 percent reduction for OPEC would amount to in barrels per day.
   OPEC exports about 14 million barrels of its collective oil
production of between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels a day. A
5 percent cut would appear to mean an export reduction of 700,000
barrels daily.
   OPEC itself is sharply divided about whether to reduce its
production, although it has long welcomed collaborative efforts by
independent oil producers.
   One of the main obstacles to an OPEC agreement on reducing its
oil output is Iraq's refusal to cooperate. Iraq is not party to an
existing OPEC production-limiting agreement because its demand for
a production quota equal to that of Iran was denied. The two
nations have been at war since 1980.
   Iraq is believed to be pumping at least 2.5 million barrels
daily, more than any other OPEC member except Saudi Arabia. Iran
produces roughly 2 million barrels daily.
   A further complication for OPEC is Saudi Arabia's decision
Tuesday to break diplomatic relations with Iran. Although this was
not expected to stop the oil ministers of both countries from
sitting together at the OPEC negotiating table, it could cast a
shadow over efforts to agree on cartel policy moves.
   Regardless of the outcome of OPEC's talks with the independent
producers, members of both groups said the meetings were important
for the long-term development of the world oil market.
   ``It is the beginning of a new stage of cooperation between a
large number of oil-producing countries,'' Hiriart said. ``It is
hoped that other countries will join in the effort.''

   The Metropolitan Opera filed a lawsuit seeking
to ring down the curtain on a bebop, jazz band that calls itself
the ``Metropolitan Bopera House.''
   In its trademark infringement suit against the jazz quintet, the
Met claimed the ``virtually identical'' name ``is likely to cause
confusion, deception, mistake.''
   But John Marshall, one of the founding members of the
Metropolitan Bopera House, called Tuesday's lawsuit ``pretty silly,
because we're no threat to them in any way. After all we're playing
different kinds of music.''
   Bebop is a form of improvisational swing popularized by Charlie
``Bird'' Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, said Marshall.
   Henry W. Lauterstein, general counsel for the Met, declined to
comment further, saying he'd let court papers call the tune.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, seeks a restraining
order against Metropolitan Bopera House to keep them ``from
unfairly competing'' with the Met.
   ``After playing smoke-filled dates and struggling to assert
itself in the rough jazz business, it is difficult for our group to
see how we could possibly threaten the opera, which seems to feel
it has exclusive rights to the word `metropolitan,''' said
Marshall, a 35-year-old trumpeter from Brooklyn.
   The opera house also wants the Bopera House to turn over all
their records, labels, advertising _ and anything else with the
offending name _ for destruction.
   According to the lawsuit, the Metropolitan Opera has been the
Metropolitan Opera since 1883 and even registered that name and
``Met'' as trademarks. The Met also sought an accounting of
Metropolitan Bopera House's profits and unspecified damages for
alleged ``willful and wanton, unfair competition and unfair
business practices.''
   The lawsuit claimed the boppers ``obviously intended to connote
a connection or association'' with the Met and were stealing ``its
name, good will and reputation.''
   Not so, said Marshall, noting that his band, founded 100 years
after the Met, took its moniker from a nickname for the Royal
Roost, a popular Manhattan jazz club of the 1940s.

<HEAD>US May Allow Some Citizens, Companies To Make Payments to Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is trying to
negotiate an agreement under which Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega would retain power for a time rather than go into immediate
exile, a published report says.
   The Washington Post reported today the compromise plan was
presented last week to the military strongman by Michael Kozak,
deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
   The report, which cites unidentified U.S. and diplomatic
sources, says the plan backs away from administration demands for
Noriega's immediate ouster as commander of the Panamanian Defense
Forces.
   State Department spokeswoman Ellen Bork had no comment on
Kozak's trip to Panama, but said there has been no change in the
administration's position that ``Noriega has to step down and leave
Panama unconditionally'' at once. Kozak did not return telephone
calls to his residence late Tuesday.
   In another development, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Tuesday the administration was considering some exemptions to
the order prohibiting payments to Panama by U.S. citizens and
companies operating there.
   The spokesman, in remarks to reporters, described them as
``hardship case exemptions'' and denied the administration was
considering a sweeping reduction of its sanctions directed against
Noriega.
   As part of its attempt to oust Noriega, the administration cut
off all economic and military aid last year. Earlier this year, it
withheld fees for use of the Panama Canal and barred U.S. banks
from transferring fees to the Noriega regime.
   Noriega is under indictment in Florida on drug-trafficking
charges.
   On April 8, Reagan invoked the International Emergency Economic
Act, which barred U.S. citizens, companies and their subsidiaries
from making any payments to the Panamanian government.
   Fitzwater said no decision had yet been made on exemptions to
the act and he could offer no timetable for one.
   The spokesman said the exemptions would allow payments for such
things as ``rent and garbage bills'' so as not to make conditions
unduly hard on U.S. small businesses and citizens operating in
Panama.
   Asked if the exemptions amounted to an admission by the
administration that its sanctions had not been able to force
Noriega from office, Fitzwater said, ``This is a signal to Noriega
that the (other) sanctions are staying ... This means we're
settling in for the long term.''
   He said that when the April 8 decision was announced, the
administration said it would consider exemptions to the order.

<HEAD>Two-Thirds of Pennsylvania's Jackson Voters Would Back Dukakis In
November</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Primary Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis showed new strength in the
Pennsylvania primary, drawing support from elements of the
Democratic Party as disparate as Jesse Jackson voters and the
Reagan Democrats of 1984, exit polls say.
   The Massachusetts governor for the first time Tuesday found a
majority of his backers supporting him strongly, the polls said.
Dukakis, whose margin of victory was better than 2-1, won every
group but blacks, who favored Jackson almost unanimously.
   Still, two-thirds of Jackson's voters said they would support
Dukakis as the nominee against George Bush in November, an ABC
News-Washington Post poll said. And a CBS News-New York Times poll
said 58 percent of Jackson's backers expressed a favorable view of
Dukakis.
   ``If I were in Dukakis' campaign I'd be jumping for joy,'' said
CBS News pollster Keating Holland. ``He's going to have a good,
strong candidacy. He's not going to be a default candidate by any
means.''
   While many Jackson voters showed a willingness to support
Dukakis, so did Democrats at the other end of the spectrum, those
who voted for President Reagan in 1984. Two-thirds of them in the
CBS-Times poll, and three-quarters in the ABC-Post poll, said they
would back Dukakis over Bush in November.
   ``What we're seeing here is Dukakis showing an ability to pull
together the Democratic electorate,'' said ABC poll analyst Doug
Muzzio. ``He's bringing Democrats back home from Reagan. And even
though the electorate is bifurcated he's showing an ability to pull
Jackson's supporters to him for November.''
   The Democratic electorate still was divided sharply along racial
lines, with Jackson drawing support from about 95 percent of the
blacks and less than 15 percent of the whites. His share of the
white vote was well under the 20-percent-plus range he reached in
Wisconsin, Connecticut and Vermont.
   Dukakis backers were wary of Jackson. In the CBS-Times poll 59
percent of them viewed Jackson unfavorably, and in the ABC-Post
poll only 24 percent of Dukakis voters said they would support
Jackson as the nominee against Bush. Forty-three percent favored
Bush and 33 percent said they would not vote.
   In another measure, an NBC News exit poll found white Democrats
split on whether Jackson's candidacy was good for the party.
Thirty-six percent said Jackson helped the party by running and 36
percent said he hurt it.
   ``Dukakis has to be very careful about embracing Jackson because
he's got a lot of people who don't like him,'' said I.A. Lewis,
pollster for The Los Angeles Times. ``Dukakis has a tightrope he's
walking here. ... He has to be careful _ not because of the blacks,
but because of his own supporters.''
   Whatever his future problems, pollsters said, Dukakis' newfound
strength was a striking feature of the Pennsylvania vote. The
CBS-Times poll found that 52 percent of his voters said they backed
him strongly, the first time more than half his support was strong.
   While one-fifth of Dukakis voters said they were backing him
chiefly to stop Jackson, that was well down from one-third in the
New York primary last week, the ABC-Post poll said. And it said
Dukakis had moved in for the first time on some of Jackson's issues.
   Dukakis won half the voters who cited the poor and elderly as
their chief concerns, groups that Jackson won strongly in earlier
contests, Muzzio said. Dukakis also edged Jackson among voters who
cited strong leadership and ability to make a change, groups that
Jackson usually won previously.
   ``Dukakis is consolidating his support and it's coalescing. He's
moving into Jackson issues,'' Muzzio said. ``He's making rather
dramatic inroads into issues of concern to what had been Jackson
voters.''
   NBC's poll said 80 percent of Democrats think Dukakis will be
the party's nominee, and even 49 percent of Jackson voters expect
Dukakis to win. In all, roughly three-quarters of Democrats said
they viewed Dukakis favorably.
   ``He's emerging as the consensus candidate,'' Lewis said. ``The
next step is going to be binding the wounds, pulling the party
together and getting it directed against the Republicans.''
   The NBC and CBS-Times polls had a margin of sampling error of 2
points; the ABC-Post poll, 3 points.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-one women were among 28 miners killed in a
gas explosion in a northeast China mine that defied a national
policy banning women from working in mines, the official China
Daily said today.
   The daily said the accident occurred in February at the Qianjin
Mine, a collective operation in Heilongjiang province. Poor
management and inadequate ventilation were blamed for the explosion
at the coal mine.
   It was the first time an accident involving women miners has
been reported, the daily said. Although there is no law banning
women from working in mines, state-run mines have observed a policy
that women should not work underground.
   The paper said smaller collective mines, which have sprung up
recently under China's economic reform policies, have ignored the
policy.

   When horse rustlers rustle in the City of
Steel, they steal steel horses.
   Mary Dower, owner of Dower's Tavern in Pittsburgh's South Side
neighborhood, says thieves stole the tavern's mascot, a 5-by-6-foot
winged horse made of steel.
   The Pegasus, which once graced a Mobil service station, stood
outside the tavern for years until two men in a Chevrolet Blazer
made off with him last week. The horse was anchored by pipes into a
cement foundation.
   ``It infuriates you,'' Mrs. Dower said Monday. ``People would
drop by over the years and ask to buy him, but I never thought
someone would just steal him . ... After all this time together,
I've grown kind of attached to him.''

   A British collector who owns thousands of records
that were stolen from West Berlin's Nazi Document Center has
refused to return the material, the West Berlin Justice Department
said.
   According to department spokesman Volker Kaehne, the
London-based collector said he purchased the documents without
knowing they had been stolen.
   Kaehne, speaking in a telephone interview, said on Tuesday that
West Berlin investigators could not force the collector to return
the documents because of differences between British and West
German law. He did not elaborate.
   Kaehne declined to name the collector, but said he had obtained
``some 2,000 orignals'' that were stolen from the document center,
a U.S.-run facility that houses the world's largest collection of
records from the Nazi era.

   President Roh Tae-woo's party lost its
parliamentary majority in an upset in national elections on Tuesday.
   It was the first time in South Korea's 40-year history that the
governing party has lost its majority in the National Assembly.
   The voting was marred by violent protests. No deaths were
reported but newspapers said three policemen were injured as
demonstrators protested alleged vote rigging in cities throughout
the country.
   Final official returns indicated that 166 candidates from three
opposition parties were assured of seats. Independents won 10
seats, and Roh's Democratic Justice Party won 123 seats, the most
by a single party.
   There are 299 seats in the assembly, but only 224 were up for
election from single-member districts. The other 75 seats are
allotted according to the proportion of votes each party received.
Winners will serve four-year terms.
   The Democratic Justice Party had 160 seats in the outgoing
276-seat assembly, which was expanded in size by a new constitution.
   Roh, who appeared disappointed, said the election ``has left
many things for us to think deeply about, but I would humbly accept
the outcome and do my best to fulfill my promise to the people.''
   Kim Dae-jung's opposition Party for Peace and Democracy defeated
Kim Young-sam's opposition Reunification Democratic Party in the
battle for the No. 2 spot. The Party for Peace won 73 seats,
compared to 58 for Runification.
   The New Democratic Republicans, an opposition party led by Kim
Jong-pil, a former prime minister, won 35 seats in the new assembly.
   Democratic Justice had been expected to maintain its control of
the legislature because of divisions among the opposition parties.
   Opposition control of the assembly will have added impact under
a new constitution that took effect in February, when Roh started a
five-year term after winning office in December balloting with 36
percent of the vote.
   Under the constitution adopted after anti-government
demonstrations last summer, the president no longer can dissolve
the National Assembly.
   Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam split the opposition vote in last
year's presidential elections when both ran as presidential
candidates.
   Many of those taking part in demonstrations Tuesday were
protesting a report a day earlier by a television station that
Democratic Justice candidate Hyun Kyung-dae had won a seat on
southern Cheju Island with 39 percent of the vote.
   The station, part of the MBC network, said the report
accidentally went on the air during a rehearsal for Tuesday's
election coverage.
   The station apologized to the nation and said two employees had
been fired and four suspended. Prosecutors said they were
investigating to determine if election laws had been violated.
   Opposition parties claimed the broadcast showed that the
government had manipuated vote-counting computers before any
ballots were cast.
   In the actual count Tuesday, Hyun led at first but then trailed.
   Cheju news reports said an estimated 1,000 people demonstrated
after the polls closed, shouting ``Nullify the elections!''
   Yonhap said that earlier in the day, 600 protesters attacked a
polling station and then used firebombs in an attack on a mobile
broadcasting unit of KBS, which temporarily went off the air in
Cheju.
   The agency said three policemen were injured and a police van
was burned as riot squads fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
   There were these reports of violent protests in other cities:
   About 300 students staged hit-and-run protests in downtown
Seoul. Several hundred students battled police near Seoul's Yonsei
University.
   In Kwangju, Kim Dae-jung's southern political base, an estimated
1,500 students jeered police guarding polling stations. In neary
Mockpo, about 500 people crowded the downtown streets in an
anti-government protest.
   News reports said the demonstrations had subsided by midnight.
   Two election-related deaths were reported.
   Lee Kwang-ho, a 21-year-old campaigner for the Reunification
Democratic Party, killed himself by pouring gasoline over his body
and lighting it during an argument with supporters of Roh's party
in the southern city of Woekwan.
   On Friday, a district official perished during a scuffle with a
fellow Democratic Justice Party supporter.
   Korean newspapers reported two opposition campaigners were in
critical condition after being stabbed near their party office by
unknown assailants in Hwasoon, another southern city.
   Officials estimated that 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million
registered voters cast ballots, down from 89.2 percent in the
December presidential election.
   It was the lowest turnout since 72.1 percent voted in National
Assembly elections in 1963.

<TEXT>
   He's a loudmouthed, whining pitchman in his
television commercials, but auto dealer ``Jolly John'' Pulsifer has
bigger plans than just sending you home in a creampuff.
   Having parlayed $2,000 and a memorable television persona into
the area's fastest-growing auto dealership network, Pulsifer is
planning a chain of 20 or more dealerships stretching from Bangor
to Bucharest. Romania, that is.
   Pulsifer's flailing arms, elastic face and loud, nasal whine _
and such trademark lines as ``you're gonna love it'' and ``I'm not
jolly unless you're happy'' _ have made him a familiar figure on TV
screens across southern Maine.
   His local dealerships, however, are just part of a long-term
plan to expand throughout the region and beyond.
   ``We will be the largest megadealer, or chain operator, in New
England'' as early as this year, Pulsifer says, projecting his
sales could grow to between $120 million and $150 million in 1988
from $80 million in 1987.
   The 51-year-old Portland native, who worked for a half-dozen
dealers during a 20-year career as a car salesman, opened his own
used car business in 1979 with $2,000 in severance pay from his
last employer.
   He opened his first new car dealership six years ago in this
southern Maine city of 14,000, taking over a faltering Ford
franchise during the depths of the last recession.
   In 1985, he added a Lincoln-Mercury dealership and a used car
outlet and in the past few months has bought a Subaru and
Volkswagen dealership and opened a 25,000-square-foot truck center.
   Pulsifer says his six Saco dealerships, which sold roughly 9,000
new and used cars last year, attract customers from a 100-mile
radius, many of them in response to his radio and TV ads.
   ``Not everybody is going to be willing to hold themselves up to
ridicule. But, hey, why take yourself that seriously? I mean,
that's stupid,'' he said in an interview, his voice rising in pitch
as he warmed to the subject.
   ``I mean, am I a nuclear physicist? No! I'm just a car
salesman.''
   Jolly John has announced plans for the region's first auto mall,
a $15 million to $20 million, 24.5-acre complex housing seven
dealerships, a restaurant, a 400-seat auditorium and a six-story
headquarters building here.
   He also is negotiating to acquire existing dealerships in the
Portland and Bangor markets and operate them under the Jolly John
name, the first in a regional chain he plans to extend into New
Hampshire.
   The growth of Pulsifer's businesses mirrors what analysts call a
nationwide trend toward auto dealership consolidation as the profit
margin shrinks on cars, cramping the smaller, single-line dealer.
   ``It's really forcing those smaller dealers to take other
cost-cutting measures, and part of that is selling out to a
megadealer who can do it a whole lot easier,'' says Jean
Pellegrino, administrator of dealer services for J.D. Power
Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   Although goofy ads and free Jolly John masks at his dealerships
have drawn buyers in Maine, Pulsifer will tone down his marketing
style for a Jolly John Ford dealership he plans to open in downtown
Bucharest in the next year or so.
   He is negotiating that deal through his participation in a joint
venture with the communist government to import a four-wheel-drive
utility vehicle known as the Aro. Pulsifer, a member of a
Maine-based group involved in the Aro project, has been named U.S.
distributor for the vehicle.
   The Bucharest dealership will use the Jolly John name but steer
clear of his personalized pitchman image. Instead, Pulsifer will
team up with the Romanian national soccer team, serving as a team
sponsor and erecting billboards in its home stadium.

   The U.S. Geological Survey has scrapped
plans to detonate tons of explosives on the bottom of an alkaline
lake in southeastern Oregon after learning Indian artifacts might
be damaged.
   The blast, originally scheduled for Friday in Lake Abert, was
intended to coincide with weekend detonations by American and
Soviet scientists calibrating instruments to detect underground
nuclear tests.
   The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Lakeview was ready to
permit the detonation when the State Historic Preservation Office
notified it that there were ancient Indian village sites under the
lake dating back 5,000 years.
   Leland Gilsen, archaeologist for the preservation office, said
the lake had fresh water thousands of years ago, and people hunted
giant bison, mastodon, camels and early horses near it.

<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential front-runner Michael
Dukakis, another landslide behind him, will now turn his campaign
to a two-track strategy of running in primaries while focusing
attention on his general election battle against George Bush.
   He intends to spend some time campaigning in Texas during May,
even though the primary was held there in March. The state will be
a critical one to his election chances in the fall.
   And he is considering a commencement address at a predominantly
black college as a way of beginning to expand his meager support
among Jesse Jackson's black constituency, whose voters he needs to
be elected in the fall.
   A trip or two to Washington is also likely next month so Dukakis
can be seen conferring with Democratic leaders of Congress, just as
Vice President George Bush intends to summon Republican experts to
his home in Kennebunkport, Maine during June.
   Bush has been running this sort of two-in-one campaign ever
since he routed his Republican rivals more than a month ago. By
winning the final few delegates needed to mathematically clinch his
own nomination, he is free to pick up President Reagan's formal
blessing _ the most coveted Republican endorsement of all.
   Even before the votes were counted in Pennsylvania Tuesday
night, Bush had begun stirring his anti-Democratic rhetoric with an
anti-Dukakis elixir. The vice president said the Democratic
front-runner lacks foreign policy experience.
   ``That will be a major issue in the fall,'' said the former CIA
director, U.N. ambassador and head of the U.S. delegation to the
People's Republic of China.
   He added, in an interview with the Washington Post, ``The
country does not want to move left. They do not want to go back to
the malaise days of Jimmy Carter.'' So long as it works,
Republicans enjoy trotting out the former president as a campaign
whipping boy. Never mind that Dukakis has no known relationship to
Carter.
   Bush's campaign manager Lee Atwater, more pungent than his boss,
summarizes the Republican campaign message with a single
well-turned phrase. Americans, he says, don't want a
``Northern-fried Jimmy Carter.''
   Dukakis, whose caution is legendary, publicly resists any
attempt by Bush or anyone else to portray him as what he is _ the
prohibitive favorite to gain the Democratic nomination. Most
probably on the first ballot at a unified convention.
   In the hour of his Pennsylvania landslide _ more lopsided than
the one accorded him at home in the Massachusetts primary _ he
pointed out that Walter Mondale stumbled four years ago after
winning primaries in New York and Pennsylvania.
   But for all the public disclaimers, he and his aides have begun
to pencil in a schedule for the month of May designed to appeal to
a nationwide audience rather than a single-state primary
constituency.
   In an Associated Press interview last week, he worked to blunt
Bush's foreign policy offensive by resurrecting last winter's
rhetoric about a ``failed and illegal'' Reagan administration
policy in Central America, as well as criticizing the Iran-Contra
affair and policy in South Africa.
   The Massachusetts governor also is expected to speaking about
education and the environment, two areas in which Bush has sought
gingerly to set himself apart from the Reagan record.
   Dukakis also intends to begin fundraising for the Democratic
party nationally and the state parties in the coming weeks.
   Dukakis begins that phase of his campaign after next week's
primaries.
   He intends to divide his time this coming week between the
statehouse office in Boston and upcoming primary states Ohio and
Indiana. His aim is to avoid a surprising defeat next Tuesday that
would raise fresh doubts about his candidacy just as Democratic
party leaders begin climbing aboard the bandwagon.
   In the process, he also hopes to roll up a lead of several
hundred Democratic National Convention over Jackson, thus paving
the way for amassing a nominating majority by the time the
primaries end in California and New Jersey on June 7.
   Jackson is conceded his victory in the District of Columbia next
week, but the Dukakis campaign expects it to be the last contest
the Massachusetts governor loses.
   After the three primaries next Tuesday, the election calendar
offers a natural break before the finale June 7. Dukakis intends to
campaign in May primary states such as Nebraska, West Virginia and
Oregon, but not with the intensity that marked his efforts in the
states thus far.
   Instead, he will turn his attention to amassing the support of
party leaders who will be delegates at the Democratic National
Convention and who hold the votes needed to assure his nomination.
Delegates backing the suspended candidacies of Sens. Paul Simon and
Albert Gore Jr. will also be targets.

<HEAD>Nashville Mayor Goes Undercover To Buy Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Bill Boner donned a fake beard,
dark glasses, blue jeans and a bullet-proof vest to cruise the
streets and buy illegal drugs from dealers peddling their wares a
few miles from his home.
   ``I had no idea how accessible drugs were in our community,''
Boner said Tuesday. ``The two areas where we made the buys are less
than two or three miles from where I live.''
   Boner, 43, said the pushers who sold him cocaine and Dilaudid,
an injectable painkiller, are still at large. ``If they (police)
can go back and find them, they will be arrested,'' Boner said.
   The mayor said he sought out the pushers as part of an
undercover police operation, and promised to do so again to focus
attention on Nashville's problems. The city needs to do more, he
said.
   ``We have willing buyers, anxious sellers who will chase a car
down a busy street waving drugs in the air, and too few police
officers,'' he said.
   During the three hours he was undercover last Friday, Boner
bought the drugs with the help of a pair of police informants,
while undercover officers in vans videotaped the deals and listened
through an electronic bugging system.
   The two informants, a man and a woman in their 20s, rode with
him. They were told he was an undercover police officer trying to
learn the ropes.
   ``Going undercover is not really part of the game plan, but it
has already brought me to a higher level of understanding about the
drug culture and how we can combat the problem of street sales to
people who buy drugs like families driving up for hamburgers at a
drive-in restaurant,'' Boner said.
   Assistant Police Chief John Ross said undercover officers were
close by at all times to protect the mayor.
   ``But we were relieved when it was over,'' Ross said. ``These
people can be very dangerous. We've had a number of shootings and
stabbings in these areas.''
   It was not the first time Boner has disguised himself to learn
more about the city's problems.
   In June 1984, Boner, then a congressman, went unshaven for a
week and spent two days and nights among the homeless to learn
about their plight. He ate at the Union Rescue Mission, slept in a
parking lot and talked to street people.
   Boner said no one recognized him then. Apparently, no one
recognized the mayor Friday, either.
   But Boner said at one point, one of the informants said, ``I
hope you don't mind me asking, but is that a real beard?''

   Country singer Randy Travis won five
categories, including favorite entertainer and top male vocalist at
the fan-voted Viewers' Choice Awards.
   Travis won every eligible category Tuesday night, while Reba
McEntire was voted favorite female singer by viewers of The
Nashville Network.
   Travis, 28, also won for album of the year, top video and No. 1
song. His winning album was ``Always and Forever'' and the video
and the song were ``Forever and Ever, Amen.'' He shared the song
honor with the co-writers, Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz.
   ``All of this, to be in the music business, takes a little
talent and a lot of other things to work,'' Travis said. ``I
appreciate this a lot.''
   His albums ``Always and Forever'' and ``Storms of Life'' have
sold more than 1 million copies each. He received a Grammy Award in
February for the single ``Always and Forever'' and won three awards
in March from the Academy of Country Music.
   His awards Tuesday night were announced during a live, 90-minute
show broadcast from the Grand Ole Opry House by TNN, a 5-year-old
cable channel that reaches 40 million households.
   Miss McEntire repeated her honor that she was won at other
awards shows since the mid-1980s.
   ``I guess this is your way of saying that we're doing a little
bit something right,'' she said.
   The Oak Ridge Boys were voted favorite group, earning their
first award in years by outpolling perennial winners Alabama and
the Judds.
   ``We've been letting Alabama get all our awards lately,'' Duane
Allen of the quartet said, referring to the four-piece vocal band.
   Ricky Van Shelton won favorite newcomer on the basis of his No.
1 album, ``Wild-Eyed Dream.''
   He said afterward that his career goal is ``to have about 25
platinum (million-selling) albums on the wall.''
   Grand Ole Opry humorist Minnie Pearl received a special award
for her half-century of performing.
   ``God has been good to me,'' said Ms. Pearl, 75, whose real name
is Sarah Cannon. ``He gave me Henry (her husband) and he gave me
Minnie Pearl.''
   Some 318,000 TNN viewers chose the winners by telephone voting
between Feb. 8 and April 3.

<HEAD>Austria Files Protest Over Waldheim Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria has formally protested the United
States' refusal to cooperate in a lawsuit brought by Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim against a prominent American Jewish leader,
according to Austrian sources.
   The U.S. representative in Vienna, Michael Habib, was called to
the Austrian Foreign Ministry last week and handed a protest note,
an Austrian official said Tuesday in Washington.
   Austria also sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Austrian government had asked the Justice Department for its
help in questioning Edgar Bronfman, a wealthy businessman and the
head of the World Jewish Congress. Waldheim is suing Bronfman over
his remark last May that the Austrian president was ``part and
parcel of the Nazi killing machine.''
   The United States has barred Waldheim from entering this country
because of his Nazi past as an officer in the German army. A
commission of historians appointed by the Austrian goverment
concluded earlier this year that Waldheim was ``in close
proximity'' to Nazi atrocities in the Balkans and lied about his
actions.
   Explaining its refusal to comply with the Austrian request, the
Justice Department said that because department officials had
developed the U.S. case against Waldheim ``it would be a conflict
of interest and inappropriate'' for them to assist in the libel
suit, spokesman John Russell said.
   Russell said the department had advised Austria to retain a U.S.
lawyer to obtain the sworn depositions it wanted from Bronfman.
   An Austrian Embassy official said Austria views this explanation
as ``not legally based, but rather politically based.''

   Two senators want the Office of Government
Ethics to investigate whether laws were violated when research

   Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio, and Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Tuesday

   A measure sought by the small aircraft

moving to the full Senate after approval by a committee.
   The measure, approved by the Senate Commerce Committee on a

determining liability in an accident involving aircraft that seat
fewer than 20 people and not flying scheduled passenger routes.
   The measure would replace what industry officials and private
plane owners complain is a hodge-podge of conflicting state laws.
   Manufacturers say their insurance costs have multiplied
five-fold since 1981. As a result of that and rising court

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Clears Couple At HHS Of Taking Unauthorized Trips</HEAD>

   A government review panel has cleared a
married couple at the Department of Health and Human Services of
violating federal travel rules or taking unauthorized trips at
government expense.
   The department's ethics review board found the trips by Terry
and Paget Hinch had been authorized and did involve government
business, according to a report in today's Washington Post.
   The panel said Mrs. Hinch apparently had arranged three
legitimate business trips so she could be near her husband at the
resort area of Orlando, Fla., and over Thanksgiving near his
family's home in the San Franciso area.
   The board said the trips raised an ``appearance of impropriety''
and said it had sought and received voluntary reimbursement of
$3,264 for some costs related to the trips.

   Unexpected delays in assembling
Discovery's solid fuel booster rockets probably will hold up the
first post-Challenger shuttle mission at least 10 days beyond the
planned liftoff, NASA says.
   The space agency will not officially make a decision on a new
date until after the assembly process is further along, said Arnold
D. Aldrich, shuttle program director.
   But he said Tuesday at the 25th Space Congress in nearby Cocoa
Beach, ``we're down probably 10 days on the projected Aug. 4 launch
date.''
   Several weeks ago, the National Areonautics and Space
Administration set the date as an internal launch target in
announcing that it planned an August liftoff for Discovery with a
five-man crew.
   As technicians encountered more and more delays in assembling
the first of two booster rockets, officials at the Kennedy Space
Center here unofficially moved the internal date to Aug. 13.
   Aldrich said that it would be later in May before a firm date
could be established, but he expressed confidence Discovery could
be launched sometime in August.
   A faulty booster rocket joint that allowed flames to escape
caused the explosion of Challenger and the deaths of its seven crew
members on Jan. 28, 1986. The three remaining shuttles have been
grounded while the joint and other booster components have
undergone extensive redesign and testing. At the same time,
procedures for assembling the rockets here have become more
complicated as each step is carefully monitored.
   Each of Discovery's two boosters is made of four solid fuel
segments and other components that are shipped here separately from
a Morton Thiokol plant in Utah.
   Assembly of the left booster began here early this month and
stacking of both rockets was to have been completed by this week.
But so far, only three of the segments of the left booster have
been fitted, and extra time built into the schedule for problems
has disappeared.
   ``Stacking those segments is a lot more time consuming than we
thought it would be,'' Aldrich said. ``Everyone as you can imagine
is being very cautious, to make certain they understand all the new
procedures and to check each move.''
   He said the newest projection for completing the booster
assembly is May 22. According to that schedule, he added, Discovery
would be mated to the rockets and an external fuel tank on May 31,
the complete assembly would be transported to the launch pad on
June 9 and a 20-second firing of the shuttle's liquid-fuel main
engines would be conducted on the pad on July 1.
   Leonard Nicholson, manager of shuttle operations at the Johnson
Space Center in Houston, said that if the Discovery launch slips
past Aug. 31, or if the second post-Challenger mission, that of
Atlantis set for Oct. 27, is delayed past Nov. 17, the third
flight, a Discovery Jan. 19 liftoff, would have to be put off
indefinitely.
   Such delays would crowd the launch schedule and make it
impossible to launch Atlantis on April 27 with a Magellan probe to
Venus. There are only a few days in which Venus is in position, and
if that launching is missed, the flight would have to be put off a
year.

<HEAD>Massaging Feet of Opposite Sex Now Legal In El Paso</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City Counci resolved a ticklish problem by
approving an amendment that allows members of one sex to massage
feet of the other.
   The problem came up when Denise Sewell opened the Foot Rub Inn,
figuring that she could turn a buck by rubbing some of this West
Texas city's million feet.
   But she learned that because of a city ordinance regulating
massage parlors and Turkish baths, she could rub women's feet but
not men's without a doctor's prescription.
   The council on Tuesday chopped the ordinance off at the ankles,
making it legal to charge for a massage below that joint.
   The original ordinance, aimed at banning massage parlors with a
penchant for providing illicit pleasures on the side, prohibited a
woman from giving a man a rubdown for pay and vice versa.
   So the council members decided they didn't want to go on record
favoring digital discrimination.
   Not every council member was whole-heartedly in favor of the
amendment, at least not without some clarification.
   ``Well, how far up do feet go?'' asked member Suzie Azar.
   As far as the ankle, and that was all the council removed from
under the city's anti-message parlor ordinance.
   ``I just believe it's good for the body's organs, and just plain
feeling good,'' said Sewell, who charges $15 for a half-hour rub.
``We're all born with gifts, and that happens to be one of mine.
I'm good with my hands.''
   Councilman Ed Elsey says he's all in favor of foot massage.
   ``My wife does it at no charge,'' he said. ``She's the best foot
rubber in the country. Someone who's never participated in foot
rubbing just wouldn't know how relaxing it is.''
   Elsey admitted, however, that he had never discussed his love
for foot rubbing in public before.
   ``I have a lot of conservative people on the East Side, and they
wouldn't understand,'' he said.

<HEAD>With PM-US-Canada, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney is fond of
referring to Canada as America's best friend and ally.
   Yet there's an issue left off his agenda in talks with President
Reagan that raises doubts about the depth of that friendship:
possible U.S. opposition to Canada's acquisition of nuclear-powered
submarines.
   Mulroney's Conservative government announced a major defense
build-up last year, including $8 billion ($6.5 billion U.S.) for
Canada's first fleet of nuclear-powered, but not nuclear-armed,
submarines.
   The plan is to contract for either Britain's Trafalgar-class
submarine or France's smaller Rubis-Amethyste design, but to build
the majority of the 10 to 12 vessels in Canada over the next
quarter of a century.
   The Defense Department is scheduled to make a recommendation by
the end of May. But there's a problem.
   The British vessel contains U.S. nuclear technology and the U.S.
Congress would have to approve its transfer to a third party _ even
when that third party is Canada, a NATO and NORAD partner.
   France, which is not a military member of NATO, has its own
nuclear technology and is willing to share it.
   Canadian officials hint at a preference for the Trafalgar-class
submarine, which is slightly larger and more powerful than the
Rubis and easier to blend into a fleet that works with U.S. and
NATO forces.
   However, Adm. Kinnaird McKee, director of the U.S. Navy's
nuclear propulsion agency, is raising objections to the British
transfer and Sen. John Warner, a former Navy secretary, is among
Capitol Hill politicians who may demand hearings if the sale goes
ahead.
   U.S. nuclear submarines now enjoy unfettered operational access
under the Arctic ice, and the Pentagon hoped Ottawa would opt for
conventional diesel-powered submarines.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in January that
the Reagan administration would cooperate with Canadian plans but
only ``under the right circumstances,'' which he did not define.
   Holding up the British transfer makes Canada a supplicant to its
chief ally, and that has stirred resentment in a country with a
chronic fear of being overwhelmed by its American neighbors.
   Columnist Jeffrey Simpson of the Toronto Globe and Mail asked:
``If the Americans will not trust the Canadians and assist the
British, just whom will they help?'' The paper quoted Rear Adm.
John Anderson, chief of the submarine acquisition program, as
saying: ``It is ironic, one navy thwarting another.''
   During a weekend interview with American correspondents,
including The Associated Press, Mulroney said he did not plan to
discuss the issue with Reagan. ``I don't know Adm. McKee. I never
heard of him in my life,'' he said.
   He revealed, however, that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain had intervened in hopes of securing a lucrative contract
for Vickers shipyard, builders of the Trafalgar-class submarine.
   ``All I know is that Mrs. Thatcher and the United Kingdom have
spoken to the United States and we'll see what happens,'' Mulroney
said.
   Behind the impasse is an emotional dispute over ownership of the
Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic.
   Defense Minister Perrin Beatty opted for costlier
nuclear-powered submarines because they can patrol for long periods
in a vast region now open to intruders.
   Washington contends the Northwest Passage is an international
waterway, but Mulroney says Canada owns it ``lock, stock and
iceberg'' and has the right to control its use.
   The issue flared in 1985 when the U.S. icebreaker Polar Sea
challenged Canadian sovereignty by sailing through the passage,
followed by the appearance of U.S. nuclear submarines around the
North Pole.
   A truce was reached last January when Canada conceded access to
U.S. icebreakers provided they give prior notice before a voyage,
but the sovereignty question was not resolved.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush and Democrat Micheal
Dukakis were running neck-and-neck in a test run of a possible
November presidential election between them, a nationwide poll
released today shows.
   The latest Chicago Sun-Times-Gallup Poll shows Bush favored by
45 percent of all voters and Dukakis by 43 percent. The margin of
error for the poll is plus or minus 3 percentage points, meaning
the two are in a virtual dead heat.
   The poll also showed Jesse Jackson running far worse than
Dukakis when voters were given a choice between him and Bush. Bush,
who has collected enough delegates to assure him of the Republican
nomination, was preferred by 60 percent of the voters given a
choice between him and Jackson, while the Democrat got 25 percent.
   The poll of 1,204 registered voters was conducted April 21-23.

   Ohio backers of Sen. Albert Gore Jr. for

his campaign.
   State Rep. Patrick Sweeney of Cleveland, Gore's co-chairman for
Ohio, announced the decision Tuesday and said he was speaking for

   Sweeney, saying Gore represents the ``left-centrist'' element of
the party, said he and others want to have their views heard at the

   Gore, who suspended his campaign after finishing a distant third

<HEAD>Lt. Governor Predicts Democrats Would Lose Michigan With Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRING LAKE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national Democratic ticket that
includes Jesse Jackson would lose in Michigan and could even cost
the party some congressional seats, Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths says.
   Griffiths told the local League of Women Voters in a speech
Monday night she believes the strongest ticket for the Democrats in
November would be Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Sam
Nunn of Georgia.
   ``Jackson can't be on the ticket, if so, he would lose us some
seats,'' Griffiths said.
   In the March 26 Democratic caucuses in Michigan, Jackson beat
Dukakis by a 2-to-1 margin and captured 76 national convention
delegates to Dukakis' 53.
   Griffiths said, however, that ``by the end of the 1990s or into
the next century we will see both a black and a woman in the White
House.
   ``There will come a time when there will be a black candidate so
experienced and competent that they will not be able to deny him
the presidency,'' Griffiths said.

He joined the AP in Little Rock in 1959 after working on the
Texarkana Gazette and the Austin (Texas) American-Statesman.
   Temple has served as correspondent in St. Louis, chief of bureau
in Helena, Mont., and in Seattle, and as AP sports editor.
   O'Brien, 38, became AP treasurer in 1987. He also is director of
strategic planning. During 15 years in the treasurer's office,
O'Brien had been an accountant, assistant to the treasurer and
budget manager.
   He is a native of New York City, a graduate of Pace University,
and holds a master's degree in business policy from Columbia
University.
   Reid, 36, is director of communications and technology, a
position he took last June after serving as director of broadcast
operations.
   Reid worked at radio stations WJOY and WQCR in Burlington, Vt.,
and as a reporter for the Concord (N.H.) Monitor. He joined the AP
in 1974, serving in Portland, Maine, as Montpelier, Vt.,
correspondent, and as chief of bureau in Charleston, W.Va., and
Hartford, Conn.
   Other AP management officers reelected were James F. Tomlinson,
vice president and secretary; and vice presidents Claude E. Erbsen,
director of world services; James W. Mangan, director of newspaper
membership; and Walter R. Mears, executive editor.
   The AP board of directors met at the annual convention of the
American Newspaper Publishers Association. Two members of the AP
board, Marbut and John F. McGee of the Charleston (W.Va.) Daily
Mail, completed their board service at the Honolulu meeting.
   The cooperative's member newspapers elected Katherine W. Fanning
of the Boston-based Christian Science Monitor and Donald E.
Newhouse of The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., on Monday to succeed
them on the board.
   Reelected to the board were James E. Burgess of the Wisconsin
State Journal in Madison; Robert C. Maynard of The Tribune of
Oakland, Calif.; James H. Ottaway Jr. of The Times Herald-Record in
Middletown, N.Y.; and Edwin L. Heminger of The Courier in Findlay,

   The U.S. dollar closed stronger against the

for the first time in five days in trendless but broad tradings.
   The dollar closed the day's session in Tokyo at 124.99 yen, up
0.42 yen from Tuesday's close. It started the day at 125.07 yen and
stayed in a narrow range of 124.90 yen to 125.13 yen.

<HEAD>Publishers Urged To Hire More Minority Journalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High School Principal Joe Clark urged newspaper
publishers to consider the plight of blacks, shortly after a panel
of experts urged the executives to offer more opportunities to
minority journalists.
   Clark, principal of the primarily black, 3,000-student Eastside
High School in Paterson, N.J., who has been both lauded and
criticized for strict discipline of his students, said President
Reagan has denied opportunity to blacks during his administration.
   But doing so has spurred them to improve their lives, said
Clark, who is black.
   ``Reagan has played a key role in the evolution of black
folks,'' Clark told about 1,500 people gathered here Tuesday for
the 102nd Annual Convention of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   ``What Ronald Reagan did was take the handout away from black
people and make us work for ourselves,'' he said, adding that the
result was massive voter registration by blacks.
   The three-day convention, which ends today, has attracted
attracted newspaper executives representing 90 percent of the daily
newspaper circulation in the United States.
   Clark said the U.S. welfare economy had made blacks unproductive.
   ``We've lost a generation of black folks to drugs, we've lost a
generation to illegitimacy,'' he said.
   The way to reverse the decline is to provide role models, to
bring successful blacks back into the ghettos to provide
inspiration, he said.
   ``Where are the Dwight Goodens of science? Where are the Michael
Jordans of mathematics?'' Clark asked. ``They're out there,'' he
said, but must return regularly to the inner city to encourage
those left behind.
   Clark had a more physical solution for fighting crime.
   ``I think a few lynchings are in order,'' he said, adding that
the drug problem in the Unites States was so severe that sometimes
violence against drug dealers was the only answer.
   Such tough attitudes and his habit of carrying a baseball bat
through the halls of Eastside High have angered civil libertarians
and others who say Clark is all talk and little action. He counters
that he has the support of his students and their best interests in
mind.
   Clark's emotional and loudly applauded speech contrasted sharply
with an earlier, orderly panel discussion on the status of minority
workers.
   But the message was often the same: along with encouragement,
minorities need educational opportunities to help them compete in
the work world.
   Panelist Gerald Adolph, a principal with the New York management
consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., said minorities and
women should be judged on their individual merits, not considered
universal representatives of their race, sex or culture.
   ``Judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to
succeed as individuals,'' he said.
   Adolph, who is black, advised minority applicants not to try to
fit into a white mold, but to ``emphasize our diversity. Try to
find companies that value our diversity.''
   David Lawrence Jr., the publisher and chairman of the Detroit
Free Press, moderated the discussion, which also included Roy
Roberts, General Motors Corp. vice president for personnel
administration and development; Barbara F. Cox, executive director
for human resources at U.S. West Business Resources Inc. of
Englewood, Colo.; and Daisy Chin-Lor, an area director of human
resources for Avon Products Inc.
   Lawrence said newspapers staffed predominantly by white males
risked ignoring the needs of many readers and becoming irrelevant
to them.
   He said a 1986 survey by the American Society of Newspaper
Editors found that nearly 60 percent of newspapers in the United
States employ no minority journalists and that minorities accounted
for less than 7 percent of newsroom professional staffs nationwide.
   ``It's hard for a newsroom full of white, male editors to fake
the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers,''
he said.
   Roberts said the economic survival of businesses, including
newspapers, depended on staff diversity.
   Companies ``that fail to consider minorities in their marketing
strategies ... will be the companies that lose the competitive
race,'' he said.

<HEAD>Canada's Only Socialist Government Defeated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only socialist government in
Canada, the New Democratic Party administration in Manitoba
Province, was resoundingly defeated in a provincial election.
   But Tuesday's vote failed to produce a clear winner.
   With most results tabulated, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
forecast the Progressive Conservative Party would win 25 of the 57
seats in the provincial legislature. The Liberal Party was set to
take 20 seats, while the New Democrats slumped to third place with
just 12 seats.
   The outcome left Conservative leader Gary Filmon, 45, in
position to lead a minority government. But he could be forced
right back into an election campaign unless he can convince the
Liberals or New Democrats to support him on crucial votes.
   Outgoing New Democrat Premier Howard Pawley was forced to call
an early election when his government lost a vote of confidence
last month.
   Pawley chose not to run for re-election and his successor as
party leader, Gary Doer, failed to win much support. Pawley ran
into trouble after approving a 24-percent increase in rates under
the province's government-run auto insurance plan.
   The biggest surprise Tuesday was the 22 percent gain in support
for the Liberal Party, led by Sharon Carstairs.
   The result has national implications. Federal Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative, has to call a national
election within the next year and looked to Manitoba for a
convincing Conservative win.
   Filmon backs Mulroney's two major initiatives: the Free Trade
Agreement with the United States, and the Meech Lake constitutional
accord bringing Quebec into the 1982 constitution as a ``distinct
society'' of French-speakers.
   However, Carstairs and the Liberals oppose both initiatives and
could prevent a minority Conservative government from implementing
their provisions.
   The New Democrats, who have governed Manitoba for 15 of the past
19 years, also oppose the Free Trade Agreement and the Meech Lake
accord.

<TEXT>
   Former City Controller Joseph Vignola,
winner of a four-way race for the Democratic U.S. Senate
nomination, said he's ready to take on John Heitz, the heavily
favored Republican incumbent, in November.
   ``Let's go on with the work, and let's go on to victory in
November,'' Vignola told supporters after claiming victory Tuesday
night.
   Also Tuesday, a follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche won the
Democratic nomination for a congressional race in suburban
Philadelphia.
   Despite backing from the state party and Gov. Robert P. Casey,
Vignola carried only the five-county Philadelphia region, but a
185,000-vote margin in the city offset his losses elsewhere.
   With 95 percent of the precincts reporting unofficial returns,
Vignola had 472,064 or 46 percent; to 349,241, or 34 percent for
Susan Sullivan Kefover, a former Potter County commissioner on her
first bid for statewide office.
   Democrat Steven Douglas of suburban Philadelphia, a follower of
LaRouche, and Villanova University professor John Logue trailed far
behind.
   In a statewide referendum, voters overwhelmingly approved a $300
million bond issue that will trigger a 25-year, $2.5 billion
program to rebuild the state's deteriorating water and sewer
systems.
   In congressional races, only three incumbents were challenged
and all easily won re-election: Austin Murphy of Washington, Peter
Kostmayer of Bucks County and Robert Borski of Philadelphia.
   Murphy won despite being the first congressman in three years to
be disciplined by his U.S. House colleagues. On Dec. 18, he was
reprimanded for hiring a ``no show'' employee, misusing
congressional resources and twice having someone else vote for him
on the House floor.
   In a Philadelphia suburb, LaRouche Democrat Donald Hadley won
the party primary and will face Republican incumbent Richard
Schulze in the fall.
   In the Senate race, Heinz will be seeking his third term and in
previous campaigns raised $5 million. He already has nearly $2
million in his campaign account, to Vignola's $48,000.
   Heinz, 49, heir to the H.J. Heinz food empire, said he would run
hard on his record and his agenda. ``Our job in Pennsylvania is to
move ahead without leaving anyone behind,'' Heinz said.
   Vignola, 38, who served two terms as Philadelphia controller,
refused to be intimidated about the job he faces.
   ``If I were making ketchup, perhaps it would be difficult,'' he
said Tuesday night. ``I'm not making ketchup. I'm running against a
lackluster U.S. senator.''
   He has said he would focus on Heinz's voting record for aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras, the space-based missile-defense system, and
the MX missile, and his opposition to cost-of-living increases in
Social Security.
   Pennsylvania Democrats have not won a Senate election since 1962.

<HEAD>Mozambique Blames Its Civil War On South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Joachim Chissano blamed
South Africa for Mozambique's devastating civil war but sent an
emissary on a goodwill mission to the white-ruled nation, raising
the possibility of a summit meeting.
   Chissano spoke harshly of South Africa at the opening of a
conference convened Tuesday by his Marxist-oriented government and
the United Nations to address Mozambique's emergency relief needs
for the coming year.
   Mozambique says 6 million of its 14.5 million people need
emergency food aid. It has appealed for 900 million tons of donated
food, as well as other assistance, with a total cost of $380
million.
   Mozambique attributes most of its problems to the insurgency
waged since 1977 by the Mozambique National Resistance, which it
says is backed by South Africa in violation of a 1984
non-aggression treaty.
   But as the conference began, Chissano dispatched Cooperation
Minister Jacinto Veloso with a conciliatory message for South
African President P.W. Botha. South Africa's Foreign Ministry said
Veloso met with Botha, conveyed Chissano's interest in improving
relations and discussed a possible summit meeting between the two
leaders.
   The Foriegn Ministry quoted Botha as offering to promote
regional development and saying the two countries should stop
accusing each other of breaching the 1984 non-aggression accord.
   In the treaty, Mozambique and South Africa pledged to halt
assistance to insurgents fighting the other country's government.
   There is widespread international support for Mozambique's claim
that South African security forces continue to provide logistical
aid to the Mozambican rebels despite the treaty.
   The conference in Maputo was attended by about 200 delegates
from U.N. agencies, relief organizations and foreign governments.
   A U.S. delegate, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Roy Stacey,
accused the Mozambican rebels of ``one of the most brutal
holocausts against ordinary human beings since World War II.''
   Stacey said the rebels' supporters, ``wherever they may be,
cannot wash the blood from their hands unless all support for this
unconscionable violence is stopped immediately.'' Without
specifying figures, he said the United States intended to make
Mozambique its largest aid recipient in sub-Saharan Africa.
   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a message to
the conference, said Mozambique ``remains the target of externally
supported acts of destabilization.''
   ``This continued reign of terror has increasingly involved
random and brutal killings, pillaging of the population, wide-scale
destruction and sabotage,'' he said.
   In his speech, Chissano said South Africa was engaged in a
``criminal and irresponsible'' strategy to weaken black-ruled
southern African states.
   He said the rebel movement ``has its command in South Africa,
where it receives all kinds of aid.''
   A Swedish official, Sten Rylander, urged the international
community to provide security assistance, as well as emergency aid,
in order to protect relief projects.
   Despite the strains between Mozambique and South Africa, there
have been signs of increasing cooperation.
   The two governments have engaged in negotiations aimed at
rehabilitating a major hydroelectric project in Mozambique that has
been frequently targeted by rebel saboteurs.
   On Monday, the chairman of South Africa's largest conglomerate
held talks with Chissano and other Mozambican officials in Maputo
on the possible involvement of Anglo American Corp. in developing
Mozambique's natural resources. Anglo's chairman, Gavin Relly, said
his company might be interested in forestry, agriculture and
natural gas projects.

   The American Newspaper Publishers Association
elects officers and directors today and wraps up its 102nd Annual
Convention with a look at issues facing the Asia-Pacific region.
   Scheduled speakers today are Gennady Gerasimov, the chief of the
information department of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs; Admiral Ronald J. Hays, commander in chief of the United
States Pacific Command; and Fredrick F. Chien, a representative of
the Coordination Council for North American Affairs in Taipei,
Taiwan. Juan Bautista Sosa, Panama's Ambassador to the United
States, is also scheduled to speak.
   On Tuesday, the publishers were urged to hire more minorities;
controversial New Jersey high school principal Joseph Clark
delivered an emotional speech on the plight of blacks in America;
and NBC News senior commentator John Chancellor said Jesse Jackson
was not up to the demands of the vice presidency, and did not want
the job anyway.
   ``He's the least vice presidential type of person you ever met
in your life. I mean, you have to work,'' Chancellor said after his
luncheon speech.
   Jackson has said he is a ``tree shaker, not a jelly maker.''
Chancellor said ``vice presidents don't even get to make much jelly
and they never get to shake the tree.''
   Chancellor said Jackson would be wise not to accept the vice
presidential spot, because if the Democrats lose, he would be
blamed. The 46-year-old Jackson is young enough to seek the top
spot in 1996, Chancellor said.
   Assuming Jackson does not get the Democratic presidential
nomination, Chancellor said, America will be left with two
uncharismatic candidates: Republican Vice President George Bush and
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``It looks as though we'll have a grilled cheese sandwich
running against a chocolate milk shake this fall,'' he said.
   Chancellor told the newspaper executives President Reagan's
administration will end in about nine months in ``an orgy of
sentimentality ... a great, gushy farewell to the Gipper.''
   Clark, black principal of Eastside High School in Paterson,
N.J., who has been criticized and lauded for his strict
disciplinary tactics, said Reagan has denied opportunity to blacks
during his administration, but by doing so has spurred them to
improve their lives.
   ``Reagan has played a key role in the evolution of black
folks,'' Clark said, because his record on civil rights and
domestic programs caused a massive voter registration by blacks.
   Clark's emotional and heartily applauded speech followed a panel
discussion on the status of minority workers.
   Panelist Gerald Adolph, a principal with the New York management
consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc., said minorities and
women should be judged on their individual merits, not considered
universal representatives of their race, sex or culture.
   ``Judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to
succeed as individuals,'' he said.
   Adolph, who is black, advised minority applicants not to try to
fit into a white mold, but to ``emphasize our diversity. Try to
find companies that value our diversity.''
   David Lawrence Jr., publisher and chairman of the Detroit Free

predominantly by white males risked ignoring the needs of many
readers and becoming irrelevant to them.
   ``It's hard for a newsroom full of white, male editors to fake
the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers,''
he said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Susan and Martin Tolchin, authors of ``Buying
into America: How Foreign Money is Changing the Face of Our
Nation,'' said foreigners were buying property and businesses all
over the country, without the federal government investigating the
long-term effects.
   ``Foreign investment is happening to us quicker than we can
absorb it,'' Ms. Tolchin said.
   The three-day convention, which ends today, has attracted
newspaper executives representing 90 percent of the daily newspaper
circulation in the United States.
   Outgoing ANPA Chairman George W. Wilson, who is also president
of the Concord (N.H.) Monitor, will preside today over the annual
meeting and elections to the 22-member board.
   Officer nominees are Arthur Ochs Sulzberger of The New York
Times Co. for ANPA chairman; William H. Cowles 3rd, the
Spokesman-Review and Spokane (Wash.) Chronicle, for vice chairman;
Lloyd G. Schermer, Lee Enterprises Inc., Davenport, Iowa, for
secretary; Robert F. Erburu, The Times Mirror Co., Los Angeles, for
treasurer.
   Nominees for re-election to the board are Frank A. Bennack Jr.,
the Hearst Corp., New York; Charles T. Brumback, Chicago Tribune

<TEXT>
   Ohio State University is giving its
business students $5 million to invest in a test of whether
students can outperform the Standard & Poor's index and the
university's regular money managers.
   ``The students will never have their hands on the money or stock
certificates, but they will make the decisions,'' said University
Treasurer James Nichols.
   The performance of the students would be judged against the
performance of the market and that of professional investment
managers, Nichols said.
   ``If, over time, the students don't do well against the market
and the professionals, the program will be terminated,'' he said.
   He said he knew of no other university using such an amount of
money in similar programs. He said other universities involve about
$50,000 in their programs.
   Under the program announced this week, students would act as
investment managers as part of an advanced investments course for
undergraduates. They will be expected to follow the same procedures
as professional investment managers.
   The money would come from the university's endowment, which is
about $245 million. The fund consists of donations and doesn't
include money from state subsidies or student tuition
   Investments probably would be made on the New York Stock
Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, and be consistent with
the university's conservative investment policies, Nichols said.
   ``We are always looking a appreciation on long-term
investments,'' he said. ``We try to steady, and over time, that has
paid off.''
   The course probably will be offered during the fall and winter
quarters the next school year. It is scheduled for a trial run this
summer.
   Stephen Buser, a professor of finance, said the investments
would add a new dimension to education. ``This program will give
students a view of the real world from the classroom,'' he said.
   The program was suggested by OSU Trustee John J. Barone, a
Toledo lawyer.

<TEXT>
   Science fiction writer Clifford Donald Simak,
a retired newspaperman and three-time Hugo award-winner, has died
at age 83.
   Simak died Monday at Riverside Medical Center in Minneapolis.
   He wrote more than two dozen novels, several non-fiction science
books and hundreds of short stories during a 37-year career as
reporter, news editor and science editor for the Minneapolis Star
and the Minneapolis Tribune.
   Among his better-known titles are ``City,'' published in 1952;
``Way Station,'' 1963; ``The Visitors,'' 1979; and ``Skirmish: The
Great Short Fiction of Clifford D. Simak,'' stories published from
1944 to 1975.
   He received three Hugo awards, regarded as the Oscar of science
fiction writing, and three Science Fiction Association of America
Nebula Awards, including the Grand National in recognition of his
entire collection of work.
   He was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 1973.
   Simak was born on a farm in southwestern Wisconsin and attended
the University of Wisconsin for a short time. He taught school for
several years before taking the first of several newspaper jobs in
1929.
   In 1939, he began his career with the Star and the Tribune.
   ``I was in awe of him,'' said Robert Franklin, who was city
editor of the Tribune during part of Simak's tenure. ``Here was a
world-class author who had so much energy that, even in his 70s, he
worked a full shift at the paper and then went home to write.''
   Many science fiction writers wrote of invincible supermen, but
Simak wrote about common people who didn't always win.
   ``I have tried at times to place humans in perspective against
the vastness of universal time and space,'' he once said. ``I have
been concerned with where we, as a race, may be going and what may
be our purpose in the universal scheme _ if we have a purpose.
   ``In general, I believe we do, and perhaps an important one.''
   Simak's wife of 56 years, Agnes, died in 1985. He is survived by
a daughter, a son and a brother.

<HEAD>Storm Dumps Snow on Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm that dumped more than a foot of snow on the northern
Plains swirled across Wisconsin today, while rain fell from North
Carolina to Ohio.
   Rochester, Minn., was buried under 11 inches of snow, with an
inch of snow per hour for four hours Tuesday night. Several cars
slid into ditches in Mason City, Iowa, as 4 inches of snow fell in
just three hours.
   Elsewhere in Minnesota, up to 10 inches of snow fell on Dodge
Center, between 5 and 8 inches fell at Albert Lea and Austin had 4
to 5 inches. In South Dakota, 14 inches fell on Custer, 12 inches
on Bonesteel and Gregory, and 10 inches at Colome.
   ``We'll put up with it because you have to have it when you have
to have moisture,'' Wesley Stinton of Gregory said.
   ``Whenever you get moisture in this country, it makes you feel
pretty good,'' farmer Henry Furhman said.
   Two inches of snow was on the ground at Eau Claire, Wisc., and 3
to 6 inches was forecast today for central Wisconsin.
   Snow advisories continue this morning for southeast Minnesota
and central Wisconsin. A gale warning was issued for Lake Michigan.
   Temperatures were freezing this morning across the northern
Great Plains and forecasters issued freeze advisories for most of
Kansas and northwest Oklahoma.
   A few showers lingered over central Florida. Scattered showers
developed in western Oregon late Tuesday with a thunderstorm at
Eugene.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included .32 inches at Milwaukee, .28 inches at Green Bay, Wisc.,
.27 inches at South Bend, Ind., and .24 inches at Jacksonville, Fla.
   Patchy dense fog covered portions of Georgia this morning,
cutting visibility to an eighth of a mile at Macon and a sixteenth
of a mile at Savannah.
   Light southerly winds and mostly clear skies prevailed along the
middle and north Atlantic coast states.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in southern Florida and from North Carolina across the central
Appalachians to Ohio; light rain in Pennsylvania and western New
York; rain mixed with snow over northern Indiana, lower Michigan,
northern Illinois and eastern Wisconsin; rain across western
Washington and Oregon.
   Highs were expected in the 30s and 40s in the Great Lakes region
and the upper Mississippi Valley; 70s and 80s in the south Atlantic
and Gulf coastal states, most of Texas, New Mexico, the desert
Southwest and California; a few 90s in the desert Southwest.
Elsewhere, highs were expected in the 50s or 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 22
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 80 degrees at Key West Naval
Air Station, Fla.

<HEAD>Daughter: Mom Discussed Many Ways to Kill Her Husband</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of killing her husband and a
woman by putting cyanide in Excedrin capsules had discussed copying
the Chicago-area Tylenol poisonings that killed seven, the
defendant's daughter testified.
   Stella Nickell also failed in an attempt to kill her husband,
Bruce, by putting black seeds she believed were toxic into capsules
and giving them to him with his morning vitamins, her daughter
Cindy Hamilton said Tuesday.
   Hit men were dismissed as too expensive, and putting cocaine in
his iced tea also was abandoned as a possible murder ploy, Ms.
Hamilton told a U.S. District Court jury.
   Prosecutors have portrayed Mrs. Nickell as an unhappy wife in a
marriage beset by financial problems who plotted her husband's
death to gain his insurance benefits and needed a second, random
death to divert suspicion.
   Mrs. Nickell suggested the 1982 Tylenol episode, in which
victims died from capsules laced with cyanide, ``would be very easy
to re-enact,'' safer and less expensive than other means of killing
Nickell, Ms. Hamilton said.
   ``In her (Mrs. Nickell's) own words, it would have been `easy
because they were looking for people shoplifting and taking things
from the store ... not for putting something back,''' Ms. Hamilton
said.
   With tears streaming down her face, Ms. Hamilton said she didn't
warn Nickell, her stepfather, because she didn't think he would
believe her.
   ``I had nothing I could take to him and present him with the
truth,'' she said. ``How do you make your stepfather, who has only
been close to you, real close to you, for four years believe that
his wife of almost 12 years, who is supposed to love him, is going
to kill him. How do you approach somebody with that?''
   Prosecutors contend Mrs. Nickell not only killed her husband but
placed several cyanide-laced Excedrin bottles on shelves of drug
stores near her home. They say Susan Katherine Snow, 40, of
suburban Auburn, died from ingesting capsules from one of those
bottles.
   Tuesday's testimony came in the seventh day of the nation's
first trial of anyone charged with causing death by tampering with
over-the-counter medicine. The Chicago case has not been solved.
   Mrs. Nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in
Extra-Strength Excedrin and Anacin-3 bottles that were recovered in
stores in Auburn and nearby Kent.
   Prosecutors say Mrs. Nickell's plan began to unravel when Ms.
Hamilton challenged her attempt to make the June 1986 deaths of
Nickell, 52, and Ms. Snow, appear to be random murders.
   In other testimony Tuesday, Roger M. Martz, an FBI chemist, said
he found cyanide in capsules in an Excedrin bottle from the Snow
residence, two Excedrin bottles from the Nickell home, one bottle
at a Kent supermarket and in an Anacin-3 bottle from an Auburn drug
store.
   The average cyanide dosage in the capsules was 700 milligrams,
which is lethal, Martz said.
   In each of the tampered capsules he also found green specks that
were identified as Algae Destroyer, a product used to eliminate
algae in fish tanks, Martz testified.
   In testimony last week, a pet store employee said Mrs. Nickell
was a tropical fish enthusiast who bought the product.
   There was no scientific reason for the Algae Destroyer to be
mixed with the cyanide, Martz said.
   Carl E. Collins, an FBI fingerprint specialist, testified that
he found Mrs. Nickell's fingerprints on three library encyclopedias
with references to cyanide and on a library book about poisons.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Both Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose in quiet European trading
this morning after strengthening earlier in Asia, foreign currency
dealers said. Gold prices also rose.
   Dealers said the dollar received some psychological support from
its rise against the Japanese yen, which lost ground on signs the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and seven non-OPEC
producers meeting in Vienna may be able to agree to substantive
production cuts.
   The yen is particularly sensitive to oil-price developments
because of Japan's heavy dependence on oil imports.
   Dealers said the dollar was also buoyed by continued market
uneasiness about developments in the Middle East, particularly
Saudi Arabia's announcement Tuesday night that it was severing ties
with Iran and giving Iranian diplomats one week to leave the
country.
   The market often views the dollar as a ``safe haven'' currency
in times of political tensions.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.42 yen to a closing 124.99 after
breaking through the psychologically important 125 yen level during
trading. Later, in London, it was quoted higher at 125.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6785 West German marks, up from 1.6747
   _1.3895 Swiss francs, up from 1.3860
   _5.6991 French francs, up from 5.6875
   _1.8798 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8765
   _1,246.30 Italian lire, up from 1,244.00
   _1.2285 Canadian dollar, down from 1.2289
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8730, cheaper for
buyers than $1.8760 late Tuesday.
   Gold firmed in moderate trading in London on news of the OPEC
meeting. Higher oil prices are seen as inflationary and often
result in higher gold prices, since gold is seen as a hedge against
inflation.
   At midmorning, London's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $449.10 a troy ounce, little changed from the
opening bid but up from late Tuesday's $447.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $449, up from $448 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.03 to close at a bid $450.97.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.37 a troy
ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.36.

<HEAD>Court Says U.S. Move Against PLO Office Violates U.N. Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A senior United Nations official
predicted Washington would ignore a World Court ruling that said
the United States violated a U.N. treaty by trying to close the
PLO's New York office.
   In an advisory opinion issued Tuesday, the International Court
of Justice, as the court is formally known, ordered the United
States to submit to arbitration in its dispute with the United
Nations over the Palestine Liberation Organization's observer
mission to the United Nations.
   The court is the judicial arm of the United Nations. It has no
enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its
rulings.
   The Reagan administration's dispute with the U.N. arose from
legislation signed into law by the U.S. Congress in December that
classifies the PLO as a ``terrorist organization'' and bars it from
operating on American soil.
   The U.S. government maintains that the anti-terrorist law takes
precedence over any international agreements.
   Carl-August Fleischhauer of West Germany, the U.N.
undersecretary-general for legal affairs, told reporters after
Tuesday's ruling that he doubted the United States would submit to
arbitration.
   ``We want harmonious relations with our host country,''
Fleischhauer said. ``We are ready to go to arbitration. It is now
basically for the United States government to decide what
conclusions it draws from this ruling.''
   ``It is a pleasure to be proved right,'' Fleischhauer's boss,
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said of the ruling
during a press conference in New York.
   Although the court took pains to dodge the question of whether
Washington's attempt to close the PLO office is legal, the ruling
was seen in Vienna as an implicit condemnation of the U.S. effort.
   The court said the U.S. Justice Department's shutdown order
violated the Headquarters Agreement by not submitting the issue to
arbitration first. That 1947 pact between the Truman Administration
and the U.N. guarantees diplomats unimpeded access to U.N.
headquarters in New York.
   ``The United States is bound to respect the obligation to have
recourse to arbitration,'' said the court's 15 judges.
   The Headquarters Agreement mandates independent arbitration of
any disputes arising from it, but the United States has rejected
any such arbitration.
   The opinion marked the second time in two years the court has
ruled against the United States. In the previous case, brought by
Nicaragua, the United States boycotted the proceedings and ignored
the court's order to halt its support for rebels trying to
overthrow the Managua government.
   The PLO was granted permanent observer status by the U.N.
General Assembly in 1974, and its U.N. mission has been operating
ever since out of an office in Manhattan. Its information office in
Washington, D.C., was closed prior to the passage of the
anti-terrorist legislation.
   Early this year, the U.S. government said arbitration of the PLO
mission issue was premature, and noted that the anti-terrorist law
would only come into force on March 22.
   When the PLO refused to comply with U.S. Attorney General Edwin
Meese III's March 22 order to close its New York operation, the
U.S. government filed suit in a New York federal court. That
lawsuit is pending.
   Washington's attempt to close the PLO office has been condemned
by every U.N. member nation except Israel.

<HEAD>Defense Ministers Review NATO's Long-term Nuclear Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NATO defense ministers today opened
a two-day session to review the long-range nuclear arms strategy of
the Western alliance.
   The session involves an assessment of how NATO must adjust its
nuclear arms after a 1983 decision to remove 1,400 nuclear warheads
from Europe and the signing in December of the superpower accord to
scrap hundreds of intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   NATO officials said U.S. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
briefed his counterparts on preparations in the United States and
the Soviet Union for an elaborate, 13-year inspection system to
check compliance with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces, or INF,
treaty.
   Carlucci also gave an update on Moscow's efforts to modernize
its nuclear arms, sources reported.
   Carlucci arrived Tuesday and met with U.S. Gen. John Galvin,
NATO's top military commander in Europe, and NATO Secretary General
Lord Carrington in advance of the ministerial meeting.
   It is the first session of defense ministers since the Dec. 8
signing of the U.S.-Soviet accord to eliminate two classes of
ground-launched nuclear missiles.
   The ministers' meeting comes as hopes have dimmed that an
East-West treaty to cut strategic nuclear arms by 50 percent can be
signed at the May 29-June 2 meeting in Moscow between President
Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in Brussels this
week said it would be ``extremely difficult'' to get a treaty by
the end of May.
   But Shultz said the Reagan administration will keep negotiating
beyond the Moscow summit for a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty that
he said has broad bipartisan support in the United States.
   The ministerial meeting was moved to the NATO headquarters from
Denmark because of a political crisis there over nuclear arms
policy.
   The Danish government was defeated April 14 on a parliamentary
motion demanding visiting warships be told they cannot bring
nuclear arms into Danish ports. NATO officials have complained that
the motion, if implemented, would undermine NATO's defense strategy
for Denmark.
   U.S. and British warships, which would play a key role in
defending Denmark in times of crisis or war, never say if they
carry nuclear arms.
   Britain already has suspended Royal Navy visits to Denmark
because of the crisis, which led the minority center-right
government to call for early elections May 10.
   The defense ministers will review their long-term nuclear arms
planning in light of the goals NATO has set for itself in recent
years, said allied officials.
   NATO has 4,600 nuclear warheads in Europe, 2,400 fewer that it
had in 1983. It studies adjustments to its nuclear deterrent
through arms modernization and redeployment without raising the
number of warheads. The studies deal with developing a new,
short-range Lance ground-to-ground missile, a tactical
air-to-ground missile and improved nuclear artillery shells.
   The idea of modernizing short-range nuclear arms, most of which
are based in West Germany, has stirred opposition there.
   The West German government fears that, as medium-range missiles
disappear under the INF treaty, the improved short-range arms will
make West Germany a more likely target for Soviet attack.
   West Germany prefers short-range nuclear arms talks in tandem
with conventional arms talks, scheduled to start in Vienna this
fall.
   So do its allies. But they, notably the United States and
Britain, say the short-range arms still must be modernized by the
mid-1990s under a decision made in 1983. To meet the deadline, the
U.S. Congress must approve initial funds for the new weapons by
1990.

<TEXT>
   Frederick Douglass Patterson, the
founder of the United Negro College Fund, has died from a heart
attack. He was 86.
   Patterson, president emeritus of the Tuskegee Institute in
Alabama, died Tuesday at his home.
   The fund he headed became the largest independent source of
funds for the private, historically black colleges in the United
States. It provides money for scholarships, staff salaries, library
resources and laboratories.
   The fund, a consortium of black colleges seeking ways to raise
money, was founded in 1943 with an endowment of $765,000. Its
original 27 members served 12,000 students.
   Today the fund has 42 members and aided 45,000 students from an
endowment of $42 million in the fiscal year ending March 31.
   Patterson, named for the black anti-slavery leader Frederick
Douglass, was born in Washington on Oct. 10, 1901. He received a
doctorate in veterinary medicine in 1923 and a master of science
degree in 1927 from Iowa State College. He went on to get a second
doctorate at Cornell University.
   In 1928 he went to work at the Tuskeegee Normal and Industrial
Institute, raising the vocational training school for blacks to
national fame in his 25 years there. He was president from 1935 to
1953.
   President Reagan in 1987 honored him with a Presidential Medal
of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
   He is survived by his wife, Catherine, and a son, Frederick, of
New Rochelle.

   A bomb blast damaged a U.S.
military train en route to West Berlin but no injuries were
reported, the Army said today.
   There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attack.
   Steve Stromvall, spokesman for the U.S. Army in West Berlin,
said the blast occurred late Tuesday night on a remote section of
track between the West German cities of Kassel and Goettingen.
   The explosion shattered windows on the train's locomotive, and
slightly damaged a 6-foot-long section of track, Stromvall said.
   He said the train continued on to Goettingen after a brief halt.
A new locomotive was attached to the train, which then continued to
West Berlin and arrived just 30 minutes behind schedule.
   The train was the military's Berlin duty train, which travels
between Frankfurt and West Berlin each evening carrying mail,
soldiers and their relatives, and supplies for the U.S. military
based in the divided city.
   About 30 people were aboard the three-car train at the time of
the explosion, Stromvall said.
   U.S. Army officials and West German police are investigating the
incident.
   A similar attack on the Berlin duty train was carried out Aug.
31, 1987. No injuries were reported in that incident.

   A Soviet airliner flying in a spring blizzard
crashed into a mountain in Siberia and broke apart, killing 15
passengers and two members of the crew, the Communist Party daily
Pravda reported today.
   It did not say whether there were any survivors. Officials are
investigating the causes of the accident, Pravda said.
   The L-410 twin-turboprop aircraft was flying from Muya, a
settlement in the taiga forest, to the regional center of Bagdarin,
3,000 miles southeast of Moscow, when the crash occurred Tuesday,
Pravda said.
   ``On approach to landing, in conditions of limited visibility
and snow blizzards, the plane crashed into the side of a mountain
and broke apart,'' Pravda said.
   It was the fourth civil air accident involving fatalities in the
Soviet Union this year.
   The L-410, manufactured in Czechoslovakia, has become standard
equipment on internal routes of the Soviet state-run airline
Aeroflot.
   One of its models, the L-410UVP, was the first non-Soviet
aircraft to comply with a set of stringent Aeroflot airworthiness
regulations, including the ability to operate in Siberia's frigid
winter temperatures, according to Jane's All the World's Aircraft
1983-84.

   Police said they captured three of the
six gunmen who held 42 people hostages for a day inside a bank they
were caught robbing in this northwestern coastal city last week.
   Five people were killed and 15 wounded in the botched holdup.
   The three suspects were arrested without incident at dawn
Tuesday at the home of a relative of one suspect, said Arturo
Moreno, commander of the local federal police.
   Moreno identified the three as Mario Valdez Soto, 26, and Ramon
Terrazas Torres of Los Mochis, and Ivan Camarena Acosta, 21, of
Navojoa, Sonora state.
   Terrazas Torres was found seriously wounded and taken to a local
hospital, said Ramiro Guerrero, news editor at the newspaper
Noroeste in the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan.
   The three gunmen still at large included the gang's reported
leader, the government news agency Notimex said. A judicial police
spokesman contacted Tuesday night declined to say whether police
had any leads on their whereabouts.
   At the house where the three suspects were arrested, police said
they found dynamite, two AK-47 assault rifles, ammunition and the
equivalent of $6,100, apparently taken from the bank.
   An alarm alerted police to the robbery at the National Bank of
Mexico branch in Los Mochis, Sinaloa state, on April 20. Los Mochis
is 500 miles south of the Arizona border.
   Police quickly surrounded the bank and a shootout ensued. Police
allowed the gunmen to flee in an armored car the next day in
exchange for the safe release of the hostages.
   In a brief interview with local journalists after their capture,
Camarena Acosta and Valdez Soto said they had planned the bank
robbery for a month by surveying the movements of police and bank
employees.
   They said two of the gunmen posed as bank customers while the
others took up positions inside the building before announcing the
robbery, Guerrero reported.
   Bank robberies and other crimes have increased in Mexico since
the onset of a crippling economic crisis in 1982.
   Sinaloa state is known as a crime center, particularly involving
the illegal drug trade.

<TEXT>
   The United States is airlifting
emergency arms supplies to Afghan Moslem guerrillas to replace
weapons destroyed when a Pakistani ammunition depot exploded this
month, a U.S. official said today.
   ``Measures will be taken or have been taken to make sure that
(an arms shortage) doesn't happen. A major effort to airlift to
compensate (for the loss) is under way,'' the official said.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the airlift was being
done ``on an urgent emergency basis.''
   U.S. and Pakistani officials have been tight-lipped about the
contents of the depot that was destroyed in a gigantic explosion
April 10, showering an estimated 40,000 rockets, grenades and
artillery shells on the Pakistani capital and the neighboring city
of Rawalpindi.
   More than 100 people were killed and nearly 1,300 were wounded,
according to official figures. Hundreds of people reportedly are
still missing.
   About 280 Pakistani and three U.S. military ordnance teams have
worked almost non-stop to destroy unstable, unexploded weapons at
the depot.
   The sound of the explosions set by the teams are still heard
daily in the twin cities, which have a combined population of 5
million.
   Islamabad has promised to make public a report on the blast,
possibly within a week. Officials have hinted the blast may have
been sabotage by Afghan communist agents.
   There has been speculation that a major portion of the ordnance
was earmarked for the guerrillas fighting Afghanistan's communist
government and the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops who back it up.
   Unconfirmed reports said the depot contained a huge stockpile of
sophisticated weapons, including U.S. Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles, which Washington had sent in anticipation of a peace
accord that might include a cutoff of U.S. aid to the guerrillas.
   The United States, Soviet Union, Pakistan and Afghanistan signed
an agreement on April 14 in Geneva.
   The agreement provided for a complete Soviet troop withdrawal
beginning May 15, to be completed within nine months. It left out
the question of continued U.S. support of the guerrillas and Soviet
aid to the Kabul government.
   The U.S. official said there were no plans to cut supplies to
the guerrillas when the pullout begins. He added that even if it
appears Moscow is stopping supplies to Kabul, it will take time to
verify and reciprocate.
   ``You can't close a pipeline on a day-to-day basis,'' the
official said.

   It cost Arizona taxpayers $1.06 million to
remove former Gov. Evan Mecham from office, according to final
figures released by the state Legislature.
   The figure will go higher if the Senate ends up paying about
$200,000 for Mecham's defense lawyers. The Senate has agreed to pay
the fees, but the state attorney general must decide if that is
permissible.
   Excluding fees for the defense lawyers, the Senate's share of
the bill came to $235,649.36. The House, which began investigating
Mecham in October, spent $824,229.28, according to the figures
released Tuesday.
   However, the cost of removing Mecham from office was
considerably less than the cost of holding a recall election,
Secretary of State Jim Shumway said. He said the election, which
was cancelled by the state Supreme Court following Mecham's ouster,
would have cost at least $2 million.

   The Kuwait Airways jumbo jet that was
held for 15 days by Shiite Moslem hijackers took off from Algiers
airport today, one week after the hijackers released their 31
remaining hostages and went free.
   The hijackers killed two Kuwaiti passengers during the ordeal.
Kuwait Ambassador Gasen Boursuli said it took five days for the
Boeing 747 to be cleaned and declared airworthy by Algerian
aviation authorities.
   He said the plane was taken directly to Kuwait to resume regular
service with the airline, which has resumed its service to Far East
destinations.
   The airline suspended its flights to the Far East after the
jumbo jet was hijacked on a flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to
Kuwait with 112 people aboard.
   Boursuli said the plane was dirty inside and most of the seats
were damaged, but a thorough check turned up no serious mechanical
damage.
   Algerian authorities refused to allow Western reporters or
photographers to view the inside the the plane.
   The hijackers forced the aircraft to land in Mashhad, Iran, and
Larnaca, Cyprus _ where they killed the two passengers _ before
coming to Algiers. The hijackers released most of their hostages in
Larnaca and Algiers.
   They negotiated with authorities in Algiers for six days before
releasing their remaining hostages unharmed on April 20.
   Under a secret deal with the eight hijackers, Algerian
authorities then gave them free passage to the country of their
choice. Western intelligence sources said the gunmen returned to
their homes in Lebanon.

   A doctor who teaches at Yale University was
nabbed trying to sneak out of Christie's auction gallery with a
stolen photograph, then attempted to bribe his way out, officials
said.
   Dr. Herbert Suesserman was charged early Tuesday with a count of
bribery, punishable by up to seven years on conviction, and grand
larceny, carrying a maximum possible penalty of four years.
   Authorities said that the 50-year-old doctor, of Woodbridge,
Conn., was seized at Christie's by security people who saw him
trying to sneak a photo into a gallery catalogue under his arm.
   The photo was one of a lot of two by Harry Callahan valued at
$800 to $1,000, said Roberta Maneker, a Christie's executive. The
black and white print, titled ``Eleanor'' and dated 1947-48,
depicts a pensive woman.
   A gallery representative said Christie's had been tipped to
watch Suesserman.
   Police were summoned and, according to their account, Suesserman
offered $2,000 to officers Frank Gray and Perry Kantor as they
drove him from the gallery on Park Avenue to a precinct station
house late Monday.
   Suesserman was quoted as saying: ``Is there any way we can work
this out? I'm a doctor. Is there any way to make this not have
happened?''
   Gray reported the offer and donned a recording device. He
returned to Suesserman, who wrote a check for $2,500 made out to
cash and handed it to Gray, police said.
   Maneker said Suesserman had been in the gallery before.
   ``We were made aware of him by others in the photography
field,'' she said. ``We had been watching him.''
   At Yale, Suesserman was an assistant clinical professor of
obstetrics and gynecology, said Marian Davis-Aimesbury,
administrative assistant to the dean of the medical school.

   A 200-pound black bear that was
captured and then released back to the wild has been killed because
it posed a threat to humans, officials said.
   ``We just couldn't take any chances,'' said Dr. David L. Hunter,
a veterinarian with the state Department of Fish and Game.
   The female bear was killed with a lethal injection of
barbiturates on Tuesday, less than a week after it was given its
freedom about 26 miles north of here.
   ``We tried to find a way of skirting our own rules, but she was
just too much of a human-type bear,'' said Hunter.
   The bear was captured in Cloverdale on April 7 after wandering
into residential areas, where it stole chickens and a duck. It even
visited the home of Mayor John Doble and took a nap under a back
yard deck.
   The bear was shot with a tranquilizer gun as it sat in a tree
where it took refuge from a clapping crowd of police and citizens.
   Hunter said the bear was tranquilized Monday evening near a
public storage area and that an ear tag identified it as the bear
captured in Cloverdale.
   The bear wandered into yards, rummaged through garbage cans and
showed no fear of humans while in the Placerville area, he said.
   ``She never harmed anyone, but at times she showed aggression
toward humans,'' Hunter said. ``If she had come across a little kid
she might have caused some harm.''

<TEXT>
   A congressional subcommittee has begun
investigating alleged corruption, drug trafficking and civil rights
violations in Robeson County, according to a local congressman.
   Rep. Charlie Rose, whose 7th District includes Robeson County,
said he contacted Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, after talking to
constituents.
   ``They (the subcommittee) have told me that at this point they
don't think that a public hearing would be helpful, but they are
gathering information about problems that Robeson County citizens
have had,'' Rose said.
   The Fayetteville Times reported today that a subcommittee staff
member, who spoke on condition he not be named, said he had been
told the March 26 shotgun slaying of Indian activist Julian Pierce
may have been politically motivated.
   Investigators initially called the slaying an ``assassination,''
but later said Pierce's death was apparently the result of a
domestic dispute unrelated to his political campaign.
   Pierce had been a candidate for Superior Court judge and members
of minority groups called for outside investigations.
   One man has been charged with first-degree murder in the
slaying. A second man, for whom a warrant was issued, apparently
committed suicide, authorities said.
   The subcommittee source said the investigation also covers
possible civil rights violations in the deaths of Joyce Sinclair, a
black woman who was found stabbed to death in October 1985; and
Jimmy Earl Cummings, an Indian who was shot to death in November
1986 by Deputy Sheriff Kevin Stone, the son of Sheriff Hubert
Stone. A coroner's jury ruled Cummings' death as either self
defense or an accidental shooting.
   If the allegations about public corruption in connection with
drug trafficking and other matters are substantiated, the source
said, the subcommittee will determine whether to hold public
hearings or turn the information over to the U.S. Justice
Department for possible indictments.
   Many Lumbee Indians and blacks in Robeson County say they've
been discriminated against by white politicians. The county's
population of about 100,000 is 37 percent Indian, 37 percent white
and 26 percent black.

   A Japanese Cabinet minister's claim that his
country was not the aggressor in World War II is ``astonishing and
very regrettable,'' a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
   Seisuke Okuno, Japan's National Land Agency director, said in a
speech Friday that Japan fought in the war ``to protect itself at a
time when the white race had turned Asia into a colony.''
   The remarks drew stern reaction in China. Japan set up the
puppet state of Manchukuo in northeast China and waged war against
Chinese Communist and Nationalist troops from 1937 to 1945.
   ``It's astonishing and very regrettable to us that a minister of
Japan made such discourteous remarks in this regard of historical
facts,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said at a
weekly news briefing.
   ``His remarks will not only hurt the feelings of the Chinese
people and the people of other Asian countries that were subjected
to aggression but will also impair Japan's image in the world,'' Li
said.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, who is to visit China at
the end of the week, said Tuesday in Tokyo that Okuno's remarks
were regrettable and that friendship with China is very important.
   Okuno spoke after he visited the controversial Yasukuni Shinto
Shrine in Tokyo during spring memorial services.
   China and other Asian countries objected when former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and other Japanese leaders visited the
shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, including convicted war
criminals.
   In his speech, Okuno said that China should not try to stop
Japanese leaders from attending the memorial services and said,
``It is a crying shame that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's remarks
shake and disturb all of Japan with such repercussions.''
   Last week, Deng told Masayoshi Ito, a special envoy for Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita of Japan, that he was alarmed by
right-wing militarists in Japan.
   ``Taking them on an individual basis, such things are not so
big, but when grouped together, they then represent a kind of
tendency and a kind of force which could easily sabotage
Sino-Japanese friendship,'' the official Xinhua News Agency on
Tuesday paraphrased Deng as telling Ito, who was in Beijing to
prepare for Takeshita's visit to China in August.

   The co-pilot of a commuter plane that crashed
near Durango in January, claiming nine lives, was not under the
influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident,
authorities say.
   Blood and urine samples taken from the body of Ralph D. Harvey,
42, turned up ``nothing out of the ordinary,'' Alan Pollock of the
National Transportation Safety Board, said Tuesday.
   An earlier toxicology report showed traces of cocaine in the
body of Stephen E. Silver, pilot of Continental Express Flight 2286
that crashed in a snowstorm on Jan. 19.
   Federal authorities had earlier reported that Harvey suffered
bouts with alcoholism in the 1970s and early 1980s, and had failed
to report a 1977 drunken-driving conviction and a 1972
public-intoxication conviction.
   Family and friends said the results were proof that Harvey had
overcome his alcoholism and had abstained from drinking during the
three years before his death.
   ``I'm glad that everyone will know that his toxicology was clean
and that he was an upstanding citizen who did care and help a lot
of people,'' said Rusty Eccher, a friend of Harvey.
   The NTSB also announced Tuesday it would not have a public
hearing into the Durango crash.
   ``An investigator may feel that a hearing won't reveal any new
information,'' Pollock said.
   He did not know when authorities would issue their report on the
Durango crash. Such investigations usually take about one year, he
added.

   Michael Dukakis, on track to the Democratic
nomination after a ``terrific win'' in the Pennsylvania primary,
today responded to George Bush's criticism that he lacks foreign
policy experience, saying ``it's not how much time you spent living
in Washington'' that matters.
   ``I don't know what good experience is when you sit there next
to the president and do nothing while we trade arms to the
Ayatollah (Ruhollah Khomeini) for hostages, when you go to the
Phillipines ... and commend (former President Ferdinand) Marcos for
his commitment to democracy, while you continue to support a failed
and illegal policy in Central America,'' Dukakis said on CBS-TV.
   Bush, who captured enough delegates in the Pennsylvania primary
to clinch the Republican nomination, recently has focused his
attacks on Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee after big wins in
Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania.
   The vice president has charged that the Massachusetts governor
lacks the experience in foreign policy to run the nation.
   Dukakis said, ``It's not how much time you spent living in
Washington that makes the difference. It's your values, it's the
quality of the people you pick, your ability to work with the
Congress and the American people, to shape a foreign policy that
reflects our foreign policy and principles.''
   Dukakis said if he won the nomination, he would debate Bush on
those issues. Bush said today he would ask Dukakis what the
Democrat would do about the hostages and about keeping Persian Gulf
sea lanes open.
   On Tuesday night, Dukakis refused to claim the nomination
although he scored a better than 2-1 win over rival Jesse Jackson
and widened his delegate lead.
   ``I'm in every single primary and I'm going to be campaigning in
every single primary,'' he said.
   ``I want to say thank you to the people of Pennsylvania for a
terrific victory,'' he told reporters.
   The Massachusetts governor would not say he has clinched the
nomination.
   ``Remember, I am someone people are just getting to know,'' he
said.
   But with the major victory, Dukakis faced a new barrage of
questions about his choice for the vice presidential spot. Dukakis
repeated his claim of not worrying about that until the primaries
end June 7.
   However, he talked about potential running mates, saying he
would consider Jackson as well as Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   Nunn, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has
been frequently mentioned as a possible No. 2. Dukakis said that's
possible.
   ``He is certainly somebody who ought to be considered by the
nominee,'' Dukakis said.
   He repeated his stance that Jackson should be considered as a
possible vice presidential choice: ``Sure, I wouldn't rule him
out.''
   CBS News said it talked to Democratic party officials in 46
states for their choice for the second spot on the ticket. A total
of 22 named Nunn and five name Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   Asked if he would give a vice president a Cabinet post _ as some
have suggested for Nunn _ Dukakis did not answer directly.
   `I am someone ... who has always involved my lieutenant governor
actively in my administration and given that person real
responsibility ... and I would expect to do the same (as
president),'' Dukakis said.
   ``The first and most important criterion is that that person can
be a first-rate president if something happens to the president.
... Pick that kind of person and I have no doubt there will be very
important responsibilities,'' he said.
   Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, Dukakis
refused to claim the crown yet, referring to Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale's problems in 1984.
   ``I reminded many of you that Fritz Mondale won New York and
Pennsylvania and then lost a whole string of primaries,'' he
explained.
   ``I'll be campaigning just as hard and just a vigorously'' in
the primaries to come, he said. ``We're going to work very hard to
win every one of them.''

   Voters stunned the governing party in
a national election by stripping it of a parliamentary majority for
the first time in South Korea's 40-year history.
   President Roh Tae-woo, who took office in February, said the big
gains by opposition candidates in Tuesday's National Assembly races
would make it difficult for him to govern.
   Stock prices plunged to record lows after the upset. After
election results were announced, the composite stock price index
fell 24.58 points to 620.1. The previous record drop was 21.69 on
Feb. 26.
   Final returns released today showed that 164 candidates from
three main opposition parties were assured of seats in the
299-member National Assembly. Roh's party won 125 seats,
independents captured nine and one race still was undecided.
Earlier returns, based in part on projections, had 166 opposition
seats and and 123 governing party seats.
   The previous National Assembly had 276 seats _ 160 held by the
governing party and 87 by the three main opposition parties.
   The election was the first test of public confidence in the Roh
government, which in December narrowly won the country's first
direct presidential elections in 16 years.
   Balloting was marred by violent demonstrations that left at
least two people dead. Protesters backing opposition candidates
marched in the streets, battled riot police and accused Roh forces
of vote tampering. Scores of protesters were detained.
   Roh said the election ``has left many things for us to think
deeply about, but I would humbly accept the outcome and do my best
to fulfill my promise to the people.''
   Roh won the presidency with just 36 percent of the vote when the
two main opposition leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam, ran
separately and split the anti-government vote in December.
   Both Kims won seats in the National Assembly on Tuesday.
   Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy emerged as the
strongest opposition force with 70 seats. He said lawmakers should
consider releasing all political prisoners and demand a probe into
the bloody suppression of the 1980 Kwangju protest, in which 200
people died.
   Officials of the governing party said it was considering ways to
absorb or align with ``some independent members or moderate
opposition members.''
   ``Rough sailing is expected in the National Assembly with the
emergence of a strong opposition,'' said Park Sung-bum of the KBS
state television network.
   Under the nation's new constitution, the assembly has an
expanded role in governing. It is now empowered to investigate
state affairs and the president can no longer dissolve it.
   Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democratic Party won 59 seats. The
New Democratic Republican Party, a conservative group headed by
former Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil, controls 35 seats.
   Kim Dae-jung said the results showed that his party is best
qualified to challenge Roh's administration. Kim, 62, was often
imprisoned by past regimes for his political activity.
   But he also promised to cooperate with Roh if he delivers
democratic reforms.
   ``Our party will not be a party always opposed to the government
policy,'' he said.
   Of the 299 assembly seats, 224 were up for election from
single-member districts. The other 75 were allotted according to
the proportion of votes each party received. Assembly members serve
four-year terms.
   Officials estimated 72.6 percent of the 26.2 million registered
voters cast ballots, down from 89.2 percent in the December
presidential election.
   Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil were elected in the direct
voting, while Kim Dae-jung will take a seat in the assembly through
the proportional allotment.
   Democratic Justice Party Secretary-General Shim Myung-bo
expressed shock at the defeat: ``Voting trends based on localism
really hurt us. Regional support is too one-sided and took many
seats away from us.''
   The new assembly's first priority is expected to be an
opposition demand for an investigation of corruption under former
President Chun Doo-hwan. Chun's younger brother, Kyung-hwan, was
recently arrested and charged with embezzling millions of dollars
as head of a semi-official development agency.

<HEAD>Bakkers Criticize IRS For Revoking PTL's Tax-Exempt Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim and Tammy Bakker say salary figures
used by the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of PTL were
exaggerated, and in any case it is not up to the government to set
salaries for ministers.
   ``Grossly inflated figures have been given for our personal
income and then used by the PTL trustee to continue to discredit
us,'' Bakker said in a news release sent from his home in Palm
Springs, Calif.
   The IRS revoked PTL's tax-exempt status Friday and said
contributions to the financially troubled television ministry are
no longer tax deductible. An IRS report in December concluded that
the Bakkers and their aides profited excessively from donations
made to the ministry.
   ``Whether you agree on how much we should or should not have
been paid, never before in history has the federal government set
the salary of a minister of the gospel,'' Bakker said. ``Just as
never to my knowledge has the United States government appointed
the head of a church ministry, as it has now done at PTL.''
   The Bakkers apparently were referring to David Clark, the
court-appointed bankruptcy trustee for PTL.
   ``I could not believe when I heard the trustee say on a recent
PTL telecast that my income alone for 1987 was $2,977,018, when in
fact, Tammy and I together took home $200,554 from PTL that year.
In the last three years, he said we made over $8,000,000, when,
according to our accountant, together we took home an average of
$531,000 per year for those three years _ 1985, 1986 and 1987,''
Bakker said.
   Bakker also disputed the Internal Revenue Service's conclusion
that much of PTL's Heritage USA theme park operations were
commercial, rather than ministerial.
   The Bakkers also repeated that they wanted to return to save the
ministry they founded. They left the ministry following revelations
of a sexual encounter between Jim Bakker and a former church
secretary.
   On April 15, when PTL officials told him they couldn't raise the
$5.7 million needed by May 7 to comply with the bankruptcy
reorganization plan, Judge Rufus Reynolds said, ``It looks like the
end of the road'' for the ministry.
   ``It's definitely a liquidation,'' said Reynolds, the federal
bankruptcy judge who is handling the case. ``It's just a matter of
how orderly a liquidation.''

   When Robert Ellsworth dusted off his Rolodex

   Ellsworth is a longtime friend and adviser to Dole, and like
many other Republican activists, he thought the Senate GOP leader
could surprise the vice president and win the Republican nomination.
   As Republican Party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said this week,
many thought at the outset of the presidential campaign that
``George's support was a mile wide and a quarter-inch deep.''
   Today, Dole has long since dropped out of the race, leaving
former TV evangelist Pat Robertson to offer token resistance in a
few caucus states.
   Today, the nomination belongs to Bush. His victory in Tuesday
night's Pennsylvania primary gave him the delegates to clinch it.
   Ellsworth says Bush had hidden strength in his race for the
White House.
   Bush had been working in the field of Republican politics for
all his adult life, and the field of Reagan politics for eight
years. He put together a smart, sophisticated and well-financed
campaign organization that steered him through some rough
Midwestern waters.
   Republican consultant John Deardourff said Bush had built such a
foundation of support before the 1988 GOP race that it was
impossible for anyone to chip away at it.
   ``When these other people began to go around and look for
help,'' he said, ``they had to build from scratch, Dole in
particular. The word was that Dole's people were having trouble
just making contacts'' with the Republican Party establishment in
the states.
   ``I had people calling me all the time, from all over the
country,'' Ellsworth recalls. `` ... These people knew me well and
said, `Look, your man (Dole) is a good man, but we like Bush.'''
   Former White House political director Mitchell Daniels said Bush
won the GOP contest by ``capitalizing on natural advantages
accumulated over a number of years. He did it with the crucial help
of Gov. (John) Sununu'' in New Hampshire.
   In fact, governors played an instrumental role in Bush's
success. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and Jim Thompson of
Illinois provided crucial, personal support and put their campaign
organizations to work for the vice president.
   Daniels said there has been much talk of Bush's Southern base as
the ``firewall'' protecting the vice president against early
campaign setbacks.
   ``The real fire break was in New Hampshire,'' he said.
   Said GOP consultant Eddie Mahe Jr.: ``The single biggest factor
had to be that his campaign team was capable and was allowed by him
to do long-range comprehensive planning and to then execute the
plans.''
   To hear the Republican establishment talk about it now, there
was little serious doubt about Bush's prospects, despite his
third-place finish in Iowa and an unfocused stump speech that
hampered the early going.
   ``I think a lot of people misjudged George Bush's strength,''
said Fahrenkopf. ``Some in the party said at the outset that
George's support was a mile wide and a quarter-inch deep. It turned
out that his support was a mile deep.''
   Bush's main challenge was to cash in on a quarter-century's
worth of good will as a party organizer (and onetime chairman) and
avoid any critical mistakes, GOP officials and consultants said.
They added that remaining loyal to Reagan helped Bush among most of
the Republican primary voters.
   Because Bush mostly stuck to the script, his rivals _ Dole,
Robertson, Jack Kemp, Pete du Pont and Alexander Haig _ were
virtually doomed from the start, Republican observers say now.
   Bush finished behind both Dole and Robertson in Iowa, a dismal
showing that shook the candidate and his campaign organization. The
vice president would subsequently write off the Iowa performance as
a testimonial to dissatisfaction in the farm belt with Reagan.
   If he would lose Iowa on the Reagan coattails, the polls said he
won in New Hampshire the same way. But he didn't wait for the
Granite State to fall in his lap _ when he got there, Bush sat down
with his advisers and came out with a new campaign look.
   He had a week to recapture the momentum from Dole.
   ``When he came into the state, he had to do well, and when the
vice president got here, he did what he should have done (in
Iowa),'' said Elsie Vartanian, head of the New Hampshire Republican
Party. ``He rolled up his sleeves and went out and campaigned among
the voters.''
   Bush continued the mix-and-mingle campaign style, posing with
voters at their places of work and in a host of settings, well
after winning New Hampshire.
   He altered his strategy in New Hampshire to directly attack Dole
in television advertisements, accusing him of supporting tax
increases.
   Mahe, the GOP consultant, said that Bush delegated authority to
his campaign aides, and that Dole did not. He said that Bush seemed
gracious in defeat, while Dole ``came off as mean and vindictive,''
by accusing the vice president of ``lying about my record.''
   The outburst came during a live TV interview that reminded Super
Tuesday voters that Dole sometimes comes across as mean or angry.
   Bush returned to his basic stump speech for the Super Tuesday
campaign in the Southern and border states. That pitch emphasized
Bush's support for a strong defense, bringing the federal deficit
under control, spreading the cause of democracy around the world
and giving new emphasis to education and the environment.
   Once he'd disposed of Dole and Robertson in South Carolina, Bush
capped the Republican race with a 16-state primary sweep on Super
Tuesday that marked the collapse of Bush's Republican opposition.

<HEAD>Woman Who Kept Boy in Box For Two Years Receives 30-Day Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman has been sentenced to 30 days in
jail after pleading guilty to unlawful imprisonment of her
8-year-old step-grandson, who was kept in a box for two years.
   Retha Skyles, 54, had said she felt she had done nothing wrong
but pleaded guilty in Pierce County Superior Court because she
could see there was enough evidence to convict her. She was
sentenced Tuesday.
   The maximum sentence would have been 90 days in jail, two years'
probation and paying for indefinite counseling for the boy, deputy
prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet said.
   Ms. Corey-Boulet recommended the sentence of 30 days in the
county jail and one year probation that Judge Thomas Swayze Jr.
imposed.
   Letters from fourth grade students were read aloud in court
Tuesday in which; the children said Swayze should impose a sentence
equal to the time the child, the son of Ms. Skyles' stepdaughter,
was confined.
   But Swayze said that although he understood that reaction was
typical of public sentiment in the case, he would stay within the
sentencing guidelines. He said the woman did not pose a criminal
threat and 30 days would be more than enough.
   In a handwritten statement, Ms. Skyles said, ``I restrained him
(the boy) during my sleeping hours in order to keep him from
destroying property. My judgment may not have been proper, but my
judgment as to the amount of restraint seemed proper to me under
the circumstances.''
   She was charged with keeping the boy in a playhouse-sized box
from May 1, 1985, to May 1, 1987, allowing him out only to defecate
or attend church. The box often was locked and contained a jar in
which the boy was expected to urinate, the charges said. The boy
was not allowed to attend school.
   An anonymous referral tipped off state Child Protective Services
workers on April 29, 1987, and they took the boy and his
11-year-old sister into custody.
   When the boy was removed from the home, he had a severe case of
head lice and said he was surprised to learn that all little boys
weren't kept in boxes, a court affidavit said.
   The children are living with foster parents, state officials
said.
   One of Ms. Skyles' adult sons has said the confinement was a
temporary way to handle the tantrum-prone boy. He said the family
believed the child was brain-damaged because his mother had abused
drugs and wouldn't properly care for him.
   The natural mother, who lives in California, denied she was a
drug abuser. State officials have said there were no plans to
return the children to their mother.

<TEXT>
   The body of a woman missing for five months
has been found encased in concrete in a newspaper building's air
conditioning room, and police have arrested the woman's husband,
police said.
   Workers used pickaxes and sledgehammers to break open a concrete
pedestal for a water purifying unit and found the body of Judy
Sinks, 44, officials said. The pedestal's concrete was poured about
the time the woman disappeared.
   The severely decomposed body was identified through dental
records, Montgomery County Coroner James Davis said.
   No charges were filed immediately against Ted Sinks, 49, who was
taken into custody late Tuesday night, police said. An autopsy
today was expected to determine the cause of death.
   Sinks, who was responsible for heating and air conditioning
systems for Dayton Newspapers Inc., and one other employee were the
only people with keys to the room, company officials said.
   Judy Sinks, who worked in the circulation department, had been
married to Ted Sinks for about two years. The company publishes the
Dayton Daily News.
   Sinks told police he last saw his wife the morning of Nov. 23,
1987, when he went to work, but that she was gone when he returned
that afternoon to take her to a doctor.
   Mrs. Sinks' purse, with credit cards and cash missing, was found
stuffed in a city mailbox the next day, police said. A detective
said then that he suspected foul play.
   A detective who asked not to be identified said police got a
break in the case when one of Ted Sinks' co-workers remembered
helping him bring a barrel to the seventh floor about the time the
pedestal was being built.
   The co-worker, Kenneth Rice, said Sinks had called him at work
on Nov. 20 and asked him to help dispose of a barrel of asbestos.
   The 55-gallon barrel, which Sinks got from work, was sitting in
Sink's garage, Rice said. They loaded the barrel into a truck and
took it to the building. Rice said the barrel had no odor.

<HEAD>Separatists Take 8 More Hostages in New Caledonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melanesian separatists kidnapped a
prosecutor and seven French military policemen who were trying to
negotiate the release of hostages captured last week, officials
said.
   The assistant prosecutor and the gendarmes, who were assigned to
protect him, were taken hostage on the island of Ouvea about 110
miles north of Noumea, the capital of this South Pacific French
territory.
   On Ouvea Friday, separatists killed four police officers and
took 27 others hostage.
   Today's new hostages were confined with the others, who were
being held in caves on the northern side of the island, according
to officials at the High Commissioner's office speaking on
condition of anonymity. The new kidnappings raised the total number
of captives to 23.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, comprise about 43 percent
of the territory's 145,000 people. Many Kanaks favor independence.
   Most of the rest of the population of the territory about 1,000
miles east of Australia _ European settlers, Polynesians and Asians
_ want to remain French.
   Earlier today, one of the remaining 16 hostages from last week's
attack on the police station at Fayaoue, on Ouvea, was released.
Eleven others had been released on Monday.
   Fourteen 14 suspects in the attack were brought before an
investigating magistrate in Noumea, judicial sources said. They
expected charges to be filed but gave no details.
   In Paris, the French government was considering a ban on the
main separatist group, the Kanak Socialist National Liberation
Front, the newspaper France-Soir reported. It was quoting France's
minister for overseas territories, Bernard Pons.
   ``Until now, there has been no reason for taking such a step,''
Pons said. ``The (separatist group) could be considered a component
of the political life of the territory, but current events lead me
to re-examine the question.''
   Scattered violence was reported elsewhere on the archipelago
today.
   Officials said police arrested 11 people in the village of St.
Louis, about 13 miles from Noumea, after an exchange of gunfire.
   Police and separatists traded gunfire near Canala on the east
coast of the main island. No injuries were reported.

<HEAD>Youth Reportedly Inspired by Kuwaiti Hijacking Holds Classmates
Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN GABRIEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager reportedly inspired by
the recent Kuwaiti airliner hijacking took a semi-automatic rifle
to school and held 70 students hostage before he was overpowered by
classmates.
   Two shots were fired, police said, but no one was hurt during
the ordeal, which lasted more than a half hour Tuesday at San
Gabriel High School, 12 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   Authorities said Jeff Lyne Cox, 18, was being held at the
Alhambra Police Department today for investigation of assault with
a deadly weapon and false imprisonment. Bail was set at $100,000
and an arraignment was scheduled for Thursday, said police
Detective Dennis Hamby.
   Ruben Ortega, identified as the youth who first tackled the
gunman, said he saw his chance when the hostage-taker talked on the
telephone.
   ``I could see people were getting close to him and he wasn't
doing anything ...and he was busy talking on the phone,'' Ortega
said. ``So I just went up to him and brought him down.''
   Cox, a senior at the school, was enrolled in the class held
hostage, Hamby said.
   ``He said he got the idea from the hijacking of the Kuwaiti
airliner and from Stephen King's book `Rage,''' said senior Scott
French, who said Cox was his friend. ``He told us to calm down, and
he said he wanted $1 million in cash tax free.''
   Gunmen who seized a Kuwaiti airliner were allowed to go free
last week after releasing the hostages they held for more than two
weeks. Two hostages were killed during that incident.
   Hamby said the gunman in Tuesday's incident ordered teacher
Julie Rivera to leave the room and fired a shot into the air when
she at first refused. Another shot was discharged when the students
tackled the gunman and disarmed him, the detective said.
   ``It's the same kind of ammunition that we used in Vietnam,''
said Lt. Robert Smith. ``It's just lucky it didn't hit somebody.''
   Students said Cox entered the room saying, ``We have a problem
here,'' then threatened to kill his hostages, beginning with the
ones he did not know. They said he told them to barricade the doors
with desks and cabinets and to put their keys and wallets in a
trash can, and demanded cigarettes and soft drinks.
   At first they thought he was joking, said classmate Jason Burke,
17.
   ``He's a joking-type person and we didn't know if he was serious
or not at first,'' he said.
   But that changed when the shot was fired. ``Then I was scared
like everyone else,'' Burke said.
   At one point school officials called the classroom to say they
would be late in delivering the soft drinks and cigarettes. Cox
allegedly told them a 7-Eleven store was 10 minutes away, adding he
planned to start shooting students in 9 minutes and 40 seconds if
the delivery was late.
   But Burke said Cox told the students, ```I don't have any
intention of killing anyone. I don't think I can do it.'''
   The crisis was not revealed to the school's 3,200 other students
until after Cox's arrest, said school Principal Jack B. Mount.

   Buddhist tribesmen with automatic
rifles raided two settlements near the Indian border and killed 14
Moslems, officials from the area said today.
   The victims of Tuesday night's attack included eight women and
four children, they said. The officials spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   It was the second attack this week blamed on the tribesmen,
known as Chakmas. On Sunday, seven Moslem settlers were killed in a
similar attack in the area.
   In the latest attack, about 40 rebels raided the Bengali
settlements near Matiranga village, just 800 yards from the border
with India, the officials said.
   The Chakmas have been fighting for more than a decade against
government efforts to settle Moslems in their traditional tribal
lands.
   More than 50,000 Chakmas have fled to the adjoining Indian state
of Tripura in recent years to escape the fighting and police
reprisals.
   The Chakmas, who are descendants of the Mongols, say they want
to stop the Moslem settlers to preserve their land, culture and
Buddhist religion.
   The conflict has left at least 4,000 people dead.

   Vietnam said today that Chinese

bordering China.
   The two nations have traded frequent allegations of cross-border
attacks since an early 1979 border war left tens of thousands of
casualties and a legacy of mistrust and bitterness.
   Official Vietnamese radio monitored in Bangkok said the three
victims, two of them civilians, were killed in attacks on April 9
and April 21 in northern Lang Son province.
   Official Chinese media earlier said that the Vietnamese made a
series of attacks last week in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous
region. The attacks were repulsed, and some Vietnamese were killed,
the Xinhua news agency said.
   The two communist states fought a brief clash in the Spratly
islands on March 14. It was the first such clash over the islands,
which both nations claim.

   The chauffeur arrived on schedule in the ninth
inning, ready to take disc jockey Bob Rivers home. And in the 186th
hour of his vigil waiting for a Baltimore Orioles' victory, the
limousine left empty. Again.
   ``OK,'' Rivers sighed, drawing it out as Fred Lynn popped up
Tuesday night to end the 4-2 loss to Minnesota. ``It's business as
usual.'' Which means at least 24 more hours at the WIYY 98 Rock
microphones for him, waiting for a win.
   Rivers will pass the 200-hour mark today, Day Nine. He is 0-8 in
his wait. That is not as bad as the Orioles, burdened by an 0-19
record, one loss short of the American League mark, four away from
the modern major league record and seven away from the all-time
record.
   The only records that interest Rivers are the ones he spins. He
is not in the marathon broadcasting business.
   ``I thought this would go one or two days,'' he said. ``I
wondered if we should even bother with it because I thought it
would be over so quickly. Do you know I haven't driven in a week? I
haven't been out of this building in a week.''
   He catches catnaps during taped music shows but the sleep is
limited. He looks a little worn and yawns frequently, but seems to
have kept his sense of humor.
   ``I stuck my neck out,'' he said, ``and here I am.''
   This exercise in endurance began casually after the 11th
straight Oriole defeat. Rivers and another WIYY DJ were at the game
_ a 1-0 extra-inning loss to Cleveland that ended with the bases
loaded for Baltimore _ when the idea was hatched.
   Once it began stretching beyond a day or two, Rivers became
something of a cult hero. His dentist offered to bring his
equipment to the studio. A nurse visits daily to take Rivers' blood
pressure. He's had massages from chiropractors and calls of support
from among others, Baltimore's mayor, Maryland's governor and
Orioles' General Manager Roland Hemond, who confided that he wasn't
sleeping either.
   ``The element of chance makes it scary,'' Rivers said. ``I don't
know when I can leave.''
   For a while, it seemed like Rivers would escape Tuesday night.
The Orioles led 2-0 going into the bottom of the sixth and Rivers
admited being ``cautiously optimistic.''
   WIYY was playing hopeful selections like ``Tonight's the
Night,'' by Genesis. But when Kent Hrbek and Randy Bush hit home
runs for Minnesota to put the Twins ahead 3-2, Rivers went to
``Ain't Too Proud to Beg,'' by the Rolling Stones.
   ``We're in serious trouble,'' he said grimly.
   And when Hrbek's second homer of the game made it 4-2, he said,
``It looks like we may have to hang out one more night.''
   At least.
   The cramped studio from which he works is festooned with orange
and black balloons, pennants and pictures of happier Oriole times.
The station's staff wears ``Free Bob Rivers'' T-shirts, in Oriole
orange and black, of course.
   Rivers is waiting this thing out in a WIYY, 98 Rock shirt that
happens to be black. He swears it is not because he is mourning
over the woes of the O's.
   ``We will stay here until the Orioles win,'' Rivers said
resolutely.
   Each night, his family visits the studio. When Lynn hit a
leadoff home run Tuesday night, fueling the early hopes, Rivers
missed it. He was busy reading a bedtime story to his two sons,
5-year-old Keith, and Andrew, who is 3.
   Rivers does not buy the theory that this streak can't go on
forever and that the longer the Birds lose, the more likely it is
that they will win.
   ``If you flip a coin 3,000 times and it comes up heads every
time,'' he said, ``the next time you flip, the odds for a tails are
still 50-50.''
   That is not encouraging talk. And at the moment, the DJ needs
all the encouragement he can get.
   Rivers is scheduled to throw out the first pitch when the
Orioles return home Monday. If they keep losing, however, that will
be a problem since he has pledged not to leave the studio without a
win. He has a solution, though.
   ``I'll stand on the roof, toss the ball to a van and they can
drive it to Memorial Stadium,'' he said.

<HEAD>Personal Incomes Up 0.8 Percent in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' personal incomes, propelled by
profit-sharing payments in the auto industry, shot up 0.8 percent
in March, the biggest increase in three months, while consumer
spending posted a healthy advance as well, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.7 percent,
after an even stronger 0.8 percent rise in February.
   The spending and incomes report provided further evidence that
the key consumer sector was continuing to power economic growth
despite the fears that had been raised following the October stock
market collapse.
   In a report Tuesday, the government said consumer spending,
after adjusting for inflation, climbed at an annual rate of 3.8
percent from January through March, providing most of the strength
for overall economic growth of 2.3 percent during the first quarter.
   Today's report said the 0.8 percent increase in incomes in
March, which followed a revised 0.6 percent February gain, was the
biggest monthly improvement since a similar 0.8 percent rise in
December.
   However, much of the strength came from profit-sharing payments
made to autoworkers during the month, which supplied more than half
of the $12.3 billion growth in the key wages category.
   Without the profit-sharing bonuses and shifts in farm subsidy
payments, incomes would have risen 0.2 percent during March.
   In all, personal incomes rose $29.6 billion to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.92 trillion while personal consumption
spending, which includes virtually everything except interest
payments on debt, rose $21.8 billion to an annual rate of $3.19
billion.
   Disposable, or after-tax incomes were up as well, climbing 0.6
percent in March following a 0.8 percent February increase.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, dipped slightly last month to 4.5 percent, compared to 4.7
percent in February.
   The spending advance came in the categories of non-durable goods
and services. Durable goods, items such as cars which are expected
to last at least three years, edged down $300 million during March
after a huge $9.2 billion rise in February.
   But purchases of non-durable goods were up $9.8 billion while
purchases of services, which include housing costs, rose $12.2
billion.

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case told
prosecutors today he would be forced to dismiss the charges against
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and three co-defendants unless key
classified documents are turned over to the defense.
   ``There seems to be an absolute stultification of informal
discovery of key documents in the case, which if are not turned
over will mean the case will have to be dismissed,'' U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said.
   The judge said he wanted both sides to work to ``break a very
serious logjam'' caused by the refusal of government agencies to
release classified documents to the defendants.
   Gesell said he was ``extremely disturbed by the implications''
of a motion filed Tuesday by defendant Albert Hakim, complaining
that independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was trying to limit his
access to the most sensitive documents gathered by the
investigation.
   Under the procedures proposed by Walsh, lawyers for Hakim and
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord would have to obtain
court permission before showing these documents to their clients.
   The proposed restrictions would not apply to the other two
defendants charged with conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North, who was fired as a National Security Council aide, and
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter were privy to
the nation's most closely guarded intelligence and military secrets
before they left the White House in November 1986.
   They presumably saw or generated much of the material being
reviewed by an interagency task force before it is turned over to
the defense.
   But Hakim, an Iranian-born U.S. citizen, never had access to
classified government documents. Secord, his former business
partner, no longer has the security clearances issued when he was a
top-ranking Pentagon official.
   Hakim and Secord brokered the U.S.-Iran arms sales through Swiss
comopanies that also were used to funnel money to the Contras.
   Hakim's attorney, N. Richard Janis, claimed in court papers that
the proposed procedures ``directly contravene'' Gesell's order
granting all the defendants access to classified documents being
compiled by Walsh.
   Gesell ordered Walsh to give the defense 300,000 pages of
classified documents to enable the lawyers to determine if the
material would help their cases.
   The interagency task force is reviewing the documents to
determine what sensitive secrets they contain.
   Between 5 percent and 10 percent of those reviewed thus far
contain information that Walsh does not want to allow Hakim and
Secord to see without court permission, according to court papers.
   Walsh said these documents contain secrets that, if released,
could compromise U.S. intelligence sources, sensitive U.S. military
plans and foreign policy initiatives. Their release might also
jeopardize the lives of hostages being held in the Middle East,
according to court papers.
   Janis said Walsh's attempt to withhold this information from
Hakim and Secord violates Gesell's order.
   ``The pronouncements of this court make it clear that the
government must now give Mr. Hakim access to the information in its
possession or face dismissal of the indictment against Mr. Hakim,''
Janis' brief said.
   At an April 12 hearing, Janis was assured by Gesell that Hakim
would get access to the documents. Even though Hakim never had
security clearances he ``has no less a need than the other
defendants'' to see the material, Janis told Gesell.
   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, secret
documents must be declassified before they can be introduced into
evidence.
   Walsh can't force government agencies such as the CIA or the
National Security Agency to declassify documents he or the defense
wants to use at trial.
   If no acceptable substitute for a document can be found, such as
a summary of facts it would show, the judge could be forced to
dismiss the case.
   The judge also signaled a shift in his plans to examine the
problems caused by the immunized congressional testimony of North,
Hakim and Poindexter.
   ``We are a long way from any resolution of the pre-trial
Kastigar problems,'' Gesell said, referring to the 1972 Supreme
Court ruling that says prosecutors must obtain their evidence
independently from the defendants' immunized testimony.
   North, Poindexter and Hakim contend their Fifth Amendment rights
against self-incrimination would be violated if they are forced to
stand trial because they gave testimony to Congress that inevitably
aided Walsh's investigation.
   Under the Kastigar decision, Walsh must show that his
investigation did not rely on any of the immunized testimony or
leads derived from it.
   Gesell said he wanted to resolve the issue before the trial
begins, saying: ``I have no interest in undertaking a
four-to-six-week trial for no purpose, only to throw it out at the
end.''

   An explosion ripped through the office of Saudi
Arabia's national airline today and injured one guard, witnesses
and officials said.
   The blast occurred less than a day after Saudi Arabia broke
diplomatic relations with Iran. Kuwait often has blamed bomb
attacks inside its territory on Iranian-backed saboteurs.
   The witnesses said the afternoon blast caused serious damage to
the facade of the Saudi office on the ground floor of a building in
downtown Kuwait city.
   Security sources said the injured guard was rushed to the
hospital.
   Police cordoned off the area, which is opposite the Meridien
Hotel. The witnesses said the explosion blasted windows up to the
third floor of the building and damaged adjacent offices belonging
to Cathay Pacific and the Kuwait Tourism and Shipping Corp.
   Kuwait has been the target of several similar explosions over
the past months. A Pan American World Airways sales office was
damaged in an explosion in October.

   Chicago's O'Hare International Airport has
regained the title of world's busiest that it held for many years,
according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   A drop in the number of flights at Hartsfield in the first three
months of the year was responsible, officials said.
   Hartsfield had edged O'Hare in the rankings for the first time
in 1987, when Hartsfield handled an estimated 797,037 flights to
O'Hare's 794,921, according to figures kept by controllers at the
Atlanta airport.
   With 192,211 flights in January, February and March, Hartsfield
fell into the No. 2 position behind Chicago, which logged 196,589
flights in the quarter, according to the FAA.
   That represents a 3 percent decrease in overall traffic at
Hartsfield compared with the same period last year, when the
airport recorded 197,657 flights, according to the FAA.
   O'Hare also had the highest delay rate with 55 delays per 1,000
flights, while Hartsfield had far fewer delays during the first
three months of 1988 compared with last year, FAA figures showed.
   Through March, Hartsfield International recorded 9,393 flight
delays of 15 minutes or more, for a rate of 49 delays per 1,000
flights, compared with a rate of 84 per 1,000 last year, according
to figures reported by the Atlanta Constitution today.
   Much of the reduction apparently is due to Eastern Airlines'
cutting back on flights to Atlanta, although Hartsfield officials
pointed out that the first quarter of 1987 set records that would
be hard to match.
   ``We've had record growth for three years in a row, but it's not
going to continue forever. Even with the decrease, those are still
healthy traffic figures. Maybe we've just hit a plateau,'' said
city Aviation Department spokeswoman Marie Powers.

   Most of the light aircraft
belonging to international aid agencies left Ethiopia today, three
weeks after the government grounded the planes that brought
supplies to the famine-threatened north.
   Four planes under contract to the Geneva-based International
Committee of the Red Cross, two planes used by the United Nations
and one belonging to AirServ, of Redlands, Calif., flew out of
Addis Ababa's Bole International Airport, spokesmen for the groups
said.
   Six were bound for Nairobi, Kenya. One was going to Djibouti,
Ethiopia's northeastern neighbor.
   The planes were used mainly to ferry relief workers around the
rugged terrain of northern Ethiopia. They were recalled to Addis
Ababa, the capital, and grounded by the government under an April 6
order that also expelled foreign relief workers from the provinces
of Eritrea and Tigre.
   The order did not affect a food airlift to Mekelle, the Tigrean
capital, where C-130 cargo planes continue to operate. Two light
planes and a helicopter belonging to AirServ are carrying food and
supplies in Gondar and Wollo, provinces just south of Eritrea and
Tigre.
   Under pressure from rebels who have won major victories this
year, government troops have withdrawn from much of the countryside
and occupy only major towns in Eritrea and Tigre. The government
relief agency, the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, has said
it will feed only people in government-controlled areas.
   The expulsion order has halted relief operations to rebel-held
areas, leaving at least 2 million of 3.2 million people threatened
by starvation without relief food supplies.

<TEXT>
   George Bush challenged Michael Dukakis to
``fire away'' at him on the Iran-Contra affair today and Dukakis
did just that after impressive Pennsylvania victories clinched the
GOP presidential nomination for Bush and gave Democrat Dukakis
another big boost.
   Jesse Jackson, a distant second to Dukakis in Tuesday's
Pennsylvania primary, said today, ``I keep struggling against the
odds and I've always struggled against the odds and succeeded. ...
This campaign will remain alive and will go right down to the
wire.''
   In television interviews, the vice president and the
Massachusetts governor set a combative tone for the summer campaign.
   Dukakis said of Bush's involvement in the Iranian
arms-for-hostages dealing: ``He sat there and did nothing while we
engaged in one of the worst and one of the most misguided
adventures in the history of American foreign policy.''
   Bush said he would ask Dukakis in debate what he would do about
hostages in the Middle East. ``Do you really care when a man like
Buckley is being tortured to death?'' he said he would ask, a
reference to William Buckley, the CIA official who died after being
taken hostage in Lebanon.
   ``Let him fire away,'' Bush said of Dukakis in an interview on
CBS-TV.
   Bush, prodding the Democrats on another sensitive issue, said on
NBC-TV he might pick up substantial support from blacks if they
decide Jackson wasn't given a fair deal by his party.
   ``If he's not treated fairly, a lot of people are going to be
open-minded and if I campaign properly with the way I feel in my
heart about openness and inclusion we might surprise people
there,'' Bush said.
   With the nomination in hand for Bush, President Reagan, free at
last drop his neutrality, was meeting with his vice president today.
   ``I am sure the president will offer his congratulations and
discuss how he can help in the campaign,'' said White House House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Ohio, Indiana and the District of Columbia were the next
battlegrounds, each holding primaries next Tuesday.
   ``He's coming in with a head of steam,'' Ohio Democratic Party
chairman James Ruvolo said of Dukakis. But he also cautioned
against ``Washington insiders trying to end the race before it's
over.''
   ``It certainly looks now as though Governor Dukakis will be the
nominee,'' said John Livengood, the Indiana Democratic Party
chairman.
   Jackson vowed to ``remain positive'' and continue running
through the final primaries on June 7.
   ``You can't finish the race until the race is over,'' he said.
``We need to win this race in November, so I will remain positive.''
   Solid as his lead appeared, Dukakis insisted his race against
Jackson was ``by no means over.''
   ``I'm going to campaign as hard as I can in the primaries
between now and June 7,'' Dukakis said. ``I'm going to campaign in
every single primary.''
   He repeated his assertion that he didn't want to think about a
running mate until after the primary season, although he indicated
he would consider Jackson or Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   Network interviews with voters at polling places found signs of
growing strength for the Massachusetts governor. For the first
time, more than half his supporters said they backed him strongly.
In a reverse of the results in earlier primaries, Dukakis outpolled
Jackson among voters who cited the poor and elderly as their chief
concerns as well as among who cited strong leadership and ability
to make a change.
   ``We're almost getting down to the main event,'' declared Bush,
who got 79 percent of the Pennsylvania popularity vote and also won
more than enough delegates to lock in the 1,139 he needed for a GOP
convention majority.
   With 99 percent in, the Democratic Pennsylvania vote was:
   Dukakis, 1,002,198, or 67 percent.
   Jackson, 409,774, or 28 percent.
   On the Republican side, with 99 percent of the vote in, it was:
   Bush, 686,803, 79 percent.
   Dole, 105,735, 12 percent.
   Robertson, 79,581, 9 percent.
   The GOP delegate count was far slower than the popular vote. By
the Associated Press delegate count, Bush needed to win at least 58
of the 78 delegates at stake to clinch the 1,139 needed to
nominate, and he did early today.
   Dukakis won a separate landslide in the election of Democratic
delegates, taking 163 to Jackson's 14. One was uncommitted. That
brought Dukakis' national delegate total to 1,264, compared to 852
for Jackson. It takes 2,081 to clinch nomination.
   As they needled each other with an eye on the fall campaign,
Bush said Dukakis ``doesn't know much about foreign affairs'' and
declared ``that will be a major issue in the fall.''
   The Massachusetts governor ridiculed Bush on taxes, comparing
the vice president to Gilbert and Sullivan's captain of the H.M.S.
Pinafore, who, after saying, ``I'm never, never sick at sea,''
finally concedes, ``Hardly ever.''
   When Bush announced for president last year he said, ``I'm never
going to raise your taxes. Period.'' But two days later, in an
interview on Cable News Network, the vice president said he might
raise taxes as a last resort.
   Dukakis position on a tax increase has been that ``we've got to
find new revenue. I don't any responsible candidate for the
presidency can rule out new taxes. I can't make that judgment at
the present time.''

   A paralyzed 70-year-old who shot himself in the
heart moments after fatally shooting a 20-year-old woman appeared
in court on a stretcher for the start of his first-degree murder
trial.
   Despite Rafael Marin's condition _ he became a paraplegic when
the bullet he fired also severed his spinal cord _ a judge last
week found him competent to stand trial.
   Attorneys for Marin, who confessed to the shooting, say they
will argue that he was insane at the time.
   ``I think this may be too much for him,'' said assistant public
defender Edith Georgi. ``I worry about the stress of the trial. I
worry about his heart. It's impossible to say.''
   When jury selection began Tuesday, prosecutor Jamie Campbell
asked potential panel members whether the sight would influence
them.
   Marin is accused of killing Marisol Aztiazarian at a Hialeah
restaurant two years ago after an argument. Witnesses say he was
distraught because the woman planned to marry someone else.
   Dade Circuit Judge Henry Oppenborn adjourned court at midday,
since Marin, who lives in a nursing home, can attend for no more
than three hours a day.

   A coalition of veterans' groups has
blocked participation by 10 Soviet students in the town's Memorial
Day parade, saying their presence would be ``inappropriate.''
   The students' participation was proposed by the Traprock Peace
Center in Deerfield, which said it could understand the veterans'
concern.
   ``We don't have any difficulty with the decision,'' said center
spokeswoman Jennifer Shikes. ``A lot of the points brought up were
well taken.''
   The veterans said the students' participation in the May 30
parade would be an affront to veterans of the Vietnam and Korean
wars.
   The students will be in the Greenfield area for American-Soviet
Friendship Week, declared by the Greenfield Board of Selectmen for
May 27-June 1.
   Mark Fitzpatrick, head of the Greenfield Patriotic Societies,
said there were ``no hard feelings ... It's just that ... in Korea
and Vietnam ... Russia supplied our enemies. It was a very
emotional decision, and we felt it was inappropriate for an event
(that) honors veterans.''

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Evacuates Staffers After Reported Iranian Threat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy evacuated four of its
13 American staffers this week because of a threat following a
U.S.-Iran confrontation in the Persian Gulf, a Western source said
today.
   ``We are on the highest state of alert I have ever seen here,''
an embassy staffer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The remaining staffers moved out of their homes and into the
embassy compound on Monday. One brought her Siamese cat, which
wandered in and out of diplomats' offices on the second floor.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
embassy received information that an attack might be planned on the
embassy, which sits across the street from the building housing
Khad, the Afghan special security police.
   He declined to say whether such an attack might be carried out
by Iranians or by Iranian-backed Afghans.
   U.S. embassies in the Middle East have periodically evacuated
staffers since the 1979 Islamic fundamentalist revolution in Iran,
but the source said this threat was aimed specifically at the
embassy in Kabul.
   On April 18, the U.S. Navy attacked Iranian oil platforms and
ships in the Persian Gulf in retaliation for the planting of mine
that damaged an American missile frigate and injured 10 sailors.
The United States blamed Iran for the mining.
   The U.S. Embassy has had a skeleton staff since shortly after
the Soviet Union's 1979 military intervention in Afghanistan to
prop up a communist regime. The Soviet Union is scheduled to start
withdrawing its estimated 115,000 soldiers on May 15.
   The United States and most Western nations withdrew their
ambassadors in 1980 to protest the Soviet intervention. Since then
the U.S. Embassy has been headed by a charge d'affaires, who is
among the staffers remaining.
   Security outside the walls surrounding the embassy grounds is
provided by Afghan paramilitary forces armed with automatic rifles.
A small contingent of U.S. Marines, standard for all American
embassies, is inside the embassy.
   A non-American diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Iran has provided political support to some of the Afghan
Moslem guerrillas fighting President Najib's Soviet-backed regime
but has offered little in the way of money or arms.
   He said Iran was ``so completely obsessed'' by its hatred of
America that it preferred to see the Soviet Union retain influence
in Afghanistan. ``They are so much afraid that American influence
will come back in Afghanistan,'' he said.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church membership was a major concern of both
lay and clerical leaders of the United Methodist church meeting
here today in its quadrennial General Conference.
   Joan Nagle, a lay leader from Murrysville, Pa., said today that
laity must become more involved in the decision-making process. She
said that making a commitment as a disciple means not only agreeing
to principles of Christian faith, but also taking action.
   Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles, in an address to open the
two-week conference Monday, said the church has lost more than 10
percent of its membership over the last 20 years due to
disagreements over church theology.
   The church, the second-largest Protestant denomination in the
United States, is down to about 9.7 million members from nearly 11
million in 1968, Tuell said.
   Tuell told the 966 church delegates that membership in the
United Methodist Church is falling because the denomination's most
notable trait is that ``everyone disagrees with everyone else.''
   Tuell, who is slated next year to become president of the
church's Council of Bishops, said uncertainty over United Methodist
doctrine has been responsible for the decrease in membership.
   ``There is no evangelistic appeal to join a group whose
principal identifying mark is that everyone disagrees with everyone
else,'' Tuell said. ``The time has come to say the last rites over
the notion that the defining characteristic of United Methodist
theology is pluralism.''
   Tuell said he hoped that reports to be heard from three study
commissions during the conference ``can help us in this task of
self-determination.''
   He said the church has seen improvement in the areas of racism
and sexism, but that much remains to be done.
   Nagle, a senior engineer for Westinghouse Electric Corp., was
chosen from four finalists and more than 300 entrants in February
by the National Association of Annual Conference Lay Leaders to
give the laity address.
   ``Discipleship may mean doing for love what we would never dream
of doing for money,'' Nagle said. ``Discipleship means coming early
and staying late; this is upholding by our presence.''
   The delegates _ half laypeople and half clergy _ from America,
Europe, Africa and the Philippines will consider more than 2,650
petitions during the convention, which runs through May 6.
   Among the delegates are 290 women, including more than half the
American lay delegates and 14 percent of the clergy delegates.
   Central issues during the conference are the issues of
homosexuality in the church, genderless names for God and changes
in the church's official hymnal.
   The Commission on the Status and Role of Women is supporting a
proposal that would have church publications substitute the words
``Creator'' for ``Father'' and ``Our Savior'' or ``Redeemer'' for
``His only Son.''
   Other groups are seeking those changes plus a change from ``Holy
Spirit'' to ``Sustainer'' to move United Methodism away from Roman
Catholicism.
   Some church members see a move to tighten the reins on
interpretation of the Scriptures as a reaction to liberalism that
cropped up in the 1960s.

   Pavel Wonka, a leading Czech human rights
activist, has died in prison, an emigre source said today.
   Wonka, 35, died Tuesday, five days after he was sentenced to a
second jail term of five months, said the source. The source, who
runs Palach Press, a London-based newsletter monitoring human
rights in Czechoslovakia, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Another source in Vienna said Wonka was known to be suffering
from some intestinal problems and other ailments but was not
fatally ill. Both Palach Press and the Prague-based Committee for
the Unjustly Persecuted have reported that Wonka and his brother
Jiri were repeatedly beaten in prison.
   Prison authorities did not explain Wonka's death in a telegram
to his family, according to Palach Press.
   Wonka was released Feb. 26 after serving a 21-month prison
sentence and was to be under ``protective surveillance'' for three
years. He was convicted in May 1986 of ``incitement to rebellion''
and ``insulting police in execution of their official duties.''
   Wonka, an auto mechanic by profession, had sought to run for
Parliament as an independent candidate for his hometown in northern
Bohemia. he and his brother had drawn up an election manifesto
criticizing the Czechoslovak Communist regime for disregarding
citizens' rights.
   The emigre source in Vienna on April 13 quoted the Committee for
the Unjustly Prosecuted as saying Wonka was arrested April 5.
   Palach Press said Wonka was sentenced on April 21 to another
five-month jail term on unspecified charges. At the same trial,
Jiri Wonka was sentenced to 12 months in prison.
   The Vienna source, who also spoke on condition he not be
identified, said the second arrest probably resulted from failure
to comply with the regulations of the protective surveillance.
   Under surveillance, Wonka had to register with the police daily
and could not leave his home town without police permission.

   Jesse Jackson promised today to take his
Democratic presidential campaign ``down to the wire'' despite
another big primary loss to nomination front-runner Michael Dukakis.
   ``I keep struggling against the odds and I've always struggled
against the odds and succeeded,'' Jackson said on ABC'TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   ``Our campaign of hope is winning every day; our message is
winning,'' he said. ``We've brought in new people; we've renewed
the hope of many people. So this campaign will remain alive and
will go right down to the wire in California and New Jersey on June
7.''
   Jackson later traveled to Withrow High School, where he walked
into a packed auditorium rocking with cheers from students and
singing by a choir. He gave his familiar talk to the students,
urging them to avoid drugs and excel in school work.
   ``I want to be your next president. I need your help,'' he told
them, getting a standing ovation as he gave a thumbs-up sign.
   Jackson arrived here Tuesday night, turning his attention to
Ohio's primary next Tuesday as Dukakis won Tuesday's Pennsylvania
primary by a wide margin.
   ``The contest will be determined on June 7 in California and New
Jersey,'' Jackson said at a rally Tuesday. ``We have every reason
to be hopeful if we keep winning every urban center. Our coalition
is broad, it is strong, it is deep, and we're inspired to run on.''
   ``We're within striking distance. We're going to run all the
way. We're going to run hard,'' he said.
   ``We have now run 45 races,'' Jackson told cheering supporters.
``We're running neck-and-neck. We're going all the way to
California and New Jersey. ... For those who hold out, I'm a
long-distance runner. It's too close now to turn around.''
   Jackson's national campaign chairman, California Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, was less optimistic. ``It is going to be
difficult, it is clearly going to be difficult,'' Brown told NBC on
Tuesday night. ``I want a winner for the Democrats this time,
whether it's Jackson or Dukakis.''
   Another supporter, Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode, told Jackson
to ``hang in there.''
   ``Go to Ohio, California, New Jersey. Work with the `super
delegates.' Work with Gore and Gephardt and try to put together
enough votes to take the nomination,'' Goode said.
   Jackson said Dukakis has followed his lead in speaking to
students about the dangers of drugs.
   ``People have told me that Dukakis is going into the schools now
talking about drugs. Well, that just ratifies my leadership,'' said
Jackson.
   ``People say you're (Dukakis and Jackson) talking about the same
things. What's the difference? Well, it's butter or margarine. I'm
the real thing,'' Jackson said.
   Amid reports that many Democratic leaders would like to see
Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn on a ticket with Dukakis, Jackson indicated
the conservative senator might not be acceptable. He framed his
comments on terms of a running mate for himself.
   ``Whoever I would have on my ticket would have to have a good
record in civil rights, women's rights, social justice, and a real
pronounced commitment to peace in this world,'' Jackson said.
   Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has voted
against some civil rights legislation and against the Equal Rights
Amendment.

<TEXT>
   A tiny California condor chick that scientists
say represents the salvation of its species pecked a hole in its
eggshell today, officials said.
   Keepers at San Diego Wild Animal Park are keeping a
round-the-clock vigil over the egg, the first produced by captive
California condors under a program started 15 years ago to save the
nearly extinct species, spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   The chick should win its struggle to break out of the the
blue-green shell within the next three days, he said. It began
using its lungs for the first time Sunday when it pushed its beak
into an air pocket at the egg's narrow end.
   The chipping of a small hole in the shell, or pipping, begins a
critical phase in the bird's development, Hanscom said.
   ``We have a remote TV camera on the egg, monitoring it
constantly,'' Hanscom said. ``And every hour the egg is physically
tapped by a keeper to provide the same outside stimulation one
might expect from a natural mother in the nest.''
   If the chick fails to hatch itself by Saturday morning, keepers
and veterinarians will step in and help it get out, Hansom said.
The chick will be hand-raised by keepers using a puppet resembling
an adult condor for feeding.
   The chick is especially susceptible to infection and exhaustion
now that it has broken through the eggshell, Hanscom said.
   The California condor, North America's largest land bird with a
wing span of up to 10 feet, once ranged along the Pacific coast
from Canada to Mexico.
   Only 27 California condors are known to exist today, all in
captivity at the wild animal park and the Los Angeles Zoo, the last
wild bird having been captured last year.
   The fertile egg, laid March 3, was the culmination of an
elaborate courtship dance and mating of a young male designated AC4
and his older mate, UN1. The egg was removed from the park's
``condorminium'' and placed in an incubator.
   Exhaustion from trying to break the shell could kill the chick,
but keepers must allow 72 hours to pass before intervening, Hanscom
said. If they step in too early, they could cause the chick to
bleed to death by rupturing a membrane of blood cells that the
condor needs to absorb, he said.
   ``We don't want to be pessimistic, but we are very anxious at
this time,'' Hanscom said.
   Thirteen of 14 condor eggs taken from nests in the wild have
hatched in captivity, all with human assistance, he said.
   The chick's parents have continued to mate, raising hopes for a
second egg. At the Los Angeles Zoo, two other potential mating
pairs have failed to begin the courtship dance.
   Hanscom said the pairs may not have adjusted to captivity or may
be incompatible.
   ``These birds mate for life and here we are chosing mates
artificially for them,'' he said. ``That might not always take. The
birds may not always decide to follow our magic making.''
   Scientists sought to begin the condor capture-breeding program
during the 1950s but were delayed by opposition by the National
Audubon Society and others.
   The opponents eventually were pacified by assurances that the
condors' natural habitat would be protected and that a wild
population eventually would be re-established.
   Federal and state agencies have joined the multimillion-dollar
effort to regenerate the birds.
   The success of the program won't be known for years, as the
oldest bird hatched in captivity is 5 years old and condors reach
maturity at age 7, Hanscom said.
   The egg's parents were taken from the wild, and the male only
reached maturity last summer. But Hanscom is convinced condors born
in captivity also will produce eggs such as the one now watched
intently.
   ``The chick that hatches from this egg represents the
regeneration of this species,'' he said. ``Captive breeding is
their only hope for survival.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia announced it was
breaking diplomatic relations with Tehran, and the Iranian
government today said the Saudis acted under pressure from the
United States.
   In Kuwait, an explosion ripped through the office of Saudi
Arabia's national airline today and injured one guard, witnesses
and officials said. Kuwait often has blamed bomb attacks inside its
territory on Iranian-backed saboteurs.
   Saudi Arabia said Tuesday it decided to sever its ties with Iran
because of a riot by Iranians in Mecca, a raid on the Saudi Embassy
in Tehran and Iranian attacks on commercial shipping in the Persian
Gulf.
   The government also ordered all Iranian diplomats to leave the
kingdom within a week.
   Tehran Radio, quoting a foreign ministry spokesman, said Saudi
Arabia's ``cooperation with America's conspiracies in the Persian
Gulf and its help for the Zionist regime of Iraq'' was a reason for
cutting ties with Iran.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. Navy attacked Iranian oil platforms
and vessel in retaliation for the planting of a mine that damaged
an American frigate and injured 10 sailors.
   The radio said the Saudi decision also was designed to divert
the attention of Moslems from Saudi ``crimes'' during last year's
pilgrimage to Mecca and its decision to limit the number of Iranian
pilgrims permitted to attend the pilgrimage this July. The report
was monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   In Vienna, Iran's oil minister also blamed the United States.
   ``This (Saudi) decision, in my personal view, was made under the
pressure of the United States,'' Kazempour Ardebili told The
Associated Press. He was in Vienna for a meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The Saudi statement, translated by The Associated Press, said
King Fadh's government had sought to normalize relations, despite
Iranian ``terrorism and subversion.''
   ``But the ... Iranian side ... persisted in perpetrating hostile
practices,'' it said.
   Iranian speedboats attacked a Saudi-owned tanker in the Strait
of Hormuz on Sunday just hours after President Reagan warned Iran
to stay clear of neutral ships. Hormuz is the narrow gateway to the
gulf at the waterway's southern end.
   Reagan's warning to Iran came after the U.S. Navy sank or
disabled six Iranian naval vessels in battles in the Persian Gulf.
The clashes occurred after the Navy destroyed two Iranian offshore
oil facilities to retaliate for a mine explosion in the gulf on
April 14 that damaged a Navy frigate and wounded 10 American
sailors. The United States said Iran sowed the mine.
   Iran, which has been at war with Iraq since September 1980,
routinely raids commercial ships in the gulf to retaliate for Iraqi
attacks on Iranian vessels. Iraq's attacks on ships owned by or
doing business with Iran are aimed at cutting Iran's oil revenues,
which help finance the war.
   Saudi Arabia and most other Arab countries support Iraq in its
war with Iran. Iran is a Moslem nation but its people are Persian,
not Arab.
   Iran and Saudi Arabia have made critical statements about each
other since riots in Mecca on July 31, 1987 in which 275 Iranian
pilgrims were killed and the subsequent looting of the Saudi
Embassy in Tehran. A Saudi diplomat died of injuries suffered in
the embassy raid.
   Saudi officials said 402 Saudis and Iranians were killed in a
stampede after a political demonstration by Iranian pilgrims in
Mecca became violent. Iran said Saudi police caused most casualties
by shooting into the crowd.
   Mecca, birthplace of the prophet Mohammed, and Medina, site of
his tomb, are the holiest places for the world's 850 million
Moslems. They are in a region of western Saudi Arabia called Hijaz
and under the custodianship of the Saudi royal family.
   Following the riots, Iranian leaders called on Moslems to
overthrow the Saudi royal family, seize its vast wealth and strip
it of custodianship of the Islamic shrines. Iranian leaders often
have threatened to export their fundamentalist revolution to Saudi
Arabia and other gulf nations.
   Two weeks ago, Khomeini said 150,000 Iranian pilgrims would
travel to Mecca this year and demonstrate against the United States
and Israel.
   Saudi government officials had said Saudi Arabia would reduce
the number of pilgrims traveling to the holy city this year but
have not given figures. Iran reacted by threatening to boycott the
annual pilgrimage.

<HEAD>Court Clears Way for Reinstating New York Mailman Fired for
Failing to Deliver Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today cleared the way for
the reinstatement of a Postal Service letter carrier from Garden
City, N.Y., fired for failing to deliver more than 3,500 pieces of
mail.
   The court let stand an arbitrator's ruling that Edward Hyde is
entitled to his old job.
   Hyde's case, under study by the nation's highest court since
last December, was dismissed in a one-sentence order.
   The justices, who had been urged by Reagan administration
lawyers to rule that Hyde's reinstatement would be ``contrary to
public policy,'' said they made a mistake when agreeing to review
the case.
   The court, without explanation, dismissed the government's
appeal ``as improvidently granted'' _ automatically upholding a
federal appeals court ruling that, in turn, had upheld the
arbitrator's ruling.
   In a 1987 ruling, the justices unanimously ruled that an
arbitrator's award may be overturned on public policy grounds only
when the award creates an explicit conflict with laws or legal
precedent.
   In that decision, the court stopped short of agreeing with a
union's contention that such court action is justified only when
the award itself violates a law or when it forces an employer to
act illegally.
   The justices also did not say how, if at all, the power of
federal courts to overturn arbitration awards differs from their
power to refuse to enforce contracts on public policy grounds.
   In Hyde's case, Justice Department lawyers had argued that he
should not be reinstated no matter what the standard to be used in
cases involving private employers.
   ``A general policy of deference to arbitral awards cannot
override the need ... to protect the basic public mission of the
Postal Service,'' the government's appeal had argued.
   Police and postal inspectors in 1984 searched Hyde's car and
found more than 3,500 pieces of undelivered mail addressed to
residents on his delivery route. Some of the mail was more than a
year old.
   Hyde pleaded guilty to unlawful delay of the mail and was
sentenced to 18 months probation. The Postal Service fired him.
   The National Association of Letter Carriers filed a grievance
and took the Postal Service to arbitration over Hyde's firing.
   The arbitrator ordered that Hyde be reinstated without back pay
after taking a 60-day medical leave of absence. A condition of
Hyde's probation on his criminal conviction was that he complete a
rehabilitation program for compulsive gamblers.
   Lawyers for Hyde's union said he is now completely rehabilitated.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist previously had postponed the
effect of the appeals court ruling in Hyde's favor _ blocking his
reinstatement until Supreme Court action on the government's appeal.
   Today's order presumably will set aside Rehnquist's order.
   The case is U.S. Postal Service vs. National Association of
Letter Carriers, 87-59.

<TEXT>
   Ten students have been arrested in
connection with at least 47 automobile burglaries, most of them
committed with tools they made in a high school shop class, police
say.
   The arrests were made Tuesday at Metamora Township High School.
No names were released because all 10 _ two girls and eight boys _
were juveniles when the crimes occurred, police said.
   Charges against the teens _ aged 15 to 17 _ include vehicle
burglary and conspiracy to commit vehicle burglary. Police have
linked the group to 47 burglaries: 33 in Peoria and 14 in Tazewell
and Woodford counties.
   ``I guess you could call it a burglary ring,'' said Peoria
Police Capt. Lawrence Burwell. ``Two individuals were making tools
for their friends to gain entry to vehicles.''
   Burwell said the tools made in shop classes resembled
``slim-jims'' used by police to enter locked cars. The tools were
used in most of the burglaries, although some vehicles were entered
by using coat hangers or breaking windows, he said.
   ``They were just driving around and scouting until they saw
something that looked good,'' Burwell said.
   Money, radar detectors and stereo equipment were the most common
things stolen, he said.
   Stephen Eakle, the police officer who coordinated the
investigation, said there is evidence some of the students' parents
may have known about the burglaries and possibly bought some of the
stolen property. However, he said there was not enough evidence to
prosecute them.
   Burwell said the thefts began in late January and the burglary
ring was discovered by police about a month later. Metamora police
finally interrupted a burglary in progress and that arrest led to
the group's arrest, he said.

<TEXT>
   A divorced parent may be held in civil
contempt and jailed for failing to pay child support even if not
proved financially able to do so, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said such a finding of civil
contempt does not violate constitutionally protected due-process
rights.
   But the court said a finding of criminal contempt, sparking a
jail sentence or fine, would be unconstitutional without proof the
parent is able to pay the child support.
   Today's ruling sends back to state courts a California case in
which five justices could not determine whether a divorced father
had been held in civil or criminal contempt for failing to make
child-support payments.
   Philip and Alta Sue Feiock were divorced in Orange County,
Calif., in 1976. As part of the divorce judgment, Feiock was
ordered to pay $225 a month in child support for his three children.
   After he failed to make any payments, a court hearing was held
in 1984 in which he was ordered to make monthly payments of $150. A
second hearing was held in 1985, after Mrs. Feiock complained about
not receiving any child support from her ex-husband.
   In that hearing, state prosecutors proved Feiock's knowledge of
the earlier court order and his failure to comply with it.
   Feiock testified that he had been unable to pay the child
support.
   A state judge ruled that Feiock was in contempt of court and
gave him a 25-day suspended jail sentence. Feiock was placed on
three years probation and ordered to begin making the child-support
payments or be jailed.
   Feiock appealed, and a state appeals court threw out the
contempt citation.
   The state court said the state's child-support law creates an
unconstitutional ``mandatory presumption'' that a parent is able to
make the payments _ thus relieving prosecutors of proving that fact.
   In sending the case back to the California courts, Justice Byron
R. White said the high court is uncertain whether Feiock was cited
for civil or criminal contempt.
   People may be jailed for either form of contempt of court.
   Under civil contempt, which is considered coercive, the jailing
is indefinite and freedom is granted as soon as the offender
complies with the underlying court order.
   Criminal contempt is intended to be punishment, and normally
involves a specific jail term unrelated to compliance with the
court order.
   White said that if Feiock would purge his jail sentence by
making up his missed payments, ``then his proceeding is civil in
nature'' and the state law presumption would not violate
due-process rights.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens joined White's opinion.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and Antonin Scalia voted to reinstate Feiock's contempt
citation, saying his proceeding clearly was civil, not criminal.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Raised the possibility that states may deny unemployment
benefits to workers fired for using the hallucinogenic drug peyote
during religious ceremonies.
   In a 5-3 ruling involving two men from Oregon, the justices
stopped short of deciding whether there is a constitutional right
to take peyote as a religious practice.
   _ Cleared the way for the reinstatement of a Postal Service
letter carrier from Garden City, N.Y., fired for failing to deliver
more than 3,500 pieces of mail.
   The court let stand an arbitrator's ruling that Edward Hyde is
entitled to his old job.
   _ Ruled that a railroad worker is not entitled to be represented
at an employer's disciplinary hearing by his own union when a
different union is the official collective bargaining agent for
employees.
   The 9-0 ruling rejected arguments by Paul G. Landers, an
engineer who has worked for Amtrak since 1983 on passenger trains
in the Northeast.
   The child support case is Hicks vs. Feiock, 86-787.

   A bomb exploded today along the Kabul
River in the center of the capital and shattering windows in a
two-square-block area. Six people were killed and 49 injured, an
Afghan official said.
   The vehicle in which the bomb was planted was destroyed in the
explosion at 12:40 p.m. (4:10 a.m. EDT), but it appeared to have
been a truck or a small bus. Three buses and two taxis also were
damaged.
   Col. Gen. Saifullah, who is in charge of security in Kabul, said
the dead included four men, a woman and a young girl. He said 27 of
the injured were hospitalized.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass reported earlier that
preliminary information indicated four people were killed and seven
were injured.
   ``Investigating authorities said the truck, which arrived in
Kabul from Pakistan, must have carried an estimated 330 pounds of
explosives,'' Tass said.
   Foreign journalists were visiting Kabul for the 10th anniversary
of Afghanistan's Marxist revolution, which was observed Tuesday
with a massive military parade.
   It was not clear whether the vehicles were occupied when the
explosion occurred.
   The explosion was likely the work of anti-communist rebels
fighting the pro-Moscow government of President Najib.
   Afghan soldiers and police prevented the foreign journalists
from getting closer than 100 feet to the bombed vehicle, whose
charred chassis lay on the river bank, then drove them away.
   Two of the journalists, Jonathan Landay of United Press
International's New Delhi bureau, and Japanese photographer
Yasusuke Ota, were held by police for more than an hour before
being released.
   The police sealed off the densely populated area of the capital
and warned passers-by that there was a danger of other explosions.
   The vehicle in which the bomb was planted apparently was parked
along a gravelly stretch of river bank across a street and about
200 feet from the nearest building.
   Afghan shopkeepers spent the afternoon sweeping broken glass and
rubble from buildings along a two-block stretch of both sides of
the river.
   Western diplomats said earlier this week that rocket strikes on
the city have become less frequent in recent months as Najib's
troops and Soviet soldiers have gained a stronger hold over the
capital.
   But car bombs have been set off by the guerrillas with
increasing regularity to show opposition to the current government
and the Soviet presence.
   A rocket also hit the eastern hills of Kabul on the morning of
the Revolution Day celebrations.
   Thousands of soldiers, workers and weapons coursed for more than
two hours on Tuesday through Ideghi Square after a night of
unusually heavy rifle fire. Najib led dozens of Afghan officials
and a Soviet delegation to the parade. About 500 guests and
visiting journalists were clustered under striped awnings on a
reviewing stand.
   Insurgents supported by Pakistan, the United States and other
countries have been fighting the Afghan government since April
1978, when a Soviet-inspired revolution brought a socialist
government to power.
   Soviet soldiers entered the war in December 1979, and an
estimated 115,000 remain to bolster Najib's government.
   Under an agreement signed in Geneva on April 14, the Soviet
troops will begin a withdrawal on May 15 that is expected to be
completed by the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   Liberace's attorney said he made more
than $400,000 in legal fees for working on the late entertainer's
estate, but testified that the payments were ``anything but a
windfall.''
   Beverly Hills attorney Joel Strote on Tuesday defended the fees
as reasonable for work he did in 1987 as executor of Liberace's
estate and trustee for two trusts set up by the famed pianist.
   ``This was a very difficult job that took up almost all of my
waking hours. For all intents and purposes it was my only client,''
said Strote, who billed the estate for $58,475 in one month alone.
   Strote also acknowledged that Liberace had provided a separate
trust for his seven dogs. ``Mr. Liberace loved his dogs and wanted
to provide for their care after his death,'' Strote said.
   Testifying in a civil suit in state District Court brought by
five Liberace associates, Strote said he charged $250 an hour. He
estimated the value of Liberace's estate at $11 million.
   Strote said he plans to bill the estate the same $250 an hour
for defending himself in the suit, including the three days he has
spent on the stand.
   The five plaintiffs are seeking to remove Strote as trustee of
two trusts and executor of Liberace's will, claiming Strote has
mismanaged the assets. Strote was named executor by Liberace only
days before the entertainer died Feb. 5, 1987.
   The five include Liberace's sister, Angie; his longtime manager,
Seymour Heller; housekeepers Dorothy McMahon and Gladys Luckie; and
Cary James, Liberace's live-in companion for the last seven years
of his life.
   Under questioning, Strote said he had not paid the five
plaintiffs as provided in the Liberace will, setting aside their
money pending the outcome of the current litigation.
   Strote said the dogs had the run of Liberace's homes while the
entertainer was alive but he had ordered them restricted to certain
areas when Liberace died. He said some carpets had been ruined by
the dogs.
   ``I realized the dogs should be kept in an area where they
couldn't do any damage'' so the property could be kept in
``pristine'' condition, Strote said.
   Strote said he had not replaced carpets soiled by the dogs
because ``I feel people want the home like he lived in it.''
   He compared the homes to a classic car, saying some people would
want a car's old, worn interior because it was authentic.
   Strote said the stained carpets were not replaced before the
houses were shown because ``I felt this enhanced the value.''

   The May 4 deadline for illegal aliens to
request amnesty will not be extended, says an author of the new
immigration law.
   ``You have until May 4, and after that there will never be
another extension since any belief in that would only serve to
increase illegal immigration,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said in
a speech Tuesday.
   Although there is considerable pressure on Congress to extend
the deadline, Simpson noted, the House and Senate will be in recess
when the deadline passes, and there is no way it will be extended.
   The new law gave aliens who had been in this country since
before 1981 from May 4, 1987, through May 4, 1988, to sign up for a
legalization program. Simpson said the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has been approving 95 percent of the
applications.
   Simpson said aliens who cannot get immediate documentation that
they have been in the United States for the required period should
report to the INS before the deadline and they will be allowed to
furnish documents later.

   Male and female Harrison County Jail
inmates have been kissing in violation of jail policy, according to
testimony in the trial of a Florida woman charged with the death of
a state trooper.
   Sheriff Larkin Smith said he plans to investigate the
allegations made Tuesday in Anita Krecic's capital murder trial.
   ``We'll take a look to see if there is a problem,'' Smith said.
   Krecic has been charged in the April 10, 1987, shooting death of
Mississippi Highway Patrol officer David Ladner. Inmates from the
jail, where Krecic was held after her arrest, have been called as
witnesses.
   Inmate Elicia Lindsey of Gulfport, who studied the Bible with
Krecic, testified a trusty named Dino Rodriguez was Krecic's
boyfriend and had been inside the inmate's cell without supervision.
   ``Dino came to her bed a couple of times and kissed her,''
Lindsey said.
   When asked by District Attorney Glenn Cannon what kind of kiss
it was, Lindsey replied, ``She said it was a holy kiss at first.''
   ``And what about the second one,'' Cannon asked.
   ``It was a holy kiss,'' she replied.
   Lindsey testified former inmate Toni Wood and trusty George Ruth
also had kissed.
   When asked about the testimony, Smith replied, ``You're not
dealing with a bunch of Sunday school people.''
   Smith said only trusty inmates _ those accorded special
privileges _ have access to inmates of the opposite sex. Kissing
could only happen if the trusty inmates were left alone, Smith
added.
   ``I would hope that didn't happen,'' Smith said. ``If I
determine that happened, somebody would be in trouble.''
   Inmates testifying for the prosecution had said Krecic told them
she had ordered a companion, Tracey Hansen, to kill the trooper
after the two were stopped by Ladner for a traffic violation. The
defense called other inmate witnesses who said Krecic declined to
discuss the case.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa called today
for nationwide pressure on authorities during a massive strike by
steelworkers, and the government said unrest was spreading.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the number of strikers at
the Lenin steel mills outside Krakow grew to at least 2,000 since
the strike began Tuesday. He said a bus drivers' strike in
Bydgoszcz on Monday ignited demands for drivers' pay increases in
other cities.
   Ewa Kaberna, a Solidarity activist in Stalowa Wola in southeast
Poland, announced a call for a strike at the start of the first
shift Friday at the 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant there for
pay increases of $50 a month.
   In a statement issued in Gdansk, Walesa said: ``Our union
appeals to all living social forces ... for the undertaking of
united actions to put pressure on the authorities.
   ``At the moment, we need a new policy which would fully answer
the questions worrying Polish families and which would restore
society's ... rights,'' he said. ``Millions of people are waiting
for restoration of the rights of their trade union, Solidarity.''
   The labor unrest appeared to be the most serious in Poland since
the December 1981 martial-law crackdown suppressed the Solidarity
independent labor federation, which remains banned although its
leadership is still active.
   Strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwar
Poland and caused government shakeups in 1956, 1970 and 1980, when
a wave of strikes helped give rise to Solidarity.
   Urban, in a telephone interview, said the government has
predicted ``pay-related conflicts. So it is true that the strikes
may spread.''
   ``The situation in Poland is getting hotter and hotter. Anything
can happen any place,'' Walesa told reporters Tuesday in Warsaw.
   The steel strike began one day after a strike by 2,800 transit
workers in the western city of Bydgoszcz shut down buses and trams
for 11 hours and won a 60 percent increase in hourly wages.
   Urban said city transit workers in Lodz, Torun and Grudziadz
asked for raises in the wake of the Bydgoszcz settlement and that
nationwide talks were planned with official transit union
representatives Thursday.
   He said about 2,000 people were on strike at midday at the Lenin
mill in a ``peaceful and matter-of-fact'' atmosphere. Opposition
spokesmen estimated the number of strikers as 70 percent to 80
percent of the 10,000 first-shift workers.
   Workers rejected an offer broadcast over loudspeakers at the
start of the afternoon shift for a $50 monthly raise to be phased
in by October, Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said in Warsaw.
   Workers originally sought increases of $30 a month but later
raised their demands to an immediate 50 percent raise, Kuron and
other opposition activists said. Monthly pay now averages about
$105, union activists said.
   The talks also concern the economic condition of retirees and
the state of the national health service, said Zbigniew Lenyk, an
opposition spokesman in Krakow.
   Urban said negotiations were taking place between worker
representatives and plant management.
   In his statement, read over the telephone by Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Walesa said Solidarity has been
calling attention to the lack of improvement in the economy for
months.
   ``Growing feelings of harm and hopelessness are causing strike
actions,'' he said. ``Solidarity fully supports actions in defense
of living standards.''
   In addition to higher wages, a strike committee formed at the
32,000-worker plant in Nowa Huta demanded amnesty for strikers,
news coverage of the walkout and reinstatement of workers fired for
past union activities.
   The state-run news agency PAP, on its English-language service,
today carried its first report on the Nowa Huta strike and said
plant managers should resist the strikers' demands. There were no
Polish-language media reports on the strike.
   Stanislaw Sitkowski, the head of the officially sanctioned union
at the Lenin works, today said many members of his union were
taking part in the strike. ``We are of the opinion that wages are
too low,'' he said.
   The steel mills comprise the main industry in Nowa Huta, a city
built outside Krakow after World War II as a model of socialist
society.
   Prices climbed 42 percent in this year's first quarter, the
government says, mainly as the result of a government economic
reform program that aims to make prices more realistic, in part by
reducing subsidies for staples.
   But the higher prices have led to demands for pay raises.

   George Bush today celebrated his early lock-up
of the Republican presidential nomination and declared ``I can't
wait'' to debate whomever the Democrats nominate. President Reagan
edged closer to a formal endorsement of his vice president.
   Reagan, asked by reporters if he was ready to end his official
position of neutrality, replied, ``I'm going to have to arrive at
that if there are no others'' in competition for the nomination.
   The vice president, who stood virtually alone after his five
rivals for the nomination folded or froze their campaigns, coasted
to a mathematical victory in the Republican contest Tuesday with a
final push from the voters of Pennsylvania.
   He said he would keep campaigning in the GOP primaries, since
``I don't want to project an overconfidence or an arrogance that I
don't feel and that I have no reason to feel.''
   Bush, in brief interviews, said on NBC-TV that he was prepared
to debate Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis _ or whomever else the
Democrats might nominate _ and he challenged Dukakis on CBS-TV to
``fire away'' on the Iran-Contra issue.
   He said his vice presidential running mate will have to be
someone he feels comfortable with, since ``I wouldn't want to look
over my shoulder wondering if the vice president in his moral
outrage would be carving me up every day, building his own agenda
or her own agenda.''
   Bush noted that the Democratic Party has won most blacks' votes
for decades, but he said that could change if Jackson's supporters
don't like the way he is treated as the campaign plays out.
   ``If he's not treated fairly, a lot of people are going to be
open-minded and if I campaign properly with the way I feel in my
heart about openness and inclusion we might surprise people
there,'' Bush said.
   Bush, who won the Pennsylvania GOP primary with 79 percent of
the vote, early today surpassed the 1,139 delegates needed to win
the party's presidential nomination, according to The Associated
Press delegate count.
   The vice president met briefly in the morning with Reagan and
White House chief of staff Howard Baker. But Reagan told reporters
later that Bush's clinching of the nomination was ``so recent I
haven't even congratulated him yet, which I'm going to do, about
his going to the top.''
   But already, Bush was beginning to focus on the fall election.
He took the opportunity Tuesday to attack Democratic front-runner
Dukakis, saying the Massachusetts governor lacks the experience
needed to handle foreign policy.
   ``That will be a major issue in the fall,'' Bush said.
   What may not be an issue is charisma, with Bush and Dukakis both
battling an image of being lackluster campaigners.
   ``What's wrong with being a boring kind of guy?'' Bush said.
``Running for president is serious business.'' Anyway, he added,
``I kind of think I'm a scintillating type of fellow.''
   Bush entered the Republican race as the party's front-runner and
got off to a shaky start with a third-place finish in the Iowa
caucuses in February. He bounced back with a victory eight days
later in the New Hampshire primary.
   All through the campaign, Bush managed to stay on top of the
race for national convention delegates, despite a strong early
challenge by Kansas Sen. Bob Dole.
   Bush turned the nomination battle into a rout by sweeping his
party's 16 Super Tuesday primaries on March 8.
   Clinching the delegates prompted Bush to acknowledge he had won
the nomination with the GOP convention in New Orleans still four
months distant and with former TV evangelist Pat Robertson still
offering token resistance.
   Robertson issued a statement late Tuesday saying, ``I
congratulate George Bush today on his magnificent victory. ... I
plan to suggest that he and I meet together in the near future to
discuss ways that I and my supporters might be helpful.''
   Bush plans to summon Republican governors and experts on foreign
policy and economics for a week-long session in June at his home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, to help him shape issues for the fall
campaign, according to spokesman Peter Teeley.
   The session will take place while Reagan is attending the
U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow, Teeley said.

   Navy salvage workers who boarded the USS
Bonefish as the abandoned submarine drifted in the Atlantic today
found the bodies of the three men missing after explosions and fire
rocked the ship, Navy officials said.
   A Navy salvage crew boarded the submarine Tuesday but had to
pump out toxic gases swirling through the hull before they could
enter the ship, which had been adrift since Sunday.
   The dead were identified as Lt. Ray Everts Jr., 30, of Naoma,
W.Va.; Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39, of
Willis, Texas; and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren,
21, of Pisgah Forest, N.C.
   Chief Petty Officer Terry D. Borton, a spokesman at Atlantic
Fleet headquarters here, said two of the bodies were found at their
stations in the control room of the ship and a third was found in
an administrative compartment.
   The rest of the 92-man crew escaped serious injury when they
abandoned the 219-foot, 30-year-old vessel, which was drifting
alongside two salvage ships 160 miles east of Port Canaveral, Fla.
   The Navy anticipates towing the vessel to its homeport of
Charleston, S.C., said Chief Petty Officer Joseph C. Mowery,
another fleet spokesman. The salvageships USS Petrel and USS Hoist
are assessing the safety and manner of towing the ship back to
port, he said.
   The causes of death would not be known until a full medical
report was done, Borton said. The salvage crew entered the vessel
shortly after midnight to test for toxic gases left by the fire in
the diesel-electric sub's forward battery compartment.
   Lt. Michael Langston, chaplain at the Asheville Naval Reserve
Center in Asheville, N.C., said he was told to notify Lindgren's
mother and brother in nearby Pisgah Forest. ``She's pretty
distraught,'' he said of Mrs. Lindgren.
   Everts' sister, Cynthia Williams, said the Navy had sent someone
to their house this morning to announce that Everts' body had been
found. The Navy gave no further details, said Williams, of Naoma.
   ``We'd really rather not say anything yet,'' said Williams.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations, said
Tuesday in Washington that the three men were on watch in the sub's
control room and may have died at their posts as they made sure
everyone got clear.
   Another sailor said, however, that the men were newly assigned
to the ship and may have gotten lost in the smoke and gas that
filled the hull.
   ``Avery thought maybe they got confused and got turned around in
the smoke,'' Alice Causey, mother of Petty Officer 1st class Avery
Causey, said Tuesday.
   Causey said he himself was blinded by the smoke and was only
able to escape because a wave washing over the ship guided him to
an open hatch.
   ``Even though the emergency lights were on, he couldn't see
them. ... None of the drills they do could have prepared them for
what happened,'' said Mrs. Causey, who is from Jacksonville, Fla.
   Causey, 30, was one of 89 of the Bonefish's 92 crewmen evacuated
Sunday after explosions and fire filled the vessel with smoke and
toxic gases. Three of 22 injured crewmen remain hospitalized.
   The Bonefish's captain, Cmdr. Mike Wilson, praised the heroism
of his crew. ``It was a very harrowing experience we went through
out there,'' he said upon arrival Tuesday in Charleston, S.C., his
ship's home port.
   Wilson would not comment further because an investigation of the
fire is pending, said Lt. Cmdr. John Tull, public affairs officer
at the Charleston Naval Base.
   The Navy said the first explosion hit the Bonefish on Sunday
afternoon as it was running at periscope depth, engaged in training
exercises with surface vessels 160 miles off Florida.
   The crew was able to surface the Bonefish and Wilson ordered the
evacuation. Crew members abandoned ship and were taken to shore by
the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the frigate USS Carr.
   A five-man salvage crew aboard the Bonefish waited for strong
winds and rough seas to subside Tuesday afternoon, then conducted
tests that found high concentrations of toxic gases inside, said
Lt. Fred Henney, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk.
   ``They're pumping air through the ship to get the toxic gases to
leave,'' he said. Henney said he did not know what type of gases
were in the vessel.
   A civilian submarine expert said the 30-year-old Bonefish, one
of the Navy's last remaining diesel-electric subs, was probably
full of toxic chlorine gas created by fire in the ships's forward
battery compartment.
   ``The typical accident happens when hydrogen builds up in the
battery compartments while the sub is charging the batteries,''
said Norman Friedman, author of ``Submarine Design and
Development.''
   The sub is powered on the surface by diesel engines, but when
submerged it uses electric motors powered by two battery
compartments. The batteries are recharged by a generator when the
ship is surfaced or at periscope depth.
   ``A spark ignites the hydrogen _ and remember the ship is full
of electric motors _ and you have an explosion followed by a fire
and that fire produces the chlorine gas,'' Friedman said.
   The Navy would neither confirm nor deny that the submarine was
charging its batteries at the time.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   April 21
   The Providence (R.I.) Journal on the Democratic presidential
race:
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts is now the likely
presidential nominee of the Democratic party in 1988.
   He is likely to be the nominee _ but for reasons that may not
serve him so well in November. ...
   He clearly appeals to a wider range of Democrats than Jesse
Jackson, but somehow lacks the capacity to generate enthusiasm
among potential supporters.
   He has not sprinted to his front-runner status, but worn his
opponents down. To the governor's way of thinking, this may
constitute a hidden advantage: After eight years of charisma, he
suggests, perhaps competence will appeal to voters.
   Perhaps it will. But with a Moscow summit at the end of next
month, another arms-control agreement apparently in the works, with
the economy booming, unemployment declining, a stabilized dollar,
shrunken inflation, peace talks in Managua, and the Russians
backing out of their Afghan war, it's an uphill journey for any
Democratic candidate.

   Los Angeles Daily News on the Kuwaiti airliner hijacking:
   The 16-day hijacking of a Kuwaiti jumbo jet ended ... without
the Kuwaiti government capitulating to the hijackers' demands for
the release of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists.
   It wasn't a total victory _ the hijackers, after all, got away
with murder _ but give Kuwait credit for setting the right example.
The terrorists set out to free their cohorts, and they came away
empty-handed.
   Kuwait apparently had to give ground in two ways. First, in
return for surrendering the jetliner and their hostages, the gunmen
received safe passage out of Algeria. ... Second, unconfirmed
reports ... indicated that the Kuwaiti emir agreed to commute the
death sentences of three of the 17 imprisoned terrorists to life.
...
   Kuwait and other nations _ including the United States _ should
now spare no expense in their efforts to track down and arrest
those responsible for the hijacking.
   After all, the hijackers commandeered a jet, killed two innocent
people, terrorized dozens of others, focused world attention on
their cause and then slipped back under their rocks no worse for
wear.
   Kuwait, meanwhile, should not delay in carrying out the death
sentences against the three terrorists who were sentenced to death
for the bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in December 1983.

   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on aid to the Contras:
   The Nicaraguan Contras, denied arms to fight Soviet expansion in
Central America by the U.S. Congress, now find themselves being
starved into submission.
   U.S. aid to the freedom fighters expired Feb. 29. Congress
finally approved a package of non-lethal assistance after a truce
was reached March 23 between the Contras and the leftist Sandinista
government. ...
   But the kicker was that no assistance could be delivered until
agreement was reached on resettling the rebels in the cease-fire
zone.
   Day by day, the refusal of Congress to stand behind our
government's commitment to democracy is taking its toll on those
who bravely resisted the spread of totalitarianism.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on the airline smoking ban:
   Airline passengers on domestic flights lasting two hours or less
are breathing easier.
   That's because a new FAA rule that took effect Saturday
prohibits smoking on those flights.
   The hazards of cigarette smoking, and breathing second-hand
smoke, have been well documented.
   We believe that those who choose to smoke should have the right
to do so _ as long as that action does not infringe on the rights
of nonsmokers to breathe clean air.
   With smokers now in the sizable minority, it's not too much to
ask that they cease their habit for two hours or less for the
comfort of nonsmoking travel companions.

   The McPherson (Kan.) Sentinel on Attorney General Meese:
   If President Reagan is keeping Attorney General Edwin Meese on
the job out of loyalty to an old friend, he certainly doesn't need
any enemies. ...
   Nearly every day a new report pops up detailing the man's lack
of judgment, lack of common sense, ineptitude or shameful disregard
for ethics in government. ...
   Today's report, for example, comes from former Assistant
Attorney General Lawrence Wallace, who says that Meese participated
in Justice Department deliberations affecting telephone companies
in which he owned stock. ...
   Obviously with those kinds of ethics, Meese shouldn't be this
nation's number one law enforcement officer and Reagan should fire
the bum.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on the trade bill:
   The comprehensive trade bill approved by the House of
Representatives is an improvement over the overly protective
measure that existed just two months ago. But that's not saying
much. ...
   The trade bill, as now written, includes several provisions that
could allow the United States to take retaliatory action with
quotas and tariffs against other nations.
   Funny. Usually when these goods enter the United States,
Americans buy them because they are built well or because they are
less costly than U.S.-made goods. ...
   If the Senate doesn't water down this measure, Reagan should
veto it.

   The World, Coos Bay, Ore., on the Persian Gulf conflict:
   Is it right for us to be involved in the Persian Gulf?
Certainly; the United States made its interests in open shipping
there very clear a long time ago.
   Did we take the right ``measured response''? We believe so,
since the attack was limited in scale, and aimed at military
targets.
   Will this all end Iran's temptation to be a festering sore in
the region? Given the recent history of that nation, and its
apparent need to treat the United States as ``the Great Satan,'' we
guess it will not.

   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on compensating imprisoned
Japanese-Americans:
   Only one step remains _ President Reagan's signature _ before
the nation can offer its official apology to the 120,000
Japanese-Americans who were unjustly imprisoned in relocation camps
during World War II.
   The compensation legislation would give each of the 60,000 camp
survivors $20,000. While varying payments on the basis of
individual losses incurred might be more equitable, it is
impractical almost 50 years after the fact.
   Money, of course, cannot compensate these Americans and their
families for the loss of their homes, jobs and businesses.
   Nor can it make up for the shame and sorrow they suffered at the
hands of a government which did not see the error in violating the
Constitution at the same time it was fighting a war to defend it.
...
   The nation cannot repay the 77,000 American citizens of Japanese
ancestry and the 43,000 legal and illegal aliens for depriving them
of their rights, but conscience demands that it make this
long-overdue gesture of heartfelt regret.

   North Jersey Advance, Flanders, N.J., on Larry Speakes and
presidential quotes:
   Whether or not (former White House spokesman Larry) Speakes
committed some cardinal sin ... by attributing quotes to
(President) Reagan that (he) did not utter is debatable.
   But it is a fact that Reagan either tolerated his doing so, did
not know about it or, alas, does not remember again.
   Reagan sidestepped the question: ... ``Did you approve of the
process, and would you continue to allow that to happen in your
White House?''
   Reagan responded that he ``just learned it recently, as all the
rest of you did.''
   He went on to speak of his lack of ``affection for the kiss and
tell books.'' ...
   In seeking to deflect the question, the president all but
admitted that he had condoned what Speakes did. It was the telling,
not the kissing, that he found objectionable.

   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal on the Conservation Reserve
Program:
   The recent drought has made blowing topsoil more visible in
South Dakota, but it's nothing new.
   Easily erodible soil is best left undisturbed. Depleting soil
destroys a resource that we depend upon for life itself.
   That's why the success of the federal Conservation Reserve, a
program that pays farmers to return easily eroded croplands to
undisturbed tree and grassland sanctuaries for wildlife, is
encouraging. This is part of the federal farm program that makes a
great deal of sense. ...
   Considering the values promoted by the Conservation Reserve and
alternatives, it is a remarkably worthwhile federal initiative.
   The Conservation Reserve Program does cost some money.
   So did the Dust Bowl.

   The Knoxville (Tenn.) News-Sentinel on Sen. Robert Byrd:
   The old fiddle player from West Virginia, Sen. Robert Byrd, is
trading in his Senate Democratic leadership for the chairmanship of
the Appropriations Committee.
   It's fitting that Byrd, 70, should step aside and let younger
blood into the leadership. ...
   In announcing his intention to give up the Democratic
leadership, Byrd said it has been a 30-year-old goal of his to head
the Appropriations Committee. He's entitled, but there is something
disconcerting about his reason for wanting it. ...
   Even the chairman of the state Republican Party welcomed the
news with the comment: ``In West Virginia, we may oppose pork
barrel projects as a concept, but, by God, if they are going to
come to West Virginia, we're not going to oppose them.'' ...
   West Virginia deserves a fair share from the Washington till.
But let's hope that after Byrd takes over the committee, the
federal government won't suddenly start moving those rugged West
Virginia mountains around for the big defense implacements and that
multibillion-dollar canals and dams won't begin to sprout among the
hills.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on the Supreme Court's
alcoholism decision:
   Everybody knows that if you want a medical opinion, you go to a
doctor, and not a lawyer.
   Yet, four U.S. Supreme Court justices rendered what is widely
interpreted as a medical opinion ... that could have a negative
effect on attitudes toward alcoholism for years to come.
   While insisting it was not directly addressing the question of
whether alcoholism is a disease or a weakness of character, the
court erred on the side of imprudence when it ruled two veterans
who suffered from alcoholism cannot qualify for certain government
benefits because their drinking was the result of ``willful
misconduct'' (weakness of character).
   This ``diagnosis'' has come from the field of law, and not
medicine. Recognition of alcoholism as a disease has led to
breakthroughs in treatment of afflicted individuals and in the
treatment of those individuals by society, particularly in the
courts (excepting now the Supreme Court).
   If alcoholism is not a disease in the eyes of the federal
government, then how long will it be before jail becomes the
principal treatment center at the local level, and the town drunk
is reinstated as an object of ridicule?

   The Times, Gainesville, Ga., on Attorney General Meese:
   Attorney General Edwin Meese got another whack across the ears
(last) week when yet another choice to be his top deputy said no.
   Most mules pay a little attention after a few whacks. How long,
how many before Meese understands?
   All of the numerous probes into his activities may show him to
be perfectly innocent of any criminal wrongdoing. He is entitled to
that presumption.
   But he is guilty of tremendously bad judgment in hanging on to
his office when doing so is eroding public confidence in the
department's integrity, destroying morale within the department and
eroding support for the president he serves.
   The only worse judgment we've seen in this affair is that of
President Reagan in not telling him it's time to go.

   When Chrysler Corp. announced the closing of its Kenosha (Wis.)
assembly plant, CEO Lee Iacocca pointed to the bottom line. The
plant's profitability was weak. Chrysler can't afford that, the
boss said.
   We wonder what he says about his performance.
   Business Week magazine rated the nation's highest-paid
executives on a formula that produces a ``pay performance index.''
   The best rating, which went to Genetech's Robert A. Swanson, was
438. The worst rating, a 3.5, was produced by Iacocca, who earned
$49,865,000 in the three years covered by the Business Week formula.

   The husband of a $1 million winner in
the New York state lottery was killed and his wife injured when the
woman's niece hired two men to kill the visiting couple, police
said.
   Officers said Armando Vasquez, 66, of Middletown, N.J., was
discovered strangled with a wire late Monday beneath a tree in the
back yard of a home he and his wife were visiting.
   After a neighbor heard screams and called police, officers
arrived in time to save the victim's wife, Norma, and arrest two
men, Lt. Albert Ortiz said. Mrs. Vasquez, 67, received only minor
injuries and was not hospitalized, Ortiz said.
   Ortiz said officers believe the couple's niece, a nurse at St.
Luke's Lutheran Hospital, hired the men to kill her aunt and uncle
and make it look like a robbery-killing.
   Linda Heredia, 34, the niece, was charged with capital murder
along with Henry Bellettini, 38, and Joe Hernandez, 17, all of San
Antonio. All three were held on $100,000 bond each.
   ``We're alleging Heredia solicited the other two suspects to
hire them for the murder of her aunt and uncle,'' Ortiz said. ``She
stood to gain some inheritance,'' he said.
   George Yamin, a state lottery spokesman in New York, confirmed
that the lottery had winners named Armando and Norma Vasquez on May
16, 1981. Mrs. Vasquez actually filled out the winning ticket; she
won $1,078,256 for selecting the correct six numbers, he said.
   According to the press release announcing Mrs. Vasquez's
windfall, she was a housewife and her husband was a sheet metal
worker. The couple lived in Union City, N.J., before moving to
Middletown.
   The couple had no children, the release said.

   Robbers disguised as police officers
entered a Brink's depot in this southern city Wednesday, broke open
strongboxes and stole an estimated $2.7 million, police said.
   According to police, the robbery took place in two stages. Armed
men went to the homes of two Brink's officials, taking them and
their families hostage overnight.
   At 6 a.m., the officials were taken to the central Brink's
depot. The robbers, believed to have numbered eight, disarmed
employees, opened the boxes and fled with the money about two hours
later in two vans.
   It was the second Brink's robbery in eight months. On Sept. 2,
armed men wounded two Brink's employees at Toulouse airport and got
away with about $4.4 million.

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials concluded

<DATELINE>FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep John Jenrette, who was
convicted eight years ago in the federal Abscam investigation,
announced today that he will not seek his old congressional seat in
this year's elections.
   Jenrette, calling it ``one of the most painful decisions I have
ever had to make,'' said he will not be a candidate because of his
inability to settle legal claims arising from former business deals.
   He also said federal judge has declined to terminate his parole
for his Abscam conviction. A condition of that parole was that he
not leave the state without checking with his parole officer.
   ``The failure to be relieved of probation and the inability to
settle these old, but just and legal claims, causes me to be in a
much different position than I had expected to be as a candidate,''
he said at a news conference.
   Jenrette, who represented the 6th District for six years, was
convicted in October 1980 of conspiracy and accepting a $50,000
bribe from an FBI agent posing as an Arab shiek.
   The 51-year-old former congressman, a recovering alcoholic and
disbarred attorney, has set up a public relations firm in Florence
and in recent months has been testing the political waters for a
challenge of popular incumbent congressman Robin Tallon, a fellow
Democrat.
   Jenrette lost to Republican John Napier the month after his
Abscam conviction. Tallon defeated Napier two years later and has
held the seat since.
   Jenrette said he owed $175,000 to the Myrtle Beach Air Force
Base credit union to settle claims arising from the Old Heritage
Shores development project. He said he has paid $75,000 of that and
had hoped to exchange a piece of property to settle he rest of the
claim.
   But credit union officials did not agree to that arrangement.
   In February, the state attorney general ordered Jenrette to pay
more than $100,000 that investors lost in time-sharing rights at an
Edisto Island resort.
   Ninety-five people lost investments of up to $6,000 apiece when
loans for Club Oristo were defaulted in 1980 before construction
was completed on the property.
   ``I cannot ask my friends to make the sacrifices necessary until
such time as I might be able to get my personal and business
affairs in order. I will not be a candiate in 1988,'' Jenrette said.
   Asked if he would be a candidate for public office in the
future, Jenrette said, ``I don't know about that. I hope to be able
to contribute in some way.''
   He added that he expects Tallon to be the Democratic nominee and
that he would support the nominee of the party.
   The story of John and Rita Jenrette made headlines across the
nation during the early 1980s. Jenrette along with six other former
members of Congress were convicted in the Abscam probe.
   Rita Jenrette later posed in Playboy magazine and wrote an
expose about life in Congress, including an account of the two
making love on the Capitol steps, and their acrimonious divorce.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man whose pregnant wife took the state bar
exam for him after he flunked was sentenced to three years
probation in a ruling decried by his now-divorced wife as too
lenient.
   Morgan Lamb, 35, of Los Angeles, was also ordered Tuesday to
perform 500 hours of community service in connection with his
January conviction on three felony counts of forgery and false
impersonation.
   Lamb's ex-wife, Laura Beth Salant, 32, was put on probation last
year after pleading no contest to a pair of felony false
impersonation counts. Her conviction was subsequently reduced to a
misdemeanor.
   Ms. Salant, who attracted attention by finishing the test with
grades ranked third among 7,668 applicants, contended she was
physically and emotionally abused until she agreed to take the
three-day test for Lamb.
   Lamb, who had failed the bar with marks in the bottom fifth of
his test group, claimed it was all his wife's idea.
   ``I don't see how any reasonable judge could not give him a jail
term,'' Ms. Salant said. ``But then it's not reasonable to expect
that Morgan Lamb would tell the truth about what happened.''
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin refused to take
sides during Lamb's sentencing, saying both parties should be
considered equally to blame since both are law school graduates.
   But a probation report said Lamb wasn't sophisticated enough to
have devised the test fraud scheme, calling Ms. Salant the brains
behind the deception.
   The couple met while they were law students at the University of
California, Los Angeles, and Ms. Salant went on to become a highly
praised lawyer with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.
   She lost her SEC job after the test fraud allegations surfaced
and could be disbarredr.

<HEAD>Israelis Kill Two Arab Guerrillas After Attack on Truck</HEAD>

   Troops tracked down and killed two Arab
guerrillas who infiltrated Israel, attacked an Israeli truck with
guns and a hand grenade and wounded its driver today, the army said.
   It was the second day in a row Arab guerrillas from Lebanon have
clashed with soldiers inside Israel. The new attack occurred about
two miles from Tuesday's border clash, in which two Israeli
soldiers and three Palestinian guerrillas were killed, military
sources said.
   It was not immediately clear if the guerrillas infiltrated
Israel today or came with the group that entered from Lebanon
Tuesday.
   In Beirut, George Habash's Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, one of eight factions in the Palestine
Liberation Organization; and the Lebanese Communist Party, headed
by George Hawi, claimed responsibility for today's attack.
   The army closed roads in northern Israel and ordered women and
children in the dozen settlements north of Kiryat Shmona to stay
indoors while troops searched for the guerrillas by foot and
helicopter, police in northern Israel said.
   The guerrillas, armed with light weapons and other hand
grenades, evaded troops for three hours until they were discovered
and killed in a nearby dry riverbed, military sources said.
   The truck driver, Danny Dahan, was attacked at ``Tank
Junction,'' where a ruin of a Soviet tank used by the Syrians in
the 1967 Middle East war stands as a memorial, the sources said. He
was shot in the hand and taken to nearby Safed Hospital where he
was operated on, a doctor at the hospital said.
   After the truck attack, Israeli men from the settlements were
ordered to take up arms and go to assigned guard posts, said Zvi
Yuval, 37, from Kibbutz Senir about three miles south of the
border. During the search he heard continuous gunfire, including
shots from helicopters, Yuval said in a telephone interview.
   ``We fear there will be more attacks this summer. The vegetation
is like a jungle,'' giving guerrillas places to hide, Yuval said.
   It was the 12th penetration or infiltration attempt since Nov.
26, when a lone guerrilla landed a hang glider in northern Israel
and killed six soldiers before he was shot to death himself.
   Earlier in the day, a U.N. source who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the the army fired artillery and flares early today
near where the Israeli soldiers and guerrillas clashed Tuesday.
   Army radio reported explosions in the area overnight, but it
gave no details.
   Also today, a 14-year-old Palestinian girl died of wounds
suffered a day earlier after Israeli troops opened fire on Arab
protesters in a village in the occupied West Bank, army officials
said.
   The death brought to 174 the number of Arabs killed in
anti-occupation unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war. Two Israelis also have
died since the rioting began Dec. 8.
   In Syria, Palestinian officials said Yasser Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization, plans to escalate the
5-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. The
officials spoke on condition of anonymity after Arafat finished
talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad and headed for Iraq.
   In Beirut, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
claimed responsibility for the border attack on Tuesday. The
statement was accompanied by what the group said were photographs
of the three slain guerrillas.
   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the army's northern command, said the
guerrillas had planned to attack Israeli settlements. Israel
Television said they had carried a map of settlements in the area.
   The army said Tuesday the soldiers spotted the infiltrators'
footprints and tracked them. It said the guerrillas hid in thick
bushes inside Israel and opened fire when the army unit approached.
But an earlier report from a Lebanese police spokesman said the
guerrillas were ``apparently ambushed before launching a
cross-border raid into northern Israel.''
   In Arab east Jerusalem, most stores remained closed after
merchants voted Tuesday night to extend a strike through Thursday
to protest the arrest of 14 shopkeepers who violated police orders.
   Arab reports identified the dead Palestinian girl as Arish
Ismail Daoud Adik.
   The reports said two dozen soldiers in five jeeps on Tuesday
entered Kufr Dik, a village 20 miles southwest of Nablus, to break
up a demonstration by teen-agers who blocked roads with stones and
hung outlawed Palestinian flags from utility poles.
   Troops chased the teen-agers to the yard of the village mosque
and opened fire and Miss Adik was struck by a bullet to the head,
the reports said.
   The army's chief education officer, Brig. Gen. Nehemiah Dagan,
also said today Israeli soldiers commit an average of 200
``excessive acts'' against Palestinians in the occupied territories
each month.
   Dagan, in remarks to Israeli educators, did not elaborate on
what he meant by excessive acts but said he was concerned about how
five months of confrontation with Palestinian protesters would
affect young soldiers' moral values.
   The soldier ``stands there with a club in his hand and gets a
rock thrown in his face,'' the daily Hadashot quoted Dagan as
saying. ``Two thousand years of life in exile pour into the hand
holding that club.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top official of the Organization of
American States has told Secretary of State George P. Shultz that
U.S. food shipments to Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras are
illegal, the OAS said Wednesday.
   OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, a member of the
commission assigned to verify compliance with the temporary
cease-fire agreement between the Contras and the Sandinista
government, stated his position in a letter sent to Shultz on
Monday, the OAS said.
   The dispute involves $47.9 million in humanitarian assistance
approved by Congress four weeks ago after the Contras and the
Sandinistas signed their agreement.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development was assigned the
task of managing the aid program and has sent 125.6 metric tons of
food by truck to Contra camps in Honduras starting last week.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused the United States
last Friday of concealing weapons and ammunition in the shipments.
   AID denied that allegation, asserting the trucks were inspected
and found to be free of lethal equipment by members of the Honduran
clergy before the trucks departed the Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa.
   In his letter to Shultz, Baena Soares said he believes the
shipments ``do not fall within the provision of the instruments
which regulate the deliveries of humanitarian assistance.''
   The temporary truce, signed at Sapoa, Nicaragua, a month ago
permits the rebels to receive humanitarian assistance, but the
Sandinista government has said deliveries can be made to the rebels
only after they resettle in designated cease-fire zones in
Nicaragua.
   The Contras and the Sandinistas have reached agreement on the
location of the zones but differences remain over ground rules
governing activities inside these areas. Meanwhile, the Contras
have not resettled in them.
   An AID official, speaking Wednesday only on condition of
anonymity, said there was nothing in the Sapoa agreement or the
legislation which would preclude delivery of assistance to rebels
in Honduras.
   The administration also has been worried about signs of
increasing hunger among the thousands of rebel fighters. Many have
crossed into Honduras from Nicaragua in recent weeks in search of
food.
   The Nicaraguan position is that the verification commission is
the only body authorized to assure that aid shipments are
restricted to humanitarian items. It maintains that the commission
can begin verifying compliance with the agreement only when the
rebels have resettled in the cease-fire zones.
   Baena Soares is one of two members appointed to the commission
at the Sapoa talks. The other is Nicaraguan Cardinal Miguel Obando
y Bravo, who has not yet passed judgment on the legality of the AID
deliveries, officials said.
   Talks between the Sandinistas and the Contras on the aid issue
and other topics resume Thursday in Managua.
   Baena Soares left Washington for Managua on Wednesday to take
part in the talks.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he stands by his
criticism of the Rev. Jesse Jackson before New York's Democratic
primary, but says he regrets that his belligerent style and sharply
worded attacks offended Jackson's supporters.
   In a statement released hours after Police Commissioner Benjamin
Ward called on the mayor to apologize for his ``divisive'' remarks,
Koch said he had ``articulated my concerns in a way that,
regrettably, offended a large number of people, both black and
white.''
   ``I would hope they will look beyond my style to the substance
of what I said, which I believe was fair political criticism.
   ``The words I used were too sharp. These are words I have used
for years. Because of the particular sensitivity of this situation,
I should have been more careful in my choice of words.''
   It was highly unusual for Ward _ the city's first black police
commissioner and a Koch appointee _ to comment on political matters
that did not directly involve the police department, but he said he
felt the need to do so because he was being asked regularly about
Koch's anti-Jackson efforts.
   In a letter that appeared in today's editions of The New York
Times, Koch said, ``It was never my intent to draw political lines
with racial or religious borders.''
   Ward said today he was ``absolutely'' satisfied that the mayor
never intended to insult the black community.
   Koch's attacks on Jackson have brought a continued backlash and
have prompted early efforts to form a coalition to defeat the mayor
next year, when it is expected he will seek a fourth term.
   When asked if Koch was apologizing to Jackson as well as his
supporters, the mayor's press secretary, George Arzt, responded:
``Whatever the letter says. We're not going beyond it.''

   A barrier was built at center stage, a symbol
of the split between Arab and Jew. So volatile was the mix, so
tense the topics, that nobody was quite sure if all the panelists
would show up.
   But it happened almost as planned, and officials at ABC said
they were pleased after bringing Palestinians and Jews together
Wednesday for a marathon ``Nightline'' session, live from the Holy
Land.
   ``It worked,'' anchor Ted Koppel told reporters after the nearly
3{-hour show at the Jerusalem Theater. ``We got Israeli Jews and
Palestinians to sit together, in public, and hold a dialogue.
That's unusual.''
   The dialogue was not always pleasant. The panelists, four
Israeli legislators and three Palestinian academics, took turns
angering sections of the crowd made up of both Jews and Arabs.
   But Koppel said the fact that nobody came to blows was an
achievement.
   ``There was a real concern that these deep emotional feelings
would erupt into violence,'' Koppel said. ``So in that respect
alone, this was a big success.''
   The show, expanded from its normal one hour, was called a ``Town
Meeting'' by ABC and was planned as the highlight of a week of
``Nightline'' broadcasts from Israel.
   The network filled the theater with a handpicked audience of
750, including about 150 Palestinians from the occupied
territories. The Palestinians, many of whom wore checkered Arab
scarves, sat on the left side of the theater. The Israelis, many
wearing knitted skullcaps, sat on the right.
   Most of the Palestinians arrived at the theater, a plush complex
behind President Chaim Herzog's residence, in buses provided by the
network.
   ``Nightline'' executive producer Richard Kaplan said Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin had intervened to make sure the buses passed
quickly through army checkpoints.
   During much of the show, Koppel straddled a barrier separating
the Palestinian panelists from the Israelis. He said the barrier,
built hastily the night before, was demanded by the Arab
participants.
   ``They meant to show they were not talking directly to the
Israelis, they were talking to me,'' Koppel said. The Arab
panelists never focused on the Israelis, looking only at Koppel or
the audience.
   The barrier only was part of the ``delicate diplomatic
maneuvering'' needed to recruit Arab panelists, Kaplan said, adding
that until shortly before the show the network was not sure if it
had a panel.
   Koppel opened the show at 6:30 a.m. (11:30 p.m. EDT) with a plea
to the audience to keep cool.
   ``I know you will have strong opinions, but please have enough
respect for each other to express them in the form of a dialogue,''
he said.
   Tensions ran high throughout the program, starting when Hanan
Mikail Shwari, a dean at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank,
called Arab stone-throwing a ``symbolic act.'' Many Israelis
guffawed in disbelief or hissed loudly.
   They reacted angrily again when Saib Erekat, a professor at
Nablus' An Najah university, said the Arab uprising ``carries a
message of peace.''
   Palestinians booed when Eliahu Ben Elissar, a right-wing
legislator from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, said
conditions were better for Arabs under Israeli rule.
   The Arab-Israeli dispute was not the only cause of friction. At
one point, Israeli legislator Haim Ramon of the centrist Labor
Party tangled with his Likud counterparts, prompting one viewer to
call out, ``We need another barrier!''
   Koppel took breaks from the dialogue to screen brief TV spots.
   In one report, an Arab family cowered inside their house in the
West Bank city of Nablus as Israeli troops fired tear gas and
rubber bullets outside.
   A second showed a night patrol by an Israeli soldier who spoke
of being attacked with huge rocks by hostile Arabs ``who hate us.''
   A third report, which recounted past Palestinian terror attacks,
left some Jews in the audience in tears. Another examined Israeli
tactics against Arabs such as deportations and house demolitions.
   Mubarak Awad, a Palestinian who advocates non-violent resistance
to Israel's occupation, said the show ``helped to break images.''
   ``I think Palestinians saw Israelis could be civilized and
Israelis saw Palestinians could be civilized,'' he said.
   An Israeli viewer, Adam Hanover, said the show would have been
more useful if it pitted Palestinian leaders against Israeli
leaders. ``It's too bad we didn't have the PLO here,'' Hanover said.

<HEAD>IRS Puzzled by Fewer Requests to Extend Filing Deadline This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe the new federal tax law isn't so
confusing after all.
   The Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday that the number of
taxpayers who asked for automatic four-month extensions of the
April 15 filing deadline was 18.4 percent below last year's mark.
Slightly over 5 million extensions were requested last year, and
because of the new law, the IRS had anticipated 6.2 million this
year.
   ``We don't know how to interpret that 18.4 percent reduction,''
IRS spokesman Jeff Krasney said. He added, however, that since the
agency was concentrating on processing returns before handling
extensions, statistics on the number of extensions may not be
totally up to date.
   ``Next week's figures might give a truer picture of
extensions,'' he said.
   Through April 22, the IRS had received 94.9 million returns, up
1.1 percent over the same period of 1987, Krasney said. The agency
had processed 64.12 million, up 0.5 percent.
   The IRS said 79 percent or 50.66 million of the processed
returns qualified for refunds, down from 79.6 percent or 50.77
million at the same time last year. The average refund this year is
$842, up 0.7 percent from the $837 last year.

<TEXT>
   The $243,000 windfall a Dallas radio station
received after an on-the-air solicitation will be distributed to
charities that help the homeless, hungry and abused, according to
the man who started the drive.
   ``We just found things that made us say, `Ooh, that's
wonderful.' Now the fun part comes and we just start distributing
funds,'' KVIL disc jockey Ron Chapman said Tuesday.
   It was Chapman who asked listeners several weeks ago to send in
$20 without telling them why. Within four days, the station had
received $243,120.
   After days of reviewing numerous suggestions and requests,
station officials settled on a disbursement plan Tuesday.
   Recipients and will be the Salvation Army, $100,000; Common
Ground Community Economic Development Corporation, $13,000; East
Dallas Community School, $14,900; Tarrant County Food Bank,
$56,000; and Women's Haven of Tarrant County, $16,000.
   The station, which still has not decided on how to spend the
remaining $43,000, was deluged by suggestions from various people
and organizations who had ideas on how to spend the money.
   Hundreds wanted to help station officials figure out what to do
with the money, and hundreds more wanted some of the rence Welk fans wanted
to rebuild his birthplace in North Dakota.
   Chapman said donors will be told by letter how the money will be
spent and if the donors disagree, their money will be sent back.
   The Salvation Army intends to use its share to build a clinic at
the Carr P. Collins Center.
   ``This is an answered prayer. It really is,'' said Maj. Frank
Gordon, area coordinator for the Salvation Army services in greater
Dallas.
   The East Dallas Community School, a school for about 40
underprivileged students with a waiting list of 300, will build and
equip two new classrooms.
   ``We are ecstatic. This is the best thing that could have
happened,'' said Terry Ford, founder and director.
   The Tarrant County Food Bank will use its money for a new truck
to deliver food donations to area food banks, shelters and agencies.
   Common Ground, a small community group that helps the homeless
and the poor find jobs and housing, will get $13,000 for a new
computer system.
   The Women's Haven of Tarrant County Inc., a Fort Worth shelter
for victims of domestic violence, will get a van to transport
children to school.

   President Reagan today gave his permission for
Canada to buy tightly-held U.S. nuclear submarine technology, but
he and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appeared to make
little headway in settling a dispute over acid rain.
   The leaders met at the White House for an hour to discuss their
differences over the acid rain pollution problem, but ``nobody
tried to bridge'' the disagreements, a senior U.S. official said.
   The official said that during a half-hour private session
Mulroney presented some new ideas on the issue, but further
discussions between experts will be required before it can be
determined if the proposals are palatable to the United States.
   The Canadian government is considering the purchase of 10 or 12
nuclear-powered attack submarines, either from Britain or France.
Since the British ``Trafalgar'' class subs use American power
plants, U.S. permission will be required if the Canadians pick the
British design.
   The official said Reagan informed Mulroney that he would approve
the technology transfer _ making Canada the first nation outside
Britain to be eligible to acquire the technology.
   Congressional approval also is necessary.
   Mulroney, with Reagan standing beside him at a welcoming
ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, reminded the
president that they had pledged during a meeting in Canada to work
together on the acid rain problem.
   ``This, as you said in Quebec City, Mr. President, is a problem
that belongs to both of us. We must continue and we shall to work
together for an equitable solution to this important challenge,''
Mulroney said.
   Reagan, in his welcoming remarks, asserted that progress had
been made in improving air quality.
   Smoke from cannons that boomed out a salute wafted over the
White House grounds as Mulroney stood at Reagan's side.
   Reagan said the agreement would lead to an ``unshackling'' of
U.S.-Canadian trading relations.
   ``I'm confident that the legislatures of both countries will
vote favorably on this historic free trade agreement,'' Reagan said.
   Mulroney was quoted last week as saying that U.S. acid rain
emissions are similar to the United States' ``dumping garbage in
Canada.''
   Asked at a brief photo opportunity before his meeting with
Reagan if he stood by the comment, Mulroney said:
   ``I think it is very clear. The acid rain has that effect in the
eastern United States and Canada. Yes, I think that's a normal
fact.''
   On Friday, the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said it was unlikely the two countries would reach an accord on
acid rain by Jan. 20 when the Reagan administration leaves office.
The official said: ``No, I don't. It is a difference in approach.''
   Canada wants the United States to set specific targets and
timetables for the reduction of emissions causing acid rain. The
U.S. official insisted that scientists have not yet discovered a
way to judge the success of such an effort.
   ``If you are going to put a lot of money into something, you had
better make sure you have the right technology,'' the official
said. ``You had better know there is a direct relationship between
what you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from.''
   Asked if the Reagan administration is concerned about the cost
of a cleanup, the official said, ``It is too dear if you are using
the wrong technologies and when you get all done you haven't solved
the Canada problem. People are just simply very reluctant to say,
`Here we go full tilt,' and when you get done you haven't solved
the problem as it addresses itself in the U.S.-Canadian
relationship.''
   Underscoring the differences, U.S. diplomats negotiating in
Geneva on an international pollution agreement this week demanded a
right for the United States to emit 20 percent more of a key
precursor of acid rain than it produced last year. This allowance
would be in the form of credits for the achievements of U.S.
control progams in place since 1975, which have reduced nitrogen
oxide emissions 8.5 percent since the peak year of 1978.
   Canada had agreed to a draft that would have permitted increases
in U.S. nitrogen oxide emissions as long as they did not result in
increases of the pollutant moving into Canada, said Sheldon Meyers,
acting associate administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency for international programs.
   Meyers said the United States told Canada it did not believe
northbound flows of nitrogen oxides could even be measured and,
``There's no way we could agree'' to such a provision in light of
projected increases in U.S. emissions.
   Although most attention has been focused on sulfur oxides
emitted by coal-burning power plants and other sources, nitrogen
oxides emitted by those plants, by motor vehicles and by other
sources are believed to generate a third of the extra acidity of
acid rain in the eastern United States and Canada.
   The Reagan administration has generally adopted the line that
more research is needed. Northeastern states, which like Canada
have noticed damage to their forests and lakes, have sided with
their northern neighbor in calling for tough limits on pollutants
from coal-burning plants and other sources of acid-causing
emissions.
   Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey are suing the Environmental
Protection Agency, seeking new emission controls similar to those
sought by Canada.

   Former investment banker Arthur K.
Salomon was sentenced today to 1{ to 4{ years in prison for
shooting a teen-ager after a dispute on a highway.
   Salomon told the court that last June 19, the day he shot
Gianluca Cotugno, was a day ``I'd like to forget as much as the
Cotugno family.'' He said he had been under a lot of stress due to
the death of children of family friends.
   ``I don't expect the Cotugno family to ever forgive me,'' said
Salomon, 53, of Pound Ridge and Manhattan.
   Under a plea bargaining agreement, Salomon had pleaded guilty to
assault for the shooting off the Hutchinson River Parkway.
   State Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabella, who had
originally indicated he would sentence Salomon to two to six years,
said he had received numerous letters describing him as an ``good
and decent person.''
   He also said it was lucky that the bullet had missed vital
organs and that the young man was still alive.
   Salomon is the grandson of one of the founders of the Salomon
Brothers investment firm. He was surrounded in court by family
members, including his wife, Lisa, and son, Tony.
   According to authorities, Salomon and Cotugno, 19, were both
driving south in the left lane. Cotugno tried to pass, but Salomon
refused to pull his Mercedes into the right lane.
   Cotugno, of Larchmont, exited in Scarsdale and Salomon pulled
onto a grassy knoll, then saw Cotugno get out of his car with his
hands waving, he said.
   Prosecutor George Bolen said today that Cotugno was upset and
swearing, but that as he approached the car, he saw Salomon
pointing a gun at him, took down the license plate number and told
Salomon he was going to notify police.
   ``Salomon placed the car in gear, started it toward Mr. Cotugno
and shot Mr. Cotugno once in the chest,'' said Bolen, adding that
he wanted the remarks ``to set the record straight'' as to what the
prosecution believed happened.
   Neither Cotugno nor family members were in court, but the family
lawyer, Stephen Heard, said the youth's $20 million civil suit
against Salomon would proceed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan
with a conference next month.

<HEAD>Army Inquiry Says Teen-age Settler Killed by Gun of Jewish Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army inquiry said today that a Jewish guard
accidentally shot and killed a teen-age settler during a stoning
attack by Palestinians on the occupied West Bank.
   But the report blamed Arab residents of Beita for the April 6
confrontation in which two Palestinians and the young Jewish woman
were killed and the guard was seriously wounded.
   A senior military spokesman told reporters that villagers had
``been planning to attack Jewish settlers'' for days before the
clash with the Jewish hikers in Beita.
   The confrontation stirred strong emotions in Israel. It pitted
Jewish settlers against the army after leaks from the military
investigation said 15-year-old Tirza Porat was killed with the
guard's gun.
   It came as the Israelis have been trying to put down a
Palestinian uprising against their occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, territories they seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
Since Dec. 8, Israeli soldiers have killed 174 Arabs, and one other
Israeli has been killed.
   Today's report criticized hike organizers, saying they were
negligent in failing to coordinate their activities with the army.
It also said the wounded guard, 26-year-old Romam Aldubi, showed
``negligence in operating the weapons, ignoring common sense
precautions, and over-hastiness in pulling the trigger.''
   The military spokesman, Col. Raanan Gissin, said Aldubi had been
``hasty'' in opening fire at villagers who threw rocks at the
hikers while they walked through a valley near the village.
   ``The way in which Aldubi used his arms throughout this
incident, there was clearly negligence and perhaps violation of
safety precautions,'' Gissin said.
   The wounded guard was in critical condition at Jerusalem's
Hadassah hospital.
   The first reports said the girl was shot to death. Later,
reports had indicated that Arabs killed the teen-ager with a rock
after attacking the 16 teen-age hikers and their two adult guards
near Beita.
   Despite the army leak, Jewish settlers have maintained the
teen-ager was shot by a villager using a Soviet-designed
Kalashnikov rifle.
   The report disagreed: ``Porat was shot by Aldubi's gun,
apparently after he reacted instinctively to the rock thrown at his
head.''

   A high-level Cuban delegation has met in Panama
with strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to tell him ``the
Panamanian people are not alone,'' according to a Havana Radio
report monitored here today.
   The delegation was headed by Rene Penalver, second secretary of
Cuba's government-controlled Central Worker's Confederation.
   In a statement broadcast today, Penalver said Panamanians, ``as
have other peoples fighting North American imperialism, will have
the solidarity of the Cuban working class.''
   Penalver, from Panama City, said his delegation told Noriega
``the Panamanian people are not alone in this battle.''
   The broadcast also said Noriega has met with a Czechoslovakian
delegation to discuss the threat of U.S. military intervention and
the current economic sanctions.
   The sanctions were imposed by the United States following
Noriega's February fdrug-trafficking indictment in Florida.

<HEAD>Jackson Pressing Dukakis to Move Leftward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson has been saying Michael Dukakis has
picked up some of his issues but ``I'm the real thing.'' Now
Jackson, with nomination hopes dimming, is pressuring the
Democratic front-runner to adopt even more of his positions.
   In speeches, debates and interviews, Jackson seems to be
shifting his focus from winning the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination to trying to shape the party's platform and moving
Dukakis to the left on spending issues. In that way, he still could
affect the policies of a Dukakis administration, should the
Democrats win in November.
   But Dukakis has not been moved by Jackson's prodding on such
issues as doubling federal spending on education, allocating $3
billion in new money to Head Start and laying down a complete
federal budget outline.
   ``He's doing his thing and I'm doing my thing,'' Dukakis said in
Langhorne, Pa. on Monday.
   The Massachusetts governor has simply stuck to his own call for
new education initiatives, some without price tags, and his general
support for other social service programs. And he says he hasn't
adopted Jackson's positions.
   ``These are issues that have been of great concern to me all
during my political career,'' Dukakis said Wednesday, adding that
he and Jackson share more than issues. ``We share a lot of the same
goals and values. We disagree on some things, too, but we've always
done that in a friendly way.''
   Jackson has been careful to keep the focus on the issues and not
to criticize Dukakis personally.
   ``As I seek to make this world better, to bring jobs at home and
justice and peace in the world, we're going to show the difference
between politics as usual and politics of change,'' Jackson said
Wednesday. ``The debate will show differences, but not division.''
   In Cincinnati on Tuesday, Jackson said Dukakis had followed his
lead on a number of issues.
   For example, he said, ``People have told me that Dukakis is
going into the schools now talking about drugs. Well, that just
ratifies my leadership. People say you're talking about the same
things. What's the difference? Well, it's butter or margarine. I'm
the real thing.''
   Jackson laid down the challenge to Dukakis to adopt more of his
positions in a pair of Pennsylvania debates before Tuesday's
primary.
   ``I've put the numbers together to pay for my dreams,'' Jackson
told Dukakis on Saturday night in Mundall, Pa.. ``I commit myself
to doubling the education budget. It's the best investment. ... I
want to add $3 billion to Head Start. ... And the war on drugs,
it's going to cost.''
   When Dukakis replied without giving specific dollar figures,
Jackson chided him: ``That is not a commitment to add to Head
Start.''
   And on day care and housing, Jackson has said he has specific
plans and Dukakis does not.
   Jackson also pressed Dukakis to toughen his stance against South
Africa, suggesting that that country's government be designated a
terrorist regime. Dukakis promises ``tough action'' against South
Africa, but he would not adopt Jackson's stance.
   The Massachusetts governor said later during the weekend that
Jackson's call for him to put out a proposed federal budget is
absurd.
   ``One thing I have learned very painfully is that you can't be
drawing up budgets today for next year. No candidate knows exactly
what you're going to confront,'' Dukakis said.
   Referring to his first year as governor _ when he had to renege
on campaign promises on the state budget _ he was emphatic: ``I had
to eat an awful lot of crow and I'm never going to make that
mistake again.''
   Dukakis said he would continue to talk about the specific
spending measures he wants to discuss.
   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that
in great detail. I'll lay out where I think we ought to do some
investing _ I've done that in great detail,'' he said on Sunday.
   Dukakis issues adviser Tom Herman says pointedly, ``Jackson has
not put out a budget either.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CHILD SUPPORT
   
   The court ruled that a divorced parent may be held in civil
contempt and jailed for failing to pay child support even if not
proved financially able to do so, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said such a finding of civil
contempt does not violate constitutionally protected due-process
rights.
   The case is Hicks vs. Feiock, 86-787.
   
   HALLUCINOGENIC DRUG
   
   The court raised the possibility that states may deny
unemployment benefits to workers fired for using the hallucinogenic
drug peyote during religious ceremonies.
   In a 5-3 ruling involving two men from Oregon, the justices
stopped short of deciding whether there is a constitutional right
to take peyote as a religious practice.
   The case is Employment Division vs. Smith, 86-946.
   
   MAILMAN
   
   The court cleared the way for the reinstatement of a Postal
Service letter carrier from Garden City, N.Y., fired for failing to
deliver more than 3,500 pieces of mail.
   The justices let stand an arbitrator's ruling that Edward Hyde
is entitled to his old job.
   The case is U.S. Postal Service vs. National Association of
Letter Carriers, 87-59.
   
   RAILROAD WORKER
   
   The court ruled that a railroad worker is not entitled to be
represented at an employer's disciplinary hearing by his own union
when a different union is the official collective bargaining agent
for employees.
   The 9-0 ruling rejected arguments by Paul G. Landers, an
engineer who has worked for Amtrak since 1983 on passenger trains
in the Northeast.
   The child support case is Hicks vs. Feiock, 86-787.

<HEAD>Statue Owned By St. Louis Art Museum Was Stolen In 1914</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a little help from Interpol, a Roman
statue displayed here is going back to the French museum from which
it was stolen in 1914.
   The bronze, a six-inch statue of Hypnos _ the god of sleep _ was
given to the St. Louis Art Museum in 1953.
   The museum's board of commissioners voted Tuesday to give it
back to the Musee des Beaux Arts et d'Archeologie in Besancon,
France.
   French police may come to St. Louis this summer to claim the
statue, one of six bronze objects stolen in 1914, a French museum
official said.
   The statue was given to the St. Louis Art Museum by the late J.
Lionberger Davis, a lawyer, art collector and museum patron, said
James Burke, museum director.
   Burke said the statue was neither a particularly valuable nor
important work and was worth no more than $5,000. He said the
statue has not been displayed at the museum for at least 20 years.
   The statue's ownership came into question as it was about to be
auctioned at Sotheby's in New York last year. A few days before the
auction, two scholars who had seen the statue in a catalog
questioned its authenticity and suggested that it might be a copy
of the missing Besancon bronze, Burke said.
   A day before the auction, Interpol, the international police
force, notified Sotheby's that the statue was believed to be the
stolen bronze itself and the statue was withdrawn from the sale.
   The authenticity of the statue was determined when a plaster
cast made from a 160-year-old mold of the Besancon bronze was
compared to the statue in the St. Louis collection. The plaster
cast and the St. Louis bronze were identical, down to a crack in
the left arm and scratch marks on the buttocks, Burke said.
   Sidney M. Goldstein, associate director of the St. Louis museum,
said he had no reason to believe that either Davis or his dealer
had known that the object had been stolen. He said he had planned
to take the statue to the Besancon museum himself as a gesture of
good will, but a French museum official said the statue must be
turned over to the French police.

   Here are some basic points in the disagreement
between the United States and Canada over acid rain:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What is acid rain?
   Although rain is naturally somewhat acidic, ``acid rain'' refers
to the additional acidity added by pollutants _ sulfuric acid
formed from coal-burning power plant and factory emissions, and
nitric acid from power plant, factory and motor vehicle emissions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Why is it important?
   Environmentalists say in eastern North America, the extra acid
is killing fish and other aquatic life in lakes and streams. Also,
they say, it corrodes buildings, bridges and monuments, adds to
stress on declining forests and, in the form of acidic haze,
reduces visibility and threatens health.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What can be done?
   New coal-fired power plants already must meet strict emissions
standards, but few are being built these days. It's the large
plants in the U.S. Midwest built generally in the 1950s through the
mid-1970s that people are concerned about, especially since they
are lasting longer than most people figured.
   New coal plants generally use ``scrubbers'' to remove the acid
in the smokestack. Although 146 scrubbers are in service, fitting
them to old plants would be expensive _ several estimates say $5
billion a year.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Why hasn't something been done?
   In part because the Reagan administration and congressional
delegations from heavy coal-producing states maintain that more
research should be done first. They say not enough is known about
the scale of the damages to justify such massive expense.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Why is Canada concerned?
   Half the acid rain that falls in Canada originates in sulfur
dioxide emitted by U.S. sources.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What does Canada want?
   Canada, U.S. states in the Northeast and environmentalists have
pressed for a roughly 50 percent cut in sulfur dioxide emissions.
Various bills in Congress to accomplish this have failed.
   Most recently, Canada proposed a treaty that would commit the
United States to a 44 percent reduction in the northbound flow of
sulfur dioxide.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What about Canadian emissions?
   Canada contributes minor amounts to U.S. acid rain _ perhaps 25
percent, because of wind patterns, in the Adirondack Mountains of
New York state. Canada has embarked on a program aimed at cutting
its own sulfur dioxide emissions 50 percent by 1994.

   President Reagan today described as ``totally
inaccurate'' a published report that some of his close friends and
advisers have mounted a campaign to force Attorney General Edwin
Meese III from office.
   Asked about the report in The Wall Street Journal, which said
that first lady Nancy Reagan supports the effort to oust Meese,
Reagan said:
   ``I shouldn't answer the question. But I have to tell you, no,
I'm not aware'' of such a move.
   During a picture-taking session in the Oval Office with visiting
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Reagan reacted heatedly to
the Journal report. ``The story was totally inaccurate,'' he said.
   Asked what circumstances might prompt him to get rid of Meese,
the president replied, ``Well, if he had a complete change of
character.''
   The Journal story, in today's editions, said that in addition to
working for Meese's ouster, some White House officials have sounded
out former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger as a possible
successor to Meese.
   Weiberger, asked today about the possibility of taking over as
attorney general, said, ``I think we have a good attorney
general.'' Interviewed briefly in Orlando, Fla., Weinberger said he
had no desire for more government service.
   While Reagan repeatedly has indicated his support for Meese, the
dump-Meese effort has just ``gone underground,'' the newspaper
quoted one unidentified White House official as saying.
   Reagan insiders, including Weinberger and longtime campaign
consultant Stuart Spencer, are convinced that ethical questions
plaguing Meese are threatening the Republican Party and damaging
the Justice Department, the newspaper said.
   A spokesman for White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker was
quoted as saying ``he denies any knowledge of any such effort'' to
oust Meese.
   The advisers want to present Reagan with a completed quick-exit
package, similar to one that forced out former Chief of Staff
Donald Regan, the newspaper said.
   Under this plan, Meese would quit and be quickly replaced by
someone with recognized stature and abilities. So far, a
replacement hasn't been found, the newspaper said.
   Aides to Vice President George Bush last week said Meese's
troubles have become a political liability to Bush, who now has
enough committed delegates to secure the Republican presidential
nomination.
   The aides, who requested anonymity, said Bush would be relieved
if Meese resigned but has found it difficult to speak out on the
matter.
   Bush and Baker were both present last week when two resigned
Meese aides laid out their case against the attorney general to the
president.
   Asked to comment on Mrs. Reagan's reported role in the Meese
ouster campaign, Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary,
said: ``She hasn't been making any telephone calls, she hasn't been
getting any telephone calls, she's not involved in it.''
   Mrs. Reagan, who was believed to be instrumental in Regan's
ouster, also ``knows that Meese has to go,'' the newspaper said,
quoting a person familiar with the first lady's views.
   Asked about this, Mrs. Crispen replied, ``It's very difficult
for me to respond to these ghost quotes _ I don't know if this
person has talked to the first lady in the past year. I do know
that she hasn't been involved in any campaign'' to oust the
attorney general.

   William Weld, the Justice Department criminal
division chief who resigned in protest March 29 over Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's continued tenure, will join the
Washington office of a Boston law firm along with two former
Justice Department aides who quit with him.
   Weld, Jane Serene and Mark Robinson will join the Washington
office of Hale and Dorr, a 250-member Boston law firm.
   Weld will become a senior partner and will work in the
Washington office through September, then he will move to Boston
and will divide his time between the two cities.
   Serene and Robinson, who will become junior partners in the
Washington office, are wrapping up their work at the Justice
Department and will leave shortly. Weld left the department the day
he resigned.
   The three will be handling civil and criminal litigation with a
specialty in white-collar criminal defense.
   Before becoming a U.S. attorney in 1981, Weld was a partner in
the Boston law firm of Hill & Barlow.
   Weld and Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns resigned out of
concern that the nearly year-old criminal investigation of Meese
and the attorney general's refusal to resign were hurting the
Justice Department's operations, morale and public image.
   As special counsel to Weld, Serene has reviewed criminal cases
and dealt with legal, policy and management issues affecting the
criminal division. She was a special attorney on the New England
organized crime strike force from 1984 to 1987.
   Robinson was chief of staff and general counsel to Weld, and now
is acting deputy assistant attorney general supervising three
sections of the Justice Department's criminal division.

<HEAD>World Population Could Double in Your Lifetime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time they reach middle age, Americans
born today could be sharing the planet with twice the current
number of people, a private population research group reported
Wednesday.
   The world's population, which edged past the 5 billion mark just
a year ago, could double within 40 years, the Population Reference
Bureau said in its annual ``World Population Data Sheet.''
   ``We've been noticing for a couple of years now that the overall
growth trend has not been following the standard projections ...,''
Carl Haub, an analyst for the bureau, said in a telephone interview.
   The anticipated decline in birth rates in many less-developed
nations has not been as great as hoped, he said, and ``it is likely
that the sixth billion (person) will be added in just 10 more
years.''
   While projecting the world's population into the future requires
assumptions about birth rates, Haub noted that the global
population has been rising faster than previously anticipated.
   It took all of human history to raise the world's population to
1 billion, which occurred in the early 1800s _ during the
presidency of Thomas Jefferson.
   More than a century was required to add the second billion,
which occurred about 1930, according to the United Nations Fund for
Population Activities. The population rose to 3 billion by 1964, 4
billion in 1974 and 5 billion in 1987.
   The next billion could be added by 1998, said Haub.
   There is a perception that world population growth is a problem
of the 1970s, Haub observed, ``so we thought it was time to point
out that it's still growing faster than had been projected.''
   The bureau's data sheet shows worldwide population growing at
1.7 percent annually. The United Nations had projected growth of
1.6 percent.
   ``That doesn't sound like much,'' Haub said, but in a world of 5
billion inhabitants, the difference represents 5 million more
people per year.
   Population growth hasn't followed the smooth trend downward that
had been expected in many deceloping nations, Haub said. He noted
in particular that China, India, Pakistan and Iran have high growth
rates.
   ``Some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smooth
path to the two-child family that we have been predicting,'' said
Haub. He pointed in particular to China and India, where previous
reductions in births have not been maintained.
   The doubling of the world population in 40 years depends on
growth continuing at 1.7 percent, a rate that varies considerably
from country to country and region to region, Haub said.
   The more developed nations, for example, are growing at 0.6
percent annually, for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years,
the data sheet shows. On the other hand, the less-developed nations
could double in just 33 years, at a growth rate of 2.1 percent.
   Increasing fastest are Kenya and the disputed territory of Gaza,
currently occupied by Israel, each of which is expected to double
its population in just 17 years at current rates of increase.
   At the other end of the scale, five countries are not growing at
all _ Austria, Denmark, Hungary, East Germany and West Germany. And
Italy, at its current rate, would not double its population for
3,465 years.
   Changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progress
economically toward what population experts call the demographic
transition.
   In early societies, high birth rates are generally balanced by
high death rates. As economic conditions provide better medical
care and nutrition, death rates fall while birth rates remain high,
leading to rapid population growth.
   Eventually, history shows, birth rates also begin to fall in a
transition to balance again, as has happened in many more developed
nations.
   Social, religions and other differences among nations, however,
keep this change from being a smooth curve and help lead to the
many variations around the world.

<HEAD>Sierra Club Wins Revision in Wilson Campaign Ad Called Misleading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Praise from the Sierra Club was cut from a
television campaign commercial for Sen. Pete Wilson after the
environmental group said the message falsely indicated it had
endorsed the incumbent Republican.
   The television ad seen in the Monterey-Salinas area during a
weeklong test run quotes a 1984 letter from the club to Wilson
thanking him for supporting legislation that added 1.7 million
acres to state wilderness land.
   The commercial says Wilson fought developers when they
threatened the natural beauty of San Diego, where Wilson was mayor
during the 1970s. He cites his opposition to offshore oil drilling
proposals favored by the Reagan administration and mentions his
support of the 1984 wilderness bill.
   The commercial ends with the words ``For the wilderness bill,
wrote the Sierra Club of America, `Thank you, Senator Wilson.'''
   Sierra Club officials said Tuesday they object to the use of
their name in political ads by candidates they have not endorsed.
   ``It's the sort of thing where people aren't always listening
that closely to commercials, and they hear `Sierra Club' and
mistake it for an endorsement,'' said Joanne Hurley, the club's
national public affairs director.
   The environmental group has yet to endorse either Wilson, who is
seeking a second term, or his Democratic challenger, Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy.
   Otto Bos, Wilson's campaign manager, said Tuesday the offending
language will be removed from the commercial. But Bos said Wilson
was angered by the club's reaction to the commercial.
   ``We felt we were justified in showcasing a letter that was
freely sent,'' Bos said.
   Relations between Wilson and the club have become strained in
recent weeks over a bill pending in Congress that would grant
wilderness status to more than 9 million acres of California desert
land. The club strongly supports the bill, but Wilson has expressed
reservations.

   Country comedian Jerry Clower had a
ready solution for a Miami-based dry cleaning company that was
looking for someone in need of nearly 30 tons of unwanted clothing.
   ``I said, `Look, it's real simple. Give them to me,''' said
Clower, a native of nearby Yazoo City. ``It ain't complicated. I'll
give 5 tons to Tennessee and 5 tons to Mississippi.''
   The dry-cleaning company gave Clower 10 tons of clothes. In
December, Clower announced on The Nashville Network he was going to
give the clothes to the Salvation Army in those states. About 300
families received about 3 tons of free, dry-cleaned, used clothing
Tuesday. The giveaway was held at the Salvation Army's Camp Hidden
Lake 5 miles west of Lexington.

   While trying to placate any irked
Indianapolis natives, comedian Martin Mull turned his sights on
another city.
   Mull was quoted recently in Philip Morris magazine as saying
that baseball was superior to football because, among other
reasons, he didn't have to go to Indianapolis to watch it.
   ``Obviously what we're dealing with here is a typo,'' Mull told
The Indianapolis Star Tuesday. ``What it was supposed to say was
Annapolis. Because who in their right mind would want to go to
Annapolis?
   Mull has been to Indianapolis on numerous occasions to film
commercials for Claypool Court, a downtown shopping center owned by
Melvin Simon & Associates. A Simon spokesman said the company would
await public reaction to his article before deciding whether to
employ Mull again.
   Asked if some people in Annapolis might be offended by his new
comments, Mull responded: ``Yeah, but I don't care. There are no
Claypool Courts in Annapolis.''

   LeVar Burton and Louis Gossett Jr. will
re-create their roles as Kunta Kinte and Fiddler in a TV movie,
``Roots Christmas,'' 12 years after work started on the original
``Roots'' production.
   Production started on ``Roots,'' Alex Haley's story of a black
family's journey from Africa to slavery to freedom on April 28,
1976.
   ``Roots Christmas'' dramatizes ``the inherent lust for freedom
that motivated early mass escapes of slaves, which paved the way
for the ... Underground Railroad,'' Haley said at a news conference
at Burbank Studios.
   The setting for the tale is Christmas 1770. The Underground
Railroad was a system of safe houses set up by abolitionists to
move slaves to freedom in the years before the Civil War.
   The movie also stars Michael Learned, Shaun Cassidy, Avery
Brooks, Jerry Hardin and Kate Mulgrew.

   Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason says some
scathing remarks by the group's erstwhile bassist and singer Roger
Waters revived the 20-year-old rock band and acted as a catalyst
for their current platinum album.
   ``Roger was right when he said the band was creatively dead at
the point at which he left,'' Mason said. ``It was just that when
he had gone, we thought, `Oh, why not have another crack at it. Can
we do anything about it or not?' When we started the album, we made
sure we weren't committed to anything until we had done enough work
to say, `It works _ or we think it works. Let's carry on.'''
   The result was ``A Momentary Lapse Of Reason,'' a
million-selling LP that has produced the hits ``Learning To Fly''
and ``On The Turning Away.
   Mason, 44, said a legal settlement of the group's differences
with Waters is near, but a musical reconciliation is not. Waters
left Pink Floyd to pursue a solo career because of differences in
the making of the 1983 album ``The Final Cut.''

   ``Ziegfeld,'' a lavish new musical about the
legendary Broadway showman, received poor reviews from the British
press Wednesday following its glitzy opening at the London
Palladium.
   The Daily Mail critic Jack Tinker denounced the show as ``an
eye-zonking, mind-freezing extravaganza.'' He wrote: ``As the
audience applauded each successive parade of costumes, I knew with
a sinking heart that as a musical this is what put the z in
razzamatazz and the zzzz in `Ziegfeld'.''
   ``Ziegfeld'' stars Len Cariou, the Tony-winning star of
``Sweeney Todd'' on Broadway, as Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., the
womanizing Broadway producer celebrated for his 21 ``Follies''
extravaganzas between 1907 and 1931.
   The Daily Express critic Maureen Paton said, ``The stars are so
lacking in personality that they have a great future as wine
waiters.''
   Others were equally scathing, but Irving Wardle in The Times of
London was kinder: ``The subject has two built-in advantages: a
collection of marvelous old songs and a sumptuous wardrobe.''
   ``Ziegfeld'' was directed by Broadway veteran Joe (``Barnum'')
Layton and produced by Harold Fielding, both of whom appeared
on-stage at the opening to receive a standing ovation.

   The House today voted approval of two
Democratic-backed arms control restrictions, despite strong
opposition by President Reagan.
   The chamber split generally along party lines as it passed
252-159 a ban on any Star Wars tests that would violate the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Later it voted 240-174 to bar spending for any weapons that
would violate the numerical limits on various categories of atomic
weapons contained in the 1979 SALT II treaty. Reagan says the
Soviets are violating the unratified pact and thus he will no
longer follow it when deciding which U.S. weapons to build.
   The votes came as the Democratic-controlled chamber began
working on a huge bill authorizing the Pentagon budget for the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   In effect, the first vote requires Reagan to adhere to the
so-called narrow interpretation of the ABM pact, even though the
president asserts he has the legal right to move to a broad view
that would allow expanded Star Wars testing.
   ``This is unilateral disarmament of a benign, but nonethless
serious, sort,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a critic of the ABM
restricton.
   But Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., said, ``what we're talking about
is simply the same intepretation of the ABM treaty that's been
taken by every president since it was ratified.''
   Both amendments were added to last year's Pentagon budget bill
on votes which went largely along party lines. But they were later
altered during the House-Senate conference committee called to work
out differences between the defense bills passed separately by the
two chambers.
   The ABM fight arises from Reagan's contention that he can
unilaterally change how a treaty is legally interpreted by the
United States. Although Reagan has asserted such a right legally
exists, he has chosen not to exercise it.
   Congressional Democrats dispute Reagan's assertion, arguing that
a treaty cannot be changed without approval of the Senate, which
must ratify such pacts before they become effective.
   The fight has spilled over to the ratification of the separate
U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear forces.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on a 12-7 decision that
generally went along party lines, added an amendment banning the
INF treaty from being reinterpreted unless the Senate approves.
That amendment is expected to be the subject of a major fight when
the Senate considers ratification next month.
   The arms control fights are the first of a series of debates
that will stretch into next month as the House considers a bill
authorizing the budget of the largest single agency in government.
   The measure proposes to let the Pentagon spend $299.5 billion in
the next fiscal year, which is slightly less than the $300 billion
authorized in the current budget.
   The $299.5 billion figure was set last December as part of the
so-called ``budget summit'' between Reagan and congressional
leaders. The overall spending package is designed to reduce federal
budget deficits.
   The defense figure was $33 billion less than the Reagan
administration thought it would receive for the Pentagon next year,
and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci ordered the services to make
major budget cuts to meet the lower figure. Among the reductions
were the early retirement of some smaller Navy ships, along with
reductions in civilian employment by some of the services.
   The bill that passes the House will eventually go to a
House-Senate conference committee to be reconciled with the measure
that the Senate will approve.
   The Senate is proceeding at a slower pace, with its Armed
Services Committee meeting behind closed doors this week to write
its version of the bill.
   One major difference is the spending level for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.
   Reagan sought $4.8 billion for SDI next year, compared with the
current $3.9 billion budget. The House measure proposes $4.0
billion, although that figure could be changed when the issue is
debated next week. The Senate Armed Services Committee is
considering $4.6 billion.

   President Roh Tae-woo on Wednesday
appealed for a spirit of negotiation after elections in which his
party lost its legislative majority to a divided opposition.
   Strong provincial bases helped the opposition. Leaders of all
parties expressed fear of regional conflicts in the 299-member
National Assembly, where Roh's Democratic Justice Party won 125
seats and three opposition parties have a total of 164.
   Anti-government groups had held sometimes violent protests
before Tuesday's elections, claiming the government rigged them.
When the government lost, they canceled demonstrations scheduled
for Wednesday.
   The composite index of shares on the Seoul stock market plunged
a record 24.58 points Wednesday, to 620.1. The previous record was
21.69 on Feb. 26.
   ``We can foresee many difficulties in the future because of the
fact that the ruling party was not able to win a simple majority in
the National Assembly,'' Roh said.
   After noting that the new constitution strengthened the
legislature's powers, he said: ``Political maturity and a
willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiation have become even
more important if the administration and the ruling party are to
carry out their policies smoothly'' without a National Assembly
majority.
   ``I will humbly accept the will of the people as reflected in
the election and will do the best I can to duly carry out the
administration's policies,'' Roh said.
   He has pledged to continue democratic reforms begun after huge
anti-government protests last summer.
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the main opposition Party for Peace and
Democracy, promised cooperation if the government pursues reform
and pledged his help in making a success of the 1988 Olympics,
which begin Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   Many divisive political matters are expected to wait until after
the games. Opposition leaders said, however, they would press for
more investigations of alleged corruption under Chun Doo-hwan,
Roh's predecessor, and for release of the more than 1,000 prisoners
they say still are held for political reasons.
   Opposition leaders reminded Roh of the campaign pledge he made
last year to seek a public evaluation of his performance after the
Olympics. He has not said how he would do it.
   Roh won the presidency in December with 36.6 percent of the vote
because opposition support was split between Kim Dae-jung and rival
opposition candidate Kim Young-sam.
   In Tuesday's elections, Kim Dae-jung's party won 70 seats and
Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democratic Party got 59. Thirty-five
seats and the potential swing vote went to the New Democratic
Republic Party of Kim Jong-pil, a conservative former prime
minister.
   Independents and small parties won 10 seats.
   Many observers had expected Tuesday to be a repeat of the
December election in many districts where one government party
candidate faced two or more from the opposition.
   With new single-member election districts, however, the
government party was nearly shut out in some strongholds of
opposition parties. Under the former system of sending two
delegates to the National Assembly from each district, second place
won a seat.
   Analysts in the South Korean press said many voters shunned the
government party because of a perception of corruption and pressure
tactics in the campaign.
   On the day before the election, prosecutors reported finding
thousands of envelopes ready for mailing, each stuffed with 20,000
won ($27) and leaflets for a government candidate. The party
expelled him.
   There were violent protests when a television station broadcast
a report Monday of victory by a government candidate. The station
apologized, saying it was a technical error during a coverage
rehearsal.
   Protesters called it evidence that the government was
manipulating vote-counting computers. The candidate lost.
   Roh said of the strong performances by parties in traditional
regional bases: ``In a divided nation, the fact that regional
schisms have become so deep is alarming to all of us.''
   ``Divided nation'' was a reference to the peninsula's division
for four decades into communist North Korea and the capitalist
South.
   Kim Dae-jung said it was ``painful for the divided South to be
further fragmented into east and west.''
   The Reagan administration praised the elections, with State
Department spokesman Charles Redman saying they showed that
``democracy in South Korea is alive and well and getting stronger
every day.''

<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with NRA chief lobbyist offering qualified
endorsement of compromise</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The chief lobbyist for the National Rifle
Association today gave a qualified endorsement to compromise
legislation setting a minimum metallic standard for so-called
plastic guns.
   ``Our opinion is it's not a bad bill,'' said the NRA's James J.
Baker. He said the NRA's position from the beginning was to ensure
that legislation did not ban currently possessed firearms and did
not ban firearms currently being imported into this country. The
compromise achieves those goals, he said.
   ``As long as we're not banning any handguns, I don't have
serious problems,'' said the NRA lobbyist.
   The compromise requires that guns contain material that would be
as detectable by metal detectors as 3.7 ounces of stainless steel.
The gun could have less metal or a different kind of metal as long
as it would be as detectable as the stainless-steel standard.
   Baker said that ``I support it (the compromise) in principle,''
but he said he had reservations about some details.
   ``There still needs to be some minor tinkering,'' he said,
adding that the NRA was offering a ``qualified endorsement'' of the
compromise.
   Police organizations and gun-control advocates have insisted
that a minimum amount of metal be required in a gun to ensure
detection by the magnetometers used in airport and building
security systems.
   The NRA has insisted that there should be no
government-established metal standard, only a general requirement
that any gun be detectable by existing equipment.
   The compromise takes the law enforcement approach, and sets a
minimum metallic standard.
   Although differences over plastic gun legislation have triggered
a new and ferocious gun-control fight in Congress, sponsors of
rival bills said Tuesday's breakthrough could be a unifying force
for lawmakers on all sides.
   Joseph A. Morris, director of the Justice Department's office of
liaison, confirmed the agreement and said he hoped ``everyone can
claim victory.''
   Despite these optimistic comments, however, the general approach
adopted in the compromise has been attacked bitterly in past NRA
statements as an attempt to take guns from law-abiding citizens.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III, who at first publicly backed
the NRA's legislative position, now is committed to the compromise,
Morris said.
   The differences in the rival bills have never been
insurmountable, but they became magnified once the plastic gun
issue became the vehicle for the latest debate over whether the
government should control handguns.
   Almost lost in the bitter struggle was the fact that everyone
embroiled in the dispute expressed the same goal: making sure
potential terrorist weapons of the future will never be smuggled
onto airplanes or buildings with security requirements. Plastic
guns are not yet in production in this country, but there is
general agreement the technology exists.
   The gun control and police groups have argued that the NRA
approach would cause long delays in airports. They contended that
without a minimum metal requirement for the gun, magnetometers must
be used at settings so sensitive that they would constantly trigger
alarms.
   The NRA has said that the minimum standards established in
legislation would have banned a number of small metal handguns now
manufactured, and called one particular measure ``the first federal
gun ban bill in America.''
   In a fund-raising letter to its supporters just this month, the
NRA said that bills with minimum metallic standards would ``grant
unlimited power to government bureaucrats to ban millions more of
your guns.''
   However, those comments addressed bills with higher metal
requirements than the compromise between the administration and a
coalition of 11 police groups _ the Law Enforcement Steering
Committee.
   Morris said no currently made gun would be banned under the
compromise language. The key provision would require that guns have
enough metal to trigger an alarm set to pick up 3.7 ounces of
stainless steel.
   The NRA has supported a bill by Sen. Jim McClure, R-Idaho, which
would ban undetectable plastic weapons without setting a minimum
standard. McClure's approach, however, says that weapons must be
detectable by existing magnetometers.
   McClure, commenting on the compromise, said he believes the
proposal brings all sides closer together, although he stopped
short of an endorsement.
   But he added that if it would not ban any existing guns, there
would be little substantive difference between the two measures.
   ``What we were trying to make certain of is that this is a
detection bill and not a confiscation bill,'' McClure said.

<HEAD>Incontinence Needlessly Sends Elderly to Nursing Homes, Expert
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inability to control urinary function puts
millions of elderly Americans into nursing homes, even though
virtually all such patients can be helped with new medical
techniques, a researcher says.
   ``Help is available and more help is on the way'' for
incontinence, one of the most common and difficult problems for
aged Americans, said Dr. Alan J. Wein, professor of urology at the
University of Pennsylvania Hospital.
   Speaking at a seminar sponsored this week by the National Kidney
Foundation, Wein said half of the people in nursing homes are
unable to control their urine flow ``and many people are placed in
the homes simply because they are incontintent.''
   ``A recent estimate of direct and indirect cost of just
incontinence in the elderly exceeds $8 billion a year,'' he said.
   A spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association, which
represents the for-profit nursing home industry, said recent
studies actually show that more than half, 55 percent, of all
nursing home residents are incontinent.
   Linda Keegan, the spokeswoman, however, said the average nursing
home resident has four problems that are ``limitations to daily
living.''
   ``Incontinence may be the final factor to force the family to
put a person into a nursing home,'' Ms. Keegan said. Many families
cope successfully with problems such as feeding, bathing and
dressing an elderly relative, she said, but when incontinence is
added ``it may make it impossible to handle them at home.''
   Incontinence is a problem for a large number of people, both in
and out of nursing homes, Wein said.
   He said there are estimates that 1 percent to 2 percent of men
and 5 percent to 10 percent of women under age 65 suffer from the
problem. Among older Americans, the estimates are 6 percent for men
and 12 percent for women. And, for many, he said, incontinence is
``devastating.''
   ``They have to quit their jobs, restrict their activities and
stay at home to avoid embarrassment,'' he said.
   Only about one in five adults with urinary control problems seek
medical help, Wein said, and many who do are told by uninformed
physicians that nothing can be done.
   ``Many doctors regard incontinence as an inevitable consequence
of age,'' he said. ``But it is not. ... Virtually all forms of
incontinence are treatable.''
   Incontinence is such a widespread problem that the sale of
absorbent undergarments _ a type of adult diaper _ has become a
billion-dollar industry that uses national television ads as a
marketing tool, he said.
   ``The fact that urine collection is a billion-dollar industry is
a sad commentary'' because there now are innovative and successful
medical treatments to correct or improve the control of urinary
function, Wein said.
   Sophisticated new measuring techniques now can determine the
precise cause of incontinence, and this enables specialists to
apply a wide range of treatment techniques, he said.
   Wein said these include:
   _Scheduling. Simply voiding on a set, timed pattern can solve
some cases.
   _Biofeedback. This technique trains patients to use muscles to
help strengthen the uninary sphincter (a muscle that acts like a
valve) to control the flow.
   _Drugs. Medication to increase sphincter resistance and to
decrease bladder contractility have become ``extraordinarily
effective.''
   _Electrical stimulation. This system is under active study now
to improve the function of both the bladder and the urinary
sphincter.
   _Surgery. Although considered a last resort, surgical techniques
have improved significantly in recent years as a result of more
precise diagnosis. Ninty percent of women with ``stress
incontinence'' (an involuntary leakage while coughing, sneezing or
exercising) are cured with surgery. Improved techniques also are
solving most of the problems men have with urinary function as a
result of an enlarged prostate, Wein said.
   Use of an artificial urinary sphincter, when used appropriately,
is successful in 80 percent to 90 percent of the cases, Wein said.

<HEAD>School Racial Case Leads To Third Teacher Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOTHAN, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third teacher has been suspended as a
result of an investigation into the distribution of racist
materials at Northview High School, officials said.
   A black learning-disability teacher was suspended with pay
Monday after a week of investigations. Two white teachers, one who
taught algebra and one who taught psychology and sociology, were
suspended last Thursday.
   Superintendent Gene Watson did not identify the teachers by name
in a press release his office issued Tuesday. The specific
allegations that resulted in the suspensions were not disclosed.
   The problems at Northview surfaced April 18 shortly after
circulation of a supposed questionnaire for applicants for a
position on the staff of Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson. School officials described the questionnaire as racist and
derogatory.
   John S. Nettles, state Southern Christian Leadership Conference
president, said last Thursday parents wanted the suspended teachers
dismissed. He said more action would follow if they were not fired.
   The Rev. W.D. Daniels, coordinator for the Dothan-Wiregrass
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, said Tuesday night he hopes those involved ``in passing out
such a sick piece of literature and who would condone spreading
hate in that manner be punished to the full extent of the law.''

   The State Department entrusted millions of
dollars in travelers checks to poorly paid clerks who kept them in
unlocked cabinets and in stacks on the floor, resulting in an
operation so loose that $59,000 was embezzled and $307,780 has
disappeared, Congress was told Wednesday.
   Congressional investigators also told a House Government
Operations subcommittee that controls on State Department travel
advances were so disorganized that $15 million in such payments are
delinquent.
   That total includes a $695 advance to fired White House aide Lt.
Col. Oliver L. North, which is four years overdue.
   One committee member called the situation ``rotten ineptitude.''
Other officials said the State Department's focus on foreign policy
issues at the expense of management operations was to blame.
   Some of the names and Social Security numbers on the
travel-expense accounts appear to have been replaced with
fictitious names and Social Security numbers, the investigators
said.
   One delinquent traveler is recorded as ``Ludwig Van Beethoven,''
the investigators said.
   ``It seems to me the perpetrators even had a sense of humor in
conducting what amounted to criminal activity,'' said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich.
   Sherman N. Funk, the State Department's inspector general, said
the travelers check problem was uncovered after a surprise audit
last Aug. 21 of the department's principal cashier operations in
its headquarters building here.
   ``This audit was conducted as the result of an employee
embezzling and cashing $59,000 in travelers checks during the nine
days she worked in the cashier operation,'' Funk said.
   ``We found that an additional $307,780 in blank travelers checks
is missing'' but not yet cashed, he said.
   Funk testified that the department's principal cashier oversees
a constantly replenished $250,000 cash fund and an average $3
million in travelers checks. It annually disburses about $625,000
in cash and $22.7 million in travelers checks.
   But Ronald Spiers, undersecretary of state for management, said
cashiers are typically GS-3's _ one of the lowest federal job
grades _ and are poorly paid, making ``less than they could earn
working in a gasoline station.''
   Spiers said he had not been aware of the problem until reading
the inspector general's and General Accounting Office reports. He
said that because the department is focused on foreign policy
issues, ``management issues do not get the attention they deserve.''
   Funk added: ``I would like to emphasize that, in our opinion,
the most critical of all of the deficiencies noted ... was the
department's lack of concern with administrative support.''
   The inspector general's formal report, a copy of which was made
available to The Associated Press, said inspectors found there was
no inventory of travelers checks, no written operating procedures,
no controlled custody of funds, minimal physical security in the
cashier's office and improperly trained and supervised personnel.
   The cashier's operation was so disorganized that State
Department records could not be used to determine how much money
had been embezzled, the report said. Instead, investigators had to
rely on the records of Citicorp, the issuer of the checks.
   ``On Aug. 21, we observed travelers checks stored in an unlocked
supply cabinet and on the floor in the cashier's office,'' the
report said. ``All of the boxes of travelers checks (20 or more
boxes) had been opened and checks had been issued randomly out of
the boxes rather than a first-in, first-out system for issuance.''
   Investigators have not been able to learn if the $307,000 in
missing travelers checks were embezzled, misplaced, or accidentally
or intentionally destroyed, the report said.
   But it said that because the missing travelers checks are
negotiable, the State Department remains liable for the missing
amounts until the checks are accounted for.
   Some accountable department officers ``never knew that travelers
checks had almost the same vulnerability as cash,'' the report said.
   Frank Conahan, an assistant U.S. comptroller general, said a
General Accounting Office investigation showed the delinquent
travel advance situation is worse than it was two years ago, when
the department promised to correct it.
   The number of overdue or delinquent accounts rose from 8,100 in
1985 to 19,800 in 1987, with 300 accounts in excess of $10,000 and
two totaling $34,000 each, Conahan said.
   He said the total value of delinquent accounts rose from $10
million in 1985 to about $15.4 million last year.
   ``In testimony before the subcommittee in October 1985, the
State Department admitted that its travel operations were a mess
and promised prompt corrective behavior,'' said Rep. Jack Brooks,
D-Texas, the subcommittee chairman.
   ``Today we see the same rotten ineptitude,'' he added.

   Iran-Contra prosecutors have been unable to
obtain Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North's secret notebooks since
learning about their whereabouts from North's former secretary,
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said Wednesday.
   Walsh, testifying at a pre-trial hearing in the Iran-Contra
conspiracy case, said former National Security Council secretary
Fawn Hall reported seeing the notebooks in the office of North's
attorney, Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.
   ``Fawn Hall had seen the notebooks in your office and we were
trying to get you to admit that you had them or that Colonel North
had them,'' Walsh said under questioning by Sullivan.
   ``We subpoenaed you and tried to get the information; you
resisted,'' Walsh said.
   Ms. Hall, who was North's secretary at the NSC, is cooperating
with Walsh's investigation of the Iran-Contra affair under a grant
of immunity from prosecution.
   She is listed as a prospective trial witness against North,
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord. No date has been set for the trial.
   Walsh did not explain why his office was unable to obtain the
diaries.
   North's nearly 3,000 pages of diary entries are the subject of a
fresh subpoena issued this week by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee to assist a subcommittee probe of alleged drug
trafficking and money laundering.
   Subcommittee Chairman John Kerry, D-Mass., has said the
possibility exists that the Contra rebels profited from the drug
trade to finance the purchase of arms and supplies.
   The legal fight between Walsh and Sullivan is under court seal
because it relates to the grand jury investigation, but it is
presumed that Sullivan successfully invoked attorney-client
privilege in refusing to answer questions about the documents'
whereabouts.
   Walsh said his office had tried to determine if North had
possession of the documents ``so we could subpoena them.''
Prosecutors then learned from Fawn Hall that the notebooks were in
Sullivan's office, Walsh said.
   The congressional committees that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair were given censored versions of 1,269 pages of the 2,848
pages of North's diaries.
   Seventy-four heavily censored pages were released Tuesday by
Kerry. They were sprinkled with references to drugs, the Drug
Enforcement Administration and the CIA. Panamanian strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who is under U.S. indictment on drug
charges, was also mentioned.

<TEXT>
   A bomb hidden in a truck exploded in
downtown Kabul on Wednesday, the 10th anniversary of Afghanistan's
Communist revolution. The police commander said it killed six
people and wounded 49.
   Witnesses who arrived on the scene within 10 minutes reported
seeing three bodies and seven or eight wounded people being taken
away.
   The blast at 12:40 p.m. shattered windows in a two-block area.
The truck had been left in a parking strip along the Kabul River.
Its charred chassis was hurled over a low wall and landed on the
gravel bank below.
   Brig. Gen. Saifullah, the Kabul police commander, blamed Moslem
guerrillas based in Pakistan, who have been fighting since the
communist coup.
   Speaking to foreign journalists seven hours after the blast, the
police commander displayed what he described as a Pakistani license
plate from the truck.
   ``The address of the driver of the truck and the owner of the
truck have been found out,'' he said. ``They are Afghan nationals.''
   He said no arrests had been made and the investigation was
continuing.
   Saifullah said the license plate, number PRD 7675, was found
near the remains of the truck.
   All the dead were pedestrians _ four men a woman and a young
girl _ and 27 of the wounded were hospitalized, he said.
   The truck blew up in the Pamira district of commercial buildings
and apartment houses with shops on the ground floors. Nearly every
window was shattered in a 13-story building 300 yards from
explosion.
   Saifullah said the number of bombings in the capital had
declined in the year ending March 20.
   He said 10 or 11 bombings occurrd in the 12-month period, but
Western sources said earlier this week they counted 22 bombs in
Kabul in March alone and 10 in February.
   According to Saifullah, the year's bombings killed about 35
people and wounded five or 10. That reverses the usual death and
injury ratio in bombings.
   The Western sources, speaking privately, said car bombings had
increased in Kabul while the number of rocket attacks by guerrillas
was declining.
   Attacks did not slacken after the signing April 14 in Geneva of
an accord under which the Soviet Union will begin withdrawing its
estimated 115,000 soldiers from Afghanistan by May 15, the sources
said.
   Security in Kabul was tightened this week because of
preparations for the Soviet withdrawal and celebrations of the coup
April 27, 1978, in which President Mohammad Daoud was killed and a
government backed by the Kremlin was installed. Soviet troops
entered the country in December 1979.
   Police checkpoints stopped cars Tuesday, when a military parade
was held, to inspect trunks and glove compartments and check
undercarriages, but such precautions were less frequent Wednesday.

Wednesday.
   The widely respected broadcaster also announced it will create
four new reporting teams to focus on business and economics, social
issues, foreign affairs and politics. They will contribute to four
new weekly television programs on those topics beginning in the
fall.
   The BBC will also open a television bureau in Paris in the fall,

   Democrats chose former Philadelphia

John Heinz, and picked a backer of political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche in a U.S. House primary.
   The results of Tuesday's primary in suburban Philadelphia's 5th
Congressional District left Democrats embarrassed, and the stunned
loser declared Wednesday that ``people better wake up.''
   The LaRouche follower, Drexel Hill sales representative Donald
Hadley, edged businessman Robert W. Houchins in a contest to
determine which would challenge GOP Rep. Richard Schulze in
November.
   Houchins said Wednesday that voters were not paying attention.
   ``I feel some of the people in the party did not take Donald
Hadley seriously enough. The LaRouche threat is very real,'' he
said.
   Most voters, Houchins said, ``don't care about what happens in
this country. Charles Manson could run for office and get elected.''
   Former district justice Mitchell G. Crane of West Chester said
Hadley's victory ``shows the weakness of the Democratic
organization in the three counties. It is a disgrace.''
   LaRouche is a presidential candidate who promulgates bizarre
theories, including support for quarantining AIDS victims and
charging that the queen of England is a drug dealer.
   With 99 percent of the votes counted, Hadley had 10,667, or 53
percent, and Houchins 9,298, or 47 percent.
   In the statewide Senate primary, Vignola did not win by as wide
a margin as had been expected. Endorsed by the Democratic State
Committee, he raised some $200,000 to $5,000 for opponent Susan
Sullivan Kefover, a two-term commissioner in rural Potter County.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Vignola had 490,079
votes or 45 percent, Kefover had 371,722 or 34 percent, Steven
Douglas of suburban Philadelphia, another follower of LaRouche, had
146,050 votes or 13 percent. and had 74,843 votes or 7 percent and
Villanova University professor John Logue had 74,843 votes or 7
percent .
   Lowman Henry, field director of the Republican State Committee,
said Vignola's modest showing foreshadowed a big victory for Heinz.
   ``When an unendorsed county commissioner can get that many
votes, it shows that he (Vignola) is not well known. We're looking
for John Heinz to be a big boost to the Republican ticket.''
   Pennsylvania voters also overwhelmingly approved a ballot
question that will clear a $300 million bond issue to underwrite a
program cleaning up the state's water and sewer systems.
Pennsylvania has been leading the nation recently in outbreaks of
water-borne diseases.

<HEAD>PTL Requests Review of IRS Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEG REYNOLDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PTL has asked a federal claims court in
Washington to review a decision by the Internal Revenue Service to
revoke its tax-exempt status, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   David West, PTL spokesman, said the appeal delays an IRS
decision last week that lifted the troubled television ministry's
tax-free status, making contributions no longer tax deductible.
   Until the review is completed, donations of up to $1,000 may be
claimed as federal income tax deductions, West said in a telephone
interview from Heritage USA, the ministry's theme park in Fort
Mill, S.C.
   ``Anyone who gives money and deducts it won't be asked (by the
IRS) for money back,'' he said.
   However, a staff member in the IRS regional office in Atlanta,
referring to a statement prepared on the case by IRS spokesman Les
Witmer, said past contributions by PTL supporters will remain fully
deductible until April 22 _ the date of the revocation.
   In revoking PTL's tax-free status, the IRS cited its own report
last December which concluded that Jim and Tammy Bakker and their
aides profited excessively from donations made to the ministry.
   The revocation extends back to 1981. If allowed to stand, the
financially troubled ministry will also owe taxes on proceeds from
Heritage USA, much of which the IRS ruled came from commercial,
rather than ministerial, operations.
   West said the ministry would argue in claims court that if PTL's
tax-exempt status is lifted, the decision should apply only to the
years in which the Bakkers controlled the ministry, from 1981
through 1987.
   Moreover, he said PTL, which is undergoing reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, was expecting a decision
in federal bankruptcy court on its application for a new,
non-profit ministry.
   If that status is granted, the new ministry would not be held
responsible for debts of the old one, he said.
   IRS spokesman Witmer was attending a meeting in Washington
Wednesday afternoon and could not be reached by telephone for
comment, said the IRS staff member, who asked not to be identified.
   West said he was unsure whether news reports of the IRS decision
were affecting contributions to the ministry.
   ``It'll be about 10 days _ it takes that long for mails to come
in and (for PTL to) see if there's been an impact,'' West said.

<HEAD>Radio Station Decides To Give Windfall To Area Charities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he asked listeners to send in $20 for no
particular reason, disc jockey Ron Chapman hardly expected the
total would reach $243,120. Now five charities are going to get the
windfall.
   Chapman asked his radio listeners to send him the money on March
31 as an experiment.
   Station officials, stunned when about 12,000 people responded
within four days, decided Tuesday to give most of the money to
charity.
   Hundreds of listeners helped station officials figure out what
to do with the money, and hundreds more wanted some of the money
for themselves.
   Suggestions ranged from pleas for funding for organ-transplant
candidates to a request by Lawrence Welk fans to rebuild his
birthplace in North Dakota.
   ``I think we made some wonderful choices, but I'm glad it's
over,'' said Chapman. ``It's very rewarding for all of us.
   ``Now, I think I'd like to get back to what we're supposed to be
doing _ that's having fun on the air,'' said Chapman.
   The Salvation Army will receive about $100,000 to rebuild a
warehouse in Dallas.
   A Fort Worth shelter for women and children who are victims of
domestic violence will receive $16,000 to buy a vehicle.
   The Tarrant County Food Bank will get $56,000 to buy a
``heavy-duty, refrigerated, bobtail truck with power-lift
tailgate,'' said Chapman, program manager and morning disc jockey
of radio station KVIL-FM, in a letter to those who sent in money.
   ``We are ecstatic,'' said Pat Mohler, the Tarrant County food
bank's director. ``We need this truck so badly. Our truck driver is
walking two feet off the ground.''
   Even after the contributions, there is still more than $43,000
waiting to be distributed. And several thousand dollars was spent
to mail letters to listeners explaining how the money will be used,
said Chapman.

   A student who was about to graduate from
Brown University has been expelled for embezzling $19,800 from a
campus organization, officials said Wednesday.
   The student, whose name was not released, was a former officer
of Brown Student Agencies, a student-run business that sells
appliances and provides laundry services on campus, said John
Robinson, dean of students at the Ivy League school.
   Using his access to the organization's books, the student stole
$9,800 in October 1985 but returned it 15 days later and altered
the records to cover it up, Robinson said.
   In February 1986, the student stole $10,000 from the business
and invested it in a money market account. He returned the money,
with interest, when confronted by the organization's executive
board 15 months later, Robinson said.
   Robinson said that a faculty discipline committee has been
investigating the situation since then to make sure no other
students were involved. It was this committee that expelled the
student.
   Brown Student Agencies receives no money from the university and
is run by students with some oversight by the university's staff.
It is intended to provide jobs for students and pays them a salary.
It also is meant to be a pofit-making organization, but rarely is,
students say.
   Robinson said he did not know how the student was able to
manipulate such large sums without the knowledge of others.
   David Popowitz, a junior who is president of the organization,
said new procedures have been instituted to ensure that the thefts
are not repeated.

<HEAD>Bayh, Dukakis Favored To Win Indiana Primaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unless a court decision strikes him from the
ballot, Secretary of State Evan Bayh is favored to win the
Democratic nomination for governor next Tuesday and stage a strong
bid to break Indiana Republicans' 20-year hold on the office.
   In the presidential primary, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
is expected to defeat Jesse Jackson in the Democratic race, and
Vice President George Bush, who sewed up the GOP nomination this
week with his win in Pennsylvania, faces no active opposition in
the Republican contest.
   Republican Sen. Richard G. Lugar is unopposed for nomination for
a third term. He will face Indianapolis attorney Jack Wickes, a
former campaign staffer for Gary Hart, in November. Wickes is
unopposed in the Democratic primary.
   Bayh, the 32-year-old son of former three-term Sen. Birch E.
Bayh, held a 7-to-1 advantage over former Kokomo Mayor Stephen J.
Daily in recent opinion polls. He also led his probable GOP
opponent in the November election.
   But there is still the question of the state Supreme Court
ruling on Bayh's residency, which could come any time.
   The court is reviewing a Shelby County Circuit Court decision
that found that Bayh meets the five-year residency requirement for
a governor even though he lived in Washington, D.C., while working
as an attorney in 1983 and 1984.
   Circuit Judge Charles D. O'Connor ruled that Bayh maintained his
ties to his native state during his absence and always intended to
return to Indiana.
   The Republican-controlled State Election Board appealed the
ruling, arguing for a strict interpretation of the constitutional
residency requirement.
   Bayh initiated the court case after retiring GOP Gov. Robert D.
Orr instructed the election board to investigate Bayh's residency.
Bayh claimed he couldn't get a fair hearing before the board and
charged that Republicans were trying to deny voters a choice in the
election.
   ``We have a political dynasty here of 20 years, and they see the
real possibility the power will slip through their fingers and
they're willing to do about anything to keep that from happening,''
said Bayh, who would be the state's youngest in this century and
third-youngest in history.
   A recent Indianapolis Star poll showed Bayh leading Daily by 70
percent to 11 percent. He also leads two-term Lt. Gov. John M.
Mutz, who is unopposed in the GOP gubernatorial primary, by a 48-33
margin.
   Orr, who is retiring because he is limited to two terms under
the state Constitution, said he wants the Supreme Court to rule so
there will be no lingering doubts about Bayh's eligibility.
   Mutz initially supported the residency challenge but said after
the first ruling that he wished the case wouldn't be appealed so
the campaign could focus on other issues.
   A 20-year veteran of the General Assembly and executive branch,
Mutz said the real issue is Bayh's lack of experience. He also
questions Bayh's performance as secretary of state since taking
office after defeating Robert O. Bowen, son of former governor and
Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, in 1986.
   ``Who is ready now for Indiana's toughest job?'' said Mutz, a
52-year-old former Indianapolis businessman. ``I would submit that
one of the first things you have to look at in that respect is our
demonstrated ability to perform, our demonstrated ability to get
results. Results, not rhetoric.''
   In a reference to Bayh's age, Mutz said, ``We're not talking
about electing somebody class president here.''
   Bayh replies that he would take office at 33, which was Sen. Dan
Quayle's age when he joined the Senate after defeating Bayh's
father in 1980.
   ``Age is not relevant,'' Bayh said. ``It's ability. It's ideas.
It's where you hope to lead Indiana.''
   The governor's office ``is not just some kind of gold watch that
someone is awarded after 20 years of service,'' Bayh said.
   Mutz has promised to continue Orr's commitment to improving
schools and attracting new jobs to the state. As lieutenant
governor, Mutz has headed the state's economic development efforts.
   Bayh counters that the Orr-Mutz administration has brought
Indiana its two largest tax increases in history.
   Also on the Democratic gubernatorial ballot is Senate Minority
Leader Frank L. O'Bannon, Bayh's choice for lieutenant governor.
The Bayh campaign decided to put O'Bannon on the ballot as a
precautionary move in case Bayh is ruled ineligible.

<HEAD>Iran-Saudi Split Will Deepen U.S. Gulf Involvement, Diplomats Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's split with Tehran will
heighten Iran's isolation in the Arab world and likely deepen U.S.
involvement in the Persian Gulf region, Arab diplomats said
Wednesday.
   One Arab ambassador, speaking on condition of anonymity, also
said the Saudis took a calculated risk by severing relations with
Iran because of the potential for retaliatory attacks against the
oil-rich kingdom and its allies.
   Soon after the ambassador spoke, a bomb exploded outside the
Saudi national airline office in neighboring Kuwait, wounding a
guard, Kuwaiti officials reported.
   The pro-Western Saudis cited Iranian ``terrorism and
subversion'' when they announced the break Tuesday on state-run
media.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, broadcast a statement by
Iran's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday that blamed Saudi Arabian
cooperation with U.S. ``conspiracies in the Persian Gulf'' for the
Saudi move.
   It also accused Saudi Arabia of providing ``enormous financial
aid'' for Iraq, its foe in the 7{-year-old gulf war.
   ``The break of diplomatic relations is occurring at the same
time as the aggressions of America in the Persian Gulf and prove
that America is governing (Saudi Arabia),'' Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi was quoted as saying in a later broadcast.
   Iraq called the Saudi move a ``logical and brave decision.''
   The Saudi split comes on the heels of two major setbacks for the
Iranians.
   On April 18, U.S. warships and planes sank or crippled at least
six Iranian naval vessels. The previous day, the Iraqis recaptured
the southern Faw peninsula, which the Iranians overran in February
1986.
   Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said King
Fahd's government consulted with the United States before severing
relations with Tehran.
   The United States on Wednesday denied Iranian accusations that
it pressured Saudi Arabia to make the move.
   But Arab diplomats said Washington is ``tacitly committed to
defend Saudi Arabia,'' the Americans' main friend and ally in the
Arab world.
   ``The U.S. will find itself more involved than ever before in
the gulf region, and we do not exclude anti-Iranian military
deterrent action by the U.S. Navy,'' one said.
   ``After all, the United States has come to regard Iran as
expendable. Besides, the growing Saudi flirtation with Moscow
cannot be overlooked.''
   He said the imminent withdrawal of Soviet forces from
Afghanistan will open the door for the Soviets to establish ties
with Saudi Arabia and perhaps play a wider role in the gulf.
   In its statement cutting ties to Iran, the Saudis criticized
Tehran for a July 31 riot by Iranian pilgrims in the holy Moslem
city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the subsequent ransacking of the
Saudi Embassy in Tehran, and attacks on merchant ships in the gulf,
many of them owned by or trading with Saudi Arabia.
   Saudi Arabia, seeking to avoid more bloodshed during this year's
pilgrimage, sought to limit the mumber of pilgrims and asked Iran
to cut its usual turnout of 150,000 by about one-third.
   Despite the break, the Saudi ambassador in Turkey said 45,000
Iranian pilgrims would be allowed to make the pilgrimage this
summer.
   The Iranians have said they will send 150,000 and also defy a
Saudi ban on political demonstrations.
   One Manama-based Arab ambassador said the basic thrust of the
Saudi move was to avoid a recurrence of the Mecca violence in
which, by Saudi count, 402 pilgrims were killed.
   ``Although the principle of severing diplomatic ties is very
much against the Saudis' nature, many of us think it was long
overdue, in view of the fact that Saudi patience with Iran was
wearing thin,'' said the ambassador, who insisted on anonymity.
   After the Mecca riots, Iran called for the overthrow of the
Saudi royal family.
   On Sunday, an armed Iranian speedboat rocketed a Saudi-owned
tanker, the Sea Trader, in the Strait of Hormuz. That came only
hours after President Reagan warned Iran it would suffer ``very
costly'' consequences if it did not stop raiding neutral ships in
the gulf.
   ``It's obvious the United States is getting sick and tired of
Iran, as are the Saudis, the Kuwaitis and other powers in the
gulf,'' said one Arab diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Kuwait, its shipping under constant attack by Iran, turned to
the United States for protection last year and reflagged 11 of its
tankers with the Stars and Stripes.
   Kuwait also has accused Iran of complicity in the April 5
hijacking of a Kuwait Airways jetliner in which two Kuwaitis were
killed.

   A magazine poll to be published Thursday says
Socialist President Francois Mitterrand will beat conservative

runoff.
   The Paris Match survey was the first published since Sunday's
opening round of the election, which Mitterrand won with 34 percent

   Former center-right Premier Raymond Barre was third with 17
percent, and extreme right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
had 14 percent.
   The poll, which was obtained in an advance copy of the magazine
Wednesday, said 20 percent of those who voted for Barre would vote
for Mitterrand in the runoff. It said 31 percent of Le Pen voters
would cross over to the left.
   The poll also said 11 percent of voters were undecided.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday named new
leaders for the Roman Catholic church in the Soviet republic of
Lithuania.
   The pope appointed a new president of the Lithuanian episcopal
conference and a new apostolic administrator in Kaunas.
   The new president of the episcopal conference is Monsignor
Vincentas Sladkevicius, 68, who has been apostolic administrator
since 1983 in Kaisiadorys. From 1963 to 1982, Soviet authorities
prevented him from performing his religious duties in Kaisiadorys,
according to the Vatican.
   The new apostolic administrator for Kaunas is Monsignor Juozas
Preiksas, 62.
   The changes follow resignation of Monsignor Liudas Povilonis as
head of the espiscopal conference and the Kaunas Diocese. The
Vatican said Povilonis, 78, resigned due to bad health.
   Earlier this month, the pope repeated an appeal for religious
freedom in Lithuania during a visit of the republic's church
leaders to Rome. He referred to ``profound hardships'' of the
Lithuanian church but said there were ``winds of renewal'' in the
Soviet Union.
   At least 2 million of Lithuania's 3.5 million people are Roman
Catholics. The Soviet Union occupied independent Lithuania in 1940,
and it still is viewed as a stronghold of nationalism and
anti-Soviet sentiment.

   A project to produce eyeglasses with miniature
color TV screens instead of lenses to help people with low vision
is a spinoff from the development of space stations, researchers
said Wednesday.
   The system is expected to provide clearer and more defined
vision than can be produced by conventional eye treatment. It may
help an estimated 2.5 million people whose vision can't be improved
by other means.
   The device will not restore sight to those who are completely
blind, or improve nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism,
researchers at Johns Hopkins' Wilmer Eye Institute said at a news
conference to announce the project. But it will enhance what vision
is left in people who suffer from degenerative eye disease, they
said.
   Wilmer and NASA's National Space Technology Laboratories will
spend $5 million in the next five years to develop the system, said
Robert Massof, a Hopkins ophthalmology professor working on the
project.
   Ray Gilbert, manager of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's technology applications engineering section, said
the system comes from research that helped create space stations.
   ``We can use that technology ... to enhance life on earth for a
person with low vision,'' Gilbert said.
   ``It is recognizing an image through a software program and
applying those kinds of principles to the low-vision device,''
Gilbert said.
   The device would be used by people who have poor vision as a
result of diabetes, aging and other causes.
   It would not only magnify and enhance images, but be able to
zoom in on an object or distort it, to improve the sight of people
with tunnel vision, Massof said.
   ``They will not look through the screens, but at the screens,''
Massof said. ``For a long time the only thing that's been done for
people with low vision is provide them with a magnifier. With the
technology (available), we (believed) we could do more than simply
enlarge it.''
   NASA scientists will adapt the technology for the glasses, while
researchers at Wilmer will determine what the system has to do to
alter a patient's vision, Massof said.
   The device would resemble wrap-around sunglasses with small
lenses in the frames, connected by optical fibers to a
battery-powered computer at the waist, Massof said.
   The lenses would capture the field of vision, and images would
be conveyed to miniature solid-state television cameras in the
waist pack, he said. The images would be processed by the computer
and displayed on the color television screens where the lenses
would be.
   ``The breakthrough is the technology that made this all
possible,'' Massof said. ``We are not creating new components for
this.'' However the existing technology will have to be
miniaturized and refined, he said, and researchers have set a goal
of completing that work in five years.
   About 11 million Americans have vision defects that cannot be
corrected. The glasses could benefit about 2.5 million people who
suffer from severe, disabling impairment, or low vision, said Dr.
Arnall Patz, director of the eye institute.
   Those who would be helped by the glasses ``are still potentially
productive people. They can probably get around but are unable to
read ... recognize faces, or things may be very reduced in
contrast, so they look somewhat blank,'' Massof said.
   ``For the patient who has reduction in sensitivity to contrasts
_ where blacks and whites look gray _ we can sharpen up the
contrast and make blacks much blacker, whites much whiter,'' he
said.
   He could not say what it would cost, but said the eyeglasses
could be assembled for less than $1,000. ``It will be of no value
unless it is made affordable for the person who is retired and on a
fixed income,'' he said.
   Researchers hope it would qualify for insurance coverage as a
rehabilitative device, he said.

<HEAD>Iran Did Not Use Silkworm Missiles Against U.S. Ships, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has concluded that Iran did not
fire any of its large Silkworm missiles against Navy ships during
last week's Persian Gulf fighting, defense officials said Wednesday.
   The officials, who spoke only on condition they not be named,
stressed that Pentagon analysts were not disputing that missiles of
some type had been fired by Iran against the destroyers Joseph
Strauss and O'Brien and the frigate Jack Williams.
   ``There were missiles fired, which our ships successfully
evaded,'' one source said. ``But there are strong indicators they
weren't Silkworms.''
   While nailing down what type of missiles were fired might seem
academic, the defense sources said the matter had been
``exhaustively investigated.''
   They explained that any evidence proving Silkworms had been
fired would demonstrate that Iran was raising the military stakes
in the gulf. The Silkworm, a Chinese-built version of an old
Russian anti-ship missile, is the most powerful missile in the
Iranian arsenal even though it has a fairly rudimentary guidance
system, the sources said.
   Most of the Silkworms believed purchased by Iran are designed to
be fired from mobile ground launchers, the sources continued,
meaning their use would suggest Iran intends to go beyond reliance
on gunboats to attack commercial shipping.
   The United States has pledged to destroy any Silkworm battery if
it uncovers evidence a missile is about to be fired.
   The question of the Silkworm's use arose in the aftermath of the
fighting that erupted April 18 after the navy destroyed two
offshore Iranian platforms in retaliation for the mining of the
frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts.
   Six Iranian ships were crippled or sunk during a wave of
fighting that erupted around the southern gulf after those attacks
on the two platforms. During the confrontation, the Williams,
Strauss and O'Brien _ operating in the Strait of Hormuz _ were
fired upon with missiles they monitored electronically and which
crewmen described to reporters as Silkworms.
   The defense sources refused to discuss all of the ``strong
indicators'' that showed the missiles were not Silkworms. One
official did say, however, that all known Silkworm launch sites on
the coast of Iran and the naval base at Bandar Abbas where the
weapons are stored had been under ``constant surveillance'' during
the fighting.
   ``If they had moved one out, we would have seen it,'' the
official said.
   Another source disclosed there was some evidence a Silkworm
might have been fired that day during fighting on the ground at the
northern end of the gulf, along the Faw peninsula. Iraqi forces
staged a successful ground offensive to retake that area from Iran
as the naval battles raged in the southern gulf.
   ``There was one long-range electronic sighting up north during
the battle for Al Faw that could have been a Silkworm,'' the source
said.
   ``But we've pretty exhaustively investigated what happened in
the gulf and reached the conclusion that no Silkworms were fired at
us.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet broadcasting executives refused to air a
U.S.-produced television report exploring parallels in the problems
of men who fought in Vietnam and Afghanistan, an American TV
journalist said Wednesday.
   Jean Enersen, an anchor from KING-TV in Seattle, said the
program had been scheduled for Wednesday's television program ``120
Minutes'' as one of five U.S.-produced reports to be shown this
week on that show.
   The segment featured Glen Webster, a veteran of the Vietnam War
from Snohomish, Wash., ``who talked about the problems caused by
the war, including drug addiction, suicidal tendencies and
alcoholism,'' said Enersen.
   Enersen, with a Soviet crew, interviwed several Soviet veterans
from Afghanistan to seek their comments for the report to be shown
on state-run TV.
   However, she said she was told on Tuesday by Pavel Korchagin, a
producer in the foreign relations department of the Soviet
broadcasting authority Gostelradio, that the segment would not be
broadcast.
   ``He said it would cause too much pain for the Soviet people,
and that they're not ready to start dealing with these issues,''
Enersen said of Korchagin.
   Instead, another report prepared by Enersen and her crew about
economic reforms in the Soviet consumer sector was broadcast
Wednesday, she said.
   She also said the Soviet veterans she spoke to were less than
forthcoming in their comments about social and readjustment
problems caused by the Afgahn war.
   ``They were not interested in discussing those issues, and the
Soviet government was not interested in broadcasting those issue,''
she said.
   Enersen said she had been invited to Moscow to film reports on
any five topics she chose, to be broadcast on ``120 Minutes'' and
accompanied by her live commentary.
   It was believed to be the first time a U.S. journalist had been
allowed to give live commentary on Soviet TV, and a clear
manifestation of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness.
   However, glasnost has only been spottily applied by the
state-run media to the Soviet military involvement in Afghanistan,
and covernment officials have never said how many Soviet soldiers
have died there or even how many are fighting.
   ``Glasnost obviously has its limits and we just found one of
them,'' said KING news director Don Varyu, speaking in Seattle.
``We were very clear going in that they (Gosteleradio) would not
exercise veto power over the selection of topics or how those
sujects were handled and they did not. But they have exercised an
editor's prerogative not to `print.'''
   Other pieces prepared by Enersen for broadcast on Soviet TV
dealt with glasnost, economic cooperatives and educational reform.
   She said she was seeking another subject to fill the void caused
by the cancellation of the segment on Afghan and Vietnam veterans.
   The reports being shown on ``120 Minutes'' are being broadcast
the same day during KING-TV's evening news broadcast, she said.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a clear day in Crete, the myth of
Daedalus and the reality of Kanellos Kanellopoulos drew uncannily
close.
   Daedulus was a mythical Greek hero who built wings from wax and
feathers and flew across the Aegean Sea. His son, Icarus, tried to
soar to the sun and fell into the sea.
   Kanellopoulos is a real Greek hero, a champion bicyclist who
likes to draw pictures of birds. On April 23, flying a fragile
airplane powered by pedals pushed by his powerful legs, he
duplicated Daedalus' feat.
   He flew farther than anyone else in a human-powered plane. But,
like Icarus, he has his sights on a goal he considers much loftier
than flying from one place to another.
   Two days after his feat, the tall, laconic Greek was training
for the Olympics in Seoul.
   ``It's true (the flight) was something different, but what I've
really wanted all along is to win a place for the Olympics,'' he
said.
   ``I was just lucky ... lucky to have my turn as pilot that day,
and lucky to accomplish the flight.''
   Kanellopoulos, a Greek cycling champion for 14 years and a
specialist in endurance events, has a reputation for coolness that
showed at the end of the 74-mile flight from Crete to Santorini.
   When the plane _ the Daedalus 88 _ crashed in the sea just 10
yards offshore, he stayed calm.
   ``I knew the job was done, so I unhooked my pedal clips and just
walked through the wreckage to the beach,'' he said.
   The 72-pound aircraft, built of hi-tech fiber compounds and
ultra-thin plastic sheeting, collapsed on impact.
   Kanellopoulos' flight took just three hours, 54 minutes at an
average speed of 18{ mph. It broke the record of 37.2 miles for
human-powered flight, set in January 1987 by Glenn Tremml, who
powered a Daedalus 88 prototype around Edward Air Force Base in
California. It also broke Bryan Allen's 1979 straight-line record
of 22{ miles across the English Channel.
   ``Kanellos is a really good athlete. By the end of the flight he
had his heart rate way down and he could have gone almost double
the distance,'' said Steve K. Bussolari, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology expert on human aerospace factors who headed flight
operations for the project.
   Kanellopoulos, who turned 31 two days after the flight, joined a
group of four American athlete-pilots in the United States last
year on the final six-month training period for the MIT project.
   ``He was exactly the right kind of athlete, a long-duration
cyclist who could produce a lot of power for his weight, and I
judged he had the temperament for a project that took patience,''
Bussolari said.
   For Kanellopoulos, human-powered flying was a challenge that
could be combined with his Olympic preparations.
   ``Learning to fly wasn't hard. And the training program wasn't
so different from what I was planning to do in Greece,'' he said.
   The other pilots described Kanellopoulos as a dedicated athlete
who quickly learned to handle the delicate Daedalus prototypes,
despite his 6-foot-2, 158-pound frame.
   ``Kanellos speaks good English and he learned real fast. He's
the biggest and strongest of us, and he sometimes had to ease off
the power so he didn't break the plane,'' said Tremml, 27, from New
Haven, Conn., one of the plane's pilots.
   ``Kanellos likes to play the cool tough guy, but I could see how
his knees were trembling when he was sitting in the plane waiting
to take off,'' Tremml added.
   In Athens, Kanellopoulos, a high-school physical education
teacher who works for the government sports secretariat, lives in a
small apartment at the Athens Olympic Stadium village.
   The Daedalus flight is unlikely to add to his renown.
   His gold medals at two successive Mediterranean Games were a
rare achievement for this small nation, which doesn't have the
resources to produce world-class sportsmen, despite its ancient
athletic tradition.
   Like many modern Greeks, Kanellopoulos takes the ancient glories
for granted.
   ``I first learned the Daedalus legend as a kid at school, but
then we're born with ancient ruins and mythology and we live with
them all the time, so they don't give us such strong feelings, ''
he said.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Jailing In Child-Support Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, upholding a practice used
in most states, ruled Wednesday that parents who fail to pay
court-ordered child support may be jailed even if their ability to
pay is not proved.
   By an 8-0 vote, the justices said citing such parents for civil
contempt and jailing them until they pay does not violate
constitutionally protected due-process rights.
   But the court said a finding of criminal contempt, which also
can spark a jail sentence, would be unconstitutional without proof
the parent is able to pay the child support.
   Sally Goldfarb, a lawyer for the National Organization for
Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, called the decision an
``important victory'' because in most states such contempt
proceedings ``are clearly civil.''
   ``One reason that contempt is such an important tool is that
there are many absent fathers who are unwilling to meet their legal
and moral obligations to their children unless they are threatened
with jail,'' Ms. Goldfarb said.
   ``Many parents who claim they don't have a dollar to spare for
child support suddenly come up with thousands of dollars once the
jail cell door closes behind them,'' she said.
   In most states, court orders withholding wages of parents
delinquent in making child-support payments are becoming
increasingly available. But Ms. Goldfarb said ``jail is a
particularly powerful remedy'' against self-employed parents or
those able to hide their financial assets.
   In another decision, the court raised the possibility that
states may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired for using
illegal drugs during religious ceremonies.
   The justices ordered Oregon courts to determine whether two men
who used the hallucinogenic drug peyote during Native American
religious ceremonies may have a right to unemployment benefits.
   The child-support ruling sent back to state courts a California
case in which five justices could not determine whether a divorced
father had been held in civil or criminal contempt.
   Philip and Alta Sue Feiock were divorced in Orange County,
Calif., in 1976. As part of the divorce judgment, Feiock was
ordered to pay $150 a month in child support for his three children.
   After Feiock failed to make any payments, a state judge ruled he
was in contempt of court and gave him a 25-day suspended jail
sentence. Feiock was placed on three years probation and ordered to
begin making the child-support payments or be jailed.
   A state appeals court threw out Feiock's contempt citation,
ruling that the state's child-support law creates an
unconstitutional ``mandatory presumption'' that a parent is able to
make the payments _ thus relieving prosecutors of proving that fact.
   In sending the case back to the California courts, Justice Byron
R. White said the high court is uncertain whether Feiock was cited
for civil or criminal contempt.
   Under civil contempt, a person is jailed until complying with a
court order. Criminal contempt is punishment and normally involves
a specific jail term unrelated to compliance with the court order.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor and Antonin Scalia, although agreeing with White that
civil contempt may be imposed without a finding of ability to pay,
voted to reinstate Feiock's contempt citation. They said his
proceeding clearly was civil, not criminal.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy did not participate in the case.

<TEXT>
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward, who had
called on Mayor Edward I. Koch to apologize for his remarks on
Jesse Jackson, said Wednesday he was satisfied with the mayor's
explanation _ even though Koch refused to call it an apology.
   Ward, a Koch appointee who is the top black official in the
city, added that Koch is ``an outstanding mayor'' and vowed to put
the matter behind him.
   On Tuesday, Ward denounced Koch's blistering criticism of
Jackson as ``divisive'' and said the mayor should apologize.
   But he said Wednesday he had since learned that Koch said in
Washington he was ``sorry'' that the stridency of his remarks
during the New York Democratic presidential primary campaign had
offended some Jackson followers. Koch also wrote a letter of
explanation of his criticism to The New York Times.
   Koch said in the letter, ``It was never my intent to draw
political lines with racial or religious borders.''
   When asked at a news conference on an unrelated matter if he was
satisfied with Koch's remarks, Ward said, ``absolutely.''
   ``I'm not one to look back.'' he added. ``I'm not going to look
back. I think we ought to go forward.''
   Koch was asked if his letter was an apology to Jackson.
   ``I'm not characterizing it,'' he said. He said he would let his
letter speak for itself.
   Asked about his relationship with Ward, Koch said, ``He's one of
the great police commissioners. He is a very great friend of mine.
There is no breach between us. If anything, I suspect maybe the
relationship is stronger.''
   Koch had criticized Jackson's stand on Israel and said Jews and
other supporters of that nation would be ``crazy'' to vote for him.

<HEAD>Group Says Reagan To Press Religious Freedom at Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group urging religious freedom in the Soviet
Union said Wednesday it had assurances from President Reagan that
he would press the issue at his summit with Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   At a White House meeting Monday, the group gave Reagan a
petition signed by 240 prominent Americans urging wider religious
freedom as the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates its 1,000th
anniversary.
   The petition, released at a news conference Wednesday, is
addressed to Gorbachev. Its publication was financed by the James
Madison Foundation, a private research group which says it is
dedicated to world peace and against communism.
   George Weigel, president of the foundation, said Reagan assured
him ``that he would, indeed, make our cause part of the summit
agenda.''
   The petition says ``human rights issues, and paramount among
them the fundamental human right of religious freedom or freedom of
conscience, are not peripheral matters on the U.S.-Soviet agenda,''
Weigel said.
   White House aides said the petition may be presented to Soviet
officials during the May 29-June 2 summit, though probably not
personally by the president. Earlier this week, Reagan said in a
speech that irritated Gorbachev that the Soviets could ``never have
truly normal relations'' with the United States as long as it
violated human rights.
   The petition calls for recognition of religious organizations,
legalization of the Greek Catholic (Ukrainian Catholic) Church,
freedom to teach religion to children, emigration for believers and
a general amnesty for all ``religious prisoners of conscience.''
   It is signed by people from a broad range of religious and
political opinion, including members of Congress, educators,
journalists and religious organizations.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Group Criticizes Forced Merger of Black Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights activists said
Wednesday they expect ``severe conflict'' because of a government
decision to get around a court ruling and merge of two black
communities.
   The Transvaal Rural Action Committee also protested the
designation of Oukasie, a 55-year-old black township, as an
``emergency camp'' governed by strict new regulations. It depicted
Tuesday's declaration as an attempt to demoralize the people of
Oukasie, who have resisted efforts to force them out.
   Activists thought the merger dispute was resolved last month
when South Africa's highest court said President P.W. Botha
exceeded his authority by incorporating the 120,000-member
community of Moutse into the adjoining homeland of KwaNdebele on
Dec. 31, 1985.
   Scores of people in Moutse were killed in fighting that followed
the incorporation.
   Chris Heunis, the constitutional development minister, revived
the issue Tuesday by saying the government would introduce
legislation to circumvent the ruling so the incorporation could
proceed. He did not elaborate.
   A statement from the Transvaal committee said it ``fears this
latest announcement will once again cause severe conflict in the
Moutse area.''
   ``It's going to leave the community devastated and bitter,''
said Joanne Yawitch of multiracial private group, which provides
aid on legal and other problems to blacks in the northeastern
province.
   ``The community had absolute faith in the court's judgment, yet
they see the government has no repect for that,'' she said.
   Most Moutse residents belong to the North Sotho tribe and
opposed the merger. They have great differences in language and
culture with Ndebeles, who make up most of the 400,000 people in
KwaNdebele, an impoverished district northeast of Pretoria.
   Moutse residents also fear the government in Pretoria will
designate KwaNdebele as one of the nominally independent black
homelands, thus depriving its residents of South African
citizenship.
   KwaNdebele is one of six semi-autonomous black homelands. Four
other homelands have been declared independent, but the status is
not recognized abroad.
   After the forced merger, residents of Moutse battled police and
vigilantes aligned with KwaNdebele officials, who had sought
incorporation in order to help their bid for independence.
   Botha said Tuesday it would serve no purpose to meet again with
Moutse community leaders, since he already knew they opposed
incorporation.
   About Oukasie, field workers of the Transvaal committee said the
``emergency camp'' designation meant it no longer was governed by
regular municipal laws and might be vulnerable to abolition by the
government.
   About 5,000 Oukasie residents have complied with government
efforts to relocate them 15 miles away, but 8,000 have refused to
move.
   Under the new regulations governing Oukasie, residents must get
permission to have overnight guests, renovate their homes or keep
pets.
   Activists say the government wants to demolish Oukasie because
whites in the town of Brits say the township is too close. The
official reason for the proposed removal is that Oukasie is a slum
and renovating it would cost too much.
   Government officials said Tuesday's declaration meant no new
residents would be allowed in Oukasie, but denied it was a prelude
to forced removal.
   The committee called the designation ``a further attempt to
totally demoralize and intimidate the community so that ultimately
they move 'voluntarily.'''
   Field worker Alan Morris said: ``What we see is maybe the final
weapon in the state's armory, short of sending the bulldozers in.''

<HEAD>Dukakis to Bush: Delighted to Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis said Wednesday he would be
delighted to debate Republican George Bush in the fall on such
issues as the Iran-Contra affair but he insisted he has not yet
wrapped up the Democratic nomination.
   The Massachusetts governor doggedly promised to campaign in
every primary state through California, even after a smashing win
in Pennsylvania on Tuesday over Democratic presidential Jesse
Jackson gave him a big lead in the nomination fight.
   Dukakis brushed aside concerns that Jackson's attempts to set
the policy agenda would split the Democrats, even as he fired again
at Bush, the certain GOP nominee.
   ``I see very broad agreement in the Democratic Party,'' he told
reporters in a statehouse news conference. ``I don't believe it is
going to be very difficult to get a good strong platform.''
   The Democratic hopeful spent most of the day on state business
before going to Springfield, Mass., to highlight his support for
plant-closing legislation nearing final passage in Washington. He
took the occasion to fire a round at Bush on whether Bush supports
President Reagan's promised veto of the bill.
   ``I think the vice president would be well advised to stop
criticizing others for a while and address some fundamental issues
facing this country,'' Dukakis told the news conference. ``Where is
he on the plant-closing bill? Doesn't he think it is the right and
fair thing to let workers and their families know at least 60 days
in advance that they are going to be thrown out of work?''
   Bush said earlier Wednesday that he was ready for attacks on the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Let him fire away,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis obliged: ``He sat there and did nothing while we engaged
in one of the worst and one of the most misguided adventures in the
history of American foreign policy. I can't imagine what they were
thinking of when they proceeded to do business with a terrorist
nation.''
   Later, he added: ``That's going to be an issue in the campaign,
no question about it.''
   He also took a swipe at those who said a Bush-Dukakis campaign
would be a fight between dull politicians.
   ``I've never been in a dull, boring contest in my life and I
don't expect this one to be one either,'' he said. .
   Dukakis was always careful to preface his comments about the
fall campaign with the supposition that he would be the nominee.
After winning the Tuesday primary, he promised to campaign in every
state primary between now and June 7.
   That strategy is not only an effort to avoid an embarrassing
loss for the front-runner, but also to build for the fall campaign.
   ``We are working hard in California,'' said Dukakis campaign
manager Susan Estrich. ``California is also very important in the
general election. As much as we can do there now is also an
investment for the fall.''
   Dukakis heads back out on the campaign trail Thursday to Ohio,
which holds a primary next Tuesday along with Indiana and the
District of Columbia.
   The six weeks between May 3 and June 7 will be busy ones for
Dukakis, his aides say, but less with campaigning and more with
efforts directed at pulling the Democrats together and getting
ready for the fall.
   He will return to states which have already taken part in the
primary process _ such as Texas _ make major speeches on education,
jobs and the environment. He will travel to Washington to meet with
party leaders and perhaps make a commencement address on a black
university campus to symbolize his reaching out to the black
community that has been solidly behind Jackon.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Could Become Another Lebanon, Pakistan Leader Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan, that
nation could face civil war resembling the turmoil in Lebanon and
provide a tempting target for Iran or other outside forces, a
Pakistani opposition leader said Wednesday.
   It is urgent for the United States, Pakistan, the United Nations
and others with potential influence to encourage formation of a
stable, broad-based future Afghan government, Benazir Bhutto told a
news conference.
   ``Otherwise, there is the threat of continuing civil war and the
threat of fragmentation of Afghanistan, sucking in others,'' she
said.
   Pakistanis, coping with an influx of more than 3 million Afghan
refugees who fled Soviet occupation, fear that ``instead of those
refugees who are in Pakistan returning, maybe even more refugees
will come because of continuing civil war in Afghanistan,'' said
Ms. Bhutto, chairwoman of the Pakistan Peoples Party.
   ``The other fear (is that) ... Afghanistan is in danger of
becoming another Lebanon with different factions holding sway in
different parts,'' she continued.
   ``If there is a vacuum ... it will be difficult for Pakistan to
just ignore the situation. On the other side, there are
Persian-speaking Afghans. Iran so far has not taken any deep
interest in Afghan internal affairs. Nonetheless, it may find in a
vacuum it is also tempted to exert its influence,'' Ms. Bhutto said.
   It is certain that ``a vacuum being created in Afghanistan is
dangerous,'' she said, thus the United States, Pakistan or ``any of
the countries in the world'' with influence should work together
through U.N. Undersecretary-General Diego Cordovez or other
auspices ``to try and form a coalition or leadership which is
acceptable'' to the Afghans.
   Cordovez is the Ecuadorean U.N. official negotiated the accord
under which an estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers are to begin
leaving Afghanistan next month. He has announced plans to turn his
efforts to the problem of transition from the Marxist regime
installed when the Soviets arrived at the end of 1979.
   Ms. Bhutto said Pakistanis ``expect the present (Afghan)
administration not to last after Soviet withdrawal.'' After its
collapse, she predicted ``various Afghan groups, although divided
among themselves, will all march unitedly toward Kabul. ... If some
solution is not worked out beforehand, then we can have these
different factions fighting each other.''
   Describing the United States as both Pakistan's principal aid
donor and a source of influence toward democratization, Ms. Bhutto
said, ``It is of concern that U.S. interest for Pakistan and,
indeed, the democratization process, should not wane. Many of us
fear that the democratization process could well be aborted'' after
an Afghanistan settlement, she added.
   Ms. Bhutto said Pakistan's ``transition to full democracy''
could be difficult if President Mohammed Zia Ul-haq runs for
re-election because it is questionable whether he would permit
opposition parties such as hers to contest for seats or to control
parliament.
   The Peoples Party was founded by Ms. Bhutto's father, the late
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown in a
bloodless 1977 coup led by Zia, and was hanged two years later
after being convicted of ordering a political murder.

report on the mood among the Red Army troops by Russian-speaking AP
Moscow correspondent Carol J. Williams, making a return trip to
Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   For 20-year-old Yuri Mushnikov, the
end of the war in Afghanistan is only seven days away.
   On May 4, the native Siberian will get his wake-up call for the
flight back to the Soviet Union.
   The sunburned blond soldier who has served two years without
home leave says he's seen all the horrors of war and never wants to
see any more.
   ``This war is evil,'' he said as he guarded a dusty outpost at
Kabul's southeastern perimeter. ``No one needs this war.''
   For his comrades performing their ``internationalist duty'' by
defending the government of President Najib against anti-communst
guerrillas, the war is almost over as well. At least it feels that
way.
   ``I'm ready to do my part and be among the first to leave,''
joked Sgt. Alexander Sayenko, a career soldier from Krasnodar in
southern Russia.
   After explaining to two American reporters that he wasn't
authorized to speak for his regiment, he confirmed that morale
among the Soviet troops in Afghanistan has improved greatly since
the signing April 14 of an agreement calling for withdrawal of all
Red Army forces.
   ``I haven't seen my wife for 10 months, of course we are excited
about going home,'' said Sayenko. ``All we can say is, thank God.''
   None of the seven soldiers interviewed Wednesday said they
considered it a mistake for the Soviet Union to have come to the
aid of the government forces in Afghanistan, but all expressed
fatigue with their role in the war that has raged in this Moslem
country for 10 years.
   ``Everyone is very happy that we are going home soon,'' said
Capt. Andrei Dobrovolskz, 31, of the Moldavian city of Rybnitsa.
``But in any event, our goals were accomplished here by the signing
of the agreement in Geneva.''
   While the accord sets out plans for Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan, no one expects the fighting to end immediately. That
belief was underscored Wednesday when a bomb exploded in Kabul,
killing six people and injuring dozens more.
   Since the signing of the accord, which sets a May 15 date for
the start of a Soviet pullout expected to be completed by the end
of the year, morale among the Soviet troops has improved markedly,
the soldiers said.
   The relaxed atmosphere was apparent in their readiness to talk
openly without the approval of superiors and the general sense that
for them, the war is nearly over.
   Their candid disclosure that they had seen others die in battle
and felt the pain of uncertainty about the Soviet role was in sharp
contrast with the past attitudes.
   On previous visits to Kabul, foreign reporters approaching
Soviet soldiers were chased away before getting close enough to
speak. Warning shots were fired over the heads of four American
journalists who tried to photograph a unit near the airport in
January 1987.
   Despite the improved atmosphere, it is still unpleasant for
Soviets in Afghanistan. Afghans close their eyes when they pass
Soviet soldiers in a sign of rejection, and the soldiers have been
ordered to stay out of public markets, where troops have been
stabbed by Afghans opposed to their involvement in the war.
   ``We want the Russians to leave our country,'' a student in his
early 20s said in broken English, adding that many would like to
see a return of the king, who lives in Italy.
   For the Afghans, the toughest battles may lie ahead, after the
115,000 Soviets in Afghanistan leave Najib's estimated 40,000
troops to fend for themselves against a factional but sizable
guerrilla force.
   ``The Afghan soldiers cannot succeed without our help. Time will
show that,'' said Mushnikov. ``But everyone is sick of the war in
Afghanistan.''
   Mushnikov, from the Siberian city of Irkutsk, said he had ``seen
everything'' during battles to defend the southern city of Kandahar
against guerrilla attacks.
   What happens to the Afghanistan government is a matter for the
Afghans themselves to decide, the soldiers said.
   A private from the Ukrainian city of Donetsk who would identify
himself only as Sergei said it was none of the Soviets' business
who leads the country, and that the sooner they ended their
involvement, the better.

   A retired investment banker who was
originally charged with attempted murder was given the minimum
sentence for assault of 1{ to 4{ years in jail Wednesday for
shooting a teen-ager during a traffic dispute on a parkway.
   ``You appear to be a good and decent person except for one
terrible transgression,'' state Supreme Court Justice Nicholas
Colabella told Arthur K. Salomon just before sentencing.
   Salomon, 53, of Pound Ridge and Manhattan, is the grandson of
one of the founders of the Salomon Brothers investment firm.
   Under a plea bargaining agreement reached in March, Salomon
pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of assault and Colabella had
promised a jail term of two to six years in prison. The maximum is
five to 15 years.
   Colabella said he cut the planned sentence after receiving
numerous letters and a pre-sentencing report. He said the jail term
was ``justified under all the circumstances in this case.''
   Salomon had been charged with attempted murder for shooting
Gianluca Cotugno, 19, of Larchmont, once with a licensed
.38-caliber revolver. Cotugno a student at Iona College, spent two
weeks in the hospital recovering.
   Salomon said June 19, 1987, the day he shot Cotugno, was a ``day
I'd like to forget as much as the Cotugno family. ... The last 10
months have been hell. I don't expect the Cotugno family to ever
forgive me.''
   The two pulled over at a Scarsdale exit after an incident on the
Hutchinson River Parkway in Westchester County. Salomon maintained
when he pleaded guilty that Cotugno came toward him with his arms
waving so he pulled his gun and shot him.
   But prosecutor George Bolen said that as Cotugno approached
Salomon's car, he saw Salomon pointing the gun at him, took down
the license plate number and told Salomon he was going to notify
police.
   After Colabella told Salomon Wednesday of his right to appeal,
Salomon said, shaking his head, ``There will be no appeal.''
   Outside the courtroom, Salomon said he felt he had been treated
fairly and ``I'm glad this whole incident is all over. I'll be away
for a year and a half.''
   Asked how he felt about prison, he said, ``I'll survive.''
   Neither Cotugno nor his family were in court. The family lawyer,
Stephen Heard, said the youth's $20 million civil suit against
Salomon would proceed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan with a
conference next month.

<HEAD>Group Urges More Active Role In Identifying Alcohol, Drug Abusers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National School Boards Association on
Wednesday urged schools to take a more active role in identifying
alcohol and drug abusers and in developing programs to help those
students.
   In a 60-page report, the association suggested that schools
designate at least one person _ such as the school nurse or a
specially hired drug counselor _ to serve as an adviser and liaison
between students, teachers, parents and outside treatment programs.
   The report also recommended that schools develop policies on
substance abuse and teach students, beginning in kindergarten,
about the effects of drug and alcohol and how to avoid peer
pressure to use them.
   The association said the education programs should start out
with simple explanations in the early grades and gradually get more
detailed in later grades. Starting drug prevention programs at the
high school level is too late, the report said.
   ``While this problem of drug and alcohol abuse shouldn't be
imposed on school systems _ schools weren't created to deal with
social problems _ this problem does affect education, association
President Leonard Rovins said in announcing release of the
``Alcohol and Drugs in the Schools'' report.
   Rovins said that substance abuse can affect students' ability to
learn and can cause problems ranging from chronic truancy and
falling grades to family violence and suicide.
   He estimated that more than half of all school districts now
have policies dealing with drug and alcohol abuse, but warned that
although student use of cocaine and marijuana is down, use of crack
and alcohol is up.
   ``Clearly,'' he said, ``the battle is far from won.''
   Rovins said the report will be distributed to school boards
across the country.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Archives on Wednesday opened for
public viewing the first batch of documents collected by the U.S.
Army in the Vietnam War, records amassed by infantry divisions and
brigades from 1954 to 1975.
   The documents in the first release are 12 million pages _ one
sixth of the 72 million pages that will be released eventually. The
next batch will be opened to public scrutiny in April 1990.
   Coincidentally, the release falls nearly on the 13th anniversary
of the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975.
   America's involvement in Vietnam began during World War II, when
American Office of Strategic Services teams, the forerunner of the
CIA, joined with Vietnamese guerrillas in hiding from Japanese
invaders.
   In 1950, the first members of the U.S. military assistance and
advisory group arrived in Saigon _ beginning a buildup of American
forces that would eventually reach 550,000 troops at the height of
the war in 1968.
   Susan Cooper of the Archives staff said the documents vary
according to units. They include daily journals, general and
operational orders, organizational history files, after-action
reports of combat operations, quarterly operations reports and
files on ``lessons learned.''
   Policy decisions are not included in the current batch, she
said, but there are periodic intelligence reports and operational
summaries. The files are from the U.S. military assistance commands
in Vietnam as well as Thailand.

<HEAD>House Adopts Arms Control Restrictions Prior to U.S.-Soviet Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a pair of arms control
restrictions Wednesday, rejecting criticism that it might hurt next
month's U.S.-Soviet summit meeting.
   The two provisions were added to the Pentagon budget bill and
were similar to restrictions added in each of the past two years by
the Democratic-controlled chamber in votes which split largely
along party lines.
   The White House had lobbied against both restrictions, as it had
in the past, and also opposes several other Democratic-backed
provisions scheduled to be considered by the chamber during the
next three weeks.
   First the House voted 252-159 to ban any tests of Star Wars
anti-missile defense systems which would violate the ``narrow''
interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   Then the chamber gave 240-174 approval to a ban on spending for
any weapons that would violate the numerical restrictions on
various types of atomic weapons that are contained in the 1979 SALT
II treaty. President Reagan says the Soviets are violating the
unratified treaty and he won't be guided any longer by its
restrictions.
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., opposed the amendments and told
Democrats, ``Why you want to cripple Ronald Reagan three weeks
before the summit is beyond me.''
   Reagan will travel to Moscow on May 29 to meet with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It will be the fourth time the two
leaders have met in the past three years.
   Democrats responded to Hunter by noting that the limitations had
been added to past Pentagon budget bills and had not harmed arms
control efforts.
   ``This is the same kind of thing we've done before and there
hasn't been a problem,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., chief
sponsor of the SALT II provision.
   The amendments were added to a bill authorizing $299.5 billion
in Pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1. The
total is about the same as this year's defense budget and it
resulted from last December's ``budget summit'' between Reagan and
Congress which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit.
   The bill that passes the House will have to be reconciled with
the separate measure which will be passed by the Senate. That
chamber is moving more slowly on the Pentagon budget, which is now
being written by the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The ABM restriction arises from a three-year fight that has its
roots in Reagan's assertion that he has the legal authority to
unilaterally change how the United States inteprets the 1972 pact.
A ``broad'' interpretation would allow wide-scale tests of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, the formal name of Reagan's Star Wars
program.
   But congressional Democrats have disputed Reagan's claim, and
the White House has not pressed the issue. None of the SDI tests
scheduled for the next 18 months would violate the ``strict''
interpretation.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called the restrictions ``unilateral
disarmament of a benign, but nonetheless serious, sort.''
   But Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., ``we're not doing anything more
than what the administration says it is doing.''
   In another matter Wednesday, the House voted without dissent to
name the Navy's next Trident ballistic submarine after the late
Rep. Melvin Price, D-Ill., calling it a fitting tribute to the
champion of the nation's nuclear fleet.
   Price, a 22-term congressional veteran, died Friday of cancer at
age 83.
   Price was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for 10
years. He also was a member of the defunct Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy and was one of the chief congressional proponents of
developing nuclear-powered submarines and surface ships.

   An Israeli girl whose death raised a furor in
the occupied lands was fatally shot by a careless Jewish settler
during a clash provoked by hostile Arabs, an Israeli army report
concluded Wednesday.
   Tirza Porat, 15, the first Jewish settler to die in the wave of
unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories since Dec. 8, was a
victim of an errant bullet and not an Arab stone, the report.
   But the report placed the bulk of the blame on Arabs from the
West Bank town of Beita for triggering the April 6 fight with
Jewish hikers from the settlement of Elon Moreh.
   Miss Porat and two Arab villagers were killed in the clash.
Romam Aldubi, 26, an Israeli soldier on leave who was guarding the
hikers, was critically wounded by stones.
   The report said Aldubi, who killed a fleeing Arab by shooting
him in the back, acted over-anxiously and negligently during the
clash.
   ``Ms. Porat was shot by Aldubi's gun, apparently after he
reacted instinctively to the rock thrown at his head,'' the report
said. ``The possibility that an additional weapon ... was used
against the hikers .... was not proven.''
   The army report was meant to clear the air after conflicting
versions of the incident caused nationwide controversy and anguish.
   The army initially said the girl died from a stone thrown by
Palestinians, prompting a wave of retaliatory violence by Jewish
settlers against Arabs in the occupied territories.
   Subsequent reports indicated that the girl was killed by an
Israeli weapon. Some hikers contended that an Arab had shot the
girl.
   The final army report placed most of the blame on the villagers.
   ``The motivation and aggressiveness of the local residents who
deliberately attacked Jewish hikers was the major cause of the
incident and led to the tragic conclusion,'' the report said.
   But it also criticized the settlers for hiking in the area
without coordinating their movements with the army.
   Villages began throwing stones from afar when the hikers stopped
for breakfast in a dry riverbed near Beita, the report said.
   It said Aldubi fired several warning shots, and the group
continued to walk along the riverbed until it encountered a large
group of villagers, who also threw stones.
   Aldubi fired again, killing villager Mussa Salah Daud, who was
shot in the back as he fled the scene, the report said. Aldubi
wounded a second villager, Taisir Sallah Adili, in the stomach.
   The report criticized Aldubi, saying ``Negligence in operating
the weapon, ignoring common sense precautions, and over-hastiness
in pulling the trigger were contributing factors to the escalation
of events in this tragic incident.''
   After the shooting, hundreds of villagers surrounded the
Israelis and forced them to walked into the center of Beita.
   In Beita, the sister of the man killed in the riverbed threw a
rock at Aldubi, provoking a mass riot, the report said. Villagers
attacked the group with rocks, clubs and ``anything that came to
hand,'' the report said.
   The report said that Aldubi was hit by the rock and
``instinctively ... fired several bullets while turning around.''
   He fired again when one of the villagers tried to grab his gun.
   It was during these shootings that Miss Porat and the second
Palestinian were killed and another villager was wounded, the
report said.
   ``We fully trust the final report,'' Uri Ariel, head of the
Council of Jewish Settlements in the West Bank, told Israel radio.
   But Ariel called for additional punishment of Beita villagers.
   The army has destroyed 14 houses, expelled six Beita residents
to Lebanon, and detained dozens for questioning.
   Bezalel Reshef, a leader of the left-wing Peace Now movement,
criticized the crackdown and said it had ``led to a serious
deterioration of Arab-Jewish relations. The settlers used this
event ... to incite the public and their leaders.''

   About 5,000 public school teachers taking
part in a nationwide strike marched in the capital Wednesday to
demand higher pay.
   The 272,000 school teachers on strike nationwide have walked out
nine days in the last two months to put pressure on government
leaders. The walkouts have forced cancellation of classes for the
more than 5 million students in public schools.
   Another group of public educators, Spain's 38,000 university
professors, also went out on strike for higher pay Wednesday. Their
walkout caused suspension of classes for 1 million students.
   The marchers stopped at the Education Ministry, where they gave
an assistant secretary a statement outlining their demands of pay
parity with other similarly qualified civil servants, a spokeswoman
for the teachers said.
   The public school unions have rejected a government offer to
raise pay by nearly $300 million. They want an overall increase of
nearly $900 million.

   A school bus was temporarily sidelined for
spelling problems.
   One side of the bus displayed lettering that read: ``Propety of
Madison County Schools.''
   ``It's kind of embarrassing to have a bus run down the road with
a word misspelled on it,'' county school Superintendent Melvin Ray
said Tuesday.
   Ray said the misspelled ``Propety'' would soon be replaced with
the proper spelling.
   The school board recently hired someone to paint the lettering
on the bus. Ray said he didn't want to identify the painter to

   When it comes to designing and flying paper
airplanes, engineering majors at Georgia Tech were no match for
7-year-old Ian Campbell.
   Ian, a second-grader, took first prize in design Tuesday in the
30th Great American Paper Airplane Contest.
   In the ``best new design'' category, he defeated three
engineering majors. In the ``longest time aloft'' category, his
plane was only half a second behind the winner.
   Ian's winning plane in the new-design category, chosen by an
Eastern Airlines official, looked like a long plane attached to a
shorter one.
   ``It mostly flies straight,'' he said.
   Ian's main competition in the category was an entry by Richard
Swartz of New York, an aerospace engineering senior. Swartz had
planned to have his tiny balsa wood plane powered by a housefly,
but the insect died.
   Asked when his power source had expired, Swartz said, ``When he
saw the airplane, I think.''
   Ian had a near-casualty in warmups for the ``longest time
aloft'' category when his plane landed on a chandelier.

   The kitchen of Tammy and Craig Wilson's
mobile home is overflowing with Dalmatian puppies.
   Daisy, a 3-year-old Dalmatian, gave birth last month to 17
puppies, nine females and eight males.
   ``When I got home from work about 5 o'clock Daisy had six
pups,'' Tammy Wilson said. ``I thought that was real nice. By 10
o'clock that night, she had 10 pups. I heard a ruckus and got up to
check them about 3 a.m. and I could swear I counted 15. By 7
o'clock in the morning there were 17 pups with her.''
   Daisy has been feeding her pups in two shifts; the Wilsons buy
baby forumla by the gallon to supplement their diet.
   Dr. Karen Slack, a veterinarian, said a 17-pup litter is unusual.
   ``With large dogs, it's not uncommon for them to have litters of
maybe 10 or 11, but not 17.''

<HEAD>Water Supply Declared Safe After Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A toxic chemical leak that threatened part of the
capital's water supply has washed safely beyond a treatment plant,
authorities said Wednesday.
   ``It was an awfully scary feeling,'' said Eijiro Motegi, deputy
director of the water department. ``Deadly chemcials were
approaching, while more than 2 million residents were about to go
waterless.''
   The leak occurred Monday when workers at Diesel Kiki Co.'s
Sayama factory, about 30 miles north of Tokyo, were operating a
pump that processes toxic metal-coating chemicals. The chemicals,
including 77 pounds of sodium cyanide _ enough to kill 350,000
people _ leaked into the Iruma River, police said.
   Fatal levels of sodium cyanide were detected Tuesday near the
spill site. Environmental officials said 1,000 fish were killed,
but no residents fell ill.
   Authorities temporarily stopped taking water from one of their
plants when sodium cyanide was detected nearby. The Tokyo
metropolitan government, which depends less heavily on the river
for its water, switched to another source.
   Authorities suspect the leak occurred when a worker forgot to
shut a valve on the pump completely, said Masami Takagi of Sayama
police.

   On the West Bank and Gaza strip, rocks and
bullets are the projectiles of choice in the battle between
Israelis and Palestinians. In America, the battle is waged with
newspaper advertisements.
   ``Sometimes the only way to get what you want said into the
newspaper is to pay for it,'' said Ruth Popkin, president of
Hadassah, the Jewish women's group that placed an ad calling for a
dialogue between women in the Mideast.
   There are ads that call for an end to ``all aid to apartheid
Israel.'' There are ads that say, ``We stand with (Israelis) in
your hour of trial, are confident in your essential decency and
commitment to democratic values.''
   Readers of The New York Times and The Washington Post have grown
accustomed to such ads through the years; The Christian Science
Monitor, The Wall Street Journal, The Boston Globe, the Nation,
Harper's and the New York Review of Books also are favored media
for issues ads.
   Now, smaller newspapers like the Santa Barbara (Calif.)
News-Press have found that they, too, are serving as soapboxes for
Mideast matters.
   Robert Rawls, responsible for advocacy advertising at The
Washington Post, says the paper considers it an important source of
revenue. ``We particularly carry a lot of advertising on anything
concerning Israel or the Middle East because those different groups
have money to spend,'' he said.
   Free speech is not cheap. A full-page ad in The New York Times
costs about $40,000; a similar ad in The Washington Post costs
$30,000.
   Though Arab-Americans have purchased some ads, most have been
initiated by Jews, and the ads' divergent viewpoints reflect
conflicts within the Jewish community on Israel's policies in the
occupied territories.
   In March, Daniel Benson and four other New York City
professionals organized the Ad Hoc Committee for Middle East Policy
Options.
   Benson said the five put up $36,000 for the first of a series of
ads in the Times because they wanted visiting Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to know that some American Jews support his
position.
   They joined ``The War of the Ads,'' as he called it, to decrease
the pressure on Israel to ``trade territory for so-called peace.''
   ``We see the riots as just another phase in the campaign against
Israel, in the war against Israel,'' said Benson.
   In contrast, Mark Bruzonsky, an attorney who used to work for
the American Jewish Congress, arranged an ad that advocates
reducing U.S. aid to Israel as well as military and intelligence
cooperation.
   ``We as American Jews don't want to be associated with what
Israel is doing,'' said Bruzonsky. ``It's both embarrassing and
shameful that the United States continues to support these
policies, which are abhorrent.''
   ``It is no secret that the Jewish lobby is extremely powerful,
members of Congress are afraid of speaking out,'' Bruzonsky said.
``That made it more important that American Jews like ourselves
have the courage to speak out.''
   Michael Lerner, editor of Tikkun magazine and an organizer of an
ad campaign calling for an end to the military occupation, said he
has received death threats in the mail because of the ads.
   But Jack Mondlak says his apartment has been inundated with mail
supporting his full-page ads in the Times calling upon Israel to
maintain control over the territories.
   ``It is not true what some people say that the American Jewish
community is divided over Israel; 99 percent are steadfast behind
Israel,'' he said. He has spent $300,000 of his publishing fortune
on ads in dozens of papers.
   Some advertisers seek to balance what they call biased news
coverage. The Foundation for Middle East Peace ran an ad detailing
a Palestinian proposals for steps toward peace that it thought
reporters had overlooked.

<HEAD>Smoking Curbs on Jetliners Working Without Incident, Airlines Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Travelers seem to have accepted the new curbs
on cigarette smoking aboard commercial jetliners, with no major
incidents reported during the first few days of the restrictions,
airline officials report.
   While many smokers have complained about the smoking ban on
domestic lights of two hours or less, they have made no attempt to
challenge it, said spokesmen for more than a half-dozen major
airlines and the flight attendants union.
   ``There has been no problem that I'm aware of. I think most
people were aware of the rule and took it in stride,'' USAir
spokesman David Shipley said Wednesday. Smoking was prohibited on
about 90 percent of USAir's flights when the ban went into effect
at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   Cindy Yeast, a spokeswoman for the Association of Flight
Attendants, which has 21,000 members at most of the major air
carriers, said the smoking curb seems to be ``working well'' and
she knew of no incidents.
   At Northwest Airlines, where the ban went beyond government
requirements and includes all domestic flights except those to
Hawaii, officials said they anticipated some challenges to the
rule, but have had none.
   ``We didn't have a single incident where we've even had to chide
anybody. ... We anticipated more of a problem than there was,''
said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons.
   Spokesmen for other airlines made similar reports.
   The regulation carries a penalty of up to $1,000 for anyone
violating the ban and up to $2,000 if a passenger tampers with a
smoke alarm in an aircraft lavatory in an effort to take some
undetected puffs.
   Leslie Roland, a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association,
the airlines' trade group, attributed the smooth introduction of
the restrictions to advance warning given passengers. She also said
introduction of the rule was made easier because it came on a
weekend when air travel generally is less hectic.
   ``Frankly, I was surprised,'' she said.
   ``It's really been a non-event,'' said Bill Berry, a spokesman
for Delta Air Lines, where the smoking prohibition applies to about
70 percent of flights. ``For American it's gone extremely
smoothly,'' said Jim Brown, a spokesman for the airline.
   Some airlines provided smokers with hard candy or gum to ease
their cravings.
   At times there has been some confusion over what flights might
be covered by the ban.
   United Airlines, for example, allows smoking on westbound
flights between Chicago and Philadelphia, but prohibits smoking on
eastbound flights between the same cities because they take less
than two hours.
   But overall, said United spokesman Dan Sheehy, ``it's really
gone very smoothly. ... It wasn't sprung on people. There was
plenty of warning.''
   The tobacco industry, which is asking smokers to wage a campaign
to restore smoking on all flights, also said the first days of the
ban seemed to have passed without any confrontations.

   Authorities arrested a woman
Wednesday and accused her of desecrating a Jewish temple and a club
by placing pigs' heads with swastikas and outside the buildings.
   Yvonne Malone, 38, was charged with two counts of causing
criminal injury. Police said she telephoned local newspapers a week
ago and said six white men in Nazi-style uniforms had left the
pigs' heads, which bore a swastika on each forehead and a Star of
David on each ear.
   Police said they believe the woman committed the act alone.
   When the incident was reported last week, President P.W. Botha
and other political leaders denounced South Africa's small neo-Nazi
movement.
   Ms. Malone appeared in Durban regional court and entered no
plea. The court released her without bail until June 1.

   Sinhalese militants planted a time
bomb that exploded Wednesday near a government-run newsstand and
injured three people, police said.
   Two gasoline bombs also went off Wednesday in a nearby town, but
there were no casualties and little damage.
   The time bomb went off in a garbage can in the town of
Peradeniya in central Sri Lanka about 60 miles northeast of
Colombo, said Tilak Beddawela, a police officer in nearby Kandy.
   He blamed the outlawed People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese
guerrilla group that opposes an Indian-brokered peace accord signed
in July to try to end the nearly five-year war for independence by
the island's minority Tamils.
   The Sinhalese front says the pact makes too many concessions to
Tamils and has vowed to kill anyone who supports it. Police say the
front has killed more than 200 people since the agreement was
signed.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu and make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million population, claim they are discriminated against
by majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the government and
military of the island off India's southern coast.

<HEAD>Former CBS News Chief Urges Fee To Help Support Public
Broadcasting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former CBS News President Fred Friendly on
Wednesday had few good words to say about commercial television
stations and supported a proposal to impose a fee on these ``money
machines'' to help foot the bill for public broadcasting.
   Friendly, testifying for more than an hour before a Senate
Commerce subcommittee, said Congress has a duty to establish a
stable source of money for the public TV and radio system it
created 20 years ago.
   He said commercial television ``has become, tragically, a money
machine.''
   ``Commercial TV makes so much doing its worst that it can't
afford to do its best,'' said the journalist who headed CBS News
from 1964-66.
   Friendly said the deregulatory climate of the Reagan
administration that has resulted in fewer restrictions on the
operations of broadcast stations is hurting the viewing public.
   ``You can't go on letting the public airwaves be raped by people
who don't give a damn about content but only care what they can
sell the station for in two or three years,'' he said.
   Friendly, a professor emeritus at Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism, reminded members of the communications
subcommittee that Congress created public broadcasting but
chastised them for failing to fulfill the promise of providing
sufficient funds to operate the system adequately.
   ``You've created an illegitimate child,'' he said. ``You have
disinherited him and made him into a begging pauper.''
   Friendly endorsed a proposal by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., to
impose a fee of 2 percent to 4 percent of the fair market value of
a broadcast station upon its sale. The higher fee would be imposed
on stations sold within three years of acquiring the license.
   Such a fee would raise an estimated $275 million a year, which
would go into a trust fund to support public broadcasting.
   Commercial broadcasters oppose the proposal. Edward O. Fritts,
president of the National Association of Broadcasters, said
commercial stations' free use of the spectrum is a fair exchange
for their responsibilities to serve the public interest and provide
free TV service to the public.
   Hollings added a similar measure to a spending bill last year,
except that the amount of the fee was tied to a station's
compliance with the fairness doctrine, a former Federal
Communications Commission policy that required broadcasters to air
opposing views on controversial topics.
   The FCC, with the Reagan administration's support, abolished the
policy last August, and since then Hollings and other Democrats on
Capitol Hill have been trying to revive the doctrine.
   In a face-off with President Reagan in the waning hours of the
budget debate last December, Democrats withdrew their fairness
measure and the license transfer fees.
   This time, however, Hollings is drafting a measure that does not
include the fairness doctrine, and Sen. Robert Packwood, R-Ore., a
fairness doctrine opponent, said the move ``greatly increases
chances of passing the bill and of Reagan signing it.''
   Packwood, however, said he remains concerned about creating a
trust fund that would put public broadcasting's funding on
``automatic pilot'' without the system having to justify use of the
money.
   He warned commercial broadcasters, though, that ``some form of
tax is going to be levied on spectrum users'' and he advised them
to help devise a system rather than continue to fight it.
   The administration opposes Hollings' measure and is proposing to
use competitive bidding to assign licenses to certain portions of
the radio spectrum. The administration's proposal would not apply
to commercial stations.

   Mrs. Byrne lost her recent bid for the Democratic nomination for

   She said Tuesday she has accepted a job with Daniel J. Edelman
Inc., a public relations firm in Chicago.
   ``I will be working in public affairs, primarily on

familiar with the subject from her work as Chicago's commissioner
of consumer services in the 1970s.
   Mrs. Byrne also said she has begun writing her autobiography.
   After losing the Democratic primary in March, she vowed not to
seek elective office again.
   But she said she will use her background as the city's former
top officeholder to teach a course in government and political
science this summer at Loyola in Chicago.

   An unemployed handyman who abused drugs and
alcohol was convicted Wednesday of killing seven women while having
sex and leaving their bodies to rot in and near his apartment.
   Common Pleas Judge Robert A. Latrone convicted Harrison
``Marty'' Graham, who waived a jury trial, of seven counts each of
first-degree murder and abuse of a corpse. Latrone scheduled a
sentencing hearing for Thursday morning at which Assistant District
Attorney Roger King said he would seek the death penalty.
   ``For us, tomorrow is life or death,'' said defense attorney
Joel Moldovsky. ``We intend to fight for his life.''
   Graham, wearing a dark blue jacket and dark blue pants, sat
unmoved during the verdict, staring at the judge.
   Graham's mother, Lillian, seated in the first row of the
courtroom, also sat quietly, and refused to comment later.
   ``He deserves everything he gets,'' said Camilia DeShazor
Parker, the mother of one of Graham's victims, Robin DeShazor. ``I
still hate him.''
   Leroy Artison, the father of another victim, Sandra Garvin,
said, ``The way I feel is that there's nothing that can be done for
my daughter. She is gone.''
   But he also said: ``I have no hate. I have hurt. He has to go
before the international Supreme Court justice,'' referring to God.
   Graham, 28, did not testify during the trial, which started
March 7.
   The bodies were found last Aug. 9 and 10 after Graham was
evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench. Police pried
open a nailed door to find six rotting bodies in Graham's bedroom,
leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment house and a torso
in the basement of a neighboring house.
   Graham surrendered to police Aug. 16 at his mother's urging.
   The house is in a drug-infested neighborhood where Graham was
known as a handyman.
   Moldovsky had claimed his client was mentally retarded and did
not know right from wrong. He also said Graham might have killed
the women accidentally or because of drug or alcohol use.
   During closing arguments last Thursday, Moldovsky suggested the
women may have overdosed on drugs or that relatives of Graham's
landlord may have tampered with the murder scene.
   But King said Moldovsky's scenarios were ``sheer fantasy.'' He
contended Graham knew he was killing the seven women and knew it
was wrong. He called Graham a ``serial killer,'' whose acts were
``willful, intentional and premeditated.''
   In a confession admitted into evidence during the trial, Graham
told police the bodies began piling up in his bedroom and he began
having problems with maggots. He also said birds eating body parts
on his roof made sleeping during the day difficult.
   Moldovsky had argued the confession was made in violation of
Graham's constitutional rights and that Graham was beaten by police
during 17 hours of interrogation.

   A commission formed by the major political
parties said Wednesday that four cities have been tentatively
chosen for presidential debates this fall but that not all
candidates have yet agreed to take part.
   The cities and dates proposed by the 10-member Commission on
Presidential Debates are Annapolis, Md., on Sept. 14,
Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sept. 25, Omaha, Neb., on Oct. 11 and
Pittsburgh on Oct. 27.
   ``While commitments have not yet been received from allfrom all the
presidential candidates to debate under the auspices of our
commission, we believe the commission ... is best situated to
attract the candidates,'' commission co-chairmen Paul G. Kirk and
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., Democratic and GOP chiefs respectively,
said in a joint statement.
   ``The commission has always recognized that the final decisions
regarding debates lie with the candidates,'' they said.
   The parties' commission faces competition for control of this
fall's presidential debates from the League of Women Voters, which
has said it will sponsor three debates of its own.
   The league, sponsor of debates for the past three presidential
elections, earlier accused the parties of trying to ``steal the
debates'' from the non-profit organization and argued that
party-sponsored debates would not be free of bias.
   The campaign of Vice President George Bush, who clinched the
Republican nomination Tuesday, has recently taken care to make
clear it never promised the vice president would take part in any
specific debates.
   ``We've made no commitment to any particular sponsor, forum,
date or location,'' Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said
Wednesday. ``Obviously he will debate in the fall, but we feel it's
premature ... to be confirming all those specifics.''
   Bush himself, when asked Wednesday on ABC-TV whether he would
debate the Democratic nominee, said, ``Absolutely, no question
about it. We're going to negotiate on format, number of debates,
time, place, all that, but absolutely, I can't wait.''
   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis matched Bush's eagerness
for a face-off this fall if and when the vice president agrees to
debate him.
   ``I've already agreed. I don't think he has... I'd be
delighted,'' the Massachusetts governor told reporters Wednesday.
``I like debating.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Bows To Parliamentary Revolt On Welfare Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher's government, bowing to
parliamentary revolts within her Conservative Party, announced
Wednesday a string of concessions to help the poor.
   Opposition Labor Party legislators howled with derision as
Social Services Secretary John Moore described changes restoring
housing subsidies to more than 300,000 people, mainly elderly or
disabled.
   The concessions were aimed partly at stopping Conservative
dissidents from voting in favor of a Labor Party motion to censure
the government over proposed welfare changes.
   The motion, which accused the government of causing
``hardship,'' was later defeated by a vote of 324 to 228.
Independent Television News said no Conservatives voted in favor of
the motion Wednesday night.
   The concessions, which Moore said will cost the government $187
million a year, were widely regarded as the third significant
about-face by Mrs. Thatcher in recent months.
   ``The (welfare) system they (the government) have introduced has
proved harsh in its social consequences and embarrassing in its
political consequences,'' declared opposition Social Services
spokesman Robin Cook.
   Moore retorted that the government was responding to ``very
sensible pressure.''
   He added, ``Nothing could better show the government's
commitment to those who look to us for help.''
   The concessions included raising from $11,200 to $14,960 the
amount of savings allowed before claimants lose all state housing
subsidies.
   Last week, Conservative rebels slashed to 25 the government's
101-seat majority in the 650-member House of Commons in a vote on
proposed changes in property taxation, which critics say will be
unfair to the poorest.
   The backdown on housing subsidies followed a recent 15 percent
pay hike for nurses and extra funding for the financially strapped
National Health Service.
   Critics have charged that Mrs. Thatcher is bent on dismantling
the state health care system.
   Legislation altering the welfare system was passed in 1986, but
the changes took effect just three weeks ago.
   Since then, Laborites and newspapers have highlighted individual
cases of hardship. For example, Cook on Wednesday cited the case of
an elderly widow whose weekly income, after having to pay increased
housing costs, fell from $146 to $88.
   Mrs. Thatcer has said the welfare reforms, which have not cut
the $86 billion welfare bill, are aimed at ending the ``dependency
culture'' and funneling help to the poorest.
   But a major aim was to reduce housing subsidies.
   Critics acknowledge that the changes in welfare payments _
affecting about 8 million people, or one in seven Britons _ have
ended anomalies that often made it more profitable to be on welfare
than to take a low-paying job.
   Senior government sources noted most of the program remained
intact, but acknowledged Mrs. Thatcher made the concessions because
of worry among rank-and-file legislators.
   ``When you are doing all these things that intimately touch the
lives of all 55 million inhabitants (of Britain) then quite clearly
you can understand that there is some uneasiness,'' said a senior
government source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The proposed property tax changes, under which taxes will be
levied against each adult in a home instead of the residence, face
possible defeat this summer in the unelected House of Lords. But
the Lords can, at most, only delay measures for up to six months.
   Legislation providing for the new tax system completed a stormy
passage through the Commons last week.
   The government slashed the top tax rate this month from 60
percent to 40 percent.
   Polls show Mrs. Thatcher's lead over Labor narrowing, but she
remains about five points ahead of Labor in most recent opinion
polls.

<HEAD>Authorities Try to Unravel Dead Man's Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MURRYSVILLE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities investigating rapes and
murders in at least five states are trying to unravel the life of a
53-year-old suburban Pittsburgh businessman who committed suicide
during a confrontation with police.
   Pennsylvania authorities are scheduled to meet this week with
other police agencies to share evidence in their investigation of
Gary Alan Robbins, a Murrysville real estate and insurance salesman
who was charged in 1971 with armed robbery in an Ohio assault.
   Robbins shot himself to death April 14 during a confrontation
with a Pennsylvania state trooper in Somerset County, according to
authorities.
   Less than an hour earlier, Robbins allegedly had tried to enter
the Brothers Valley Township home of Mary Marker, 42, wife of state
trooper David Marker, and allegedly shot her in the face with a
handgun, according to authorities. The woman was able to call state
police.
   Since the shooting, police have been trying to determine if
Robbins had a role in various unsolved crimes during the past
several years in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Michigan and Iowa
with which he has thus far been only loosely connected, according
to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
   Authorities are re-checking the details of the torture and rape
of a Butler woman in 1985; the killing of a woman in Reed City,
Mich.; the rape of one woman and the killing of another near
Baltimore; and the killing of a woman in Chester, W.Va., in July,
according to the newspaper.
   Pennsylvania police also have received inquiries from Mayfield
Village, Ohio, and Burlington, Iowa, where murders of women fit the
same pattern of an encounter with a short, well-dressed man with
glasses who was involved with real estate sales, the newspaper
reported. In each case, he blindfolded his victims, muzzled them
with duct tape and tied them up with cord.
   ``If he is the one they're looking for now, I'm glad he's dead _
not only for what he did to me and my daughter, but what he did to
others,'' Dorothy Barkley of Tallmadge, Ohio, an early victim of
Robbins recently told the newspaper.
   Mrs. Barkley said Robbins came to her suburban Akron home in
February 1970, identifying himself as a Chicago doctor who was
reclocating in the area and wanted to look at her home, which was
for sale.
   She said Robbins produced a handgun and forced her and her
13-year-old daughter into their basement, where he blindfolded and
bound them with tape and cord.
   ``He was sweating and angry, shouting at me constantly as he
tied my hands and legs together behind my back,'' she recalled. She
didn't resist Robbins ``because he told me he would kill us both,''
she said.
   Police said Robbins did not molest or harm the woman or her
daughter. He took $5 from a purse and took several lace
handkerchiefs before fleeing.
   Police said Robbins was charged in 1971 with armed robbery in
the 1970 incident with the Barkleys and confessed to somewhat
similar cases in Youngstown, Salem and Alliance, Ohio. He pleaded
guilty to assaulting the Barkleys in exchange for five years'
probation with stipulations that he undergo ``continuous
psychiatric counseling.''
   Robbins, who then lived in Beaver, Pa., told police he had
deep-rooted sexual problems.
   Tallmadge police Lt. Donald Drum said Ohio authorities agreed to
drop some of the charges against Robbins because they viewed him as
being mentally ill not criminal. Alliance police Lt. Forrest Barber
agreed.
   ``I think everyone allowed him to walk on these crimes because
his psychiatrist at the time testified that he was undergoing some
type of surrogate sex therapy and was going to be all right _ but I
guess (therapy) might not have worked,'' Barber said.
   During the rest of the 1970s, court records in Beaver and
Allegheny counties reveal no criminal or financial problems for
Robbins, according to the Post-Gazette. Police surmise that the
intensive treatment he was receiving was working, it reported.
   In 1985, Robbins agreed to forfeit his real estate license after
admitting the theft of $10,000 in down payments from prospective
home buyers and in 1986 he was jailed over child support payments.

<TEXT>
   The deadline for the U.S. amnesty program for illegal aliens is
less than a week away, and officials say applications have doubled
in the last-minute rush.
   ``Basically, we're all procrastinators,'' said Ana Pardo at a
special Immigration and Naturalization Service office in Charlotte,
N.C., where some applicants slept overnight on the sidewalk outside.
   ``Now, they're all panicking,'' said Ms. Pardo.
   In the INS Western district, composed of California, Arizona,
Nevada, Hawaii and Guam, all INS offices will be open Sunday and a
new hotline telephone number has been established for callers,
according to Harold Ezell, INS regional commissioner.
   ``We've got so many applications we can't get them all fed into
the computer,'' Ezell said Wednesday. ``Monday we did 11,174
applications in the region, Tuesday we did 12,570. At our highest
day at the peak before the summer (last year) we did 7,000 and
thought that was phenomenal.
   ``The procrastinators are coming forward,'' Ezell said.
   Under the main amnesty program, illegal immigrants face a May 4
deadline to apply for legal residency status. Last month, INS
officials decided to give people who had met the application
deadline 60 days to collect documents to prove they have lived in
the United States since Jan. 1, 1982.
   Under a second program, agricultural workers have until Nov. 30
to apply for amnesty. To be eligible, they must prove they have
worked as field hands for at least 90 days from May 1985 to May
1986.
   The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a measure to extend
the cutoff date from midnight May 4 to Nov. 30, but the bill faces
strong opposition in the Senate and a possible presidential veto.
INS officials oppose an extension of the yearlong program.
   In El Paso, Texas, immigration officials said Wednesday that
anyone with the necessary documents and $185 fee who is standing in
line in front of the INS center by midnight May 4 will be
considered to have met the deadline.
   One post office in El Paso and one in Albuquerque, N.M., will
stay open until midnight that day to handle the last-minute
applications, Postal Service spokesman Vaughn Musgrave said.
   In El Paso, the rush of applicants started about six weeks ago,
said INS District Director Al Giugni.
   From the beginning of the program last May until March 16,
Giugni said, the El Paso office handled 23,000 amnesty
applications. From March 17 until Tuesday, the office processed
12,370 applications, he said.
   ``We're going crazy,'' said attorney Bernard Perlmutter of Legal
Services of Greater Miami. ``There's all this last-minute
hysteria.''
   In the last 10 days, INS officials said that the number of
applicants in Florida had swelled from about 300 a week to about
700 a week.
   Charles Wheeler, director of the National Center for Immigrants'
Rights, said Wednesday that the rush for applications has doubled
in Los Angeles in the last month. The center provides assistance
for immigrants.
   INS officials originally estimated that between 2 million and 4
million illegal immigrants would seek amnesty. As of last week,
however, only 1.6 million had applied.

<HEAD>`Fever' Grips Soviet Union As Consumers Look for Sugar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoarding by moonshiners and by consumers who fear
a price increase is forcing sugar-loving Soviets to line up for
hours to buy a product more plentiful here than anywhere else in
the world.
   Sugar, which was in constant supply for years when many other
foods were hard to get, has disappeared from store shelves from the
western Ukraine to Siberia, the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said
Wednesday.
   The shortage could seriously embarrass Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for two reasons: he promised to improve food supplies to
Soviet consumers and he is responsible for tightening liquor
supplies, which encouraged moonshining.
   A middle-aged Moscow woman said that Tuesday afternoon, for the
first time she could recall, she could not find sugar at several of
her local food stores.
   ``It's as if a `sugar fever' has gripped the country in recent
months,'' Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   The Soviet Union produces more sugar than any other country in
the world, and increased its production by 10 percent in the first
quarter of 1988 over a similar period in 1987, the newspaper said.
   But demand for sugar increased by 22 percent in Estonia, 27
percent in the Ukraine and 63 percent in Moldavia, it said.
   Residents of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, say stores have
limited their hours for selling sugar to keep people from
surrounding areas from coming into Kiev and buying up the supply.
   A Western reporter who visited Krasnodar in southern Russian in
early April saw at least 20 people lined up to buy sugar at a store
that limited its hours.
   In some areas sugar is rationed to one kilogram (2.2 pounds) per
person a month, Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   It said readers complained people must start standing in line at
6 a.m. to buy sugar in some places and that elsewhere stores can
only sell sugar to the first 200 people in a line of 500.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda blamed the ``sugar fever'' on moonshiners
who need it to produce alcohol, people trying to accumulate stocks
because of rumors of impending price increases and black marketeers
trading in the ``white gold.''
   One reader, I. Osintseva from the Tambov region of central
Russia, wrote that the price of a sack of sugar on the black market
was more than her monthly salary.
   ``But all the moonshiners buy it by the sack _ it's
profitable!'' the paper said.
   Soviet officials have denied in the official press any plans to
increase prices.
   Since Gorbachev decreed an anti-drinking campaign in May 1985,
moonshining has been on the rise to counter lowered production of
vodka and spirits and higher prices in state stores.
   In a meeting with farm workers last year, Gorbachev blamed the
sugar shortage on moonshiners, but said Soviets eat far too much
sugar anyhow _ an average of more than 40 kilograms (88 pounds) a
year, about twice what Americans eat.
   Many Soviets add large amounts of sugar to their coffee or tea,
and serve it with cake or candy.
   Last year, more than 10,000 Soviets died from drinking home brew
or spirits, and more than 500,000 people nationwide were punished
for moonshining.
   Economist Nikolai Shmelev said in an article in the April
edition of the literary journal Novy Mir that Gorbachev's
anti-alcohol campaign was a total failure because it took money
from alcohol sales out of the hands of the government and gave it
to moonshiners.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said moonshiners had to be punished
``severely.'' It said its readers also wanted order restored in the
sale of sugar.
   But it also suggested that the government's anti-drinking
campaign should be modified to cut down on moonshining.
   ``It's necessary to remove the causes that have provoked mass
moonshining, in the first place the endless lines at wine stores,''
the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   Tawana Brawley will ignore a Monday deadline
issued by a state grand jury seeking her testimony and will tell
her story to the public if no federal investigation is launched, an
adviser to her family said Wednesday.
   ``There is no way she will cooperate with Bob Abrams' grand
jury,'' the Rev. Al Sharpton said, referring to state Attorney
General Robert Abrams.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo appointed Abrams as a special prosecutor for
the Brawley case after the black teen-ager said she was a victim of
a sexual and racial assault involving six white men, one of whom
flashed a policelike badge.
   ``They can take whatever legal steps they want,'' said Sharpton,
who along with Miss Brawley's lawyers, Alton Maddox Jr. and C.
Vernon Mason, has presented the case as a civil rights issue.
   ``Unless there is an impartial federal grand jury, Ms. Brawley
will not go and stand up in front of a bogus grand jury that has
sought to protect, immunize and sanitize her assailants.''
   He said the grand jury had written to Miss Brawley and her
mother, Glenda, asking the youngster to come forward and warning
that the panel could take action to try to force her to tell her
story if she refuses to cooperate.
   The Poughkeepsie Journal reported Wednesday that the letter
contained a Monday deadline.
   ``It's dumb,'' Glenda Brawley of Wappingers Falls, near
Poughkeepsie, said of the grand jury's appeal. ``We've been through
all this before. What makes them think we're going to all of a
sudden bring Tawana down there and talk to them?''
   Mrs. Brawley reaffirmed the pledges by the family and their
lawyers that they will go to jail rather than force her to
cooperate with the grand jury.
   ``If a federal grand jury is set up, she will cooperate with
that, or she will go public. ... We still affirm those two
options,'' Sharpton said.
   Abrams' spokesman, Timothy Gilles, refused to comment, saying
grand jury matters must be kept secret.
   Miss Brawley was found on Nov. 28, after a four-day
disappearance, huddled in a trash bag with racial slurs scrawled on
her torso and feces smeared on her body.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has
filed a $2 million federal lawsuit alleging that a
telecommunications firm cheated him out of consulting fees for
arranging a contract with the Argentine military.
   Agnew's suit also accused Aydin Corporation of fraud, conspiracy
to defraud and racketeering, alleging that company officials
promised Argentine officials bribes and illegal kickbacks to secure
a telecommunications contract with the Argentine government in 1982.
   Agnew, who now runs a Maryland-based international consulting
firm called Pathlite Inc., charged that the firm did not pay him
for introducing company officials to the military leaders who ran
the country from 1976 to 1983.
   The introductions enabled Aydin to become a qualified bidder and
eventually to win the contract, according to the 37-page complaint
filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. Aydin had
agreed to compensate Agnew from the proceeds made on any contracts
that resulted from Agnew's introduction, the complaint said.
   However, Ronald Kidd, a lawyer for Aydin, said there ``was
absolutely no agreement at any time'' between Aydin and Agnew.
   Agnew filed a similar lawsuit in 1986 in federal court in New
York against Alicanto, S.A., an Argentine company that Agnew said
acted as the agent for Aydin in the dealings with the military
leaders. In that suit, Agnew charged that Alicanto had refused to
pay him from a commission it was to receive from Aydin.
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an order sought by
the plaintiffs in the 1986 suit to set aside about $340,000 in
Alicanto's assets. Attorneys said the money was sought to protect
Agnew and a co-plaintiff in the case, former Alicanto vice
president William Woolverton Jr., if Alicanto lost the 1986 suit
and moved its assets out of the United States.
   In each suit Agnew said he was owed more than $2 million for his
services. Each suit seeks triple that amount, $6.165 million, or
the $2.055 million Agnew says he is owed, plus $5 million in
punitive damages, said his lawyer, Robert P. Knapp, Jr.
   Aydin, a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Horsham,
employs more than 2,000 workers and specializes in the manufacture
and installation of large-scale communications systems.
   Agnew, the only vice president to resign in U.S. history, left
office in 1973 just before pleading no contest to federal charges
of tax evasion on $29,500 he received in 1967 while governor of
Maryland. Agnew had been elected governor in 1966.
   Since returning to private life, the former vice president has
been chief executive officer of Pathlite, providing introductions
for U.S. companies interested in gaining international contracts.

<HEAD>Pets Destroyed After Poultry-Killing Virus Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A highly contagious viral disease in poultry
and other fowl has been found in pet birds in Michigan and Nevada,
the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   No domestic poultry has been affected by the outbreak, said
James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
   But laboratory tests confirmed exotic Newcastle disease in a
three-week-old spectacled Amazon parrot and in a young yellow-naped
parrot owned by private individuals, he said.
   The birds and a number of others that were exposed to the
infected birds were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease.
   Glosser said the birds' premises in West Bloomfield, Mich., and
Las Vegas, Nev., were placed under state quarantines. Federal and
state authorities are tracing the disease to determine if
additional birds or premises may have been exposed.
   Exotic Newcastle disease can cause death rates of 50 percent to
95 percent in poultry flocks. Officials say the disease poses no
risk to humans who eat poultry or eggs, but in some cases people
who handle infected birds can contract the virus, which in humans
causes temporary eye inflammation and ``mild flu-like symptoms.''
   The most serious outbreak in the United States was in southern
California in the early 1970s, where the disease spread from
infected pet birds to commercial poultry. Nearly 12 million birds,
mostly egg-laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of $56 million
before the the disease was eradicated.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four-fifths of the nation's privately owned
housing for the poor could be lost in the next 15 years through
owners defaulting on mortgage payments or paying off mortgages
early to get around federal restrictions, a commission warned
Wednesday.
   To counter that trend, the National Low-Income Housing
Preservation Commission recommended spending an additional $11.3
billion over the 15 years to keep owners from converting the
housing into high-rent apartments or condominiums and to help
owners who are having trouble making mortgage payments. An
additional $6.4 billion would go toward continuing federal
subsidies.
   ``Everyone talks about the homeless as the tip of the iceberg,''
said Linda Parke Gallagher, executive director of the bipartisan
commission. ``We have described the iceberg. We can see the crisis
coming.''
   In a report called ``Preventing the Disappearance of Low-Income
Housing,'' prepared for the House and Senate subcommittees on
housing, the commission generally takes the tack that preserving,
and even fixing up, the current privately owned housing for the
poor is cheaper than building new housing.
   ``The average cost of saving a defaulting unit is $24,000,''
Gallagher said. ``The average cost of building new housing is
$70,000 a unit.''
   Most of the housing for the poor was built in the 1960s and
early 1970s. The problem of owner defaults is not new. Nor is the
problem of increasing real estate values in big cities, which puts
pressure on owners of low-income housing to prepay their mortgages
and convert to more lucrative high-rent apartments or condominiums.
   But the commission concludes that both trends will accelerate in
the next decade as federal rent subsidy contracts expire.
   Adding to the problem is the new federal income tax law, which
removed many of the tax incentives for investing in such housing,
the report said.
   The commission specifically looked at properties subsidized by
the Department of Housing and Urban Development with mortgages
insured by the Federal Housing Administration. That amounts to
about 645,000 units.
   Unless the federal government takes a more active role, owners
of 43 percent _ or 280,000 units _ will default and an additional
38 percent _ representing 243,000 units _ will prepay their
mortgages in the next 15 years, the commission said in its report.
   ``Everyone dealing with the project was surprised at the
projected level of default,'' Gallagher said. ``Add that together
with the prepayments and we see the number of units of low-income
housing going steadily downward.
   ``We knew we had a problem but we were surprised at the depth of
it.''
   Thomas Demery, assistant secretary for housing and federal
housing commissioner in HUD, said he supports the commission's
basic premise _ that it is better to preserve existing housing for
the poor rather than build new housing. He said he also foresees
the same troubles for the privately owned, low-income housing.
   ``I share their concern and their desire to do something,''
Demery said. ``Their report is an excellent starting point.''

<HEAD>Quarantine Reduced for Tiny Killers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal quarantine restrictions to prevent the
further spread of tiny bee mites have been reduced in Mississippi
and Washington, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   However, the tiny killer mites _ Varroa Jacobsoni _ still remain
a potential threat to the U.S. bee industry, officials said. All or
parts of 13 states remain under federal quarantine restrictions.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the revision for Mississippi
and Washington retains ``only that portion of each state that must
be quarantined to keep the Varroa mite from spreading.''
   Glosser said the statewide quarantine in Mississippi was reduced
to parts of Adams, Franklin and Wilkinson counties, while the
Washington quarantine area was reduced to part of Klickitat County.
   Varroa mites were discovered in the United States last September
in a Wisconsin apiary. Since then, they have been found in 12 other
states: Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota and
Washington.
   The original federal quarantine went into effect April 6 and
restricted the interstate movement of bees and bee equipment from
all 13 states.
   Glosser said the change in the original quarantine was partly
because both Mississippi and Washington are enforcing restrictions
on the movement of bees and bee equipment within their own borders.
   ``We also have determined that the interstate spread of Varroa
mite from Mississippi and Washington will be controlled by
maintaining the quarantine in those portions of both states that
include all known infested apiaries, as well as a border of about
100 square miles surrounding each infested apiary,'' he said.
   The mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their
developing larvae, or brood. It causes decreased brood, deformed
bees and a weakening of the colony's ability o pollinate plants and
produce honey. Infestation can occur so gradually that the mites
may not be noticed until severe damage is done.

<TEXT>
   William F. Weld, who quit as head of the
Justice Department's criminal division last month to protest
Attorney General Edwin Meese's continued presense in office, said
Wednesday he will join a prominent Boston law firm and specialize
in white-collar criminal cases.
   Weld said in that addition to becoming a senior partner at Hale
and Dorr, he will teach a course at Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School of Government on criminal law and public policy.
   The former prosecutor, who is often mentioned as a possible
Republican candidate for the Massachusetts governorship or Senate
in 1990, said he has made no decisions on his future in the
Democrat-dominated world of Massachusetts politics.
   Weld will start May 1 at Hale and Dorr's Washington office, and
then move back to his Cambridge, Mass., home in September to work
out of the Boston office.
   Jane Serene and Mark Robinson, two Weld aides in the Justice
Department who resigned with him, also will join Hale and Dorr.
They will remain at the firm's Washington office, said John
Hamilton, managing partner of the firm.
   The firm has had a series of high-profile cases, including
attorney James St. Clair's representation of President Nixon during
the Watergate scandal. Weld will become one of 85 senior partners.
   Weld resigned March 29 effective immediately. Serene and
Robinson are finishing up their work at the Justice Department and
plan to leave soon.
   Before becoming a U.S. attorney for Massachusetts in 1981, Weld
was a partner in the Boston law firm of Hill & Barlow.
   Weld and Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns resigned out of
concern that the nearly year-old criminal investigation of Meese
and the attorney general's refusal to resign were hurting the
Justice Department's operations, morale and public image.

   President Reagan congratulated George Bush
Wednesday for clinching the Republican presidential nomination but
stopped short of a public endorsement. Meanwhile, sources said
Reagan would strictly limit his role at the August convention to
avoid stealing Bush's thunder.
   Administration and party sources made the comments one day after
Bush's victory in the Pennsylvania primary pushed him past the
1,139 delegates needed for nomination at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans.
   Reagan will address the convention on opening night, Monday,
Aug. 15, but will not give the keynote address, said one source,
commenting only on condition of anonymity.
   That would vary the normal order for such conventions, the
source said, ``but I think the president's view is that this is
going to be a convention for the next nominee of the Republican
Party. It's the president's view that wherever he goes, he tends to
be the focal point, so he wants to do it this way.''
   Reagan would leave for his California ranch on Tuesday morning,
the source said.
   Another source said that there has been discussion of a Reagan
televised address to the convention on the night Bush accepts the
nomination but that no decisions have been made.
   At the White House, Reagan said he was leaning toward endorsing
Bush, but he said ``let us see'' when pressed by reporters to say
when he would formally embrace Bush's candidacy.
   ``Well, I'm going to have to arrive at that since there are no
others entering,'' the president told reporters during an Oval
Office picture-taking session with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney.
   During an interview taped for Cable News Network's ``Inside
Politics '88'' show Wednesday night, Bush said ``we've got to
discuss that, whether it will be some formal endorsement.''
   ``But when there will be some formal endorsement ceremony, we
didn't have any agreement on that,'' Bush said in the interview.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there should be no
doubt about Reagan's intentions, although the president did not
renounce the neutral stance he took at the outset of the primary
season.
   During a private lunch with Bush, Reagan ``congratulated him on
passing the magic number. They discussed the political strategy the
vice president will employ,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Reagan and Bush discussed a joint campaign
appearance sometime soon, and ``for the president to campaign for
the vice president and for them to appear together would amount to
an endorsement.''
   Reagan has spoken warmly of Bush several times in recent months,
but still has refused to break his vow of neutrality. Reagan has
publicly called Bush ``the best vice president in memory.''
   Asked whether Reagan's remarks Wednesday were tantamount to an
endorsement, Fitzwater replied: ``To me that seems fair, although
technically they are reluctant to do that, but I don't why. Maybe
because somebody might enter the race or something like that. But
for all practical purposes it does represent an endorsement.''
   Reagan tossed in a plug for Bush during a recent speech before
the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention here.
   During the course of a wide-ranging speech, and just before he
began taking questions from editors, Reagan said the administration
had made progress in fighting the flow of drugs into this country.
   ``And let me say, if you want to see effective leadership, take
a look at Vice President Bush's role in this,'' the president said.
``While others talked about leading the military into the fray
against drugs, the vice president has led.''
   Reagan's reference was to Bush's chairmanship of a
drug-interdiction task force.

   The Soviet Union and its allies ``have a
substantially greater capability'' to win a war in Europe than
NATO, according to a Pentagon assessment which one senator said
Wednesday ``raises a new warning flag.''
   ``There is an imbalance in conventional weapons in Europe, and
there's absolutely no doubt about it,'' said Sen. Dan Quayle,
R-Ind. ``This is something that we're going to have to consider as
we debate the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty next
month.''
   Quayle based his comments on portions of the annual Pentagon
publication, ``Soviet Military Power,'' which will be formally made
public Friday by the Defense Department.
   Some sections of the report have already been sent to Capitol
Hill, including the part which restates earlier comments by
Pentagon officials.
   Those officials, as part of the Senate hearings on the INF pact,
have warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization needs to
spend more money on non-nuclear weapons.
   The assessment in ``Soviet Military Power,'' released by Quayle,
said the Warsaw Pact has improved in a number of areas and now has
growing leads over NATO in a variety of weapons, including numbers
of tanks and artillery.
   ``The conclusion of the INF treaty has heightened public
awareness in the west of continuing imbalances and persisting
deficiencies in certain critical categories of NATO's conventional
forces,'' the publication said.
   The INF treaty will require both nations to eliminate all
missiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.
   The Senate is expected to consider it next month and when it
finally votes, ratification is likely since leaders of both parties
say 90 or more senators are expected to vote for it. Ratification
requires the approval of 67 of the 100 senators.
   The assessment also warned that ``although the Soviet Union is
narrowing the technological gap, the United States and its allies
maintain the technological lead.''
   ``This lead will continue to diminish, however, unless the U.S.
maintains strong safeguards against the Soviets' sophisticated
efforts to acquire technology,'' the report forecast.
   The United States still has advantages in a number of
technological areas, the report noted, including biochemical
technology, computing capability, some areas of directed energy,
and electronic materials and integrated-circuit manufacturing.
   While the West leads in a number of research areas, ``the
Soviets are methodically and efficiently transitioning new
technologies into their vast arsenal, oftentimes more rapidly than
the West,'' the report said.
   ``The Soviets already hold quantitative advantages, and are now
seeking better weapon system quality,'' it said. ``Consequently,
the comparative technological level of deployed Soviet systems is
gradually improving. This situation is the result of their forced
application of technology in shorter development cycles than are
typical in the West.''
   It also notes that the Soviets ``may soon begin limited
operational deployment of some `stealth' technologies,'' the term
used by the Air Force to describe a new generation of planes which
are designed to be virtually invisible to radars.
   The Air Force has said that its new ``stealth'' bomber will
begin testing in the fall and there have been reports, never
formally confirmed by the service, that the Air Force is also
building a ``stealth'' fighter.

   The House voted Wednesday to provide $709
million to the Veterans Administration to prevent its home mortgage
subsidy program from running out of money next week.
   The bill was passed by voice vote and sent to the Senate. The
Reagan administration supports the bill.
   The VA's Loan Guaranty Revolving Fund, depleted by a
higher-than-expected number of foreclosures on its home mortgages,
has been operating since last month on money borrowed from other
accounts within the agency.
   The bill approved Wednesday would replenish those other accounts
and provide enough money to continue the housing program through
the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30.

<HEAD>House Panel Votes To Open Alaskan Wildlife Refuge to Oil Drilling</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration and the oil industry
won another victory over environmentalists Wednesday as a House
subcommittee voted to allow petroleum development in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.
   By a 17-9 vote, the Merchant Marine subcommittee on fisheries
and wildlife conservation and the environment approved legislation
to authorize the Interior Department to sell oil leases on the 1.5
million acre coastal plain of the refuge in northeastern Alaska.
   The issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th Congress
between enviromentalists, who want no drilling in the refuge, and
the administration and oil industry, who say the plain's
potentially large reserves are needed to stem a growing national
dependence on imported oil.
   An Interior Department study says development can be carried out
in an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rival
the Prudhoe Bay complex about 70 miles to the west. Prudhoe Bay
accounts for about 20 percent of U.S. production.
   The victory in the subcommittee was the second straight for
drilling advocates and is expected to be duplicated next week when
the full Merchant Marine Committee considers the proposal by its
chairman, Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C.
   Earlier this year, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee voted 11-8 to allow oil rigs onto the refuge, where
opponents say development would spoil its pristine character and
damage wildlife habitat. The Senate bill is awaiting floor debate.
   Jones' plan would allow phased leasing, with the first sale to
occur no sooner than 21 months after enactment. No more than
300,000 acres could be leased at sales occurring no more frequently
than every two years.
   The bill would bar surface development in a 260,000 acre area
that contains about 90 percent of the land used for calving by the
180,000-head Porcupine caribou herd, which migrates between Alaska
and Canada.
   The Refuge Administration Act of 1966 requires that development
in such enclaves be compatible with the basic purpose of a refuge:
preserving wildlife habitat.
   It is up to developers to convince officials of compatibility.
Jones' bill, however, would force opponents of developing the
coastal plain to prove that such activity would have significant
and adverse long-term effects on habitat.
   The bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted from
the coastal plain and would require any ocean transport of this oil
to be done on ships registered in the United States.
   The legislation also would create a new 23.5 million-acre
Teshekpuk-Utukok National Wildlife Refuge to the west of Prudhoe
Bay and place a five-year moratorium on any petroleum leasing in
the new refuge.
   Drilling opponents repeatedly failed in attempts to amend the
bill.
   The Merchant Marine Committee is only the first hurdle drilling
legislation faces in the House. At least one other committee,
Interior, has jurisdiction over the issue.

<HEAD>Election Commission Dispenses $2 Million to Presidential
Candidates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission on Wednesday
dispensed $2 million in matching funds to current and former
presidential candidates, some of it to help retire debts of those
who have dropped out of the race.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson, who acknowledged
some time ago that his campaign was going nowhere in the face of
Vice President George Bush's march to the Republican nomination,
has received the most matching funds overall _ $8.6 million,
including $140,400 he received on Wednesday.
   Robertson technically remains a candidate.
   Bush has received $8 million in matching funds, including
$280,797 he got Wednesday.
   Both major Democratic candidates still in the race got money
Wednesday also _ Jesse Jackson, $335,154, and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, $33,964.
   To be eligible for money from the matching fund, a candidate
must raise $100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $250 or
less, with at least $5,000 from each state.
   Thereafter, the federal Treasury matches each contribution of
$250 or less that a candidate collects from private sources.
   Candidates who drop out are still eligible to receive matching
funds to help pay off their debts and wind down their campaigns.
   The matching fund is supported by the $1 voluntary checkoff on
individual income tax forms.
   The amounts received Wednesday by candidates, including some no
longer in the running, followed by their cumulative matching fund
totals are:
   Bush, $280,797, $8 million.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., $140,888, $7.2 million.
   Dukakis, $33,964, $6.8 million.
   Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, $49,976, $2.5 million.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., $24,586, $2.65 million.
   Jackson, $335,154, $2.7 million.
   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., $5 million.
   Lyndon LaRouche, $507,460, $607,460.
   Robertson, $140,400, $8.6 million.

<TEXT>
   The wildlife death toll from Shell Oil's
175,000-gallon spill rose Wednesday to at least 130 birds and
dozens of small animals as the thick crude oozed through fragile
coastal wetlands.
   Larry Kolb, principal engineer of the state Regional Water
Quality Control Board, called Saturday's spill during the nesting
season an ``ecological disaster'' in which damaged areas may take a
year or more to recover.
   The Audubon Society, an environmental group, said the worst-hit
marshes, flanking Peyton Slough just below the Shell refinery,
might take decades to recover.
   The size of the spill was revised upward Tuesday as waterborne
skimmers and vacuum pumps working day and night recovered about
44,000 gallons, said Brian Hunter, regional manager of the state
Department of Fish and Game.
   Shell initially estimated 21,000 gallons escaped through a
damaged drain atop a Shell holding tank.
   Hunter said 130 birds were dead, including some of about 400
rescued for cleaning. At least two dozen turtles, marsh mice and
muskrats were also found dead.
   Coast Guard helicopters assisted in spotting the unrefined oil,
which on Wednesday stretched in pockets and spotty concentrations
some 12 miles from Ryer Island, east through Carquinez Strait and
1{ miles into San Pablo Bay.
   More than 100 workers raced against natural deadlines to clean
up the area. On Saturday, an exceptionally high tide of 5.5 feet
will spread whatever oil is left, and predicted rain also could
slosh the goo into clear water, Kolb said.
   Officials of the state Department of Fish and Game expressed
concern the oil might contaminate Grizzly Bay. The bay is typically
calm and warm, making it a major incubator for fish and plants.
   Kolb said the spill could cost Shell, which has acknowledged
responsibility, $3 million or more in penalties in addition to $1
million for the cleanup and hundreds of thousands of dollars for
refinishing oil-damaged boat bottoms.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
formally scrapped an unpopular proposal that would have raised
telephone charges substantially for computer users.
   In its order, the FCC concluded ``this is not an appropriate
time'' to levy interstate access charges on providers of
information services because the industry is in a ``uniquely
complex period of transition.''
   The commission, which voted last week on the action and released
the text of its order Wednesday, is considering plans by the local
Bell telephone companies to give equal access to information
providers. These plans could change the way information services
are provided over the local networks.
   ``It would be prudent to defer consideration of our proposal ...
until we are more certain of the effects'' of the Bell companies'
interconnection plans, the FCC said.
   The agency's plan would have added about $4.50 an hour to the
cost for a computer user to link up electronically with an
information provider. That cost would more than double the hourly
hookup price for some data bases.
   The FCC proposal would have extended to computer users the same
access charges now paid by long-distance companies for access to
the local phone network. The long-distance companies pass these
charges along to callers in their rates.
   The agency, when it adopted the long-distance access charges in
1982, exempted information service providers from the fees because
of the fear that the new industry would not withstand the sudden
increase in costs.
   The commission found virtually no support for its plan. Computer
users said the increased costs would drive many of them off the
computer networks and crush a fledgling industry.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, said in a statement the FCC's
action ``will remove a serious threat to the health of the enhanced
services industry.''

<HEAD>No Hard Feelings, Veterans Say, But Soviet Students Can't March In
Parade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No hard feelings, but veterans groups
don't want Soviet students marching in the Memorial Day parade next
month even if it does fall during Soviet-American Friendship Week,
the parade's organizers said Wednesday.
   About 20 members of the Greenfield Patriotic Societies voted in
a show of hands last week against letting 10 young Soviet visitors
march in the May 30 parade. The group, which sponsors the parade,
is a coalition of eigth veterans organizations.
   Coalition president Mark Fitzpatrick, who was recently hired by
this town of 18,000 in northwestern Massachusetts to help local
veterans, said the nearly unanimous vote reflected the personal
feelings of those who fought against Soviet-aided enemies in the
Korean and Vietnam wars.
   ``There is no political statement made from this vote,'' said
Fitzpatrick. ``There is nothing other than a feeling that it is
inappropriate for these kids to march.''
   Fitzpatrick said the request to allow the teen-agers to march
was made by Jennifer Shikes, who is coordinating their week-long
trip to the region for the Traprock Peace Center in nearby
Deerfield.
   Shikes said she accepted the veterans' decision, adding that she
realized only after making the request that the Greenfield parade
was predominantly for veterans, not for all community groups. ``A
lot of the points brought up were well taken,'' she said.
   The students will be in the United States on an exchange program
sponsored by International Arts for Peace that will also take them
to Boston and New York. In honor of their visit, Greenfield
selectmen voted to declare the week a time of friendship between
the two superpowers.
   International Arts for Peace is a non-profit international
student exchange organization based in Brookline.
   One of the purposes of the visit is for the Soviet students to
work with a group of American teen-agers to write a peace statement
to be delivered to the United Nations in June, Shikes said. The
Traprock center contacted the Brookline group about serving as host
for the western Massachusetts leg of the visit.
   The students will be staying in private homes in and around
Greenfield.
   Local veterans pointed out that at least 20 events have been
planned in the county just for the visit, including a barbeque and
pizza party.
   ``I love kids. I work with them all the time. It's just the
idea,'' said William Phelps, commander of American Legion Post 81,
who was a Green Beret in the Vietnam War. ``Let them have their own
little parade, but not on Memorial Day.''
   William Peloskey, commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars John
F. Harrington Post 417, agreed.
   ``Personally, I have mixed emotions for the simple reason that
they're kids,'' said Pelosky, who served in the Pacific in World
War II, when the Soviet Union was a U.S. ally.
   But he added: ``As far as the unit is concerned, because we have
so many veterans from various wars, definitely we will not let the
youngsters march with us.''

Canada</HEAD>

   The United States has told Canada it won't
agree to bar increases in northbound flow of nitrogen oxides, an
important cause of acid rain, an Environmental Protection Agency
official said Wednesday.
   In United Nations-sponsored negotiations in Geneva, the United
States is seeking the right to emit about 20 percent more nitrogen
oxides than it now does, said Sheldon Meyers, EPA's acting
associate administrator for international programs.
   Meyers said the United States wants credit for earlier
unilateral efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. A 1979
treaty calls for reductions in cross-border flows of air pollution
``taking into account the efforts already made.''
   The United States refused to seek such a credit in another treat
last fall aimed at safeguarding the earth's protective ozone layer.
   The 20 percent increase in nitrogen oxide emissions would be
compensation for the efforts and achievements of the existing U.S.
control program, which has reduced ground-level concentrations of
nitrogen oxides by 14 percent since 1975 and emissions by 8.5
percent since 1978, Meyers said.
   Nitrogen oxide, an important component of auto emissions, later
turns into nitric acid in the atmosphere, and along with sulfuric
acid from sulfur dioxide emissions creates the acid rain which
environmentalists blame for the death of aquatic life in sensitive
lakes and streams.
   ``There's no question that absent our control program, we would
have much higher nitrogen oxide emissions,'' and the United States
believes other countries should catch up before it undertakes new
commitments, Meyers said.
   Earlier negotiations resulted in international agreement in 1985
to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 30 percent, an agreement the
United States has declined to join.
   Both sulfur and nitrogen oxides are emitted by coal-burning
power plants and factory boilers. In the eastern United States and
Canada, sulfur accounts for two-thirds of the excess acidity in
rainfall and has been believed more damaging to lakes and streams.
   Half of Canada's acid rain originates in the United States, and
Canada for years has pressed for additional U.S. action against the
precursors of acid rain.
   Due to auto emission standards imposed in the United States in
1975, a new car today emits only one-fourth the nitrogen oxides of
cars made before that. Canada adopted U.S. auto emission standards
in 1985, and most European countries are only beginning to
contemplate such controls.
   But U.S. emissions are expected to increase again around 1995
because of more travel by more cars. Thus, Meyers said, ``There's
no way we can agree'' to a Canadian proposal to accept the U.S.
position permitting higher emissions in exchange for a commitment
not to increase cross-border flow of nitrogen oxides.
   In fact, said Meyers, the United States does not believe such
flows can be measured. Canada, he said, ``uses a (computer) model
we say is not accurate. It's very simplistic.''
   During talks leading up to the September international treaty
calling for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of
chlorofluorocarbon compounds that attack the ozone layer, U.S.
negotiators declined to seek credit for emissions reductions
resulting from the 1978 U.S. ban on use of these chemicals as
aerosol propellants.
   The CFC negotiations were not comparable, Meyers said: The 1978
aerosol reductions ``were minor. These (nitrogen oxide reductions)
are not minor.''
   Canada also has sought a treaty with the United States limiting
U.S. sulfur dioxide ``exports'' to 2.2 million tons, compared with
about 4 million tons today. The United States has not agreed.
   According to EPA estimates, the United States emitted 21.3
million tons of nitrogen oxides in 1986 and 23.3 million tons in
1978, the peak year. Canadian emissions were 9 percent of the U.S.
total in 1980. EPA expects U.S. emissions in the year 2000 to be
above 22 million tons.
   Meyers' revelation drew this criticism from Rep. James Florio,
D-N.J., a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
considering, for the fifth straight year, various measures against
acid rain:
   ``For too long the administration has talked about research when
it was clear that what was needed was action. Now they are talking
about increasing by 4 million tons a year the amount of nitrogen
oxide that is released into the air. It simply does not make
sense.''

   Three of five Nuclear Regulatory Commission
members favor doing away with their own jobs and replacing the
panel with a single administrator, the agency's chairman said
Wednesday.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech told the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee that he and two other commissioners believe a single
administrator would enhance responsibility and accountability at
the top of the agency.
   ``We are before you ... in a sense recommending that our jobs be
eliminated.'' Zech said. ``The commission is functioning in a very
good manner; we simply think it could function a lot better. We're
frustrated, as you can tell.''
   NRC Commissioner Frederick Bernthal said the current system ``is
tying us in knots.''
   ``It leads to fragmented and ultimately flawed decisions,'' said
Bernthal. ``In my judgment, the principle of checks and balances
must be reintroduced, and accountability has to be restored in
order to remedy the situation.''
   Commissioner Thomas Roberts also supports the idea of a new
administrator but commissioners Kenneth Carr and Kenneth Rogers
oppose it, officials for the agency said.
   A bill by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.,
would replace the NRC with a Nuclear Safety Agency structured much
like the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The new agency would be headed by a single presidentially
appointed administrator who must be confirmed by the Senate.
   The legislation also would establish an independent inspector
general to review allegations of fraud and abuse and a safety board
to investigate accidents at nuclear power plants.
   Breaux said there is ``a crying need'' to reorganize the NRC in
order to ``rebuild the confidence of the American people.''
   Up to 90 percent of the commission's decisions are made without
the commissioners even meeting together, Simpson said.
   ``The notion of collegial decision-making is a myth, an absolute
myth,'' he said.
   The General Accounting Office also had endorsed the idea of
abolishing the commission in favor an agency headed by one person
instead of five.
   Dexter Peach, assistant comptroller general for the GAO, said a
single administrator could respond more quickly and efficiently to
day-to-day regulatory problems and decisions.
   Zech said the commission does not oppose a nuclear safety board
in a single-administrator agency as long it remains part of the
agency. He said the commission also has no objection to a
congressionally required inspector general for the NRC.

<NOTE>EDs: UPDATES with new grafs 8-9 on Reagan convention plans;

<TEXT>
   George Bush, the apparent Republican presidential nominee, and
his likely Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis set a combative tone
for the campaign Wednesday, with Dukakis saying Bush has ``some
explaining to do'' on the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Let him fire away,'' Bush challenged.
   Both said they looked forward to debates.
   The other Democrat still in the race, Jesse Jackson, gamely
looked ahead to the next round of primaries in Ohio and Indiana.
Despite Dukakis' huge victory in Pennsylvania on Tuesday and
growing delegate lead, Jackson said the race wasn't over.
   ``I keep struggling against the odds, and I've always struggled
against the odds and succeeded,'' Jackson said on ABC-TV. ``This
campaign will remain alive. It will go right down to the wire in
California and New Jersey on June 7.''
   Bush locked up the Republican nomination, passing the required
1,139-delegate mark with an easy win in Pennsylvania against a
field that had long since withered.
   He lunched privately with President Reagan, who indicated the
time was nearing for a formal endorsement of his vice president.
   Administration and Republican Party sources, meanwhile, said
Reagan planned to strictly limit his role at the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans in August to avoid stealing
Bush's thunder.
   Reagan will address the convention on opening night, Monday,
Aug. 15, then leave the next day for California, according to
sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Both Bush and Dukakis said they would continue their
primary-campaign efforts. But they were already providing a preview
of the fall general election campaign with a long-distance debate
on foreign policy and other issues through network TV interviews.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, opened fire on Bush's role
in the Iran-Contra affair. Bush has suggested he would be a better
choice as president because he has foreign policy experience that
Dukakis lacks..
   The governor said, ``All we know is that he sat there and did
nothing while we engaged in one of the worst and one of the most
misguided adventures in the history of American foreign policy,'' a
reference of the arms-for-hostages dealing directed by White House
officials.
   ``I can't imagine what they were thinking of when they proceeded
to do business with a terrorist nation,'' Dukakis added. ``There's
somebody in the administration, including the vice president, who's
got some explaining to do.''
   Bush said he would ask Dukakis in debate what he would do about
hostages in the Middle East. ``Do you really care when a man like
Buckley is being tortured to death?'' he said he would ask, a
reference to William Buckley, the CIA official who died after being
taken hostage in Lebanon.
   Bush said he would continue to campaign in the remaining GOP
primaries, despite his clinching of the nomination. ``I don't want
to project an overconfidence or an arrogance that I don't feel,''
he said.
   He said he ``absolutely, no question about it'' would debate the
Democratic nominee.
   Dukakis said, ``I've already agreed to. I don't think he has.
... I'd be delighted. I like debating.''
   At the same time, a commission formed by the major political
parties revealed plans for four debates between Sept. 14 and Oct.
27.
   ``While commitments have not yet been received from all the
presidential candidates to debate under the auspices of our
commission, we believe the commission ... is best situated to
attract the candidates,'' commission co-chairmen Paul G. Kirk and
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., Democratic and GOP chiefs respectively,
said in a joint statement.
   The parties' commission faces competition for control of this
fall's presidential debates from the League of Women Voters, which
has said it will sponsor three debates of its own.
   
   Jackson, campaigning in Ohio, took on both men on an issue he
has tried to bring to the forefront of the campaign. ``I challenge
Mike Dukakis and George Bush to define South Africa as a terrorist
state that conducts and sponsors terrorism,'' he said.
   Talk in both parties was of vice presidential nominees.
   Jackson appeared to indicate that conservative Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, supported for the ticket by many Democratic leaders, might
not be acceptable. He mentioned no names and framed his comments in
terms of a running mate for himself, making what seemed to be a
reference to Nunn's opposition to some civil rights legislation and
to the Equal Rights Amendement.
   ``Whoever I would have on my ticket would have to have a good
record in civil rights, women's rights, social justice, and a real
pronounced commitment to peace in this world,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis called it ``too early'' to think about Jackson or anyone
else for a running mate.
   Bush suggested he saw no need to announce a running mate before
the Republican convention in August. ``I want to watch and see what
the Democrats do,'' he said.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Dukakis ally, said Nunn or Florida
Sen. Bob Graham would be ``great'' on the ticket with Dukakis and
also suggested the name of Arkansas Sen. Dale Bumpers.
   Asked about himself as a running mate, Clinton said in an
interview: ``I guess I could help him in the South and sing a good
song ... but I think my hunch is he'd be better off with a senator,
and I think that's what he'll end up doing.''

   Americans' personal incomes, boosted by
profit-sharing payments in the auto industry, posted the biggest
gain last month since December, while consumer spending jumped a
healthy 0.7 percent, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said personal incomes climbed 0.8
percent in March after a 0.6 percent gain in February. It was the
best increase since an identical 0.8 percent advance in December.
   Analysts said spending and income figures showed that the
consumer, who cut back on purchases immediately following the
October stock market crash, had rebounded and was continuing to
propel overall economic growth.
   In reporting Tuesday on the gross national product, the
government said the consumer was the biggest source of strength
during the first three months of the year. Consumer spending rose
at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation,
during the quarter.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, had declined by 2.5 percent in the final three
months of 1987, raising fears that if Americans stopped spending,
especially for big-ticket items, the nation could be pushed into a
recession.
   ``There is no serious consumer retrenchment going on. People are
still willing to buy,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the
Futures Group, an economic forecasting firm in Washington. ``We
shouldn't face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest
of the year.''
   Ms. Shaber predicted that consumer spending would rise at a
modest 2 percent annual rate for the entire year, about the same as
in 1987.
   The 0.8 percent March increase in incomes would have been a much
smaller 0.2 percent if special factors including an annual bonus
for auto workers had been excluded.
   The average $2,500 payment to 108,000 Ford Motor Co. employees
accounted for more than half of the increase in wages and salaries
last month, which rose 0.5 percent in March, the government said.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass., said that with unemployment now at a nine-year low of 5.6
percent, the modest increase in wages for the month was good news.
He said it showed the economy is not beginning to see inflationary
pressures from rising wage demands.
   ``Wages are rising at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent to 3
percent, which is still low by historical standards,'' Wyss said.
   In all, personal incomes rose $29.6 billion to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.92 trillion. Personal consumption
spending, which includes virtually everything except interest
payments on debt, rose $21.8 billion to an annual rate of $3.19
trillion.
   Disposable, or after-tax, incomes were up as well, climbing 0.6
percent in March following a 0.8 percent February increase.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, dipped slightly last month to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent
in February, although both months showed an improvement from the
3.7 percent average savings rate in 1987.
   The spending advance came in the categories of non-durable goods
and services. Durable goods, items such as cars that are expected
to last at least three years, edged down $300 million during March
after a huge $9.2 billion rise in February.
   But purchases of non-durable goods were up $9.8 billion while
purchases of services, which include housing costs, rose $12.2
billion.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet teams began final negotiations
Wednesday on verification provisions for a 12-year-old unratified
treaty limiting the strength of non-military nuclear explosions.
   Agreement on those provisions is intended to set the stage for
an accord by fall on monitoring a 1974 treaty that sets limits on
nuclear weapons tests.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union and
Secretary of State George P. Shultz approved plans for on-site
monitoring last week in Moscow.
   They told negotiators to have a verification protocol to the
1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty ready for signature by
President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their Moscow summit
May 29-June 2.
   U.S. negotiators expect both treaties to be ready for submission
to the Senate by mid-September, said C. Paul Robinson, chief of the
American team.
   He said they will contain ``verification tools that can't be
cheated on.'' Robinson said safeguards also were being designed to
make sure neither side could obtain confidential data on the design
of the other's nuclear charges through test-monitoring devices.
   Both sides introduced proposed verification measures over the
past month.
   ``It's got us moving very closely toward each other. It's quite
encouraging,'' Robinson said. ``There's very little time, but we've
gotten a lot behind us.''
   Efforts to clear the last hurdles, which Robinson would not
identify, began Wednesday after a break for the Shultz-Shevardnadze
meeting.
   Finishing work on the peaceful explosions pact got priority
because negotiators agreed that data from joint experimental
explosions at each country's test site were not needed, Robinson
said.
   Experience with each side's monitoring techniques will be
awaited before the delegations complete a protocol on monitoring
military tests, for which both sides also have presented drafts.
   The first experiment is scheduled for mid-July at the U.S. site
in the Nevada desert. The other is to be held at the Soviet Union's
Semipalatinsk test range in mid-August.
   Both the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty limit explosions to 150 kilotons.
   Neither was ratified by the Senate because they were felt to be
unenforceable. Both sides claim to have observed the agreements but
the Reagan administration says the Soviets ``likely'' exceeded the
limit on some tests.
   The U.S.-Soviet negotiations began in November with a test ban
as their long-term goal. In the U.S. view, testing is needed as
long as nuclear weapons exist.

   Sen. Paul Simon and his wife, Jeanne, held
assets of $361,978 and had a net worth of $142,735 at the end of
1987, the Illinois Democrat said Wednesday.
   Simon, who has suspended his presidential campaign, released a
detailed financial statement showing the couple boosted their net
worth by about $4,000 from the $138,891 reported in 1986, largely
because of reduction in liabilities.
   The disclosure statement is far more detailed than those members
of Congress must submit each year, aides to the senator said.
   ``He's set the pace for public officials nationwide on
disclosure, issuing these statements since he first took office in
1955'' in the Illinois House, said Simon's press secretary, David
Carle. ``It's a record that is unmatched and one of the things he's

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis has
a wide lead among Democrats likely to vote in West Virginia's
presidential primary May 10, according to a state poll released
Wednesday.
   Dukakis, front-runner for the Democratic nomination, was picked
by 43 percent of the Democrats surveyed for the poll, while
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. got 15 percent and Jesse Jackson
received 14 percent. The poll was conducted before Gore suspended
his campaign following a third-place finish in the April 19 New
York primary.
   Among likely voters in the Republican primary, Vice President
George Bush, who has clinched the GOP nomination, received support
from 72 percent of those polled, while 7 percent backed Pat
Robertson, who had reduced his campaigning.
   The copyright West Virginia Poll is conducted for The Associated
Press, Charleston Daily Mail and WSAZ-TV by Ryan-Samples Research
Inc. Results are based on telephone interviews conducted April
13-18 with 500 West Virginians selected at random. The overall
margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percent.

<HEAD>Jewish Leaders Seeking Session With Jackson</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Local Jewish leaders want to meet with Jesse
Jackson before the June 7 California Democratic presidential
primary in an attempt to avoid the kind of clashing that occurred
in New York but others say it may be too late.
   Rabbi Alan Freeling of the Reform University Synagogue said
Tuesday that Jackson's California campaign officials have indicated
a meeting may be scheduled during the first two weeks in May.
   ``What I'm looking at is those issues on his social agenda and
those issues important to the Jewish social agenda, and where they
coincide and differ,'' Freeling said.
   But Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, said it's too late to mend fences with Jackson.
   ``Since 1984, Reverend Jackson has had a very long period of
time to work at mending fences with the American Jewish
community,'' Cooper said. ``On a practical basis, he has not done
much.''

<HEAD>Evans Gives Bush Some Advice On Strategy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., has given George Bush
some issues advice for his presidential campaign, but a
conservative activist says the vice president should ignore the
suggestions.
   Evans advised Bush in a letter to de-emphasize some key Reagan
administration policies and strive to appeal to young, moderate
voters.
   Evans said Monday that the letter did not urge Bush to repudiate
much of the Reagan agenda but did advise Bush that ``it's important
to ensure that the (GOP) convention doesn't veer sharply to the
right and embarrass you and the party as we move toward the
November election.''
   Evans' letter said: ``Don't squander your credibility on issues
like school prayer and a balanced budget amendment, but rather
focus on those programs which can bring new hope to people and new
opportunity for our free-enterprise system.''
   In an April 5 response to Evans, Bush called the letter
``superb'' and said ``I agree with most of the suggestions.''
   Robert Grant, chairman of the conservative lobby Christian
Voice, issued a statement Tuesday saying the proposals posed a
``serious threat to a GOP victory in November.''
   ``He (Evans) obviously doesn't understand that conservative
platform planks got Ronald Reagan elected to two consecutive
terms,'' Grant said.
   ``If the vice president takes in this advice and abandons these
Reagan principles, he will incur the risk of losing the
enthusiastic support of the conservative wing of the Republican
Party,'' Grant said.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Consent Decrees On All-Terrain Vehicles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday approved with
several modifications proposed consent decrees to regulate
all-terrain vehicles blamed for nearly 1,000 deaths and 300,000
injuries in the last five years.
   The settlement between the Consumer Product Safety Commission
and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and
lawmakers as not providing adequate protection or compensation for
owners of the vehicles known as ATVS.
   But Gesell said: ``No decree designed to protect consumers has
ever gone this far in meeting such a massive national consumer
problem.''
   The settlement was approved after the judge persuaded attorneys
for the CPSC and the manufacturers to agree to several changes in
the order that satisfy objections he made at an April 18 hearing.
   The revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed
the CPSC to initiate a general recall only if it found ``new and
substantial evidence'' that the vehicles were hazardous.
   It also bars the CPSC from initiating a so-called generic recall
of ATVs before Dec. 31, 1990. The original decree empowered the
agency to take such action a year after the agreement received
court approval.
   CPSC general counsel James V. Lacy said the change ``clarifies
the evidentiary standard but provides a longer period of time to
allow the agreement to work.''
   The elimination of the ``substantial evidence'' wording was
hailed by Katherine Meyer, an attorney who represented a variety of
consumer and health groups, including the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association.
   ``Under the decree as it was previously written, the CPSC could
not do anything further unless it came up with new and substantial
evidence'' of safety hazards, Meyer said. Such a standard
``excluded a failure to reduce deaths and injuries.''
   ``It was a major problem we had with the decree,'' she said.
   The consent decrees between the commission and the five
manufacturers bans the sale of three-wheel ATVs unless the
manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by
the CPSC.
   It also requires warning labels on four-wheel models.
Distributors must provide training in the safe use of all types of
ATVs to owners who purchased the vehicles after Dec. 30. 1986.
   It also requires the manufacturers to spend $8.5 million to warn
consumers about the hazards of ATVs and promote the training.
   There are an estimated 2.4 million ATVs in use in this country,
including 1.5 million three-wheel models.
   CPSC chairman Terrence M. Scanlon said in a statement that he
was ``personally gratified that the federal district court agreed
that the commission's all-terrain vehicle settlement is in the
public interest,''
   ``Had the consent decree not been signed, years of protracted
and uncertain litigation would have followed,'' he said.
   ``With nearly 1,000 ATV-related deaths and more than 300,000
hospital emergency room injuries already recorded _ many to
children under 16 _ such a delay would have come at an unacceptebly
high cost,'' he said.
   Critics, including members of Congress and the attorneys general
of 32 states, contended the agreement was flawed because it didn't
require the manufacturers to give owners a refund for ATVs they
decided they no longer wanted.
   ``The settlement is only a beginning because it fails to include
any real remedy for the million and a half people who are stuck
with especially hazardous three-wheel ATVs,'' Rep. James Florio,
D-N.J., said in a statement.
   Florio is sponsoring legislation that would require
manufacturers to make refunds.
   Ms. Meyer said that although the groups she represents ``are
pleased about the decree'' they will continue to lobby Congress to
enact a refund bill.
   Another modification requires the distributors to require
dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of
the hazards, specifically to children, of ATVs and to ensure the
vehicles bear the required safety labels.
   The original decree had required the manufacturers to make their
``best efforts'' to get the dealers to implement these requirements.
   Other changes include a requirement that CPSC maintain a central
repository of consumer complaints and other reports to enable the
public and the agency to determine how the consent decree is
working.
   The agency's general counsel is also required to make a public
filing to explain why he has granted any extensions in compliance
deadlines that are longer than six weeks.
   One consent decree is with four Japanese firms and their
American divisions _ Honda Motor Co. Ltd, Yamaha Motor Co. LTD,
Susuki Motors Co. LTD. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries LTD. The other
decree is with Polaris Industries, a U.S.-based manufacturer.

   ``Fascist Vermin'' sold to a graying gentleman in
an elegant blazer. A blonde in a chic Chanel suit bid for ``Long
Live the Worker's Struggle.''
   An auction of 119 posters designed for the May 1968 student
uprising drew hundreds of people to the Drouot auction house, where
on Wednesday a well-established crowd paid high prices for the
anti-establishment works.
   Television cameras filled the back of the room. Nostalgia filled
the air.
   ``I came to buy the posters I had on my wall when I was a
student,'' said Jean-Claude Cosneau. He was outbid by an art
collector who paid $540 for the ``Fascist Vermine'' graphic of a
mean and mangy rat.
   ``I got that poster last time for free,'' said Cosneau, 37,
shaking his balding head in wonder.
   The brightly colored, unsigned works _ some pierced with holes
or marked by Scotch tape _ brought up to $720 each.
   Auctioneer Pierre Cornette de Saint-Cyr, wearing jeans and a
T-shirt with the slogan ``We Are All Undesirable,'' said the
posters were ``beautiful graphics and not just documents of
history.''
   The auction, the first of two, coincided with the 20th
anniversary of the 1968 revolt _ a war of words as well as action.
   At night, students battled police in the Left Bank of Paris. By
day, they designed revolutionary art and scrawled slogans on the
city's walls.
   ``The general will against the will of the general,''
``Imagination power'' and dozens of other phrases covered the walls
of the Sorbonne university and the subway.
   Although the graffiti was soon washed away, many of the posters
survived. The best of these, which combined youthful passion with
humor and skill, were auctioned Wednesday. Many were the work of
students at the Ecole des Beaux Arts (School of Fine Arts).
   On May 8, 1968, the usually apolitical students of the Ecole des
Beaux Arts went on strike, as thousands of students across the
country were doing. Students took control of the Ecole's buildings
six days later and set up the Atelier Populaire (Popular Art
Studio).
   Every day, a group would gather at the school to choose a few
important themes, and designers worked on sketches that were then
critiqued.
   These students rejected the idea of art for art's sake and
denounced ``bourgeois culture'' and fame and fortune for artists.
   Art was to be put ``at the service of the struggle'' and should
be anonymous, they said.
   Thousands of posters promoting the revolution were
silk-screened, quickly and cheaply, and distributed throughout the
French capital.
   To their dismay, the protesters found their work was collected
for its commercial worth.
   Collectors appreciated the grim humor of the works that
juxtaposed familiar symbols. One poster showed the press as a
bottle of poison and bore the slogan ``Do not swallow.'' Another,
which read ``Return to normal,'' was illustrated with a flock of
sheep. A third showed President Charles De Gaulle in a police
helmet.
   The students complained in a statement that using the posters
for decorative rather than political purposes was ``a betrayal.''
   Times have certainly changed.
   Louis Aubry, who now owns a gallery on the Left Bank, designed
one of the posters auctioned Wednesday while he was a student at
the Ecole des Beaux Arts.
   ``The crowd here today is evidence that the epoch was
important,'' said Aubry. ``And in a society that sells everything,
this is to be expected.''

<BYLINE>FBI: Cyanide Defendant's Fingerprints Found In Posion Book
``Deadly Harvest''
^By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI specialist said Wednesday that a library
book about poisons entitled ``Deadly Harvest'' had 84 fingerprints
of Stella Nickell, who is accused of killing her husband and
another woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin.
   Carl E. Collins, a fingerprint specialist, said the prints were
found on 47 pages of the book and in the poison subject entries of
three encyclopedia volumes at the library.
   Collins' testimony ended the prosecution's case against Mrs.
Nickell, 44, who is the first person in this country to stand trial
for causing death by tampering with over-the-counter medicine.
   A similar case involving Tylenol in the Chicago area resulted in
seven deaths but has never been solved.
   Her attorney says the U.S. District Court jury hearing the
8-day-old trial will get to hear Mrs. Nickell tell her own story.
   Attorney Tom Hillier began her defense with a doctor explaining
the autopsy of 52-year-old Bruce Nickell and a social worker who
described Mrs. Nickell's behavior as her husband lay dying.
   The defendant sobbed as Dr. Dennis Reichenbach of Harborview
Medical Center in Seattle described details of the autopsy.
   Bruce W. Stone, a former social worker at Harborview, said Mrs.
Nickell seemed withdrawn as she sat in the emergency waiting room,
but that this was not unusual.
   After repeated questions from Assistant U.S. Attorney Joanne
Maida, Stone said he couldn't remember whether Mrs. Nickell
declined to go to her husband's bedside as he lay dying in June
1986.
   Prosecutors have portrayed Mrs. Nickell as an unhappy wife in a
marriage beset by financial problems.
   They contend she plotted to collect insurance money from her
husband's death and spiked other pain-killing capsules with cyanide
so as to make his death appear the work of a random killer.
   Bottles of tainted pain-killing capsules were placed on the
shelves of drug stores near the Nickells' home, prosecutors said.
   Mrs. Nickell is also accused in the death of Sue Katherine Snow,
40, of Auburn, who also died in June 1986 after swallowing a
cyanide-laced Excedrin.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Nickell's daughter, Cindy Hamilton, testified
that her mother discussed copying the Tylenol episodes in the
Chicago area and also asked how to hire a hit man and where she
could buy heroin.
   Ms. Hamilton, 28, said her mother told her she had considered
putting cocaine in Nickell's iced tea to make it appear he
overdosed and that one murder attempt, involving toxic seeds in a
capsule, failed.
   ``I know my mother very well, and basically, I knew she was
capable of it,'' Ms. Hamilton sobbed on the witness stand. ``But I
was hoping she wouldn't.''
   Prosecutors say Mrs. Nickell's effort to make the deaths of her
husband and Ms. Snow look like randem murders began to unravel when
Ms. Hamilton went to authorities.
   Mrs. Nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in
Extra-Strength Excedrin and Anacin-3 bottles that were recovered in
stores in Auburn and nearby Kent.

   Since Lonnie Gaddy started shining shoes at CBS
headquarters 25 years ago, he's heard the footsteps. And now that
he's 75, they've finally caught up with him.
   Gaddy, whose shines were so treasured he was sent to political
conventions in 1972 and 1984, is hanging up the soft cloth and
polish.
   ``I'm so happy I don't know what to do,'' he said before his
last day Wednesday.
   ``His motto is, `When Lonnie talks, leather listens,''' said CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees. She said Gaddy has a reputation for being
able to tell who is walking past his stand without even looking up.
   ``I sure can,'' Gaddy said with pride. He said he developed the
ability to recognize footsteps after he looked up once to say hello
to someone while he was polishing a shoe and accidentally got
polish on a white sock.
   ``I said, `Gee whiz, I can't be putting polish on people's
socks.' I discovered each person's footstep and I didn't have to
turn around,'' he said.
   Once named the best shoeshine person in New York by a local
magazine, Gaddy quickly became a fixture at CBS, where he shined
the shoes of everyone from top executives to the man who sweeps the
floor and from soap opera stars to Walter Cronkite, whom he credits
with helping build his business.
   ``He used to get a shine every day. People would go by the door
and come and talk to him and they would get on the stand and get a
shine. That's how I built up a big business,'' he said.
   He recalled that Cronkite always told him, ```Lonnie, that's a
good shine.' Then all the other customers followed.''
   Born in West Palm Beach, Fla., Gaddy went north when he got an
offer to repair shoes. He settled in New York in 1939. As he left
the network, he got the spit and polish treatment from others.
   On Tuesday, Dan Rather shined his shoes. Gaddy also was featured
on the ``CBS Morning News,'' and Charles Osgood wrote a poem about
him.
   ``He was just beaming,'' Ms. Dees said. ``It's kind of hard to
tell when he's happy because he's always happy. Today, he was
exceptionally happy.''
   ``There really aren't enough words to say about him,'' said ``60
Minutes'' correspondent Mike Wallace. ``Everyone simply loves
Lonnie. He's part of the CBS family.''

   George Bush, with the Republican nomination in
hand, will use the summer months before the GOP convention to
broaden his appeal to the Democrats who put Ronald Reagan in office
and refine his message beyond loyalty to the president.
   Reflecting advice given by people outside the campaign, Bush
will ``make a full-fledged effort to make sure the party is
united,'' Lee Atwater, his top campaign aide, said in an interview.
   Bush, the day after clinching the 1,139 convention delegates
needed to win the nomination, said in television interviews he was
anxious to take on likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   But in the next several weeks, Bush will be ``fine-tuning his
message'' during appearances in states with remaining primaries and
caucuses, Atwater said. He would not, however, discuss specific
strategy.
   Several Republicans said in interviews they believe Bush ran
away with the nomination by exploiting longstanding commitments
from GOP officials and officeholders. But they also said the time
has come for Bush to spell out his views more clearly.
   ``The biggest mistake the Republican Party and its candidates
can do is to go out and say, `Look what we've done these past eight
years,'' said party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf. ``Voters
appropriately have short memories. He must not only build on the
record of the past eight years, but talk about the future.''
   Fahrenkopf also said he hopes that Bush will talk about ``some
of the issues that have not gotten as much attention'' as foreign
policy, defense and economics.
   He suggested that Bush should work to broaden his appeal to
women voters. While the Republican Party has stood for protecting
family values, Fahrenkopf said, ``that doesn't mean that the
Republican Party and George Bush are not going to have to take a
look at things like child care.''
   Bush, in a television interview on Cable News Network, said he
will debate his opponent during the general election campaign.
   ``I think any candidate, any nominee of his party, should have
the right to negotiate for when the debates should be, who should
sponsor them, and all of that, but I will have debates and I look
forward to it,'' he said.
   Bush is going to have to win over suspicious conservatives while
working to attract such traditionally Democratic and independent
voters as blue-collar workers and ethnics who voted for Reagan,
some analysts said.
   ``I think he has a problem,'' said GOP consultant John
Deardourff. ``In a certain sense he is not the master of his own
destiny. A captive candidate. He cannot run away from any aspect of
the Reagan-Bush record. He may be very uncomfortable bearing that
burden.''
   ``He's not in a position to say, `I think the president was
wrong to keep offering (Attorney General) Ed Meese little shades of
comfort here and there,''' Deardourff said.
   ``Even if that weren't the case, he is about to be the nominee
of a bunch of delegates who are very conservative people. There's
little room for leeway there.''
   Fahrenkopf, however, said he does not worry about Bush's
flexibility being limited by a party platform drafted at least in
part by hard-core conservatives.
   ``I don't look for any battles on the platform,'' he said,
noting that Bush supported the 1980 platform. ``I think there will
be strong support among conservatives for the vice president.''
   Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan political adviser, said that
Bush succeeded in winning the nomination by using an ``error-free,
risk-free strategy, which I think was a very wise approach for a
vice president.''
   But Daniels also said he felt that tactic would be ``a very
hazardous approach in the fall election campaign.''
   Bush, in brief network television interviews Wednesday,
acknowledged that he wants to improve his appeal to blacks, other
minorities and ethnic groups.
   He noted that the Democratic Party has won most blacks' votes
for decades, but he said that could change if Jesse Jackson's
supporters don't like the way he is treated as the campaign plays
out.
   ``If he's not treated fairly, a lot of people are going to be
open-minded and if I campaign properly with the way I feel in my
heart about openness and inclusion, we might surprise people
there,'' he said.
   Republican consultant Eddie Mahe Jr. said he thought talk of
Bush's need to broaden his appeal to groups outside the party has
been exaggerated.
   ``To the extent that broadening the base means moving to the
left, I don't think he has to do that,'' Mahe said. ``I think
George Bush's bigger problem is to persuade (critics) that his
sense of the world and the globe is very much the same as Ronald
Reagan's.''

<HEAD>U.S.-Escorted Convoy Sails After Mine Delay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A convoy of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers
sailed up the Persian Gulf Wednesday after a one-day delay prompted
by mine-hunting operations and poor weather, a U.S. Central Command
spokesman said.
   Tanker convoys fell behind schedule after the U.S. frigate
Samuel B. Roberts hit a mine on April 14, injuring 10 seamen, and
after about a dozen more mines subsequently were found in central
gulf shipping lanes.
   Three Kuwaiti tankers and a fourth U.S.-flagged ship were
sighted proceeding north Wednesday off the United Arab Emirates
after moving through the Strait of Hormuz during the night. Four
U.S. warships escorted them.
   In Brussels, where a meeting of NATO defense ministers was being
held, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy agreed on
Wednesday to step up cooperation among their mine-sweeping forces
in the gulf.
   Last week, Belgian and other mine sweepers found newly laid
mines in the waterway following U.S. retaliatory strikes on Iranian
oil facilities. The strikes were carried out after the Roberts was
mined.
   U.S. officials welcomed the European decision to work together
more closely.
   Officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said the
United States meanwhile was still considering extending its
protection in the gulf to ships not flying the Stars and Stripes.
   British Defense Secretary George Younger said America ``is
talking about the possibility of protecting other flags ... They'd
restrict themselves to protecting friendly shipping'' from attacks
by Iran.
   Iran and Iraq went to war in September 1980 and fighting between
the Persian Gulf neighbors later extended to the gulf waters.
   No reports emerged of activity by Iran's navy or missile
batteries during the latest convoy's passage through the narrow
southern entry to the gulf.
   Iran said Wednesday that 15 U.S. Marines were wounded in April
18 skirmishes between U.S. and Iranian forces and were flown to
West Germany for treatment.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Manama,
said the wounded men were earlier hospitalized in Bahrain, adding
that ``the U.S. has not yet disclosed its casualty figures'' in the
fighting.
   A U.S. Central Command spokesman was unavailable to comment on
the Iranian report. The Pentagon said earlier no American
casualties occurred in daylong skirmishes that began with an attack
by U.S. warships on Iranian oil platforms.
   The Kuwaiti daily al-Seyassah quoted a Soviet military
commander, Gen. Yuri Markivov, as saying in an interview Wednesday
that the presence of foreign fleets in the gulf ``implies a
dangerous possibiliity of turning the war into a wider regional
conflict.''
   Marikov was quoted as saying the Soviet Union does not intend to
use its weapons in the gulf ``because this would lead to the
outbreak of a third world war.''
   He said the Soviet Union has three warships in the gulf for
escorting Soviet commercial ships, the Kuwaiti paper reported.
   Gulf-based shipping executives, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said the latest U.S. convoy included the destroyers
O'Brien and Merrill, the guided missile destroyer Joseph Strauss
and the guided missile cruiser Wainwright.
   The tankers in the convoy included the 46,723-ton Gas Queen, a
liquefied gas carrier; the oil products tankers Chesapeake City and
Ocean City, each 79,999 tons; and the Golden Monarch, a 92,854-ton
tanker.
   An unidentified tanker flying the British flag was sailing
alongside the single-file convoy.
   The convoy had turned back after originally starting out on
Tuesday because of a sandstorm that would have hindered helicopters
and patrol craft in their efforts to scout for mines ahead of the
ships.
   The Kuwaiti tankers were reflagged by the United States last
year for protection from Iranian attack.

   Palestinian guerrillas crossed Israel's heavily
guarded border from Lebanon for the second day in a row Wednesday
and wounded a truck driver before soldiers caught them in a ravine
and killed them, the army said.
   No Israeli army casualties were reported.
   Israeli officials said the increase in cross-border raids
appeared connected with nearly five months of violence in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Documents found on the two dead guerrillas showed they planned
to take hostages and try to exchange them for Arab prisoners held
in Israeli jails, using U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering as a
negotiator, a military source said.
   Settlements in northern Israel were put on alert during a
three-hour search for the guerrillas by foot patrols and
helicopters. Roads were closed and men were told to stand guard
with guns. Women and children were ordered to stay indoors.
   On Tuesday, three guerrillas crossed the border at the same
spot. They and two soldiers were killed when an army patrol found
them.
   A 14-year-old Palestinian girl died Wednesday of wounds suffered
the day before when Israeli soldiers opened fire during an Arab
protest in the occupied West Bank, the army and hospital officials
said.
   Her death brought to at least 174 the number of Palestinians
killed since a rebellion began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel has occupied since the 1967
war. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish settler also have been killed.
   The guerrillas crossed the border unnoticed, and it was the
truck driver who alerted troops after running away from the
assailants, said the military source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   While officials say violence in the territories has declined,
Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled said on Israel radio: ``There is an increased
effort on the part of Palestinians to reach northern settlements .
.. and this is certainly a change.'' He is chief of Israel's
northern command, in charge of the border area.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin appeared to blame Syria, saying
that ``the last three attacks (from Lebanon) were carried out out
by pro-Syrian PLO groups.''
   A joint statement issued in Beirut claimed responsibility for
Tuesday's raid on behalf of Lebanon Communist Party led by George
Hawi and George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a pro-Syrian faction of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   But the military source said the guerrillas were members of the
pro-Syrian Palestine Liberation Front, headed by Mohammed Abbas,
who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise
ship in which an American was killed.
   Also on Wednesday, an army inquiry said the teen-age Jewish
settler who died April 6 in a clash with Palestinians in the West
Bank town of Beita was killed by a bullet fired by an Israeli
guarding her hiking party.
   It blamed Beita residents for provoking the incident, in which
two Palestinians also were killed and the guard was seriously
wounded.
   According to the army report on the incursion, two guerrillas
armed with hand grenades and light weapons crossed the border at
midday Wednesday within yards of the spot where the three
Palestinians infiltrated a day earlier.
   They attacked truck driver Dan Dahan, 24, near ``Tank Junction''
where a rusting ruin of a Soviet tank used by the Syrians in the
1967 Middle East war stands as a memorial.
   ``Suddenly they fired at me ... and threw a grenade,'' Dahan
said on Israel radio. ``I jumped from the truck and it started to
roll down and I hid behind it. They fired at me while I crawled on
the ground ... and I ran into the bushes.''
   Dahan was shot in the hand and wounded in the back by grenade
shrapnel.
   Zvi Yuval, a 37-year-old civilian from Kibbutz Senir about three
miles south of the border, was among those who stood guard. He told
The Associated Press he heard constant gunfire during the search,
including shots fired from helicopters.
   ``We fear there will be more attacks this summer,'' he said.
``That's when the vegetation is like a jungle,'' providing cover
for guerrillas.
   Border crossings often cause an uproar in security-conscious
Israel. After Tuesday's penetration, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
sought to reassure Israelis by declaring on Israel radio: ``We are
paying a high price ... but the border is impenetrable for
terrorists. So it is and so it will be.''
   The pro-Syrian Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack.

<HEAD>Group of US Attorneys Wants Ulrich To Be Deputy Attorney General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A number of U.S. attorneys concerned over
Attorney General Edwin Meese III's inability to fill the Justice
Department's No. 2 post want one of their colleagues installed in
the vacant position, three department sources said Wednesday.
   A Justice Department advisory committee of U.S. attorneys held a
lengthy discussion about the vacancy Tuesday and concluded in an
informal vote that Meese should chose Robert Ulrich, the U.S.
attorney in Kansas City, to fill the post of deputy attorney
general, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Ulrich is chairman of the advisory committee, but was not in the
room when the consensus was reached, said the sources.
   Justice Department spokesman Terry Eastland said he spoke to
several U.S. attorneys on the advisory committee and could find no
evidence of any written or verbal petition that was delivered to
the Meese on the matter.
   The sources said the U.S. attorneys had not presented their
views to Meese, who was in California on Wednesday, and that it was
unclear whether they would do so.
   The deputy attorney general post became vacant last Friday with
the departure of Arnold Burns, who submitted his resignation March
29 in a protest against Meese's continued tenure. Burns reportedly
felt Meese's refusal to resign in the face of a nearly yearlong
criminal investigation was damaging Justice Department operations.
   ``The sense at the meeting was that the U.S. attorneys wanted
Ulrich and wanted him as deputy because that's where their bread is
buttered,'' said one of the sources. ``They want someone who knows
and understands U.S. attorneys and who can hit the ground running.''
   Meese has made two unsuccessful attempts to fill the job. Former
federal appeals court judge Arlin Adams rejected Meese's overtures
to take the post, saying he had a heavy caseload to handle at his
Philadelphia law firm. Meese then asked St. Louis attorney John
Shepherd, a former American Bar Association president, to take the
job. Shepherd withdrew from consideration due to publicity over
allegations by a former bookkeeper at his law firm that the two had
an affair. Shepherd denied the allegations, but said the ensuing
strain on his family had become intolerable.
   The office of deputy attorney general is vital to the effective
functioning of the 93 U.S. attorneys' offices and the deputy is the
man to whom the U.S. attorneys most frequently report.
   The deputy makes key budget decisions that affect the U.S.
attorneys' offices and settles disputes between their offices.
   The advisory committee is an administrative mechanism by which
the attorney general keeps in touch with activities in the various
U.S. attorneys' offices around the country.
   Meanwhile, Meese also has been unable to fill the post of
assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division,
vacated by the protest resignation of William Weld, who quit the
same day as Burns.
   Weld is joining the Washington office of a Boston law firm along
with two former Justice Department aides who quit with him.
   Weld, Jane Serene and Mark Robinson will join the Washington
office of Hale and Dorr, a 250-member Boston law firm.

   Revolutionary Guards in Iran smashed a
drug smuggling ring there and seized 1,065 pounds of heroin and
opium, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Wednesday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the ring operated in
northeastern Khorasan province and brought drugs in from
neighboring Afghanistan for distribution inside Iran.
   IRNA did not say how many ring members were arrested.
   It said the haul included 220 pounds of heroin, 845 pounds of
opium, more than $75,000 in cash and three trucks and six cars
belonging to the smugglers.
   Earlier this month, IRNA reported that Iranian security forces
had seized a total of 20,900 pounds of drugs in Khorasan's
neighboring province of Kerman during the Iranian year ending on
March 21. It said 43 smugglers were killed in clashes with security
forces and 179 were arrested in the same period.
   The Islamic fundamentalist government of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has cracked down on use of narcotics and made
drug-trafficking a capital offense.

<TEXT>
   John Wesley, an Anglican priest, began Methodism in England in
1738 as a movement within the existing Church of England. His
intention was to organize societies in the church, not to found a
new sect.
   The term ``Methodists'' arose from names flung at Wesley and
early followers because of their methodical rules of conduct and
observance.
   After the American Revolution, Wesley ordained two men to
preside over the newly independent American Methodists and adopted
25 of the Anglican church's 39 Articles. The first U.S.
denomination, the Methodist Episcopal Church in America, was
organized in Baltimore in 1784.

<HEAD>Paper Says Khrushchev Opened Path for Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet newspaper on Wednesday credited Nikita S.
Khrushchev with planting the seeds for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms 20 years later, but said the late, former premier caused
his own downfall with his inconsistency.
   The two-page article in Moscow News was one of the most detailed
evaluations to appear in the Soviet press of the man who launched
the ``deStalinization'' drive by denouncing the dictator's ``cult
of personality'' in 1956.
   It comes as Soviet scholars and writers are trying to come to
grips with the legacy of Josef Stalin. During Stalin's almost three
decades of rule, millions of Soviets died as a result of purges and
crash programs of industrialization and collectivization of
agriculture.
   Khrushchev consolidated his power after Stalin died in 1953, but
was forced out by other Communist Party leaders in 1964.
   ``Not one of his steps was made firmly enough, not one of his
beginnings was carried out to the end,'' philosopher Yuri Levada
and economist Viktor Sheinis wrote.
   ``All the same, the main result of the stormy and contradictory
decade, without a doubt, was that a return to Stalinism, at least
in its earlier `classical' forms, was impossible, unthinkable.''
   The writers said Krushchev set the stage for ``new social and
political thinking.''
   ``A new generation came into the life of society, not knowing
total fear, able to learn to understand its society and restructure
it. After two decades these seeds bore fruit,'' they said.
   The writers said one major lesson of the Khrushchev period was
that the policies of any leader are insecure if they depend mainly
on the division of power at the highest official levels.
   It said democracy, the rule of law and openness must predominate.
   Khrushchev became a non-entity in the official press during the
leadership of President Leonid I. Brezhnev, who succeeded him.
   But Gorbachev criticized Brezhnev for allowing stagnation and
corruption to overcome Soviet society, and gave Khrushchev a
measure of praise in a speech last November marking the 70th
anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution.
   Wednesday's article was accompanied by three photos of
Khrushchev, including one with party theoretician Mikhail Suslov
and geneticist Trofim Lysenko.
   Lysenko dominated much of Soviet agriculture in Stalin's last
years, and now is accused of having held back the study of genetics
with baseless scientific theories. Suslov was a powerful member of
Brezhnev's Politburo before his death in 1982.
   Moscow News said many of Khrushchev's foreign policy moves were
not well thought out, but credited him and President John F.
Kennedy with wise leadership during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
   It said Khrushchev's boast to capitalist countries, ``We will
bury you,'' fed Western fears of Soviet aggressiveness.

   A spring storm Wednesday brought cold, blustery weather to the
Great Lakes region and dumped record snow for April in Minnesota,
while a hail punctuated a warm day in southern Florida.
   Snow across Wisconsin and northern Illinois on Wednesday morning
changed to rain as the storm moved east. By afternoon, snow fell in
northern Lower Michigan.
   Winds of 25 to 40 mph were clocked from Wisconsin into eastern
Iowa and Missouri, Indiana and Michigan. Combined with temperatures
often below 40, the gusty winds produced wind chill readings in the
upper teens to upper 20s.
   Rochester, Minn., received 13.7 inches of snow from Tuesday
evening through early Wednesday, a record for snowfall in April
from a single storm. The previous record was 12.5 inches in 1945.
   The most snow reported in Wisconsin was 4 to 5 inches in the
Stratford area, just west of Wausau. Eau Claire reported 1 inch,
while Marshfield had 3, Stevens Point, 2, and Antigo, 3.
   Showers and widely scattered thunderstorms occurred ahead of a
cold front from south central and southeast New York state across
central and eastern Pennsylvania and into central Virginia.
   Thunderstorms were also scattered across the southern third of
Florida and the Florida Keys. Nickel-size hail pelted Plantation,
Fla.
   Skies were cloudy across the Pacific Northwest with a few
showers along the coast of Washington and Oregon.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly a quarter inch at Houghton Lake, Mich., and more
than a tenth of an inch at Milwaukee.
   The low temperature at Kansas City International Airport dipped
to 32 degrees Wednesday morning, breaking the record low for the
date of 38 in 1978.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT Wednesday ranged
from 34 degrees at Alpena, Mich., to 91 degrees at Homestead, Fla.,
and Miami. The nation's low Wednesday morning was 10 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Thursday's forecast called for widespread rain showers from the
lower Great Lake and upper Ohio Valley through the middle Atlantic
states and New England, and rain across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Plateau. Scattered rain showers were predicted from north
central Arizona into southwest Utah.
   High temperatures should be in the 60s or 70s across much of the
nation, except 40s in the eastern Great Lakes region and upper Ohio
Valley, 50s from the western Great Lakes through the lower Ohio
Valley and middle Atlantic region into New England and 80s across
much of the southernmost states.

   President Reagan reaffirmed his belief in
Attorney General Edwin Meese III's honesty on Wednesday, asserting
that only ``a complete change of character'' would force him to ask
his long-time friend to resign.
   Reagan reacted heatedly when reporters queried him about a Wall
Street Journal report Wednesday that said some of his friends and
advisers had mounted an effort to oust the attorney general, and
that Nancy Reagan supported it.
   ``I shouldn't answer the question. But I have to tell you, no,
I'm not aware'' of such a move, Reagan responded.
   ``I thought the story was totally inaccurate,'' he added.
   Asked what circumstances might prompt him to get rid of Meese,
the president shot back, ``Well, if he had a complete change of
character.''
   Meese, attending a funeral in Pasadena, Calif., on Wednesday,
said:
   ``Today I've had a number of phone calls to me directly and to
my office by a number of people mentioned in the article. They all
said that it's untrue; the substance of the article as it pertains
to them was untrue.''
   He added that he had not spoken with Mrs. Reagan about the
article, but said the president's comments showed that he still
supported him.
   Vice President George Bush, the apparent Republican nominee for
president, said in a television interview on Cable News Network,
``Ed Meese will obviously make his determination at his time, and
in the rest of the time the system is moving forward ... and that's
the way it ought to be.''
   ``I can't tell you it would help or hurt'' the Bush presidential
campaign, the vice president said, ``but ... he (Meese) is entitled
to a very objective determination as to whether he may have done
something wrong.''
   ``I will not get into this particular case,'' Bush said. ``I
don't think it's my role as a vice president to try to out there
and suggest that Mr. Meese ought to get out or stay.``
   In spite of Meese's legal problems, Reagan has consistently
defended his attorney general's ethics and his performance at the
Justice Department.
   However, the department has been beset by the resignations of
several top-level Meese associates and officials have been
scrambling to fill a vacuum in the key posts.
   Two of those who resigned, Arnold I. Burns and William Weld, had
a face-to-face meeting last week with Reagan in which they outlined
their reasons for leaving and said they felt Meese should resign in
the face of an array of investigations. Weld told Reagan that if it
were up to him, he would indict Meese, according to an
administration source speaking anonymously.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay has been examining Meese's
assistance to the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a proposed $1
billion oil pipeline project. Also under investigation are Meese's
meetings with regional Bell telephone company executives at a time
when he owned $14,000 in Baby Bell stock and the role of Meese's
longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach, in securing a $40,000-a-year
job for the attorney general's wife, Ursula Meese.
   Last Friday, Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., asked the General
Services Administration to provide him with a ``full report'' on
the signing in May 1987 of a $50 million lease on an office
building for Justice Department workers.
   A partnership headed by Howard M. Bender owned the building,
which was sold for a $22.6 million profit 13 days after the lease
was signed The Bender family foundation pays Mrs. Meese's $40,000
salary at the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
   Despite Meese's legal problems, Reagan consistently has stood by
the man who has served him since his days as governor of California.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said Meese was
returning to Washington on Wednesday night to resume a full work
schedule Thursday.
   ``The attorney general not only has a full schedule for the rest
of the week, but for the next couple of months. He is preparing for
events in July and August. There is no question in my mind that he
intends to fulfill his obligations as attorney general for the
forseeable future.''
   Korten said the Wall Street Journal's sources were engaging in
``fiction or perhaps wishful thinking'' and that the story ``does
not come close to reflecting reality.''
   The Journal story quoted a White House official it did not name
as saying the dump-Meese effort has ``gone underground'' despite
Reagan's repeated orders to halt any action against the attorney
general.
   The report identified longtime Reagan campaign consultant Stuart
Spencer as being one of the associates convinced that ethical
questions plaguing Meese had become a threat to the Republican
Party as well as damaging the Justice Department.
   The paper also said White House officials sounded out former
Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger as a possible successor to
Meese, but Weinberger rejected the proposal.
   Weinberger was asked about the report Wednesday in Orlando,
Fla., where he was speaking to the American Automobile Association.
   ``I think we have a good attorney general,'' the former Cabinet
officer said, adding that he had no desire to return to government
service.
   He later told Cable News Network the Journal story was ``all
wrong.''
   ``These things are not so,'' Weinberger said. ``I did not have
any suggestion that Mr. Meese should leave, and under no
circumstances whatever would I even take the office, if it should
be offered. It's never been offered.''
   Asked to comment on Mrs. Reagan's reported role in the Meese
ouster campaign, Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary,
said: ``She hasn't been making any telephone calls, she hasn't been
getting any telephone calls, she's not involved in it.''
   Mrs. Reagan also ``knows that Meese has to go,'' the newspaper
said, quoting a person familiar with the first lady's views. Mrs.
Reagan was widely reported to have been unhappy with the
performance of former chief of staff Donald T. Regan, a development
that helped tip the scale against him.
   Asked about this, Mrs. Crispen replied, ``It's very difficult
for me to respond to these ghost quotes _ I don't know if this
person has talked to the first lady in the past year. I do know
that she hasn't been involved in any campaign'' to oust the
attorney general.
   Meese's future drew a variety of comments from a group of
senators who visited briefly with Reagan during a private bill
signing ceremony.
   ``Certainly, you have to be concerned about how effective he can
be in his job, but I want to underscore that there's been a lot of
accusations made, and so far, no proof. I think ... we need to be
very careful that we don't find people guilty before they are
charged or tried,'' said Sen. James A. McClure, R-Idaho.
   ``It's a judgment question for the president and for him,
whether all the conversation about it and all the reports that
swirl around him have impaired his ability to function,'' McClure
added.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., a former transportation secretary
under President Carter, said Meese should step down.
   ``I think resignations at times are necessary. ... I think he
should resign for the benefit of making the Department of Justice
move well and swiftly.''

   Contra military commanders Wednesday issued for the
first time a statement supporting the peace talks in Nicaragua, an
apparent reaction to reports of sharp divisions in the rebel
movement.
   Contra military chief Enrique Bermudez and six general staff
members signed the statement, in which they pledged their troops
would maintain the ``suspension of military operations'' in
Nicaragua.
   The statement represents the first time the military has issued
any written declaration of support for either for the peace talks
or the directors.
   It follows a week of widespread reports that the Contra leaders
had split over the peace talks and that Contra director Adolfo
Calero had headed an unsuccessful effort to fire Bermudez.
   The declaration was issued on the eve of the latest meeting
between Contra directors and Sandinista leaders, due to begin
Thursday in Managua.
   The five Contra directors were to leave Miami on Wednesday for
San Jose, Costa Rica, where they would spend the night before
flying to the talks, according to Jorge Rosales, a spokesman for
the rebels.
   Calero in an interview Monday denied any attempt to fire
Bermudez but conceded that there were differences among the leaders
and that two commanders had expressed disagreement with the talks.
   He also acknowledged a shakeup in the military staff, saying
three civilian staff members had been fired and replaced by
officers.
   Wednesday's statement by the military seemed designed to allow
the Contras to go into Thursday's talks showing a united front.
   The military ``reiterates its support to the Directorate of the
Nicaraguan Resistance in the process of negotiations initiated''
with an accord reached March 23 in Sapoa, Nicaragua, said the
declaration issued by the Contras' Miami headquarters.
   The statement said five military leaders, including four members
of Bermudez's general staff, would attend the Managua talks with
the directors.
   The commanders promised to ``maintain a suspension of offensive
military operations in all of the national territory.''
   But they emphasized that the Central American peace plan which
led to the Sapoa agreement ``has democratization as an essential
condition for reaching peace and national reconciliation.''
   The Contras have insisted that they will not lay down their arms
until the Sandinista government takes concrete steps toward
democracy in the country.

   Two former Cabinet ministers were
arrested Wednesday in the case of a businessman and his son who
claim to be victims of illegal arrest and extortion during the
1976-83 military regime.
   Federal Judge Martin Irurzun reported the arrests of Jose
Martinez de Hoz and Gen. Albano Harguindeguy, who served as economy
minister and interior minister respectively in the military
government. He said an arrest order also was issued for a president
of the junta, former Gen. Jorge Videla.
   Videla already is in prison, sentenced to life in 1985 after
conviction on charges arising from human rights abuses and the
disappearances and presumed deaths of at least 9,000 people.
   Federico Gutheim says he and his son Miguel were detained by
order of the military government on Nov. 5, 1976. The arrest order
was signed by Martinez de Hoz, Harguindeguy and Videla, Gutheim
said.
   Harguindeguy, as interior minister, was in charge of police.
   Gutheim said he and his son were accused of activities ``against
the internal peace, tranquillity and public order and the permanent
interests of the Argentine republic.''
   Another decree of the military government freed them without
explanation on April 6, 1977, he said.
   The businessman told the judge that during their incarceration
without charge, government officials pressed him and his son to end
a large cotton-export trade with Hong Kong. He said his cotton
operations ultimately were taken over by a competitor.
   Martinez de Hoz, 63, was the main civilian figure in the
military government. He introduced several comparatively liberal
economic programs that provoked protest from business interests,
consumers and labor unions.
   He was economy minister in 1976-1981. Critics said his programs
overvalued Argentina's currency against the dollar, adversely
affected exports and greatly increased the foreign debt.
   Argentina's foreign debt was $8 billion in 1976 and grew to $46
billion by the time civilian rule returned with the election of
President Raul Alfonsin in 1983.
   In 1986, Martinez de Hoz was detained for 48 hours by order of a
House of Deputies committee investigating the government's purchase
of an electric company he once headed. The legislators concluded
the purchase price was far above fair market value.
   The former minister says he is innocent. The case is pending.

Manitoba</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The voters of this prairie province
threw out Canada's only socialist government and the Conservatives
laid plans Wednesday to form a minority administration.
   Provincial elections Tuesday gave the Progressive Conservatives
25 of the legislature's 57 seats, the Liberal Party 20 seats and
the incumbent socialist New Democratic Party 12.
   The New Democrats controlled Manitoba for 15 of the past 19
years. Polls had forecast their defeat, however, because of charges
they mishandled the government-run auto insurance plan and other
corporations owned by the province.
   Premier Howard Pawley had to call the election after losing a
vote of confidence last month and chose not to seek re-election in
his own district. His successor, Gary Doer, could not revive the
party's fortunes. It won 23 percent of the vote compared with 41
percent in 1986.
   The election marked the rebirth in Manitoba of the Liberal
Party, which had only one seat in the last legislature.
   Its leader, Winnipeg schoolteacher Sharon Carstairs, became the
only woman leader of an official opposition party in Canada and
could be the first woman premier if the Conservatives cannot govern
the province without a majority.
   If Progressive Conserverative leader Gary Filmon's government
fails to win the support of either Liberals or New Democrats on
crucial votes, he could be forced into another election.
   Filmon ruled out policy trade-offs to win such backing. ``I'm
not talking about any deals,'' he said Wednesday.
   Ms. Carstairs said ``I don't believe in coalitions'' and
expressed no interest in forming one with the New Democrats in
which she might be premier.
   Five of Canada's 10 provincial governments now are led by the
Conservatives and four by the Liberals. British Columbia is
governed by the Social Credit Party.

<TEXT>
   Federal marshals seized apartments in two city
housing projects Wednesday in a campaign to hit suspected drug
dealers where they live _literally.
   Emanuel Popolizio, chairman of the city Housing Authority, said
the move, carried out with help from the police, ``sends out the
word to drug abusers: get the hell out of our housing projects and
get the hell out of the city of New York!''
   Federal marshals seized the two apartments in Manhattan and the
Bronx, changed the locks and evicted two tenants, who were then
booked on drug trafficking charges.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said he believes it was the first
time in the nation that civil provisions of federal drug laws have
been used to seize the lease of a public housing apartment. ``It
will not be the last,'' he said.
   Giuliani said the civil statute that allows seizure _ and
forfeiture upon conviction _ of property used in the commission of
drug offenses. The statute had been used previously to seize
private housing, cars, boats and planes.
   Officials said the seizures were prompted by tenants' complaints
about trafficking.
   One apartment was taken over on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and
its lone tenant, Sandra Deanne, 28, was charged with heroin
trafficking. In the South Bronx, Donald Johnson, 49, was charged
with cocaine trafficking and his apartment seized.
   According to court papers, both have previous narcotics arrests.
Each faces a maximum 60-year prison sentence if convicted on all
the charges.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said police will submit other
known drug locations for possible seizure by federal authorities.
   He said police had targeted 10 locations in Queens near the home
of a man relocated by the federal Witness Protection Program after
drug dealers firebombed his house and assassinated a police officer
guarding his home.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who also announced the seizures, quipped
that with the government taking over the leases in city-owned
apartments Giuliani ``becomes one of my tenants. ... I'm sure I'll
hear from him about heat and hot water.''

   Authorities confiscated more grapefruit Wednesday
and scientists studied poison found injected in fruit taken from a
Rome supermarket.
   No illnesses or deaths were reported. Doctors had suspected a
58-year-old woman hospitalized in Florence drank contaminated
grapefruit juice but they later attributed her illness to a virus.
   Authorities confiscated a blue-colored grapefruit in Modena,
near Bologna, and sent it to a laboratory to be tested, the news
agency ANSA said Wednesday.
   Six grapefruit injected with a blue poison were found at a Rome
supermarket Tuesday after a newspaper received a warning telephone
call. The Health Ministry ordered seizure of all grapefruit on sale
in Italy.
   Laboratory mice which ate tainted grapefruit taken from the
supermarket died immediately. The ministry said hoped to identify
the poison by Thursday.
   An organization which said it supported the Palestinian
rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories had called for a
boycott of Israeli products and claimed last week to have poisoned
Israeli grapefruit on sale in Milan. Laboratory tests showed no
contamination.
   The anonymous caller to the Rome newspaper Tuesday claimed
responsibility for a group calling itself the Organization of
Metropolitan Proletarians and Oppressed People. A poster calling
for a boycott of Israeli products was pasted to a wall of the
supermarket where the poisoned fruit was found.
   ANSA said Italy imports about 23,000 tons of grapefruit a year
from Israel.
   Israel sent experts to Italy to help determine if the poisoned
fruit came from there. Italian news agencies said Wednesday that
tests found no poison in samples taken from the company that
distributes Israeli grapefruit.
   In Brussels, the European Commission alerted the 12 Common
Market countries to the danger and asked them to begin
investigations, a spokesman said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Separatists Seize Eight New Hostages, Including Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Melanesian separatists seized an
assistant prosecutor and seven police officers who went to their
cave hideaway on Wednesday to negotiate the release of 15 kidnapped
policeman, officials said.
   Earlier Wednesday, the separatists released one policeman who
felt ill, officials said.
   Assistant Prosecutor Jean Bianconi was seied at about 9 a.m. on
the island of Ouvea, part of the Loyalty Islands 110 miles north of
Noumea, the capital on the main island of this French Southwest
Pacific territory.
   Also captured were Capt. Philippe Legorjus, head of the elite
gendarmes special intervention force, five of his men and a
Melanesian policeman.
   Last Friday, separatists attacked the police station in the
Ouvea village of Fayaoue, killing four officers and capturing 27.
Twelve of those hostages have been released. Besides the one
released Wednesday, 11 were freed Monday.
   The captives, who now number 23, were being held Wednesday in a
cave on the north side of Ouvea.
   The kidnappers demanded that officials annul local elections
that took place Sunday, send an envoy from Paris to discuss
autonomy, and withdraw police reinforcements from Ouvea.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up about 43 percent of
New Caledonia's 145,000 inhabitants. An estimated 80 percent of
them favor independence. The rest of the population is made up of
European settlers, Polynesians and Asians, most of whom want to
remain French.
   Bernard Pons, French minister for overseas territories who went
to New Caledonia to direct operations, said the cave was
inaccessible because it was in a cliff near the sea with heavy
vegetation around it.
   Pons said authorities located the cave Tuesday. He said
Bianconi, who claimed to have good relations with the separatists,
proposed himself as an intermediary and went to the hideout with a
police escort.
   Pons said that after Bianconi established verbal contact with
the kidnappers, he moved toward the cave with the gendarmes and all
were surrounded and taken captive.
   In an interview published Wednesday in the Paris newspaper
France-Soir, Pons said the government was considering officially
dissolving the main separatist group, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front (FLNKS), and making membership in it illegal.
   ``Until now, there has been no reason for taking such a step,''
Pons said. ``The FLNKS could be considered a component of the
political life of the territory, but current events lead me to
re-examine the question.''
   Leopold Joredie, secretary-general of the Union Caledonienne,
the main component of the Front, told The Associated Press by
telephone, ``The only way to suppress the (independence) demands of
the Kanaks is to eliminate us all.''
   In Paris the Constitutional Council, France's highest legal
body, ruled that Sunday's first-round presidential election results
from three of the 139 polling stations in New Caledonia were
invalid.
   President Francois Mitterrand had asked that all presidential
election results from New Caledonia be annulled because the
situation there forced some polling stations to close.
   The council ruled, however, that ``overall'' the crisis did not
affect the voting process.

<TEXT>
   White House communications director Tom
Griscom ordered a Secret Service officer to expel New York Times
reporter Steven Roberts from his office Wednesday after an apparent
heated exchange concerning news coverage of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III.
   Neither participant would personally discuss the incident, and a
telephone call to Griscom was not immediately returned.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he knew of no other
occasion when a reporter was escorted against his or her will from
the private offices in the West Wing of the White House.
   The West Wing, where the president's Oval Office is located, is
mostly off-limits to reporters, and they may visit there only when
escorted by White House personnel.
   The Times' Washington bureau chief, Craig Whitney, confirmed the
incident.
   ``Mr. Griscom called me saying he'd taken offense at something
Steve had said regarding his truthfulness,'' Whitney said.
   Whitney said he did not know whether Griscom asked Roberts to
leave before calling for the Secret Service officer. ``All he
(Griscom) told me was he had had him (Roberts) escorted out of his
office,'' Whitney said.
   However, a senior White House official who spoke about the
incident but asked not to be quoted, said Griscom had asked Roberts
to leave and when he did not do so, called the Secret Service
officer to escort him out.
   Whitney said the two men had been discussing coverage of Meese,
who is the subject of several investigations.
   ``No physical violence'' was involved and Roberts left the
office with the escort, Whitney said.
   Whitney noted that Roberts and Griscom have long had a working
relationship from the time both worked on Capitol Hill, ``and I
told Griscom that he and Steve ... had to work this out between
themselves.''
   Asked what prompted the incident, Fitzwater said he could not
comment on what went on inside Griscom's office.
   But he did say: ``Roberts was angry about something and went out
in the hallway and was shouting obscenities outside the office. But
that was before he went to see Tommy, so what happened after that I
don't know.''
   Griscom is a longtime aide to White House chief of staff Howard
Baker, serving as his spokesman when Baker was the Republican
leader of the Senate.

<TEXT>
   A man who reported his wife missing five
months ago was charged with murder Wednesday after her body was
found encased in concrete at the newspaper building where they
worked.
   Theodore Sinks, a 49-year-old maintenance supervisor at Dayton
Newspapers Inc., was jailed under $100,000 bail in the slaying of
Judy Sinks.
   Montgomery County Coroner James Davis said that Mrs. Sinks, 44,
was strangled Nov. 19 and that she apparently also was beaten in
the head. Her husband had reported her wife missing Nov. 24, police
said.
   City workers found her body Tuesday after using pick axes and
sledge hammers to break up a concrete pedestal 2 feet high by 3 to
4 feet wide. It had been poured on the seventh floor of the Dayton
Newspapers Inc. building in November to support a water purifying
unit for an air conditioner.
   ``I believed from the first day the girl disappeared that she
was dead,'' said Mrs. Sinks' father, George Harmon, 70, of
Falmouth, Ind. ``I'm glad it's over. I kind of figured it would end
this way.''
   Douglas Franklin, Dayton Newspapers business manager, said
police had a tip that a body might be hidden on the seventh floor
of the building. Dayton Newspapers publishes the Dayton News and
Dayton Journal Herald.
   Police said an informant reported another newspaper employee,
Kenneth Rice, who worked under Sinks, had helped Sinks take a
55-gallon drum to the seventh-floor utility room Nov. 20, according
to Franklin.
   Rice said Sinks asked him to help dispose of what Sinks said was
a barrel of asbestos. Rice said they drove in a company truck to
pick up the barrel from Sinks' garage.
   Sinks was a supervisor in the plumbing, heating and
air-conditioning shop. Mrs. Sinks worked in the newspaper's
circulation department. They had been married about two years,
members of her family said.

   The National Rifle Association's chief
lobbyist gave a qualified endorsement Wednesday to compromise
legislation setting a minimum metallic standard for so-called
plastic guns.
   The Justice Department and law enforcement groups worked out the
compromise and it is being introduced in the Senate by James A.
McClure, R-Idaho.
   ``Our opinion is it's not a bad bill,'' said the NRA's James J.
Baker, characterizing his support as a ``qualified endorsement.''
   Baker said the NRA's main concern had been to ensure that
legislation didn't ban currently possessed firearms or any firearms
currently being manufactured in the United States or imported here.
The NRA also wanted to ensure that government officials have no
discretion to set standards that would lead to any ban. The
compromise would achieve those goals, said Baker.
   The NRA's concerns with the compromise stem from the fact that
there are law enforcement provisions attached to the new McClure
bill unrelated to plastic guns which the NRA feels should be taken
out and handled in separate legislation.
   The new McClure legislation would require that guns contain
material that would be as detectable by metal detectors as 3.7
ounces of stainless steel. The gun could have less metal or a
different kind of metal as long as it would meet the same
detectability standard.
   Earlier, the NRA had insisted that there should be no
government-established metal standard.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had offered legislation with
a higher metallic standard than the compromise. The NRA said
Metzenbaum's bill would have banned millions of handguns.
   Metzenbaum called the compromise ``very workable,'' said it will
``keep undetectable weapons out of hands of terrorists.'' He added
that the compromise ``won't in any way infringe on legitimate
rights of gun owners.''
   McClure said the compromise assures the safety of travelers
without being a piece of gun control legislation.
   The NRA and Meese had supported McClure's earlier bill that
would ban manufacture of undetectable plastic guns, but not require
a specific amount of metal.
   At a news conference, a Justice Department official said Meese
is not withdrawing his support from the earlier McClure bill. ``But
we think this is a better bill,'' said Joseph Morris, director of
the office of liaison services. Justice Department spokesman
Patrick Korten denied that Meese had changed his position on the
issue.
   Police organizations and gun-control advocates have insisted
that a minimum amount of metal be required in a gun to ensure
detection by the magnetometers used in airport and building
security systems.
   The gun control and police groups have argued that not having a
metal standard would cause long delays in airports. They contended
that without a minimum metal requirement for the gun, magnetometers
must be used at settings so sensitive that they would constantly
trigger alarms.

   Five homemade bombs exploded on a
railroad track as a U.S. military train passed en route to West
Berlin, damaging the train and injuring a locomotive engineer, West
German police said Wednesday.
   The engineer's face was cut by flying glass, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Steve Stromvall, spokesman for the U.S. Army in West Berlin,
said the attack occurred late Tuesday in a remote area between the
West German cities of Kassel and Goettingen.
   About 30 people were aboard the three-car Berlin duty train at
the time, Stromvall said.
   The military's duty train travels between Frankfurt and West
Berlin each evening carrying soldiers and their relatives, mail and
supplies for the U.S. military based in the divided city.
   The train sustained about $73,000 in damage, police said. The
five bombs were placed near one another on the tracks, they said.
Authorities earlier reported that there was only one bomb.
   Stromvall said the train continued on to Goettingen after a
brief halt. In that city, a new locomotive was attached to the
train, which then left for West Berlin.
   U.S. Army officials and West German police are investigating the
incident.
   A similar attack on the Berlin duty train occurred on Aug. 31,
1987. No injuries were reported.

   A pregnant woman shot and killed a narcotics
officer through a closed door during a raid on a cocaine den
Wednesday, police said.
   The woman, Mercedes Perez, later gave birth at the hospital
where she was taken with gunshot wounds suffered in the shootout
that killed Sgt. John F. McCormick, 43, police said.
   The death was the third slaying this year of a city police
officer _ all in the battle against narcotics _ and prompted
renewed calls from the police commissioner and Mayor Edward I. Koch
for the death penalty for cop killers.
   ``She shot a cop. She knew she was shooting at a cop. And she
killed a cop. As far as I'm concerned, she should be taken out and
executed. I don't care whether it's a deterrent. ... Kill them all
and let God sort them out,'' said Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward.
   Ward said a half-dozen officers in police vests had broken down
the door of the woman's apartment in the city's Inwood section and
identified themselves. Ms. Perez ran into a back bedroom and fired
two or three shots through the door, striking the officer in the
jaw, Ward said.
   The commissioner said two other police officers returned fire as
she tried to flee. She was struck in the arm and stomach and
tackled by police officers who grabbed her .38-caliber revolver, he
said.
   The woman, eight months pregnant, was taken to
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, where she went into labor and
gave birth to a 5-pound-1-ounce girl, authorities said.
   She and her daughter were in stable condition at the hospital,
said spokeswoman Elizabeth Loeb.
   McCormick died at the hospital a half-hour after the shooting,
authorities said.
   Another woman in the apartment, Maritzer Batista, 33, was
arrested without incident, according to Ward.
   Police had gone to the apartment in search of 4{ pounds of
cocaine, according to the warrant. They found scales and a plastic
bag containing white powder; a pit bull terrier was tied up in the
kitchen, police said.
   The Inwood section has one of the highest crime rates in the
city and is a center of drug-dealing activity, including the sale
of crack.
   On April 13, a Housing Authority police officer was slain while
searching for a missing child in a Brooklyn housing project. It is
believed that he stumbled onto a drug dispute.
   On Feb. 26, a patrolman was shot to death as he sat in his
cruiser guarding the home of a witness in a narcotics case in
Queens.
   In all of last year, four police officers were killed in the
line of duty.

   Negotiations early Thursday failed to
bring a settlement to a strike by thousands of workers at one of
Poland's biggest steel mills, and strikers said management was
threatening police intervention.
   Strikers at the sprawling Lenin steel mill outside Krakow in
southern Poland issued a statement declaring: ``The economic policy
of authorities of the Polish People's Republic has led millions of
workers and their families to the limits of poverty. ... Our faith
in party reforms is exhausted.''
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa earlier urged nationwide
``pressure on the authorities'' to bring about reforms.
   The strike was the biggest industrial action in Poland since the
1981 crackdown on the now-outlawed Solidarity trade union movement,
and it posed the sharpest challenge yet to government economic
reform policies.
   Another strike was threatened Friday at the 18,000-worker
Stalowa Wola heavy machinery plant in southeast Poland, and the
government prepared to enter talks Thursday with transit workers'
representatives seeking higher pay.
   A midnight negotiating session with management officials at the
Lenin steel mill ended after just 15 minutes, according to a strike
committee member who was reached by telephone and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The director said they were running out of possibilities of
solving it politically, and later the ZOMO (riot police) would take
over,'' said the strike committee member.
   On Wednesday, the second day of the stoppage, workers rejected a
big pay raise offer.
   ``We want our wages to assure us and our families a dignified
life and a proper rest after work,'' said the steel workers'
statement, signed by 16 members of the workers' strike committee
and read over the telephone.
   A strike committee member, Maciej Mach, said management hinted
during talks earlier Wednesday evening that force could be used to
break the strike, but he said this only strengthened workers'
resolve.
   ``There is enormous pressure on us to stop,'' he said. ``Various
arguments are used, including psychological arguments, arguments of
fear that December 1981 may be repeated.''
   On Dec. 13, 1981, soldiers and police suppressed Solidarity and
arrested hundreds of union supporters.
   Mach said the strike committee decided not to ask Walesa to join
the talks, partly out of concern for him.
   ``Let him remain (in Gdansk) where he is safe,'' he said.
   Strikers called on the government to double the $15 compensation
paid for recent price increases to many groups, including
industrial workers, retirees, teachers and health workers.
   They demanded an immediate 50 percent raise in the average $105
paid monthly pay to the Lenin plant's 32,000 workers, and turned
down a management offer of $50 in phased-in raises this year.
   The strike committee ``firmly rejected'' the offer broadcast
over loudspeakers to the workers Wednesday in a bid to break the
strike, said Jacek Kuron, a Solidarity adviser in Warsaw.
   Organizers said 12,000 workers were on strike, with many staying
at the site after their shifts. Government spokesman Jerzy Urban
said the number was 2,000.
   An earlier round of talks that began at 6 p.m. broke off before
9 p.m. without results, said a strike committee member who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Wieslaw Mazurkiewicz, another member of the hastily established
strike committee, reported, ``The mood is great. We are all decided
to strike until our demands are fully met.''
   Outwardly, the plant appeared calm, with no banners and little
activity.
   Walesa lent his support to the strikers Wednesday in a statement
issued from his home in Gdansk.
   ``Our union appeals to all living social forces ... for the
undertaking of united actions to put pressure on the authorities,''
he said. ``Millions of people are waiting for restoration of the
rights of their trade union, Solidarity.''
   The strike began Tuesday with 700 workers at the plant and then
grew. On Monday, 2,800 transit workers in the western city of
Bydgoszcz staged an 11-hour strike and won hourly wage increases of
60 percent.
   Galloping inflation in Poland has created widespread pressure
for wage increases.
   Prices in Poland shot up 42 percent in the first three months of
1988 as a result of a government economic program to reduce
subsidies on many consumer items. Part of the increase was
compensated for automatically, and the remainder was dependent on
the profitability of enterprises.
   The state-run news agency PAP said Wednesday that raises given
without regard to an enterprise's ability to pay would undermine
the entire reform.
   Kuron said the strike poses a dilemma for the government.
   ``If they give up at the Lenin mill, then everyone will line
up'' for raises, he said. ``If they stay tough, there could be a
more violent confrontation.''
   Urban, in an interview, said city transit workers in Lodz, Torun
and Grudziadz requested raises after the Bydgoszcz settlement.
   The head of the officially sanctioned union at the Lenin steel
mill, Stanislaw Sitkowski, said many of his members were taking
part in the strike and, ``We do support these actions. ... We are
of the opinion that wages are too low.''
   After the banning of Solidarity, the government organized an
officially sanctioned trade union alliance, which claims 7 million
members. At its height, Solidarity said it had 10 million members
in the country of 37 million people.

   A man serving life plus 20 years for
the contract murder of his wife planned a daring helicopter escape
but was thwarted Wednesday because the ``pilots'' he hired were
undercover agents, police said.
   Robert Spearman, 60, of Palm Beach Gardens was imprisoned at
Zephyrhills Correctional Institution for hiring two men to carry
out the slaying after answering their advertisement in Soldier of
Fortune magazine.
   Two undercover agents posing as pilots received $4,700 as a down
payment on a $54,700 contract to steal a helicopter and fly
Spearman out of the prison, said Ed Williams, agent in charge of
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Tampa office.
   Spearman asked the undercover agents to have two machine guns
and four hand grenades aboard the helicopter, authorities said.
   Spearman intended to use a grenade to kill his prosecutor, Palm
Beach County Assistant State Attorney Moria Lasch, said John Joyce,
an FDLE spokesman in Tallahassee.
   Spearman was charged with attempted escape and weapons offenses.
A suspected accomplice, Fred Douglas Laurent Jr. of Fort
Lauderdale, was charged with the same offenses but remained at
large, authorities said.
   Ms. Lasch said she had heard rumors of a death plot against her
but didn't know any specifics.
   ``I'm very grateful to the FDLE for doing such a good job and
catching him,'' she said.
   Joyce would not provide any details of how agents learned of the
alleged escape plot.
   ``He even knew what kind of helicopter he wanted,'' Williams
said, adding Spearman, a licensed pilot and marine contractor,
wanted one of two models that could take off and land without
moving forward.
   ``He said there's only one way that you can get in and out, drop
straight down and lift straight up,'' Williams said.
   In his murder trial, prosecutors said Spearman wanted to get rid
of his cancer-stricken wife, Anita, a former West Palm Beach
assistant city manager, because he had fallen in love with his
secretary and didn't want a costly divorce.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat will heighten the
Arab rebellion in the Israeli-occupied territories, senior aides
said Wednesday after meeting with Syrian leaders to cement a new
``strategic alliance.''
   Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam met until early Wednesday
with Arafat's aides. President Hafez Assad and Arafat took steps
toward reconciliation earlier this week after a five-year feud.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, who serves as foreign minister of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, led a delegation of three other top
officials of Fatah, the PLO's main guerrilla component and Arafat's
power base: Hayel Abdel-Hamid, Mohammed Rateb Ghoneim and Hani
Hassan.
   The meeting ended at 2 a.m. Kaddoumi and Abdel-Hamid left later
for Tunis, the PLO headquarters.
   Hassan and Ghoneim remained in Damascus for further talks on
joint action against Israel and the latest U.S. peace proposals for
the Middle East.
   George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, the second-largest PLO faction after Arafat's Fatah,
told reporters Arafat and Assad still differed on several points.
   He said one was Arafat's continuing good relations with Egypt,
which Syria condemns for its 1979 peace treaty with Israel, and
another was PLO relations with ``some Israelis.'' Habash, a staunch
ally of Syria, did not elaborate.
   Other points of conflict Habash mentioned were the Palestinian
role in Lebanon, where Syria is the main power broker, and how to
improve Fatah's relations with pro-Syrian Palestinian factions.
   Before leaving Damascus, Kaddoumi said no differences remained
between Syria and the PLO and ``only details'' had to be worked out.
   Arafat went to Baghdad from Damascus on Tuesday. PLO officials
in the Iraqi capital said he would meet with his commanders ``to
discuss ways of escalating the Palestinian uprising.''
   Attending will be members of the Emergency Committee set up in
January to coordinate Palestinian protests of Israeli rule in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip that began Dec. 8, the officials reported.
At least 174 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied
terrotories.
   PLO military commander Khalil Wazir led the committee but was
assassinated April 16 at his home in Tunis, apparently by an
Israeli commando unit.
   The slaying of Wazir, widely respected by both Arafat loyalists
and opponents, is seen as the catalyst that brought Arafat and
Assad together. Arafat arrived Sunday on his first visit to Syria
since Assad expelled him on June 24, 1983.
   Both leaders favor bolstering the Palestinian rebellion against
Israeli occupation and oppose the U.S. peace plan proposed in March
by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   It calls for limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and
Gaza, far short of the independent state Syria and the PLO demand.
   Kaddoumi said the PLO and Syria will seek ``Arab consensus'' on
the U.S. plan and on a strategy for the Palestinian uprising at a
special Arab summit planned for early June in Algiers.

   A wiretap was discovered on the office telephone
used by the head of the Air Line Pilots Association at Eastern
Airlines, the union said Wednesday.
   It was the third such discovery in 1{ years, said Ron Cole, a
union spokesman.
   He refused to speculate on the origin of the bug, which he said
was discovered by a security firm doing a routine ``sweep'' last
week of the union's Coral Gables headquarters.
   ``At this point in time I think it would be premature for us to
make any accusations,'' Cole said.
   ``These are troubled times at our airline,'' Cole said in a
statement. ``Industrial espionage such as this only serves to
heighten the stress.''
   Facing a possible strike by the Machinists union, the largest of
the three unions at Miami-based Eastern, management at the
financially-troubled carrier had held contract talks with ALPA that
broke off earlier this month.
   Coral Gables police Sgt. M. Ginn said Wednesday that his
department received a complaint about a wiretap at the ALPA
headquarters earlier this week.
   FBI agent Al Lamanna in Miami said his office had not received
any report of the ALPA wiretap.
   Duty officers at the Tallahassee and the Miami offices of the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement said they didn't know if
their agency was involved in the investigation.
   The bug was described by the union statement as a
``state-of-the-art listening device.'' It was found on the line
most frequently used by Jack Bavis, chairman of the ALPA local,
Cole said.
   ``The sophisticated parasitic transmitter device had the
capability to be accessed with a radio receiver up to several
hundred feet away from the building,'' the statement said.
   Cole said security experts could not yet tell how long it had
been in place.
   The discovery comes at a time when Eastern and its owner, Texas
Air Corp., are under close scrutiny over safety and management
practices. Earlier this month, Eastern was fined $823,500 for
various safety infractions.
   At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration started a
plane-by-plane inspection of Eastern and later of Continental
Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary.

   The parents of an American killed by
Contra rebels a year ago presented the government Wednesday with
$250,000 in donations to continue the development project on which
their son had worked.
   Benjamin Linder, an electrical engineer from Portland, Ore., was
killed along with six Nicaraguans on April 28, 1987, when rebels
attacked the small town of El Cua in northern Jinotega province.
   Linder had been helping in the construction of a small
hydroelectric plant.
   The check for $250,000 was delivered by his parents, David and
Elizabeth Linder, to Edwin Zablah, director of the Cesar Augusto
Sandino Foundation, a government agency which handles financing of
rural projects.
   Mrs. Linder said the money came from various donors in the
United States.
   The Linders, accompanied by their children David and Miriam,
were scheduled to travel Thursday to Matagalpa, about 100 miles
north of Managua, for a ceremony in the cemetery where Benjamin is
buried.
   Mrs. Linder said the family has filed a $50 million suit against
Contra leaders in Miami accusing them of being behind last year's
slaying.
   ``No lawsuit can bring Ben back,'' Mrs. Linder said at a news
conference, ``but by bringing the Contra leaders to justice we can
help change the policy that led to his death and the deaths of more
than 20,000 Nicaraguans.''
   The U.S.-backed Contras have fought the leftist Sandinista
government for 6{ years. They recently signed a cease-fire accord.

   A three-month strike by 2,000 ferry
workers in Dover spread on Wednesday to nearby Folkestone and Hull,
stopping sailings to the Continent.
   In Folkestone, five miles from Dover on the English Channel, two
Sealink U.K. Ltd. ferries stayed in port after crews failed to
report for work.
   North Sea Ferries, a subsidiary of P and O Ferries, suspended
nearly 100 workers in the eastern port of Hull after they walked
out in sympathy with the Dover strikers, whose picket lines
included seamen from across the country.
   The company said the workers refused to sail aboard its vessel
Norsea from Hull to the Continent on Tuesday night and were ``taken
off pay for 24 hours.'' Ken Turner, an official at Hull of the
National Union of Seamen, said the men stopped work to protest P
and O treatment of the Dover workers.
   The Dover ferrymen began a strike nearly three months ago over
company plans regarding pay and working conditions, which would
involve 360 layoffs.
   The company is trying to return to service two ferries stranded
in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, since the strike began. The ferries
were due to sail for Dover after British government officials
carried out safety checks.
   Nine other P and O ferries are stranded in the Netherlands and
France.

<HEAD>Judge Acquits 16 IRA Guerrillas Of Killing Prison Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Wednesday acquitted
16 Irish Republican Army guerrillas of murdering a prison guard
during the biggest prison escape in British history.
   However, the men were convicted of other charges in connection
with the escape by 38 IRA guerrillas from Belfast's top-security
Maze Prison on Sept. 25, 1983.
   A total of 18 men were found guilty of charges including escape
or attempted escape, falsely imprisoning guards, assault and
riotous behavior.
   They were given sentences ranging from three to eight years.
   Armed with smuggled knives and disguised as guards, the 38 shot
their way out of the prison on Belfast's outskirts. One guard died
and six others were wounded. All but nine of the guerrillas have
been recaptured.
   At the end of a three-month trial, Northern Ireland's
top-ranking judge, Lord Lowry, cleared the 16 of a charge of
fatally stabbing guard James Ferris with a screwdriver or a chisel.
   A pathologist had testified that Ferris suffered from a heart
ailment and the exact cause of death could not be determined.
   At the time of the breakout, most of the escapees had been
serving lengthy sentences for murder or attempted murder of British
soldiers or police officers.
   Among those convicted Wednesday were leaders of the escape team
_ Brendan McFarlane, 34, and Gerard Kelly, 33 _ who were sentenced
to five years for falsely imprisoning guards during the jail break.
   McFarlane led the 1981 hunger strike at Maze in which 10 men
starved themselves to death in an unsuccessful bid for official
recognition as political prisoners.
   He was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in a 1975
bomb and gun attack at a Protestant bar in Belfast in which five
men were killed.
   Kelly was jailed for life for his part in bombings in London in
1974 that wounded more than 100 people.
   The IRA is fighting to oust the British and unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republic. It is outlawed on both sides of the Irish border.
   The breakout was timed to coincide with the arrival of a
food-delivery truck at the prison. One group of inmates drove out
in the truck and others fled on foot after fighting with guards.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected an attempt to
bar federal spending on clean-needle programs for drug addicts at
risk of AIDS and braced for a series of controversial amendments to
a bipartisan AIDS bill.
   The vote was 66-18 against the amendment offered by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., to a fiscal 1989 AIDS spending blueprint sponsored
by Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   The amendment would have prevented the use of federal money for
programs in which drug addicts trade in dirty hypodermic needles in
exchange for clean ones so they don't spread the deadly AIDS virus.
   The Kennedy-Hatch AIDS research and information bill authorizes
$665 million for state and federal information and education
campaigns, home health care for AIDS patients, new hiring at the
National Institutes of Health and special projects targeted to drug
abusers and minorities. The bill also authorizes open-ended
research spending, expected to bring the total to about $1 billion.
   The questions of AIDS testing, confidentiality and
discrimination are addressed in a separate bill that has not
reached the House or Senate floor.
   But those and other inflammatory issues, such as mandatory
testing for marriage license applicants, were likely to come up in
amendments several senators planned to offer to the AIDS education
bill.
   ``The American people have a right to know where we stand on
routine testing ... and on the use of taxpayers' dollars to promote
sodomy,'' Helms said. ``I will strongly oppose the use of
taxpayers' money to advocate or condone sexual activity outside of
monogamous marriage.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons and its chief victims have
been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.
   Several senators said the Helms amendment on clean needles was
written so badly that it would have denied hospices, hospitals,
nursing homes and researchers the use of hypodermics and syringes.
And they said the federal government shouldn't tie the hands of
states, cities and researchers trying to curb the spread of the
fatal disease among intravenous drug users.
   ``Its only impact will be to destroy our ability to fight this
disease and find a cure,'' Hatch said of the Helms proposal.
   However, Helms later said he had rewritten his amendment to make
it more specific and won permission to offer it again Thursday.
   Helms and others have condemned educational materials aimed at
homosexual men, saying they promote sodomy.
   Among the many amendments Helms had on tap was a ban on federal
money for education or information materials that promote,
encourage or condone homosexual activities. A similar Helms
provision adopted last year on a 94-2 vote is due to expire Sept.
30.
   But at least one senator who voted for it last year said he had
changed his mind and would vote against when it came up again,
probably on Thursday.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he is convinced the amendment
is having fatal consequences because AIDS service organizations
have not received new money since last November. He said the
federal Centers for Disease Control had asked them not to apply for
funds until the situation is clarified.
   ``Promoting and encouraging homosexuality is simply not the
issue before us,'' Cranston said. ``What the government must do is
its utmost to save lives.... We must oppose every attempt to censor
vital lifesaving information about AIDS.''
   In action Wednesday on another Helms amendment, the Senate
overturned the District of Columbia's ban on AIDS testing for
insurance applicants.
   Helms said diabetics and many other groups of people are unable
to get health insurance because of their conditions. His amendment
prevailed on a quick voice vote despite arguments by others that
Congress should not override a law passed by the Disctrict of
Columbia City Council.
   As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500
Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000 have died since
June 1981, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   Intravenous drug users should be given free
needles and condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a
report prepared for the Canadian government and released Wednesday.
   The one-year study by the Royal Society of Canada urged federal
and provincial governments across Canada to spend $94 million
(U.S.) more each year on AIDS research, public education and
support services for victims.
   ``I see a lot of human suffering on a day-to-day basis and that
suffering can only grow unless we take action today,'' said Dr.
Chris Tsoukas, one of the authors of the report.
   The study rejected proposals for mandatory AIDS testing for
immigrants, teachers and other specific groups. But it said testing
clinics should be readily available to anyone who fears he or she
has the AIDS virus.
   The panel made 48 proposals, including compensation for those
infected with AIDS from a blood transfusion.
   Free distribution of condoms and needles to drug users, and
distribution of needle-cleaning equipment to prison inmates who use
drugs, were the most controversial recommendations.
   The Health Department gave no immediate indication of whether
the report would be implemented.
   According to Health Department statistics, there have been 1,665
confirmed cases of AIDS in Canada and 916 deaths.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease in which a
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of infections and cancers.
   It is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means
of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers.

   Iranians burned Uncle Sam in effigy on
Wednesday, paraded wreckage from a U.S. plane and shouted ``Death
to America!'' to mark the eighth anniversary of a failed mission to
rescue American hostages.
   The demonstration in Tabas, eastern Iran, not far from the
desert airstrip where eight U.S. servicemen were killed, was called
``Maneuver on the Defeat of America in Tabas,'' state-run Iranian
television said.
   Pieces of wreckage from an American C-130 cargo plane that
crashed with a helicopter during the rescue attempt were wheeled
through the town atop flatbed trucks.
   ``We will resist to the very last breath!,'' people in the crowd
chanted as Moslem clerics, soldiers and Revolutionary Guards
marched by.
   ``Death to America!,'' they shouted as a large effigy of Uncle
Sam, symbolizing the United States, was set ablaze. ``Khomeini will
never be abandoned!''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is the revolutionary and spiritual
patriarch of Iran.
   Portions of the rally were shown in the Iranian broadcast,
monitored in Cyprus, which appeared aimed partly at boosting morale
following U.S. attacks that sank an Iranian patrol boat and
crippled two frigates.
   The rally was held Wednesday, two days after the actual eighth
anniversary of the April 25, 1980 rescue attempt ordered by
then-President Jimmy Carter.
   The American crewmen were killed in the helicopter-cargo plane
collision as the commandos were leaving after the attempt was
called off because of helicopter malfunctions. The mission was to
rescue hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

   Greater freedom of information in the Soviet
Union has given Russians not only a better view of the world, but
an improved sense of history, Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said Wednesday.
   ``We have a real information explosion in our country now,''
Gerasimov told newspaper executives gathered here for the 102nd
Annual Convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association.
   Soviet journalists are now allowed to write about issues
affecting their country such as prostitution and drug problems, and
literary magazines that publish works by formerly dissident authors
have seen huge gains in circulation, he said.
   ``We write about (Soviet) history, where we have a very many
dark pages,'' he said.
   The climate for foreign journalists has also improved, with the
number of foreign correspondents almost doubling in the past five
years, he said.
   There are 51 American journalists in Moscow, compared to 35
Soviet correspondents in New York and Washington, Gerasimov said.
   The American media are always seeking greater access to the
Soviet Union, and Gerasimov said he expected even more foreign
journalists to be allowed.
   Gerasimov is the head of information for the Soviet Foreign
Ministry, and is known for chiding Americans with dry wit.
   Referring to former White House spokesman Larry Speakes'
disclosure in a book that he falsely attributed quotes to President
Reagan, Gerasimov said, ``As I understand it, I will be standing
right there at (White House spokesman) Marlin Fitzwater's side'' to
keep track of what President Reagan says at the upcoming Moscow
summit.
   ``I am sorry for Larry Speakes, because he cannot make from the
book the money he lost from Merrill Lynch,'' where he was forced to
resign from a public relations job, Gerasimov said.
   Gerasimov's speech on the last day of the three-day convention
was followed by a military briefing and address by Adm. Ronald J.
Hays. With Gerasimov still present, the commander of the U.S.
Pacific Command outlined an increasing Soviet military presence in
the Pacific as well as U.S. military capabilities there.
   Juan Bautista Sosa, Panama's ambassador to the United States, in
remarks prepared for delivery as a luncheon address, urged the
newspaper executives to hammer away at the restraints Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega had imposed against the press in Panama.
   Earlier Wednesday, the ANPA, which represents 1,400 newspapers
worldwide, formally elected officers and directors to its 22-member
board.
   The convention attracted more than 2,000 people representing 90
percent of the daily U.S. newspaper circulation.

   Navy salvage workers found the bodies of
three missing sailors at their stations aboard the drifting
submarine USS Bonefish on Wednesday, nearly three days after
explosions and fire forced the evacuation of the vessel.
   The Navy's top officer said the three crewmen may have died at
their posts while their 89 shipmates evacuated the vessel, filled
with smoke and toxic fumes from an explosion in a forward battery
compartment.
   ``Shortly after midnight, the salvage crew went aboard and
discovered the bodies,'' said Chief Petty Officer Terry D. Borton,
a spokesman at Atlantic Fleet headquarters here. ``Two of the
victims were discovered in the control room and the other in an
administrative compartment.''
   The crewmen were identified as Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of Naoma,
W.Va.; Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39, of
Willis, Texas; and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren,
21, of Pisgah Forest, N.C.
   Borton said he did not know when or where the bodies would be
returned to shore. The cause of death would not be known until a
medical examination was complete, he said.
   The 30-year-old, diesel-electric vessel was taken under tow by
the salvage ship USS Hoist, headed for the sub's home port of
Charleston, S.C., Chief Petty Officer Joseph C. Mowery, another
fleet spokesman, said late Wednesday.
   Mowery said the trip would take two to four days depending on
the weather.
   On Tuesday, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations,
said he believed the three died at their posts, perhaps ensuring
the safety of the other 89 sailors aboard the Bonefish.
   ``All three of those individuals... were on watch in the control
room and were last seen there. So it may well be that they simply
ensured that everyone got clear and they themselves did not make
it,'' he said.
   Crew members from the salvage ship USS Hoist went aboard the sub
Tuesday to close a hatch that had been left open, but no one
entered the vessel until later in the day when the venting of the
interior was completed. A team sent belowdecks discovered the
bodies, Borton said.
   The first explosion hit the sub's battery compartment at 4:40
p.m. Sunday. The ship was cruising at periscope depth at the time,
but the crew was able to bring it to the surface 160 miles east of
Port Canaveral, Fla. Once the ship surfaced, the crew was ordered
to evacuate.
   They were taken off the Bonefish by helicopter and whaleboat
from the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the frigate USS Carr,
both of which were participating in routine exercises with the sub.
   Of the 22 crewmen injured in the incident, 20 have been released
from the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville and returned to Charleston.
Nineteen of the injured were discharged Monday after a night in the
hospital.
   Explosions in battery compartments are one of a diesel
submariner's nightmares, according to one civilian expert.
   ``That's the typical way a diesel-electric submarine goes down
the tubes in peacetime,'' said Norman Friedman, author of
``Submarine Design and Development.''
   The 219-foot Bonefish is one of the Navy's few remaining
diesel-electric submarines. On the surface, it is powered by diesel
engines. When submerged, it runs off two electric motors powered by
massive storage batteries fore and aft.
   When these batteries are recharged _ when the ship is surfaced
or running at periscope depth _ hydrogen and other battery gases
are produced. Each of the batteries has a ventilating system to
discharge the gases.
   But, said Friedman, if those gases are allowed to build up, a
spark can set off a hydrogen explosion and fire.

   President Reagan told Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney on Wednesday to ``make no mistake, we are moving''
against environmental pollution, but Mulroney demanded more action
to stop U.S. acid rain from ``killing our lakes, soiling our
cities.''
   A senior U.S. official told reporters Mulroney gave Reagan
``some private ideas'' on how they might reach agreement on the
issue. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, could
offer no details on those ideas.
   At a welcoming ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House,
Reagan told the Canadian leader, ``More can be done to protect our
environment when science clearly points the way. Make no mistake,
we are moving.''
   The U.S. government contends that more needs to be done in
developing clean coal technology before targets and timetables can
be set for reducing coal-fired power plant emissions that Canadians
say are damaging their forests and lakes.
   Canada has been pressing for an agreement on a timetable to
reduce emissions to specified levels. In an interview before
leaving Ottawa, Mulroney likened the U.S. acid-rain emissions to
this country ``dumping garbage'' on its northern neighbor.
   Asked about this as the two leaders posed for photographers
before their meeting in the Oval Office, Mulroney said, ``I think
it's very clear that acid rain has that effect on the environment
in the eastern United States and Canada, yes. I think that's a
normal fact.''
   Mulroney pleaded before a joint meeting of Congress for what he
acknowledged would be expensive programs to clean up U.S.
emissions, which he said caused half the acid rain that has killed
15,000 Canadian lakes and threatened or damaged 300,000 more.
   ``Half of our acid rain comes across the border, directly from
the United States, falling upon our forests, killing our lakes,
soiling our cities,'' Mulroney told Congress.
   ``It is despoiling your environment as inexorably as our,'' he
said. ``It is damaging your environment as inexorably as it is
ours. It is damaging your environment from Michigan to Maine, and
threatens marine life on the Eastern Seabord.''
   He said Canadian acid rain wafting to the United States will be
halved by his government's programs. ``We ask nothing more than
this from you.''
   ``We invite the administration, and the leadership of Congress,
to conclude an accord whereby we agree on a schedule and targets
for reducing acid rain that crosses our border,'' he said. ``The
cost of reducing acid rain is substantial, but the cost of inaction
is greater still.
   ``What would be said of a generation of North Americans that
found a way to explore the stars, but allowed its lakes and forests
to languish and die?''
   Reagan agreed later in a toast at a state dinner in Mulroney's
honor ``there is much still to be done'' on acid rain but said
``progress is being made.''
   The Canadian prime minister called the occasion ``the last of
our home and home visits'' and said he believed they had become
``part of the institutional relationship between Canada and the
United States.''
   The president, asked what steps the United States was taking to
meet Mulroney's concerns, said, ``Well, we've been trying to work
on it.''
   Mulroney described the issue as a ``very complicated
trans-boundary problem'' and said, ``I hope we get a solution. I
don't expect anything within moments, but we have been making
movement, and we hope to make a lot more.''
   In his response to Reagan at the welcoming ceremony, Mulroney
said, ``This, as you said in Quebec City, Mr. President, is a
problem that belongs to both of us. We must continue and we shall
to work together for an equitable solution to this important
challenge.''
   The two leaders first met in 1985 in Quebec City, then followed
up with meetings in Washington in 1986 and in Ottawa last April. At
that meeting, Reagan said he would ``consider the prime minister's
proposal for a bilateral accord on acid rain.'' Canada, however, is
dissatisfied with the U.S. follow-up to this commitment.
   ``The prime minister said he continues to believe that an accord
should be possible and gave the president some private ideas on
what might be in the accord,'' the senior administration official
said. The official said Reagan's reaction, in effect, was, `We will
look at them.''
   At Wednesday's meeting, Reagan gave his permission for Canada to
buy tightly held U.S. nuclear submarine technology. Ottawa is
considering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclear-powered attack
submarines, either from Britain or France.
   Because the British ``Trafalgar'' class subs use American power
plants, U.S. permission will be required if the Canadians pick the
British design.
   The official said Reagan informed Mulroney that he would approve
the technology transfer _ making Canada the first nation outside
Britain to be eligible to acquire the technology. Action by
Congress is also required.
   Reagan and Mulroney also discussed the pending free trade
agreement between the United States and Canada and said they do not
believe it will be endangered by Reagan's threatened veto of a
trade bill being considered in the Senate, the official reported.
   Reagan addressed Mulroney as ``Brian'' throughout the welcoming
ceremony. The prime minister addressed Reagan as ``Mr. President''
and saluted him as ``a leader of warmth and directness.''
   Turning to the trade agreement, now pending before the Canadian
Parliament and to be submitted to Congress in June, Reagan
predicted that both legislative bodies would approve it.
   ``Protectionism is out,'' he said. ``Trade expansionism is in.''
   Mulroney said ``both countries stand to gain'' from the measure,
which would reduce tariffs.

<HEAD>U.S. Team Surveys Crash Site, Prepares For Joint Excavation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American military experts have
inspected the wreckage of a downed aircraft in Laos and plan to
search for remains of missing Americans, a U.S. Embassy spokesman
said Wednesday.
   The Americans returned to Bangkok Tuesday after the preliminary
survey of the crash site in Savannakhet province, said embassy
spokesman Ross Petzing. Other U.S. experts will join them in a few
days to begin the excavation, he said.
   Petzing said 14 to 16 Americans would be involved in the digging
in Savannakhet, in Laos' panhandle area between Thailand and
Vietnam. The excavation will be the third U.S.-Laotian search for
remains of the 555 Americans listed as missing in action in Laos
from the Indochina war.
   The inspection team ``found wreckage of an aircraft, and there
was a crater there,'' Petzing said. ``They found mechanical parts
of the aircraft and have advised the manufacturer to try to
determine which aircraft it was.''
   The seven-man team was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, commander of
the Honolulu-based U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center. The
center traces Americans missing in foreign wars.
   Petzing said he could not give a precise location of the crash
site. But another U.S. official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was east of Savannakhet city.
   Several American aircraft were shot down in the area while on
missions to attack the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which was used by the
North Vietnamese communists to infiltrate men and supplies into
South Vietnam.
   The previous joint excavations were held in February 1985 in
Pakse province and in February 1986 in Savannakhet.
   Laos agreed in August last year to accelerate progress on the
MIA issue while the United States pledged to respond to its calls
for humanitarian assistance.
   In mid-February, Laos handed over two boxes of remains believed
to be those of missing Americans.

<HEAD>AIDS Costs Pegged At $6.8 Million For Four Hollywood Unions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of Hollywood's union health
insurance funds spent $6.8 million by early this year on medical
care for 138 AIDS patients, a representative of producers and
studios said Wednesday.
   Because some AIDS insurance claims may be reported as related
diseases rather than AIDS, ``I'm sure these statistics are
understated,'' said J. Nicholas Counter III, president of the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   Despite the costs of caring for the entertainment industry's
AIDS patients and the prospect of even more patients, ``it appears
we do have the resources to deal with the problem and will not go
bankrupt in doing so,'' Counter said at a conference titled
``Managing AIDS at Work.''
   Counter's remarks represent the first time anyone has attempted
to compile statistics on the number of AIDS patients whose care is
being paid by health insurance funds serving the entertainment
industry's five major unions.
   The insurer providing coverage for one of those funds _ the
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists Health and
Retirement Funds _ refused to provide statistics on the number of
AFTRA's 22,000 members with AIDS or the cost of their care, said
alliance government affairs specialist Dan Goldberg, who compiled
the statistics for Counter.
   They four funds that provided figures are: the Screen Actors
Guild-Producers Health Fund, which covers roughly 25,000 guild
members; the Motion Picture Industry Health and Welfare fund, which
covers about 20,000 members of the International Alliance of
Theatrical and Stage Employees; the Writers Guild of America
Industry Health Fund, which covers 4,000 guild members, and the
Directors Guild of America Pension and Health and Welfare Fund,
which covers about 3,000 union members. Not all union members are
covered by the programs.
   Goldberg said that as of mid-February, 72 AIDS cases had been
reported to the SAG insurance fund, 43 to IATSE's fund, 14 to the
Writers Guild's, and nine to the Directors Guild's, for a total of
138 patients, many of whom have died.
   Some people have suggested the incidence of AIDS in the
entertainment industry might be high because of a disproportionate
number of homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers and a greater
number of sexual partners.
   But Counter said: ``I don't see that this problem is any worse
or any less in our industry than in all industries.''
   The $6.8 million figure cited by Counter for the cost of care
for 138 patients works out to just under $49,500 per patient.
   ``With efficient case management and progressive insurance
company policies, the cost per patient can be held in the
neighborhood of $35,000 to $50,000,'' which is roughly comparable
with the cost of treating cancer and heart disease patients,
Counter said.

   Wallace E. Johnson, a co-founder of the
Holiday Inns hotel chain, died of a heart attack Wednesday at age
86.
   Johnson, who died at Baptist Hospital, was a home builder with a
successful construction company who in 1953 founded Holiday Inns
Hotel Courts, later called Holiday Inns Inc., with Memphis
businessman Kemmons Wilson Jr.
   Their company was the foundation of what now is Holiday Corp.,
the world's largest hotel and casino chain.
   Johnson retired in 1977 and Wilson in 1979.
   Johnson re-entered the home building industry in 1987, joining a
group of investors who formed a company to build houses for
moderate and low-income buyers.
   He had no survivors. Funeral services were scheduled for
Saturday.

   Stella Nickell, accused of killing her husband
and a woman with cyanide-laced Excedrin, tearfully testified
Wednesday that she never talked of murdering her husband and
researched poison only after his death.
   Mrs. Nickell described Bruce Nickell, 52, as a loving,
good-natured husband with a sense of humor. She denied telling
family members her marriage was unhappy or had grown boring since
they both stopped drinking in 1979.
   ``I believe that my feelings grew a lot stronger'' after the
drinking stopped, the 44-year-old Mrs. Nickell said. ``We got along
a lot better.''
   She acknowledged periodic financial problems and stress,
including filing for bankruptcy in 1983, but denied that money
arguments had threatened the marriage or that she saw collecting on
Nickell's life insurance as an easy solution.
   The trial is the first in the nation involving a person charged
with causing death by tampering with over-the-counter medicine.
   Defense attorney Tom Hillier gently led his client through an
emotional recounting of her husband's collapse in 1986. She sobbed
earlier in the day as a pathologist described Nickell's autopsy.
   On the night of his death, he took four Excedrin, she said. When
Hillier asked her why, she quoted her husband as saying, ``Because
that's what I need.''
   A few moments later, she said, he told her he felt like he was
about to pass out.
   ``He squatted down ... shook his head. He wouldn't answer me. He
stood up ... put his hands on the couch to brace himself, and
collapsed,'' she said.
   Mrs. Nickell denied the testimony of her daughter, Cindy
Hamilton, that she had discussed several possible ways to kill her
husband.
   Mrs. Nickell said she researched cyanide only after Nickell's
death because ``I wanted to know what it was that killed my
husband.''
   Asked about testimony by an FBI specialist that 84 of her
fingerprints were found on a book on poisonous plants called
``Deadly Harvest,'' Mrs. Nickell said she was trying to learn about
such plants to protect her granddaughter and children she babysat
from any dangers around her suburban Auburn home.
   She acknowledged she signed her husband's insurance forms,
saying he ``despised paperwork.'' She said she thought he had
$25,000 in life insurance.
   Prosecutors, who are expected to cross-examine Mrs. Nickell on
Thursday, contend she hoped to collect on as much as $176,000 in
insurance.
   They contend she put cyanide in other over-the-counter pain
relievers in order to make her husband's death appear the work of a
random killer.
   She is also accused in the death of Sue Katherine Snow, 40, of
Auburn, who died after swallowing an Excedrin capsule containing
cyanide in 1986.

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday arrested 11
striking construction workers and auto mechanics who were
demonstrating in Managua, according to labor officials.
   Rolando Velazquez, a labor leader, said in a telephone interview
that five of the arrested workers were beaten up by police.
   The 11 arrested were demonstrating to show support for a
two-month-old strike by about 1,500 construction workers and auto
mechanics demanding higher pay and better working conditions.
   The leftist Sandinista government, which controls most of the
economy, has refused to bow to the strikers' demands. It contends
the country's war-battered economy cannot afford raises.
   The striking workers are affiliated with the General Federation
of Labor, an independent organization that opposes the government.
   Velazquez, a federation leader, said five of the strikers were
``arrested, beaten and dragged by the police'' outside the
confederation headquarters. The other six were picked up outside
automobile dealerships, he said.
   William Alvarado, one of the detained strikers, claimed in an
interview: ``The police beat us up, and they used paralyzing gases
against those of us they could not control.''
   He said he was taken to a local police station but while the
other men were being processed, he escaped from the building.
   Speaking to reporters Tuesday, President Daniel Ortega called
the strikers ``workers without a class conscience and unclear
political aims,'' adding that ``they should be holding these
protests outside the U.S. Embassy.''
   Ortega has blamed Nicaragua's economic ills on the Reagan
administration's economic sanctions against the country and its
support of Contra rebels. The guerrillas fought the Sandinistas for
6{ years but recently signed a cease-fire accord.
   ``There can be no doubt that those who have been carrying out a
repressive policy, causing economic difficulties and murdering
people and the Nicaraguan workers with its criminal and terrorist
policy is Reagan,'' Ortega said.
   The federation, which claims a membership of 100,000 workers, is
one of the country's biggest labor organizations and is closely
linked to the opposition Socialist Party.

   Three dummy rockets fell off a National
Guard jet at 11,000 feet, landing without injury on state property,
officials said Wednesday.
   The rockets, which are used for practice, have lead warheads and
contain no explosives, said officials of the 182nd Tactical Air
Support Group.
   A 6-foot, 180-pound pod containing the rockets fell off the A-37
Dragonfly fly shortly after takeoff Saturday and landed east of
Tremont, a small town about 15 miles southeast of Peoria, Lt. Col.
John Bidelman said Wednesday.
   The cause of the accident is under investigation, said Maj.
Sandy Cain, deputy group commander.
   The pod and rockets could have caused serious injury or death if
they had fallen in a residential area, said Cain. The pod is a
cylinder that hangs on the wing of the plane; the rockets are fired
from the pod.
   The accident was reported by the pilot and a private citizen,
said Cain.
   ``We were very fortunate we found it right away,'' he said. ``It
could easily have fallen into a ravine and we never would have
found it.''

<HEAD>Catholic Workers: After Dorothy Day, a Crisis of Continuity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker
movement, died in 1980, a reporter asked one of her followers:
``What will you do now?''
   ``Bury her,'' he said.
   It was an answer Day would have liked, for her faith was in good
works, not personal charisma.
   But Catholics to whom she was a heroine will not be comforted by
a new study which implies that the Workers are burying their
founder figuratively, as well as literally.
   In ``Beyond Charismatic Leadership,'' Sister Michele Teresa
Aronica, a sociologist who teaches at St. Joseph's College in
Maine, accuses some of Day's followers of straying from her radical
commitment to serve the poor and promote pacifism.
   With no Dorothy Day to guide it _ and no program for teaching
new members about her life and philosophy _ the New York Catholic
Worker runs the risk of becoming ``simply another social service
agency,'' Aronica warns.
   Aronica spent several months in 1984 at the Workers' ``houses of
hospitality'' on the impoverished Lower East Side of Manhattan. She
describes a group at once too hierarchical to satisfy Day's
insistence on individual responsibility, yet too unorganized to
preserve her memory.
   And, in an increasingly hostile and stressful environment _ the
Lower East Side was being flooded with homeless people, many of
them addicts or former mental patients _ ``these folks were very
concerned with trying to maintain the organization, even at the
expense of serving the poor,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   The changes Aronica observed included watered-down soup in the
famous Catholic Worker soup line and the use of a personal computer
to mail the Catholic Worker newspaper.
   One unhappy Worker complained that the Catholic Worker ``used to
have the reputation of being the best soup in the city, but these
young people decide they are going to experiment and do it their
own way instead of learning to make a good stew.''
   ``It's hot water, man,'' one homeless man complained. ``Who the
hell wants to wait in line for that?''
   The Catholic Worker newspaper, the movement's voice and primary
source of income, is issued less frequently, with contributions
from fewer workers. And Day _ who valued manual labor and
mistrusted technology _ would have been appalled by the purchase of
a computer to address subscriptions, some insisted.
   Aronica also found the Worker had ``only a token commitment'' to
pacifism and disarmament, even though Day opposed every war from
Benito Mussolini's in Ethiopia to Lyndon Johnson's in Vietnam.
   Friday night meetings, once dedicated to discussing the thought
of Day and Worker co-founder Peter Maurin instead feature lectures
on a variety of subjects, with the result that the founders' ideas
``are not systematically or consistently presented or discussed
within the group.''
   Aronica warns: ``If the spirit or the vision is not passed on to
the membership, the Catholic Worker runs the risk of becoming just
another one of the many facilities which offer services to the
indigent.''
   She also complains that the theoretically anarchical Worker is
in fact governed by a leadership ``elite'' which decides who comes
and who goes. In theory, anyone can join the Worker; in fact,
Aronica reports, street people were served, but not treated as
equals.
   Asked about Aronica's study, Tim Lambert, managing editor of the
Catholic Worker newspaper, admitted, ``We fail constantly to live
Dorothy's vision. But we're still trying, and her vision is still
alive.''
   The adjustment to a founder's death ``is something every
movement has faced,'' Lambert said. ``But so much time here is
spent answering the knock on the door. In that way, there's a
continuity that won't go away. That's where our life is centered.''
   The newspaper circulation has dropped because the Workers
stopped distributing copies that were going unread, he explained.
As for the soup, he said, the quality varies, ``every morning it's
something different.''
   Whatever the Worker's problems in New York, the movement appears
healthy outside the city. There are at least 100 other Worker
groups around the country _ twice as many as when Day was alive.
About 500 Workers gathered in Las Vegas, Nev., late last year for
her 90th birthday, a celebration that included a demonstration at a
nuclear test site.
   At any rate, those particularly interested in the movement's
traditional center are offered some sound advice by a young
volunteer Aronica interviewed: ``The only way to really get a sense
of the Worker is to come and see it.''

   The actors portraying the terror aboard an
airliner hijacked to Lebanon sometimes used jokes to get through
the tense, emotional scenes, says Lindsay Wagner, who stars as
courageous flight attendant Uli Derickson.
   ``There are moments of humor,'' said Wagner of the NBC movie,
``The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story.'' NBC will
televise the two-hour movie Monday.
   ``It was the only way to survive aboard the plane. And when we
did the heavy scenes, we'd break up trying to get through it. The
emotions would become so overpowering you had to have relief.''
   To an extent, she said, that was also one way the real-life
hostages aboard the TWA jet coped with fear after two terrorists
seized the plane June 17, 1985, on a flight from Athens to Rome.
   It was Derickson who emerged as a heroine during the hijacking,
in which the plane was diverted to Beirut, flew to Algiers, then
returned to Beirut. She helped get some passengers released and
attempted to conceal the identities of the Jewish passengers.
   One passenger, a young Navy frogman named Robert Stethem, was
beaten then shot to death by the terrorists. The other passengers
and crew were eventually released. Derickson was among those
released early.
   ``She was very human,'' said Wagner. ``She ended up doing some
extraordinary things. There were times when she was crying and her
hands were shaking, but she didn't freeze up. She pushed through
her emotions. One terrorist made her sing `Patty Cake' in German,
then proposed marriage to her.''
   Most of the movie was filmed in a mockup of the airplane's
cabin, a small and cramped space.
   ``They were never allowed off the plane,'' she said. ``We shot a
few scenes at Los Angeles International Airport, including one
where we had to use the emergency chute exit. The entire fire
department at the airport came and watched. They'd never seen one
used before.
   ``We sometimes lost track of where we were, Algiers or Beirut.
We filmed mostly in that little space. You don't realize how much
you're influenced by visual stimuli. We kept asking ourselves,
`Where are we now? Algiers or Beirut?'''
   Derickson, who is still flying with TWA, was a consultant for
the film.
   ``I asked her things like what it was like moment to moment,''
said Wagner. ``She was on the set if I had any questions. (For)
some things you can simply use your own instinct, but when you had
a choice I wanted her input. She also relayed some of the little
anecdotes. She was very good in helping me create moments.
   ``She passed out aspirin to the passengers to keep their body
temperatures down. The air conditioning was off and the plane was
very hot in the desert sun. She told me she thought she was doing a
good job looking cool when a woman grabbed her arm and said, `I
think you should take some too, dear.'''
   Wagner is best known for ``The Bionic Woman,'' which ran on ABC
from 1976 to 1978. She and Lee Majors, who was ``The Six Million
Dollar Man,'' made a reunion movie last year for NBC. Her last
series, ``Jessie,'' lasted only briefly in 1984.
   She said she'd consider doing another series, if it's a
half-hour comedy.
   ``I don't want to do another hour show,'' she said. ``We haven't
been able to come up with the right property yet. Usually, you have
too much. That's been one of the ironies of my career.''
   Wagner was also in the miniseries ``Scruples'' and ``Princess
Daisy.'' Her theatrical films include ``The Paper Chase'' and
``High Risk,'' a caper movie that has become something of a cult
classic.

<HEAD>First RepublicBank Bailout Gets Mixed Review in Texas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is off today. Also on financial wire</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMARILLO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent Texas bankers are upset the
government is providing unlimited coverage for First RepublicBank
Corp.'s depositors, although many also say the problems of the
state' biggest banking company have brought them increased deposits.
   ``The discrimination caused by the FDIC's fully insuring First
RepublicBank is bleeding all Texas banks that are fortunate enough
not to be in a failing condition,'' top officials of the
Independent Bankers Association of Texas said recently in a letter
to William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   In the letter, association Executive Director F. Hagen McMahon
Jr. and President Scott Smith of Sherman's American Bank protested
the unlimited insurance provision and a greater willingness by
regulators to close ailing small banks rather than rescue them.
   They accused the FDIC of slandering and threatening the
management of independent banks closed by regulators, while public
statements about First RepublicBank's troubles blamed outside
economic forces rather than management.
   ``Let us point out that our bankers live in the same economy as
the bankers working for First RepublicBank,'' Smith and McMahon
wrote.
   Normally, the FDIC insures individual deposits up to $100,000.
   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said the full-insurance solution for
First RepublicBank was the best one under the circumstances to
ensure the safety of the Texas banking industry. But he
acknowledged the guarantee causes disparity among the state's banks.
   Texas has 1,400 independent banks, each averaging $44 million in
deposits, according to figures compiled by the banking association.
   Of the 71 Texas banks closed in 1987 and 1988, all but a handful
were independent, so a slight influx in deposits from troubled
larger banks is small comfort to most independent bankers.
   ``I would say that the independent banking community _ for the
lack of a better word _ has benefited, or our deposits have
increased, due to the problems that the larger banks are having,''
said McMahon.
   Last month, the association's bankers reported they not only
were gaining deposits from the First RepublicBank system, but
people were also moving safe-deposit boxes.
   ``Any time that a customer will go to the trouble of moving his
safe-deposit box, that is a good indication that core deposits are
flowing into our banks, not just temporary hot-money movement,''
McMahon said.
   But those added deposits could be a mixed blessing as demand for
loans continues to drop in Texas, said Stephen Skaggs, a vice
president at Alex Sheshunoff & Co., a leading bank consulting firm
in Austin.
   ``It could be an opportunity for a financially healthy, sound
bank which has loan demand to profitably make use of the deposit
growth that comes from the troubled banks in the state,'' Skaggs
said. ``But growth in and of itself without having a way to deploy
those deposits is not necessarily advantageous.
   ``If you don't have anywhere to put the money and suddenly you
grow by $20 million, then what's really the advantage?''
   But where loan demand does exist, larger independents with money
to lend hope they can fill the lending void left by ailing holding
companies.
   ``Out-of-state lenders are scared to make loans or invest here,
and the major Texas people have their hands tied,'' said Richard
Ware II, president of Amarillo National Bank, one of the state's
biggest independents.
   Ware's bank, owned and operated by his family for four
generations, works with other independents to assemble large loan
deals that his bank, with assets of $630.8 million, would not be
able to do on its own.
   Ware said while his bank's profits are down, the bank remains
profitable because its loan portfolio lacks the heavy exposure in
real estate loans that burned it big-city counterparts.
   The rush toward real estate lending by most holding companies
illustrates a strength of independent banking _ independent
thinking, he said.
   ``This concentration (of lenders) all starts thinking one way,
and they all went into real estate lending and it got 'em,'' Ware
said. ``So I think there's some strength in the independent concept
in that you're diversified, you have different management, you have
different deposit bases. That's a strength that will allow us to
get through this.''

<HEAD>Unusual Look Behind Scenes of Supreme Court on PBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditionally camera-shy justices of the
Supreme Court are the subjects of a PBS documentary starting Monday
that gives viewers a look behind the scenes of the most secluded
branch of government.
   The marble temple, as the Supreme Court building is called,
holds the offices of eight men and a woman who occasionally give
formal interviews, but never before have allowed television cameras
to film them talking to each other about their work.
   ``You get some sense of how they interact with each other,''
said Steve York, executive producer of the two-part series created
for the Public Broadcasting Service by WETA-TV in Washington.
   While the general public may not be duly impressed by such
access, said York, ``to those who spend a lot of time, really
seasoned court watchers, scholars and reporters, it is a very big
deal.''
   The two-hour ``This Honorable Court'' will be shown in two
parts, the second on Monday, May 9. Air dates and times can vary on
local PBS stations.
   The first segment explores the history of the court, using
archival film footage and interviews with legal experts to create
an engaging story about its growth from seeming insignificance in
the early days of the republic to a powerful and active third
branch of government.
   For the casual viewer, it is the easier of the two segments to
watch, a concise history lesson that demonstrates how the court has
changed itself and society.
   One portion shows Thurgood Marshall, now a senior justice, as
the young civil rights attorney who brought Brown vs. The Board of
Education to the court and helped change forever the government's
position on the treatment of blacks in public facilities.
   The first hour also delves into the politics behind the
appointment of the individual justices and the battles between the
presidents and the court.
   It covers the controversy over President Franklin Roosevelt's
effort to pack the court when it ruled against New Deal
legislation, the attempt by President Nixon to turn the Warren
court into a more conservative body and President Reagan's problems
with his nomination of Robert Bork.
   In the second hour, the series takes on a deeply respectful tone
and reporter-narrator Paul Duke avoids controversy in his questions
to the justices.
   ``The justices do not talk about pending cases or the politics
of the court,'' said producer York. ``When it's a given, they are
not going to talk about it and you know they aren't, let them talk
about what they will talk about. There is enough there to give you
a sense of how the court works that never has been discussed
before.''
   Indeed, there is nothing in the series to rile the justices.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist, at a reception before excerpts
of the series were previewed, praised the producers for pursuing
the program in an ``understanding, thoughtful and careful way.''
   ``All of the members of the court family think that WETA did a
remarkably good job in making this film,'' he said.
   Later, after the viewing, he said, ``It has a sense of humanity
about it.''
   ``I'm not a TV star,'' retired Justice Lewis Powell said, while
adding, ``I think it will be very informative.''
   ``I thought it was all right. I didn't mind it at all,'' said
Justice Byron White.
   York credits Rehnquist for making the court so accessible to the
film crew, and Duke mentions that the chief justice has often been
praised for bringing a new openness to the court.
   Generally, the tone of the program is serious as the justices
discuss their attitudes about their job, but an occasional light
exchange spills through.
   York said that during the year he worked on the series he was
impressed by the respect the justices show for one another, despite
deep differences in philosophy.
   ``You realized the way the justices get along with each other
does affect the process,'' he said.

   Leon Levy and Jack Nash, founders of Odyssey
Partners, are the odd couple of big money investment partnerships.
   The absent-minded Levy and Nash, his action-oriented partner of
35-plus years, are about to add $530 million in assets from the
break-up of textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co. to Odyssey's
collection of investments.
   Initially viewed as the white knight that would rescue Stevens
from the clutches of West Point-Pepperell Inc., Odyssey ultimately
forged a deal with Pepperell to divvy up the fabric maker's assets.
   As Odyssey gets ready to add the Stevens operations to its
collection, analysts are scratching their heads wondering whether
Odyssey will keep the carpeting, unfinished cloth and automotive
fabrics businesses over the long term.
   But partner Brian D. Young, who joined Odyssey two years ago,
pointed to the firm's track record of holding onto its investments,
unlike other investment companies that might feel pressed to turn a
quick buck.
   Odyssey will leave the running of the Stevens businesses to
division managers, and no layoffs are expected, Young said.
   The partnership has stakes valued at about $350 million in 50
private and public companies that cover the waterfront _ from a bus
manufacturer to a furniture retailer to supermarkets to real estate
to an insurance company, among others.
   ``You will see mature businesses (in the portfolio), not
start-ups, and you won't see high-tech,'' said R. Todd Lang, a New
York attorney who has had a 20-year relationship with Nash and Levy.
   Indeed, Odyssey's investment credo, as stated in a privately
circulated brochure, is to avoid ``a company whose principal
product it does not understand.''
   The partnership looks for strong management, undervalued assets
and a defendable market position, the company says in its 1988
brochure. Analysts agree that Stevens' assets generally fit the
criteria.
   ``They must be relying on a projection that these businesses are
really going to take off,'' said one source close to the Stevens
transaction.
   Analysts note that Odyssey is familiar with the fabric and home
furnishings industries. The partnership owns 21 percent of Leslie
Fay Companies Inc., one of the largest makers of women's clothing
in the United States, and it has stakes in children's apparel
makers Brinlaw Co. and M&L International Co., and Liberty Fabrics,
which makes knitted fabrics.
   Nash and Levy met in the early 1950s at the New York investment
firm Oppenheimer & Co., where they built up the mutual funds and
brokerage operations. In 1982 Oppenheimer sold its subsidiaries in
the financial services industry and left the duo with about $50
million to set up their own investment boutique, which they dubbed
Odyssey in an allusion to their risky journey into uncharted
opportunities.
   The firm's 90 limited partners have seen an impressive return on
their money. The ``deal'' side is only part of Odyssey's business _
the partnership also manages about $500 million in marketable
securities.
   Levy, Nash and their partners avoid the press. ``We're a private
firm,'' Young said in a rare interview. ``We all came from public
firms, and one reason we're here is we like our privacy.''
   According to Young, ``We say what we are legally required to
say, but that doesn't mean people need to know what goes on at
Odyssey.''
   Those who know them say Levy, 62, and Nash, 58, are perfect
partners. Levy has been described as a visionary whose mind wanders
out beyond the year 2000, while Nash's feet are firmly planted in
the here-and-now.
   It was Levy who five years ago spotted the Chicago Milwaukee
Corp., parent of a bankrupt railroad. The company emerged from
bankruptcy and was pretty much dismembered, leaving Odyssey with 48
percent of a company that now is comprised mostly of cash,
securities and real estate rumored to be valued at $400 million.
   Levy also singled out Monarch Capital Corp., a Springfield,
Mass., financial services firm specializing in life and disability
insurance because he was convinced variable life insurance was the
product of the future.
   ``We were the only public company out there in the variable life
insurance business'' in 1983, said Monarch Chairman Gordon Oakes.
Odyssey's stake is valued at about $28 million, Oakes said.
   Preferring to work with management on friendly terms, Odyssey
typically suggests leveraged buyouts. But the partners have not
always been met with open arms.
   Earlier this month Odyssey reported to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it might seek control of UNC Inc., an
Annapolis, Md.-based defense firm in which it holds a 5.8 percent
stake.
   The filing came after the partners approached UNC management
about a leveraged buyout at ``prices that didn't seem to benefit
shareholders,'' said one source close to the company.
   After the filing, UNC President Dan Colussy called Odyssey's
statement about a potential takeover ``unfortunate,'' adding that
the company regards ``such statements as extremely disruptive and
harmful to UNC's business.''
   As for Odyssey's atypical entry into a bidding war with
Pepperell over Stevens, one source close to the partnership said:
``Most sophisticated money groups have to participate in these
auctions or there's no deals to do these days.''
   Friends of Odyssey are still defending the company's skirmish
with Transworld Corp., which began in 1982, as ``ahead of its
time.''
   At the time Levy was talking about ``disaggregation,'' a concept
he described in a 1983 Fortune magazine article as ``liberating a
conglomerate's operating companies as a way of realizing their
values and improving their efficiency.''
   After an unsuccessful proxy fight in which Odyssey proposed
converting Transworld divisions into independent companies, the
partners had lunch with then-chairman L. Edwin Smart. ``There was a
degree of gentlemanliness to (the meeting), and a degree of wanting
to throw another thought on the table,'' Smart recalled.
   A year after its run-in with Odyssey, the company spun off its
airline subsidiary, Trans World Airlines Inc., to concentrate on
its food and lodgings operations. The company, which later sold
other assets, is now known as TW Services Inc.
   Though the proxy fight occurred years ago, Smart vividly
remembers his encounter with Odyssey. ``Obviously they're very
intelligent people, and they are also very aggressive people,'' he
said.

his current campaign Jackson traveled the world far and wide,
acquiring foreign policy experience during trips financed in large
part by black church groups and business supporters and in some
measure by sympathetic political groups or foreign nations.
   The Democratic contender's most recent financial disclosure
form, which presidential candidates are required to submit, shows
he had assets worth a minimum of $347,010, and possibly much more.
   He owns modest houses in Chicago's Sand to South Korea where he visited
dissident leader Kim Dae-jung, who was under house arrest at the
time.
   Rev. Joseph Ahne, a Chicago pastor who helped organize the trip,
said the air fare and other expenses for Jackson and five others
were paid by a coalition of human rights groups from Japan. The
South Korean leg of the trip was paid for by that country's
National Council of Churches, Ahne said.
   ``Usually, when we go abroad we are the guests of some human
rights organization or some church or (are at) the courtesy of some
government,'' Jackson said. ``Or if we must pay, we simply target
the money for that particular trip and raise it.''

   During his 1984 presidential campaign, for instance, Jackson
raised the money for two major trips to Latin America. He traveled
to Mexico City in June 1984 and to Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua
and Cuba the following month.
   Neither trip was paid for by Jackson's presidential campaign.
Supporters were asked instead to donate to a ``humanitarian fund''
set up by campaign attorney Edward Coaxum, Jackson said.
   Coaxum, a Cleveland attorney, didn't return repeated telephone
calls seeking further information and Jackson spokesman Watkins
said he didn't know how much the fund raised or whether it was
incorporated.
   It isn't unusual for public figures to travel abroad at someone
else's expense. Foreign governments frequently invite congressmen,
by themselves or in delegations, to visit, and absorb the costs.
Candidates sometimes use funds from their political action
committees for trips that burnish their foreign policy credentials.
   While Jackson has traveled abroad extensively, he apparently
hasn't drawn a regular salary since stepping down as the head of
PUSH in 1983 to wage his first presidential campaign, according to
his financial disclosure forms and PUSH financial records.
   From 1978 through 1980, he was paid about $50,000 a year as the
national president of PUSH. He received $54,615 in both 1981 and
1982, the last year that he drew a salary from the organization,
according to PUSH records filed with the Illinois attorney
general's office.
   In 1983, Jackson made about $115,000, according to income tax
returns that he released during his 1984 presidential campaign. Of
that 1983 income, Jackson earned $37,342 in speaking honoraria.
   Jackson has parlayed his charismatic style into a prominent
source of income on the lecture circuit since his 1984 campaign,
according to his financial disclosure statement filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   In August 1984, he started Personalities International Inc., a
company run out of his Chicago home, to receive his speaking fees
and other income, according to his attorney, John Bustamante.
   Jackson was paid $192,090 by Personaliministration simply doesn't want
a trade bill, that's
the long and the short of it,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., declared. ``Now the president can run but he can't
hide. He's going to get a bill.''
   Senate passage of the bill produced by a House-Senate conference
committee was a foregone conclusion. The question was whether
Democrats could win the two-thirds support needed to override the
threatened veto. But there also was a question of whether that
margin would hold up during a future vote to override President
Reagan's veto.
   The administration and the Democratic leadership went down to
the wire with lobbying efforts, but the race appeared too close to
call, lawmakers said.
   Reagan renewed his veto threat and promised to work later for a
milder version in a letter Tuesday to Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
   Reagan called on lawmakers to ``finish the trade bill process in
a way that serves America's interests _ not the special interests.''
   Most administration fire has been directed at a provision that
would require all but the smallest companies to provide their
employees with 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., defended the embattled
plant-closings provision, saying 40,000 plants have shut down in
this decade of increased foreign competition.
   ``Nearly 2 million people have lost their jobs each year,''
Kennedy said. ``Yet the administration does not want workers to
know their jobs are in danger and to have time to plan for new ways
to provide for their families.''
   The administration dangled the prospect of a slimmed down
version of the bill, minus the plant-closings and perhaps other
provisions, once Congress has sustained Reagan's expected veto of
the current measure.
   But Democratic leaders said this could be the last chance to
support trade legislation before the fall election campaign.
   The House passed the bill last Thursday, 312-107, more than
enough to override a veto.
   The bill would overhaul the system under which the United States
imposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate against
international trade violations and other unfair practices.
   Authority to retaliate would be transferred from the president
to the U.S. trade representative. Retaliation would be mandatory
but the bill provides five broadly phrased exceptions, such as
threats to national security.
   Main provisions also streamline the means by which the United
States imposes import restrictions to protect American businesses
threatened by surges in import competition.
   But the 1,000-page measure contains hundreds of additional
provisions, ranging from billions of dollars in agricultural
subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.
   Government aid to workers left jobless by import competition
would be expanded. Trade sanctions would be imposed on Japan's
Toshiba Corp., one of its subsidiaries and the Norwegian company of
Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk for sale of submarine silencing equipment to
the Soviet Union.
   The measure would assist Americans in defending themselves
against bribery charges brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
act because of payments made by their agents overseas. It would
ease some export curbs on high-tech equipment subject to
restriction because of its potential military uses.
   A maze of minor provisions governs trade in everything from
cranberries to canteloupes.
   Democratic leaders gave up efforts Wednesday to win support from
Alaska's Republican senators by unsnarling a dispute over the
measure's curbs on export of North Slope oil. Byrd said attempts to
resolve the matter ran into procedural roadblocks.
   Several Republicans have expressed irritation at the
administration's heavy focus on the plant-closings provision as the
reason to oppose the bill.
   ``Frankly, some of us think there ought to be a stronger
reason,'' Dole told reporters Wednesday. ``It puts Republicans on
the side, at least the perception out there, of being against the
poor working man and women who get only four-day notice.''
   The administration, supported by a number of business groups,
has been contending that the measure would actually blunt the
nation's trade competitive edge rather than sharpen it.

   Movies, the wags once said, killed vaudeville.
Will ``Dirty Dancing'' bring vaudeville back?
   Promoters of the Dirty Dancing Concert Tour hope it will. A
company of dancers and rockers, including Eric Carmen and Grammy
winner Bill Medley, will bump and grind their way through 120
cities, starting May 29 at the Concord Hotel in the Catskill
Mountains, where part of the movie was shot.
   ``Dirty Dancing,'' set in 1963, has become a national
phenomenon. Many fans have seen the picture more than a dozen times
and have worn out their tapedecks playing the hit soundtrack.
   The movie also has sparked a new interest in social dancing with
classes specializing in the steps of the '60s _ the jerk, the
mashed potato, the bump, Latin dances, the monkey _ popping up all
over the country.
   Even Barbara Walters has gotten into the ``Dirty Dancing'' craze
and will twirl a step or two with the movie's co-star, Patrick
Swayze, when she interviews him on her next interview special, on
ABC on May 11.
   Though the movie has a limp plot with little more to distinguish
it than a hot soundtrack of '60s music and some occasional sexy
dancing, it has grossed more than $140 million worldwide, the album
has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide and more than
400,000 videocassettes of the movie are in circulation.
   Michael Omansky, vice president for marketing of RCA Records,
said the soundtrack has sold 7 million copies in the United States
and ``More Dirty Dancing'' _ songs that didn't get on the first LP
_ has sold 2 million. Forty-four percent of those buying the album
are 24 to 44 years old.
   ``(I've Had) the Time of My Life,'' the duet performed in the
movie by Medley and Jennifer Warnes, won a Grammy award for best
duet and an Academy Award for best movie song.
   ``In eight months the American public has spent over a quarter
of a billion dollars on the `Dirty Dancing' phenomenon,'' said Jon
Peisinger, president of Vestron Video.
   The tour will have eight dancers, including two who appeared in
the movie, as well as Medley, Carmen, Merry Clayton and the
Contours. It was conceived by David Fishof, who produced the
Monkees reunion tour in 1986.
   Tickets for the June 14-16 performances at the 6,000-seat Radio
City Music Hall went on sale April 20 and sold out in 24 hours. Two
extra dates were added.
   Medley's biggest hit record was ``You've Lost That Lovin'
Feelin''' with Bobby Hatfield as the Righteous Brothers' in 1964.
During a recent rehearsal at Radio City, he said he first turned
down singing in the movie because his wife was pregnant and he
didn't want to leave her.
   When the baby, a girl, was born, he told his wife, ```I'll be
right back. I'm just going to record a song.' Two weeks ago I told
her, `I'm going out on tour. I'll be right back.''' He also has a
22-year-old son.
   He showed his daughter's picture to Clayton, who sings ``Yes''
in the film. The singer, who had a hit duet, ``You're the Reason
I'm Livin','' with Bobby Darin in 1963, said, ``I've got a boy and
girl, too. They're like old people. My son played my son in `Made
to Order.'''
   Joe Billingsley, an original member of the Contours said that
when he first heard about doing ``Dirty Dancing'' he thought it was
an X-rated movie. The Contours formed in 1959 and had its biggest
hit, ``Do You Love Me?'' in 1962. The song is heard in ``Dirty
Dancing.''
   Carmen sings ``Hungry Eyes'' in ``Dirty Dancing'' when Swayze
starts to teach Jennifer Grey how to dance. Carmen started in
Cleveland in the early '70s with the Raspberries, who did
``Overnight Sensation.'' He went solo in 1975 after the group split.
   ``I think it would have taken something like this to get me on
the road again, something I haven't done in 10 years,'' he said.
   Both ``(I've Had) the Time of My Life'' and ``Hungry Eyes'' were
written by John DeNicola and Franke Previte, who were in a group
called Franke and the Knockouts. They're now writing songs for an
upcoming album by Swayze.
   The movie also uses '60s music by the Four Seasons, Otis
Redding, the Zodiacs, the Surfaris, the Drifters, the Shirelles,
Mickey and Sylvia and the Five Satins.
   Dorian Sanchez, a dancer in the movie, was also assistant to
choreographer Kenny Ortega. She's choreographing some additional
dances for the tour, which requires more group dancing than the
movie did.
   Before leading a demonstration with her assistant, Bubba Carr,
Sanchez said, ``Kenny Ortega wanted to start a dance craze that
would sweep the nation. I want everybody to leave the tour arenas
dirty dancing all the way home.
   ``We do the grind, incorporating the pony, jerk and monkey. The
structure is based within the mambo.''
   M.R. Fletcher, who was Sanchez's partner in the film, is Karen
Getz's partner on tour. Getz said she got into the movie by a
``word-of-mouth audition.''
   ``The audition I went to was kind of small, about 100 dancers,''
she said. ``There were quite a few agent submissions, too, and
auditions in Los Angeles. I found out I got it about a month later.
I was very excited, putting it mildly. We shot in North Carolina
and Virginia.''
   Dancer Greg Ramos said the show isn't typical disco dancing _
not ``Saturday Night Fever'' redux.
   ``There's a lot of partner work in it. It appears to be a lot
more sensual than your basic jazz or disco dancing. This is a lot
more intimate. You concentrate on your partner,'' he said.
   Said Clayton: ``I'm going to have the time of my life. I want to
sing with Bill.''
   In his deep bass voice, Medley replied, ``Yes'' _ the title of
her song in the movie.

   A little more than a year ago, in the
darkest days of winter, Laura Lynn Lazarovich lay in a hospital bed
fighting for life.
   Her skull was fractured, her right side paralyzed, her right arm
and collarbone snapped like twigs. Two front teeth had been gouged
out, both her hazel eyes were swollen shut, dried blood caked her
lips, and her body was mottled with bruises from forehead to ankles.
   A monitor watched over her heart. Intravenous tubes sprouted
from her pitifully broken body.
   Laura Lynn was 2{ years old.
   Prosecutors say her tormentors were her parents.
   Moreover, this was the child's third fractured skull in 28
months. Laura Lynn was a double victim, not only of especially
brutal beatings, but also of a bureaucratic bungle that returned
her home for the last, almost fatal attack.
   Even as assault charges were pending in New Jersey against her
parents, Roger and Janice Lazarovich, a Family Court judge there
had ordered her returned from the temporary custody of her maternal
grandparents to the Lazaroviches in Massachusetts.
   Now the law has caught up with the Lazaroviches, who had Laura
Lynn and two sons over three years, moved three times from three
states and were divorced in February.
   Today, both are in jail: Lazarovich, 25, is serving 15-20 years
after his conviction for mayhem and assault; his 23-year-old wife,
who had been scheduled to stand trial on the same charges May 2,
won a delay last week and will be tried in September.
   Superior Court Judge Charles Alberti, with 16 years on the
bench, said in sentencing Laura Lynn's father, ``I don't know if
I've dealt with a case, by virtue of this child's tender years,
where the child has been more brutalized.''
   The two still face extradition to New Jersey on two counts of
aggravated assault, according to Camden County prosecutor Sam
Asbell.
   The Lazaroviches drove 20 miles through heavy snow that
Saturday, Jan. 24, 1987, to bring their unconscious daughter from
their western Massachusetts trailer home to a Pittsfield hospital.
They said she had ``fallen off her potty seat,'' according to court
papers.
   But prosecutors said she had been beaten for more than a week.
Court papers said she was bitten, choked and her head slammed
repeatedly into a countertop from about Jan. 16 to Jan. 24.
   Laura Lynn's maternal grandmother, Pamela Christopher, could not
recognize the battered child when she visited her in the hospital
several days later. ``She didn't look like the little girl who had
left us,'' recalled Mrs. Christopher, who with her husband, Arthur,
had cared for the girl about a year.
   Mrs. Christopher asked if she could hold her, thinking it might
be for the last time. ``I questioned whether she would live,'' she
recalled. ``They had to prop her up to put her in my lap.''
   Laura Lynn spent eight months in the hospital and a Boston
rehabilitation center. Upon her release in September, the courts
granted the Massachusetts Department of Social Services temporary
custody of the girl and her brothers, Anthony, 2{, and Timothy, 1{.
   Laura Lynn was placed in a foster home in western Massachusetts.
Her brothers are together in another home in the same region. The
Lazaroviches have not been granted visitation rights and say they
do not know their childen's whereabouts. No allegation of abuse of
the boys was ever raised.
   ``Laura Lynn is doing remarkably well,'' said Joseph Landolfi, a
spokesman for the social service department. ``The boys are in very
good shape.''
   Medical experts testified that Laura Lynn suffered permanent
damage in the beating, including partial paralysis of her right arm
and loss of peripheral vision in her left eye.
   After her release from the hospital, she began showing signs of
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which is most commonly seen among
combat veterans who relive war experiences and exhibit anxiety,
irritability and rage.
   In Laura Lynn's case, she took to hitting, kicking and biting
her foster parents. In court records, a psychologist who treated
Laura Lynn last December quoted the child as saying: ``I don't like
Mummy. Mummy hurts me. Mummy pinches me and kicks me and hits the
wall with me.'' Of her father, she was quoted as saying, ``Where's
my very bad Daddy?''
   Cynthia Monahon, the psychologist, said Laura Lynn's recovery
from injury has been encouraging and she has made unexpectedly
rapid developmental gains because of her resilience and
extraordinary care by her foster parents. She said Laura Lynn is
severely traumatized and has just begun to deal with the
psychological impact of her abuse.
   ``While she has formed solid attachments in her new family and
takes enormous pleasure in her new life, Laura remains an anxious,
demanding and, at times, oppositional little girl whose functioning
ranges from 2-to-2{ years of age,'' the psychologist wrote. Laura
Lynn will be 4 on Aug. 19.
   Roger and Janice Lazarovich were each adopted at the age of 20
months, Roger by John and Marilyn Lazarovich of Norwood, Mass.,
south of Boston, and Janice by the Christophers who live near
Camden, N.J., across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Both
were bright, but few other childhood similarities exist. The
Christophers considered their daughter's marriage a mismatch.
   Both Roger and social workers describe his childhood as
tumultuous: He was given to exchanging blows and insults with his
mother, petty thefts and setting fires at home and at school.

   He was locked in his room at night to keep him from stealing,
ran away from home, became a ward of the state and went through
half a dozen foster homes. He was sent to a juvenile center,
dropped out of high school, joined the Navy when he was 18, served
only seven months and found work pumping gas and fixing cars.
   ``I was not the most gregarious foster child, disobeying the
household rules or not getting along as well as expected or
demanded,'' he said in an interview.
   Mrs. Lazarovich declined to be interviewed, but a New Jersey
social worker wrote in a January 1986 background report that she
was raised by a strong, assertive mother and successful businessman
father.
   ``According to Janice,'' the report said, ``she was taught to be
seen and not heard, kept in a state of dependency and not allowed
to grow up. Although Jan speaks very intelligently, she ...
exhibits very little emotion.''
   According to another report, from a Massachusetts social worker,
``Janice tends to hold things in and then explode.''
   Janice was the first of three adopted children. The Christophers
also adopted a Korean boy, Scott, who will graduate from the U.S.
Naval Academy this year, and his older sister, Holly. Lazarovich
said his wife had felt that Holly, two years her senior, got
special treatment.
   ``Jan admitted that when you go from being the only child to the
middle of three, there are some problems,'' Arthur Christopher said
in an interview. ``But she didn't have any outstanding problems,
and she loves both Holly and Scott. In fact, she was the big wheel.
She was their translator. They arrived here neither one of them
speaking English.''
   Roger and Janice met in the fall of 1983 while she was a
freshman at Wheelock College and dating a friend of his. They
married little more than a month later, on Nov. 29, 1983. Janice,
18 and already pregnant with Laura Lynn, was planning a career in
child and family services when she dropped out in her first
semester to marry Roger, then 20.
   ``We saw a lot of ourselves in each other,'' Lazarovich said.
``Janice wasn't happy with her past. I wasn't happy with my past.
We probably felt sorry for each other. It was a marriage of pity.''
   Almost from birth, Laura Lynn was a tragic figure. Her skull was
fractured the first time Sept. 22, 1984, when she was 5 weeks old
and the Lazaroviches were renting an apartment in Winslow Township,
N.J., said Asbell, the Camden County prosecutor.
   Four weeks later, on Oct. 19, authorities determined her skull
had been fractured a second time and that her left leg was broken.
The state placed Laura Lynn in a foster home.
   Some experts familiar with the case said they believed she
suffered some developmental delay. She received therapy at a
Haddonfield, N.J., learning center until the summer of 1985, by
which time she had been placed with her maternal grandparents.
   Criminal charges of aggravated assault and endangering the
welfare of a child were filed against the Lazaroviches on July 12,
1985. But the couple had already fled New Jersey, leaving Laura
Lynn behind, moving first to Ossipee, N.H., then to Foxboro, Mass.,
then to Plainfield, Mass.
   ``We ran away,'' Lazarovich said. ``The excuse (from the
landlord) was we weren't getting along with our neighbors, and we
got an eviction notice. It seemed to be fallout from what happened
with Laura. Word seems to travel pretty quick, and undesirables are
undesirables no matter how you look at it.''
   Nine months later, on April 9, 1986, with sufficient evidence in
hand, the New Jersey grand jury finally indicted the couple, whose
whereabouts, nevertheless, remained unknown. When the Lazaroviches
failed to appear for their arraignment May 15, authorities issued
fugitive arrest warrants.
   Three weeks earlier, however, Judge Robert Gladden of Camden
County Family Court had already ruled that Laura Lynn could live
with her parents in Massachusetts, although New Jersey would retain
official custody. The hearing was held with the consent of the New
Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services but without the
knowledge of Asbell, the prosecutor.
   Laura Lynn was sent to Massachusetts, but Mrs. Lazarovich had
difficulty loving Laura Lynn after the 18-month separation,
according to a social worker's report. The parents compared her to
her brother, Tony, and were much prouder of the boy, the report
said; Laura Lynn was jealous.
   Asbell acknowledged the case fell through the cracks,
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``It was one of those situations where
the right hand and the left hand are not working together. When the
judge had a hearing, the Division of Youth and Family Services
never notified us. The judge also did not have the benefit of our
investigation, so he granted the return of the child. That has
subsequently been corrected so that there should be no
communication screwups anymore.''
   Lazarovich, who maintains he is innocent, says something
positive has to come out of the tragedy.
   ``Child abuse is a cycle,'' he said. ``Abused children become
abusive parents and the cycle continues. I don't want to read
someday about a Laura Lynn Smith, or whatever her last name is
going to be, up on charges of mayhem herself.''

   The last big trouble at the normally tranquil
Bowen Homes housing project in northwest Atlanta came in 1981, when
a day-care center's boiler exploded and so did angry parents and
other residents.
   So when a rock- and bottle-throwing melee broke out among people
gathered to watch a run-of-the-mill traffic arrest March 30, City
Hall knew something was very wrong.
   At least four people, all black, in Atlanta's poorer
neighborhoods have been shot to death by police in eight months,
prompting accusations of excessive, deadly force.
   Residents already afraid of drug-related violence are now
growing fearful of a police force that is also trying to fight more
crime with fewer officers. Some predict the resentment that's
simmered for years in poor, mostly black sections is about to boil
over.
   Fueling the fire is the fact that although the police force and
government of this shiny Southern city are controlled by blacks,
there have been few prosecutions and no convictions in these
incidents.
   ``Atlanta's gonna explode,'' said City Council member Hosea
Williams, who has worked with the families and neighbors of police
shooting victims. ``It's bad out there right now with police. It's
explosive.
   ``These people are talking about getting their guns out,''
Williams said. ``They've started ignoring me, cursing me, calling
me an Uncle Tom. They say, `We don't care _ they're killing us
anyhow.'''
   Tensions between blacks and police have risen this year
elsewhere, too.
   In Dallas, a homeless, mentally ill man shot a police officer to
death with his own service revolver and later was killed by police.
In Los Angeles, blacks living amid gang violence complained that
police took no strong action against the gangs until a suburban
woman was killed.
   In the last six weeks in Atlanta, police cars were pelted with
rocks and broken bottles in two housing projects, and Mayor Andrew
Young was berated at two community meetings for neglecting the
city's disadvantaged.
   Public Safety Commissioner George Napper asserted that reports
of growing dissatisfaction with police are rumors spread by drug
dealers who want anti-police sentiment at a pitch so drug traffic
can thrive.
   ``It ends up with us right in the middle of a situation that we
didn't create,'' Napper said in an interview. ``What you've got is
so many damned drugs out there in the street that it's a moral
shame.''
   ``They're not doing anything but trying to use the drugs as a
cover-up,'' Williams said. ``It's a shame that we have a police
department like we do here.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, says he is not surprised when residents in
poorer neighborhoods vent frustrations on police. ``There have been
too many instances where the same officers are involved in
disrespect and abuse,'' he said.
   He said his office tries to keep lists of officers whose names
surface repeatedly in reports of excessive force against blacks,
but receives little cooperation from the police department.
   One case of multiple offenses involved Officer Ridley Watson,
who was fired last month after Napper cited eight to 10 excessive
force complaints filed against him.
   Watson was one of two officers involved in the Sept. 10 shooting
death of Eddie Lee Callahan in Atlanta's Carver Homes housing
project. Callahan, who was black, was shot six times in the back
and side at point-blank range as he struggled with Watson over his
gun. Watson and his partner, both white, were trying to arrest
Callahan on suspicion of car theft.
   Napper declined to comment in detail about Watson's case, which
is being appealed to the city's Civil Service Board. His office
would not be more specific about the number of complaints against
Watson.
   ``They are trying to establish a fact in the minds of young
blacks _ `If we try to apprehend you, and you resist or run, we are
going to shoot and kill you,''' Williams said. ``And the police are
killing young black males, who are already the most repressed
individuals in our society, in a city that is controlled by
blacks.''
   Young received a 90-minute tongue-lashing from Carver Homes
residents about safety and housing issues in April when he visited
there for what was supposed to be an anti-drug pep talk with
children.
   He was on the receiving end of a similar attack at a meeting in
the Poole Creek neighborhood, where Baxter Lee Williams, 23, was
shot to death by police Feb. 27. Police say Williams pulled a
pistol, but no weapon was confiscated; witnesses said Williams was
holding a beer can.
   ``When you see people attacking the mayor like that, they have
completely lost faith in the police department,'' Williams said.
``Everybody know ain't nobody gonna draw no beer can on no police.
So the police know they can kill a black man and not get indicted
for it.''
   Napper, however, strongly disagreed: ``There's not one shred of
evidence to suggest that people who are involved in any of the
situations with the police was not doing anything. They were doing
something. If there's any evidence to indicate that officers were
just thumping on people for no reason at all, then there's no room
in this police bureau for that kind of behavior, or for those kind
of officers.''
   Mary Sanford, president of the tenants' association of Perry
Homes, a northwest Atlanta housing project that was rocked three
years ago when a resident died while in police custody, said while
relations with police in her community are not perfect, there is
not a lot of resentment.
   ``There's a percentage that's anti-police, about 2 or 3
percent,'' she said. Most of the people who commit crimes at Perry
Homes are not residents, she said.
   Napper said police plan to address community concerns in much
the same manner as they always have _ with more meetings, scheduled
to start this month. Officers recently began a crackdown on drug
activity in Atlanta's housing projects.
   Bowen Homes resident Brenda Weems said she wasn't sure Napper's
planned meetings would be effective, since people in her
neighborhood do not cooperate with police.
   ``I see (police officers) out here. I see them at night most of
the time, and if you call them, they usually come,'' she said.
``They just have to have some cooperation, and I don't think they
are going to get that out here.''

<TEXT>
   The government says the economy's 2.3 percent annual growth rate
in the first three months of 1988 should erase lingering
predictions of a post-crash recession, but financial markets
apparently aren't convinced this is good news.
   Strong spending by American consumers, a surge in business
investment and growing exports kept the gross national product
rising despite declines in government spending and a housing
construction slump, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
   It was the government's first look at overall economic
performance this year, and was widely anticipated because of
earlier fears that the October stock market crash portended a
severe economic slowdown.
   ``So much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the
first quarter,'' said Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner. ``...
Whatever the impact (of the crash) was, it's pretty much behind
us.''
   The GNP report substantiated other signs of strength that had
accumulated through the quarter, notably higher rates of
employment, factory production and exports of manufactured goods.
   Beryl Sprinkel, President Reagan's chief economic adviser, told
a White House briefing on the GNP report that ``the economy is on
track for moderate further expansion and for restrained inflation
in 1988.''
   But financial markets showed little enthusiasm for the GNP
report, partly because it did not alleviate fears that the economy
might be growing too rapidly. In the view of investors in stocks
and bonds, this means inflation is still a potential threat and
could mean higher interest rates later this year.
   In the bond market, a key barometer of the direction in interest
rates, there was only mild reaction to the GNP number. The price of
the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged, and its yield, which moves
inversely to price, stayed at 9 percent.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials crept up
8.79 points to 2,044.76 in light trading. In foreign exchange
dealings, the dollar was mixed.
   The administration, which is looking for a sixth straight year
of economic growth to boost chances for a Republican presidential
win in November, has forecast that GNP will grow 2.9 percent for
the full year.
   In another report, the government said that after-tax corporate
profits rose 2.6 percent in the final three months of 1987. This
was an upward revision from a month ago, when the government had
calculated a 1.6 percent increase.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Drift Higher As OPEC Meeting Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technical factors and talk of possible output
cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC producers have boosted oil futures prices.
   Contracts for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, settled at $18.60 per barrel, up 20 cents
from Monday's close on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among May contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded
gasoline closed at 52.42 cents per gallon, up 0.37 cent, while
wholesale heating oil settled 0.83 cent higher, at 52.04 cents per
gallon.
   The move up stemmed mainly from technical factors, according to
Chris McCormack, an analyst at the Drexel Burham Lambert Inc.
securities firm.
   He said trading was apathetic until the crude contract drifted
higher than the market expected, at which point buyers stepped in.
   Traders also nervously were watching meetings in Vienna,
Austria, between officials of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and rival producers over ways of tightening
world supplies to boost prices.
   Buying increased somewhat after word hit the market that seven
independent oil-producing nations had decided to offer OPEC a 5
percent cut in their oil exports as a gesture of support, McCormack
said.
   A 5 percent cut for all independent producers would amount to a
reduction in exports of roughly 200,000 barrels a day.
   Production cuts, if implemented, would be expected to push up
oil prices, at least temporarily, by bringing supplies closer in
line with demand.
   The two sides consisted of OPEC's price monitoring committee,
comprised of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia,
Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria, and representatives from non-cartel
producers Mexico, Colombia, Egypt, Angola, Oman, Malaysia, Brunei
and China.
   The price committee was to present the proposal to the full,
13-member OPEC at a meeting Thursday in Vienna.

   The Associated Press reported incorrect figures
Monday for the closing Dow Jones averages of 30 industrial stocks,
20 transportation stocks and the composite of 65 stocks. The
averages were incorrect because prices of two component stocks,
Coca-Cola Co. and USAir Group Inc., were wrong.
   The closing Dow Jones 30 should have been 2,035.97, up 20.88.
The Dow Jones transportation average should have been 853.35, up
5.68, and the composite of 65 stocks should have been 758.21, up
6.14.
   The problem with the Dow Jones industrial average was that the
New York Stock Exchange reported a trade of 1,000 shares of Coca
Cola at a price of 39, then erroneously corrected that to make the
price 39~. The actual price was 38~. But the NYSE's data-processing
subsidiary has no way to correct a correction automatically. The
correction was made manually, which was not read by the AP computer
that produces the stock lists and computes the Dow Jones averages.
   The incorrect price of 39~ was used in figuring the Dow
industrial average, which caused it and the composite 65 to be
wrong.
   In the other error, the NYSE corrected a price of 33~ for USAir
to put the trade into proper sequence. That trade occurred at 4:02
p.m. A trade of 34 a share took place two minutes later, and, in
fact, was the final trade of the day. But the AP computer read the
33~ price as the last and that was used in figuring the Dow Jones
transportation average and the composite 65.

   When Evan Andrews fell in love with
business-school classmate Jesse Moore, he didn't discover until
later that she was an illegal inside trader. What's worse, she got
her illicit stock tips from his future boss.
   ``Can't you make an honest living?,'' he asked in a
confrontation. She replied: ``You know that this kind of thing goes
on all the time.''
   The fictional characters' conflict is the subject of ``Legal
Tender,'' a new 20-minute color video to be used in ethics classes
at the Stanford University graduate business school and possibly
other schools.
   ``It's something that really hits home,'' said Stanford student
Alan Jacobs, who conceived and produced the film. It features
professional actors and cost $40,000 to make, with most of the
money donated by corporate sponsors.
   Jacobs showed the video to a recent conference of graduate
business students at Northwestern University and got an
enthusiastic response.
   He said ethics professors at several other institutions have
expressed strong interest in getting copies, partly because they
have little material for teaching business ethics, a rapidly
growing part of many MBA programs.
   ``Virtually all the existing material is in the form of written
cases,'' Jacobs, 29, said in an interview. ``They are good at
providing the student with a wealth of detail about situations.
What they're weaker at is conveying the emotion and pressure and
confusion that goes with the situations.''
   Thomas L. Dunfee, an ethics professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton business school, said Jacobs' project was
part of a broader trend toward using video to dramatize ethical
issues for student discussion. Wharton and Harvard Business School
also have undertaken such projects, he said.
   ``I think that is a provocative way to do it. I certainly will
take a look at the one produced at Stanford to see if it will work
here,'' Dunfee said. ``I think as part of a package it makes sense
to show these kinds of things.''
   James Kuhn, a Columbia business school professor who specializes
in ethical issues, said he had talked with Jacobs and also was
impressed with the questions raised by the video story.
   The problem raised in ``Legal Tender'' is left unresolved
intentionally to provoke class discussion about whether the
fictional Andrews should leave his girlfriend, squeal on his
prospective employer or keep quiet. Whether she is willing to
change also deliberately is left vague.
   Jacobs, who wants to get into the film business when he
graduates, said he devised the plot last year for a class
assignment that asked students to describe an ethical dilemma in
business. He borrowed from events that range from the Wall Street
insider trading scandal to company whistleblowers who've been
fired, and thought putting it on film was the natural next step.
   Jacobs even used a line that was once attributed to Dennis
Levine, the former investment banker whose insider trading
violations spawned the scandal nearly two years ago: ``When you
work in a deli, you take home pastrami.''
   Shot mostly on Stanford's campus, the cast is a mix of business
students and professionals, including a paid director,
cinematographer and the main characters, who are portrayed as
attractive, intelligent and ambitious.
   ``In order to really care about a situation, you really have to
care about the people involved,'' Jacobs said. ``What I think we
were able to accomplish is to get the students involved enough in
the characters so they can see themselves.''
   Jacobs said he might sell ``Legal Tender'' for a small fee to
get wider distribution but doesn't intend to profit from the film.

   Walt Disney Co.'s second quarter profit
rose by 32 percent over last year, powered by a continuing string
of hit movies and strong business at its theme parks, the company
said Tuesday.
   Disney announced that net earnings for the second quarter of its
1988 fiscal year were $120.1 million, or 87 cents a share, up from
$91.2 million, or 66 cents a share, for the same period in 1987.
   Revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was $774.5 million, up
from $706.1 million the year before.
   Disney's Touchstone film production subsidiary has churned out a
series of successful movies, including in the most recent quarter,
the smash hits ``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Good Morning,
Vietnam.'' The Disney classic, ``The Fox and the Hound,'' was
successful in an Easter re-release.
   Revenue from films rose 12 percent in the quarter, theme parks
and restaurants notched a 6 percent increase and sales for the new
consumer products segment rose 36 percent.
   For the first half of Disney's fiscal year profit rose 22
percent to $220.6 million, or $1.61 per share, from $181.1 million,
or $1.32 per share, in the first half of 1987. Revenue in the first
six months was $1.51 billion, up from $1.37 billion the previous
year.
   Results for the second quarter of 1987 were restated to reflect
the sale of Arvida Corp., a housing developer in Boca Raton, Fla.

requirements with fewer workers.''
   The privately held company reportedly earned $135 million in the
year ended Nov. 30, compared with $49 million in the previous
fiscal year.
   The company said the layoffs will affect mostly night-shift
workers. It also announced shorter work weeks during May for other
El Paso workers and shorter weeks indefinitely for remaining
workers in North Carolina.

<HEAD>To Taxpayers, Milestones Look Like Millstones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple of milestones on the current calendar
seem likely to pass without much celebration among American
taxpayers.
   One is the 75th anniversary of the federal income tax, which was
created in 1913 by the 16th Amendment to the Constitution.
   The other is ``tax freedom day,'' a calculation created and
popularized by the Tax Foundation, a non-profit research
organization in Washington.
   According to the foundation's economists, this year ``the
average American would work from Jan. 1 through May 4 to furnish
federal, state and local tax collectors with the funds to pay all
taxes, if every cent earned from the first of the year went for
taxes.
   ``On May 5, Americans finally start working for themselves.''
   As it happens, May 5 is the latest date for ``tax freedom day''
since people began keeping records on this sort of thing. Counting
the extra day in February that comes in a leap year, it extends two
days past 1987's May 4.
   Not all the tax money comes directly out of consumer's
pocketbooks or paychecks. Half the Social Security tax, for
example, is nominally paid by employers rather than employees.
   But the Tax Foundation counts the full amount, reasoning that
``sooner or later, the American `worker' ultimately pays the total
tax burden _ including business taxes which are passed on to
individuals _ in his or her capacity as an employee, proprietor or
investor.''
   Psychologically, the timing of tax freedom day 1988 is
unfortunate, coming just on the heels of the unpleasant surprises
many people got in April as they settled their accounts with Uncle
Sam for 1987.
   When he saw the bottom line on his return, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr.,
a professional financial analyst, recalls thinking: ``This can't be
right. We were supposed to have reform!''
   Many commentators see a special irony in the Tax Foundation's
computations for 1988, the last of the eight-year presidency of
Ronald Reagan. After all, Reagan came to office on a wave of
tax-cutting hopes and promises.
   But as the foundation notes, the tax reductions of 1981 have
been steadily whittled away by a parade of subsequent changes.
   It observed, ``The U.S. taxpayer has now lost all the ground
gained through the major cuts of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of
1981.''
   With subsequent rule changes and increases in Social Security
taxes, it says, ``like the Cheshire cat in `Alice in Wonderland,'
nothing remains but the smile.''
   The frustration, of course, is compounded by the realization
that the tax payments being made do not come close to covering the
cost of government, as reflected in the budget deficit.
   Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of a mutual-fund advisory letter,
suggests that beyond what you have paid, ``You owe the Treasury
$18,569.10. That's every taxpayer's portion of the national debt.''
   Forecasts abound of further moves to increase federal taxes in
the next year or two as the government struggles to get the budget
under control.
   If the tax burden is mounting, that would seem to put added
emphasis on careful tax planning for those on whom it falls. But,
again thanks to tax reform, some of the familiar tools used in that
planning are no longer of much use.
   When the accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath examined a
sampling of 1987 returns it prepared for clients in four large
cities, it found that less than 5 percent made contributions to
individual retirement accounts.
   The tax deduction for those contributions has been reduced or
eliminated for many middle- to upper-income taxpayers.
   All this is enough to prompt observers like DeVoe and Jacobs to
take a nostalgic look back at the first year of the income tax,

   The stock market edged upward in quiet trading
today, continuing its recent tentative advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.49 to 2,047.25 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in the overall tally

   The Commerce Department said the gross national product expanded
at a 2.3 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in
the first quarter of the year.
   Still, brokers said traders remained highly sensitive to the
recent volatility of stock prices, warily watching the ups and
downs of stock-index futures for swings that might touch off a
round of program trading activity.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, up ~ at 47|;

   The yen's sharp rise against the dollar and a soft
American market cut into the number of Japanese automobiles
exported to the United States and pushed Japan's total car exports
down for a second consecutive year, an official said Wednesday.
   Toshiharu Nishimasu of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association said Japan exported 6.27 million cars during the fiscal
year ended March 31, down 4.9 percent from the previous year.
   He said it was the second consecutive year that automobile
exports had declined.
   Exports to the United States, Japan's major car importer, fell
by 11.3 percent from a year earlier to 3,011,514 vehicles, he said.
That included 2,214,149 passenger cars, down 3.7 percent from
fiscal 1986; 797,361 trucks, down 27.1 percent; and four buses, up
from none the previous year.
   Japan had voluntarily set a limit of 2.3 million passenger cars
for export to the United States during fiscal 1987, Nishimasu said.
   In addition to slump in the U.S. car market, the yen's rise
against the dollar made Japanese car more expensive in the United
States, Nishimasu said.
   Exports to Europe totaled 1.63 million cars, down 0.7 percent
from the previous fical year. Car exports to Southeast Asia totaled
477,780, up 10.0 percent; while car exports to the Middle East
jumped 29.7 percent to 221,890, the official said.

   Du Pont Co. said Wednesday its
first-quarter profit rose 51 percent on a 12 percent sales increase
and some onetime gains.
   The company attributed the gains to cost-cutting and improved
sales of agricultural and industrial chemicals, coal, petroleum and
polymers.
   It reported a profit of $590 million, or $2.45 a share, compared
with earnings of $391 million, or $1.62 a share, a year ago.
   Sales for the quarter rose to $8 billion from $7.1 billion in
1987.
   The latest results includes non-recurring gains of $40 million
resulting from the settlement of litigation, the sale of technology
and the sale of its U.S. and Canadian explosives business.
   ``The solid gain in first-quarter performance reflects continued
strong worldwide demand and further progress in reducing costs and
improving overall efficiency,'' said Chairman Richard E. Heckert.
   The earnings were released as the company convened for its
annual shareholders meeting.
   Before the meeting started at a downtown hotel, police reported
they arrested four people at the Du Pont headquarters building
after two of them unfurled a banner down the side of the building
calling for the prevention rather than incineration of toxic waste.

<HEAD>Democrats Hunt Trade Bill Votes From Angry Alaskans</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate pushed toward a vote on sweeping
trade legislation today with Democrats saying there was no way to
unsnarl a dispute over the measure's restrictions on Alaskan oil
exports.
   With the bill poised for a final vote and no unanimous agreement
on a solution in sight, there appeared no choice except to go ahead
without a resolution, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., told
a news briefing.
   In that case, the bill would be voted on with the Alaskan
provision included. The lingering dispute threatened to deny the
votes of Alaska's Republican senators to supporters of the
legislation who hoped to roll up a big enough victory margin to
make President Reagan think again before reaching for his veto
pencil.
   Passage was expected, but Democrats said they needed 14
Republican votes to demonstrate the two-thirds support required to
override a presidential veto.
   No hard counts were available but lawmakers were universal in
saying that whichever side prevailed would have few if any votes to
spare.
   Byrd also said lawmakers were deceiving themselves if they were
certain that once Reagan made good on his repeated veto threats
there would be quick passage of a streamlined version, minus the
most controversial features.
   ``Another bill is not wired and those who are gambling on that
are gambling on a weak reed,'' Byrd said.
   Reagan renewed the veto threat Tuesday, calling on lawmakers in
a letter to Dole to ``finish the trade bill process in a way that
serves America's interests _ not the special interests.''
   Meanwhile, Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., told reporters he
will continue to fight the bill but believes the president should
have a stronger reason for his threatened veto than its requirement
that business provide notice to employees of plant closings and
major layoffs.
   ``It puts Republicans on the side, at least the perception out
there, of being against the poor working man and women who get four
days' notice,'' Dole told reporters a few minutes before the Senate
resumed debate.
   The legislation produced by a House-Senate conference committee
has been under debate in the Senate since Friday. The Alaska
dispute surfaced Monday as a final critical stumbling block.
   ``This legislation discriminates very violently against my
state,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, declared. Sen. Frank
Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said he was incensed over oil provisions
affecting his state.
   It is currently illegal to export any oil from the Alaska oil
pipeline, although the state does export some 4,000 barrels a day
from Cook Inlet.
   The bill would limit export of oil from new refineries to 70,000
barrels a day and 50 percent of output. Thus far there is only one
new refinery in Alaska, at the port of Valdez.
   The bill also would permit export to Canada of 50,000 barrels of
crude a day but require first sending the oil aboard American
vessels for a stopoff at a U.S. port, presumably Seattle, before it
went back north of the border.
   A similar provision was included in the U.S.-Canada free trade
agreement signed by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney earlier this year. It was included in both the legislation
and the agreement at the urging of politically influential maritime
unions concerned about the impact on jobs.
   The House passed the trade measure Thursday by a vote of
312-107, more than enough to override the threatened presidential
veto.
   The 1,000-page bill would streamline the system under which the
United States imposes import restrictions and takes other steps
against international trade violations.
   It also would overhaul the conditions under which such
restrictions are imposed to protect U.S. industries threatened by
surges in imports.
   In recent weeks, however, these provisions have been placed in
the shadow by debate on a host of other provisions ranging from
huge new agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits
tax on oil companies.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Oregon Case Involving Hallucinogenic Drug Peyote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court raised the possibility today
that states may deny unemployment benefits to workers fired for
using the hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious ceremonies.
   In a 5-3 ruling involving two men from Oregon, the justices
stopped short of deciding whether there is a constitutional right
to take peyote as a religious practice.
   The court ordered the Oregon courts to study the case further to
determine whether religious users of peyote, an illegal drug, may
have a right to unemployment benefits.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said,
``Because we are uncertain about the legality of the religous use
of peyote in Oregon, it is not now appropriate for us to decide
whether the practice is protected by the federal Constitution.''
   He noted that the federal government and some states exempt the
relgious use of peyote from criminal prosecution.
   But Stevens said criminal conduct _ possession of peyote in this
instance _ is not automatically entitled to constitutional
protection just because it is part of a religious ceremony.
   The court set aside a ruling by the Oregon Supreme Court that
denial of unemployment compensation to the two men violated their
right of religious freedom.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said the
Oregon Supreme Court already has decided the issue that today's
opinion urged it to address.
   ``Accordingly, I must assume that the (U.S. Supreme) Court has
tacitly left the Oregon Supreme Court the option to dispose of
these cases by simply reiterating its initial opinion and
appending, `And we really mean it,' or words to that effect,''
Brennan said.
   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun. The three said they would vote to uphold the Oregon
Supreme Court decision.
   The case involves Galen W. Black and Alfred L. Smith, who were
fired from the Douglas County, Ore., Council on Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) in 1983 and 1984,
respectively.
   Both men, members of the Native American Church, took small
amounts of peyote as part of a church sacrament.
   Peyote, a cactus ``button'' containing the hallucinogen
mescaline, is an illegal drug under Oregon law. There was evidence
that the amounts taken by Black and Smith were too small to produce
any hallucinatory effect.
   Black, who worked for ADAPT as a drug rehabilitation counselor,
was himself recovering from drug and alcohol addiction when he used
the peyote in September 1983. He had not used drugs or alcohol
since 1982.
   Smith, an alcoholic who had not used alcohol since 1957, worked
for ADAPT counseling alcoholics from 1982 until his firing in the
spring of 1984.
   Smith is a Klamath Indian. Black is not an Indian. There was no
dispute that both were members of the Native American Church and
sincerely believed that peyote is a part of the church's religious
practices.
   After Smith and Black were fired for refusing to take treatment
as relapsed addicts, state officials refused to pay unemployment
compensation to them.
   Smith and Black said using small quantities of peyote in the
Native American Church is comparable to sacramental use of small
quantities of wine in Christian religious ceremonies.
   Stevens said today that ``the illegality of an employee's
misconduct'' may be relevant to a claim that religious rights were
violated.
   ``For if a state has prohibited through its criminal laws
certain kinds of religiously motivated conduct without violating
the First Amendment, it certainly follows that it may impose the
lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation benefits to
persons who engage in that conduct,'' he said.
   He was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia. Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court in February after the
justices heard arguments in the case, did not take part in the
decision.
   The case is Employment Division vs. Smith, 86-946.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, then quickly turned mixed.
   Soybeans opened moderately lower, but the negative impact of the
Agriculture Department's denial of rumors that sparked a big
soybean rally Tuesday was not as strong as expected, analysts said.
   Buying interest surfaced shortly after the lower opening,
halting the slide in soybean futures and reversing the downward
movement of grain prices, said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago
with Research Department Inc.
   ``The fact that soybeans were able to recover and not sell off
spurred a lot of fund buying and commission house buying,
particularly in the corn and beans,'' Karlin said.
   Soybean futures prices skyrocketed late in Tuesday's session on
rumors of unexpected acreage reductions linked to a government
price-support program. But the USDA said the rumors were wrong.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.12} a bushel; corn was {
cent to 1 cent higher with May at $2.01 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with May at $1.66 a bushel; soybeans
were 2{ cents to 4{ cents lower with May at $6.73 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent to .47 cent higher with June at 70.87
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .37 cent higher with
April at 80.57 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to .53 cent higher
with June at 49.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .15 cent
to .85 cent higher with May at 52.40 cents a pound.
   Most livestock futures settled higher on Tuesday but pork
bellies finished lower.

<TEXT>
   Cadbury Schweppes PLC said Wednesday it would
strongly resist any attempt by General Cinema Corp. to try to
acquire the British candy and soft drink manufacturer.
   General Cinema said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it plans to increase its 17.7 percent stake in
Cadbury to more than 25 percent. General Cinema also said it
intends to meet federal regulations in a possible purchase of more
than half of the British company's stock.
   Cadbury, which makes Canada Dry and Mott's soft drinks as well
as Mounds and Almond Joy candy bars, said in a statement issued in
London that its ``attitude toward General Cinema remains
unchanged.''
   Cadbury has been critical of Brookline, Mass.-based General
Cinema since it announced its initial stake in January 1987.
   While Cadbury said General Cinema's SEC filing was ``too
ambiguous to be capable of clear interpretation,'' Cadbury added
that ``any attempted involvement or interference from them in the
management of the business ... would be unwelcome and strongly
resisted.''
   General Cinema described its initial stake in Cadbury as only an
investment. But in its SEC filing Tuesday, General Cinema said it
no longer can be considered a passive investor.
   Industry analysts estimate Cadbury could fetch between $2.8
billion and $3.5 billion.
   General Cinema holds a 60 percent stake in Neiman-Marcus Group
Inc., and is a 7-Up bottler as well as a cinema operator.

   Pepsico Inc. said Wednesday its first quarter
profit jumped 64 percent, citing robust growth in soft drink and
restaurant volume, continued strength in snack foods and a lower
tax rate.
   The company, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., said its profit
rose to $113.3 million, or 43 cents a share, in the three months
ended March 19 compared with a profit of $68.9 million, or 26 cents

   First quarter sales rose 13.2 percent to $2.57 billion from
$2.27 billion a year earlier.
   The latest results included a one-time charge of $14.5 million
before taxes for the reorganization of the domestic soft drink
business.
   The company said its earnings from soft drinks rose 9 percent on
an 11 percent rise in sales.
   It said case sales by domestic bottlers rose 7 percent,
including double-digit growth in Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew, while
case sales internationally rose 5 percent, including strong gains
in Asia, Canada and the Middle East.
   In the snack food business, Pepsico said its earnings rose 17
percent on a 7 percent sales increase. The division markets the
Frito-Lay brands.
   Pepsico's restaurant operations posted 31 percent earnings
growth on a 21 percent sales increase as average sales per domestic
restaurant rose 6 percent.
   The company said Pizza Hut had improved delivery results, while
domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants posted higher average
sales per store, partly due to the introduction of Chicken Littles
last summer.
   Earnings from Taco Bell restaurants fell, howewer, in comparison
with a strong first quarter in 1987, the company said.

<TEXT>
   A group of OPEC and independent
oil-producing nations declared today they had begun cooperating to
control oil prices but had reached no specific accords.
   James Audu, spokesman for the cartel, read a joint communique
following a short meeting between six OPEC and seven non-OPEC
countries that was designed to consider collaborative action to
shore up prices.
   The statement said the six OPEC members would present to the
rest of the cartel on Thursday a proposal by the independent
producers to cut the countries' oil exports by 5 percent for two
months. The statement said the meeting represented a ``new stage of
cooperation.''
   There was no immediate indication that the PEC group either
endorsed or rejected the proposal, which OPEC President Rilwanu
Lukman of Nigeria earlier had called a ``good beginning'' for
cooperation between oil producers.
   Iran, which was not involved in today's talks, declared its
support for the export-cutting plan, but most other countries gave
little indication of their views.
   Analysts said the proposal, if implemented, would push oil
prices higher.
   The proposal was put to an OPEC ministerial committee Tuesday
night by a group of seven independent oil-producing nations,
including Mexico and China.
   The plan calls for members of both groups to reduce oil exports
by 5 percent for two months, beginning May 1. It would mean
reducing exports by a total of about 800,000 barrels a day.
   The idea is to take enough oil off the world market to force
prices up to at least OPEC's target level of $18 a barrel.
   OPEC oil currently is selling for between $14 and $16 a barrel
and last month was slightly lower than that.
   The six OPEC ministers meeting today were to hold another
session later in the day with the seven outside producers. All 13
OPEC members then were to convene Thursday to consider the
export-cut plan.
   Paul Mlotok, an analyst for the investment firm Salomon Brothers
Inc. and an observer of the Vienna meetings, said the plan, if
implemented, would have ``a very positive'' effect on the oil
market, which has been weakened by excess supplies.
   Most the OPEC members represented in today's talks withheld
immediate comment on the proposal, which the cartel had solicited.
   The seven non-OPEC countries involved in the talks are Mexico,
China, Egypt, Angola, Oman, Malaysia and Colombia.
   Delegation sources said later that OPEC and the independent
producers already were squabbling over terms of the proposal.
   Colombia, participating in the talks on the non-OPEC side,
indicated it would not join in the export reductions, said the
sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   OPEC officials also had asserted privately that some of the
independent producers had inflated the figures for their current
exports in order to minimize the impact on their actual sales,
these sources said.
   Hisham Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, declined to say
whether his country supported the proposed cut in exports. He told
reporters, however, that ``we'd like greater participation'' by
independent producers in export reductions. He did not mention any
countries by name.
   Kazempour Ardebili, the deputy Iranian oil minister, said in an
interview that his government favored the plan.
   ``We accept the extent of the cut'' in exports, he said, adding
that Iran hoped additional non-OPEC countries, including Norway and
the Soviet Union, could be brought into the plan.
   Ardebili also criticized Saudi Arabia's decision to break
diplomatic relations with Tehran.
   He said the move was not likely to interfere with the OPEC
deliberations in Vienna, ``although it may have been intended to
have that effect.''
   He also asserted that the United States was behind the Saudi
decision, announced Tuesday.
   ``This is a justification for more (U.S.) military presence in
the (Persian) Gulf in the future,'' Ardebili said.
   Members of the Saudi delegation to the OPEC talks were not
immediately available for comment.
   The proposal to cut oil exports was presented to the OPEC
committee by Mexico's oil minister, Fernando Hiriart. He said
afterward that for the non-OPEC group a 5 percent reduction would
amount to cutting exports by 200,000 barrels a day.
   He declined to say what Mexico or the other independent
producers would do if OPEC did not agree to the export-reduction
offer.
   OPEC is sharply divided about whether it should reduce its oil
production, although it long has welcomed the prospect of
collaborative efforts by independent oil-producers.
   Any joint action would mark the first such accord with outside
oil producers in OPEC's 28-year history.
   Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad Commission _ which
regulates that state's oil industry _ said Tuesday that he saw a
50-50 chance the Vienna meeting would produce an agreement to cut
oil output.
   Hance was not involved in the group meetings but was holding
private talks with individual OPEC and non-OPEC officials to
underscore what he called his state's desire to see stable oil
prices.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Officials Grateful for `Breathing Room' for Chrysler
Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Auto Talks</HEAD>

   Chrysler Corp.'s decision to continue auto
production at its plant in Kenosha, Wis., at least through the end
of the year will buy the area valuable time to create new jobs,
Wisconsin officials said today.
   ``It's just outstanding news,'' Rep. Peter Barca, D-Kenosha,
said, referring to the No. 3 automaker's announcement today that it
will delay closing the 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha.
   ``This gives us much more breathing room to bring new production
to that plant,'' said James Klauser, the top adviser to Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. ``This is very important, it's positive,
it's significant, but it doesn't mean the problem has gone away.''
   The problem, Klauser said, is finding new jobs for the 5,500
auto workers who will lose their jobs when Chrysler halts auto
production in Kenosha.
   ``The extension until the end of the year is certainly a step in
the right direction,'' Sen. Joseph Andrea, D-Kenosha, said. `` I
hope at the end of the year they look at another extension.''
   The time is needed, he said, to develop Kenosha's industrial
park, complete new business and commercial developments, expand the
local airport and compete for a dog racing track.
   Klauser and Barca agreed that negative reaction to Chrysler's
announcement that it was moving some production of its K-cars to
Mexico was responsible for the reprieve at Kenosha.
   ``I think Chrysler is embarrassed by the publicity of moving
jobs to Mexico,'' Klauser said.
   ``Their announcement of moving production to Mexico hit the
public like cold water early in the morning,'' Barca said.

   Chrysler Corp. will delay closing
its 5,500-worker assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., and will produce
its K-car in the United States during the car's phaseout, the No. 3
automaker said today.
   Chrysler had planned to move the Omni-Horizon small car in July
from the Kenosha plant to Detroit's Jefferson Avenue assembly
plant, shifting production of the K-car from the Detroit plant and
a plant in Newark, Del., to Mexico.
   The Kenosha plant was scheduled for a probable fall closing,
following the current model run for the rear-wheel-drive Dodge
Diplomat, Plymouth Grand Fury and Chrysler Fifth Avenue. But the
plant's workers now will be employed through the end of the year.
   The announcement of the reprieve for the Kenosha plant was
hailed today by Wisconsin officials, who said Chrysler's decision
will buy the area valuable time to create new jobs.
   ``I do not want any more misunderstandings about Kenosha. It
will only delay the closing. ... It will keep a full work force on
through year's end, and that's it,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
said this morning at a news conference.
   K-car plant production will continue at Detroit and Delaware
plants until 1989 orders are filled, Iacocca said. He said in the
event that 20,000 to 40,000 more K-cars are needed before phaseout,
that production would take place in January in Mexico.
   As scheduled, the Newark plant will be converted to production
of a K-car replacement by early fall, Chrysler said.
   The announcement came after the UAW threatened to scrap early
contract talks aimed at implementing an industry-pattern contract
established last fall at General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   The early talks also were designed to cool tempers over the
Kenosha closing and Chrysler's failed attempt to sell its
28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary.
   Chrysler attributed the decisions on Kenosha and K-car
production to better-than-expected sales of all cars in the first
quarter and to success in marketing the Dodge Aries and Plymouth
Reliant, along with the Omni Horizon, as ``America'' vehicles.
   Under the America program, Chrysler has cut prices and added
standard equipment on aging vehicles to boost sales.
   ``The first quarter was our best in 15 years at Chrysler. Our
sales sizzled,'' Iacocca said in a statement. He said several of
the company's cars and trucks had record sales in the first quarter.
   Chrysler also said sales of the Omni Horizon jumped 80 percent
from December to the beginning of April, while sales of the Aries
and Reliant rose 153 percent since their inclusion in the America
program.
   Iacocca said Chrysler plans to increase production of cars and
trucks by 110,000 vehicles in the second half of 1988.
   UAW officials were not immediately available for comment.
   Contract talks that opened amiably last week turned tense this
week, as union bargainers boycotted negotiations for five hours
Monday in protest of Chrysler's announced executive compensation
and plans to move K-car production to Mexico.
   The national contract, which expires Sept. 14, covers 66,000
active workers in 15 states and 65,000 retirees. Kenosha pacts
covering the workers to be affected by the closing and 1,000 engine
plant workers are being negotiated separately.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The De Beers diamond cartel said Wednesday it was
increasing prices for rough gemstones by an average of 13.5 percent
as worldwide sales sparkle despite last fall's stock market crash.
   Sales of diamonds, which are priced in dollars, have benefitted
from the drop in the U.S. currency, which makes them cheaper to
holders of Japanese yen and European currencies.
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., a Johannesburg-based concern
which controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market
through its London-based marketing arm, Central Selling
Organization, said the price increases for a broad range of uncut
diamonds would take effect May 3.
   When De Beers last increased its prices, by an average 10
percent on Oct. 5, it boosted its prices for the better-quality
diamonds the most.
   But spokesman Richard Dickson said the latest increases ``are
not weighted toward any particular category.'' De Beers does not
disclose actual prices.
   The October price increase was the only price increase in 1987
and followed an increase of 14.5 percent in two stages in 1986.
   The wholesale price of a polished, one-carat, D-flawless diamond
_ the highest grade _ was more than $17,000 in April.
   The cartel, which sets prices for rough diamonds only, operates
a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in Africa and Australia to
dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond centers _ Antwerp,
Bombay, New York and Tel Aviv.
   ``The rough market is strong, the prices of polished diamonds
are strong, retail demand is good,'' Dickson said. ``Much of the
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from Japan and
Southeast Asia.''
   De Beers reported record sales of $3.075 billion in 1987, up 23
percent from sales of $2.5 billion in 1986.
   Diamond sales, which slumped in the early 1980s, jumped even
though De Beers cut supply after the Oct. 19 stock market crash,
Dickson said.
   Jewelry sales generally were strong at Christmas, he said.
   ``The mood is optimistic and we would look forward to 1988 being
a good year,'' Dickson said. But he declined to provide a forecast.
   De Beers holds about 10 sales for international diamond dealers
a year, Dickson said.
   Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used
primarily for drilling because they are so hard. Between 10 percent
and 20 percent are gems.

<HEAD>Sugarman Loses Court Round In Takeover Bid for Media General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California investor Burt Sugarman's bid for
Media General Inc. suffered a setback today with a ruling that
prevents a simple majority of votes from deciding the fate of his
$1.6 billion offer.
   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams ruled Sugarman's
$61.50-a-share offer would have to be approved by two-thirds of
each class of shareholders, who must vote separately.
   Like a number of media companies, Media General has two classes
of stock to keep control of the company in the hands of a few
shareholders. While there are fewer Class B shares outstanding,
those shares are more powerful than Class A shares.
   Edward Brodsky, Sugarman's attorney, argued that Media General's
charter allows a simple majority decision by a combined vote of
shareholders representing the company's two classes of stock.
   Brodsky said he would appeal the ruling.
   But R. Harvey Chappell Jr., Media General's attorney, said the
special voting provision applied only to acquisions by the company
and not to a concern trying to acquire it.
   ``This is not an acquisition by Media General,'' Chappell said.
``This is an acquisition of Media General.''
   The family of Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan has
opposed Sugarman's offer. The Bryan family owns 71 percent of the
company's more powerful 559,168 Class B shares.
   Williams' ruling, however, did not end the case. Sugarman also
has proposed three candidates _ including himself _ for election to
the company's 10-member board of directors. An election will be
held at the company's annual meeting next month.
   Those three seats are elected by Class A shareholders. Sugarman
controls 10 percent of Media General's 28 million Class A shares.
   Williams withheld rulings on other aspects of the takeover
fight, including Sugarman's contention that only Class-A board
members should be allowed to consider his offer, pending the
outcome of the proxy battle on the board seats.
   Media General is the parent company of Richmond Newspapers Inc.,
publisher of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News
Leader. The company also holds other newspaper interests and owns
several television stations.
   Sugarman is chairman of the California-based Barris Industries,
which produces ``The Dating Game'' and other popular television
games shows, and the South Carolina-based Giant Group Ltd., a
cement company.

<TEXT>
   Former Penn Square banker William Patterson's
desperate efforts to save his failing bank led him to enlist two
cash-strapped accomplices in a scheme to defraud Continental
Illinois Bank, prosecutors say.
   Charged along with Patterson are John Lytle, a former
Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. vice president who
headed the Chicago bank's energy-lending division for Oklahoma, and
Tulsa drilling contractor Jere Sturgis.
   A federal court jury resumed deliberations this morning after
failing to reach a decision during more than two hours of
deliberations Tuesday.
   The government contends that Lytle, caught in spiraling personal
debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, accepted kickbacks from
Patterson in exchange for funding and attempting to fund high-risk
energy loans from Continental for Penn Square customers between
July 1981 and July 1982.
   ``Lytle had become so financially tied to Bill Patterson he
couldn't move without him,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Duffy
said in closing arguments. ``And as long as the Continental doors
were open to Bill Patterson, the (Penn Square) doors were open to
John Lytle.
   ``Common sense,'' Duffy added, facing the jurors, ``should tell
you that he (Lytle) couldn't serve two masters.''
   Lytle and Patterson are charged with wire fraud and
misapplication of funds; Sturgis with wire fraud.
   The indictment cited Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers, many without any
documentation.
   It did not say how much was recovered by the giant Chicago bank,
which came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part because of its
troubled energy loans.
   Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City collapsed in July 1982 under
the weight of energy loans it could not collect. In 1984,
Continental needed a $4.5 billion government bailout to survive one
of the largest runs on deposits in banking history.
   ``Why didn't John Lytle, a 20-year employee, review these loans
the way he'd been trained, the way his staff had recommended?''
Duffy asked.
   ``It's simple _ because Bill Patterson wanted these made,
because he needed them to keep his bank afloat.''
   Prosecutors also charged that Lytle and Sturgis engaged in a
related ``buy-back'' investment scheme, in which Sturgis inflated
the return on Lytle's investment in Sturgis' operations threefold
to improve his chances of getting a Continental loan through Lytle.
   Patterson, who was a vice president at Penn Square, was the link
between Lytle and Sturgis, said Duffy.
   ``Bill Patterson is the central figure in this case and John
Lytle and Jere Sturgis are like planets revolving around the sun,''
said Duffy.
   ``John Lytle and Jere Sturgis were completely financially
dependent on Bill Patterson and Penn Square.''
   Penn Square was the only bank willing to extend Lytle and
Sturgis additional funds at the time, Duffy contended, and lent
Sturgis $3 million, which enabled him to buy out Lytle's $150,000
investment for $475,000.
   The ``buy-back'' scheme was devised as a way for Lytle to clear
much of his personal debt and for Sturgis, who was then being
pursued by creditors for more than $100 million in business loans,
to find a new lending source, said Duffy.
   Attorneys for Lytle and Patterson contended in their closing
arguments Monday that Continental was saddled with troublesome oil
and energy loans because of an aggressive lending policy, not
because of a fraud scheme.

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. reported Wednesday
that its first-quarter earnings jumped 19 percent, largely because
of record beer sales.
   For the first quarter of 1988, earnings were $152.4 million, or
51 cents a share, compared with earnings of $128.1 million, or 42
cents a share, for the first three months of 1987.
   First-quarter sales rose 7.3 percent to $2.26 billion from $2.11
billion in 1987.
   Growth in earnings per share benefitted from lower federal tax
rates and from having fewer shares outstanding as a result of the
company's share repurchase program, the company said.
   The company said its brewery subsidiary, Anheuser-Busch Inc.,
produced and sold 19.2 million barrels of beer during the first
quarter, a 4.8 percent increase over the 18.3 million barrels sold
in the same period a year ago.
   Market share for beer climbed to 41.8 percent from 40.3 percent
a year ago, the company said. Those figures are based on industry
sales estimates, including imports.
   The company's 12th brewery opened during the first quarter in
Fort Collins, Colo., and began shipping beer in late March.
   Campbell Taggart, the company's diversified food subsidiary and
the second largest contributor to corporate profit, also increased
its earnings during the first quarter. Bakery operations continued
to benefit from cost control programs, and international operations
experienced favorable exchange rates and improved margins, the
company said.
   In addition, the company's entertainment subsidiary, Busch
Entertainment Corp., increased its profit contribution. The growth
was mainly related to increased attendance at Busch Gardens, the
company's theme park in Tampa, Fla., which is hosting a pair of
giant pandas from the People's Republic of China, the company said.

   The stock market was little changed in quiet
trading today after an early advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in the early going, showed a 2.49 gain at 2,047.25 by 2 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers were evenly balanced in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 693 up, 685 down and
515 unchanged.
   Analysts said the latest government statistics seemed to support
hopes that the economy was neither slipping into a recession nor
growing at a dangerously fast pace.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product expanded
at a 2.3 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in
the first quarter of the year.
   Still, brokers said traders remained highly sensitive to the
recent volatility of stock prices, warily watching the ups and
downs of stock-index futures for swings that might touch off a
round of program trading activity.
   DuPont gained 2[ to 86|. The company reported higher
first-quarter earnings and raised its quarterly dividend from 85 to
95 cents a share.
   Union Carbide, another component of the Dow Jones industrial
average, rose ~ to 23}. The company said its results for the first
half of 1988 will be better than had been expected.
   Cadbury Schweppes jumped 7] to 67] in the over-the-counter
market. General Cinema said it planned to seek approval to increase
its 17.7 percent stake in the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .08 to 148.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .04 at 301.49.
   Volume on the Big Board came 98.68 million shares with two hours

   Stock prices ended higher Wednesday, although
waning enthusiasm late in the day led the market to trim many of
its early gains.
   Takeover speculation, again ruled the day. Traders said that
without it, London stocks would have been flat at best.
   ``The rest of the market's just marking time,'' said one
market-maker.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 5.9
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,806.7. The index had risen as much as
13.1 points after midday.
   Volume was moderate at 517.5 million shares, up from 428.0
million Tuesday.
   Volume in some individual stocks, however, was strong, including
Cadbury Schweppes PLC, subject of takeover speculation, and British
confectioner Rowntree PLC, the target of a hostile bid from Nestle
S.A.
   Nestle's Tuesday offer of 2.1 billion pounds, or $3.9 billion,
continued to lift a wide range of food stocks.
   Rowntree finished 2 pence, or or 3.7 cents, lower at 926 pence,
or $1.73 dollars, after its $3.29 leap Tuesday.
   Cadbury finished at 362 pence, or $6.77, up 58 cents. The
company said it would strongly resist any takeover attempt by
Brookline, Mass.-based General Cinema Corp., which on Tuesday said
its plans to increase its 17.7 percent stake in Cadbury.

<HEAD>Lofty Salaries Rare Among Top Japanese Executives</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Executive Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Japan, where most company executives are
employees who have climbed the ladder within their firms, there are
no high-paid executives like Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A.
Iacocca, experts say.
   There seems to be an understanding among workers that executives
are paid reasonably, although Japanese bosses don't have to report
their incomes publicly and often enjoy valued benefits not included
in paychecks, ranging from limousines to golf course memberships.
   ``Japanese top executives are not making huge sums of money like
some of their American counterparts,'' said an official of the
Federation of Japan Automobile Workers' Union, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``I've never heard of pay for executives being used as a
strategy for any labor negotiation. It is also taken for granted
that in case of a business slump, executives voluntarily cut their
pay by about 10 percent before resorting to such measures as laying
off workers,'' he said.
   Some U.S. compensation experts say it's difficult to compare
payscales for executives in different countries. One reason Japan's
executives have lower pay than their American counterparts is the
sharply higher Japanese tax rate.
   ``Look at a country like England, where executive compensation
is quite low in cash, but's that because they have a prohibitive
tax structure. So they give it in perks. Same in Japan,'' said
Charles Peck, a compensation specialist at the Conference Board, a
New York-based business research group. ``Studies in international
compensation are just too difficult.''
   Nevertheless, pay levels for Japanese executives became an issue
in the United States during recent labor negotiations at Chrysler
Corp. The United Auto Workers, criticizing the multimillion-dollar
pay received by top Chrysler executives, particularly Iacocca, said
it would adopt Japanese-style production methods if Chrysler
executives accepted a Japanese-style pay system.
   Unlike the United States, in Japan the salaries of top
executives are considered private, even in publicly held companies.
Private research companies estimate the figures.
   Estimates compiled by Seikei Kenkyujo, a private research
company, put the average yearly pay for presidents of major vehicle
manufacturers at about 26.25 million yen ($211,700) and that of
chairmen at 18.30 million yen ($147,600).
   For electrical firms, an average president is paid the
equivalent of $180,500, while a chairman receives $169,500.
   The figures from Seikei Kenkyujo include cash compensation and
bonus payments, but not money earned through stock dividends or
capital gains.
   An average Japanese automobile firm worker earns about $31,000
in salary and bonuses and electric firm workers about $29,400.
   Statistics suggest that the average president of a Japanese
automobile or electrical firm earns about six or seven times more
than his workers.
   In another widely publicized difference from the United States,
Japanese workers and executives seldom move to another company, and
high achievers move steadily up through the ranks.
   ``In Japan, it is very rare for companies to bring someone from
other companies and appoint him as a new president or chairman,
paying outrageous sums of money,'' said Hiroyuki Kikuya of the Wage
and Income Research Institute, a private institute.
   Pay for a top Japanese executive is set in accordance with the
company's regular pay scale based on seniority, he said.
   Kikuya also noted that in Japan not much attention is paid to
how much an individual contributes to a company, unlike the norm in
the United States where top executives are expected to make a
stronger personal impact on their firms.
   ``Emphasis is always on the company as a whole, and therefore it
is natural that the company's success is not reflected in what
executives earn,'' Kikuya said.
   ``There might be some who are using company cars, live in
company-owned houses, keep maids or buy golf club memberships with
company expenses, but even if these expenses are counted as their
income, I don't think they add up to much,'' he said.
   The National Tax Admimistration Agency announces the names of
the top 100 taxpayers each year. The list contains many top company
executives but does not say how much they earn or their taxable
income.

   A group of 13 OPEC and independent
oil-producing nations proclaimed a new stage of cooperation
Wednesday to stabilize world oil prices but failed to reach
specific agreements.
   Six of the seven non-OPEC producers attending a widely watched
meeting with cartel members offered to cut oil exports by 5 percent
if OPEC did likewise. The stated goal was to push up prices to $18
a barrel and keep them there.
   Colombia was the lone holdout in the group of independent oil
exporters.
   The OPEC group neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal,
saying it would present it to a meeting of the full Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries on Thursday.
   Some analysts have said the plan, if accepted by OPEC and
implemented, probably would push OPEC oil prices up quickly from
their current level of $14 to $16 a barrel.
   There was no immediate indication of how many OPEC members might
accept the proposal. Asked by reporters if he liked it, OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria was noncommital, saying: ``It's
a good proposal in that it's a proposal we've never had before.''
   Earlier, Lukman had called the proposal a ``good beginning'' for
cooperation between major oil producers.
   Iran, which was not involved in Wednesday's talks, declared its
support for the plan, but officials from most other member
countries withheld direct comment.
   Fernando Hiriart, the Mexican oil minister and unofficial leader
of the non-OPEC group, told reporters after a short meeting with
the six OPEC countries that he was ``very satisfied'' with the
outcome.
   The non-OPEC countries won't be participating in Thursday's OPEC
conference.
   The Vienna meeting marked the widest participation by
independent oil producers in direct talks with OPEC in the 28-year
history of the cartel.
   OPEC has said repeatedly in recent years that all oil-producing
countries, including the United States and Soviet Union, must share
the burden of controlling production if violent swings in oil
prices are to be prevented.
   In a joint statement, the OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Vienna
said their meeting was an important first step.
   ``It constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperation
between a large number of oil producing countries,'' the statement
said. `The underlying assumption shared by all is that a stable oil
market is the responsibility of all and consequently the burden
should be shared.''
   The statement said the independent producers believed that oil
production restraint was needed to bring prices back up to OPEC's
target of $18 a barrel.
   Missing from the statement was any indication that the six OPEC
countries who participated in the meeting Wednesday favored further
cuts in the cartel's production as part of a price-stabilizing plan.
   Iran, Algeria and Venezuela have said they want to negotiate
cuts in OPEC production, but others, including Saudi Arabia,
Nigeria and Indonesia, have been reluctant to commit themselves to
this.
   The Saudi-led faction fears that any production cuts by OPEC
would only be offset by increases in output by other nations that
are not cooperating with OPEC.
   The seven non-OPEC countries involved in the talks were Mexico,
China, Egypt, Angola, Oman, Malaysia and Colombia.
   Brunei was invited but did not attend.
   Kazempour Ardebili, deputy Iranian oil minister, said in an
interview that his government favored the plan presented by the
non-OPEC countries..
   ``We accept the extent of the cut'' in exports, he said, adding
that Iran hoped additional non-OPEC countries, including Norway and
the Soviet Union, could be brought into the plan.
   Ardebili also criticized Saudi Arabia's decision to break
diplomatic relations with Tehran.
   He said the move wasn't likely to interfere with the OPEC
deliberations in Vienna, ``although it may have been intended to
have that effect.''
   He also asserted that the United States was behind the Saudi
decision, which was announced Tuesday, in order to justify a
greater U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, where Iranian
and American forces have clashed.
   The proposal to cut oil exports was presented to the OPEC
committee by Hiriart, the Mexican minister. He said afterward that
for the non-OPEC group a 5 percent reduction would amount to
cutting exports by 200,000 barrels a day.
   A 5 percent cut in OPEC's oil exports would equal between
700,000 and 800,000 barrels.

   A generation after OPEC learned the
tricks of the oil trade from America, a self-styled envoy from the
heart of U.S. oil country has come to OPEC to see how the cartel
works.
   He's Kent Hance, a handsome, smooth-talking, 45-year-old former
U.S. congressman who currently is a member of the Texas Railroad
Commission, which regulates that state's large petroleum industry.
   Hance's attendance as an observer to a special meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has received
widespread attention and aroused U.S. criticism that Texas could
become an accomplice to the cartel's price-fixing strategies, which
often have been seen as harmful to American interests.
   Hance rejected the criticism as groundless.
   ``We're not in love with OPEC, but we need to have input'' into
decisions by an organization that control about 35 percent of the
world's oil supplies, he said in an interview Wednesday.
   Ensconced in his hotel room in central Vienna, Hance patiently
awaited word on a twice-postponed appointment to see Rilwanu
Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister who doubles as OPEC's president.
Vienna is the cartel's headquarters.
   Hance said OPEC is a friendly group that's ``glad to have
someone from the United States to have a dialogue with.'' But he
finds it hard to adapt to OPEC officials' disregard for time
schedules.
   He'd been told by Lukman's aides that he could see the minister
after an OPEC meeting that initially was set for 2 p.m., then
rescheduled for 3 p.m., then 4 p.m. The session finally started
about 5 p.m.
   He said he was still trying to adjust to what outsiders call
``OPEC time.''
   Hance said he sees his mission as opening a dialogue with the
cartel that the U.S. government refuses to deal with.
   ``I look at what's happened to our Texas economy'' since oil
prices crashed in 1986, he said. ``No one else is going to be
speaking up for the state of Texas, and someone had to do
something.''
   A Republican, he ackowledged that ``I'm subject to criticism''
for talking with OPEC about ways to stabilize oil prices, in
defiance of the stated wishes of the Reagan administration.
   He said the two other members of the Texas Railroad Commission
are ``too cautious'' to undertake such a controversial venture.
   ``I was the one who thought of this idea last fall,'' he said.
``If I think of something that might work, I'll take a risk.''
   Hance met Monday with Fadhil al-Chabili, the OPEC deputy
secretary general who administers the cartel's secretariat, and
other OPEC staff members.
   He also held meetings with the oil ministers of Venezuela and
Indonesia, as well as officials of non-OPEC oil-producing countries
such as Norway.
   Hance said he's been impressed by the OPEC oil ministers'
knowledge of the business.
   ``They have a good understanding of oil,'' he said. ``What they
just can't understand is why a country that is the No. 1 oil
consumer and the No. 2 producer doesn't have an energy policy.''
   Hance said the U.S. government should be in direct and regular
contact with OPEC as part of a national energy policy.
   ``If I were a farmer and I grew carrots, and that's all I did
and there was one entity, one person, in the world that set the
price of carrots, I would want to know that person and have some
input,'' he said.
   OPEC will become increasingly important to the United States in
the next decade, Hance said, predicting that 65 percent of American
oil supplies would be imported by 1992, up from 40 percent now.
   ``We have to have some input ... rather than burying our heads
in the sand and hope OPEC treats us okay,'' he said. ``How have
they treated us without (U.S.) input? Not very well.''
   He rejected suggestions that the United States should not deal
with an organization whose market-rigging methods it dislikes.
   ``We don't agree with the Soviets. They're our enemies. But we
still have a dialogue with them.''

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range today
after an early advance faded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 10 points
in the early going, showed a 5.64 gain at 2,050.40 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Losers slightly olutnumbered gainers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 679 up, 713 down and 539
unchanged.
   Analysts said the latest government statistics seemed to support
hopes that the economy was neither slipping into a recession nor
growing at a dangerously fast pace.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product expanded
at a 2.3 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in
the first quarter of the year.
   Still, brokers said traders remained highly sensitive to the
recent volatility of stock prices, warily watching the ups and
downs of stock-index futures for swings that might touch off a
round of program trading activity.
   DuPont gained 2\ to 86}. The company reported higher
first-quarter earnings and raised its quarterly dividend from 85 to
95 cents a share.
   Union Carbide, another component of the Dow Jones industrial
average, rose 1 to 23~. The company said its results for the first
half of 1988 will be better than had been expected.
   Cadbury Schweppes jumped 7 to 67] in the over-the-counter
market. General Cinema said it planned to seek approval to increase
its 17.7 percent stake in the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .03 to 148.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off .13 at 301.32.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Wednesday a major
restructuring of air service after a two-week strike and bankruptcy
at its Aeromexico airline.
   The Communications and Transportation Department said a
commission would study possibly forming a new trunk airline to
replace Aeromexico, especially for the 15 Mexican cities now left
without any major air service.
   ``Once the initial moment of this process is passed, (the
commission) will proceed to a review of the route system of
national aviation and to an intense promotion of regional and local
air transportation,'' the department said.
   Among the regional, privately owned airlines expected to benefit
the most are Aeromar in central Mexico, Aerocalifornia in the
northwest and Aerocaribe in the southeast.
   The business daily El Financiero said the government and unions
still could work out a plan to resume Aeromexico service on its
most viable routes, to 10 or 14 Mexican cities, by as early as late
this week.
   Rene Arce, spokesman for the National Technical Workers Union
that went out on strike April 12, said legal action will be taken
to protest the decision.
   ``In reality what they were looking for was to deal us a blow,
and they succeeded in doing just that,'' he said.
   The government said labor troubles, a chronic financial deficit
and deficient service had produced the problem at Aeromexico. It
blamed the union for not accepting an earlier plan to restructure
the airline by reducing the fleet and route system.
   The airline filed for bankruptcy four days after the strike by
the 7,200 ground workers started, saying it was losing more than $1
million a day as a result.
   Meanwhile, late Tuesday, the Federal Mediation Board declared
the two-week-old strike illegal and ordered employees to turn back
all facilities to management.
   The board said the striking union failed to comply with a
statutory requirement that two-thirds of union members in Mexico
City vote for the walkout.
   A federal judge declared the airline bankrupt and ordered it
into receivership on April 18.
   Aeromexico employed about 7,200 ground workers as well as 1,200
cabin attendants and 800 pilots whose unions did not support the
strike.
   Aeromexico started business in 1934 and has been owned by the
government since 1957. It was operating 223 flights daily to 42
domestic and internatioal destinations before the strike.
   The government's other airline, Mexicana, and a small state
agency called Federal Air Transport already have filled some of the
vacuum caused by the lack of Aeromexico service.
   The statement said 14 million of the 17 million air passengers
in Mexico last year were carried by Aeromexico or Mexicana,
controlled by the government since 1982.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade with much of the selling due to
profit-taking after Tuesday's sharp rise in soybean prices.
   The rally Tuesday had been fueled by rumors, later denied by the
Agriculture Department, that the government plans to severely
restrict planting of the soybean crop.
   The selling pressure Wednesday was offset by light commission
house and fund buying, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybeans also got a boost from reports of rainy weather slowing
the Brazilian soybean harvest, which is more than half complete.
   ``It should take a few days for the fields to dry out there,''
Karlin said.
   Corn was nearly unchanged. Wheat retreated slightly on
profit-taking.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with the
contrat for delivery in May at $3.10{ a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 1 cent higher with May at $2.00} a bushel; oats were } cent to
1{ cents higher with May at $1.67 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents
lower to 3{ cents higher with May at $6.75{ a bushel.

   Wendy's International Inc. said Wednesday it
had a profit of $3.5 million in the first quarter in contrast to a
loss of $6.8 million in the same period a year earlier.
   The hamburger restaurant chain operator said the improvement
reflected success in the company's efforts to build sales and cut
costs.
   The earnings for the quarter ended April 3 amounted to 4 cents
per share.
   First-quarter revenue slipped 1.2 percent to $253.6 million from
$256.6 million in the comparable period a year earlier.
   Robert L. Barney, Wendy's chairman and chief executive, said the
revenue came from 60 fewer company-operated restaurants than in
1987, most of which were sold to franchise owners.
   Systemwide sales, which include sales at restaurants operated by
franchisees as well as those owned by the company, rose 4 percent
to $682 million from $655.9 million in 1987.
   Average net sales for restaurants systemwide rose 7.3 percent to
$177,000 in the quarter from $169,000 a year earlier, the company
said. The average at company-owned stores was up 6 percent to
$189,000 from $179,000, it said.
   ``These results provide compelling evidence that the steps
Wendy's took in 1987 to build sales and reduce costs are paying
off,'' Barney said.
   He said the results were more impressive because the first
quarter is usually Wendy's slowest of the year.
   Among the features introduced last year is the SuperBar, an
all-you-can-eat food buffet that offers salads, Mexican and Italian
food that is now available in about 1,600 of the company's 3,798
restaurants.
   James Near, president and chief operating officer, said the
SuperBars have helped build repeat business and attract new
customers.
   The SuperBar was added to 586 restaurants in the first quarter,
and Near said virtually all of the 1,100 company-owned restaurants
in the United States should have the SuperBar by June while about
half of the franchised restaurants in the U.S. should have it by
this fall.
   He also cited the company's new advertising campaign for helping
the company recapture momentum by drawing attention to its
hamburgers.
   The commercials offer a humorous parody of taste tests, as a
series of people choosing between a fresh Wendy's hamburger and a
wilted offering from someone else select the competitor's burger
for all the wrong reasons.

<HEAD>Jury Deliberations Stretch Into Second Day in Continental Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury deliberations stretched into a second day
Wednesday in the federal trial of three men, two of them former
bank executives, charged with scheming to defraud the Continental
Illinois Bank and Trust Co.
   The seven-week trial went to the jury late Tuesday after
instructions from presiding U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur.
   At midday Wednesday, jurors sent a question to Shadur, who
promptly talked with defendant William Patterson, his attorney,
Burck Bailey and government prosecutors during a brief telephone
conference call.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Duffy said the question was over
d his leverage over the
finances of his two cash-strapped co-defendants in a scheme to save
his own failing bank.
   Former Continental Vice President John Lytle and Tulsa, Okla.,
oil contractor Jere Sturgis also are on trial.
   The indictment cited Lytle's alleged links to $44 million in
``imprudent'' loans made by Continental to 12 Penn Square
customers, many without any documentation. It did not say how much
was recovered by the Chicago bank.
   Penn Square Bank collapsed in July 1982 under the weight of
energy loans it could not collect. In 1984, Continental needed a
$4.5 billion government bailout to survive one of the largest runs
on deposits in banking history.
   The government contends that Lytle was caught in spiraling
personal debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle, and accepted
kickbacks from Patterson. The kicbacks were allegedly in exchange
for funding and attempting to fund high-risk energy loans from
Continental for Penn Square customers between July 1981 and July
1982.
   Prosecutors also charge that Lytle and Sturgis engaged in a
related ``buy-back'' investment scheme, in which Sturgis inflated
the return on Lytle's investment in Sturgis' operations threefold
to improve his chances of getting a Continental loan through Lytle.
   The indictment alleges the ``buy-back'' scheme was devised as a
way for Lytle to clear much of his personal debt and for Sturgis,
who was then being pursued by creditors for over $100 million in
business loans, to find a new lending source in Continental.
   Lytle and Patterson are charged with wire fraud and
misapplication of funds; Sturgis with wire fraud.
   All three men have pleaded innocent.

   Two months after the stock market crash, a local
resident closed on an 11-room duplex apartment in Trump Tower for
$5.5 million _ the top price paid for an apartment in the city last
year.
   The buyer, who probably agreed to buy the apartment before Wall
Street's Oct. 19 collapse, should have no resale worries, according
to a real estate brokerage firm which on Wednesday released a
survey of top 1987 condominium prices.
   Although apartment sales were down between 40 percent and 50
percent in November and December following the stock plunge, three
of the top 10 condo deals were closed in those months, said Barbara
Corcoran, president of Corcoran Group.
   After that, she said, ``buyers came back into the market one by
one.''
   ``January was the turning point,'' she said, ``(now) the market
is back to where it was in October.''
   The Corcoran survey shows six of the 10 most expensive condo
purchases were made by corporations, two of them foreign. Four of
the top 10 condos were in Trump Tower, Ms. Corcoran said.
   One Trump Tower home, a 5{-room unit purchased for $3.2 million,
set the standard for price per square foot _ $1,273.
   Ms. Corcoran said that although information about sales of
apartments in cooperative buildings is not as easily accessible,
she was confident no co-op unit sale exceeded the Trump duplex
price.
   The two other Trump apartments in the top 10 were a five-room
unit that went for $3 million and a seven-room duplex that cost
$2.8 million.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.F. Ahmanson & Co., the nation's largest
thrift holding company, said Wednesday its first-quarter profit
plunged 66 percent largely because of a decline in earnings from
the sale of mortgage-backed securities.
   Ahmanson, parent of Home Savings of America, said it netted
$30.1 million, or 30 cents a share, down sharply from earnings of
$89.3 million, or 91 cents a share in the first quarter of 1987.
   The gap was widened by $6.9 million because earnings for the
earlier period were restated to reflect a required accounting
change.
   After-tax gains from sales of mortgage-backed securities were
$4.2 million, in contrast with gains of $51.2 million from such
sales in the first quarter of 1987.
   Net interest income, after provision for loan losses, was $188.7
million in the quarter ended March 31, up from $184.4 million a
year earlier. The company increased its provision for bad loans to
$10.8 million, from $5.1 million.
   Other income totaled $42.3 million for the quarter, down from
$121.9 a year earlier, largely because of the difference in sale of
mortgage-backed securities.
   Ahmanson has net assets of $38.1 billion. Home Savings is the
nation's largest savings and loan assocation.

Larchmont, N.Y., and Donald A. Sayles, chairman of Vyquest Inc, a
mobile home manufacturer based in New Jersey.
   Each was elected with 538,486 votes, or about 80 percent of the
votes cast at Wednesday's special meeting.
   The election gives preferred shareholders four of the 14 board
seats at Pittsburgh-based Allegheny International, which is
operating under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.
   The New York investment firms Carl Marks & Co. and Spear, Leeds
& Kellogg are mounting the proxy challenge. The investment firms
intend to put pressure on Allegheny International to find a buyer,
according to financial analysts.
   Minneapolis-based investors Irwin L. Jacobs and Carl R. Pohlad
hold a 7.9 percent stake in the company, and have indicated to the
Securities and Exchange Commission that they might seek control of
it. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., a major Wall Street investment
firm, also has a stake in the appliance maker.
   Allegheny International's regular shareholders meeting is
scheduled for May 20. Carl Marks and Spear, Leeds have nominated
three other representatives of preferred shareholders to challenge
three incumbent directors, including Chairman Oliver S. Travers Jr.
and Chief Operating Officer Thomas J. Albani.

<HEAD>Dollar Weakens in Domestic Dealings; Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished weaker against major
currencies except the British pound in light domestic dealings
Wednesday after firming earlier overseas.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$450.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with $449 late
Tuesday.
   Traders said the dollar moved listlessly, unable to break
through key barriers against the West German mark and the Japanese
yen.
   ``The inability to move through those resistance levels just
provided a little room for traders to push the dollar down a bit,''
said James McGroarty, a vice president at Discount Corp.
   The market chose to ignore a Commerce Department report that
personal incomes climbed 0.8 percent in March, the best showing
since last December. Consumer spending jumped a healthy 0.7 percent.
   ``It was a major non-event,'' said George DeLuna, a vice
president and trader at Irving Trust Co. ``All the numbers are
coming in where they've been expected to be,'' he said, also
referring to Tuesday's report the gross national product during the
first quarter.
   Whle the relatively strong personal income numbers indicate the
U.S. economy remains healthy, foreign exchange traders interpret
the data as a signal that ``little progress will be made on the
trade imbalance because we continue to consume foreign goods,''
McGroarty said.
   Meanwhile, with little reason for the dollar to make a decisive
move in either direction, ``people are happy to be making moderate
amounts of money trading in this small range,'' DeLuna said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.42 Japanese yen to close at 124.99
yen after breaking through the psychologically important 125-yen
level. Later in London, it was quoted higher at 125.20 yen. But in
New York, the dollar fell to close at 124.865 yen, from 125.15 yen
on Tuesday.
   The British pound eased in London to $1.8750, from $1.8760. In
New York it cost $1.8735 to buy one pound, less expensive than
Tuesday's $1.8744.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.67475 West German marks, down from 1.67735; 1.3870
Swiss francs, down from 1.38725; 5.6915 French francs, down from
5.6945; 1,245.50 Italian lire, down from 1,246.50, and 1.22835
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2286.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.6785
West German marks, up from 1.6747; 1.3905 Swiss francs, up from
1.3860; 5.6962 French francs, up from 5.6875; 1.8810 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8765; 1,246.82 Italian lire, up from 1,244.00,
and 1.2278 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2289.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $452.80 a troy
ounce, up from $449.80 on Tuesday.
   In London, gold rose to a bid price of $452 an ounce, up from
$447.50 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold also rose following a surge
in silver prices in options-related buying. The Swiss late bid
price was $451.50 an ounce, up from $448 late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.03 to close at a bid $450.97
an ounce.
   Silver prices also rose. On New York's Comex, silver closed at
$6.498 a troy ounce, up from $6.381 on Tuesday. In London silver
was quoted at a late bid price of $6.49 an ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $6.36.

   The stock market settled for a small gain
Wednesday at the close of a quiet, drifting session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.15 to 2,047.91,
posting its fifth consecutive gain.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in New York Stock
Exchange-listed trading, with 755 up, 711 down and 509 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 133.81 million shares, against 152.30
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index edged
up .01 to 148.94.
   Analysts said the latest government statistics seemed to support
hopes that the economy was neither slipping into a recession nor
growing at a dangerously fast pace.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the gross national product
expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate, after adjustment for
inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   Still, brokers said traders remained highly sensitive to the
recent volatility of stock prices, warily watching the ups and
downs of stock-index futures for swings that might touch off a
round of program trading activity.
   Over the past five sessions the Dow Jones industrial average has
risen 62.50 points. However, brokers say the advance hasn't caught
the fancy of many individual investors or money managers at
investing institutions.
   Strong earnings reports for the first quarter from many
industrial companies have prompted gains in individual issues,
without carrying much impact for the market as a whole.
   In Wednesday's trading, for instance, DuPont gained 1~ to 86].
The company reported higher first-quarter earnings and raised its
quarterly dividend from 85 to 95 cents a share.
   Union Carbide, another component of the Dow Jones industrial
average, rose ~ to 23} and led the active list on turnover of 2.4
million shares. The company said its results for the first half of
1988 will be better than had been expected.
   Ford Motor, which increased its projections for car and truck
production for the third quarter, added } to 47{.
   By contrast, Chrysler, which posted nearly flat first-quarter
profits before a one-time charge, lost [ to 23|.
   Western Savings & Loan jumped 1\ to 7|. The company denied
rumors that it might be a takeover candidate.
   Cadbury Schweppes climbed 6} to 67[ in the over-the-counter
market. General Cinema said it planned to seek approval to increase
its 17.7 percent stake in the company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.03 billion, or .08
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 162.78 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose .03 to 307.54, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was off .13 at 263.80.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained .83 to 378.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 301.16, down .29.

   Chrysler Corp.'s decision to delay closing
its Kenosha assembly plant will buy autoworkers and government
officials time to cope with what officials say ultimately will
amount to the biggest layoff in Wisconsin history.
   Chrysler said Wednesday it expects to close the 5,500-worker
Kenosha plant by the end of the year, later than originally
planned. The automaker also said it will continue building its
K-car in the United States during the car's phaseout.
   ``It's just outstanding news,'' said state representative Peter
Barca.
   Though state officials expressed hopes that the reprieve could
be the first in a series for the aged plant, Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca said the facility's days still are numbered.
   ``I do not want any more misunderstandings about Kenosha. It
will only delay the closing ... It will keep a full work force on
through year's end, and that's it,'' Iacocca said at a news
conference.
   He attributed the decision to keep the plant operating through
the end of the year to favorable market conditions and pressure
from Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and Congressman Les Aspin,
D-Wis.
   But Ed Steagall, president of United Auto Workers Local 72,
attributed the decision to UAW chief negotiator Marc Stepp's
insistence that Chrysler not forget the Kenosha workers.
   ``He saw to it that Kenosha was not just a bastard child but has
been put in with the rest of the Chrysler discussion,'' Steagall
said.
   Others speculated the outcry over Chrysler's announcement last
week that it would shift some auto production to Mexico so that the
Kenosha plant could close on schedule also played a role in the
decision.
   ``What this demonstrates is that Iacocca bends to public
pressure and public ridicule,'' state Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Strohl said. ``The state and the workers should keep up the public
pressure.''
   ``Their announcement of moving production to Mexico hit the
public like cold water early in the morning,'' Barca said. ``Public
relations has played a major part in all their decision-making over
the last six months.''
   Most officials are pragmatic about the delayed closing of the
plant.
   ``It allows the city of Kenosha a little more breathing room and
a chance for diversification,'' said Kenosha's mayor, Patrick Moran.
   The problem for the city will be finding new jobs for displaced
auto workers. In addition, officials say Kenosha needs time to
develop its industrial park, complete new business projects, expand
the local airport and compete for a dog track.
   ``We're still going to have a severe dislocation of a large
number of workers,'' state Labor Secretary John Coughlin said.
Combined, the one-two punch Chrysler had planned to deliver to
Kenosha in July and September would have been the biggest layoff in
state history, he said.
   Delaying the layoffs will pump an additional $63 million in
Chrysler payroll checks into Kenosha's economy, an assistant to
Coughlin said.
   The delay also will save the state $24 million in unemployment
compensation costs and between $3.9 million and $9.6 million in
welfare and social services costs, according to official estimates.

<HEAD>Primerica Says Volatile Markets Affected Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Primerica Corp., a financial services
and specialty retailing company, said Wednesday its income fell 20
percent in the first quarter, partly due to uncertainty in the
financial markets.
   Net income fell to $55.7 million, or 99 cents per share, from
$69.7 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier.
   Non-recurring gains from sales of the company's remaining
timberlands increased first-quarter after-tax income by $10.6
million, the company said. Previously reported non-recurring items
had raised income by $27.1 million in the comparable period a year
ago.
   Revenues during the 1988 first quarter totaled slightly more
than $1 billion, compared to $801 million in the same period last
year.
   ``Many of Primerica's businesses performed well during the first
quarter of 1988, and earnings also benefited from lower corporate
expenses,'' said Gerald Tsai Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The company said its insurance operations, its largest single
business group, posted a 15 percent increase in operating income
during the period. Operating income from financial services,
excluding investment banking and securities brokerage, dropped 12
percent due to lower mutual funds sales and mortgage closings.
Volatile markets and higher interest rates were to blame, the
company said.
   Operating income for specialty retailing businesses was up 12
percent, including strong results from Musicland Group.
   The company also said it was making progress in its efforts to
reduce debt and strengthen its financial position.
   Primerica, based in Greenwich, had 1987 revenues of $3.8 billion.

<HEAD>USAir Posts $18.8 Million Net Loss for First Quarter</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: new throughout to UPDATE with Southwest Airlines' earnings;
no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir Group Inc. on Wednesday reported a net
loss of $18.8 million for the first quarter, which the airline
company blamed on rising costs at one of its subsidiaries and a
decline in passenger traffic at another.
   In Dallas, Southwest Airlines reported a dramatic turnaround
based partly on the recovering Texas economy and the sale of an
unprofitable subsidiary.
   USAir Group, based in Arlington, Va., is the parent company of
USAir, Pacific Southwest Airlines, Piedmont Aviation, four commuter
airline subsidiaries, and a leasing and servicing subsidiary.
   The $18.8 million loss compared with a net profit of $23.5
million, or 80 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1987.
   The loss occurred despite an increase in first-quarter revenue,
to $1.2 billion from $464.9 million in the first three months of
1987.
   The company attributed the loss to an increase in the cost per
available seat mile at USAir, mainly due to higher fuel prices, and
to declining traffic at Pacific Southwest.
   ``The loss occurred during the January-February period and the
company's profitability resumed in March,'' said Edwin Colodny,
USAir Group chairman and president.
   Although the first-quarter results are disappointing, Colodny
said, the company is already seeing improvements at USAir and will
implement new schedule changes in May and June to improve service
in Pacific Southwest's former markets.
   The new services include nonstop flights from Pittsburgh and
Indianapolis to Las Vegas, and between Cleveland, Los Angeles and
San Francisco beginning May 2. The carrier will also offer new
nonstop service between Pittsburgh and Seattle starting in June.
   All of the new westbound services will continue on to other West
Coast cities, the first examples of ``link flying'' between the
eastern and western portions of the company's route network,
Colodny noted.
   Separately, Southwest Airlines reported net earnings of
$168,000, or 1 cent a share, compared with a loss of $9.8 million
in the first quarter of 1987.
   The company reported operating revenue of $178.5 million,
virtually unchanged from the $178.3 million reported in the
year-ago quarter.
   The carrier credited the improved earnings to a general
strengthening of the Texas economy and the sale of subsidiary
TranStar Airlines, which ceased operations in August. TranStar
contributed to Southwest's loss in 1987, company officials said.

   Nearly four years after Bhopal chemical
disaster, Union Carbide Corp. Chairman Robert D. Kennedy said
Wednesday that the chemical giant's business was good despite a
multimillion-dollar morass of litigation over the world's worst
industrial accident.
   ``We would like to resolve the situation and get much needed aid
to the victims, but we cannot accept the court's attempt to impose
legal liability without a trial, especially as the evidence is now
overwhelming that the tragedy was the result of a Union Carbide
India employees deliberate act of sabotage,'' Kennedy said during
the company's 70th annual meeting.
   He also said the company is spending between $7 million and $8
million annually on expenses from the Bhopal litigation.
   The leak of toxic gas on Dec. 31, 1984 came from a pesticide
plant run by the company's Indian subsidiary. The disaster killed
more than 2,800 people and and injured at least 20,000. The Indian
government sued Union Carbide in September 1986, contending the
leak was caused by negligence. The company has said it resulted
from sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   At the end of last year, Kennedy said the company offered an
out-of-court settlement of $350 million, which was rejected by the
Indian government.
   On April 4, the High Court in the central Indian state of Madhya
Pradesh ordered Union Carbide to pay $192 million in interim relief.
   Kennedy said Wednesday the company has 60 days to respond and it
has not decided yet whether it will appeal that order.
   Stockholders also approved a proposal to amend its policy that
limits the liability of directors. But one stockholder opposed the
propoal, saying it is ``very directly related to Bhopal,'' and
added, ``directors need to take personal responsibility for all
actions of the company.''
   Ward Morehouse Jr., who said he represents some Bhopal interest
groups, claimed that ``Carbide moved heaven and earth to transfer
the case to India,'' and said he hopes the company now ``will not
seek refuge in U.S. courts.''
   Another shareholder asked Kennedy what the company means when it
says it has accepted ``moral responsibility'' for the tragedy.
   ``Union Carbide has accepted moral responsibility. I don't know
why we have to explain that,'' Kennedy said.
   He said since the day after the accident the company has tried
to do everything it could to resolve the issue. ``But we have been
literally bulldozed by the government of India and years later, no
court has heard testimony,'' he said.
   Kennedy also said that the company is lean and healthy now. He
said debt is manageable and its goal is to ``bring the ratio of
debt to capitalization below 60 percent within a few years.'' He
also said earnings for the full year may be closer to $3 per share
rather than earlier expectations in the $2.40 range.
   In other matters, Union Carbide shareholders rejected a proposal
to withdraw from white-minority ruled South Africa.

<HEAD>Chrysler First-Quarter Earnings Off Nearly 32 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf to UPDATE with figures for second half; picks

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Wednesday that
its first quarter profit fell about 32 percent from a year ago due
to a one-time charge for planned plant closings.
   The nation's third largest automaker netted $183.7 million, or
83 cents a share, on revenue of $7.8 billion in the first three
months of 1988. That compared with earnings of $269.4 million, or
$1.24, and $6.01 billion in revenue last year.
   Without the plant-closings charge, totaling, $150.2 million,
Chrysler said it would have earned $276.8 million, or $1.25 a
share, in the first quarter.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca said the company's earnings also were
affected by a decision to hold down prices to increase Chrysler's
share of the U.S. vehicle market.
   ``We actually cut prices on 42 percent of the 1988 models we
sell, and we've held overall price increases to about 3 percent
over the last three years,'' Iacocca said. ``We've matched or
bettered everybody on incentives.''
   Iacocca said the strategy has resulted in a decision to increase
production in 1988. It also has boosted Chrysler's share of the
U.S. car and truck market, including sales of imported vehicles, to
14.5 percent in the first quarter from 13.5 percent a year ago with
the company's highest quarterly sales in 15 years.
   Chrysler announced a second increase in planned 1988 production
in a move that will delay until year's end the closing of a
5,500-worker former American Motors Corp. plant and prevent, at
least temporarily, transfer of K-car assembly work from Detroit to
Toluca, Mexico.
   Iacocca said Chrysler was increasing production by 110,000
vehicles in the second half of 1988. That represents a 12.6 percent
boost to a total of 983,000 vehicles.
   Earlier this year, Chrysler restored 56,000 vehicles to 1988
production schedules, which had been trimmed in expectation of slow
sales following the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   ``Our customers seem to be happy. They must like our products. I
guess they like our prices, because they're buying at a faster clip
by far than we predicted just 60 days ago,'' Iacocca said.
   Chrysler had planned to move production of the Omni-Horizon from
Kenosha to Detroit's Jefferson Avenue plant in July, shifting its
K-car from Detroit to Mexico for 1989 phase-out production. A plant
in Newark, Del., which also builds K-cars is being converted to
produce a K-car replacement.
   That announcement, along with executive bonuses released last
week, brought tension to talks between Chrysler and United Auto
Workers union negotiators working on a national contract.
   But Wednesday, Iacocca said Chrysler will build the Omni-Horizon
at Kenosha until January along with the Plymouth Gran Fury, Dodge
Diplomat and Chrysler Fifth Avenue. In January, Chrysler will move
the Omni-Horizon to Detroit, discontinue the other cars and shift
K-car production to Mexico if the cars are still selling well.
   Most of the increase in production will come from keeping the
Kenosha and Detroit plants running at full capacity through
January, Iacocca said.
   During the first quarter, Chrysler said, its share of the U.S.
truck market rose to 19.1 percent from 17.5 percent a year ago, due
partly to increased Jeep production following Chrysler's August
1987 purchase of AMC.
   Chrysler said its share of the U.S. car market also rose
slightly in the first quarter from a year ago.
   In March, Chrysler backed down from the attempted sale of its
28,000-worker Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary but said it would close
four Acustar plants if it couldn't sell them within 18 months. The
four plants _ three in Detroit and one in Van Wert, Ohio _ together
employ about 2,000 workers.
   Chrysler previously had announced plans to close Acustar plants
in Indianapolis and Sarnia, Ontario.
   In the first quarter, General Motors Corp. said its earnings
rose 18 percent to $1.09 billion, or $3.11 a share, on sales of
$26.44 billion from $922.5 million, or $2.62 a share, on sales of
$26.1 billion a year ago.
   However, GM's first-quarter earnings would have fallen 6 percent
without a one-time accounting change that added $224.2 million, or
70 cents a share.
   Ford Motor Co., the most profitable automaker in 1986 and 1987,
is scheduled to report first quarter earnings Thursday.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Rise On Expectations Of Oil Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for gold, silver and platinum posted solid gains
Wednesday on expectations that OPEC members would agree on a plan
to reduce exports of crude oil, analysts said.
   On other markets, energy futures retreated; livestock and meat
futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans were mixed, and
stock-index futures fell.
   Analysts said the metals markets were primed for a technical
rally. And reports that seven independent oil-producing countries
had offered to cut their oil exports if OPEC would do the same
provided an impetus for the surge.
   The oil-rich countries hope a drop in exports will reduce world
supplies enough to force oil prices higher. Because higher oil
prices would be viewed as inflationary, investment demand for
precious metals also could increase.
   The non-OPEC nations made their offer of a 5 percent cut in
exports contingent on the 13 members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreeing to a reduce their exports by
the same amount.
   OPEC ministers were to meet Thursday in Vienna to discuss the
offer. Reports of disagreement among OPEC members, especially
between Saudi Arabia and Iran, caused oil futures to drop sharply
late in the day, but the metals ``ignored that completely,'' said
Bette Raptopoulos, metals analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   ``The metals are anticipating that the OPEC talks will continue
in a positive vein tomorrow,'' she said.
   Technical data suggested the metals rally would continue, said
Richard Levine, vice president of the precious metals and foreign
exchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Silver futures made an especially sharp move upward because,
Levine said, the recent lack of volatility in the silver market had
made it overdue for a strong move in either direction.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold settled $2.50 to $3
higher with the contract for delivery in June at $454.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 11.9 cents higher with May at $6.50
a troy ounce. Platinum gained $6.50 across the board on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, with July settling at $526.20 a troy
ounce.
   Skepticism about an oil-export cut sparked a heavy round of late
selling in the energy futures pits at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   ``I think a lot of people are anticipating there's a chance that
OPEC will not agree to cut back on production,'' said Andrew Lebow,
energy analyst with E.D.& F. Man International Futures Inc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 26 cents to 33 cents
lower with June at $18.27 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cent to .49
cent lower with May at 51.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.06 cent to 1 cent lower with May at 52.36 cents a gallon.
   Higher cash prices linked to stronger demand supported livestock
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, said Philip Stanley, an
analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Frozen pork bellies advanced on technical strength and
expectations for a seasonal increase in demand, he said.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.17 cents higher with June at
71.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .52 cent to .90 cent higher
with April at 80.75 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .65 cent
higher with June at 49.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.47 cent to 1.15 cents higher with May at 52.67 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade with much of the selling due to profit-taking after Tuesday's
sharp rise in soybean prices.
   Soybeans finished mixed to lower following the Agriculture
Department's denial of reports it had predicted unexpectedly large
reductions in crop acreage under a government price-support program.
   But the selling pressure was offset by light commission house
and fund buying, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybeans also got a boost from reports of rainy weather slowing
the Brazilian soybean harvest, which is more than half complete.
   Corn was fractionally higher. Wheat retreated slightly on
profit-taking.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 1{ cents lower with May at $3.10{ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to } cent higher with May at $2.01 a
bushel; oats were 1\ cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $1.67 a
bushel; soybeans were 1} cents lower to 3 cents higher with May at
$6.75} a bushel.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .80 point lower at 264.

<HEAD>Shell Earnings Up on Accounting Change; Amerada Hess Earnings Fall
64 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Shell Oil Co. said Wednesday its earnings soared during the
first quarter due to an accounting change while Amerada Hess Corp.
said its earnings tumbled 64 percent.
   Shell, based in Houston, said it earned $1.2 billion in the
first three months of the year, compared to $108 million in the
same period a year earlier. Shell does not release per-share
figures because the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Royal
Dutch Shell, based in the Netherlands.
   The latest quarter included a one-time $900 million adjustment
for a new financial accounting standard for income taxes.
   The company's income from operations more than tripled, to $345
million from $108 million.
   ``Earnings increased in all major segments, especially in our
oil and chemical products businesses,'' said Shell President John
F. Bookout.
   Revenue rose to $5 billion from $4.5 billion.
   Amerada Hess, based in New York, said it earned $65.6 million,
or 80 cents per share, down from $181.5 million, or $2.15 per
share, in the first three months of last year.
   Revenue rose to $1.26 billion from $1.23 billion.
   The company did not give any explanation for its earnings
decline.

   Adolphe Alfred Rempp, creator of
Adolph's Meat Tenderizer and owner of several restaurants, has died
at home. He was 77.
   Rempp, who died Tuesday, was born in San Francisco, where he
started his restaurant career at age 22 as a chef.
   Finding conventional liquid meat tenderizers too difficult to
handle, Rempp developed his own powdered tenderizer in 1935, said
Leah Rempp, his wife of 25 years. He marketed his Adolph's Meat
Tenderizer nationwide and earned millions.
   Rempp owned restaurants in the Los Angeles area and in San
Francisco, where he operated the Sailing Ship, an actual 1908
Danish vessel he bought from a movie company that had used it as a
prop, Mrs. Rempp said.
   Rempp suffered from diabetes. Last year, his right leg was
amputated above the knee.
   Besides his wife, survivors include three sons; two daughters;
two stepdaughters; a stepson, and seven grandchidren.
   Rempp, who had a lifelong love of ships and the oceans, will be
cremated and buried at sea in a private ceremony.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Trade Bill, But Not by Enough To Overcome Veto</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 3 grafs after 2nd graf pvs to UPDATE with Reagan
comments and include major provisions of the bill</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved a sweeping trade bill,
63-36, on Wednesday and sent it to the White House, but supporters
failed to muster the two-thirds support needed to override a
threatened presidential veto.
   ``I believe that this bill is dead,'' Sen. John C. Danforth,
R-Mo., said after the vote. But he and other supporters said a more
moderate version still had a chance of passage later this year if
President Reagan's veto is sustained.
   Reagan, who has vowed repeatedly to veto the bill unless his
objections were met, was asked what he planned to do with the
measure as he greeted Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for a
state dinner at the White House.
   ``Just what I promised,'' he replied.
   Some of the bill's major provisions would require the
administration to retaliate against unfair trading practices by
other nations and streamline procedures for imposing curbs on
imports.
   Sponsors said the bill's main downfall was a plan to require
employers to give notice of plant closings and major layoffs.
Danforth said trying to carry the bill in the Senate with that
feature ``was like swimming the English Channel and you get about a
mile out and someone hands you a 500-pound barbell and says, here,
carry this.''
   Democratic leaders also were unable to unsnarl a dispute over
the bill's curbs on Alaskan oil exports and thus failed in an
effort to win over that state's disgruntled Republican senators. In
the end, 11 Republicans defied the White House and voted for the
measure.
   One Democrat voted against the bill, retiring Sen. William
Proxmire of Wisconsin, who said he was concerned over the bill's
easing of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   The White House itself brought heavy lobbying pressure to head
off any recurrence of last week's defeat in the House, where the
measure passed by more than a veto-proof margin. Most wavering
Republicans ended up opposing the bill.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary B.J. Cooper said that ``based
on today's vote, the numbers are there'' to sustain a veto, but
added, ``We will continue working with both houses to make sure
that when the veto goes up that it is sustained.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter said: ``I am
encouraged by today's Senate vote and optimistic that the
president's veto of the omnibus trade bill will be sustained.'' But
he added that it ``would be tragic'' if lawmakers did not try for a
more moderate version.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, told
reporters he would work to override the president's veto. But he
said it was ``obvious that the odds are against us.''
   He said any new version of the bill would have to be very much
like the current one but with the plant-closings provision and
perhaps the Alaskan oil export curbs removed.
   One wavering Republican who supported the bill the first time
around, Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb., went to the White House and met
for 30 minutes with President Reagan, Vice President Bush, chief of
staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and
Energy Secretary Donald Hodel.
   He emerged from the session expressing concern over duty-free
imports of ethanol from the Caribbean and saying ``what I needed
was the president's assurance that the administration was going to
introduce another bipartisan bill that could be quickly passed by
the Congress and signed.''
   ``And I think he has done that,'' Karnes said.
   Before the vote, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., urged his
colleagues to turn a deaf ear to ``the Japanese trade minister
whining and complaining about'' the 1,000-page measure produced by
a House-Senate conference committee.
   ``He has no justification to say one word about because they
have been cheating from A to Z in international trading with us for
years,'' Riegle said.
   Reagan renewed his veto threat and promised to work later for a
milder version in a letter Tuesday to Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan.
   Reagan called on lawmakers to ``finish the trade bill process in
a way that serves America's interests _ not the special interests.''
   Most administration fire has been directed at a provision that
would require all but the smallest companies to provide their
employees with 60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale
layoffs.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., defended the embattled
plant-closings provision, saying 40,000 plants have shut down in
this decade of increased foreign competition.
   ``Nearly 2 million people have lost their jobs each year,''
Kennedy said. ``Yet the administration does not want workers to
know their jobs are in danger and to have time to plan for new ways
to provide for their families.''
   The administration dangled the prospect of a slimmed down
version of the bill, minus the plant-closings and perhaps other
provisions, once Congress has sustained Reagan's expected veto of
the current measure.
   But Democratic leaders said this could be the last chance to
support trade legislation before the fall election campaign.
   The House passed the bill last Thursday, 312-107, more than
enough to override a veto.
   The bill would overhaul the system under which the United States
imposes import curbs and takes other steps to retaliate against
international trade violations and other unfair practices.
   Authority to retaliate would be transferred from the president
to the U.S. trade representative. Retaliation would be mandatory
but the bill provides five broadly phrased exceptions, such as
threats to national security.
   Main provisions also streamline the means by which the United
States imposes import restrictions to protect American businesses
threatened by surges in import competition.
   But the 1,000-page measure contains hundreds of additional
provisions, ranging from billions of dollars in agricultural
subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil companies.
   Government aid to workers left jobless by import competition
would be expanded. Trade sanctions would be imposed on Japan's
Toshiba Corp., one of its subsidiaries and the Norwegian company of
Kongsberg Vapenfabrikk for sale of submarine silencing equipment to
the Soviet Union.
   The measure would assist Americans in defending themselves
against bribery charges brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act because of payments made by their agents overseas. It would
ease some export curbs on high-tech equipment subject to
restriction because of its potential military uses.
   A maze of minor provisions governs trade in everything from
cranberries to cantaloupes.
   Several Republicans have expressed irritation at the
administration's heavy focus on the plant-closings provision as the
reason to oppose the bill.
   ``It puts Republicans on the side, at least the perception out
there, of being against the poor working man and women who get only
four-day notice,'' Dole said.

<HEAD>Max Feldberg, Zayre Corp. Co-Founder, Dies At 90</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Max Feldberg, a co-founder of the pioneering Zayre
discount department store chain, has died following a long illness,
the company announced Wednesday. He was 90.
   Feldberg, who died Tuesday, and his brother Morris launched the
first Zayre stores in Boston and Hyannis in 1956. They guided the
growth of Zayre Corp. into one of the nation's biggest retail
chains, with 1,187 outlets in 43 states and the District of
Columbia.
   Zayre _ a phonetic spelling of the Yiddish word meaning
``very,'' as in ``very good'' _ is the company's flagship business.
Zayre Corp. also operates T.J. Maxx, Hit or Miss, Chadwick's of
Boston, BJ's Wholesale Club and HomeClub.
   A company statement released Wednesday did not give a cause of
Feldberg's death. Company officials could not be reached for
comment Wednesday night at Zayre headquarters.
   The Feldberg brothers were born in Russia but fled to the United
States in the early 1900s to escape conscription in the czar's army
and settled in Chelsea, Mass., with their mother.
   Feldberg, who attended Northeastern University and served with
the U.S. Navy in World War I, and his brother began a small hosiery
business in Chelsea in 1919. The business later branched out with
the acquistion of retail apparel chains in New England and greater
New York.
   Recognizing the trends toward suburban living, the brothers were
among the first to open self-service, discount stores outside the
downtown retail areas. Following Morris Feldberg's death in 1969,
``Mr. Max'' served as Zayre chairman until 1973, when he assumed
the title of honorary chairman. In 1985, directors named him
chairman emeritus of the Framingham-based company.
   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; their two children,
Stanley Feldberg and Barbara Stern; six grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.
   Funeral services will be held Friday in Brookline.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Consent Decrees On All-Terrain Vehicles</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf pvs bgng, `But Gesell,' to INCLUDE judge's full
name, title</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Wednesday approved with
several modifications proposed consent decrees to regulate
all-terrain vehicles blamed for nearly 1,000 deaths and 300,000
injuries in the last five years.
   The settlement between the Consumer Product Safety Commission
and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and
lawmakers as not providing adequate protection or compensation for
owners of the vehicles known as ATVS.
   But U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said: ``No decree
designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far in meeting
such a massive national consumer problem.''
   The settlement was approved after the judge persuaded attorneys
for the CPSC and the manufacturers to agree to several changes in
the order that satisfy objections he made at an April 18 hearing.
   The revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed
the CPSC to initiate a general recall only if it found ``new and
substantial evidence'' that the vehicles were hazardous.
   It also bars the CPSC from initiating a so-called generic recall
of ATVs before Dec. 31, 1990. The original decree empowered the
agency to take such action a year after the agreement received
court approval.
   CPSC general counsel James V. Lacy said the change ``clarifies
the evidentiary standard but provides a longer period of time to
allow the agreement to work.''
   The elimination of the ``substantial evidence'' wording was
hailed by Katherine Meyer, an attorney who represented a variety of
consumer and health groups, including the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association.
   ``Under the decree as it was previously written, the CPSC could
not do anything further unless it came up with new and substantial
evidence'' of safety hazards, Meyer said. Such a standard
``excluded a failure to reduce deaths and injuries.''
   ``It was a major problem we had with the decree,'' she said.
   The consent decrees between the commission and the five
manufacturers bans the sale of three-wheel ATVs unless the
manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by
the CPSC.
   It also requires warning labels on four-wheel models.
Distributors must prvide training in the safe use of all types of
ATVs to owners who purchased the vehicles after Dec. 30. 1986.
   It also requires the manufacturers to spend $8.5 million to warn
consumers about the hazards of ATVs and promote the training.
   There are an estimated 2.4 million ATVs in use in this country,
including 1.5 million three-wheel models.
   CPSC chairman Terrence M. Scanlon said in a statement that he
was ``personally gratified that the federal district court agreed
that the commission's all-terrain vehicle settlement is in the
public interest,''
   ``Had the consent decree not been signed, years of protracted
and uncertain litigation would have followed,'' he said.
   ``With nearly 1,000 ATV-related deaths and more than 300,000
hospital emergency room injuries already recorded _ many to
children under 16 _ such a delay would have come at an unacceptably
high cost,'' he said.
   Critics, including members of Congress and the attorneys general
of 32 states, contended the agreement was flawed because it didn't
require the manufacturers to give owners a refund for ATVs they
decided they no longer wanted.
   ``The settlement is only a beginning because it fails to include
any real remedy for the million and a half people who are stuck
with especially hazardous three-wheel ATVs,'' Rep. James Florio,
D-N.J., said in a statement.
   Florio is sponsoring legislation that would require
manufacturers to make refunds.
   Ms. Meyer said that although the groups she represents ``are
pleased about the decree'' they will continue to lobby Congress to
enact a refund bill.
   Another modification requires the distributors to require
dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of
the hazards, specifically to children, of ATVs and to ensure the
vehicles bear the required safety labels.
   The original decree had required the manufacturers to make their
``best efforts'' to get the dealers to implement these requirements.
   Other changes include a requirement that CPSC maintain a central
repository of consumer complaints and other reports to enable the
public and the agency to determine how the consent decree is
working.
   The agency's general counsel is also required to make a public
filing to explain why he has granted any extensions in compliance
deadlines that are longer than six weeks.
   One consent decree is with four Japanese firms and their
American divisions _ Honda Motor Co. Ltd, Yamaha Motor Co. LTD,
Susuki Motors Co. LTD. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries LTD. The other
decree is with Polaris Industries, a U.S.-based manufacturer.

   Americans' personal incomes, boosted by
profit-sharing payments in the auto industry, posted the biggest
gain last month since December, while consumer spending jumped a
healthy 0.7 percent, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said personal incomes climbed 0.8
percent in March after a 0.6 percent gain in February. It was the
best increase since an identical 0.8 percent advance in December.
   Analysts said spending and income figures showed that the
consumer, who cut back on purchases immediately following the
October stock market crash, had rebounded and was continuing to
propel overall economic growth.
   The report had little impact in the financial markets, however,
as stock prices rose slightly, bond prices slipped and the dollar
edged lower.
   But oil prices ended lower after trading erratically on
speculation about the outcome of a meeting between OPEC and
independent oil exporters. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
June-delivery contract for West Texas Intermediate crude fell 33
cents a barrel to $18.27.
   In reporting Tuesday on the gross national product, the
government said the consumer was the biggest source of strength
during the first three months of the year. Consumer spending rose
at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation,
during the quarter.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, had declined by 2.5 percent in the final three
months of 1987, raising fears that if Americans stopped spending,
especially for big-ticket items, the nation could be pushed into a
recession.
   ``There is no serious consumer retrenchment going on. People are
still willing to buy,'' said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the
Futures Group, an economic forecasting firm in Washington. ``We
shouldn't face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest
of the year.''
   Ms. Shaber predicted that consumer spending would rise at a
modest 2 percent annual rate for the entire year, about the same as
in 1987.
   The 0.8 percent March increase in incomes would have been a much
smaller 0.2 percent if special factors including an annual bonus
for auto workers had been excluded.
   The average $2,500 payment to 108,000 Ford Motor Co. employees
accounted for more than half of the increase in wages and salaries
last month, which rose 0.5 percent in March, the government said.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass., said that with unemployment now at a nine-year low of 5.6
percent, the modest increase in wages for the month was good news.
He said it showed the economy is not beginning to see inflationary
pressures from rising wage demands.
   ``Wages are rising at an annual rate of about 2.5 percent to 3
percent, which is still low by historical standards,'' Wyss said.
   In all, personal incomes rose $29.6 billion to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.92 trillion. Personal consumption
spending, which includes virtually everything except interest
payments on debt, rose $21.8 billion to an annual rate of $3.09
trillion.
   Disposable, or after-tax, incomes were up as well, climbing 0.6
percent in March following a 0.8 percent February increase.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, dipped slightly last month to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent
in February, although both months showed an improvement from the
3.7 percent average savings rate in 1987.
   The spending advance came in the categories of non-durable goods
and services. Durable goods, items such as cars that are expected
to last at least three years, edged down $300 million during March
after a huge $9.2 billion rise in February.
   But purchases of non-durable goods were up $9.8 billion while
purchases of services, which include housing costs, rose $12.2
billion.

<TEXT>
   A security sweep has revealed a
``state-of-the-art'' wiretap on the office telephone used by the
head of the Eastern Airlines pilots union, the union said Wednesday.
   It was the third such discovery in 1{ years, said Ron Cole, a
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, who refused to
speculate on the origin of the bug.
   ``At this point in time I think it would be premature for us to
make any accusations,'' Cole told the Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   Cole would not identify the security firm that found the
wiretap, described as an electronic board about 2 inches long and
by 1 inch wide.
   Coral Gables police Sgt. M. Ginn said Wednesday that his
department received a complaint about a wiretap at ALPA
headquarters earlier this week.
   FBI agent Al Lamanna in Miami said his office had not received
any report of the ALPA wiretap.
   Duty officers at the Tallahassee and the Miami offices of the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement said they didn't know if
their agency was involved in the investigation.
   ``These are troubled times at our airline,'' Cole said in a news
release. ``Industrial espionage such as this only serves to
heighten the stress.''
   Facing a possible strike by its Machinists union, the largest of
the three unions at Miami-based Eastern, management at the
financially-troubled carrier held secret contract talks with ALPA
that broke off earlier this month.
   Eastern and its owner, Texas Air Corp., are under government
scrutiny over safety and management practices. Earlier this month,
Eastern was fined $823,500 for safety infractions and the Federal
Aviation Administration undertook plane-by-plane inspections of
Eastern and of Continental Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary.
   The latest bug was found attached to the main rotary line at the
Coral Gables headquarters of ALPA last week during a routine
periodic electronic security check, the union stated. It was found
on the line most frequently used by Jack Bavis, chairman of the
ALPA local, Cole said.
   ``The sophisticated parasitic transmitter device had the
capability to be accessed with a radio receiver up to several
hundred feet away from the building,'' the release said.
   The bug was left in place until Tuesday so the telephone company
could check it out, Cole said. Security experts could not determine
how long it had been there, he added.
   Bugs were discovered in November 1986 in a phone in the
chairman's office and on two other phones, the release stated.
   Two months ago, a security sweep also found a listening device
attached to the table used by the pilots group chairman at a hotel
meeting of the pilots union leadership. At that meeting, labor
officials were discussing possible buy-out plans of Eastern by
employee groups.
   Cole said investigations of those buggings were continuing.
