   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen won by acclamation the
Democratic vice-presidential nomination Thursday and said he and
Michael Dukakis ``have differences ... but stand united'' on basic
party principles and their determination to regain control of the
White House.
   There was a thunderous ovation as Dukakis, his wife Kitty,
Bentsen and his wife Beryl Ann held hands and acknowledged the
crowd at the evening's climactic moment after Dukakis' own
acceptance speech. The band played patriotic music and the
delegates held small American flags aloft.
   Jesse Jackson and his wife Jackie later joined the group on
stage, as did some of Dukakis' other defeated rivals.
   Bentsen was the choice of the Massachusetts governor and won
Jackson's written endorsement just as his name was being entered in
nomination.
   Still, when the voice vote was taken to acclaim him the nominee,
many Jackson supporters shouted ``no,'' voicing their continued
displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the ticket.
Fifteen members of Bentsen's Texas delegation refused to join in
the celebration.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, the convention chairman, declared the
nomination approved by a two-thirds vote, and Dukakis and Bentsen
signs were thrust into the air. The signs changed to
``Dukakis-Bentsen'' before the new vice-presidential nominee could
finish his acceptance speech.
   Bentsen, in accepting the nomination, attempted to portray the
contrasts between him and the more liberal Dukakis as good for the
ticket.
   ``We Democrats do not march in lockstep behind some narrow,
rigid ideology,'' he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the
Democratic National Convention. ``We are not gray grains of oatmeal
in a bland porridge of privilege.''
   ``Of course we have differences of opinion,'' Bentsen said in an
oblique reference to the fact that he and the presidential nominee
disagree on many issues.
   ``But on the basic issues of justice and opportunity, we stand
united,'' he said.
   In a sharp attack on the Reagan-Bush administration, Bentsen
said, ``America has just passed through the ultimate epoch of
illusion, an eight-year coma in which slogans were confused with
solutions.''
   Dukakis, in his own remarks, paid tribute to Bentsen, saying he
would speak up if the National Security Council came up with the
``cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages.''
   ``We're going to have a vice president named Lloyd Bentsen who
will walk into the Oval Office and say, `Mr. President, this is
outrageous. It's got to stop.''' The crowd cheered.
   Jackson supporters had threatened earlier this week to place
Jackson's name in nomination for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. But
the Dukakis and Jackson camps resolved their differences and no
nomting petition was filed.
   Jackson's last-minute statement in support of the Texan said:
``While I may disagree with both Governor Dukakis and Senator
Bentsen on some important issues, our interests converge in
building a coalition to beat the Republicans this fall.''
   Some in the audience chanted ``No Contra aid'' as he started to
speak, and a smattering of ``No Contra aid'' signs were sprinkled
throughout the audience. Bentsen has supported U.S. assistance to
the Nicaraguan rebels, which Dukakis opposes.
   After his speech, Bentsen was joined on the podium by his
family, including his 94-year-old father Lloyd. He and his wife
embraced and waved to the crowd, which clapped along with the Air
Force Hymn. They held up ``beat Bush Again'' signs and chanted that
refrain. Bentsen first won election to the Senate in 1970 by
defeating Bush.
   Bentsen, 67, made a bid for the presidential nomination in 1976,
then stayedin the Senate, two years ago becoming chairman of the
powerful Senate Finance Committee. He has since shepherded through
his panel some of the legislative initiatives the Democrats plan to
brag about this fall _ welfare reform, Medicare insurance for
catastrophic illness, and the trade bill including a 60-day advance
notice for plant closings.
   Bentsen was nominated by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and
former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas and Sen. Tom Daschle of South
Dakota seconded the nomination.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen has everything it takes to become one of
America's great vice presidents,'' Rostenkowski said. ``Lloyd
Bentsen is straightforward, Lloyd Bentsen is smart and, yes, Lloyd
Bentsen is tough. He knows that compromise keeps the political
process running.''
   Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, who was considered by many a more
likely choice for Dukakis, introduced Bentsen to the convention.
   ''You want to know something,'' he said. ``To get to the Senate
in 1970, Lloyd Bentsen beat George Bush. And this November, he and
Michael Dukakis will do it again.''
   Many of Bentsen's public events in his four days in Atlanta
prior to his nomination were aimed at soothing the Democrats who
had hoped Dukakis would pick someone else.
   Bentsen is more conservative than Dukakis and many Democrats on
many issues, including his support of school prayer, the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua and his opposition to gun control.
   But his acceptance speech was crafted to highlight something
nearly all the Democrats agree upon _ beating the Republicans.
   ``The Reagan-Bush administration likes to talk about prosperity.
But the farmers in Iowa don't hear them,'' he said. ``The oil field
workers in Texas and Oklahoma and Louisiana don't hear them. The
factory workers in John Glenn's Ohio don't hear them.''
   The first stop for the new Democratic ticket upon leaving
Atlanta Friday will be Bentsen's hometown of McAllen, Texas.
   Meanwhile, spokesmen for Bentsen said that past campaign
literature exaggerating the number of missions he had flown in
World War II had been corrected a few years ago.
   Official biographies put out during earlier campaigns say that
as a B-24 bomber pilot based in Italy, ``Bentsen flew 50 bomber
missions over Europe during the war.'' But Air Force records show
that he flew 35 combat missions, according pan Air Force spokesman
in Washington, Maj. Lou Figeroa.
   Jack Devore, Bentsen's press secretary, said he is not sure how
the incorrect number worked its way into the official biographies,
but that Bentsen had noticed the mistake ``a few years ago'' and
that subsequent campaign literature did not mention a specific
number of flights.

   Federal Border Patrol agents arrested two
Colombian nationals and seized about 1,680 pounds of cocaine from a
rental truck during a routine check at a turnpike gate Thursday,
officials said.
   The seizure, not a record nationally but by far the largest in
state history, was valued at $53 million, said Mario Ortiz,
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Dallas.
   Two men, ages 25 and 27, were in custody, Ortiz said.
   John Coonce, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office
in Tulsa, said the names of the arrested men would not be released
before Friday so their identities could be confirmed.
   Ortiz said the cocaine was in 14 boxes in the truck, which was
otherwise loaded with new furniture.
   The catch was a victory for the Miami Border Patrol office,
which the INS had sought to close by mid-1988 in a budget-cutting
move. At the insistence of the state's congressional delegation,
the office was kept open with rotating agents from bordering
states, mostly to look for illegal aliens.
   Agents Thursday would not provide details of the cocaine's
suspected origin or destination.
   Authorities reported confiscating 18,744 pounds of cocaine along
the U.S.-Mexican border in fiscal 1987, and 3,589 pounds in one
record overland Customs seizure on Sept. 14, 1987.
   The largest previous cocaine seizure in Oklahoma was in
September 1985, when agents staked out a Cessna 421 in Oklahoma
City and seized nearly 725 pounds of cocaine.

<TEXT>
   A psychologist who contended that the
1942 Walt Disney classic ``Bambi'' may be too upsetting for some
very young children to watch says she didn't expect her comments to
create such a stir.
   ``I don't have a vendetta against Bambi. I really don't give a
darn. It was just my ersonal opinion,'' Louise Bates Ames,
associate director of the Gesell Institute of Human Development,
said Wednesday.
   Ames, who for 25 years wrote a syndicated column on child
behavior, told USA Today last week that she personally would not
take a child 5 years or younger to see the G-rated animated movie,
which has drawn large audiences since its recent re-release.
   For very young children, ``possibly their worst fear is they
would lose their mother, or father,'' she said.
   That is exactly what happens to Bambi, the young deer and prince
of the forest whose mother dies off-screen at the hands of a hunter.
   ``It's a movie in which a child loses its mother and there is no
resolution. The mother (is just) gone,'' she said.``I felt it would
be too hard for many children.''
   Howard Green, a Disney spokesman in Burbank, Calif., said the
film contains many moral lessons about life and man's relationship
to animals which ``outweigh any possible complaints'' anyone might
have.
   ``Clearly the film is one of the most respected and critically
acclaimed of all animated films,'' Green said. ``Children have been
seeing it since 1942 and I don't think any damage has been done.
   ``Every Disney film has an element of fright to it, which makes
them so powerful and emotionally involving,'' he added.
   After the newspaper article appeared, Ames said she was
bombarded with telephone calls from all over the country.
   ``The personal calls were from parents who agreed with me,'' she
said. A Boston rabbi who is an authority on how children relate to
dying also was quoted as saying it might be harmful for very young
children to watch the film.
   Some Bambi fans objected, however. Ames participated in a radio
call-in show from Phoenix, during which she received several angry
calls.
   ``One man from New York was very angry. `What do you know about
all this?' he asked. I said this is not a big issue on my mind. I
don't really care,'' Ames said.
   Some callers said that because a deer and not a human died, the
film provides a way to introduce children more gently to the topic
of death.
   But Ames said a young child will not depersonalize the film. ``A
mom is a mom,'' she said.
   Green countered that the death of Bambi's mother is an example
of ``classic understatement. You hear a shot but you don't see
anything.''
   When Bambi realizes his mother has not returned home with him
after telling him to run, it is left to his father to tell him what
happened. The father tells Bambi that his mother won't be with him
any more because man has taken her away.
   Green said the sixth re-issue of ``Bambi'' produced the second
biggest opening last weekend for an animated Disney re-issue _ $7.2
million.

   Leftist guerrillas freed former
presidential candidate Alvaro Gomez Hurtado on Wednesday night 53
days after kidnapping him. He said he was unharmed.
   Gomez Hurtado arrived in a taxi at his home in northern Bogota
at 8:15 p.m. (9:15 p.m. EDT), Radio Caracol reported. Hundreds of
people gathered at the house to greet him.
   ``The episode of my kidnapping has been a confirmation that we
are living in difficult times and that it is necessary to look for
reconciliation among Colombians,'' Gomez Hurtado told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview shortly after his release.
   Gomez Hurtado, 69, a former ambassador to the United States, was
kidnapped May 29 by four men armed with submachine guns. His
bodyguard was killed.
   The leftist guerrilla group April 19 Movement, or M-19, claimed
responsibility. Early in the abduction, Gomez Hurtado was reported
to have been fatally wounded.
   However, Gomez Hurtado denied that he had been wounded when he
was abducted. He said the only physical problem he encountered
during his captivity was a stomach ailment.
   ``I was treated well, and when I needed any medicine, it was
given to me without delay,'' he said.
   Shown on television shortly after his release, he appeared to be
in good health.
   He said he was released on the edge of the city, where he had
hailed a taxi.
   Gomez Hurtado, son of former President Laureano Gomez, was a
presidential candidate for the Conservative Party in the 1986
elections, running against President Virgilio Barco Vargas of the
Liberal Party, who won.
   He also is publisher of the daily El Siglo and has said in many
editorials that he wants to see Colombia free of leftist guerrillas.
   Leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads and powerful drug
traffickers have been active in Colombia, kidnapping and killing
public officials in the last five years.
   Gomez Hurtado was kidnapped as he left a Bogota church across
the street from the British Embassy. Four men fired submachine
guns, wounding the bodyguard 14 times, and pushed Gomez Hurtado
into a vehicle that sped away.
   In a communique released July 14 in Panama City, the M-19 said
it would release Gomez Hurtado. The communique, read by Papal
Nuncio Jose Sebastian Laboa, came after five hours of negotiations
in the Vatican Embassy in the Panamanian capital.
   It said the decision had been made ``in the spirit of finding
routes that lead to a more equitable society, to the preservation
of human rights and reconciliation among Colombians.''

<HEAD>Scientists Advance Search for Gene Causing Crippling Disease</HEAD>

   Scientists reported today they had found the
approximate location of a gene that causes a crippling disease in
as many as 20,000 Americans.
   The work is a step toward earlier diagnosis of the illness,
Friedreich's ataxia, and toward detection of healthy people who
unknowingly carry the gene and can pass it to their offspring, the
researchers said.
   Scientists hope to isolate the gene as a clue to possible
treatments. The disease now has no cure or specific treatment.
   The study was reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by researchers at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in
London, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of
Utah School of Medicine, and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm,
Sweden.
   Friedreich's ataxia afflicts probably 15,000 to 20,000 people in
the United States, but no reliable statistics are available, said
Donald Wood of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which helped
finance the research.
   The life-threatening disease causes reduced muscle coordination
and an irregular gait. The limbs may become weak, and tasks that
require good coordination, such as writing, may become difficult.
Speech may also be impaired.
   The disease appears when both copies of the Friedreich's ataxia
gene that a person inherits from his parents are defective.
   Genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes. The
new study, based on 22 families with three or more affected
siblings, says the Friedreich's ataxia gene lies in a particular
portion of the chromosome scientists call number 9.

   Three men posing as guards of an armored car
company made off with $50,000 in cash and about $950,000 in checks
from a Pan Am airlines counter at Kennedy International Airport
Wednesday, authorities said.
   The trio, dressed in blue uniforms, entered the Pan Am building
at 1:35 p.m. and walked up to a cashier who handles ticket sales
and other transactions, said Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   He said the men presented what appeared to be legitimate
identification cards from Armored Transport in Brooklyn.
   ``They signed for a pickup and received two bags. In the bags
were $50,000 in cash and non-negotiable checks, for a total value
of just over $1 million,'' said Morrison.
   The trio then fled the terminal, and the Port Authority police
and the FBI were investigating, he said.
   Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman for the airline, declined to
comment on the incident, referring all questions to the Port
Authority.
   The full name of the armored company is Vets International
Armored Transport. A supervisor answering the telephone there
Wednesday night said its owner, Joseph Cleary, would comment on the
case Thursday.

   The Night Stalker trial has taken nearly
three years to get underway, but it may take until next spring
before a jury is selected in the case of the grisly crime rampage
that terrorized the region.
   Defense attorneys for Richard Ramirez, the 28-year-old drifter
charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies, estimate that jury
selection will last eight months.
   The entire trial is expected to take two years. The judge, who
scheduled jury selection to start late today, has said it will be
hard to find jurors able to serve in such a marathon proceeding.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan, who has presided over the
case since November of 1986, moved to get the trial under way, if
only symbolically.
   ``We are going to swear in a panel of about 70 folks and examine
them regarding hardship and any attitudes they have developed,''
said Tynan.
   ``I will ask people if they can afford to stick around for two
years for this case,'' Tynan said. ``If they say they can't survive
financially that will be good cause for them to be excused.''
   Ramirez, originally from El Paso, Tex., was captured by East Los
Angeles citizens following a siege of harrowing killings. He is
said to be eager to put his case before a jury.
   ``He's been ready to go to trial all along,'' said attorney
Daniel Hernandez who, with his co-counsel, has filed a blizzard of
pretrial motions which delayed the trial until now.
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin, has
protested delays since the case began.
   ``I am ecstatic about finally going to trial in this case,'' he
said Wednesday. ``And I hope we can move the trial along a little
more efficiently than we've attended to the pretrial affairs.''
   Ramirez' notoriety will be a key subject of inquiry.
   The pale, shaggy-haired Ramirez was the subject of a police
dragnet before citizens ran him down and captured him.
   His sometimes bizarre courtroom behavior fueled speculation that
he was a devil worshiper. At an early hearing, he shouted, ``Hail
Satan!'' and flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm. The symbol,
associated with devil worship, was found at some crime scenes and
on victims in the Night Stalker case.
   Prospective jurors who have heard of Ramirez and know of his
outbursts will be asked whether they believe he is guilty and
whether they can be unbiased.
   They will also likely be asked to remember the steamy summer of
of 1985 when residents of Southern California bolted their doors
and kept their windows closed in fear of the Night Stalker.
   The random killer typically entered homes through unlocked
doors, raped women, killed both men and women and stole jewelry and
other valuables.
   At a preliminary hearing for Ramirez in 1986, anguished
witnesses including several women who had been raped, told of
horrific confrontations with the Night Stalker who invaded their
homes, killed their husbands and demanded they ``Swear to Satan.''
   Some murders were ghoulish including one in which the victim's
eyes were gouged out.
   The Ramirez case has cost Los Angeles County $1.28 million in
court and investigatory fees. That doesn't include $15,000 a month
for the defendant's private jail cell.

   Gov. George Deukmejian proclaimed a state of
emergency for Los Angeles County on Thursday after the discovery of
two female Mediterranean fruit flies in traps.
   County agricultural officials sprayed the ground in parts of the
San Fernando Valley with a protein-based bait and set an additional
1,300 traps, said Bill Edwards, chief deputy in the county
Department of Agriculture and Weights and Measures.
   If the traps catch more flies, the state Department of Food and
Agriculture may begin aerial spraying as allowed under the
governor's proclamation, and county officials may release sterile
flies to reduce the Medfly population, said Edwards.
   The Medfly, one of the most destructive crop-destroying insects,
is considered a severe threat to California's multibillion-dollar
agricultural industry. The Medfly preys on more than 250 varieties
of produce, survives in different climates and reproduces rapidly,
officials say.
   In 1981, California spent about $100 million to eradicate a
statewide Medfly infestation that destroyed $100 million in crops.
   Last year, officials trapped 42 Medflies within a
110-square-mile part of east Los Angeles and spent $2 million to
fight the infestation, which required the importation of 700
million sterile flies and two aerial sprayings.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Geoffrey Bourne,
internationally-known nutritionist and histologist, has died at the
age of 79.
   Bourne, who was vice-chancellor of the St. George's University
School of Medicine in the Caribbean island of Grenada, died Tuesday
at the coronary care unit of New York's Bellevue Hospital, where he
was admitted two weeks ago, a spokesman for the university said.
   The Australian-born doctor was widely publishsd and wrote
several books, including ``Nutrition and the War'' (1941) and
``Starvation in Europe'' (1943), the latter of which was included
in the British Imperial War Museum as an historical document at the
request of the Duke of Floucester. He was also founder and editor
of the ``World Review of Nutrition and Dietetics'' and the
``International Review of Cystology.''
   Bourne was a demonstrator in physiology at Oxford University
from 1938 to 1947 and during World War II served as a member of the
British Special Operations Executive in charge of biomedical
research for the Special Forces in southeast Asia with the rank of
major.
   In 1945 and 1946 he was chairman of the Pan Malayan Nutrition
Council, which was in charge of assessing Malaya's food needs after
the Japanese surrender.
   Between 1948 and 1957 he was professor of histology at the
University of London and later went on to become professor and
chairman of anatomy at Emroy University Medical School in Atlanta,
Ga.
   In conjunction with these responsibilitiee, in 1962 he became
director of the Yerkes Primate Research Center at Emroy, a post he
held until he joined the St. George's University School of Medicine
in 1977 as vice-chancellor. He was also a professor of nutrition at
St. George's.
   Bourne held the degrees of bachelor of science, master of
science and doctor of science from the University of Western
Australia. He also held the degree of doctor of philosophy from
Oxford University.
   He held the honorary title of professor of health at Georgia
University, and was a fellow of the Institute of Biology in
England, of the Zoological Society of London and of the American
Society of Gerontology. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society
of Mediccne for more than half a century.
   Bourne is listed in such publications as ``Who's Who,''
``International Who's Who,'' ``Who's Who in Ameriva,''
``International Who's Who of Intellectuals,'' ``Who's Who in the
Commonwealth,'' ``Two Thousand Notable Americans,'' ``The Directory
of Distinguished Americans'' and ``Men of Achievement.''
   Funeral services for Bourne will be held in Atlanta, Ga., and a
memorial service will be held in Grenada.

   A new high-speed rail link to shuttle passengers
from central London to outlying Heathrow airport at 100 mph has
been approved by the Department of Transport.
   The $325 million Heathrow Express will whisk 10 million
passengers a year from London's Paddington station to the airport
in 17 minutes, Transport Secretary Paul Channon said Wednesday.
   A comparable trip on the London Underground _ the city's subway
_ takes about an hour. Journeys by car and bus can take even longer.
   Work on the electrically powered service could start in 1990 and
finish by 1993. The private British Airport Authority will finance
80 percent of the project, with British Rail supplying the rest.
   A slower direct rail service already links Gatwick airport,
south of London, with Victoria train station, one of the city's
major rail hubs.

   Two Moslems refused to accept a
total of $513,000 in lottery winnings, saying their religion bars
them from taking money from games of chance because that would
amount to gambling.
   Rathi Ishak, General Manager of the government-backed Social
Welfare Lottery Board, told reporters today that a man who won a
$133,000 prize in one drawing said he bought the ticket as a
donation to charity and it would be wrong for him to accept the
money.
   Earlier last year, another man refused to take his prize money
of $380,000, also because it was against his Islamic religious
principles, said Rathi, adding that that man, too, had bought the
ticket for charity.
   The lottery was started in 1950 by the British colonialists to
gather funds to run homes for orphans and old people and for other
charities, he said, and continued after independence in 1957.
   Six million tickets at about 38 cents per ticket are sold for
each drawing, which are held every three weeks. In each drawing,
$1.25 million in prizes is awarded.

   Jesse Jackson officially ended his maverick
presidential bid Wednesday, throwing his delegate support to
Michael Dukakis in a unity gesture after the Massachusetts governor
clinched the Democratic nomination.
   Jackson watched on television from his hotel suite with his
family and advisers as delegates to the Democratic National
Convention voted in the roll call of states to give Dukakis thee
prize for which the two men had so long competed.
   Jackson won 1,218.5 votes, far more than his 1984 showing, but
still well short of Dukakis' 2,876.75 nominating majority.
   Then, when the last votes had been counted, Jackson's campaign
chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, stepped forward
to move that ``in the spirit of the Jackson campaign and in the
interests of unity'' the Dukakis nomination be made unanimous.
   The motion carried overwhelmingly, with a huge chorus of
``Ayes'' and only a smattering of ``Nos'' from disappointed Jackson
supporters.
   Jackson had sent word from his hotel that he would dispatch
Brown to ``urge the convention after the official vote to make the
nomination of Governor Dukakis unanimous.''
   ``This is the appropriate time for the transition of leadership
for the fall campaign to take place,'' Jackson said.
   Feelings ran strong among many Jackson delegates, and several
from Michigan threatened to walk out when Dukakis was nominated.
The protest was averted when two Dukakis delegates agreed to switch
their votes to Jackson so the Michigan delegate count would end in
a tie, according to Mayor Walter Moore of Pontiac, Mich.
   Jackson's name was placed in nomination by William Winpisinger,
president of the International Association of Machinists, who said
the candidate had ``ignited the passionate fires of justice in our
souls,''
   ``Not since Hubert H. Humphrey has a presidential candidate
elevated the aspirations of workers and championed their quest for
worker rights to such heights in the mainstream political
dialogue,'' he said.
   Earlier, Jackson lunched with Dukakis at the nominee-to-be's
request and also met with Democratic stalwarts Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to talk, he
said, about helping the Democrats win.
   The Dukakis-Jackson meeting, the second in three days, lasted
about 30 minutes, while senior staff members talked for an
additional 45 minutes, Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said.
   ``They have been foes in the primary,'' Jackson said of the
campaign aides. ``They will be friends in the fall.''
   He said the session was ``basically a get-acquainted meeting for
staff and key policy advisers, most of whom do not know each other
but now must work together since we are in the same boat with a
common objective _ that is, to win in November.''
   Jackson, speaking before his name was placed in nomination, said
that moment would be ``a great feeling personally. But really, it's
my name put into nomination for the people who voted for me, but
also for the people who made it possible,'' he said after
addressing a brunch sponsored by the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.
   ``And so I suggest as historical dream that at one level it's
political, because it's delegates and votes. On another level, it's
sociological because it's transforming America in many ways. On
another level, it's theological _ it's fulfilling the prayers of
people who fought hard.''
   ``It's a steppingstone for progress for the future.''
   Jackson began the day by finally taking the step that Dukakis
had wanted since early June _ answering without evasion the
question of whether he would endorse the Massachusetts governor and
would campaign enthusiastically for the national ticket in the fall.
   ``Oh yes, I am,'' Jackson said on ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' ``But in some sense,the relationship I will have with
the campaign must be defined by Gov. Dukakis. This is true for
Mario Cuomo. This is true for Ted Kennedy. This is true for Lane
Kirkland.''
   Jackson was both joking and slightly bitter in his speech to the
SCLC as his second try for the White House wound down to an
unsuccessful conclusion.
   ``And now I'm running for vice president,'' Jackson said,
invoking fears of a challenge to Dukakis choice _ Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen _ ``of the SCLC.''
   He suggested that his race prevented him from being on the
national ticket and belittled suggestions he lacked the experience
for the presidency.
   ``The fact is we are fighting a cultural crisis. The fact is if
any other candidate had campaigned as hard as I did, campaigned
against those odds and achieved as much, that person no doubt would
probably be the nominee or certainly on the ticket,'' Jackson said
on NBC News' Today Show.
   He promised to fight on to another campaign, as yet undefined.
   ``Our charge today is to learn well the lessons from this
campaign and build upon it the vision for the next campaign _ learn
what is possible,'' he told the SCLC.
   ``And so it becomes my challenge, just as Fannie Lou Hamer had
to keep knocking and pushing down doors, through barriers, and just
as Dr. King had to do it, I'm still doing it and I'm determined to
push those doors down,'' he said. ``I may not get through those
doors, but my children and your children will get through those
doors and the White House is within reach. ... I am pushing back
barriers and removing ceilings off of dreams every day. I see it as
my obligation, in a real sense now my mission.''

<HEAD>Four Workers Disciplined At TMI After Sleeping Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five more management-level employees at
the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear plant have been disciplined as
the result of an inquiry into frequent sleeping by a control room
supervisor, company officials said Wednesday.
   The actions by GPU Nuclear Corp., including dismissal of one
employee, stem from conclusions in an independent report issued to
the company on June 30, the officials said. The report said
managers at the plant did not aggressively investigate allegations
that a control room shift supervisor was sleeping on duty, thus
indirectly allowing the situation to continue.
   The report said management's failure to fully look into the
allegations, as well as accepting denials by the supervisor and
discounting statements by others, led to ``inaccurate and distorted
information'' being passed through TMI management and to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   ``They (managers) didn't get a full picture of what occurred.
The situation festered,'' said GPU spokesman Doug Bedell.
   An earlier report found the sleeping had occurred as early as
1983 and continued through June 1987. The shift supervisor was
fired Nov. 27, after the release of the first report.
   The Unit 2 reactor, site of the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident, has been shut down since 1979. The shift
supervisor, however, is responsible for overseeing staff,
fire-protection systems and radiation monitors at the plant.
   Of the four management-level workers disciplined but retained,
Bedell said two were reassigned to lower-level positions that did
not involve supervision of licensed reactor operators at TMI-2 and
that formal reprimands were filed against two others.
   Bedell said, ``We have lessons to learn as far as supervisory
techniques. This was not handled well.''
   He said managers had perceived the problem as stemming from
``friction'' between the crew and the shift supervisor.
   ``They accepted the view of the shift supervisor instead of what
they were hearing from the crews,'' he said.

   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton saluted Michael
Dukakis as a man of vision and character Wednesday night in a
presidential nominating speech that Democratic delegates cheered
loudest when it finally drew to an end.
   Clinton ignored a flashing red light on the podium signalling
that he had exceeded his allotted 15 minutes, and at one point
House Speaker Jim Wright, the convention chairman, edged close to
remind him to finish up.
   Clinton was no match for the oratory of Jesse Jackson's
nominators, and the Dukakis delegates were eager to get on with the
roll call of the states that finally delivered the nomination to
the Massachusetts governor.
   Clinton said Dukakis ``has the character, the record and the
vision America needs at this moment in our journey. ... He'll help
us seize the future and make it ours.''
   Clinton got his loudest cheer when he said, ``In closing ... ''
One network, NBC, cut away from the speech.
   Leaving the podium, he told reporters that he had practiced the
talk repeatedly and it had never lasted more than 15 minutes. It
ran twice as long because of the cheers and chants of the enthused
Dukakis delegates, he said.
   ``They just desperately wanted to cheer for Dukakis,'' he said.
``They wanted to make noise.''
   In the speech, Clinton said Dukakis' ``character is steadfast
and consistent. He wakes up in the same world every day, a trait of
no small importance in a president.''
   ``He hasn't just played with issues, he's wrestled them to the
ground. He has made the hard decisions: to balance budgets, create
jobs, fight crime and drug abuse, move people from welfare to work,
expand day care and health care, increase housing and improve
education,'' said Clinton, who shared Dukakis' experience of being
voted out of the governor's office only to stage a comeback.
   ``When he needs to be, Michael Dukakis is tough as nails,'' he
said.
   At a time when America is facing new economic challenges abroad
and ``an epidemic of social problems'' at home, Clinton said,
Dukakis ``believes America's best days lie ahead. He reminds us
that we've faced even greater challenges in the past. He is an
apostle of hope.''
   Decrying homelessness, illiteracy and infant morality, Clinton
said, ``I want Michael Dukakis to be president because he knows we
don't have a single person to waste.''
   ``His whole life is a tribute to the enduring strength of the
American dream. He knows that unless that dream is real for all our
children, it is not secure for any of them. And he'll help us seize
the future and make it ours,'' said Clinton.
   ``He's old-fashioned all right: he's the kind of man who plays
it straight, keeps his word and pays his bills.''
   Clinton, 41, met Dukakis in 1981, when ``he was teaching at the
Kennedy School and I was the youngest ex-governor in American
history.''
   ``Both of us were ... given a rare second chance by our people.
That does wonders for your sensitivity to others,'' he said.
   ``He has also been a soldier, a lawyer, a teacher, a legislator.
He has excelled in all these roles because of his fine mind and his
keen interest in other people,'' said Clinton.
   ``Michael Dukakis is a man with a vision, a shining vision for
America _ a country with good jobs at good wages; a country where
all Americans can send their children to good public schools and
... college; a country where working parents have access to good
child care and health care for their kids; one where people can get
decent long-term care without going to the poorhouse; a country
with a clean environment and, yes, a clean government devoted once
again to the rule of law,'' said Clinton.
   Clinton said that after Jesse Jackson spoke Tuesday night,
``many of you waved signs with his slogan: `Keep Hope Alive.' In
his own way, Mike Dukakis will never let us forget that
admonition.''

<HEAD>Nation Gets The Wrong Vote From Iowa At First</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   The nation initially got the wrong vote from the
Iowa delegation Wednesday night as Democrats nominated Michael
Dukakis as their 1988 presidential candidate.
   Jerry Crawford stepped to the microphone to announce that, in a
show of unity, he and state Sen. Thomas Mann of Des Moines would
jointly announce the Hawkeye State's vote total.
   When Crawford said the word ``unity'' after announcing 49 votes
for Dukakis, convention secretary Dorothy Bush and her assistant
promptly announced that Iowa had cast all 61 of its votes for
Dukakis.
   Reached by telephone on the convention floor, Crawford said his
intention was to have Mann announce that Jesse Jackson had received
12 votes.
   Throughout the convention, leaders of the Iowa delegation have
credited Mann with stressing party unity above loyalty to a single
candidate.
   The Iowa delegates phoned the podium immediately after the error
was made, and the delegation was asked to announce its vote a
second time.
   This time, the Crawford-Mann unity announcement was made without
a hitch.

   California's 235 votes gave Michael Dukakis the

Wednesday.
   A dozen states, including Dukakis' home state of Massachusetts,
passed during the roll call in a prearranged plan to have
California put Dukakis over the 2,082 votes needed to secure the
nomination.
   In 1984, New Jersey provided Walter Mondale with the margin
needed to win the nomination.
   In all, Dukakis received 2,876.25 votes, while Jesse Jackson
received 1,218.5. Nine votes were cast for other candidates.

<HEAD>EPA Not Protecting Public Against Hazardous Wastes, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's
12-year-old campaign against hazardous waste is not protecting
public health and the environment, a congressional report says.
   The broad-ranging critique by the General Accounting Office says
EPA has made only limited progress in administering and enforcing
the 1976 law covering the handling, storage and disposal of
health-threatening wastes.
   The report by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, cites
a variety of problems, including failure to meet congressionally
set deadlines, inadequate resources, shifting enforcement
approaches and lack of information.
   ``EPA's progress in regulating hazardous wastes that it has
identified has been limited and not sufficiently comprehensive to
protect the public and the environment,'' GAO concluded.
   The report said EPA is regulating about 450 materials known to
be hazardous, with only five having been added to the list since
1980.
   Still to be controlled are ``potentially large volumes of
hazardous wastes,'' but EPA has not determined what industries need
to be reviewed or how long it will take to assess the suspect
materials, according to GAO.
   ``We believe EPA's limited progress has resulted from the
absence of an overall waste identification goal and a related
implementation approach that together would focus and assign
priorities in the program,'' the study said.
   The 1976 law, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
was enacted in response to unregulated toxic dumps such as Love
Canal near Niagara Falls, N.Y., but GAO said the law is not
preventing new Love Canals.
   The study quotes EPA as saying that as many as half the 5,000
storage and disposal sites regulated under RCRA may be leaking
hazardous materials and could require expensive cleanups.
   ``EPA has made very little progress in achieving actual cleanups
or in setting goals for actual cleanups because of other RCRA
program priorities and the complexity involved in identifying the
extent of contamination and the level of cleanup required,'' GAO
said.
   The study said it could take until the year 2025 to clean up the
regulated RCRA sites through an effort rivaling ``Superfund,'' the
cleanup program that the EPA says could spend $22.7 billion at some
2,500 abandoned dump sites.
   ``The longer EPA waits to actually implement corrective action
at RCRA facilities, the greater the risk will become that the
contamination at the leaking facilities will worsen and that a
number of these facilities will have to be cleaned up under
Superfund,'' GAO said.
   The report said there has been ``widespread and persistent''
non-compliance with RCRA regulations by both private sector and
federal facilities, with only about half the regulated
land-disposal sites meeting standards over the past three years.
   GAO said that while the principal reasons for non-compliance are
the technical complexity of the regulations and the costs of
following them, ``ineffective enforcement on the part of EPA and
states'' has been part of the problem.
   Compliance inspections have been increasing, the report said,
but when GAO investigators went out on 26 of them, they observed
inspectors missing almost as many violations as they cited.
   In its 1984 reworking of RCRA, EPA was given 76 specific
deadlines for taking RCRA actions by a Congress that was unhappy
with the agency's progress in controlling hazardous wastes.
   As of last April, 66 of the deadlines had come due, with EPA
missing 38 of them, said GAO.
   GAO quoted EPA as saying the report ``adequately describes'' the
situation and that officials are working to improve the
administration of the hazardous waste law on a variety of fronts.

   With six months left for President
Reagan to get conservative nominees confirmed to federal
judgeships, administration officials are mapping strategy to
overcome what they say is foot-dragging by the
Democratic-controlled Senate.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the matter of
judicial nominations was high on the list of topics to be discussed
today by White House aides at a planning session called by the
president's chief of staff, Kenneth Duberstein.
   ``We're talking about judgeships and getting our nominees
confirmed,'' Fitzwater told reporters Wednesday.
   The president's term will end next Jan. 20. Already, according
to many legal scholars, he has named enough judges to life terms on
federal district and circuit courts to put his conservative stamp
on the judiciary for many years.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten, however, said the
administration is concerned about inaction in the Senate on pending
nominations. Korten said there are 26 judicial nominations awaiting
Senate action _ 20 of them for district judgeships and six for
positions on the circuit courts of appeal.
   ``The absence of even one circuit judge on a circuit that only
has 12 can put a crimp in their ability to handle the workload,''
Korten said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``There hasn't been any action on (Capitol) Hill for many
months,'' Korten said. ``They have been dragging their feet.''
   By delaying action on nominations in the closing months of the
administration, the Democrats who control the Senate could give
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis a chance to make
the appointments in the event of his election.
   Jane Verman Bourgeois, spokeswoman for the Judiciary Committee,
failed to respond to repeated telephone calls seeking comment on
the meeting and Korten's statements.
   All federal judicial nominations are subject to confirmation by
the Senate after first being screened by the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary B.J. Cooper said he did not
know what strategy Duberstein and the White House aides would be
discussing to push for action on the backlog of nominations.
   Fitzwater said the judicial nominee situation was one of several
items to be discussed at today's meeting.
   ``It's to go over themes, agenda, schedule, budget _ those kinds
of internal matters,'' he said. ``We'll have a review of all the
legislation that's now on the hill and what the administration's
position is.''
   ``We'll talk about any speeches or trips by the president and
what kind of themes we want, or we recommend that be discussed in
those appearances,'' the spokesman said.
   He said Duberstein had talked extensively with the president
about his plans for the election campaign and the final months of
his administration before Reagan came west to vacation at his
mountaintop ranch north of Santa Barbara.
   Fitzwater said the president has talked about a schedule of two
campaign appearances a week after September. He also said two
political fund-raising appearances are planned in Los Angeles
during another California vacation that the president plans for
next month.
   When asked whether the president had watched any of the
Democratic National Convention on television at the ranch,
Fitzwater said, ``I know he was going to watch parts of it. My
guess is he did, but I don't really know.''
   On Wednesday, Reagan signed an $18 billion energy and water
development appropriations bill that he said reached his desk
earlier than any other appropriations bill since he became
president. He urged Congres to swiftly complete work on the
remaining 12 appropriations bills for fiscal 1989.

<HEAD>Group Questions Tax-Exempt Status of Underwriters Laboratories</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Underwriters Laboratories Inc. enjoys a
tax-exempt status that is unfair to its competitors and Congress
should take away this special benefit, the director of the American
Council of Independent Laboratories says.
   Joseph O'Neil, executive director of the council, said Wednesday
a 1954 law gave Underwriters Laboratories the status of a
non-profit organization even though the famed research institute
competes with hundreds of independent testing laboratories that
must pay taxes.
   ``This is an egregious example of abuse of the non-profit tax
status,'' O'Neil said. He said UL is making millions of dollars in
profits while ``enjoying an unfair competitive advantage over other
testing laboratories.''
   Underwriter Laboratories spokeswoman Sharon Dalton said the
Illinois company last year had revenues of $159 million, but that
it does not regard any of this as profit.
   She said UL spent about $10 million on non-revenue-producing
activities that are for ``public safety.''
   UL, said Ms. Dalton, has developed 541 safety standards,
provides expertise to 620 committees developing safety standards
and assists several government agencies in developing safety
standards and documents. All of this work, she said, is done free
of charge.
   ``It would be difficult to perform these things at the level
that we do now'' without the tax-exempt status, she said. Money
earned by UL in testing commercial products, said Ms. Dalton, is
plowed back into ``public interest testing dollar for dollar.''
   Testing laboratories are used by manufacturers to determine if
their products are safe. The products tested by such laboratories
range from electrical appliances to cosmetics. UL is most famous
for developing testing standards for electrical appliances and
installations that are used throughout the industry.
   O'Neil said UL, organized in 1894 and headquartered in
Northbrook, Ill., originally operated as a non-profit organization.
He said that in 1935, however, the Internal Revenue Service revoked
the tax-exempt status for UL when it was shown that the laboratory
was conducting commercial testing.
   UL appealed the ruling, but a federal court's decision supported
the IRS and the laboratory lost its tax-favored status. The
Illinois firm's tax exempt status was restored, O'Neil said, when
``Congress abruptly changed the rules'' in 1954 by adopting a bill
that granted tax-exempt status to laboratories that are ``testing
for the public safety.''
   Since then, O'Neil said, UL has enjoyed a ``significant
advantage'' and now is moving into a number of testing fields that
threaten the continuing existence of many independent testing
laboratories.
   ``All we're asking for is a level playing field,'' O'Neil said.
   The American Council of Independent Laboratories is the trade
association of independent, for-profit, testing labs. O'Neil said
it has 370 member firms that operate about 1,000 laboratories.

   Farmers collectively may wind up with about as
much cash income in 1988 as last year's record level, according to
Agriculture Department economists.
   Some farmers have been hit hard by drought while others were
only nudged or escaped altogether. Those are the farmers who were
able to take advantage of higher commodity prices.
   The result is a greater income disparity than usual among
farmers and from one production region to another, depending on
where the rain fell and when.
   ``Although little overall change is expected in income, regional
disruptions are arising because income differs sharply among
individual farmers from what it would have been with normal
weather,'' the department's Economic Research Service said
Wednesday.
   Smaller, drought-withered crops and a sharp drawdown of grain
held in storage have boosted commodity prices ``usually by more
than enough to offset reduced yields,'' the report said.
   ``This year's cash receipts (from sales) are up because of
higher crop values and sales from past years' crops in storage at
drought-increased prices,'' the report said. ``However, farmers hit
hardest by the weather are expected to have much lower receipts.''
   Officials said the rise in commodity prices may boost farmers'
gross cash income nationally to a range of $162 billion to $167
billion in 1988, about $4 billion higher than projected last month.
Nationally, the gross was about $159 billion in 1987.
   Gross cash income includes proceeds from marketings and direct
government payments. When cash expenses are deducted, what is left
is called net cash income, which was projected at $53 billion to
$59 billion for 1988, compared with the record of $56 billion in
1987.
   The agency also computes ``net farm income'' to include
allowances for the value of goods consumed at home, dwellings and
changes in the value of inventories held by farmers.
   On that basis, this year's net farm income could be in the range
of $40 billion to $45 billion, down from $42 billion to $48 billion
forecast in June. Net farm income in 1987 was $46 billion.
   Officials said the decline _ $1 billion to $6 billion from last
year _ reflects the drop in 1988 production.
   Direct government payments to farmers, including ``deficiency''
payments to crop producers, are expected to decline this year to a
range of $11 billion to $13 billion, from a record of $17 billion
in 1987, said economist Richard Kodl. The higher market prices are
trimming the subsidies.
   But the biggest reduction will come in calendar 1989, Kodl said.
That is because most of the payments for 1988 crops will go to
farmers next year, after USDA does the bookkeeping on how much will
be due.
   The report also said:
   _Drought has hurt non-irrigated fruits and vegetables,
especially dry edible beans, tart cherries, green peas, sweet corn
and snap beans for canning. Fresh vegetable production tends to be
irrigated and has survived relatively well.
   _Pasture and range conditions as of July 1 were the worst since
records began in 1921. Farmers have had to sell some breeding stock
from pastures, and the increased need to supplemental feeding has
driven up the price of hay.
   _As a result of herd culling, meat supplies are increasing, and
prices received for livestock are dropping. But increased sales and
higher prices for poultry and eggs are maintaining livestock cash
receipts. Higher feed costs, however, may push livestock operations
from profit to loss in the second half of the year.

   Farmers in designated drought counties can cut
hay from Conservation Reserve Program land through Aug. 31 to
provide emergency feed for livestock, the Agriculture Department
says.
   Ralph D. Klopfenstein of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service said Wednesday the action
means that individual counties won't have to apply for extensions
of the haying privilege, which had been limited to 30 days from the
date a county was designated.
   Further details can be obtained at local ASCS offices, he said.
More than 2,000 counties in about 40 states have been designated
for emergency haying on CRP land.

   Production of farm-grown catfish in June
jumped 17 percent from a year earlier to 22.8 million pounds, the
Agriculture Department reports.
   Production this year through June was about 146 million pounds,
up from 138.7 million pounds in the first six months of last year.
   The average price paid to growers last month was 78 cents per
pound, liveweight, up 14 cents from June 1987, the department's
National Agricultural Statistics Service said Wednesday.
   Prices received by processors averaged $1.68 per pound for
ice-packed whole fish and $1.80 for frozen. Sales of whole fish
represented 35 percent of the total, and fillets accounted for 46
percent. The remainder included steaks, nuggets and other items.
   Imports of freshwater catfish in May were reported at 1.02
million pounds, nearly all from Brazil.

<HEAD>Novelist's Wife Says Someone `Playing Game' on Them</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The wife of exiled Russian novelist Alexander
I. Solzhenitsyn is emphatically denying reports that Kremlin
officials have invited her husband to return to his homeland,
saying ``someone is playing a game on us.''
   Natalya Solzhenitsyn, in a rare interview Wednesday, told The
Associated Press it is too early to speculate on whether Soviet
authorities will invite him back after 14 years in exile or publish
his books, as was reported.
   ``Someone is playing a game on us,'' she said by telephone from
their home in rural Vermont. ``We never received any telephone call
or letter from Soviet officials about publishing his books there or
about us returning to the Soviet Union.''
   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn also said her husband was making no public
comment on the reforms of Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Solzhenitsyn, who will turn 70 on Dec. 11, has maintained a
public silence since 1983, two years before Gorbachev rose to power.
   ``He stopped speaking publicly five years ago because of his
literary work,'' Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said. ``He made a decision to
devote full efforts to literary tasks. It is hard to be both a
public and a literary figure.''
   Asked whether they hoped that Soviet authorities would publish
his books or invite the family to return home, Mrs. Solzhenitsyn
said: ``In my opinion, it is not proper to answer a question that
has not been asked. It is not time to speculate.''
   In 1962, under the reforms of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev,
the literary magazine ``Novy Mir'' published one of Solzhenitsyn's
novels, ``A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,'' a grim chronicle
of life in a Soviet prison camp. The book was based on
Solzhenitsyn's own camp term, the theme that has dominated his work.
   Khrushchev was ousted in 1964, the thaw ended, and
Solzhenitsyn's works were banned in the Soviet Union.
   They were smuggled to the West and published, however, winning
Solzhenitsyn the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970. He did not
leave the Soviet Union to collect the award, for fear his return
would be blocked.
   Solzhenitsyn was exiled in 1974 following publication in the
West of ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' a multivolume chronicle of the
prison camps, or ``gulags,'' which he said stretched like a hidden
chain of islands across the Soviet Union.
   Although Soviet authorities are now rewriting official histories
to mention, for the first time, the millions of people who suffered
and died under Kremlin dictator Josef Stalin, Solzhenitsyn's works
still are banned, in part because he was harshly critical of
Vladimir Lenin, revered as the founder of the Soviet state.
   The appearance of many Soviet works critical of Stalin has
prompted wide speculation, and persistent news reports, that
Kremlin officials would allow publication of Solzhenitsyn's works.
   Last month, Sergei P. Zalygin, the current editor of ``Novy
Mir,'' told reporters he was negotiating with Solzhenitsyn to
publish his novel, ``Cancer Ward,'' in the Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn denied the report. ``Up to now, we never
received any communication from Soviet authorities on the
publication of any of his books.''
   ``The only letter we ever received from Soviet officials was in
1976, a letter from the Soviet Embassy in Washington informing me
that I was being deprived of my Soviet citzenship because of my
activities,'' she said. ``My husband has received nothing.''
   She also denied a report by a Bavarian radio station quoting her
husband as saying he had received two letters from Gorbachev.
   The station, Bayerischer Rundfunk, based in Munich, reported
last Friday that Solzhenitsyn had accepted an invitation from
Gorbachev and that his books would be published there. At the time,
Solzhenitsyn issued a statement denying the report.
   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn became a U.S. citizen in 1985. Soviet
authorities also revoked her husband's citizenship, and he has not
become the citizen of any other country.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mario Biaggi's re-election campaign has
gone into debt as the New York Democrat, convicted of taking an
illegal gratuity and under indictment on additional charges,
continues to use campaign dollars to pay his legal fees.
   According to Biaggi's latest report to the Federal Election
Commission, the 10-term congressman paid his lawyers $130,000 from
the campaign treasury between April 1 and June 30, 1988. In all,
Biaggi has spent about $496,000 from his campaign coffers on
lawyers since 1986, when his legal troubles began.
   The campaign began the quarter with $37,160 on hand and
collected $16,500 in donations from four political action
committees representing labor unions. But because of expenditures,
including the legal fees, the campaign wound up the quarter with a
$17,872 cash deficit and a $70,000 debt, representing personal
loans Biaggi made to his campaign during the quarter.
   Biaggi also has a separate defense fund, but his spokesman, Bob
Blancato, has declined to make public its cash flow. Blancato has
estimated that Biaggi's defense ultimately could cost about $1
million.
   The congressman has been on trial for the last four months in
the Wedtech scandal, in which he and six others are accused of
turning the Bronx, N.Y., military contractor into a racketeering
enterprise. The jury heard closing arguments in the trial Wednesday.
   In another federal trial, Biaggi was convicted last year of
accepting an illegal gratuity in the form of a paid Florida
vacation. He was sentenced to 2{ years in prison and a $500,000
fine but is free pending appeal.
   Biaggi's two Democratic opponents _ Bronx Assemblyman Eliot
Engel and Vincent Marchiselli _ have filed challenges to his
nominating petitions and Biaggi in return has challenged their
petitions to gain access to the September primary ballot.
   The grounds ``are just general right now,'' but each man has six
days from the challenge date to specify what he believes is wrong
with the others' petitions, state Board of Elections spokesman
Steven LaFever said.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union are
expected to sign an agreement this year to cooperate in the war
against drugs, a senior administration official says.
   ``The Soviets have started to recognize the problem, and the war
in Afghanistan has something to do with it,'' said David L.
Westrate, head of operations for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, the lead U.S. organization in combating drugs.
   John C. Lawn, administrator of the DEA, and Ann B. Wrobleski, an
assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters,
discussed possible areas of cooperation with Soviet officials
during an April 27-30 trip to Moscow, Westrate said in an interview
Wednesday.
   Discussions are continuing, and the two sides are expected to
sign a formal agreement in several months, although the exact date
and place have not been decided, he said.
   The development is significant because for years the Soviets
denied they had a drug problem. The greater openness under Kremlin
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the exposure of Red Army troops to
hashish and opium in Afghanistan have changed that.
   The benefits of the agreement to the United States are not
clear, said Westrate, but ``the fact that they want to be in the
international community in this field is important.''
   ``You have to be able to pursue these cases beyond your own
borders,'' he said. ``There is also symbolic value for other
countries, that they should be assisting as well.''
   Lawn and Wrobleski met in Moscow with officials from the
Interior Ministry, which supervises national law enforcement; the
Foreign Ministry; the customs service; and the procurator's office,
which prosecutes cases.
   Westrate said the proposed agreement will cover at least four
points:
   _Exchanging information on drug trafficking and drug routes.
   _Exchanging drug samples: Analysts can determine the region or
nation in which a drug originated using a chemical signature unique
to the substance.
   _Training: Soviet officials expressed interest in learning some
of the techniques DEA agents use in fighting the drug trade.
   _Exchanging data on ``precursor chemicals,'' such as ether, used
to process cocaine, and acetic anhydride, used to process heroin.
   The Soviets told U.S. officials that their main drug problems
were hashish and opiates, apparently smuggled in from Afghanistan,
along with diverted pharmaceuticals and substances made in
clandestine laboratories, said Westrate.
   Drug dependence has grown at a rate of 50 percent a year in the
Soviet Union, the officials told Lawn and Wrobleski, with an
estimated 150,000 to 200,000 heavy users. Of those, 60 percent were
estimated to be under 30 years old.
   Of those whose who were dependent on drugs, 45 percent used
cannabis, mostly hashish, 35 percent used opiates such as heroin,
and 20 percent used pharmaceuticals, DEA officials said.
   The Soviet drug problem is not rated as serious as that in the
United States, where the DEA estimates there are 18 million
marijuana smokers, 11 million cocaine users and 500,000 heroin
addicts.
   U.S. officials also have worked out a cooperative arrangement
with the Peoples' Republic of China. Earlier this year, Chinese
help led to major arrests and the disruption of a heroin smuggling
ring linking Hong Kong, San Francisco and the Chinese port of
Shanghai.

<HEAD>North Wants Trial Delayed Until After Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North is asking
that his Iran-Contra conspiracy trial be delayed six months until
March because of this year's presidential election.
   North, a former White House aide, is scheduled to go on trial
Sept. 20 as the first of four defendants charged by the government
with various offenses, including conspiracy to illegally divert
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``No fair-minded person could argue that this trial should be
started seven weeks prior to the presidential election,'' North's
attorney, Barry S. Simon, said in a brief filed in federal court
Wednesday. ``The intense publicity generated during the final seven
weeks of a presidential campaign would deny (North) a fair trial.''
   Simon said the impact of the publicity on the jury would be
particularly crucial because U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,
the presiding judge, has refused to sequester the jury.
   ``Because the conduct at issue in this case is also a key issue
in the campaign, the testimony of key administration officials _
and the impact of that testimony on the election _ is certain to
generate intense media scrutiny and commentary beyond anything seen
before,'' the motion said.
   Earlier Wednesday, North, two other Iran-Contra defendants and
the American Civil Liberties Union asked the U.S. Court of Appeals
to order the dismissal of charges against the three men because
their immunized testimony before Congress will be used against them
at trial.
   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and
businessman Albert Hakim, along with the ACLU, filed briefs in
which they said the use of the compelled testimony would violate
the Fifth Amendment prohibition against being a witness against
oneself.
   At the minimum, they said, the appellate court should order
Gesell to hold a pretrial hearing to give them an opportunity to
show that the evidence to be used against them is tainted. Gesell
rejected the defendants' complaints on the matter last month.
   The fourth defendant in the Iran-Contra case, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, also testified before Congress but had
not been granted limited immunity for his testimony.

<HEAD>EPA Seeks Comment On What Is `Acceptable' Environmental Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is asking
the public to help decide what are acceptable environmental risks
and how far such risks should be reduced if many jobs could be lost.
   A related question is: How much should the risks people face
depend on where they live?
   The agency is asking the questions for benzene, one of the
nation's most important chemicals, with nearly 12 billion pounds
sold annually for making gasoline, rubber, plastics, fibers and
many other chemicals.
   Benzene causes slightly more than an estimated three cases of
leukemia a year among people living near chemical plants.
Regulatory strategies being subjected to public comment would
reduce that to one case every other year, one case every 550 years
or something in between.
   Far more than three leukemias, a form of blood cancer, are at
issue. The answers will be used to regulate dozens of other
hazardous air pollutants EPA estimates could cause 2,000 cancers a
year.
   Roughly half the population breathes industrial-source benzene,
almost all in tiny amounts. Those actually at risk are the very
small numbers of people living close to sources such as coke ovens,
refineries and other plants.
   Some 240,000 workers are covered by the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, which permits much higher risks.
   EPA is under court order to revise its benzene regulations by
December. The order requires an initial determination of what is an
``acceptable'' risk, ignoring cost and feasibility, then a
determination of what the statutorily required ``adequate margin of
safety'' should be, taking into account cost and feasibility.
   The strictest of the agency's four possible approaches could
mean 131 plants could close, throwing 30,000 to 40,000 people out
of work. Similarly, 44 coke byproduct plants might close, with the
loss of 7,000 jobs.
   Meeting with reporters Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee M.
Thomas said: ``When you make that first decision _ acceptable risk
_ depending on how you make it, you may have dramatic consequences
in plant closings and job loss. ... It's very difficult not to take
them into account.''
   ``I don't accept'' the inevitability of plant closings, Thomas
said, because the agency has not considered _ and wants comment on
_ the extent to which it can get companies to develop new
technologies in response to tougher new standards.
   Existing or planned regulations would control 90 percent to 95
percent of emissions in question, and ``It's that (remaining) 5
percent that is really where the debate is,'' he said.
   Thomas said he decided that before deciding on a risk-reducing
approach, ``the issues should be laid out much more thoroughly, and
we needed a public process,'' including a Washington public hearing
Sept. 1.
   Risks permitted by government vary widely. EPA generally has
tried to reduce lifetime risks of cancer when they are one in
10,000 or larger, and has tended to ignore risks of one in a
million or less.
   Maximum permitted workplace exposure to benzene means a one in
100 chance of leukemia, according to OSHA.
   The average risk of dying in an auto accident is about one in
100. The risk of cancer at sea level from natural background
radiation is about one in 1,000. A woman's risk of breast cancer is
about one in 10.

<HEAD>Health Group Criticizes FDA On Sulfite Inaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer health group is criticizing the
Food and Drug Administration for proposing to allow continued use
of sulfites, which the group says can make food deadly to more than
a million Americans.
   An unpublished memo from FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young rejects
proposals to outlaw the preservative chemicals in foods not now
covered by a limited ban and to require labeling of
sulfite-containing foods served in restaurants.
   The memo to Health and Human Services Director Otis Bowen,
obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, proposes to keep
sulfites in the category ``GRAS,'' or ``generally recognized as
safe.'' A ban on their use on fresh fruits and vegetables would
remain in effect and a further ban applying to previously exempted
fresh potatoes is expected by the end of the year.
   The partial ban went into effect in 1986 primarily to prevent
the use of sulfites in salad bars, where it was used to keep
lettuce crisp and to make other vegetables and fruit look fresher.
   Young's memo said that a 1987 sulfite labeling requirement for
some packaged foods would be extended to additional items, but they
would not include dehydrated or frozen potatoes, which would remain
exempt.
   The chemicals, which have been used in foods for decades and
more recently in some drugs to protect their potency, are
considered harmless to most people.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, or CSPI, said
Wednesday that the FDA's position endangers up to a million
asthmatics and others who have severe reactions to sulfites,
including the possibility of death within hours after ingesting
food containing the chemicals.
   The center, a privately funded consumer health group, says
sulfites have caused comas, brain damage and at least five deaths.
   Mitch Zeller, staff attorney for the consumer group, predicted
that the FDA's position would be approved by the Department of
Health and Human Services, saying it ``does so little and bends
over backwards to placate the food industry.''
   The memo asks for action on the proposed regulations by July 30.
   Young's memo, which FDA spokesman Chris Lecos said was not meant
to be made public until the proposed regulations are approved,
acknowledges that many new uses have been found for sulfites and
that ``a significant number of individuals'' have experienced
``severe allergic-type responses.''
   Other FDA officials have estimated that sulfites are dangerous
to about 10 percent of the 10 million people in the United States
with asthma and to a small number of non-asthmatics, according to
Lecos.
   But the FDA maintains the reaction is essentially allergic and
does not justify an all-out ban of the chemicals in food or drugs.
   The memo says ``the available safety data'' does not support a
complete ban or an extension to foods other than those already
covered, except for fresh potatoes.
   Restaurant labeling would be ``labor intensive and difficult to
enforce,'' the memo says, adding that it would require regular
inspection of over 500,000 eating establishments.
   Lecos said the FDA had no comment on the memo. Other officials
acknowledged the existence of the memo and proposed regulations but
said it was not for public release. The AP obtained a copy from a
source outside the agency.

<HEAD>Bush Still Leading Dukakis In Campaign Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush continues to lead
Democrat Michael Dukakis in spending on the presidential campaign
trail, but Dukakis outspent his GOP rival during June, financial
reports show.
   Dukakis reported to the Federal Election Commission that his
campaign spent $1,939,385 last month, compared to $1,197,784 spent
by Bush.
   Overall, the Republican vice president has spent $22,107,183 to
Dukakis' $20,714,342. Each candidate is allowed to spend
$23,050,000 during the primary campaign, which ends with the
nomination.
   That meant Dukakis had another $2,285,658 to spend between July
1 and his nomination last night. Bush, pushing far closer to the
spending cap, had $942,817 to spend between July 1 and his
scheduled nomination in mid-August.
   Edie Holiday, chief counsel and financial director for the Bush
campaign, said the campaign will not hit the ceiling before Bush is
nominated.
   ``We're very comfortable with where we are right now,'' she said.
   Each candidate will get $46.1 million from the Treasury for the
general election, with Dukakis, because of the earlier nomination,
having to make his money go a longer distance.
   In reports covering advanced spending for the general election,
Dukakis was leading Bush in outlays, $309,604 to $269,050.
   The FEC said it had not received a June spending report from
Democrat Jesse Jackson on Wednesday, when the reports were required
to be mailed or delivered to the agency.

   With Jesse Jackson still in his hotel suite,
California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown took on the ritual role of
asking the Democratic Party to unify behind its presidential
nominee Wednesday night.
   Brown, the national chairman of Jesse Jackson's presidential
campaign, told the cheering crowd that he had just talked to
Jackson and that Jackson had asked him to make the nomination of
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis unanimous.
   Brown did not miss a chance, however, to point out that Jackson
``won more votes than any other runner-up in history.''
   Brown said he had received a telephone call from Jackson asking
him to move acclamation just five minutes before he took the
action, and that Jackson was laughing and joking in the phone call.
   ``He simply said please make it by acclamation, at my request,
and do it with the same appropriate sensitivity as we've attempted
to conduct ourselves with during the campaign,'' Brown said.
   The convention agreed to the motion with only barely heard
dissenting votes.

   Union leader William Winpisinger praised Jesse
Jackson as one ``who has ignited the passionate fires of justice in
our souls,'' as he placed the civil rights leader's name in
nomination Wednesday for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``Not since Hubert H. Humphrey has a presidential candidate
elevated the aspirations of workers and championed their quest for
worker rights to such heights in the mainstream political
dialogue,'' said the head of the International Association of
Machinists.
   Even as Jackson's name went into nomination, it was clear that
his cause was lost, that Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was the
party's choice for the presidential nomination.
   Jackson won 1,218.5 votes, far more than his 1984 showing, but
still well short of Dukakis' 2,876.25 nominating majority.
   After the last state had responded to the roll call, Jackson's
campaign chairman, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown,
stepped forward to move that the Dukakis nomination be made
unanimous. The motion carried, with only a few objections.
   In her seconding speech for Jackson, California Assemblywoman
Maxine Waters said ``This one man will one day, one way, this one
man will be the president of the United States of America. As his
name goes in nomination, so does yours. We will all never be the
same.''
   Jackson's nomination was also seconded by New York State Senator
Olga Mendez.
   ``He has a vision of America ... his vision emcompasses all of
us,'' said the Hispanic politician. ``Jackson understands our
reality. He includes us in the common effort to eliminate poverty.''
   Bright red ``Jesse Jesse'' signs were hoisted in the air for a
five-minute demonstration when Winpisinger proclaimed, ``I am
inordinately proud and uniquely privileged to offer in nomination
for president of the United States, the name of Jesse Louis
Jackson. ''
   ``Jesse, Jesse, Jesse'' the crowd chanted before changing the
refrain to ``Keep Hope Alive'' _ Jackson's slogan for his political
efforts to come.
   Winpisinger hailed Jackson as the ``personification of feeling
and reason uited'' and for ``telling it like it is.''
   ``It is a singular experience and honor to stand before you
tonight to place in nomination the name of the one person in this
vast nation who has roused the moral conscience of the populace and
our party,'' he said, ``who has shown us the way to thaw the ice of
indifference, smug self-satisfaction and meanness that too long has
masked the heartbeat of America; who has ignited the passionate
fires of justice in our souls as no other contemporary has; the man
who has dared sound our call to greatness.''
   ``He has forced new issues, and new ways of thinking about old
issues into public view and the political dialogue.''
   ``Yes, this is a man of history _ a mover and shaker in the
power struggles of freedom and tyranny _ of democracy and
autocracy,'' Winpisinger said. ``This man knows what justice on the
job means. He has long recognized that without equal economic
opportunity and economic rights, there can be no real political
democracy, no real freedom.''
   The union leader detailed Jackson's long struggle on behalf of
working Americans, a record that was a key to his effort to win the
votes of blue collar workers during the primary season.
   ``He has seized history by the mane,'' he said. ``He has been
there with the workers on the picket lines, when they've been shut
out in the cold. He was there in Wisconsin at Cudahy with the
packing house workers. And he was there with the International
Association of Machinists and aerospace workers at Rome Cable in
the bitter cold of an early upstate New York winter.''

   A $27,000 fireworks display lit up the sky over
The Omni arena to celebrate the nomination of Michael Dukakis as
the Democratic presidential candidate.
   Officials with the Democratic National Convention contracted
with the nationally famous fireworks specialist Felix Grucci of New

   A twin-engine charter plane reportedly
operated by the CIA crashed and burst into flames, killing the
pilot, during takeoff Wednesday at Washington-Dulles International
Airport, officials said.
   Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority spokesman Dave Hess
said the propeller-driven aircraft went down at about 4 p.m. EDT at
the end of the easternmost runway of the airport.
   ``It was about 400 to 500 feet above the runway,'' eyewitness
Brian DePoorter said in a telephone interview with WUSA-TV. ``It
came almost to a stop in the air. It stalled in a nose-up position
and it sort of cartwheeled toward the left, dove straight down into
the ground and immediately burst into flames.''
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Pat Cariseo said the
pilot was believed to be the only person on board. The victim's
name was not immediately released, pending notification of kin.
   Hess said the plane was owned by Fairways Corp., a charter
service based at Washington's National Airport. It was en route to
National when the crash occurred.
   The Washington Post, citing unnamed aviation sources, said
Fairways is operated by the CIA.
   Bill Baker, a CIA spokesman, said the agency ``cannot confirm or
deny any contractual or proprietary relationship'' with Fairways
Corp.

<HEAD>US Objects To Soviet Conditions On Offer to Scrap Radar Facility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is objecting to the
strings the Soviets attached to their offer to dismantle the
disputed Krasnoyarsk radar complex in Siberia.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley on Wednesday said
the Soviet Union should meet its obligations under the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty by agreeing to scrap the facility
``without delay and without conditions.''
   On Tuesday, Viktor P. Karpov, the Soviet foreign ministry's top
arms control specialist, said the Soviets would dismantle the radar
complex if the two governments resolved their differences over the
ABM accord.
   ``If an understanding to abide by the ABM treaty, as signed in
1972, is reached, the Soviet Union will be ready to dismantle the
Krasnoyarsk radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on
the part of the United States,'' Karpov said.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the Krasnoyarsk facility should be dismantled without any
strings attached.
   ``The fact is that we have long said the Krasnoyarsk radar is a
violation of the ABM treaty and should be dismantled,'' he said.
``We welcome their remarks in the sense that they do acknowledge
that it is a violation of the ABM treaty. ... And in that
acknowledgement we believe ought to be recognition that it should
be torn down, but no strings and no deals.''
   Karpov's offer seemed to be a Soviet concession, since the
Soviets previously had insisted on disrupting U.S. plans to upgrade
radars in Britain and Greenland that Moscow had questioned.
   Mrs. Oakley said Krasnoyarsk would be one of the central topics
of the review of the treaty the two sides are obliged to hold by
October. ``We are concerned about a variety of Soviet ABM-related
activities that suggest the U.S.S.R. may be preparing a territorial
defense,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The treaty constrains U.S. and Soviet anti-missile defenses on
the theory the prospect of devastating retaliation might deter a
potential aggressor.
   Reagan contends the steps taken so far by the United States to
develop a shield against Soviet rockets _ the so-called Star Wars
defense _ are consistent even with a ``broad interpretation'' of
the treaty. But critics say he may be preparing to abort it before
he leaves office next January.
   James P. Rubin, research director of the private Arms Control
Association, said the Soviet offer to dismantle Krasnoyarsk
``appears to be eminently reasonable.'' He said ``as long as the
administration clings to its illegal re-interpretation of the ABM
treaty the U.S. demand that Krasnoyarsk be dismantled will have a
hollow ring to it.''
   Rubin said Krasnoyarsk was in violation of the treaty, but its
military significance was small. ``If the United States proceeds to
declare Krasnoyarsk a material breach of the treaty it will be
clear to all they are seeking to scuttle the treaty,'' he said.
   The National Campaign to Save the ABM treaty, a coalition of
former U.S. negotiators and other private citizens, said U.S.
security interests ``dictate that the two nations discuss radar
compliance generally and seek a negotiated solution to the
Krasnoyarsk violation before the administration takes the drastic
step of charging a material breach.''
   While Reagan charged in two reports to Congress that Krasnoyarsk
violates the 1972 accord, he has not decided whether to declare it
a material breach. That is a legal step that could permit the
United States to breach other provisions of the treaty, which is
considered a bedrock of arms control efforts.

   Universal Pictures says a $10 million offer to
buy the controversial film ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' so it
can be destroyed is a threat to constitutional rights.
   In a full-page advertisement in Thursday's editions of The New
York Times, The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, the
studio rejected the offer by Bill Bright, founder-president of San
Bernardino, Calif.-based Campus Crusade for Christ.
   ``While we understand the deep feelings and convictions which
have prompted this offer, we believe that to accept it would
threaten the fundamental freedoms of religion and expression
promised to all Americans under our Constitution,'' said the
advertisement, which was in the form of a letter to Bright.
   ``In the United States, no one sect or coalition has the power
to set boundaries around each person's freedom to explore religious
and philosophical questions whether through speech, books or
film,'' the ad said.
   ``These freedoms protect all of us. They are precious. They are
not for sale.''
   Bright offered to reimburse the studio's estimated $10 million
expenditure on the movie if Universal turns over all copies of the
film so they can be destroyed.
   The studio says ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' is a look at
the human side of Jesus. The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese,
who once studied for the priesthood, and stars Willem Dafoe as
Jesus, Barbara Hershey as Mary Magdalene and Harvey Keitel as Judas
Iscariot.
   In a dream sequence, Jesus comes down off the cross and has a
sexual relationship with Mary Magdelene.
   In its advertisement, Universal said, ``Only in totalitarian
states are all people forced to accept one version of truth. In any
case, Martin Scorsese has stated clearly that his film is a work of
fiction and that it is based on a novel, not the Gospels.
   ``It makes no claim whatsoever to be any more than a reflection
of his own personal exploration.''
   The advertisement said Bright did not attend a July 12 screening
in New York for religious leaders.
   It said many leaders ``were not offended by the film and even
felt that it could be a tool for fruitful discussion.''

<HEAD>Would-be Nun Says She Was Brainwashed At Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former nun whose family abducted her last
month from a renegade New York convent says she was brainwashed
there and is grateful to be home.
   ``Brainwashing is an information disease,'' said Mary Susan
Greve, the former Sister Mary Cecelia. ``It's when you don't have
information, you don't have the whole picture.
   ``That's why I can say I was happy at the convent. I only had
their side of the story. And now I am happy to be back home _
happier than I was _ because I have the whole picture.''
   Ms. Greve, 22, of Cincinnati, was dragged by her family from the
St. Joseph Novitiate Convent in Roundtop, N.Y., on June 26.
   In an interview published in Wednesday's editions of The
Cincinnati Post, Ms. Greve said she was sometimes unhappy after
entering the convent in September 1986. In her second year as a
nun, she felt more comfortable but was then pressured when
relations deteriorated between her family and the convent's
spiritual leader, the Rev. Clarence Kelly.
   Members of her family were longtime followers of Kelly. But they
became disturbed at his conservative practices, which were not
sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church in Rome, and left his
congregation.
   Kelly has maintained Ms. Greve was brainwashed by her family
into believing the convent was a cult. The church, however, has
said little since New York police dropped charges against the
family.
   ``I'm not going to go back to a convent,'' Ms. Greve said. She
maintains her faith, saying, ``What people don't understand is that
the Catholic faith is a way of life, and that is how I plan to live
my life.''
   She wants to finish college to get the teaching degree she left
half-completed when she joined the convent.
   The traditional religious order at the convent follows the
teachings of the Roman Catholic Church before Vatican II, which
gave bishops a greater influence in church affairs, gave the laity
a more active part in the liturgy, and liberalized church positions
with regard to non-Catholic and non-Christian faiths.
   On Tuesday, she taped an interview for the ``Phil Donahue
Show.'' The show, televised Wednesday, pitted her; her mother,
Susan; and her brother David, against Kelly.
   She sat quietly during the show, but spoke up when questioned
and interrupted at the show's end to make her point.
   ``May I say something? I want to say I'm very thankful that my
parents and brothers cared enough about me to do this,'' she said.
``My life wouldn't be the same if they hadn't.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Unsealing Defense Probe Documents Would `Harm Process'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge who refused to order the
release of documents related to the probe of alleged fraud on
Pentagon defense contracts said public disclosure of the
information would ``harm the process'' of the investigation.
   U.S. District Judge Claude A. Hilton on Wednesday rejected a
motion by the Washington Times to unseal the affidavits that
triggered judicial authorization of dozens of searches by federal
agents around the country on June 14.
   The government's investigation centers around allegations that
defense contractors and private defense consultants, many of them
former Pentagon employees, bribed Defense Department employees for
inside information considered crucial to winning
multimillion-dollar contracts.
   Representing the newspaper, Jerome Barron told Hilton that ``the
massive publicity already sought by the government in the middle of
June has put all defense contractors under a cloud.''
   He said the best way to clear the air is to reveal what
information the government has. Barron also argued that release of
information could permit ``corrective action to be undertaken.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica prevailed in his argument
that release of the material could tip off prospective defendants
and ``lead to destruction of property'' not yet obtained by
investigators.
   ``There have been no charges filed, no indictments. ... The
government is in the middle of a grand jury,'' he told Hilton.
   Hilton agreed, saying, ``It seems to me that release of this
information now would harm the process.''
   While conceding the case has great public interest, Aronica said
``there's a greater public interest and that is that this
investigation move forward with diligence and dispatch.''
   Barron said he didn't know if Hilton's ruling would be appealed.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, back on the
campaign trail after a four-day fishing vacation, says he can take
all the ``ugly stuff'' Democrats dish out at their convention,
claiming it may backfire on them in the fall.
   ``If you just go nasty, go ugly, that isn't an effective way to
do business,'' the vice president said, while pleading he had only
secondhand knowledge of attacks on him by a succession of speakers
at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   Bush said he'd neither watched nor listened to any part of the
Democratic convention while on the fishing trip in Wyoming.
However, aides said Bush watched the convention briefly Wednesday
night and saw Michael Dukakis' name placed in nomination.
   ``This name-calling isn't going to get anyone anything. Maybe it
will backfire on them,'' he told reporters when he appeared at a
Ukrainian cultural center in this Detroit suburb, where he
delivered a speech commemorating ``Captive Nations Week.''
   ``I've got broad shoulders,'' the certain GOP presidential
nominee said. ``They've got to get in line to say ugly stuff. ...
The concentration of trying to tear me down, it might show a little
desperation.''
   Told that Democratic conventioneers were asking, ``Where was
George?'' a reference mostly to the vice president's efforts to
disassociate himself from some of the Reagan administration's major
problems, Bush responded: ``Four days in the wilderness is the
answer.''
   ``I don't want to be cute with you, but I've been out of contact
for four nights and three days,'' he told reporters.
   ``We stayed in the same tent. ... We caught a lot of fish, we
went to bed early and had a minimal discussion of politics,'' he
said of his days in the Wyoming wilderness with his chief political
mentor, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III.
   Bush said he has decided on a process for selecting a running
mate, but intends to make the choice ``without a lot of high
visibility and show business.''
   And, while saying ``we're not in the list business yet,'' Bush
said that his former GOP rival, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, ``would be
on any list, just because he's so widely respected.''
   Bush was to attend GOP fund-raisers today in Charlotte, N.C.,
and in Greenville, S.C.
   Bush defended his decision to campaign during the final days of
the Democratic convention _ a break with a tradition in which
candidates cease campaigning during the other party's convention.
   Noting that he had also been criticized for dropping out of
sight for four days on his fishing trip, Bush said he did not think
his activities would upstage the Democrats.
   ``I'm not going to rain on their parade,'' he said.
   The vice president repeatedly refused to comment on specific
allegations raised in Atlanta. ``I'm not good at being a slash and
burn candidate,'' he said. ``Why respond to a bunch of frantic
name-callers?''
   Told that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had attacked him as a
do-nothing vice president, Bush said: ``The good thing about the
absolute wilderness is you don't have to listen to Ted Kennedy. I
recommend it.''
   In his speech Wednesday to the largely Ukrainian-American
audience, Bush declared, ``America's work will never truly be done
until all the captive nations and peoples of this earth are set
free.''
   He said that if Congress didn't soon vote support for
anti-government Contra forces in Nicaragua, that nation would
become ``another tragic entry into the list of captive nations.''
   ``Congress has been shameful and destructive on this issue,''
Bush said.
   The vice president, who also appeared at a GOP fund-raising
dinner at a private residence here Wednesday evening, planned to
campaign in Wisconsin and New Jersey on Friday, Tennessee and
Florida on Saturday and in New Mexico on Sunday.

<HEAD>Study: Chewing Tobacco Elevates Nicotine Levels More Than
Cigarettes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarter-ounce wad of chewing tobacco kept
in the mouth half an hour produces about as much nicotine in the
bloodstream as smoking three cigarettes, a University of California
researcher reported.
   Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a UC professor of medicine and chief of
pharmacology at San Francisco General Hospital, said his study may
even underestimate the amount of nicotine absorbed in the
bloodstream because some users of chewing tobacco and snuff keep it
in their mouths for hours.
   A half-ounce chunk of tobacco kept in the mouth for an hour or
so could cause as much absorption of nicotine as eight to nine
cigarettes, Benowitz said Wednesday.
   His report is based on measurements of smokeless tobacco made
during a four-day study involving 10 volunteers. It is being
published in the July issue of the Clinical Phamacology and
Therapeutics journal.
   Nicotine is the most addictive chemical in tobacco and has been
linked to such health dangers as increased blood pressure and heart
rate, as well as damage of blood vessel walls.

   Wyoming firefighters battling a nearly 15,000-acre blaze two
miles from Yellowstone National Park gathered equipment to create
an artificial rain storm Wednesday to keep the fire from jumping
lines, while California firefighters struggled with two blazes
believed started by arson.
   Fires also raged on in Alaska, Colorado and Utah.
   In Wyoming, the fire had consumed at least 14,857 acres of
Bridger-Teton National Forest's Teton Wilderness, and officials
expected it to cross into the park in the next few days.
   Spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said if the fire does cross over onto
park land it will not be fought because of the park's policy of
letting natural fires burn.
   ``We haven't even set a date or estimation for containment or
control,'' said forest spokesman Doug Huntington.
   The more than 600 firefighters have made inroads, but ``the
behavior of the fire is running them ragged, especially in the
blowdown areas'' of downed timber on the fire's southern edge
around Enos Lake, said Dale Jarrell, the incident commander.
   Officials were hoping on Thursday to start up a sprinkler system
with marine pumps and hoses to moisten the Yellowstone Meadows, on
the border of Yellowstone National Park and some 2 miles from the
flames, said Fire Information Officer Ed Waldapfel.
   Yellowstone officials already were monitoring a half-dozen
smaller fires covering more than 15,000 acres scattered throughout
the park.
   While all of Yellowstone's roads and front country campsites
were open, camping restrictions were imposed throughout the
backcountry, and some backcountry campsites were closed.
   Two blazes in northern California's Calaveras County had burned
at least 9,000 acres by Wednesday evening, forestry officials said.
   The fires on Tuesday destroyed at least three houses, a mobile
home and other structures worth about $500,000, California
Department of Forestry spokesman Robert Watson said at the fire
camp in Railroad Flat. Officials said they suspect arson although
they have not found any incendiary devices. The blazes erupted at
about the same time and followed arson fires set in the area Monday.
   Crews plan to dig 13 miles of control lines that will allow the
fires to burn at least 16,000 acres, said chief state fire
spokeswoman Karen Terrill. The blazes were about 40 percent
contained by evening.
   Although the two fires are separate, crews are treating them as
one in their strategy. They are burning southeast toward the
mountain resort community of Arnold, on Highway 4, the town of
Sheep Ranch, and scattered homes and subdivisions. The area is
about 150 miles east of San Francisco in the Sierra Nevada.
   Rugged terrain, gusting winds and heavy smoke hindered
firefighters, who got a slight respite from the 100-plus degree
weather of previous days when temperatures eased into the mid-90s.
   Elsewhere in the state, a 4,700-acre fire in Los Padres National
Forest jumped fire lines Wednesday, dashing hopes that the blaze
could be contained by nightfall.
   ``The wind kicked up on us this afternoon,'' said Earl Clayton,
spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service. ``We've lost containment and
we don't know when we'll control the fire now.''
   The blaze, near San Luis Obispo, began Sunday.
   In Colorado, all but two of the fires that have charred more
than 21,000 acres since Saturday have been declared under control.
   A 3,100-acre fire near the Dinosaur National Monument in
northwest Colorado was contained Wednesday night, while
firefighters were scrambling to douse a 145-acre brush fire east of
Glenwood Springs, said Teresa Ross, a dispatcher with the Bureau of
Land Management at Craig.
   Firefighters in eastern Utah controlled two mountain blazes,
only to be sent to the southern part of the state, where a fire of
undetermined size broke out Wednesday afternoon in mountains
between Cedar City and Beaver.
   In Alaska, where fires have burned 1,300 square miles _ larger
than Rhode Island _ this season, the state Fire Service has left
most blazes to burn themselves out. It has been monitoring about 50
wildfires, some of them weeks old.
   The biggest is a 225,000-acre blaze 60 miles north of Fairbanks
that approached the Alaska pipeline earlier this month but was
stopped about 12 miles from it. The pipeline is covered with
heavy-gauge metal and was not threatened, Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. said.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are studying the
wreckage of a twin-engine passenger plane to determine the cause of
a crash that killed the plane's pilot shortly after takeoff.
   The propeller-driven aircraft went down Wednesday afternoon on
the end of the eastern-most runway at Washington-Dulles
International Airport, said Dave Hess, a spokesman for the
Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority.
   Hess said the plane was owned by Fairways Corp., a charter
service based at nearby National Airport, and was en route to
National when the crash occurred.
   The Washington Post, citing unidentified aviation sources,
reported in today's editions that Fairways is operated by the CIA.
Agency spokesman Bill Baker said the agency could not confirm or
deny a relationship with the corporation.
   The pilot, believed to be the only person on board, was not
immediately identified.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the
crash, and NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said the pilot ``issued
no distress radio signal to anybody.''
   Witness Brian De Poorter, who works in a nearby building, said
the plane ``came almost to a stop in the air. It stalled in a
nose-up position and it sort of cartwheeled toward the left, dove
straight down into the ground and immediately burst into flames.''

   American pop star Michael Jackson chatted with
rapt youngsters at London's Hospital for Sick Children and donated
money to a fund to finance the construction of a new building to
rehouse the facility.
   ``His visit clearly meant a lot to them and to the parents who
were there,'' hospital spokeswoman Jenny Uprichard said Wednesday.
   ``There was a great shout of excitement when he arrived with his
party in two large black cars. Parents and children sitting on
balconies around the wards recognized him straight away,'' she said.
   Wearing a black leather outfit, Jackson, 29, spent 70 minutes
touring wards, including the hospital's plastic surgery unit.
   She said Jackson made a six-figure donation to the Wishing Well
fund, which she said is raising about $51 million for a new
building to rehouse the hospital. She refused to say how much
Jackson donated.

   His opponent Michael Spinks may disagree, but
Mike Tyson is cuddly, says his wife, Robin Givens.
   The heavyweight champion, who knocked out Spinks last month in
91 seconds, is ``shy, sometimes insecure, vulnerable and naive,''
Givens says in an interview in the Aug. 8 issue of US magazine.
   ``I mean, he's a baby, he's cuddly,'' said the actress who
married Tyson in February.
   Since the surprise wedding, Givens and her mother, Ruth Roper,
have been accused of causing a rift between the champion and his
manager, Bill Cayton. The Cayton-Tyson dispute is now in court.
   ``We've been criticized in every single way for being exactly
what we are, which is a family,'' Givens said.
   Despite her upscale upbringing and Tyson's Bronx background,
``we've been like the Three Musketeers and (Tyson) fit perfectly
into that,'' she said. ``Michael's never had a family, just never.''

   Runner Zola Budd, who returned
to South Africa two months ago after abandoning an attempt to join
the British Olympic team, plans to study for a bachelor of arts
degree at a local university.
   Miss Budd had renounced her South African citizenship and moved
to Great Britain to participate in the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles, where she was involved in a spectacular collision with
U.S. running star Mary Decker.
   Miss Budd, picketed by anti-apartheid groups, denied maintaining
ties to South Africa, where her family lives. But she quit the
British team and returned to South Africa after her suspension from
international competition for attending a track meet in South
Africa.
   The South African Press Association said Wednesday that Miss
Budd would study political science, ethnology, communications and
sociology at the University of the Orange Free State, but would not
begin classes until she recovered from bronchitis.

   Pee-wee Herman, the bow-tied comic whose
bizarre antics on Saturday morning TV entertained a generation of
youngsters, has been given a sidewalk star in the Hollywood Walk of
Fame.
   Herman, whose real name is Paul Reubens, unveiled the star
Wednesday with a giggle and received a rousing cheer from 400 fans
on Hollywood Boulevard.
   ``I want to thank everybody I stepped on to get to the top, now
they can walk on me,'' the entertainer said.
   Many of the fans were small children carrying Pee-wee dolls, and
there was at least one adult Pee-wee look-alike.
   The dedication was timed to coincide with Friday's release of
Pee-wee's movie ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' featuring the whiny,
little-kid character falling in love with a bewitching beauty on a
trapeze.
   It was the 1,874th star dedicated in the Walk of Fame along
Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. Paramount Pictures, sponsor of
the curbside honor, paid $3,500 for the Herman star.

   Cadets at Vernon Military Camp
received a surprise inspection from actor-director Martin Sheen.
   Sheen dropped in Tuesday to look over the Canadian Forces camp
185 miles northeast of Vancouver as a possible set for a new movie,
``Count A Lonely Cadence.''
   The film tells of the coming of age of a young soldier in the
1950s, to be played by Sheen's son, Charlie Sheen.
   The setting is a U.S. Army base in West Germany and revolves
around time spent by soldiers in a stockade.
   ``This facility looks very nearly perfect,'' said Sheen, who
accepted an invitation to inspect cadets on parade during his visit.
   Sheen is working on another movie, ``Personal Choice,'' in
Vancouver.
   ``My son Emilio Estevez was here doing `Stakeout' a year ago and
he encouraged me to come up to Canada.''

   A federal judge has dismissed a $500,000
lawsuit by an ex-Pentagon official who claimed he lost job with a
defense contractor after Navy officials complained about his calls
for cuts in the defense budget.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude M. Hilton on Tuesday dismissed
the suit brought by Lawrence J. Korb, who joined Raytheon Co. in
1985 after four years as Pentagon manpower chief.
   Korb had filed suit against former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman
Jr. and his assistant secretary for research, Melvyn R. Paisley.
Paisley is under investigation for alleged fraud in the
government's current probe of military contracting.
   Korb had alleged that he was deprived of his right of free
speech because he was fired by Raytheon after Navy leaders objected
to his public calls for defense cuts.
   In dismissing the suit, Hilton ruled that ``there is no evidence
that defendants threatened or coerced Raytheon to induce the
company to silence or remove Dr. Korb and no causal link between
defendants' conduct and plaintiff's termination.''
   Hilton also dismissed similar allegations by Korb against
Everett Pyatt, assistant Navy secretary for shipbuilding, and Carl
M. Smith, minority staff director of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.

   Torrential rains caused floods and dozens of
landslides that killed six people in western Japan and 28 in South
Korea, officials said today. Hundreds of people had to evacuate
their homes.
   Rescuers recovered the body of a 91-year-old woman buried under
a house destroyed by a landslide in Kake, a town in Hiroshima
Prefecture 420 miles southwest of Tokyo, said prefectural police
spokesman Hajime Tachibana.
   Tachibana said five other people in the town were killed when
their houses in the mountainous region were destroyed by landslides
and floods from Wednesday to early today.
   He said nine people were missing, including three whose car
plunged from a damaged road into a rain-swollen river.
   In neighboring Shimane Prefecture, which had 37 landslides,
1,633 people were evacuated to schools and other temporary shelters
and about 630 houses were flooded, police said.
   In Seoul, the capital of South Korea, the National
Counter-Disaster Center said 16 people were confirmed dead
nationwide, with 12 others missing and presumed dead. The
fatalities raised the confirmed death toll to 32 since the rainy
season began July 8.
   Center officials said hundreds of houses were flooded in the
latest downpours, which measured up to 8 inches.
   Property damage was estimated at $45 million, with most
casualties caused by floods and landslides.
   In Yongwol, 75 miles east of Seoul, officials said six people
were killed when landslides buried their homes under tons of mud.
   Landslides smashed a hillside home in the southern city of
Yongju, killing three family members, including two children.
   Rescue workers dug through debris and homes destroyed by
landslides in two other provincial areas, but no survivors were
reported, officials said.

   A federal judge says America was
sending a signal to drug traffickers when he sentenced Carlos
Lehder Rivas to life imprisonment without parole for smuggling tons
of cocaine into the United States.
   ``Cocaine is viewed as a national tragedy in this country,''
U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton told the Colombian drug dealer
Wednesday. ``Those who profit from this are the worst kinds of
offenders.''
   The harsh sentence, life plus 135 years in prison and fines
totaling $350,000, was ``a signal of our society'' that it will
strongly punish those fueling ``this cancer'' of drugs, Melton said.
   The judge also said Lehder's criminal motivation was greed,
adding that he showed ``no concern for the destruction of others.''
   There was no visible reaction from Lehder, who wore a gray
business suit.
   Lehder, 38, a reputed leader of Colombia's violent Medellin
Cartel, was sentenced for smuggling 3.3 tons of cocaine from his
homeland via the Bahamas to rural airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   He was convicted on 11 counts of conspiracy, importation of
cocaine and possession with intent to distribute. Melton also
ordered the confiscation of Lehder's possessions in the Bahamas:
three homes, an airstrip, hotel, condominium and marina.
   The seizure is in dispute, with the Bahamian government
contending the United States has no right to the property and that
it intended to assume possession.
   Lehder contended he had been ``a hostage'' to prosecutor Robert
Merkle, who resigned as U.S. attorney for central Florida shortly
after the seven-month trial to run for the Republican U.S. Senate
nomination.
   Lehder claimed Merkle used him as a symbol of evil to generate
``free publicity for his Senate campaign.''
   He charged he had been kidnapped and illegally brought to the
United States because he had been a political leader in Colombia,
working to overthrow the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.
   Outside the courtroom, Merkle's replacement, U.S. Attorney Joe
Magri, dismissed Lehder's allegations.
   He said the judge had ``fairly, justly and appropriately socked
it to a hoodlum.''
   The heavy sentence ``sends a clear message that we're serious
about stopping narcotics traffic,'' Magri said, calling Lehder a
``cocaine narco-terrorist.''
   The defendant, who said he had dual citizenship in the United
States and Colombia, asked Melton to deport him to Colombia or
Germany.
   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon had asked the
judge to impose a 20-year sentence at most, which they said would
be four times longer than the terms being served by the smugglers
who testified against Lehder.
   They said Lehder would appeal the conviction and sentence.
   After listening to almost four hours of arguments and objections
from Lehder's attorneys to pre-sentence reports, Melton told the
defendant that the government had presented ``monumental amounts of
incriminating evidence against you.''
   Testimony during the lengthy trial alleged that Bahamian
officials, including Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling, helped
Lehder's drug ring smuggle more than 20 tons of cocaine into the
United States.
   Pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations.
   Lehder was arrested and extradited to the United States last
year after a gunbattle at his mansion in Medellin.
   He also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the cartel,
and there is a sealed indictment against him in Los Angeles. But
officials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried on
those charges.
   Co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., a
pilot in the drug-smuggling ring, stood silently earlier in the day
as he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $25,000 for his
conviction on a single conspiracy count. Government witnesses had
testified that he ferried 2,500 pounds of cocaine on at least seven
flights from the Bahamas.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Japan have reached
agreement on a pact to end or relax Japanese import quotas on
various U.S. processed food products.
   Under the accord, Japan will end quotas on seven food categories
by April 1, 1990, and partially lift quotas to substantially
increase access or provide compensation on four other categories.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said late Wednesday
the pact ``is a further example that with persistence and
perseverance the United States can open markets abroad for our
products.''
   ``I am pleased that we were able to finally reach an ...
agreement to implement the report of GATT, the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which ruled that Japan's quotas were illegal
under international trading rules,'' he said.
   ``This sets a precedent for other pending cases we have before
the GATT in which the United States is denied access to foreign
agricultural markets.''
   The Japanese Embassy said full agreement was reached Wednesday
after a final three-day round of negotiations between Yeutter's
office and a delegation from Tokyo's Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries.
   It ends a dispute spawned by a 1986 U.S. complaint against
quotas in 12 categories of processed foods.
   After Japan blocked the formation of a panel of inquiry twice, a
panel report last November found the quotas on 10 categories were
illegal by GATT standards.
   The report, adopted by the GATT council on Feb. 2, allowed Japan
to continue its import restrictions on two categories _ peanuts,
and dried peas and beans _ if the quotas were increased in other
areas.
   Yeutter said he expected last year's $480 million in U.S.
exports to Japan to double by the end of the three-year settlement
period, with unlimited export potential throughout the next decade.

   American soldiers exchanged gunfire
with intruders this week at the same fuel storage depot where
similar shooting occurred in April, the U.S. Southern Command said.
   No one was reported injured in the Tuesday afternoon and evening
firefights at the Arraijan Tank Farm near Howard Air Force Base,
the command said in a statement Wednesday.
   It said there have been several intrusions since the beginning
of June.
   The statement said a Marine patrol encountered two armed
intruders at 3 p.m. Tuesday outside the tank farm.
   The intruders failed to heed an order to stop and fled into
dense jungle when a Marine fired shots into the air, the Southern
Command said.
   Five hours later, a group of Marines patrolling the eastern side
of the fuel depot ran into six intruders, two of whom were wearing
night vision devices, the statement said.
   The group began encircling the Marines, who ``determined the
maneuver was hostile and opened fire. The intruders returned
fire,'' the statement said.
   The Marines and intruders exchanged another round of gunfire
before the group stopped firing and fled, it said.
   The command said the shooting incidents each ``lasted only
several minutes in their totality'' in the span of about an hour.
   The statement did not speculate on the intruders' identities.
``An initial search of the area only revealed footprints,'' and
authorities were conducting ``a more detailed investigation,'' it
said.
   The 807-acre fuel storage depot is in a hilly, jungled area
about five miles west of Panama City and about 1{ miles west of
Howard air base.
   In April, the Southern Command contended there were four
intrusions at the depot by what one spokesman called ``highly
trained professionals.''
   A Marine sentry was killed April 11 when fellow guards
accidentally shot him as they were investigating the first of the
alleged intrusions _ by what the command described as eight men in
dark uniforms.
   Neither the Panamanian government nor its Defense Forces had any
immediate comment on Tuesday's incidents.
   In April, they ridiculed U.S. accounts of intrusions, saying the
Marines apparently fired at ``swaying palm trees.''
   The Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who was indicted in the United States in February on charges of
trafficking in Colombian cocaine.
   The Reagan administration has for months sought the ouster of
Noriega, Panama's de facto leader, through a series of economic
sanctions and unsuccessful negotiations.

   A strong earthquake jolted eastern Taiwan
today and triggered a rockslide in a marble mine that killed one
miner and injured another, police said.
   The tremor was felt in Taipei, where houses shook violently.
   Police in Hualien, 110 miles southeast of the capital, said the
two men were working in the mine this morning when the earthquake
struck. An undetermined number of other miners escaped.
   The Central Weather Bureau said the earthquake registered 6.4 on
the Richter scale. The epicenter was at sea about 19 miles
southeast of Hualien.
   Police identified the dead miner as Lin Chih-chuan, 20. The
injured miner, Tu Lung-hwa, 45, was hospitalized for a head injury
but his condition was not known.
   The official Broadcasting Corp. of China said a landslide
blocked a major highway in Hualien, and workers were trying to
clear it for traffic.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas, and a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

<TEXT>
   Illinois Republican Gov. James Thompson came to
this convention city to taunt the Democrats, but wound up hinting
that he'd make a good running mate for GOP candidate George Bush.
   As the Democrats embraced the ticket of Michael Dukakis and
Lloyd Bentsen, who differ on a number of issues, Thompson stressed
his compatibility with the vice president.
   ``George Bush and I agree on a lot of things,'' said Thompson, a
four-term governor who was an early Bush supporter.
   ``I'm too moderate for some people, but I've never been told I'm
too moderate for George Bush,'' he said.
   Thompson was careful to avoid sounding overly eager as a job
applicant. Vice presidential hopefuls traditionally refrain from
tooting their own horns.
   ``There are a number of qualified candidates,'' Thompson said.
``There's no lack of talent in our party.''
   Thompson's support gave Bush a boost in the Illinois primary,
where he thrashed his GOP rivals after an impressive showing in the
South.
   Since then, Thompson has been mentioned as a vice presidential
prospect, and ``Thompson-Bush'' bumper stickers have appeared in
Springfield, the Illinois capital.
   Thompson was in Atlanta on Wednesday to carry the GOP banner. He
clearly relished the task, signaling what's certain to be a
Republican effort to focus attention on Jesse Jackson as part of
the Democratic team.
   ``Gov. Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in this
campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps higher
than his nominal running mate, Lloyd Bentsen,'' Thompson told
reporters.
   Thompson said it was a clever strategy by Dukakis to offer
Bentsen as ``the soothing, reassuring conservative.''
   But he said, ``my guess is those two partners of the troika,
Dukakis and Jackson, will soon leave Bentsen in the dust.''
   Thompson added: ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson
whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ...
I think that's the question the American people need to have
answered.''

   Some senators are known for what they believe,
but Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas is best known for what he has done
in a 40-year political career _ win elections and then get the job
done in office.
   ``I know there are those who would take perhaps the political
version of a St. Ignatius approach, saying that they want pure
ideology.'' he says. ``And if you practice that to the ultimate,
you finally have yourself a party of one, and you sure don't win
any elections.''
   Bentsen, the Democrats' vice presidential choice, believes in
winning.
   The son of a wealthy landowner in the Rio Grande Valley. Lloyd
Millard Bentsen Jr. was a 24-year-old World War II veteran when he
won his first office, Hidalgo County Judge.
   At 27, in 1948, he won a seat in the U.S. House of
Representatives, making him the youngest congressman at the time.
During his first term, he cast a vote against the poll tax, which
was being used to keep blacks from voting. He was one of just two
Southern congressmen to vote that way, and he frequently now points
to that as an example of his strong commitment to civil rights.
   People were beginning to talk about Bentsen as a governor or
senator, but in 1954, he dropped out of politics after only three
terms in the House.
   Bentsen and his wife Beryl Ann, a former fashion model whom he
married while in the service, moved back to Texas to raise their
two sons and one daughter. Over the next 16 years, Bentsen built a
successful insurance and investment business that left him a
millionaire.
   His father, now 94, told him if he left politics he would never
go back. But the bug bit him again in 1970.
   Bentsen entered the Democratic primary and upset incumbent Sen.
Ralph Yarborough. In the general election, he defeated Republican
Rep. George Bush, a feat he's now trying to repeat in the national
arena.
   As a senator, Bentsen has gained a reputation as a lawmaker's
lawmaker, a dealmaker _ not always the stuff presidential
candidates are made of. He found that out in 1976, when he made a
run for the Democratic nomination for president and was defeated by
the former Georgia governor, Jimmy Carter. He kept his Senate seat
though, and was re-elected with a powerful 60 percent six years ago.
   As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee for the past two
years, Bentsen has racked up an impressive string of
accomplishments.
   The panel has approved welfare reform legislation currently
before a House-Senate conference committee, and President Reagan
has signed a Bentsen-pushed catastrophic illness protection bill
expanding the Medicare system.
   The huge trade bill vetoed by Reagan also came through his
committee, including the 60-day notice for plant closings that led
to a Reagan veto. The Democratic Congress just sent the notice
provision back to Reagan as a separate bill _ and campaign issue.
   Tucked into the trade bill is a provision repealing the windfall
profits tax on oil, an example of Bentsen's successful blend of
local interests and national issues. It's part of a theme that runs
through Bentsen's career _ compromising to get things done.
   ``Lloyd is ideal,'' says House Speaker Jim Wright, a friend for
more than three decades. ``He doesn't go overboard in any
direction.''
   Bentsen's not the back-slapping, touchy-feely kind of politician
typical of Capitol Hill. His style is often described as aloof and
patrician, something he disputes by citing his campaign swings
through the barrios of south Texas where he speaks with the
residents in fluent Spanish.
   But people still recall when a young staffer once made the
mistake of calling him Lloyd. ``We worked very hard to earn the
title Senator,'' he admonished the youth. ``Let's use it.''
   Bentsen walks the halls of the Capitol with an erect, athletic
gait that belies his 67 years. He was playing tennis only hours
before Michael Dukakis picked him up in Washington for the trip to
Atlanta.
   He has the demeanor of a conservative businessman, but his
Senate voting record has been consistently middle-of-the-road,
according to ratings given by both liberal and conservative groups.
It would be wrong to say Bentsen's priorities have drifted without
a rudder. His issues just don't cut cleanly across the ideological
spectrum between political extremes.
   Bentsen is a conservative _ certainly, compared to Dukakis _ on
national defense and foreign policy. He has voted for aid to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua and for the MX missile, spending that
Dukakis strongly opposes.
   On domestic issues, he supports prayer in schools and opposes
restrictions on handguns, again positions opposite those of his
more liberal running mate. Dukakis has called President Reagan's
1981 tax cuts a monumental mistake, but Bentsen not only voted for
them but was one of the earliest supporters of reducing business
taxes to spur economic growth, years before Reagan came to power.
   On the other hand, he was a supporter of the Equal Rights
Amendment and of legal abortions, though not always spending
federal money on them.
   And while Dukakis has been critical of Political Action
Committee fund raising, Bentsen is a master. In 1987, shortly after
becoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bentsen formed a
$10,000-a-seat ``breakfast club'' for lobbyists to raise money for
his Senate campaign.
   Bentsen, who has also supported campaign reform legislation,
quickly disbanded the club after it was made public and calls it
``a doozy'' of a mistake.
   Neither Bentsen nor Dukakis will admit to any consternation
about those differences. Indeed, Dukakis asserts that he ``doesn't
want a clone'' for a vice president. Bentsen says it's just a case
of practicing ``the politics of inclusion'' that will win the White
House for the Democrats in November.
   And that kind of pragmatic approach to politics and issues could
well be the two men's greatest commonality.
   Bentsen seems happy with his ascension to the ticket and
comfortable with it.
   Back in his days as a World War II bomber pilot, Bentsen once
was forced to land his disabled plane on a strip on the island of
Viz in the Adriatic. An armed group came out to meet the Americans.
   ``I climbed out of the plane and walked toward them, hoping they
were friendly, only to have a man about my age emerge from the
group,'' Bentsen said in an article he later wrote.
   ``I said, `Don't I know you?'''
   ``He looked (at) me and said, `Sure, you're Bentsen. I used to
sack groceries for your mother when she went to the grocery
store.'''
   He still clearly enjoys that feeling of recognition.

   They Never Run Out of Words:
   House Speaker Jim Wright had prepared his speech as chairman of
the Democratic National Convention but had only one chance to
rehearse it. So he memorized the first sentence and planned to read
the rest from the prompting device in front of the lectern.
   ``I got up there and delivered that first line with all the
enthusiasm and emotion I could muster,'' he said later. ``I looked
at the TelePrompTer for the second sentence and it was (Sen.
Robert) Byrd's speech. They had put the wrong speech on.''
   Wright said that because he hadn't brought a written text, he
had only three choices when he mounted the podium Tuesday night:
   ``I could either go ahead and muddle through it, or I could just
deliver Byrd's speech or I could just say `thank you' and sit down.
The third option probably would have been best.''
   Wright decided to wing it.

   The Big Cheeses:
   Judging from the headgear at the Democratic National Convention,
there are a lot of big cheeses in town.
   Wisconsin delegate Tom Harnisch was the first to draw notice
when he appeared on the streets at midday Wednesday wearing a
plastic hat shaped like a wedge of cheese. By the time the
convention reconvened a few hours later, others had plastic cheeses
on their heads.
   Harnisch, a former two-term Wisconsin state senator, said the
stares and occasional snide comments were worth it. After all,
Wisconsin is known as America's Dairyland and his home district has
more dairy cows than people.

<TEXT>
   Speaking of Milk:
   The Wisconsin delegation has thought of another way to advertise
its most famous export. Its state standard is decorated with a blue
and white inflatable cow.
   Not to be outdone, Hawaii decorated its standard with plastic
leis. Maine and New Hampshire decorated their standards with state
flags. Iowa's bears a bumper sticker reading ``more farms, less
arms,'' and the District of Columbia advertises ``D.C. Statehood
Now.''
   The most enticing home state advertisement in this sun-baked
city is a large, hand-written sign hanging from the balcony of the
visitor's gallery of the convention hall. It reads: ``Cool it in
Montana's Rockies. Today in Bozeman, high 84, low 55, humidity 30
percent.''

   What's In a Name?
   Missouri's Senate Democratic candidate has a familiar name, and
when his supporters wear buttons advertising his candidacy, they
get noticed. ``People were throwing stones at me and everything
else,'' says one supporter, state Rep. Bill McKenna.
   The candidate's name: Nixon. Jay, that is.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   His Name:
   Convention delegates were on familiar terms with Michael Dukakis
on Wednesday night when he was nominated as the party's 1988
standard bearer.
   Blue and white ``Dukakis'' placards waved by delegates during
floor demonstrations for the first two nights had gotten somewhat
tattered. So new ones were distributed for the climactic third
session. They read simply ``Duke! Duke! Duke!''
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   And His Face:
   On the streets of Atlanta and in the World Congress Center,
where 13,000 news people are toiling, an entrepreneur charges $5 to
pose for an instant photo next to life-sized cutouts of Dukakis and
Jesse Jackson.
   With the convention winding down and the outcome preordained,
the owner is offering to sell the cardboard figures for $695 _ $300
less than his usual asking price. He had no takers on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Houston Already Lobbying For Democrats' 1992 Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN HERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling not to say ``I told you so,'' Texans
who touted Houston as a better place than Atlanta for the
Democratic National Convention have started lobbying to capture the
party's 1992 convention.
   The pitch began on the crowded floor of The Omni arena Wednesday
night when Texas delegates donned T-shirts bearing an inviting
message to Democrats who are weary of gridlocked aisles and fights
for seats in the convention hall.
   ``We have space for you in '92,'' the shirts said.
   The space problem was dramatized when officials locked The
Omni's doors for the second consecutive night Wednesday because of
overcrowding. Some convention delegates were excluded from the
hall, at least temporarily, on both nights.
   ``We'd like to show them what a real convention center looks
like,'' said Don Ward of the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau
which is gearing up for another shot at the 1992 convention.
   Houstonians had offered their massive new George R. Brown
Convention Center as the best place for this year's convention.
Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk opted instead for Atlanta.
   Ward said the convention would have made $60 million for Houston
while providing Democrats with a more comfortable setting.
   ``The George R. Brown would contain three Omnis. You could keep
all the press and everything under one roof,'' he said.
   The 13,000-member press corps here is housed in the spacious
Georgia World Congress Center adjacent to The Omni.
   While delegates jammed the Omni floor Wednesday night for the
Michael Dukakis' presidential nomination, Houstonians including
Mayor Kathy Whitmire gathered in their convention center to watch
the proceedings in Atlanta on television.
   Texas state Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle, who joked that his
home town of Sherman has livestock barns larger than The Omni, was
among the Texans who were striving to avoid saying ``I told you
so'' in Atlanta.
   ``It's always embarrassing when anybody gets locked out of a
Democratic convention for any reason. We pride ourselves on
inclusion. It's a shame and I'm sorry it happened,'' he said.
   ``It's not the most useful hall we ever worked in,'' Slagle said
of The Omni. ``If you like being crammed in like a sardine it's a
pretty nice place to be.''
   Claire Giesen, an aide to Rep. Mike Andrews in Houston, is the
lead cheerleader for the Houston '92 effort. She observed that the
T-shirts and stickers did not mention either political party and
also could be used to lure Republicans to Houston in four years.
   Ms. Giesen complained that The Omni is ``too small'' and that
``transportation is poor,'' but she had nothing but praise for the
hot, humid weather that convention delegates endured here until
recently.
   ``The weather has been great. Perfect weather,'' she said as she
distributed stickers featuring a big blue ``92,'' which can seem
like the average humidity on a summer day in Houston.

   Here is the text of the speech delivered by
Coretta Scott King at the Democratic National Convention.
   Five weeks from today, on August 27, we will commemorate the
25th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream for America by
marching on Washington once again.
   On that August afternoon in 1963, more than 250,000 people from
all walks of life assembled in the lengthened shadow of the Lincoln
Memorial. On that day, Martin Luther King Jr. stood before the
nation and the world and declared his dream for America.
   Martin's dream was embraced by many Americans, some like Medgar
Evers, John and Bobby Kennedy and countless others already
mentioned here this week have sacrificed and even given their lives
in pursuit of that dream.
   Under Martin Luther King's Jr.'s leadership, the civil rights
movement awakened the conscience of America and achieved great
victories in the struggle for equality. His accomplishments are
much in evidence in this historic convention. The state of
Mississippi, for example, was described by Martin as ``sweltering
with the heat of injustice.'' Yet, in 1986, Mississippi elected
Michael Espy, the first grandson of a former slave, to the Congress
since Reconstruction.
   It has also sent to Georgia this week, a former Confederate
state, a fully integrated delegation to this convention, shared by
a black man. Black Americans have made great strides in the
political arena; as speakers of state legislatures, as chairs of
eight congressional committees, and there's even a black American,
William Gray, sharing the Congressional Budget Committee and this
convention's platform committee.
   And tonight, I want to pause to say, Jesse, Martin would be
proud of you. And we are all proud of you by the way you have
broadened and expanded the base of political participation in
America. So many who were formerly locked out are now locked in. As
a disciple of Martin Luther King Jr., your campaign has brought new
hope to millions who had given up on ever participating in the
political process.
   These accomplishments serve to remind us that today's dreams can
be tomorrow's reality. But we must be willing to work together, to
pray together, to struggle together in the spirit of none-violence
to fulfill Martin's dream.
   The leaders of this convention _ Gov. Michael Dukakis, Lloyd
Bentsen, Jesse Jackson and Jimmy Carter _ have beautifully
demonstrated the power of non-violence at work in the healing and
reconciliation that has taken place at this convention.
   Gov. Dukakis, I want to commend you for conducting your campaign
on a consistently high plane and spirit. I come to this convention
tonight to remind you that this is what the dream is all about. I
come also to remind you that for many Americans, the dream is still
deferred. Despite the progress of the last 25 years, something is
still wrong when 32 million Americans are living in poverty in the
richest nation on the face of the earth. And something is very
wrong when nearly 13 million of them are children. This is a
national disgrace.
   We cannot allow this to go unchallenged. As Americans, let us
take the challenge of making those whom the Bible call ``the least
of these'' _ victims of AIDS, the poor and the homeless _ a top
priority. Let us not abandon the victims of neglect.
   It would be tragic, a tragic mistake, to attract the ``haves''
to any political party at the expense of the ``have nots.'' We can
feed our hungry.
   We can provide decent housing for all of our citizens. We can
provide jobs, skills, training and day care for the poor and
unemployed so that they can put bread on their own tables.
   We can help every American who wants to work, to be productive,
to do so. We can end the violence of nuclear war, apartheid,
racism, joblessness, terrorism, drugs and the violence in our
homes, in our schools and in our streets if only we can find the
will. And we must.
   And finally, my brothers and sisters, we can be proud of our
economic prosperity and the blessings of freedom. But if we want to
be, and if we want the gospel of freedom spread and human rights
throughout the world, we must lead by our moral example. We can,
and we must, be peacemakers. I ask you, my friends: please, do not
forsake Martin's dream. And I join Jesse Jackson in appealing to
you to keep hope alive.
   I challenge you to remember the dream.
   Thank you.

   There were hugs, laughs and more than a few
nostalgic tales when former officials and staffers of Jimmy
Carter's administration got together and rehashed the ``good ol'
days.''
   ``And those were the good old days,'' said Connie Plunkett, a
former campaign worker and State Department official under Carter.
She was among 400 guests who jammed the Carter Presidential Center
for the lavishly catered reception.
   ``We're just here to have a good time, not talk politics,''
Carter said. He and his wife Rosalynn obviously were having a good
time as they circulated among the crowd.
   The guests included former Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, former
CIA director Stansfield Turner and former aides Jody Powell and
Bert Lance _ two members of the Carter inner circle affectionately
known as the ``Georgia mafia.''
   ``It's not every day you get a free drink off of Jimmy Carter,''
quipped Powell, who served as Carter's press secretary.
   Carter's three sons and daughter Amy also attended the
reception. Among important Carter administration figures who did
not show up were former Vice President Walter Mondale and White
House chief of staff Hamilton Jordan, whose mother is seriously ill.
   Muskie, who served as secretary of state during the last eight
months of Carter's term, said he had mixed emotions about his stint
in the administration.
   ``It was a damned good time,'' said the 74-year-old Muskie, who
now practices law in Washington. ``It was an exciting time but my
outstanding image of those days is of the Iranian hostage crisis. I
just wish we could have gotten those hostages out earlier.''
   Muskie also said he is happy to see that Carter is beginning to
play a more important role in the Democratic Party than he has in
recent years.
   ``From now on, I think, you'll see a different attitude about
his presidency and about him,'' he said.
   Rosalynn Carter said she felt her husband always has been
popular with rank-and-file Democrats.
   ``It was the party officials who turned against Jimmy following
his defeat in 1980,'' she said. ``I think the people always have
given him a warm reception and have seen him as a good person, even
if they didn't necessarily think he was an effective president.''
   Mrs. Carter said she enjoys being out of the pressure cooker
that is the White House. ``It's wonderful not being on stage all
the time,'' she added.
   ``I'm also enjoying this party,'' she said. ``I've talked with
people I haven't seen in years.''
   The Carters moved through the crowd separately, hugging,
laughing and chatting with friends, some of whom sought the former
president's signature on photographs or on copies of his newly
released book on trout fishing.
   At one point a friend held up her young daughter, a toddler,
whom he hugged and kissed. Carter, an indefatigable campaigner when
he was seeking the presidency in 1976, then laughed and added,
``I'm a little out of practice at this sort of thing.''
   At one point an aide stepped up and wiped the lipstick from
Carter's cheek after he was kissed by three successive admirers.
   ``This is great,'' Carter said, grinning broadly as he moved
away through the crowd, hugging, kissing and talking about those
days when a peanut farmer from Plains, Ga., was the president of
the United States of America.

   Donna Alexander's previous letters to politicians
always brought form-letter replies. But her letter to Texas
Treasurer Ann Richards got a personal response on national
television.
   ``I felt kind of embarrassed a little bit,'' said Ms. Alexander,
who watched the Monday night keynote speech while wrapping up a
Tupperware party at her home in Lorena, Texas.
   In her speech, Ms. Richards quoted at length from Ms.
Alexander's letter to her about the difficulties faced by average
families. The letter was written on a lunch break after Ms.
Alexander heard that families would be the key note in the keynote
speech.
   ``For a number of years, I've wondered if people like us are the
forgotten,'' she wrote. ``We're not the poor and we're not the
rich. We're not the very young or the aged. We're the average
American family.''
   The Alexanders earn about $50,000 a year and have difficulty
making ends meet for themselves and their three children, she said.
She is an administrator at a mental retardation treatment facility.
Her husband Joe is a telephone installer.
   Ms. Alexander, 39, said she was inspired last year after hearing
Ms. Richards speak at a meeting of mental retardation professionals.
   ``It was like sitting ay my coffee table talking with somebody
over a cup of coffee, like she was speaking right to me. She was so
dynamic, yet so warm. I knew right then I had found a new hero,''
Ms. Alexander said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
   She gave Ms. Richards permission to quote from the letter, but
only if her name would not be used.
   ``When the word Lorena came on, everybody was surprised ... My
knees were weak. Here was my hero talking straight at me,'' she
said.
   ``It's been a long time since I had a hero,'' she added, calling
John and Robert Kennedy her last heroes.
   ``I was shocked that she used so much of the letter,'' Ms.
Alexander said. ``I hope it makes people aware of what's happening
in middle-class America.''
   Among the things happening to middle-class America is that
families are too busy to play active roles in politics, she said.
This year, for the first time since she has been eligible, Ms.
Alexander did not vote in the Texas presidential primary.
   ``The day just went by and I didn't get it done,'' she said
apologetically.

   In the pageantry of the roll call of states, it
almost seemed that delegates to the Democratic National Convention
had a decision to make. They didn't, but that's show business.
   And show business is what national political conventions have
become. They are unrivaled as the greatest shows in American
politics. Their central decisions are made in advance, far from the
convention hall, by voters, not delegates.
   Nowadays, conventions are scripted and scheduled to the minute.
While the schedules seldom work, the schedulers try to enforce
them, the better to play to national television. Convention roles,
from keynote speaker to alternate delegate, reward and recognize
party leaders and workers.
   They bring together the disparate, sometimes conflicting
elements which in coalition, make up the Democratic and Republican
parties. Only then do northeastern liberals sit in side-by-side
unity, if not always in full accord, with Sun Belt conservatives.
   So Jesse Jackson makes his peace with the ticket he wanted to
lead, then join, and while some of his delegates grumble, they
nonetheless agree that Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
are more to their taste than Vice President George Bush and the
running mate he has yet to name.
   For a week or so, every fourth year, there really is a national
Democratic Party and a Republican Party people can see and
identify. That's important in a process built around a two-party
system that exists because it evolved, not because it was written
down anywhere.
   Modern conventions don't call the tunes, they dance to the music.
   In Atlanta, delegates caucused and convention whips counted
heads, all as though there were something still to be settled.
There wasn't, but the exercise proceeded as it always does.
   Dukakis sealed his Democratic presidential nomination on June 7,
capturing a delegate majority six weeks before the convention. The
nomination was a ritual. Dukakis got 2,876.25 votes, Jackson
1,218.5. Then, on a motion from the Jackson side, the convention
made it unanimous.
   Republicans will conduct a similar rite on Aug. 17 in New
Orleans, formally awarding the nomination Vice President George
Bush captured for certain on April 26. Bush is unopposed.
   Not since 1952 has a national convention taken more than one
ballot to name its nominee. Adlai E. Stevenson won the Democratic
nomination on a third ballot that year, defeating then-Sen. Estes
Kefauver of Kentucky, who had won the presidential primaries but
couldn't make it stick.
   Now primaries rule and conventions ratify.
   There was pre-season speculation that this time might be
different, that a divided Democratic field might deadlock the
primaries and therefore the convention, forcing multiple ballots
and opening the way for a late-blooming candidate. That never was a
realistic prospect. The primary election arithmetic precludes it.
   At the next Democratic convention there will be even less
delegate leeway. In a concession to Jackson, the Democrats agreed
to tie 1992 delegate votes even more tightly to the primary
election numbers.
   Four Republican conventions ago, when then-President Richard M.
Nixon was renominated in 1972, a minute-by-minute convention script
leaked out, to the consternation of the GOP leadership. It outlined
a clockwork convention, with ``spontaneous demonstrations''
included and timed to the minute. Republicans were embarrassed to
have their make-believe spontaneity unveiled.
   There's no embarrassment about such matters now. Convention
scripts are released in advance. They seldom make the timetable,
but they try. The nominating session ran about an hour behind
schedule.
   Presidential nominees used to stage-manage some suspense into
the proceedings by waiting until the final day before naming a
running mate. It wasn't publicly discussed in advance. Bad form.
   Not in Atlanta. Dukakis announced his choice of Bentsen for vice
president six days before the convention. The 1984 ticket also was
complete before the convention began.
   But the show goes on, a political extravaganza tailored for
television. Not even the delegates are essential. Some of them were
kept out along with late-arriving spectators and journalists when
the fire department decreed that the hall was overcrowded and
barred access during the Tuesday and Wednesday night sessions.
Anyone who wasn't in by mid-evening wasn't admitted.
   ``This is not a superdome,'' said Democratic Chairman Paul G.
Kirk Jr. ``For all intents and purposes, it's a live TV studio.''
   The Atlanta Omni normally seats 16,237, and that doesn't include
the floor where the delegates are sitting. For the convention,
capacity is 11,000. A grandiose, multi-tiered platform from which
convention business is conducted takes a big bite out of the
convention floor space. If the thing could fly, it would look like
a ``Star Wars'' space ship worthy of Darth Vadar.
   Between the monster platform and the proliferation of broadcast
booths and press stands, the Democrats are meeting in a shrunken
room.
   Kirk said the overcrowding that led to the closed convention
doors had nothing to do with the size of the hall. He said there
were too many people.
   ``If you like being crammed in like a sardine, it's a pretty
nice place to be,'' said Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle.
   Then again, if you don't like being crammed in like a sardine,
it is best to steer clear of national conventions.

   The semicircle of children eyed Kitty Dukakis
intently as she talked about peer pressure, about accepting an
amphetamine from a friend _ and about 26 years of addiction that
followed. ``The words I want to say to you are `don't start,''' she
said.
   She also spoke of the fear _ and eventual joy _ that came with
her successful effort to end her dependence on stimulants.
   ``I gave credit for everything good that happened to me to the
pills because I didn't think I could do anything without them,''
she said, describing the steps that led to her decision to seek
treatment in 1982.
   ``Life is so much sweeter now,'' a beaming Mrs. Dukakis told the
children as her husband Michael stood by her side.
   The children hearing the story were gathered Wednesday outside a
community center in Conyers, a predominantly black community near
Atlanta. They could have been anywhere in America.
   As Dukakis crisscrossed the country in his successful quest for
the Democratic presidential nomination, he made anti-drug efforts a
major issue and his wife his top spokeswoman for the cause.
   He talks of tough law enforcement but also compassionate drug
education; she speaks of dramatic mood swings and skipping from
doctor to doctor to gain a new prescription for the pills she took
each morning from age 19 to 45.
   ``I couldn't stop using them and I became dependent,'' she told
the children in Conyers.
   When asked how she kept getting new prescriptions, she said, ``I
think most physicians and people in the country didn't think they
were dangerous.''
   She then detailed how she hid her addiction from her husband,
who met his future wife seven years after she began taking
amphetamines to lose weight, and her decision to enter a Minnesota
treatment clinic in 1982 in the middle of her husband's successful
campaign to regain the governorship he had lost four years earlier.
   ``I was very scared,'' she said. ``I was afraid because for 26
years, every morning, I had taken a pill, a mind-altering pill.''
   At that time, Dukakis said his wife was receiving treatment for
hepatitis. When she disclosed her addiction at an emotional
announcement last year, Dukakis defended his decision to lie about
his wife's condition in 1982.
   Mrs. Dukakis, in a recent interview, said the decision was made
to keep her treatment private because ``at that time, I could not
handle the public scrutiny. I was embarrassed and vulnerable and
afraid.''
   But now, her victory over drug dependency has become a powerful
message of her husband's campaign.
   ``I feel strong and confident in myself and what I have done,''
she said. ``And secondly, and as important or more important, one
of the tenets of recovering is helping other people.''

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo says Michael Dukakis
will win the White House in November and serve for two terms,
putting to rest any thought of a Cuomo presidency.
   ``Governor Dukakis will be President Dukakis for eight years and
by then I will be, I hope, somewhere on a bench,'' Cuomo said at a
news conference outside The Omni just before Dukakis won the
nomination Wednesday night.
   ``I'll be too old eight years from now,'' said the 56-year-old
governor who once was the most talked about possible contender for
the 1988 nomination. ``I think I will be a footnote in history. I
hope an unambiguous footnote.''
   Before leaving the convention to fly home to Albany after
casting his delegate vote for Dukakis, Cuomo said he didn't feel
snubbed at not being asked to play a role at the convention by
Dukakis.
   And Cuomo, as convention delegates gave the nomination to
another Northeastern liberal governor who is the son of immigrants,
insisted he had ``no regrets at all'' about not running himself.
   The governor refused to discuss the possibility of Dukakis
losing in November.
   ``He's not going to lose,'' Cuomo said.
   When it came to this year's convention, Cuomo called Dukakis'
decision not to invite him to speak a ``perfectly appropriate
judgment and I told him that.''
   Cuomo, who electrified the 1984 convention with his keynote
address, met privately Tuesday with Dukakis. On Monday, both
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson had told Cuomo they didn't have the time
to meet with him.
   ``I was sitting there with him. He offered me cheese. He offered
me fruit. I said hello to his mother. I didn't feel snubbed,'' said
Cuomo. ``I spoke to them (the convention delegates) in 1984. Have
you forgotten already?''
   Asked if Dukakis had requested Cuomo's presence on the podium on
Thursday night at the end of the convention, a traditional honor
accorded prominent party members, Cuomo said he hadn't been asked.
   ``It's unimportant who's on the podium or unimportant whether
I'm on the podium,'' he said.
   Cuomo didn't endorse Dukakis until after all the primaries had
ended and Dukakis had the nomination locked up. The New York
governor also refused to rule out accepting a convention draft for
the nomination until well into the primary season.
   Despite that, Cuomo and Dukakis have said their relationship is
good.
   Cuomo said he would do whatever he could for Dukakis in New York
and elsewhere, ``consistent with what I do as governor and we're
very busy, as everybody knows.''

   The keynote speaker and dozens of other
dignitaries were locked out of the Democratic National Convention
because of overcrowding in The Omni arena, forcing them to miss the
climax of their confabulation.
   Delegates, party leaders, convention staffers and reporters
milled about in frustration outside the blockaded walkway to the
hall Wednesday as the delegates inside nominated Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis for president.
   It was the second time in as many nights that the hall was
closed by fire marshals. Some of those locked out angrily denounced
the Democratic National Committee for choosing the relatively small
arena for the convention of more than 4,000 delegates.
   ``I want to go vote. I want to hear the nominations. I don't
understand this,'' said Blanche Preston McSmith, a delegate who
traveled from Auke Bay, Alaska, to cast her vote for Jesse Jackson.
``They won't let me in.''
   ``Who's sitting in my seat? I want him out,'' thundered Michael
Stein, a delegate from Chicago. ``I am being prevented from
representing the people who elected me. This is an injustice. ....
It's outrageous.''
   Others, including the party leaders caught outside the hall,
accepted their fortune mildly. ``There was no hassle at all,'' said
Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, the keynote speaker Monday night. ``I
came late and the hall was full.''
   She went back to her hotel room and watched the roll call on
television.
   Rep. Robert Garcia of New York barely made it into the hall, and
said he had left behind colleagues including Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston of Louisiana and Reps. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, Jim
Slattery of Kansas and Brian Donnelly of Massachusetts.
   Seen standing outside were Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, Reps.
Peter Rodino of New Jersey and Les Aspin and Gerald Kleczka of
Wisconsin, former Wisconsin Gov. Patrick Lucey and Bert Lance, a
Jackson adviser and former director of the Office of Management and
Budget for President Carter.
   ``If Pete Rodino and Les Aspin are on the outside, I'm with
them,'' Lance said. Rodino managed to gain entry later. Aspin did
not, despite his delegation's appeal from the convention floor for
him to be admitted.
   Critics of The Omni's selection had warned that it would be too
small to accommodate convention crowds. Fire Chief William H. Hamer
said he would allow about 12,500 people inside _ there were 11,000
seats _ and the DNC stationed workers at each door to count those
entering and leaving.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young earlier blamed the crowding on
reporters in the hall. But Joel Justice, a delegate from Atlanta,
said convention planning was at fault.
   ``We thought we had all this problem worked out beforehand,'' he
said. ``Evidently it didn't work out exactly like they planned.''

   A group of Pennsylvanians was so eager to hear
Gov. Robert P. Casey address the Democratic National Convention
that they used fake credentials to enter The Omni, said
Pennsylvania state chairman Larry Yatch.
   ``It was just people who were a little overzealous,'' Yatch said
Wednesday after six members of the group were forced to leave the
convention hall.
   After the discovery, security was tightened at entrances to The
Omni, and credentials were scanned by special laser devices to

   An editorial cartoon depicting Jesse Jackson as a

``reasonable comment,'' a member of the newspaper staff says.
   Larry Ferguson, a Phoenix (Ariz.) Gazette editorial writer who
approved the cartoon, defended it Wednesday as ``reasonable comment
for a cartoonist'' and said no apology was warranted.
   Sixty members of the Arizona delegation to the Democratic
National Convention signed a letter to the editor saying the
cartoon portrayed Arizona as a ``haven for racism.''
   Cartoonist Len Borozinski sees Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis ``as having slighted Jesse,'' Ferguson said. The cartoon

<TEXT>
   If the Democratic National Convention seems more
like a Hollywood production than a political event, Hollywood
producer Gary Smith has done his job.
   Shouting staccato bursts of instructions into a telephone
headset, Smith is orchestrating every minute of the action from a
control center its occupants call Tech Tower _ the top tier of the
imposing camera stand opposite the podium.
   ``Kenneth Mack is coming in! Lower the lights! Hold it! Hold it!
Lower the podium! And _ music!''
   With the singing of the national anthem safely under way, the
producer could lean back and relax _ for three minutes.
   Smith, a trim man with a mustache, glasses and a yellow tie,
sits before five television monitors, surrounded by notebooks,
telephones and a timer that he clutches anxiously when politicians
go into overtime at the rostrum.
   His crisp directions are heard over an open line by the
orchestra conductor, the podium stage manager, the TelePrompTer
operator and his partner, Dwight Hemion, director of television
coverage for the party's satellite service to stations across the
nation.
   As the convention opened Wednesday at 6 p.m., Smith was in his
element, directing preparations for a Boy Scout color guard,
gesticulating at his operatives on the podium, scribbling notes on
his schedule, requesting frequent changes of lighting from Don Tyra
sitting beside him at a console.
   By 8:30 p.m., the program was nearly an hour behind. Bye-bye to
introductions of the youngest delegate and former House Speaker
Carl Albert, so long for the second time to a videotaped tribute to
party secretary Dorothy Bush.
   Smith was not worried; there was a 46-minute recess built into
the session. But when it came, officials apparently had not decided
whether to cancel it or not. There were long seconds of emptiness
at the podium.
   ``Some music!'' Smith yelled into his headset. ``Some music!''
The orchestra obliged and the officials shortly decided to go on
with the show.
   It wasn't the only time Smith had to do some quick thinking.
When a delegate scheduled to introduce three governors began
speaking into a dead microphone from her place in the Indiana
delegation, Smith quickly turned on a mike in front of him.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he announced in a deep voice. ``The
governor of Colorado, Roy Romer.''
   Often by gestures alone, Smith issued lighting instructions to
go black or brighten up, suddenly or slowly. And by the subtle
movement of Tyra's finger on a control, the hall would fall silent,
all eyes on the podium; a demonstration would explode or wane, on
cue with bright or fading lights.
   Nearly five hours before the California delegation clinched the
nomination for the Massachusetts governor, Smith was explaining to
Tyra how to dramatize the moment. ``You'll feel it in the hall,''
he said. ``We'll bring the lights down. They'll say California, and
we'll bring the lights up.''
   Tension mounted as the moment approached. ``Sneak 'em down,
sneak 'em down,'' Smith told Tyra. ``Stand by, ready to bring 'em
up, ready music, NOT NOW _ NOT NOW'' as the California delegation
started cheering its own lieutenant governor.
   Then the announcement, California gives 235 votes to Dukakis.
``Go! Music!'' Smith yelled. Tyra zipped up the lights. The
orchestra began a medley of ``It's a Grand Old Flag'' and ``The
Washington Post March.'' Placards waved, delegates cheered, Smith
actually stood up and clapped his hands twice.
   ``They said it looks great,'' he exulted, listening to a
convention official on his headset. ``I think it's great. But it's
nice to hear it from them. ... Turn the lights down a little bit.
Keep the spotlights going.''
   The demonstration continued enthusiastically until Smith
realized the television networks were switching back to local
programming. ``Is NBC gone?'' he yelled frantically. ``Is NBC gone?
Yes?'' And into the headphone, ``OK! CUT IT!'' The music stopped
instantly and the demonstration petered out.
   Dick Ortner of ABC, the host network, said profits dictate the
network decisions to cut away from convention coverage. ``If a
demonstration goes too far,'' he explained, ``they see money going
down the tube.''

   Notable quotes from the Democratic National
Convention:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, after the Massachusetts governor clinched the
Democratic presidential nomination: ``It's all a little bit like a
play.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, after saying he would urge that the Dukakis
nomination be made unanimous: ``This is the appropriate time for
the transition of leadership for the fall campaign to take place.''
   
   BILL CLINTON, governor of Arkansas, giving the nominating speech
for Dukakis: ``As governor, Michael Dukakis hasn't just played with
issues the way some politicians do, he's wrestled them to the
ground. He's made the hard decisions: to balance budgets, to create
jobs, to fight crime and drug abuse, to increase day care and
health care, to do all those things that a leader has to do.''
   
   WILLIAM WINPISINGER, president of the International Association
of Machinists, nominating Jesse Jackson for president: ``He has
seized history by the mane and he is in the process of helping us _
leading us _ as we write a new chapter, not only in the annals of
American history, but in the chronicles of humankind's long and
torturous progress toward peace and prosperity for all in a global
community.''
   
   MAXINE WATERS, a California assemblywoman, delivering the second
nominating speech for Jackson: ``As his name goes into nomination,
so does yours. For this one man's message has transformed a nation.
We will never again be the same.''
   
   DUKAKIS, when a Boys Club official who introduced Dukakis to a
group of youngsters thanked the governor for taking time away from
his busy schedule: ``The problem with being a candidate is they
never let you out of the hotel room. So this is a joy to me.''
   
   REP. MORRIS K. UDALL, D-ARIZ., on the convention itself:
``Somebody said, `Everything has been said but that not everyone
had said it.'''

<TEXT>
   For Greek-Americans among the Democratic
delegates, the nomination of Michael Dukakis was a culmination of
their dreams in America as well as a tribute to their heritage in
Greece, the place where democracy was born.
   ``America is my country. But tonight, I'm Greek in my heart,''
said Nick Poulos, who immigrated from Athens in 1955, built his own
construction company in New Jersey and, in the last year, raised
more than $1 million for Dukakis' campaign.
   Like other delegates and supporters of Greek heritage on the
floor of The Omni _ some sporting T-shirts exclaiming ``Y'assou,''
or ``Right on!'' _ Poulos said his heritage gives him a special
bond with Dukakis.
   ``I worked hard to be a success and tonight I see again that
this country gives you the opportunity to be whatever you want to
be,'' said Poulos, who left the Republican Party for Dukakis.
   Agnes Anthonakes Ricko credits her parents' dinner-table
discussions of civil duty and social responsibility with her
interest in politics. It's a Greek trait, she said.
   ``Maybe it was because democracy was born in Greece,'' the
Massachusetts delegate said. ``He (Dukakis) reflects all of our
American values as well as our forefathers' values.''
   Dukakis' parents immigrated from Greece. His father Panos put
himself through college and medical school and became a successful
family doctor specializing in obstretics. His mother Euterpe worked
in the mills and became a schoolteacher.
   As a Massachusetts politician from the comfortable Boston suburb
of Brookline, Dukakis rarely mentioned his Greek heritage. He was a
candidate who spoke for middle-class suburbanites interested in
clean, efficient government, rather than a representative of
blue-collar immigrants.
   Then in a trip to Greece in 1976, he discovered his roots and
slowly he began mentioning his family's story _ the classic tale of
uneducated immigrants building successful lives in America.
   But in his presidential campaign, Dukakis found that the
American dream played well: he rarely failed to mention his
parents, especially when campaigning before others relatively new
to this country.
   When he talks of his roots in speeches, he tells of other
immigrant groups as well, of the American immigrant story. He
always says something in Spanish when before a Hispanic audience.
   But Greek-Americans say he's talking to them. And as one of
their own was nominated for president, they were overwhelmed.
   ``It's a feeling you can't explain,'' said Ohio state Dukakis
director Anne Drake, who was born Anastasia Drakopoulos. ``Probably
the only other people who can understand that feeling here tonight
are the black Baptists with Jesse Jackson. I understand that
feeling they have. It's an awesome feeling.''
   Dukakis, she said, ``represents the American dream for us and
for every other immigrant group.''
   Terre Haute, Ind., Mayor Pete Chalos arrived in the United
States from Greece at age 14. He believes Dukakis' nomination
reaffirms the ideals that drew his father across the ocean.
   ``This is probably the only country where the son of an
immigrant can become president,'' Chalos said. ``This tells people
that even if your dad came from a foreign country and didn't speak
English that well, that's not a handicap. You can still accomplish
something.''
   Leo Condos said as a child he remembered his father wishing
there would be a Greek president someday.
   ``Tonight I get to vote that dream in for him,'' Condos said.
``The Greek immigrant, like most immigrants, wants a better life
for his children, and then he wants to turn around and pay the
country back.
   ``Michael Dukakis fulfills that dream for a lot of immigrants,''
Condos said. ``Y'assou!''

   The boring-convention prophecy finally came to
pass on the third day of the Democratic National Convention,
leaving the television networks time to fill in the middle of prime
time.
   After Jesse Jackson's riveting speech on Tuesday night,
Wednesday night's speech by Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton nominating
Gov. Michael Dukakis was like switching from ``The Cosby Show'' to
``My Mother the Car.''
   But the networks ran over prime time again to capture the
watching-the-grass-grow excitement of the nominating vote.
California put Dukakis over the top at about 11:15 p.m. EDT. ABC
beat a retreat shortly after 11:30. NBC and CBS stayed for the
anticlimax to the anticlimax when Jackson's campaign manager,
Willie Brown, ascended the podium to move for nomination by
acclamation. NBC signed off at 11:45. CBS at 11:55.
   Clinton's speech surely gave the network control rooms a
workout, trying to find spots to fill in. ABC cut from the droning
to an interesting background piece on Dukakis by Jeff Greenfield.
   Otherwise, the networks filled in with commentary and by going
frequently to the floor reporters for how-boring-is-he? reports.
   ``Bill Clinton is continuing his speech despite the best efforts
of people up here on the podium to get him to stop,'' reported
NBC's Connie Chung.
   ``You've got to admit as an actress, he lost the crowd,'' NBC's
Chris Wallace told rather than asked Olympia Dukakis, the
candidate's cousin.
   By contrast with Clinton, it was high entertainment to watch
ABC's Peter Jennings request comment from co-anchor David Brinkley,
whose clip-on microphone had fallen off. ``Here, use mine,''
Jennings offered, before noticing that his mike cord was about 18
inches long.
   ``I've always wanted to get close to you,'' he said as the two
leaned together so Brinkley could talk into the mike.
   At about 10:20, the balloting finally began. Gone are the days
when viewers kept their own tallies, anxiously wondering which
state would be the one to put the favorite over the top. The
Democrats struggled to get through the roll call before prime time
ended at 11, but Dukakis didn't get the nomination until 11:15.
   When Americans Abroad cast fractional votes, all three network
computers disgorged a different opinion of the figure after the
decimal point. NBC's added 0.9, ABC's voted for 0.7, CBS 0.8. Cable
apparently didn't suffer math anxiety and came up with 0.25 for the
final fraction.

   The number of television viewers increased during Jesse
Jackson's speech on national television Tuesday night.
   According to figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co., NBC's rating
rose from an 8.7 for the 10:30-11 p.m. EDT period to a 10.4 after
11 p.m. Jackson began speaking just before 11. ABC's went up from a
7.8 to a 9.3, and CBS' went from 6.9 to 8.7.
   NBC won the night with an 8.8 rating and 17 share. ABC had a 7.8
and 15 and CB 6.7 and 13. CNN had a rating of 2.3. It's rating rose
to 2.8 during Jackson's speech.
   The rating is a percentage of 88.6 million total homes with
televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. CNN figures
are based on the markets where it is available, about half as many
as the networks.

   Comedians are a hot TV commodity at the Democratic National
Convention.
   Al Franken, a writer and performer on NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live,'' is a commentator for CNN.
   ``It's great to be here for CNN, which is the only network
providing gavel-to-gavel coverage,'' he said. ``For CNN's sake, I
hope it's an exciting convention. Otherwise, I think Ted Turner
should just colorize the 1960 Democratic convention and show that.''
   The Fox Broadcasting Co.'s syndicated newsmagazine show ``A
Current Affair'' is originating from Atlanta and employing not one
but two comedians, impressionist Jim Morris, who has been running
around playing George Bush, and political humorist Will Durst as
commentator on the media.
   Durst said the convention was being covered by ``anybody who can
make a satellite uplink out of a Hoola Hoop and some tinfoil.''

   Van Endref's thirsty Southern Illinois fields soaked up a heavy
rain that he and other farmers call a ``godsend,'' but experts say
recent showers in the Midwestern farm belt don't bode an end to the
drought.
   ``The corn crop overall has been hurt quite considerably because
the needed rains came about two to three weeks too late,'' said
John Unger, a crop statistician for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in Illinois.
   And the rain may be only a respite. In its 30-day outlook, the
National Weather Service predicts more hot, dry weather _
above-normal temperatures and below-normal rainfall for the
nation's heartland.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng inspected a cornfield in
central Minnesota on Wednesday, saying the damage is the worst he's
seen in eight drought-ravaged states over the past two days.
   ``We've educated ourselves a great deal,'' Lyng told Edgar Traut
and his wife Kathleen, who own a 320-acre dairy farm near St.
Cloud, Minn.
   But the recent rainfall _ average 1 to 2 inches across the
Midwest _ gave farmers like Van Endref something to be happy about.
His 2,000 acres near Elkville, Ill., got nearly 4 inches of rain
since Sunday.
   Endref says he expects a 50 percent corn crop and a 75 percent
soybean crop _ enough at least to cover his production costs.
   ``It doesn't look as bleak as it did just 10 days ago when it
looked like we wouldn't raise a thing,'' he said Wednesday night.
``In our immediate area, it's made a big turnaround.''
   Herman Krone's 2,800-acre farm in Du Quoin, Ill., which
President Reagan visited last week, was drenched by more than 3
inches of rain in 24 hours.
   ``It's a godsend,'' Krone said.
   In central Arkansas' Pulaski County, Greg Chapman beamed as his
drought-shriveled soybean field got a dose of rain.
   ``I'm smiling,'' Chapman said as he watched the downpour from a
farm shop in Scott. ``Three weeks ago, I thought it wouldn't rain
again for the rest of the year.''
   But other farmers were left high and dry.
   ``I can't even remember the last rain,'' said a discouraged
Sonny Wiederkehr, a Texas rancher with 3,000 acres who said his
parched pastures ``look like the pavement.''
   Despite the rains, restrictions on lawn sprinkling remained in
effect in many cities, including at least five Chicago suburbs.
   In Kentucky, this week's rainfall has helped recharge ponds,
streams and rivers, said Mike Callahan, a weather service
hydrologist in Louisville.
   ``The Ohio River is actually starting to come up now,'' he said.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
higher-than-normal rain is expected over the next five days for the
Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the region comprising Tennessee,
Kentucky, West Virginia and southern Ohio.
   But the weather is expected to continue to be drier-than normal
in the area from Michigan and Wisconsin, stretching southwest
across the cornbelt states to Kansas, Oklahoma and north Texas.
   Mississippi officials predict a $600 million loss in state
agriculture. Although the rain has improved grazing conditions for
cattle, subsoil moisture still has not returned.
   ``In general, it's improving but if the rain stops we'll be in
the same situation,'' said Linda Moore, of the Mississippi
Cooperative Extension Service.
   Recent rainfall ``doesn't mean the drought's over with, of
course, because we've got a big rain deficit,'' added meteorologist
John Wright of the weather service's Midwest Agricultural Weather
Service Center at Purdue University in Indiana.
   Lyng told the Minnesota gathering he plans to brief President
Reagan next week about his drought visit.

<HEAD>FCC Moves Toward Phone-Company Cable TV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is a
step closer to allowing telephone companies to provide cable
television services.
   In a series of actions Wednesday, the FCC indicated it favors
lifting an agency regulation and a separate law that bar telephone
companies from running cable companies in their own service areas.
   The FCC voted tentatively to recommend to Congress that it
repeal the 1984 prohibition and directed its staff to begin the
process of repealing its own rule against such activity.
   The commission called the prohibitions a draconian form of
regulation no longer needed because the cable industry has become
large and strong enough to compete with the telephone companies.
   The FCC said allowing telephone companies to operate cable
systems will increase services for customers, including home
shopping and video phones, as well as providing an additional
source of pay television programming.

   President Reagan is congratulating
congressional lawmakers for handing him an $18 billion spending
bill for water and energy earlier than any appropriations bill in
his presidency.
   Reagan signed the bill while on vacation in California on
Wednesday and also commended Congress for holding spending to
levels acceptable to his administration.
   The bill was the first regular spending measure to get Reagan's
signature since December 1985.
   In recent years, spending battles between the administration and
Congress have spawned huge catchall spending measures enacted at
the end of the fiscal year.
   In his statement on signing the bills, Reagan urged Congress to

   Mississippi is the state that is ``moving beyond
the politics of race,'' Jesse Jackson is ``the man who excited our
hearts,'' and in every one of the nation's 50 states and far-flung
outposts, Michael Dukakis is ``the next president of the United
States.''
   Hyperbole? Not at a political convention, a free prime-time
forum. A convention roll call is an invitation to advertise.
   ``The Empire State, proud and unified in support of what will be
the greatest election this country ever had, proudly casts ... ''
was New York's report. No state ever humbly casts.
   Before the convention, Dorothy Bush, the 71-year-old secretary
of the Democratic Party, had said she wanted the delegates to know
she was glad they came and that ``the personal touch is important.''
   In this, her 12th consecutive convention roll call, Mrs. Bush
gave it the personal touch.
   In calling for Mississippi's vote, she noted that it ``happens
to be the state where I was born.'' In response, the chairman of
the delegation noted that the state was moving beyond the politics
of race and ``making sure Mississippi will never be last again.''
   Jackson may have lost the nomination, but he was praised
effusively.
   Montana said he ``made Americans stand a little taller,'' New
Jersey found him to be ``a man who excited our hearts and a man we
have come to love,'' and Ohio saw him as ``that extraordinary voice
for the future.''
   Dukakis did not get such lavish tributes, but he got the votes.
   The states' self-praise knew no bounds. Arizona not only was the
home of the Grand Canyon but was ``the ideal site for the
superconducting super collider.'' Historic Delaware started the
nation, the District of Columbia is ``soon to be the state of
Columbia'' and Florida is ``the state of choice for 1,000 residents
each day.''
   Minnesota was home to world-class champions Hubert Humphrey and
Walter Mondale, both losers as presidential candidates, and to the
Twins, winners of the 1987 World Series.
   Nebraska is the good-life state, New Mexico is enchanted by its
many cultures and Oklahoma is committed to excellence.
   Oregon ``made the U.S.A. from sea to shining sea'' while
Pennsylvania's working people outproduce the world.
   Vermont voted only once in its history for a Democratic
candidate for president _ in 1964 _ but this is the year it's going
to do it again. Washington's ``union-made planes carried you to
Atlanta.''
   Wisconsin cast its votes and declared that ``if anyone has seen
Congressman Les Aspin, they wouldn't let him into the hall this
evening.'' If the doors hadn't been closed because of overcrowding,
the sad tale went, ``we would have cast one more vote for Mike
Dukakis.''
   It was Texas that delivered a line Democrats can sink their
teeth into. Texas, said the chairman, is ``home to 16 million
hard-working Texans and one tourist from Kennebunkport, Maine.''
   George Bush will have a chance to rebut the charge next month,
when Republicans unveil their own messages of hype and hope.

   After sitting patiently on their placards while
Jesse Jackson's supporters enjoyed the spotlight the night before,
Michael Dukakis' faithful were unleashed to shout and dance in the
aisles when their turn came. Then they took their carnival outside
to the streets.
   The floor of The Omni was a mass of ``Duke, Duke, Duke'' signs
Wednesday night as the California delegation put Dukakis over the
top and gave him the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Some floor leaders hugged as delegates threw red, silver and
blue streamers and batted giant beach balls about.
   Delegates linked arms and swayed in unison as singer Dionne
Warwick performed, then moved outside for a fireworks show, a
marching band and echoing chants for Dukakis.
   In the Georgia delegation, Sen. Sam Nunn clapped to the rhythm
and former President Carter flashed his toothy smile.
   ``I'm very pleased we nominated a man who's going to win and be
a great administrator,'' Carter said.
   Over at in New York delegation, Gov. Mario Cuomo said he, too,
couldn't be happier.
   ``This is a winning combination if I ever saw one,'' Cuomo said.
   For Jackson delegates, the night held mixed feelings _ delight
in seeing their candidate nominated, disappointment at the expected
loss.
   ``They are using Jesse Jackson's message without the man,'' said
a still angry Mark Allen from Chicago, who paraded through the
Dukakis forces with a Jackson sign.
   ``Jesse Jackson will still be the conscience of the Democratic
Party,'' he said.
   The rowdy Dukakis fans chanted ``We Want The Duke,'' and ``We
Want Mike'' after the nomination, but they didn't get him just yet.
Dukakis will formally accept the nomination in a speech tonight.
   His forces did get a move for a unanimous vote from Jackson's
side, and there were only a handful of ``No's'' when the unanimous
vote was taken.
   Cuomo said he was eager to campaign for the nominee.
   ``I'll go to California. I'll go to Michigan. I'll go
whereever,'' Cuomo said. ``I'll go for sandwiches if he wants.''

<HEAD>Sources Say Deputies Not Given Go-Ahead To Fire On Gunman</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ Deputies were denied permission when
they asked to fire on a gunman who killed four people in their
cars, according to people who were listening to Forsyth County
Sheriff's department radio reports.
   Authorities on Wednesday served Michael Charles Hayes, 24, with
four murder warrants in the neighborhood shootings Sunday night
that also left five people wounded. The gunman also fired on
deputies, but they were uninjured.
   Hayes, who was bound to his hospital bed by leather straps
holding his arms and legs, is being treated for wounds suffered
when deputies finally shot him near the moped shop he operated.
Hayes' family had sought to have him committed to a mental hospital
the day before the shootings.
   Steve McGuire of Winston-Salem said he was tuned in to radio
conversations between deputies and the sheriff's dispatcher during
the 12-minute rampage Sunday night.
   ```A civilian has been shot,''' McGuire recalled hearing. ```Do
I have permission to take him down?'''
   Maguire said a supervisor replied, ``No, wait until I get
there.''
   A man named Robert, who declined to give his full name, gave the
Winston-Salem Journal this account of the radio traffic during the
shootings:
   Deputy: ``I'm 50 to 60 yards in front of moped shop, and he's
shooting at the car.''
   Dispatcher: ``What?''
   Deputy: ``He shot a civilian in the car.''
   When the deputy requested permission to fire on Hayes, it was
denied, Robert told the newspaper.
   The car belonged to the third victim, Melinda Hayes, 21, no
relation to Hayes.
   By then Crystal Suzanne Cantrell, 16, and Thomas Walter
Nicholson, 24, had been killed. Within minutes, Ronald Lee Hull,
32, would be fatally wounded.
   Another source, who also listened to the transmissions and
insisted on anonymity, corroborated the two accounts.
   County Sheriff E. Preston Oldham declined to comment on his
department's investigation into Sunday night's events.
   ``It is still under investigation,'' Oldham said. ``I have
nothing else to say.''
   Earlier, Oldham said the investigation is expected to be
completed next week and that a news conference will be scheduled
then.

<HEAD>Former Presidential Candidate Released, Calls For Talks With
Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former presidential candidate was set
free by leftist guerrilla kidnappers and called on the government
to hold peace talks with the rebels, who had demanded talks as a
condition for his release.
   The government, which made no promises after newspaper editor
Alvaro Gomez Hurtado was abducted May 29, indicated after his
release Wednesday night that it might talk to the guerrillas.
   Church bells rang and drivers honked horns around this capital
city of 6 million after the release of the 69-year-old Gomez
Hurtado, who had been abducted in a hail of submachine gunfire that
killed one of his bodyguards.
   Gomez Hurtado, the Conservative party candidate who lost the
1986 presidential race to President Virgilio Barco Vargas, is the
some of former President Laureano Gomez Hurtado.
   In a telephone interview, he said he was released on the
outskirts of Bogota, where he caught a taxi to his home.
   About 5,000 people joyfully screaming ``Alvaro, Alvaro, Alvaro''
gathered in a park in front of his apartment building within an
hour.
   Gomez Hurtado, flanked by his wife and other family members,
smiled as he waved to the crowd from the window of his apartment.
   Leftist guerrillas, right-wing death squads and powerful drug
traffickers are active in Colombia and have kidnapped and killed
public officials in the last five years.
   As the editor of the Bogota daily El Siglo, Gomez Hurtado's
columns favored a military solution to the guerrilla problem. But
in the interview, he seemed to have changed his position.
   ``The episode of my kidnapping has been a confirmation that we
are living in difficult times and that it is necessary to look for
national reconciliation,'' he said, referring to the possibility of
peace negotiations.
   The April 19 Movement, one of five guerrilla groups in Colombia,
had said it kidnapped Gomez Hurtado and was demanding peace talks.
   Barco's government refused to make any promises to the rebel
band, known as M-19. But the rebels agreed last week to release
Gomez Hurtado anyway, perhaps because the kidnapping outraged
Colombians more than any previous guerrilla undertaking.
   Shortly after Gomez Hurtado was released, Barco put out a
cautious feeler that seemed to indicate a willingness to begin
peace talks with the rebels.
   ``The government will persist in its earnest desire for peace
and will do its utmost in searching for reconciliation between
Colombians,'' he said in a statement read for him over nationwide
television and radio.
   Early in the abduction, Gomez Hurtado was reported fatally
wounded. But he said Wednesday that he was not wounded and that the
only physical problem he had during his captivity was a stomach
ailment.
   ``I was treated well, and when I needed any medicine, it was
given to me without delay,'' he said.
   In a communique released on week ago in Panama City, the M-19
said it would release Gomez Hurtado. The communique, read by Papal
Nuncio Jose Sebastian Laboa, came after five hours of negotiations
in the Vatican Embassy in the Panamanian capital.
   It said the decision had been made ``in the spirit of finding
routes that lead to a more equitable society, to the preservation
of human rights and reconciliation among Colombians.''
   Peace talks with the estimated 10,000 to 20,000 leftist
guerrillas is a volatile issue in Colombia.
   Army generals, business leaders and congressmen say the
guerrillas tricked President Belisario Betancur with their demands
for peace talks in 1982. The opponents say the guerrillas used the
negotiations to recuperate from severe setbacks against government
security forces.
   Betancur's government negotiated a cease-fire with four of the
five leftist guerrilla groups, including the M-19, but the truce
collapsed within a year.
   Barco's government has kept up contacts with one of the
guerrilla groups, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces.
   Those talks have gone nowhere. Fighting between the group and
government security forces has been fierce since Barco took office
on Aug. 7, 1986.

   Former headmistress Jean Harris says she
wants her freedom after having served more than seven years of her
15-year-to-life prison term for the murder of Scarsdale Diet
developer Dr. Herman Tarnower.
   Mrs. Harris' supporters are seeking to gather signatures on
petitions to send to Gov. Mario Cuomo to reinforce her personal
letter requesting executive clemency.
   As of Aug. 23, Mrs. Harris will have served 7{ years at the
Bedford Hills Correctional Facility. State law requires that half
the minimum sentence be served before clemency can be considered.
She will be eligible for parole in 1996, when she serves the
minimum 15 years.
   ``She has paid her debt to society,'' Anne Lennox, a founder of
the Jean L. Harris Defense Fund in Monroe, N.H., said Wednesday.
``She has had two heart attacks, she suffers from angina and she
really is no threat to anyone.''
   Ms. Lennox started the petition drive, sending copies of the
petition to the 3,000 or so people nationwide who have expressed
interest in Mrs. Harris' case.
   Mrs. Harris, 65, was convicted in 1981 of shooting Tarnower at
his Purchase home in 1980 after Tarnower threw her over for a
younger woman.
   Mrs. Harris, who was headmistress of the exclusive Madeira
School for girls school in McLean, Va., always maintained she meant
to kill herself when she accidentally shot Tarnower four times.
   She first sought clemency two years ago after suffering two
heart attacks.
   But the governor's three-person clemency committee turned her
down, pointing out the time-served provision and declining to grant
her a waiver of that requirement.
   Now that the requirement has almost been met, supporters are
more optimistic.
   Mrs. Harris' attorney, Michael Kennedy, said he was preparing a
brief detailing why Cuomo should free Mrs. Harris and all the
documents, Mrs. Harris' letter and the petitions, would be sent to
Albany in late August or early September.
   Anne Crowley, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Mrs. Harris'
request would receive the same scrutiny as any other case.
   ``Each case is individual and that's how they're reviewed,'' she
said.
   Any clemency granted by Cuomo must be approved by the state
parole board.
   Since her incarceration, Mrs. Harris has written two books, one
an autobiography, ``Stranger in Two Worlds,'' and another due for
release next month, ``They Always Call Us Ladies,'' about prison
life and the need for prison reform.

<HEAD>Roy Disney Firm Makes $2.84 Billion Bid for Instant-Film Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. hinted it would reject a
proposed friendly takeover by the nephew of the late Walt Disney,
who announced a bid that values the instant-film company at $2.84
billion.
   Roy E. Disney, an investor with an estimated personal wealth of
$560 million, announced the offer Wednesday, and disclosed that he
already owns 6.9 percent of Polaroid through his family's Shamrock
Holdings Inc.
   Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., responded it was reviewing
the $40-a-share cash offer with the help of outside advisers, but
suggested management would look unfavorably on a buyout.
   Referring to a retrenchment plan involving layoffs and
cost-cutting that was announced last week, Polaroid said in a news
release: ``We firmly believe that this is, without doubt, the right
course for Polaroid and for all of its shareholders, employees,
customers and communities.''
   Polaroid's stock shot up $6 a share to $40 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
   Polaroid's retrenchment plan, announced July 12, was widely seen
as an anti-takeover measure, and analysts said the timing of the
Shamrock offer suggested it was the trigger for the Polaroid
changes.
   ``It would be very hard to say they're unassociated,'' William
Relyea, who follows Polaroid for Eberstadt Fleming Inc. in New
York, said of the offer and the changes announced at Polaroid.
   Polaroid said it would cut up to 8 percent of its U.S. workforce
and save $50 million a year by reducing overhead and research and
development costs. The company also announced it would repurchase
$300 million of its own shares and create an employee stock
ownership program that owns 14 percent of the company's stock.
   Polaroid also said it would enter the $7 billion-a-year world
market for conventional film, challenging Eastman Kodak Co. and
Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   Disney described Polaroid's planned foray into the conventional
film business as a misguided attempt to regain momentum in the face
of a stagnating market for instant cameras and film.
   ``The announcement ... appears to be a pedestrian attempt to
give the company new direction,'' Disney lieutenant Stanley P.
Gold, Shamrock president and chief executive officer, said in a
news release. ``It betrays Polaroid's heritage of invention and
creativity in the development of new products and markets.''
   Gold also denounced Polaroid's stock repurchase and employee
stock ownership plans as a ``management entrenchment scheme.''
   In a letter delivered to I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid
president and chief executive officer, Shamrock proposed that
Polaroid management cooperate with the takeover offer.
   Polaroid has 71 million shares outstanding, including a recent
issue of 10 million shares that created the employee stock
ownership program. The $40-a-share offer thus places a value of
$2.84 billion on the company.
   Shamrock already holds 4.93 million shares, or 6.9 percent. To
buy the rest at $40 a share would cost Shamrock $2.64 billion.

<HEAD>Poland to Free 95 Conscientious Objectors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities will free 95 young
men convicted or awaiting trial on charges of avoiding the military
draft, the state-run news agency PAP said.
   Wednesday's announcement came two days before the anniversary of
the 1944 establishment of Poland's Soviet-supported government and
one week after Parliament enacted a law allowing conscientious
objections to military service.
   But the most prominent conscientious objector, Slawomir
Dutkiewicz, 24, a supporter of the outlawed peace group Freedom and
Peace, will not be freed.
   The dispatch said Dutkiewicz, who friends say has been on a
hunger strike since November and is being force-fed, refuses to
perform alternative non-military service required by the new law.
   PAP said those to be freed include eight people sentenced to
prison for refusing military service because of their personal
moral convictions and 86 who refused for religious reasons.
   The releases ``have been prompted above all by humanitarian
principles. This is one more proof of democratization of life in
this country, of respect shown for citizens' views and convictions,
of consistency in the pursuit of the policy of national
reconciliation,'' the agency said.
   In addition, a prosecutor will ask for acquittal of one
unidentified person who refused induction into the army for
``pseudo-pacifist motives,'' PAP said.
   The decision came on a motion of the chief military prosecutor
to the Council of State, chaired by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
   ``It's not a surprise,'' said Freedom and Peace founder Jacek
Czaputowicz, whose group has waged a three-year civil disobedience
battle for enactment of a conscientious objectors' law.
   ``It's very positive, except for Dutkiewicz. It means they
accepted our goals. They accepted alternative service as an
institution and now we see that they would like to release almost
everybody.''
   He said the group would continue to press for Dutkiewicz's
release.
   Under the new law, people can apply for alternative service
working in a state enterprise for moral or religious beliefs. A
draft board comprised of military and civilian members will judge
the applicants.
   If granted, alternative civilian service is to last one year
longer than regular military service. Under Poland's draft law,
every young man is required to serve two years in the army, or one
if he is a university graduate.
   Czaputowicz said hsi group has been successful because its goals
were ``very concrete. It was realistic as we see now.''
   Last month, the group achieved another chief goal _ changing
Poland's military oath to remove a reference to serving alongside
the Soviet Red Army.
   ``Now is a good time for such demands because of perestroika,''
said Czaputowicz, referring to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign for fundamental social and economic reforms that do not
challenge the leading role of the Communist Party.
   ``We can pressure the authorities,'' he said. ``And now is the
time ... because of Gorbachev's peace offensive. They (authorities)
don't want people in prison.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Tuesday that if draft
resisters were freed, time served in prison probably would be
applied against their alternative service obligations.
   July 22, the Communists' national day, was when martial law was
lifted in 1983. It has been associated with amnesties of various
kinds.

said Antonio Castro Vasquez, local commander of the Federal Highway
Police.
   Its driver was killed, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
   Red Cross spokesman Marcelio Mendoza said the injured were ``in
grave condition.'' He said the bodies of several of those killed
were seriously burned and none had been identified.
   It was not immediately known how many passengers were on the
bus, which was operated by the Palmar Line company.
   Notimex quoted Castro as saying the truck driver was speeding
and in the wrong lane when the crash occurred.
   Cordoba is about 60 miles west of the Atlantic coast port of
Veracruz.

<HEAD>Congressional Agency Says Tighter Screening of Pilots Needed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A congressional research agency, citing the
increasing rate of aviation accidents involving pilot error, says
the federal government should encourage airlines to tighten their
screening of people flying the nation's crowded airways.
   The General Accounting Office report released this week stopped
short of calling for new regulations, but says the Federal Aviation
Administration should encourage commercial air carriers to use the
government's computer files to verify records of pilot safety.
   The report by the GAO, a bipartisan research arm of Congress,
said airlines spurred by deregulation hired some 9,700 new pilots a
year over the last four years.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, meanwhile, cited pilot
error as a factor in 95 percent of all commuter plane accidents and
63 percent of major airline accidents in 1985.
   Between 1980 and 1984, by contrast, 57 percent of commuter
accidents and 42 percent of major airline accidents had pilot error
as a factor, GAO said.
   ``The high percentage of accidents and incidents in which pilot
error was a factor, and accidents involving pilots with a history
of safety transgressions, indicate that airlines should use
available resources to help assure that the pilots they hire fly as
safely as possible,'' the report said.
   The NTSB earlier this year pinned the blame on an Aug. 16 1987
crash of a Northwest Airlines flight at Detroit's airport on the
failure of the two pilots to follow required checklist procedures
for takeoff. The crash killed 156 people on board and a
four-year-old girl survived.
   The Air Line Pilots Association attacked the report when it was
released in May, saying the safety board didn't give enough weight
to mechanical failure of cockpit instruments.
   In its report, GAO said the federal requirement for security
checks involves only verifying pilots' employment history for the
prior five years.
   ``Airlines are responsible for developing their own hiring
criteria in line with corporate preferences,'' GAO said.
   It said 62 percent of the airlines surveyed did nothing to
verify pilots' certificates and 56 percent did not check with the
FAA to check on past safety violations fliers may have.
   The research agency said, for instance, that pilots of a
commuter plane that crashed in Durango, Colo., in January had
received warning letters from the FAA but the airline was not aware
of the citations.
   Airlines should be encouraged to use the FAA's own computerized
listings, including the Accident@Incident Data System and the
Enforcement Information System, to verify what the pilots provide
and to give a broader background of the pilots, GAO concluded.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Refuses to Indict Six Cops in Shooting of Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury declined to indict five police
officers for shooting an unarmed, drug-addicted woman to death
after a car chase, but a sixth was charged with initially trying to
cover up his role in the shooting.
   The panel cleared the five officers of any criminal wrongdoing
in the April 27 shooting of Lidia Ferraro, 32, of Fairview, N.J.,
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced Wednesday.
   The panel ruled that Mrs. Ferraro's death stemmed in part from
her own actions and from an incorrect police radio transmission.
   However, the jury indicted Sgt. John O'Connor, 30, on charges he
attempted to cover up his role in the incident by replacing three
spent cartridges after he fired at Mrs. Ferraro's car in violation
of police rules. Later he admitted he had shot at the car.
   The shots were mistakenly reported over the police radio as
shots fired by Mrs. Ferraro.
   O'Connor, who faces up to four years in prison if convicted on
the charge of tampering with physical evidence, pleaded innocent
and was released without bail at his arraignment in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan a few hours later.
   All six officers face possible departmental charges for firing
their weapons in violation of regulations. Those rules allow
officers to shoot only when a felony has been committed and police
are in a life-threatening situation. They do not allow an officer
to fire to stop a car.
   O'Connor has been suspended. Capt. Mark Frances of the Police
Department's Field Investigation Unit said the other officers are
on modified assignment.
   The 8{-minute drama began when Mrs. Ferraro, high on drugs, ran
a red light, Morgenthau said. Officers in a radio car tried to stop
her and the chase was on up and down streets of East Harlem.
   At one point, O'Connor stepped in front of Mrs. Ferraro's car
and tried to stop it. As the car swerved around O'Connor, he fired
three shots at the tires.
   Morgenthau said Mrs. Ferraro appeared not to hear officers as
they shouted over the police car's public address system for her to
stop.
   Assistant District Attorney Kristine Hamann said toxicology
reports showed she had ``therapeutic amounts'' of Valium and
methadone in her system and ``enough heroin and cocaine to cause an
overdose in some people.''
   Mrs. Ferraro's husband, Guy, said she was in a
drug-rehabilitation program.
   Because a radio transmission said ``10-13, shots fired,'' police
officers who joined the chase believed Mrs. Ferraro had fired the
shots. A ``10-13'' call means an officer needs help.
   When Mrs. Ferraro's car stopped, she leaned over toward the
floor, Morgenthau said. The cops, mistakenly believing she was
armed because of the radio warning and her movement inside the car,
shot her dead.
   Ms. Hamann said 16 shots were fired at Mrs. Ferraro during the
chase. Eleven bullets were fired after she stopped and she was hit
five times.
   A lawyer for the Ferraro family, John Sullivan, called the
shooting an outrage. The family has filed notice of a $25 million
wrongful death suit against New York City.

   Three unarmed men posing as guards for an
armored car company got away with more than $1 million in cash and
checks from a Pan Am airlines counter at John F. Kennedy
International Airport.
   The Pan Am employees didn't realize they'd been robbed until the
real guards showed up 15 minutes later, Port Authority police said.
   The men entered the Pan Am building at 1:35 p.m. Wednesday and
walked into the ground-floor cashier's office, said Allen Morrison,
a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
   They were wearing uniforms and presented what appeared to be
legitimate identification cards from the Vets International Armored
Transport in Brooklyn. They did not have guns, said another Port
Authority spokesman, Tom Middlemiss.
   The trio signed for a pickup and received two bags containing
$50,000 in cash and more than $950,000 in non-negotiable checks,
Morrison said. The men then fled the terminal.
   ``Fifteen minutes later the real guys showed up,'' Middlemiss
said, and police were called.
   Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman for Pan American World Airways,
declined to comment on the incident and referred all questions to
the Port Authority.
   The Port Authority police and the FBI are investigating.

<HEAD>Eastern, Machinists To Continue Talks Despite Layoff Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and its machinists union plan to
continue contract talks despite reports that the money-losing
carrier is preparing to lay off 4,000 workers and make deep service
cuts.
   The layoffs would affect mostly non-union reservations and
airport workers, The Miami Herald reported. Most of the cuts would
affect Eastern destinations in the West and diminish Kansas City,
Mo.'s status as a hub.
   The moves, which the newspaper said would cut the Miami-based
carrier's work force by 12.5 percent in up to 20 cities by this
fall, are expected to be announced Friday.
   ``They don't communicate with us, they never tell us, there's no
cooperation,'' said Charles Bryan, president of Machinists District
100 and head of Eastern's 12,000 mechanics and ground-services
workers. ``They have no credibility, absolutely none.''
   Bryan said seven months of federally arbitrated contract talks
would continue this week, but last month's fragile agreement with
management on safety matters could be jeopardized by the imminent
reductions.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern and its Houston-based Texas
Air Corp. parent and three union leaders, including Bryan, under
federal guidance signed a peace treaty aimed at resolving disputes
over safety matters.
   In Miami, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell called Tuesday's
published report ``speculation.''
   Eastern, which last November laid off 3,500 employees, mostly in
Miami and Atlanta, and closed a reservations center in Chicago,
also reportedly is considering closing one or more of its remaining
nine reservations centers.
   Managers who supervise the affected areas have been summoned to
Miami for briefings Friday when negotiators for Eastern and the
pilots union are also scheduled to meet.
   Shrinking since its acquisition by Texas Air in 1986, Eastern
has cut its work force over the past two years from 42,000 to
32,000. The carrier serves 130 U.S. and foreign cities, down from
145 two years ago.
   Lorenzo has said Eastern, which is losing $1 million a day, will
sell assets and shrink to cover losses. Management has blamed much
of the losses on high labor costs.

<HEAD>Plans Abandoned To Dump U.S. Garbage In Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears of health hazards have derailed plans to
dump 7.5 million tons of American garbage in northern England, the
domestic news agency Press Association reported.
   The Manchester Ship Canal Co. will not be allowed to import the
waste from New York, Boston and Philadelphia over five years and
dump it near Warrington, near the northern city of Chester, the
agency said Wednesday.
   Winston Churchill, grandson of the wartime leader and member of
Parliament representing the area, said Wednesday: ``It is
unacceptable that the northwest should be made the world's
dustbin.''
   His comments echoed earlier protests by members of the Cheshire
county council, who asked the government in June to stop the
importation on health grounds.
   ``We understand that the rubbish will contain untreated waste
from New York hospitals as well as animal fats and rotting
vegetation,'' Councilor Derek Bateman was quoted as telling the
Daily Telegraph newspaper. ``The rubbish will not be covered, so we
will have the prospect of it blowing all over Cheshire and exposing
people to potential health risk.''
   The garbage, which would have arrived in open-topped containers
in Liverpool, would have been dumped on 390 acres owned by the
company and leased by the council, the Telegraph reported.
   A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said Wednesday
that the council had ruled against allowing the company to dump the
waste at the site.
   The company has the right to appeal, the spokesman said.
   No waste can be imported into Britain without approval of the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment.

   About 300 demonstrators from Texas and
Louisiana civil rights groups plan to march next month to protest
the acquittal of three white lawmen in the beating death of a
jailed black man.
   The marchers from Hemphill, Houston, Dallas, Beaumont and
Shreveport, La., are expected to take part in an Aug. 6 rally at
the Sabine County courthouse, said Vollie Grace, president of the
Hemphill chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   ``We plan to march to the courthouse,'' Grace said Wednesday.
``We'll be protesting the outcome of the trial.''
   Last week, the three lawmen _ Hemphill Police Chief Thomas
Ladner, 41, and Sabine County deputies James ``Bo'' Hyden, 35, and
Bill Horton, 58, _ were acquitted of civil rights violations in the
beating death of Loyal Garner Jr., a truck driver from Florien, La.
   Garner, 34, died of head injuries Dec. 27 in a Tyler hospital
after being arrested on a drunken driving charge Christmas Day and
taken to the Sabine County Jail.
   The three still face trial in Tyler on murder charges in
Garner's death. The trial is set to begin Aug. 8.

<TEXT>
   A team of explorers plans to raise the world's
largest 19th-century steam whaling ship from the frigid depths of
the Chukchi Sea off Alaska, and even has visions of sailing the old
vessel again.
   The 177-foot whaler Orca, which sank in September 1897 after it
got wedged between two pieces of floating ice, is like ``an
underwater time capsule,'' said project director Dan W. Shirey.
   ``We have found that the year-round, below-freezing temperatures
of the water makes the ocean environment marine organism-free. No
other area of the world can offer such ideal preservation
conditions for marine antiquities.''
   Indeed, the vessel, once the pride of America's whaling fleet,
is believed to be so well preserved that Shirey dreams of sailing
it to a new home _ perhaps next to the Queen Mary in Long Beach,
Calif., or to the South Street Seaport in New York.
   ``In this melting pot of New York, the ship could find a home
under the shadows of the lady (Statue of Liberty) herself,'' he
said at a news conference Wednesday at the Explorers Club, a
private organization of professional explorers and scientists.
   Ninety-one years ago, the Orca, owned by the Pacific Steam
Whaling Co. of San Francisco, sank, stern-first, in about 100 feet
of water off Point Franklin, Alaska. The captain and crew escaped.
   ``You couldn't have asked for a gentler shipwreck,'' said
Shirey, a former Coast Guard search-and-rescue diver who founded
the Ocean Research Center of the Arctic, a non-profit organization
for preserving the region's maritime heritage. It was established
in 1985 at Point Barrow, Alaska.
   On Aug. 6, he will lead a team of nine explorers to a base camp
at Peard Bay, Alaska. They will survey and photograph the wreck
using small boats, sonar and remote-controlled, undersea vehicles,
until about Sept. 30, when the ice moves back into place for the
winter.
   The $2.5 million Phase 2 _ dredging beneath the 628-ton vessel,
attaching large slings to its frame and lifting it with barges _ is
to begin late next summer.
   Time is limited, because a proposed offshore pipeline might
disturb the historic wreck, Shirey said at the Explorers Club,
which is underwriting the $150,000 first phase.
   ``We found the whaling ship's timbers to be worm-free and as
structurally strong as if they were hewn and assembled in 1987,''
said Shirey.
   Scott Murray, dive coordinator, said that in 1982, he helped
raise a 186-foot metal ship that sank in the 1930s in Panama. But
no vessel as old as the Orca has ever been recovered whole, he said.

   When he saw one of the characters in the
movie ``Wall Street'' led away in handcuffs after being arrested
for insider trading, Tom Dorsey thought about his newest employee
and smiled at the irony.
   The movie character faced the prospect of adjusting to life in
prison. Dorsey's employee, Thomas Walker, is finding his niche in
the world of finance after being paroled from the State
Penitentiary.
   The convicted felon is a graduate of an investment strategies
course Dorsey taught in the prison. Walker kept in touch with
Dorsey until his release last November and now is a securities
analyst for Dorsey, Wright and Associates.
   ``He created his own position,'' Dorsey said. ``He would come in
at night and read the wires and work with the computers on his own,
and eventually I started giving him certain tasks. Before long, he
became instrumental in the operation.''
   Walker, 31, was convicted in 1979 of arson, armed robbery,
burglary and solicitation for murder and was sentenced to 36 years
in prison.
   ``I don't know if I could have gotten a job in this business if
it hadn't been for Tommy,'' Walker said. ``Getting your foot in the
door is the hardest part.''
   Walker, who was a business administration major at The College
of William & Mary before he ran afoul of the law, said that before
college he already had met ``a lot of people who were maybe a
little shady.''
   ``Most of the things we were involved in were burglary and
arson,'' he said. ``We always rationalized what we did by saying
our victims were probably insured.''
   Walker said the solicitation for murder conviction was based on
an undercover officer's testimony that he tried to have the officer
kill three people who had testified against him.
   Walker said it was the excitement of ``living on the edge'' that
prompted his criminal behavior.
   ``It's like turning on `Miami Vice,''' he said. ``You can either
sit there and watch it, or you can play `Miami Vice.' I was playing
it.''
   Dorsey, who was a vice president at Wheat First Securities
before opening his own business in 1987, said Walker's criminal
background likely would have kept him out of other firms.
   ``There's no way we could have hired him at Wheat,'' he said.
``But all I care about is performance. I don't give a damn if he
has been in prison.''
   Walker had served three years when he signed up for Dorsey's
first investment strategies course.
   ``I was always interested in business anyway,'' said Walker, who
is continuing his education at Virginia Commonwealth University.
``When I heard about Tommy's course, bells and whistles went off.''
   Dorsey's course started with the basics of supply and demand,
and he used the analogy of convicts swapping or selling cigarettes
to illustrate his lessons. When the students advanced further, they
were given a fictitious $15,000 to invest with prize money going to
the three who made the greatest profit.
   ``I didn't do very well with my $15,000,'' Walker said. ``I was
too conservative.''
   But Dorsey still was impressed.
   ``He was one of the more quiet and reserved students,'' Dorsey
said. ``But he never missed a class, and he always completed his
assignments on time. It was obvious he was serious about this.''

   A typhoon that slammed into the southern city of
Shantou killed at least six people and caused millions of dollars
in damage to ships, homes, power lines and rice paddies, officials
said today.
   Typhoon Warren hit Shantou and neighboring counties in coastal
Guangdong province on Tuesday night with 80 mph winds and
torrential rains before dissipating inland.
   The overseas edition of the People's Daily today reported six
deaths and 70 people injured in the Shantou municipal district.
   But the China News Service said 106 were injured. It said total
damage from the storm was estimated at $160 million.
   Li Lieqin of the Shantou Foreign Affairs Office said by
telephone that six of the injured were hit when a wall toppled over
at a chemical plant. He said one person was in serious condition.
   China News said the typhoon washed away 147 hydraulic projects,
toppled more than 4,000 houses and 14,300 huts and damaged 38,000
other houses during its 16-hour strike. It said more than 432,000
acres of crops were damaged.
   The People's Daily estimated the damage to rice paddies at $9.5
million and said $6 million worth of fruit trees were uprooted. Li
said there was heavy damage in particular to the region's orange
and banana crops.
   The news service said the typhoon damaged telephone
communications, knocked down four bridges, smashed more than 30
miles of roads and destroyed nearly 200 ships, seven of which sank.
   The People's Daily said hundreds of electric poles were knocked
down and more than 19 miles of river embankments and 16 miles of
see levees washed out. Li said four bridges in the Shantou area
were destroyed but did not say how big they were.
   The city's electricity and telephone service were restored today
after a 24-hour outage.
   Guangdong provincial officials said there were no deaths or
extensive damage in Canton, a city of more than 2 million about 190
miles southwest of Shantou.
   Details of cleanup operations were not disclosed. Li said armed
police were called in before the typhoon hit to take protective
measures at the Shantou oil depot, and the air force battened down
the city airport.
   Peasants in the area, warned of the coming storm, labored the
day before the typhoon hit to bring in grain, but Li said early
estimates showed 55,000 tons were lost.
   Southeastern China was battered by heavy rains and flooding in
May and June. Official reports said five people were killed and 370
injured in Guangdong and at least 171 were killed in neighboring
provinces in those storms.

   Two prominent members of Bulgaria's
Politburo were dropped from the ruling Communist party body, the
official Bulgarian news agency BTA said.
   It said Choudomir Alexandrov, 52, was dropped Wednesday and
relieved of his duties as a secretary of the Central Committee at
his own request.
   Alexandrov became a Politburo member in 1984 and a Central
Committee secretary in 1986 and was seen last year as a potential
successor to Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov.
   Veteran Communist Stanko Todorov, whose wife Sonya
Bakish-Todorova joined an unofficial committee to protect the
environment, also was dropped from the Politburo at his own
request, BTA said.
   It said the policy-making Central Committee dropped Svetlin
Roussev, an artist who led the environmental committee.
   BTA did not say whether the officials would get other top party
or government posts or who their replacements would be.

<HEAD>Vietnam Wants Reimbursement Of Expenses For Rescuing Fliers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>

   Vietnam has asked the United States to
pay all expenses involved in its rescue of three U.S. Navy aviators
whose plane made an emergency landing in the South China Sea, a
U.S. Embassy spokesman said today.
   ``Vietnamese authorities have asked the U.S. government to pay
all expenses involved in the rescue, transportation and
accomodations of the crew members. This request is under review,''
said spokesman Bill Schauer.
   He said the request was made while arrangements were being made
for the return of the aviators.
   Vietnam's communist government previously has demanded large
sums for the return of Americans and other foreigners picked up in
its territorial waters.
   A spokesman for the Vietnamese embassy said he had no
information on the request.
   The aviators flew out of Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon, on Tuesday and returned to Subic Bay Naval Base in the
Philippines. They said they were grateful to Vietnamese authorities
for the good treatment they received.
   The aviators were the pilot, Lt. Richard K. Maurer, 30, of
Harvey's Lake, Pa.; the pregnant co-pilot, Lt. j.g. Elizabeth A.
Steinnecker, 29, of Corpus Christi, Texas; and Petty Officer First
Class Michael A. Neel, 34, of Albuquerque, New Mexico.
   U.S. Embassy officials in Bangkok said the three were flying
back to base from Singapore on July 12 when the navigational
equipment on their CT-39E twin-engine jet failed and they couldn't
make it to Malaysia for a scheduled refueling stop.
   They landed in the sea in the vicinity of the Spratly islands,
some of which are occupied by Vietnamese military forces.
Vietnamese navy vessels took them to the mainland.

<HEAD>Cruise: Nothing Romantic About Movie Love Scenes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heartthrob Tom Cruise says growing up with three
sisters helped him learn to understand women, but he confesses
there's not much real romance in front of the camera.
   ``With sisters, you always got the inside scoop on what they
thought about their boyfriends and what women like,'' he says in
the Aug. 8 issue of Us magazine.
   Still, doing love scenes ``is not a comfortable situation for
anyone,'' says Cruise, the star of ``Risky Business,'' ``Top Gun''
and ``The Color of Money.''
   ``There is nothing romantic about 20 guys behind the camera,
telling you to move to your left and, `Sorry, we missed that shot.'
''
   Cruise's ninth movie, ``Cocktail,'' opens later this month.

   Eighteen peace demonstrators were arrested,
police destroyed a bag apparently holding juice instead of a bomb,
and a goose was held hostage for the homeless outside the
Democratic National Convention.
   Also Wednesday, Vietnam veterans ended a 72-hour vigil,
supporters of Tawana Brawly demonstrated and 126 abortion opponents
arrested Tuesday continued to sit in jail because they refused to
give authorities their names.
   The 18 activists from No Business as Usual were arrested after
entering the U.S. Department of Energy regional office during a
larger demonstration by the anti-nuclear weapons group, said Jackie
Barrett of the convention police command center.
   Shortly afterward, a bag found outside was destroyed by the
police bomb squad, said Ms. Barrett.
   She initially said the bag contained an explosive device, but
later reported: ``It was not an explosive. It was a clear liquid.
We're thinking it was apple juice.''
   Homer the goose _ a real, honking goose _ appeared in the
designated demonstration area outside the convention site with
members of the Street People's Advisory Committee, an Austin,
Texas, advocacy group for the homeless.
   Several months ago, the street people had vowed to kill Homer,
then a tiny gosling they had bought for $8, unless more attention
was paid to the homeless. Homer lived.
   ``He's here to speak out about the problems of the homeless,''
James Williams, president of the group, said as the goose honked
and chased after bystanders' feet.
   Wednesday evening, as veterans appealed to the Democrats to get
an accounting of the Americans missing in Southeast Asia, the same
group staged an impromptu rally in a street adjacent to the protest
area. Police cleared the street, taking four people into custody.
   Jere Beery of Newnan, Ga., coordinator of the National
Forget-Me-Not Association for POWs and MIAs, said he would like to
see actress Jane Fonda intervene on behalf of MIAs.
   Miss Fonda's apology to Vietnam veterans for her trip to North
Vietnam during the conflict, ``has broken the ice,'' he said. ``She
has said she is sorry, but can we trust that? We need some sign.''
   Former POW John Parcells urged Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis to appoint the Rev. Jesse Jackson as a special
envoy to Vietnam to work for an accounting of Americans who are
missing, dead or being held prisoner in Southeast Asia.
   In the same two-acre parking lot near The Omni arena, about 60
people rallied in support of Tawana Brawley, the 16-year-old New
York girl who maintains that she was the victim of a sexual and
racial assault but who has refused to cooperate with prosecutors.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, Miss Brawley's adviser, attacked nominee
Michael Dukakis, calling on him to state his positions on injustice
against black people.
   Miss Brawley looked on expressionless during the rally, which
also featured independent presidential candidate Lenora Fulani of
New York, whose campaign has become a fixture in the protest area.
   Across town, 126 abortion opponents arrested earlier continued
to sit in jail Wednesday because they refused to give authorities
their names. They were allowed to visit with their relatives
through a jailyard fence.

<HEAD>Judge Says Sterilization May Ease Sentence for Child's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pregnant 29-year-old woman facing prison
for fatally poisoning her son could receive a lenient sentence if
she is sterilized, a judge said.
   ``She has no need for any more children. I can't order this, but
she could consider sterilization. It would be a mitigating
circumstance,'' said Superior Court Judge Roy F. Jones at a hearing
Wednesday on the medical status of Melody Baldwin.
   Jones' proposal was called ``outrageous'' by the Indiana Civil
Liberties Union.
   Miss Baldwin, whose baby is due in September, pleaded guilty
June 10 to child neglect. She could be sentenced to 20 years in
prison for admitting she gave Joshua Baldwin, 4, a fatal dose of a
depressant in May 1986.
    Miss Baldwin's sentencing was postponed last week because of
medical problems, including excessive vomiting. She was under close
observation in a psychiatric ward after trying to remove an
intravenous tube supplying her and the fetus with nutrition.
   She was not in court Wednesday, but her lawyer, Michael J.
Donahoe, said he would tell her about the sterilization proposal.
Miss Baldwin has already agreed to put her unborn child up for
adoption.
   Timothy L. Bookwalter, a lawyer appointed by the judge to guard
the fetus's interests, favors sterilization.
   ``We can't protect her every time she gets pregnant. She is a
dangerous person and could kill this kid too,'' he said.
   ICLU attorney Richard Waples said Jones' proposal was
``outrageous'' and an impermissible condition of sentencing.
   ``The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the sterilization of
criminals in 1942,'' Waples said.
   During Wednesday's hearing, psychiatrist Dr. Balwant S. Mallik
said Miss Baldwin was sane but had a personality disorder and was
suicidal.

   Crumbling bridges, pot-hole filled streets,
work and insurance benefits complicated by AIDS, child care,
education and the environment are just some of the issues faced by
the nation's lawmakers.
   Some will be addressed by the National Conference of State
Legislatures, which opens its six-day annual conference here Sunday.
   ``Some of the things that will be discussed will see easy
agreement, others will be controversial and you won't get anyone to
vote the same way,'' said Susan Seladones, the group's director of
public affairs.
   ``It's going to be very interesting to see what comes out of the
meeting. Our policies that we adopt do not tell the states what to
do but it shows where we stand on state and federal issues.''
   The lawmakers will meet throughout the week in standing
committees ranging from health and human services and agriculture
to economic development and education.
   Concerns include gun control, workers compensation in light of
the fatal disease AIDS, medical malpractice, conflict of interest
in government, pay equity, welfare reform and the homeless.
   The committees' final resolutions will go before the entire
meeting in a sort of legislative floor session Thursday. Those
approved by three-fourths of the lawmakers attending the general
session will be forwarded to Congress as recommendations, Ms.
Seladones said.
   ``The whole thing is about leadership and the future,'' she
said. ``We want to send a states' message to Congress about what we
want.
   ``We've been working for the past eight or nine months to come
up with something on reducing the federal deficit, which we think
will lead to a pretty interesting debate on the floor.''
   About 20 percent or 1,500 of the state legislators in the U.S.
and Puerto Rico are expected to attend the 14th annual conference.
Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
or his vice presidential running mate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
have been invited to speak.
   ``We haven't got their committments yet, but in the past we've
had presidential candidates speak and we are usually told about two
days before,'' Ms. Seladones said.
   Time has been set aside for Bush to speak at a luncheon on
Tuesday and for Dukakis or Bentsen on Thursday, she added.
   Other speakers include author David Halberstam, Time magazine
contributing editor Hugh Sidey and syndicated political columnists
Robert Novak and Carl Rowan.
   Dr. Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, also is scheduled to discuss his
institute's report on urban education.
   Including legislative staff, government officials, families,
speakers and reporters, the conference is expected to host a record
6,000-7,000 people, according to William Pound, executive director
of the legislatures' group.
   The conference is expected to cost $700,000 with most of the
money coming from donations and Nevada contributing $150,000.

<TEXT>
   Residents of the ancestral home of Michael
Dukakis feasted on lamb, danced and drank ouzo toasts early today
at an all-night party to celebrate his nomination as the Democratic
presidential candidate.
   More than 200 people gathered at the village cafe cheered wildly
as state-run Greek television announced in its midnight newscast
that the Massachusetts governor was ``certain to get the
nomination.''
   ``It's an important event for our village tonight, it's one more
step towards the November election,'' said Costas Stefanou, 42,
president of the this mountain village of 640 residents on the
northern Aegean island of Mytilene.
   The crowd toasted the man they call ``our Michalis'' with beer
and ouzo, an anise-flavored drink that is an island specialty. Then
they feasted on spit-roast lamb and danced to bouzouki music,
watched by a line of children perched on a fence wearing ``Mike
Dukakis for President'' buttons.
   Both of Dukakis' paternal grandparents were born in Pelopi but
moved away in the 1880s to open a store in the Turkish town of
Edremit, where the governor's father was born. Edremit is 40 miles
from Mytilene across a narrow Aegean Sea strait.
   A local priest, the Rev. Lefteris Kamiris, said that Nov. 8, the
presidential election date, is ``especially auspicious'' for the
island.
   ``Now that Michalis has the nomination, there's no way he's not
going to get elected on that day,'' Kamiris said.
   Kamiris said Nov. 8 is the feast-day of St. Michael, the patron
saint of Pelopi. That day, too, marks the date in 1921 that
Mytilene was granted independence from Turkish rule.
   Kamiris, who paints icons _ sacred pictures of saints displayed
in Greek Orthodox churches _ also was responsible for the signs
that identify Pelopi in Greek and English as ``the hometown of
Michael Dukakis.''
   ``We feel proud that someone from our island can get so far.
It's changed our lives,'' he said.
   A trickle of tourists has started coming to Pelopi, looking for
the Dukakis family home.
   ``All the visitors bothered us a bit at first, but we don't mind
now. It's good to have people wanting to visit the house where it
all started,'' said Yiannis Manolis, whose father bought and
rebuilt the ruined Dukakis home in 1933.
   The yellowing sale contract signed by Panos Dukakis, the
governor's father, is proudly shown to visitors.
   Panos Dukakis emigrated to the United States in 1913 and became
the first Greek-American to graduate from Harvard Medical School.
   The village council already has renamed the main street Michael
Dukakis Street and intends to offer the presidential candidate a
mountainside plot of land where he can build a summer home.
   ``Michalis could do some gardening, maybe grow watermelons,''
said Stefanou, who recalled that on his one and only visit to
Pelopi in 1976, the governor enjoyed the local melons.
   ``We're proud that someone who hails from Pelopi might become
the most powerful man in the world,'' said Alexander Chiotellis,
who acted as Dukakis' host on that visit and claims to be his
second cousin.
   The villagers, mostly sheep- and goat breeders, also say a
Dukakis election victory might improve the quality of life in
Pelopi.
   ``If he's elected the government may finally decide to pave the
top part of the road to the village. After all, if he comes here as
president he can't drive up a dirt track,'' Stefanou said.
   A self-styled local poet already has composed what he calls an
``Ode to Dukakis''.
   ``Dukakis comes from our village, our beautiful island of
Lesbos,'' Eleftherios Yiannakos recited on Wednesday night.
   Lesbos is the ancient Greek name for Mytilene.
   ``All the villagers are lovingly concerned to see him as
president in America,'' the 20-line poem continues.

<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Virginia man and woman were sentenced
to 120 days in jail for crimes committed in Utah during what a
judge called ``a cross-country criminal lark.''
   In addition to the jail time, Ronald Allen Feathers, 18, of
Winchester, Va., and Angie Smith, 20, of Strausburg, Va., were
placed on 18 months probation and ordered to pay $471.15 in
restitution.
   The pair allegedly stole a car in Front Royal, Va., abandoned it
later, stole another car in Ponchatoole, La., and drove it through
Utah, according to a Washington County sheriff's report.
   The report said the couple then drove to Wichita, Kan., where
they allegedly stole a briefcase from a pickup truck that contained
credit cards and used the cards to purchase gas and oil.
   Later, the couple allegedly stole a small travel trailer in
Colorado and abandoned it in Utah, where another trailer was
stolen, authorities said.
   They were apprehended by police in Utah after an officer noticed
the trailer had no tail lights and learned the vehicle had been
stolen.
   In 5th District Court Wednesday, Judge J. Philip Eves told
Feathers he couldn't believe the couple got as far as they did.
   Court documents presented during the pair's appearance show they
were charged with auto thefts in Colorado, Mississippi and
Virginia, credit card theft in Kansas, various criminal charges in
Louisiana and several federal charges.
   The Utah jail time for both will be waived if they are
extradited to face charges in other states or federal charges, Eves
said.

   Police said today they have destroyed
the criminal records of about 38,000 people sent to army
``re-education'' camps in a 1980 crackdown on dissent.
   Police said the names were removed from police computers and
other lists to prevent unfair treatment of the former suspects.
Having such a record would make it difficult to get employment.
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan sent tens of thousands of people
to army barracks for ``re-education'' periods of four to six months
in an extensive crackdown in 1980 after he seized power with
military backing.
   Authorities said at the time that people sent to the camps were
criminals and hooligans. Dissidents contend many were
anti-government activists and innocent of any crimes.
   Dissidents have claimed a number of people were killed or
injured in the camps.
   Army Chief of Staff Lee Jong-ku told the National Assembly
Wednesday that the army operated the re-education camps in 1980 to
``purify'' criminals. Opposition lawmakers called for government
compensation to victims.

   The death of a vice officer who was wounded twice
during a robbery and shot a third time after pleading with the
gunman for his life was a ``cold-blooded execution,'' police said.
   Homicide investigators said late Wednesday they had no new leads
and have made no arrests in the death of Officer Elston Howard, 26,
who was to be married in two weeks.
   They said, however, they have a good description of the gunman
because 30 minutes before the slaying late Tuesday at a 24-hour
adult bookstore, another nearby bookstore was robbed. Police said
the description of the robber fit that of the man who shot Howard.
   Howard was behind the counter with a clerk at the Mr. Peepers
bookstore issuing a citation for violating a city arcade ordinance
when the gunman walked in, police spokesman Dan Turner said.
   The gunman ``noticed the officer was wearing a (Houston police)
raid jacket and at that point shot the officer at least twice,''
Turner said.
   After the gunman fired, the officer attempted to struggle with
the armed suspect, police spoksman Al Baker said.
   ``The officer fell to the ground and as he was laying on the
ground, begging the suspect not to shoot at him anymore, the
suspect fired again,'' he said.
   ``It was just a straight, cold-blooded execution,'' homicide
Sgt. John Silva said.
   The gunman then robbed the clerk, telling him, ``Give me the
money or you're going to be next,'' Silva said. The man fled in a
vehicle with a small amount of cash.
   Howard's partner was moving their unmarked police car when the
shooting occurred and did not realize what had happened, police
said.
   Howard had been with the police department for five years and is
the first Houston police officer killed in the line of duty in six
years.
   In January, Dallas police Officer John Chase was killed while
begging for his life from a vagrant man standing over him with the
officer's own gun, taken during a scuffle. The vagrant was cheered
on to shoot by several bystanders.

<TEXT>
   A 59-year-old bus driver with lung
cancer he said was caused by smokers riding in his bus was awarded
$52,000 from the Melbourne Transit Authority.
   The Victoria state government's Accident Compensation Tribunal
heard Sean Carroll's claim and on Wednesday ordered the authority
to pay him $24,000 in compensation and $28,000 in damages for
negligent exposure to tobacco smoke.
   Carroll, who was diagnosed with cancer in February, was exposed
to the smoke for 24 years at work, said Stephen Woodward, executive
director of the anti-smoking group Action on Smoking and Health.
   Woodward said today that the passive smoking award was the first
of its kind in Australia.
   ``I predict that all of Australia's workplaces will be
smoke-free in 1989,'' he said. ``Any employer who continues to
allow smoking at work is taking a grave risk with both workers
compensation and common law claims.''
   Carroll drove Melbourne buses beginning in 1952. Smoking was
banned on public transportation in 1976.
   The transit authority could not be reached immediately for
comment.
   Australian laws restricting smoking are among the world's most
stringent, prohibiting it from all government offices, domestic air
flights and public transportation.

<HEAD>Snake-Draped Mayor Kicks Off `National Voodoo Week'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mayor who donned a white turban, red cape
and two rubber snakes as he proclaimed ``National Voodoo Week'' is
an ``embarrassment'' and should be removed from office, Alabama's
attorney general said.
   But Florala Mayor H.T. Mathis, 85, said he was only seeking
publicity Wednesday with his candle-lit midnight news conference
near a table covered with Halloween masks and a black, rubber bat.
   Attorney General Don Siegelman has accused Mathis of
mismanagement and improperly pardoning drunken drivers. Mathis is
fighting the charges and faces an impeachment trial next month.
   ``He continues to be a threat to the public safety and an
embarrassment to the people of Florala and Covington County,''
Siegelman said.
   Mathis said the voodoo week is aimed at promoting publicity and
peace for his town of 2,200 on the Alabama-Florida border.
   Mathis denied believing in black magic and said the media had
turned him into the ``voodoo mayor,'' so he would use the
opportunity for publicity.
   ``The voodoo story, like a television commercial, has notified
thousands of people that Florala is a solid little town and it's
ideally located for any type of industry,'' Mathis said.
   Mathis attracted national attention last fall when he sprinkled
what he said was ``voodoo dust'' around City Hall.
   Following the initial reports of the voodoo dust, Mathis said
the powder actually was cornstarch he placed there because the
police chief believed in voodoo. The chief denied such beliefs.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Mathis said the powder was
neither voodoo dust nor cornstarch.
   ``Back right after I was elected we had some information that we
had some witchcraft going on in City Hall, and we figured it was
making a difference. Somebody gave me the idea that if I sprinkled
sulfur and put up some pictures of owls that would take care of it,
scare them.
   ``They tell me people who are interested in witchcraft are
definitely scared of sulfur. Sure enough, the so-called police
chief came in and pitched a fit. What it was, I just wasn't careful
enough.''
   Police Chief A.V. Patrick has denied believing in the occult,
but declined to comment Wednesday. ``I just don't put nothing in
the paper. I don't even want to talk about it.''

   Doctors at the University of Alabama say
they have no plans to trade their scalpels for spatulas and make a
few bucks flipping burgers.
   Officials for a group of some 500 physicians in the non-profit
Alabama Health Services Foundation say they probably will sell
their Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers franchise, purchased in
March to get the land for a planned $103.5 million outpatient
clinic.
   The doctors paid $1.6 million for the land near the university
campus and the $400,000 for the hamburger franchise rights, said
Dick Briggs Jr., acting president of the foundation.
   The restaurant remains open, ``but,'' Briggs said, ``we don't
have any long-range visions of making our fortunes in the burger
business.''
   After all, he said, ``It may be hard to push
cholesterol-lowering diets in our building with a Wendy's next
door.''

   A Michigan Supreme Court justice saw two men
trying to swipe a $79 television set from his downtown office and
even offered to help them.
   Justice Dennis Archer thought the 5-inch black-and-white set
they were taking from the 14th floor of the Lafayette Building
about noon Wednesday looked familiar.
   When he offered to lend a hand, ``They laughed and one said,
`No, we're waiting for my aunt,''' Archer said.
   He returned to his office and noticed his set was missing.
   The justice then rounded up a group to collar the men. They
split up into two teams, said Archer, who along with Ken
Poindexter, a maintenance man, nabbed the pair.
   ``You security?'' one of the men asked the justice.
   ``I guess you could say that I'm the biggest security you've
ever seen,'' Archer told him. But when he explained who he was,
``it didn't seem to register.''
   Police said the men, ages 21 and 23, were being held on breaking
and entering charges.

<HEAD>Opposition Wants Election Before Trade Bill Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has rejected an
opposition demand that he call a general election before the
ratification of a historic trade agreement with the United States.
   ``At an appropriate time, there will be an election,'' the
Conservative leader said Wednesday.
   Mulroney and President Reagan signed the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement on Jan. 2. The treaty would eliminate tariffs in the $150
billion a year trading partnership and dismantle non-tariff
barriers in investment, energy and other sectors.
   The issue of free trade with the United States has divided
Candians for a century.
   During a heated exchange in the House of Commons on Wednesday,
the opposition Liberal Party vowed to block ratification until
Mulroney calls an election.
   Liberal leader John Turner said Canadians have a right to vote
on the wisdom of linking their economy more closely with the United
States.
   ``Let the people decide,'' he said. ``This is a basic democratic
issue allowing the people of Canada to decide on a matter which is
critical to our future.''
   Turner, who served briefly as prime minister in 1984, maintains
that a trade pact would make Canada subservient to its giant
neighbor.
   Unable to defeat the deal in the elected House of Commons, where
Mulroney's Conservatives have 208 of the 282 seats, Turner asked
the Liberal majority in the appointed Senate to delay passage until
after a general election.
   The upper chamber has amending powers that can delay legislation
for a year or more.
   Liberal Senate leader Allan MacEachen said the chamber would
comply with Turner's request.
   The Free Trade Agreement is scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1,
1989, provided Parliament and U.S. Congress pass implementing
legislation. The Reagan administration is expected to introduce the
final legislative package to Congress next week.
   Sen. Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W. Va., said Wednesday that
a Canadian election wouldn't automatically hold up U.S. approval of
the agreement.
   The House of Commons approved it in principle July 6 and has
scheduled a third and final reading in mid-August after committee
hearings. The legislation then goes to the Senate, which has a
large Liberal majority.
   Canada's two opposition parties, the Liberals and socialist New
Democrats, accuse Mulroney of sacrificing the nation's sovereignty.
   But Mulroney claims the deal will create prosperity and shield
Canada from U.S. protectionism.
   ``We have today a violation of one of the most fundamental
precepts of British parliamentary democracy, where the leader of
the Liberal Party asks (the Senate) to hijack the most fundamental
rights of the Canadian House of Commons,'' the prime minister said.
   Turner said that if the Conservatives are re-elected, the Senate
would pass the free-trade legislation quickly, before the Jan. 1
effective date.
   Mulroney's five-year term expires in September 1989, but he can
call an election any time. Prime ministers usually choose the
fourth year of their mandate, but Mulroney has delayed an election
call until Parliament passes free-trade and other key legislation.
   Turner's action could force Mulroney to rethink his strategy and
go to the voters this fall. Canadian election campaigns normally
last two months.
   This means that if Mulroney wants to get the bill passed in time
for the start-up date of the trade deal, an election must be called
by about mid-October.

<HEAD>North Korea Recommends North, South, Debate Non-Agression Draft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea today proposed a meeting of all North
Korean and South Korean legislators to debate a declaration of
non-aggression drafted by the North.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the
proposal was made in a letter today to South Korea's National
Assembly speaker, Kim Chae-sun.
   The news agency said the letter was from Chairman Yang Hyong Sop
of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. It proposed that the
meeting be held in August in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang,
said the news report monitored in Tokyo.
   There was no immediate reaction in Seoul to the North's proposal.
   Both Koreas have proposed non-aggression pacts in the past.
However, this was the first time a proposal was made to debate a
non-aggression pact through a joint South-North parliamentary
meeting, said Radio Press, a Japanese agency that monitors
communist broadcasts.
   Korea was split into the communist North and the capitalist
South at the end of World War II in 1945. The divided halves fought
the three-year Korean War that ended in an armistice signed between
the U.S.-backed United Nations Command and North Korea on July 27,
1953.
   A full text of the letter, carried by KCNA, said the North
proposes the joint parliamentary meetings be held alternately in
Seoul and Pyongyang, following the proposed initial session in the
North Korean capital, with Yang and Kim serving as co-chairmen.
   Yang would preside over the meetings in Pyongyang and Kim over
the ones in Seoul, it said.
   In Seoul, Kim's aides confirmed the National Assembly speaker
recieved the North Korean letter through the truce village of
Panmunjom inside the Korean demilitarized zone. The officials,
however, said the contents of the letter would be distributed to
the various political parties in the National Assembly before it
was made public.
   The North's letter read: ``All the participants will take part
freely in the debate of agenda items, and as for the method of
adoption, it will be good, we think, to decide by majority in
combination of ballots and show of hands, making our deputies
equivalent to your members for the fairness and justness, though
the number of our deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly is
bigger than yours.''
   The North's rubber-stamp parliament, which meets only several
days during an annual regular session in February or March, had 655
members when it was elected in November 1986. The South's National
Assembly has 299 members, 166 of them opposition members.

   The High Court today awarded $1.126 million in
damages to a woman who suffered massive brain injuries during an
abortion.
   Pearl Cunningham, a 46-year-old mother of three, suffered a
heart attack that led to brain damage during the operation at
Dulwich Hospital in southeast London in January 1983.
   The award of 655,126 pounds against Camberwell Health Authority
is one of the highest in Britain for medical negligence. A record
1.03 million pounds ($1.77 million) was awarded last summer to a
student who suffered brain damage caused by negligent care at a
hospital.
   Hedley Cunningham, who brought the malpractice suit on his
wife's behalf, said he was not satisfied with the award and would
seek legal advice about an appeal.
   ``It is far from a big award,'' he said.
   The Camberwell Health Authority admitted liability but was
contesting the amount of damages.
   Mrs. Cunningham, a former nurse, can speak and enjoy her
family's company but cannot coordinate the movement of her limbs,
said her lawyer, Benet Hytner.
   The judge, Sir Philip Otton, praised the ``heavy burden''
shouldered by Cunningham, 47, who quit his job as a security guard
to care for his wife and their three children.
   Doctors allowed Cunningham to take his wife home in December
1985. The judge said she would require full-time care and
supervision for the rest of her life.

<HEAD>Five Workers Disciplined At TMI After Sleeping Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five managers at the Three Mile Island 2
nuclear plant have been disciplined for not doing enough to stop a
control room supervisor from sleeping on the job, the plant
operator says.
   GPU Nuclear Corp. said Wednesday it had fired an employee,
reassigned two and reprimanded two.
   The action was prompted by an independent report critical of
management's role in dealing with the sleeping allegations, said
GPU spokesman Doug Bedell.
   Following company policy, the workers were not identified.
   The report, by former New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice
director Edwin H. Stier, concluded that managers did not
aggressively investigate allegations in 1986 and 1987 that the
control room shift supervisor was sleeping on duty, thus indirectly
allowing the situation to continue.
   The shift supervisor was fired Nov. 27 after an earlier report
by Stier found the sleeping had occurred as early as 1983 and
continued into 1987.
   The Unit 2 reactor, site of the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident, has been shut down since 1979. The shift
supervisor oversees staff, fire-protection systems and radiation
monitors at the plant.
   The latest report said management failed to probe the
allegations fully, accepted denials by the supervisor and
discounted others' statements, resulting in ``inaccurate and
distorted information'' being passed on to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
   ``There was a breakdown in communication between the operating
crews and the GPU managers immediately above them ... such that the
managers failed to learn the extent of (the supervisor's)
inattentiveness,'' the report said.
   NRC spokesman Karl Abraham said the agency had received the
report but had not made a determination whether there were any
regulatory violations.
   Bedell acknowledged that the allegations had been handled poorly.
   ``They (managers) didn't get a full picture of what occurred.
The situation festered,'' Bedell said. ``We have lessons to learn
as far as supervisory techniques. This was not handled well.''
   Kay Pickering, a spokeswoman for TMI Alert, a citizens' group,
said the report underscores continuing problems at TMI.
   ``We feel GPU still does not have a handle on good management.
Reading between the lines ... there are still serious problems,''
she said.
   A $1 billion cleanup has been under way at TMI-2 since the 1979
accident. TMI-1, the plant's twin, was undamaged in the accident
and was restarted in 1985.

<TEXT>
   The Legislature has authorized $33 million
in industrial revenue bonds to finance construction of a rocket
fuel plant in southern Utah to replace one destroyed by an
explosion in Nevada.
   The bill, supported by Gov. Norm Bangerter, would benefit the
Pacific Engineering and Production Co.
   The company is looking at one site in Utah and two in Nevada to
replace its Henderson, Nev., plant, which was destroyed May 4. Two
people died in the blast and fire.
   The company makes ammonium perchlorate, a fuel component used in
the space shuttle booster rockets and solid-fuel missiles such as
the MX and Minuteman.
   Kerr-McGee Corp. operates the only remaining U.S. plant
manufacturing the component. Members of Congress have expressed
fear of a critical shortage of the chemical.
   Company spokesman Keith Rooker said a site would be chosen soon
_ ``certainly by next week.''
   The bond authorization bill passed the House 64-2 following
several hours of debate Wednesday and was quickly approved 23-1 in
the Senate.
   Pacific Engineering has said it must break ground on the plant
by Aug. 1 and begin production by Feb. 1 to meet contractual
obligations. The company said current employees would be offered
jobs first, even if the plant were relocated to Utah.

   Factories were operating and mass transit was
running today in the Armenian republic despite a strike call by
activists seeking to annex a part of neighboring Azerbaijan,
residents and state-run media said.
   Soviet authorities increased pressure on leaders of the
5-month-old campaign to make Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia. The
government on Wednesday ordered a leading Armenian nationalist,
Paruyr Ayrikyan, stripped of his citizenship and expelled.
   Speakers at a Wednesday night rally in Yerevan, Armenia's
capital, called for a five-day strike to protest the Soviet
leadership's refusal to alter the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
mostly Armenian enclave that has been part of Azerbaijan for 65
years.
   Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist, said the strike call had
no obvious effect in Yerevan today.
   ``The city today is working. Factories are in operation, and
mass transit is running,'' the former political prisoner said in a
telephone interview.
   The official Tass news agency, in a dispatch from the city of
1.1 million, said that since Monday ``more and more industrial
enterprises of Armenia have begun to work at a normal pace.''
   ``Those who did not work or didn't work at their full capacity
are returning to their jobs in Yerevan, Kirovakan and other
cities,'' Tass said.
   A watch officer at Armenia's Ministry of Internal Affairs, which
handles police matters, said ``everybody is working, and the
situation is normal.'' He identified himself only as Grant.
   However, a worker with the Gostelradio state broadcasting
authority in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's administrative center,
said today that a general strike begun in May in the mountain
enclave was continuing.
   ``The people are embittered,'' said the worker, who refused to
give his name. ``We don't know what to do. But we know that the
refusal to make Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia wasn't just.''
   Most Armenians are Christians, while most Azerbaijanis are
Moslem. Most of the disputed region's 160,000 people are
Aremanians. The Armenians there say they are discriminated against
by the Azerbaijanis.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, with the blessing of Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, ruled Monday that annexing the region
to Armenia would violate the Soviet Constitution, since Azerbaijan
had objected to the transfer.
   Activists said at least 400,000 people attended Wednesday's
rally near a Yerevan historical institute. Those figures could not
be independently confirmed because Moscow-based Western reporters
are prevented from traveling to the region.
   Speakers at the rally read the official Tass news agency report
about Ayrikyan's expulsion. People raised fists and shouted
``Ayrikyan, Ayrikyan! Freedom, freedom!''said an activist who spoke
on condition of anomymity.
   The Presidium on Monday also authorized police to ``take
essential measures'' to end strikes and ``any activities directed
at kindling national strife and attempts to misuse democratic
rights for anti-democratic purposes.''
   Today's Tass dispatch from Yerevan attacked leaders of the
annexation drive by name, accusing them of criminal activities and
of trying to stir up ethnic tensions.
   It said five people, including writer Vano Siradegyan and Rafael
Kazaryan of Armenia's Academy of Sciences, ``tried to provide a
cover-up for `shadow economy' dealers, for clans of career-seekers
and bribe-takers.''
   Vartan Silikyan and Martin Barsekyan, both active members of the
``Karabakh committee,'' a group created to organize the annexation
drive, were arrested when they brought 35 gasoline bombs to a
Monday rally in Yerevan, Tass said.
   It called the committee a ``group of demagogues who wish to
further their selfish aims under the cover of problems of
Nagorno-Karabakh,'' and said some members received wages during an
earlier general strike in Armenia.
   The first major target of the official crackdown was Ayrikyan,
39, who has been jailed or exiled for 17 years beginning in 1969
for his political activities.
   Tass said the Presidium stripped him of citizenship Wednesday
and expelled him ``for his active instigation to inter-ethnic
strife.'' The news agency did not say where the activist was headed
or whether he had left Soviet territory.
   Ayrikyan helped organize the drive to annex Nagorno-Karabakh and
provided frequent reports to foreign correspondents. He was
arrested March 25 and charged with defaming the Soviet state.
   Tass said he was pardoned before being expelled.

   An appellate court today reduced to six years a
prison term imposed on an American financier convicted of smuggling
$17.1 million worth of cocaine into Britain.
   The three judges reduced David Wesley Medin's nine-year sentence
after learning that the 45-year-old Detroit man agreed to testify
for the prosecution against other members of an alleged drug ring.
   Medin admitted he had worked for the Mafia.
   ``Anyone crossing the path of the Mafia is in peril of losing
his life,'' senior appeal judge Lord Watkins said. ``This appellant
is now in that select company.''
   Watkins said Britain and other European countries would have
been flooded with cocaine had the drug plot not been foiled.
   Medin was arrested in January 1987 and charged with possessing
cocaine with intent to supply. He was sentenced in April 1987.
   Scotland Yard has said Medin provided police with detailed
information on money laundering and drug-supply routes. Prosecutor
Roy Amlot said at Medin's trial that Medin cooperated and ``named
names'' in organized crime circles after his arrest.

   Actress Olympia Dukakis, who will introduce
Michael Dukakis at tonight's convention session, today compared
being his cousin to one of ``the great parts.''
   ``It's a very special time in your life,'' said Miss Dukakis,
just hours before she was to present the Democratic presidential
nominee to the delegates before a nationwide television audience,
many of whom saw her spirited pitch for him when she accepted an
Academy Award in April.
   ``My dream was and still is to play the great parts,'' she said
in an interview on CBS-TV. Asked if being the candidate's cousin is
a great part, she replied: ``It certainly is.''
   On Wednesday night, Miss Dukakis sat among the New Jersey
delegation as Dukakis formally won the nomination. Tonight she will
take to the massive convention rostrum before Dukakis delivers his
acceptance speech.
   ``The theme will be very simple: Michael Dukakis,'' the actress
said in a brief interview on the floor of the crowded Omni
convention hall. ``Michael Dukakis and the leadership and values he
will bring to America.''
   The seasoned stage and movie actress acknowledged being a bit
nervous about her appearance at center stage of the Democratic
National Convention.
   ``On Broadway you get a chance to rehearse,'' she said. ``Here I
don't get much of a chance to rehearse.''
   Dukakis' and Miss Dukakis' fathers _ both Greek immigrants _
were brothers and raised their families near each other in the
Boston area. She now lives in New Jersey, where she failed in an
attempt to win election as a delegate for Dukakis but was later
named an at-large delegate.
   When she accepted the Oscar for her supporting role in the movie
``Moonstruck,'' Miss Dukakis held the trophy high over her head and
called out: ``OK, Michael, let's go!''
   That came just before the New York primary, which Dukakis won in
the early part of a string of primary victories that secured him
the nomination.
   He returned the surprise a few weeks later, strolling
unannounced onto the set of a Boston television program as she was
being interviewed.
   In the months to follow, Dukakis would frequently tell his
campaign audiences of his and his cousin's successes, declaring
1988 ``the year of the Dukaki,'' a comment she also made backstage
after claiming her Oscar.
   Miss Dukakis spent much of her week in Atlanta doing interviews
and said she spoke to Dukakis several times. She promised to
campaign vigorously for her cousin in the fall campaign.
   She also is filming a new movie.
   When asked if perhaps 1989 would be an even better year for the
``Dukaki,'' she shrugged her shoulders in a manner characteristic
of her politician cousin.
   ``Why not?'' she asked.

<HEAD>Vietnam Pledges To Resolve 70 Priority MIA Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's foreign minister has pledged
to try to resolve by the end of the year 70 cases of missing U.S.
servicemen that the United States considers of highest priority,
Voice of Vietnam said today.
   Minister Nguyen Co Thach was quoted as saying he welcomed U.S.
participation in joint excavations for the remains of missing
servicemen.
   The United States is trying to account for nearly 1,800
Americans missing in action from the Vietnam war, which ended in
April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government.
   U.S. forces lost 58,000 soldiers during the war.
   The radio broadcast, monitored in Bangkok, said Thach wrote a
letter July 9 to retired Gen. John W. Vessey, a special
presidential envoy, in which he urged the United States to ``carry
out all agreements relating to humanitarian issues relating to
Vietnam.''
   The letter apparently referred to an August 1987 agreement
between Thach and Vessey in which Vietnam agreed to accelerate the
search for MIA remains. In return, Washington sent in medical teams
and encouraged private agencies to help the former enemy with
medical problems, including rehabilitation of veterans disabled in
the war.
   Hanoi has indicated it wants more U.S. help.
   The official radio said Vessey welcomed Vietnam's readiness to
hold joint excavations for remains. It said that in a letter
Monday, Vessey said he hoped cooperation between the two countries
could be expanded and ``also affirmed that the U.S. side will
continue trying to respond to Vietnam's humanitarian concerns.''
   In August 1987, Vessey gave Thach a list of 70 cases of missing
U.S. servcemen, and he asked Vietnam to pursue them on a priority
basis. Washington says that in these so-called ``discrepancy
cases,'' there is strong evidence the Vietnamese know what happened
to the missing men.
   Voice of Vietnam said: ``Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach affirms Vietnam's efforts to solve before the end of this
year 70 cases of Americans missing in action considered priority by
the U.S. side. He welcomes the U.S. side for joint efforts in
seeking out and excavating the remains of MIAs in August, September
and October this year.''
   In late 1985, the two countries carried out a joint excavation
of a U.S. B-52 crash site to search for remains, but there have
been no additional excavations despite Vietnamese pledges to hold
them.
   This month, Vietnam turned over what were believed to be the
remains of 25 U.S. servicemen, one of the largest returns of
remains since the war ended.

   Palestinians today marched, blocked roads and
smashed windows to protest Israel's shutdown of Arab schools.
Hospital officials said Israeli troops shot and killed two marchers
and wounded 12 in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Violent demonstrations broke out elsewhere in the occupied West
Bank and in Jerusalem. Israeli authorities ordered that today would
be the final day of classes for more than 300,000 Palestinian
students.
   The army said it imposed a curfew on the 120,000 Arabs living
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, after a protest broke out in
the city's outdoor market.
   The military command reported one Palestinian was killed and one
wounded and said the army was checking the circumstances of the
death.
   Hospital officials and Israel radio said two Palestinians were
killed. Two Nablus hospitals reported a total of 12 wounded, most
in the arms and legs. Among those reported wounded were two
13-year-old boys shot in the legs.
   The deaths brought to 230 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising against 21 years of Israeli occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died.
   In the Gaza Strip, Israel confined 90,000 refugee camp residents
in Jebaliya and Khan Yunis to their homes after workers went on
strike and Arab youths stoned cars and burned tires.
   Israel ordered classes to end today, a month early. The military
government has closed West Bank schools for more than four months
this academic year, saying the classrooms had become centers of
Arab unrest.
   The loss of studies angered Palestinians, who held underground
classes during some of the closings.
   In east Jerusalem, Arab children hurled rocks at passing cars on
the main commercial street of Salah Eddin across the road from the
walled Old City.
   A police van was stoned but no one was hurt, police said. The
protesters also smashed windows in an Israeli-owned bank and four
homes in east Jerusalem.
   ``There were a lot of kids. They were chanting something and
threw many stones. I was a little afraid,'' Ahuva Schindler of Los
Angeles, who was visiting one of the four homes, said on Israel
radio.
   Youths also blocked roads in the A-Tur neighborhood on the Mount
of Olives and smashed windows in a restaurant in a tourist district.
   The protesters were dispersed by police on horseback and riot
control troops wielding nightsticks. Troops trying to clear
protesters from the central bus station in Arab east Jerusalem
overturned food stands, the radio said.
   Jerusalem Police Chief Yosef Yehudia said 48 demonstrators were
arrested. He called the protests ``a spontaneous eruption of
emotions over the end of the school year.''
   In Nablus, north of Jerusalem, Maher Abu Ghazaleh, 22, and
Hussam Abdel Aziz, 23, were shot and killed as hundreds of students
marched in the casbah, or Arab marketplace, hospital officials and
Arab witnesses said.
   The students chanted anti-Israeli slogans as they raised banned
Palestinian flags and pictures of Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The Nablus clashes occurred a day after three West Bank
residents were killed and at least six others wounded in clashes
with troops. It was the highest death toll in the anti-Israeli
revolt in two months.
   Similar protests also were reported today in Ramallah and
Hebron, where Arab youths burned tires and blocked roads, witnesses
said.
   The underground leadership of the uprising issued its 22nd
leaflet of directives, which praised ``our brothers inside (Israel)
who are responding to our calls and destroying the enemy's land. We
ask them to reject the occupation authorities' attempts to recruit
them to work in the West Bank.''
   Palestinian arsonists have been blamed for fires that have
scorched thousands of acres in Israel this year.

   The Democratic prize in his grasp at last,
Michael Dukakis readied the convention speech today that he hopes
will ``distill the essence'' of his presidential candidacy and
mobilize a united party for victory this fall against Republican
George Bush.
   The 54-year-old Massachusetts governor formally claims the
nomination tonight with a nationally televised acceptance speech
concluding the most harmonious party convention in more than a
decade.
   ``It's all a little bit like a play,'' said Dukakis, his face
breaking into a smile the moment California's delegates gave him
the roll call majority that assured his triumph Wednesday night
over Jesse Jackson.
   ``I feel terrific,'' the nominee said.
   Dukakis visited the convention hall early today for a second
look at the podium. Accompanied by aides, he asked numerous
questions about the setup and took notes with paper and pen.
   He cleared the rest of his schedule today to give himself plenty
of time to apply his personal finishing touches to one of the most
important speeches of his political career.
   ``For much of the public that will be watching this speech, it
will be the first serious look at who Michael Dukakis is and where
he wants to take this country,'' said Christopher Edley, the
campaign's issues director. ``So an effort to distill the essence
of the candidacy is perfectly appropriate.''
   Dukakis watched the climactic roll call on television from his
hotel suite a few blocks from The Omni convention hall in downtown
Atlanta. He was surrounded by his mother Euterpe, his wife Kitty
and their children Kara, Andrea and John, as well as top aides and
friends.
   ``Cheers,'' they shouted, raising champagne glasses to celebrate.
   Dukakis allowed himself little display of emotion. He smiled,
jabbed the air with his right fist and lifted his glass to toast
the end of a long and tumultuous contest.
   Dukakis worked on his speech Wednesday after meeting briefly
with Jackson, his former rival, to discuss the fall campaign.
Dukakis sat in an easy chair in the bedroom of his hotel suite
revising a draft of his speech with a pen.
   ``Good, good,'' was all he would say in describing progress on
the speech that his aides said already had been through three major
rewrites.
   The aides said Dukakis planned no major surprises in his speech,
but would stick to the basic themes he had laid out during the
primaries.
   Edley said Dukakis would focus mainly on ``economic opportunity
and security'' for Americans through affordable housing, quality
education, health care and advance notice of plant closings to
workers losing their jobs.
   He also planned to demand a redirection of U.S. foreign policy
in such regions as Central America and South Africa.
   Dukakis has strongly criticized administration-backed U.S. aid
to the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua as well as the
administration's dealings with the South African government, which
he says has engaged in terrorist acts.
   His aides said Dukakis would not try to elicit the kind of
emotion that Jackson arouses with his fervent oratory, but would
seek to display the consistency of the message he has delivered
throughout his campaign for the nomination.
   ``The message doesn't change from week to week; the themes don't
change from week to week,'' Edley said. ``There's a steadiness to
what this campaign is about, and a line of continuity from his
announcement speech straight through to the inaugural address.''
   Edley said the Dukakis speech, like Jackson's on Tuesday night,
would be ``kind of a greatest hits'' collection from his earlier
campaign speeches.
   ``We're going to let Dukakis be Dukakis,'' Edley said.
   He will criticize the Republicans for ``romantic attachment to
the status quo in both domestic and foreign policy,'' Edley said.
   But the speech is not planned as stridently partisan.
   ``It will be a positive speech,'' Edley said. ``There is not
going to be a harsh, partisan edge to it. That is not the Dukakis
style.''

<HEAD>NTSB Releases Documents On Co-Pilot's Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-pilot thought to have been at the
controls of a commuter plane that crashed Feb. 19, killing 12
people, had been ``all over the sky'' in training flights, a
veteran pilot has told federal investigators.
   Kathy Digan ``didn't have a feel for the airplane,'' Robert
Haller said in a March interview with the National Transportation
Safety Board. ``Her landings were interesting to say the least.
Twice she almost put us in the weeds.''
   According to documents released Wednesday by the NTSB, Digan was
believed to be flying the twin-engine plane because pilot Walter
Cole acknowledged an air traffic controller's clearance to take off
on the night of the crash that killed everyone aboard.
   The pilot using the radio customarily would not be at the
controls, the safety board said.
   Moments after takeoff in heavy fog from Raleigh-Durham
International Airport, the Richmond, Va.-bound American Eagle Metro
III plane crashed into the shore of a reservoir, 3,000 feet from
the airport's 10,000-foot runway.
   A. Barry Strauch, the NTSB's chief investigator, said Ms.
Digan's problems did not necessarily mean she caused the crash. In
a telephone interview from Washington, Strauch told The News and
Observer of Raleigh the agency hadn't determined the cause.
   The NTSB has said Ms. Digan had spotty training records but was
qualified to fly the plane on the night of the crash.
   Although no mechanical failure has been found in the plane's
engines or propellers, Strauch said other mechanical components are
still being tested.
   In two documents, Haller, an American Eagle pilot, described
problems he noticed in training flights with Ms. Digan in September
1987. ``She didn't know where she was in relation to the airport,''
he said. ``She was all over the sky.''
   In a Sept. 15 evaluation report, Haller noted Ms. Digan's
deficiencies in flying a Metro III: ``She is way behind the
airplane, has not developed a feel for the airplane, is having a
hard time handling the speed, has a tendency to over control and
she has real (underlined) problems landing.
   ``Made two decent landings in full-month,'' Haller wrote. ``Her
flying was not improving during the month. She continued to make
the same mistakes.''
   Haller discussed Ms. Digan's problems with other airline
officials, the documents said. One told him that Ms. Digan's mother
was seriously ill and that her ability would improve once she got
over family problems.
   Haller, who now works for Eastern Airlines, stated in March that
the last comments he heard regarding Ms. Digan indicated she was
improving.
   In September, Haller and Billie Minix, an American Eagle
employee designated by the Federal Aviation Administration to check
pilot qualifications, agreed Ms. Digan was not qualified to fly the
Metro III.
   Earlier, in July, Minix had recommended firing Ms. Digan after
she failed two landing tests while trying to qualify on a Metro II,
a predecessor of the Metro III with slightly shorter wings and less
powerful engines.
   Documents released Wednesday also include sworn statements from
a top FAA official that Ms. Digan was not qualified to make a
takeoff on the night of the crash.
   The documents also include statements from AVAir, which operated
American Eagle, and FAA officials saying the pilots met
requirements. AVAir's lawyer, William F. Womble Jr., also said the
pilots met training requirements.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Geoffrey Bourne, an internationally known
nutritionist and medical researcher who wrote an important
historical overview of hunger in Europe during wartime, has died.
He was 79 years old.
   Bourne, who was vice-chancellor of the St. George's University
School of Medicine on the Caribbean island of Grenada, died Tuesday
at Bellevue Hospital's coronary care unit, where he was admitted
two weeks ago, a spokesman for the university said.
   The Australian native was the author of several books, including
`Nutrition and the War'' (1941) and ``Starvation in Europe''
(1943). The latter book was placed in the British Imperial War
Museum as a historical document.
   Bourne also founded and edited the World Review of Nutrition and
Dietetics and the International Review of Cytology.
   He earned bachelor's, master's and doctor's degrees from the
University of Western Australia, and another doctoral degree from
Oxford University.
   From 1938 to 1947, Bourne taught physiology at Oxford. During
World War II, he also served as a member of the British Special
Operations Executive in charge of biomedical research for Special
Forces in Southeast Asia with the rank of major.
   In 1945-1946, he was chairman of the Pan Malayan Nutrition
Council, which assessed Malaya's food needs after the Japanese
surrender.
   Between 1948 and 1957, Bourne was professor of histology at the
University of London. He later became professor and chairman of
anatomy at Emory University Medical School in Atlanta.
   In 1962, he became director of the Yerkes Primate Research
Center at Emory, a post he held until joining the St. George's
University School of Medicine in 1977 as vice-chancellor. He was
also a professor of nutrition at St. George's, and was in charge of
scores of American medical students trapped in Grenada before the
U.S. invasion in October 1983.
   Bourne was a fellow of the Institute of Biology in England, the
Zoological Society of London and the American Society of
Gerontology. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine for
more than half a century.
   Funeral services for Bourne were to be held in Atlanta and a
memorial service was to be held in Grenada.

maintain friendly ties with Israel.
   ``America is a very large country.... and what will matter is
the administration's policy and the majority of the American public

nothing will change and relations between Israel and the United
States will continue to be those of allies, like today.''
   Shamir has pledged not to get involved in internal U.S.

   _The Times of London (independent) said in an editorial today:
   ``Gov. Michael Dukakis has proved that he is a highly successful
campaign chief executive. He now has to prove that he can campaign.
   ``He can raise money _ far more than his rivals. He showed
himself sufficiently able in matters of policy to survive the early
loss of his principal adviser. His tough, not to say brutal,
treatment of the Rev. Jesse Jackson has insured against one of the
easiest jibes aimed by Republicans at Democratic leaders: that they
are weak under pressure.
   ``He can learn from past mistakes. It is plain that the chief
errors made by the Democrats in the last two presidential races
will not be repeated. Above all, the link to narrow but vocal
single-interest campaigns has been broken.
   ``The inclusion of Mr. Jackson as a third force behind the
ticket has been done without apparent cost in terms of unacceptable
policies. The convention declined to support Mr. Jackson's calls
for increased taxes on the wealthy or an undertaking on
no-first-use of nuclear weapons.
   ``The Democratic platform this year is, for the first time in
many campaigns, not a liability to the candidate.''

<TEXT>
   _Le Figaro (conservative) on Dukakis: ``Certainly his lack of
humor, his mechanical elocution, his technocratic vocabulary, his
stormy character _ he's said to have fragile nerves _ are not in
his favor. But he compensates for these faults with a serious
nature and a sense of organization without fail. And his
Mediterranean charm, drawn from contained passion, pleases women!
   ``The result is that the party is more united than it has ever
been. Does the credit go to Mike Dukakis himself? To the choice of
a southern conservative, Lloyd Bentson, as running mate? To the
support of Jesse Jackson? To all of these elements put together?
Opinions, as always, are split.''

   _Liberation (leftist) on the Democratic platform: ``Dukakis will
go into combat in November without being weighed down by specific
promises or excessive engagements. Tuesday, the convention approved
the shortest and most neutral Democratic platform in history. Five
thousand words of generalities and platitudes, overcoming easily
Jackson's more robust propositions. Like a steamroller, the Dukakis
camp eliminated the black reverend's views on the use of nuclear
weapons, taxes on the rich or the Middle East.''

   _Milan's Corriere della Sera (moderate) on the convention:
   ``The three great television channels had to close down
transmission at 11 at night, but when Jackson started to speak all
timetables were ignored, and the tyranny of programming and
publicity was for once shattered. Those who direct great shows know
how to recognize one when they see it. Or maybe, after all, it
turns out that it is not true that we are in the era of passionless
politics, one empty of values, preset by experts, determined by the
polls, articulated by professional speechwriters, and sold like a
detergent.''

<TEXT>
   _Rome's Il Messaggero (moderate): ``The hearts of many delegates
are with Jackson who in his sermon dragged out both laughter and
tears from the public, raising emotions with a speech about hope
destined to remain in history as a follow up to the memorable
statement by Martin Luther King Jr., `I have a dream.'''

   _Kurier, Austria's second largest circulation daily, marked
Dukakis' nomination with a profile of the man it called ``a doer
knocking on the White House door ... the new fast climber of U.S.
politics.''
   Kurier noted that Dukakis' program to date is ``short, not
dangerous and politically vague,'' but said that ``in one essential
point, he is different from other politicians: he keeps political
promises, but tries in advance to avoid them.''
   Describing Dukakis' lifestyle, the paper noted that he has very
few close friends, but that ``elegance and some eccentricity are
provided by his wife Kitty, the daughter of a well-known Boston
musician of Jewish religion.''

   _The conservative Vienna daily Die Presse said in a news story
that although Dukakis won out in the campaign, ``the black preacher
Jesse Jackson dominated the scene.''
   In a feature, the paper stressed Jimmy Carter's comeback among a
general overview that presented the catchword ``Let's party'' _ at
the cost of several million dollars _ as the essence of the
convention.

   _The conservative Svenska Dagbladet newspaper published a column
saying that if Swedes were voting for the U.S. president, Dukakis
would win easily, but that he will lose because he is not a Swede.
   Ingemar Dorfer, a researcher on political and security affairs
at the Defense Research Institute, wrote: ``Dukakis would naturally
win in Sweden. He is liberal, he is a representative of the
professional trades, just like the Swedish journalists covering his
campaign. America has a natural Democratic majority.
   ``Wrong. It's only the Swedish state of Minnesota that voted
Democratic in four of the five latest presidential elections. While
the House of Representatives, now and nearly always, has a
Democratic majority, the position of president has as a rule a
Republican one.
   ``Ideology is not going to decide the election. The majority of
people are now against state intervention in their lives. That goes
especially for emigrants from Asia and Latin America who, in their
old homelands, saw authorities as enemies.''

<HEAD>North Was Target Of Potential Assassination Plot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North was the target of a potential
assassination plot that involved one of eight men charged with
illegal pro-Libyan activities in the United States, an
administration source says.
   The man, Mousa Hawamda, is a naturalized American who was
identified Wednesday at an arraignment hearing for six of those
arrested in the alleged scheme, which prosecutors said involved
diversion of Libyan funds to support anti-American activities.
   Hawamda was described as a Libyan intelligence operative who
operates under the guise of a Washington travel agency owner.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said that based on information
received by the FBI, Hawamda ``was involved in a potential plot to
assassinate a high government official of the United States.''
Hudson did not identify the official or give any other details.
   But another official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the target was North, a former National Security
Council aide and a major player in the Iran-Contra arms and money
scandal.
   North, who was fired from his NSC post in November 1986 over
allegations that he illegally funneled money to the Contra rebels
in Nicaragua, masterminded counterterrorism operations against
Libya, including the April 1986 aerial bombing of Tripoli.
   During the congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair,
North said threats against his life had prompted him to install a
security fence around his home.
   The eight who were arrested Wednesday by the FBI were brought
before judges and ordered held without bail pending detention
hearings later this week. Six of the men appeared before a U.S.
magistrate in nearby Alexandria, Va., and were then led out with
their hands and legs shackled; another one was being held in
Detroit; the eighth was picked up in Denver.
   Hudson said defendant Saleh Mohamed Guima Al-Rajhi, 32, had
given the Libyan government a list of U.S. officials who may have
been involved in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya. The prosecutor
said this was done for the purpose of retaliation by Libya.
   ``This is a rare case, a sensitive case involving national
security,'' Hudson told the magistrate. He said the prosecution had
obtained much of the information leading to the arrests from
informants whose lives were in danger.
   ``Our intention is to try and protect them as long as
possible,'' Hudson said.
   Six of the eight arrested were described as members of the
People's Committee for Libyan Students, based in McLean, Va. The
other two were the owner of the Manara Travel Agency and an agent
for the company, according to the FBI.
   All were charged with violating a license allowing the student
organization to provide financial support for Libyan students in
the United State and Canada.
   The prosecution alleged that the organization diverted funds to
pay for some 200 Americans, among them Black Muslims and Indians,
to travel to Libya for anti-American demonstrations.
   The violations carry a possible penalty of five years
imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine.
   Travel to Libya is prohibited by U.S. sanctions imposed on that
country in 1981 and 1986 because of its alleged involvement in
international terrorism. However, the United States allowed the
Libyan organization to open an office here in 1986 in order to
provide financial support for some 200 Libyan students in the
country.
   In affidavits presented to the court, the prosecution said
Hawamda's Manara Travel Agency in downtown Washington was begun
with $35,000 provided by Libyan intelligence. The agency supplied
false billing information to the student organization to hide the
real use of the money, according to the documents.
   The other defendants are: the student committee's chairman,
Milad Shibani, 34; former chairman Salem Omar Zubeidy, 39, a
graduate student at the University of Michigan; Mahdi Mohammad
Abousetta, 35; Ramadan Taher Belgasem, 33; Adel Ali Sennosi, 30;
and Manhal Ben Mohamed, 23, a travel agent working for Hawamda.
   All the organization members told the magistrate they were
registered as full-time students in masters or doctoral programs.

   There'll be four Lloyd Bentsens at the Democratic
National Convention tonight. One of them will leave as the vice
presidential nominee. The others, no doubt, will be applauding
loudly.
   Tonight will be a family affair as spectators include the Texas
senator's 94-year-old father, Lloyd Bentsen; son, Lloyd Bentsen
III; and grandson, Lloyd Bentsen IV.
   The nominee won't be hard to find. He's the tall, smooth-talking
senator who has made the rounds this week receiving praise from
civil rights and women's groups, winning over some skeptical
delegates and trading accolades with Jesse Jackson and Michael
Dukakis.
   And tonight, as he accepts his party's nomination, Bentsen
apparently will continue to aim to please. He says he intends to
highlight similarities he has with the more liberal Dukakis, not
differences.
   ``I'm going to talk about jobs, education, health care and
growth,'' the 67-year-old senator told reporters Wednesday.
   Bentsen took more than an hour to practice his speech Wednesday
in a room backstage at The Omni convention center, joined by his
wife Beryl Ann, known as B.A. He returned to the hall today to
check out the podium from which he'll give the address.
   He has chosen Illinois Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, a friend from
Capitol Hill, to nominate him and he will be introduced by Sen.
John Glenn of Ohio, who was also considered by Dukakis as a
possible running mate.
   On Wednesday, Bentsen took time out from speech preparation to
pay tribute to women's groups and court their support for November.
   Ann Richards, who delivered the keynote speech to the Democratic
convention Monday night, gave Bentsen a rousing introduction at one
appearance, calling him ``a friend to women'' and hailing his
effort to help female Democratic candidates.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen's name is absolute magic in the state of Texas,
and I believe in this coming election it's going to be magic for
the Democratic ticket,'' she said. She called Bentsen a mentor and
``one of the reasons I serve as treasurer of Texas.''
   Bentsen said Dukakis ``has a great record on issues involving
women.''
   Several women in the group stood and shouted ``No Contra aid''
as Bentsen, a supporter of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, left the
room.
   Contra aid is just one of the foreign policy issues on which
Bentsen and Dukakis disagree. But Ms. Richards called the ticket a
balanced one and added: ``I think he gives us a real shot at this
election in November.''
   On Friday, Bentsen will get a chance to demonstrate his value to
the ticket in Texas, going with Dukakis to Houston for a rally.
While there, Bentsen also will receive an award for efforts to
clean up Galveston Bay.
   The candidates will fly to California and then swing back East
over the weekend.

   About 300 radical students demanding
the arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan on corruption charges
clashed with riot police in the South Korean capital today.
   The students, who came from various schools in the capital,
marched into the streets after a rally at the Hongik University
shouting, ``Punish Chun Doo-hwan!''
   Riot police fired tear gas, touching off a fierce battle with
the students who countered with firebombs and rocks. There were no
injuries or arrests reported in the clash, which lasted about an
hour.
   In a prepared statement, the students criticized the government
of President Roh Tae-woo for trying to protect the ex-president,
who they said ``stood at the forefront of all corruption and
irregularities.''
   During the rally, the students burned effigies of Roh and Chun
and shouted that they would fight until their demands were met.
   It was one of the few anti-government student protests reported
in recent weeks. All universities are on summer vacation until the
end of August.
   Chun, whose term ended in February, has come under fire for
alleged involvement in financial and other scandals. One of his
brothers is on trial for allegedly embezzling millions of dollars
in official funds.
   Roh replaced Chun after December elections. He was Chun's choice
as a successor.

<HEAD>Dallas' Highest-Ranking Hispanic Official Fired Over Alleged
Embezzlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant City Manager Samuel Moreno, Dallas'
highest-ranking Hispanic employee, has been fired in the wake of a
judge's ruling that he defrauded his company before it sought
bankruptcy protection in 1983.
   City Manager Richard Knight told City Council members Wednesday
he had ``no choice'' but to fire Moreno, a move criticized by some
Hispanic leaders. He said the matter had cast ``a shadow'' over the
city's integrity.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abrahamson ordered Moreno to repay
$131,164 he said was obtained through embezzlement and fraud from
Moreno's former oil-field supply company, Petroleum Energy
Equipment Co.
   Abrahamson on May 25 also ruled that Moreno, who at one point
had about $2.5 million in personal and corporate debts, improperly
altered corporate records and took out illegal loans.
   Knight said he learned of Abrahamson's ruling Tuesday.
   Moreno, 60, hired as one of four assistant city managers in
1986, declined to comment on his firing by Knight.
   ``He's sits in the hot seat,'' Moreno said. ``I'm not going to
second-guess his decision.''
   Moreno oversaw the Dallas Convention Center and Reunion Arena,
international affairs, the Fire Department, the public library
system, Love Field and Redbird Airport. His annual salary was
$78,417.
   Marcos Ronquillo, president of the Dallas Hispanic Chamber of
Commerce and a lawyer, characterized the firing as premature and
said Knight should have considered suspending Moreno or placing him
on leave.
   ``The guy's had his problems, but I don't know that they relate
this to his performance on the job,'' said Joe May, a member of the
mayor's Hispanic Task Force.

<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former head of the
Cambodian resistance movement, said today he will go to Indonesia
this weekend but will not participate in informal talks on
achieving peace in Cambodia.
   ``How could they be a success?'' Sihanouk said to reporters
after meeting with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.
   Sihanouk, a former Cambodian head of state, resigned this month
from the presidency of the three-party guerrilla coalition that is
fighting Vietnamese troops occupying Cambodia. He appointed his
son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, to represent him at the talks, which
start Monday in the resort city of Bogor, 37 miles south of Jakarta.
   The meetings, the first to include all parties to the
long-running Cambodian conflict, are being called ``cocktail
party'' talks because they will be informal discussions rather than
negotiations. Participating will be the guerrilla coalition, the
government in Phnom Penh and Vietnam.
   Sihanouk said two factors are working against the talks: what he
called ``fundamental contradictions'' between Khmer Rouge forces
allied with China and the government in Phnom Penh, and what he
said was Vietnam's refusal to discuss Cambodia's real problems.
   But he said he had accepted an invitation from Indonesian
President Suharto to come to Jakarta in the hope that he could
``contribute to the success'' of the talks.
   Sihanouk headed a resistance coalition that grouped his own
forces, the Khmer Rouge and a non-communist group headed by former
Son Sann.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people during
its bloody rule from 1975-79. Vietnam drove the Khmer Rouge from
power and set up a pro-Hanoi government.
   The Vietnamese have said they will withdraw their troops by
1990, or possibly earlier if there is a political settlement.

   Eleven rebels and seven civilians were
killed this week in three rebel attacks that violated the leftist
Sandinista government's unilateral cease-fire, the Defense Ministry
said.
   Also Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry requested a U.S. visa for
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann, whom the Reagan administration
expelled last week.
   The Defense Ministry statement said a Contra rebel band ambushed
two vehicles on Tuesday near Juigalpa, 55 miles east of Managua,
killing seven civilians, including two children aged 7 and 9.
   Five civilians were wounded in the attack, it said.
   Nine rebels were killed Monday when Sandinista troops fought off
an attack near Muelle de los Bueyes and Muhan, neighboring villages
in southern Nicaragua near the Caribbean coast, the ministry said.
   It did not mention any government casualties.
   Two more rebels were killed and one wounded in a Tuesday attack
on troops near San Rafael del Norte, 110 miles north of the
capital, the ministry said. It said the troops repelled the attack
by the U.S.-supported rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega announced Tuesday that the government
was unilaterally extending to Aug. 30 its cease-fire with the
Contas.
   Each side in the 7-year-old war has accused the other of
violating the truce, which began when a preliminary peace accord
was signed March 23, a month after Congress voted against renewed
military aid for the Contras.
   Negotiations for a lasting peace broke down June 9.
   State-run Voice of Nicaragua radio said Tunnermann needs to
travel to the United States to take part in an international
education contest and functions related to his job as ambassador to
the Organization of American States.
   U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment Wednesday night.
   The United States on July 11 ordered Tunnermann and seven other
Nicaraguan diplomats to leave to retaliate for Nicaragua's
expulsion of eight American diplomats, including Ambassador Richard
Melton.
   The Sandinistas said Melton and the others were implementing a
U.S. plan to incite domestic unrest.

   A man accused of a bombing outside a
nuclear weapons laboratory Nov. 28 will be confined to a mental
hosital for 18 months in a deal with prosecutors under which
criminal charges will be dropped.
   The agreement concluded Wednesday with Stephen Dwyer, 40, of
Palm Desert, was reached a day after U.S. District Judge Marilyn
Hall Patel criticized the government's handling of an immunity
agreement with him.
   ``We felt it was in the government's interest and the public's
interest to secure his commitment to some facility rather than risk
the outright dismissal of the case and his release,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Levin.
   Dwyer was charged with setting off a dynamite bomb next to the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, a facility 40 miles east of San
Francisco where U.S. nuclear weapons are designed. He could have
received up to 40 years in prison.
   The bomb demolished a laboratory employee's car, damaged three
other cars, broke dozens of windows and scattered debris for 400
yards.
   Dwyer was charged with interstate transport of explosives,
making and possessing a bomb and damaging federal property.
   ``From the standpoint of my client, he's going to be getting
some medical help that I think he needs,'' said Public Defender
Barry Portman. ``There's no getting around what he did. This isn't
a person with all his wits about him.''
   The FBI said Dwyer, a miner, bought materials for the bomb at a
shop in Reno, Nev.
   Dwyer's lawyers had contended the charges were based on evidence
provided by Dwyer under a promise of immunity. Prosecutors said the
agreement was not binding because Dwyer lied about a bomb at a
nuclear facility in the Los Angeles area.
   The agreement was not written down because of the apparent
urgency of the situation, said J. Stephen Czuleger, the federal
prosecutor who handled the case in Los Angeles.
   Patel on Tuesday said she was unsatisfied with the ``cursory,
casual way'' the government had handled the immunity agreement.

<HEAD>Three Presumed Dead As Salvadoran Cargo Plane Crashes Into Swamps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A search resumed today for three crewmen
aboard a Salvadoran cargo plane that ran low on fuel and crashed in
Louisiana swamps near the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard said.
   Thirty to 35 people searched along a canal where the chartered,
four-engine DC-6 went down Wednesday night, said a Lafourche Parish
sheriff's dispatcher who would not identify himself.
   ``There apparently were no survivors, but you never know,''
Sheriff Duffy Breaux said Wednesday.
   The TACA International Airlines charter was on a five-hour
flight from San Salvador, El Salvador, to New Orleans with 22,000
pounds of handicrafts, seafood, plants, electronics and other
cargo, said Gary Mascaro, TACA cargo manager at New Orleans
International Airport.
   It was the second time in two months that a TACA flight was
forced down short of the airport.
   An FAA controller who asked not to be identified said the
plane's pilot reported at 7:20 p.m. Wednesday that he had just 15
minutes of fuel remaining, that he would be unable to reach New
Orleans and had to find a closer airfield.
   The nearest field, north of Grand Isle at Fouchon, had a
3,000-foot runway but the propeller-driven DC-6 needed 5,000 feet
and its pilot decided to ditch, the FAA spokesman said.
   The plane hit a levee and crashed in a drainage canal about 300
to 400 yards west of Louisiana Highway 1, about 40 miles south of
New Orleans, Breaux said. The area is surrounded by swamps and
marshes, accessible only by boat and helicopter.
   ``We didn't see any survivors and it's a pretty deep canal with
about 15 feet of water,'' Breaux said. ``The plane was submerged,
with only its wings still sticking up.''
   The Coast Guard sent a jet plane, a helicopter and boats to the
scene, Lt. Bruce Campbell said at the Coast Guard's 8th District
headquarters in New Orleans.
   ``They found a great deal of wreckage just alongside Bayou
Lafourche, right alongside a roadway. He (the pilot) may have tried
to land on the roadway and slid off,'' Campbell said.
   TACA is a Central American airline, based in El Salvador, with
offices in New Orleans. TACA operates two round-trip cargo flights
weekly between San Salvador and New Orleans, and rents planes from
other companies when there is a lot of cargo to haul, Mascaro said.
   TACA leased the plane from Fiorella Crew Inc. of Miami and the
men aboard were Fiorella employees, Mascaro said. He said he did
not know their names and Fiorella officials could not be
immediately reached in Miami.
   On May 24, a TACA jet flight with 41 people aboard experienced
engine trouble during a a violent thunderstorm and its pilot made
an emergency landing on a grassy strip of land in swampy eastern
New Orleans. No one was injured.

<HEAD>Shuttle Motor Mistake Blamed On Shift Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistake that damaged a space shuttle
booster rocket intended for a crucial test firing resulted from
confusion during a shift change at Morton Thiokol's plant, a NASA
official said.
   The accident occurred July 9 when a worker testing one of the
rocket's three field joints inadvertently switched pressurization
lines and damaged insulation that helps contain superhot exhaust
gases during flight.
   The damage at Thiokol's plant west of here delayed a test-firing
of the rocket motor this month until late August, company officials
said.
   Thiokol's booster was redesigned after a presidential commission
found that a faulty joint was responsible for the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion that destroyed the space shuttle Challenger and grounded
the U.S. manned space flight program.
   The booster firing test is the last of five required on the
redesigned rocket before shuttle flights can resume.
   Royce Mitchell, director of NASA's shuttle rocket motor program,
said a replacement shift had come on duty just before the accident
and the fresh workers incorrectly believed the first crew had
checked the equipment.
   ``That little, significant piece of data was lost between the
two crews,'' Mitchell said in a telephone interview Tuesday from
the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   He said the second crew would have discovered the hoses were
improperly attached if they had checked them before the
pressurization test, one of many tests in preparation for a
test-firing.
   He said that after the accident company workers and NASA
officials inspected the motor and found that a seal had been
deformed when the hose sent 950 pounds per square inch of pressure
into the joint instead of the intended 100 psi.
   The joint was repaired and the rocket is being reassembled for
the test firing.

<TEXT>
   A former nuclear engineer with Westinghouse
Electric Corp. says he was fired for raising safety concerns at a
Georgia nuclear plant, but the company says he was dismissed for
punching a supervisor.
   In a lawsuit against Westinghouse, Terry Dysert said the
Pittsburgh-based company fabricated the assault charge to justify
his dismissal.
   He said he actually was fired for complaining about faults in a
safety system at the Vogtle Power Station near Augusta, Ga., that
could prevent control room operators from recognizing problems in
the reactor's core.
   ``A worst-case scenario would be what happened at Three Mile
Island,'' Dysert, 39, formerly of Pittsburgh and now of Coconut
Grove, Fla., said Wednesday.
   Westinghouse spokesman Bob Henderson said Georgia Power Co.,
which built the plant, investigated Dysert's complaints and ``the
matter was resolved to the satisfaction of Georgia Power, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and even of Dysert.''
   Westinghouse, which designed the Georgia plant, denied there
were any problems of the sort he alleged.
   ``The employee's dismissal was totally unrelated to the safety
concerns he had raised,'' Henderson said. ``Westinghouse employees
are encouraged to express safety concerns and may do so without
fear of intimidation or harassment.''
   Labor Department Area Director John O'Brien, while acknowledging
that Dysert ``was not a diplomat'' about the matter, concluded
earlier that Dysert's safety complaints ``ruffled feathers and ...
ultimately led to his termination.''
   O'Brien noted that Westinghouse had previously disregarded the
alleged assault.
   However, Administrative Law Judge George Pierce, to whom
Westinghouse appealed, rejected Dysert's claim to be a protected
whistleblower under the law and said he was fired for the alleged
assault, not for raising safety concerns.
   In his suit, filed Friday in state court in Philadelphia, Dysert
contends he was fired in July 1986 for complaining about the
adequacy of tests performed on a monitoring system in the Unit 1
reactor at Vogtle, which went on line in June 1987 after more than
15 years of controversy over cost and safety.
   The instruments monitor water levels in the primary cooling
system, critical to the reactor's safe operation.
   Dysert said he found three problems _ a leak in the emergency
cooling system, oil in the system and faulty electronic equipment
gauging water levels _ which he said his supervisor ignored.
   ``There is the potential that if the system was used alone the
plant operators would be led to make a wrong decision. They may
decide there's no problem at all,'' he said.
   Dysert said his supervisor transferred him when he asked to have
the tests rerun. He was later fired, accused of having assaulted
his team leader in the parking lot of a Georgia motel after work.

   A bomb believed set by militant Tamils
killed four people in northeast Sri Lanka today, and enraged
villagers then hacked at least three Tamils to death, military
officials and residents said.
   The bomb exploded in a shop in Trincomalee owned by Sinhalese.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by
the majority Buddhist Sinhalese.
   Military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity under
briefing rules, said at least four people in the shop were killed
in the blast.
   At least 12 others were injured in the blast, they said.
   According to officials, the explosion was caused by Tamil
radicals campaigning for an independent homeland in the north and
east of Sri Lanka.
   Tamil residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Sinhalese, angered by the explosion, then hacked three Tamils to
death in the area.
   Military officials could not confirm the Tamil deaths.

   Americans will continue to have longer feet
than the rest of the world. At least a longer foot, the unit of
measurement.
   Two federal agencies have decided to keep the uniquely American
standard of measurement for the foot, which is something less than
a hair longer than the international foot.
   The National Bureau of Standards and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration are asking for comment, as required by
law, on their proposal to reject a plan first contemplated in 1959
to eventually adopt the international standard of 0.3048 of a meter
to define the foot.
   Instead, the agencies propose to continue indefinitely use of
the ``U.S. Survey Foot,'' which is defined as 1200@3937ths of a
meter.
   That's less than a millionth of an inch longer.
   Announcement of the proposal, which becomes official only after
anyone affected has a chance to comment, was in the Tuesday edition
of the Federal Register.

   Iran's parliament speaker, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said today he wept listening to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini say that Iran would accept a U.N. cease-fire resolution,
Tehran Radio reported.
   Rafsanjani also told Iranians not to question the decision.
   ``We should not ask why and how, not create more problems for
the society,'' Rafsanjani, who is also commander of the armed
forces, said in parliament.
   A U.N. team will visit Iran and Iraq this week to try to work
out details of implementing the resolution.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, also said that four more bodies
from the Iran Air jetliner shot down by a U.S. missile July 3 had
been recovered. The bodies, all male, were found near the southern
coastal city of Bandar-Lengeh, about 120 miles from the area of the
southern Persian Gulf where the plane went down, it said.
   The bodies of 186 of the 290 people on board have been
recovered. The Navy said troops mistook the plane for an F-14
fighter and shot it down.
   The radio report said Iran obtained the equipment needed to
search for the flight recorder and would begin hunting for it soon.
   U.S. officials have said they hope the recorder will reveal
whether the civilian pilot monitored warnings from the missile
cruiser USS Vincennes.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Iraq shelled the
village of Sardasht in northern Azerbaijan province along the
Soviet border and killed one civilian and injured two.
   On Wednesday, Khomeini said he accepted the advice of other
Iranian leaders and agreed to a U.N. resolution calling for a
cease-fire in the war between the Persian Gulf neighbors that began
in September 1980.
   Rafsanjani said Iranians could take stock of the reason for
accepting U.N. Resolution 598 some time in the future, and that
they would accept the fact that Khomeini changed his mind.
   Until this week, Khomeini had been adamant in opposing an end to
the war and vowed to continue until President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq was driven from power.
   Rafsanjani repeated that Iran will continue to man the
warfronts, and Mohsen Rezai, commander in chief of the
Revolutionary Guard corps, said the same in an interview today.
   ``If any change occurs in the resolution, we will stand against
it and will respond to any aggression,'' Rezai said.
   Khomeini, in his statement, stressed how difficult it was for
him to accept the resolution.
   ``I shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more
deadly to me than poison, but I am happy to submit to God's will
and drank this cup for his satisfaction,'' the 87-year-old
revolutionary patriarch said Wednesday.
   Although the statement said he could not immediately reveal the
reasons for changing his mind, it said he acted on the
recommendation of military and political leaders. Khomeini's
statement was his first since the government said Monday it would
accept the cease-fire resolution.
   Iran's acceptance of U.N. Resolution 598 does not mean the war
is over, Khomeini said, but he said the decision was not just a
tactic to allow the Iranian military to regroup. Iraq has made that
accusation.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III will rule on the
proposed joint operating agreement between Detroit's major daily
newspapers before leaving office next month, a Justice Department
spokesman said.
   ``Mr. Meese will be out of office by mid-August, by the 15th,
and ... he does intend to make a decision on the Detroit JOA case
before he leaves,'' Patrick Korten said Wednesday in an interview
in Washington.
   When Meese announced July 5 that he would resign, it was
uncertain whether he would issue a ruling on the request by the
Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News, or leave it to his
successor, Korten said.
   Under the JOA, the newspapers would merge their business,
circulation and advertising operations, while keeping separate

   Dave Barry, the Miami Herald's humor columnist,
decided to see how long it took to become the subject of the news
media's attention at the Democratic National Convention. So he put
a box on his head.
   Within seconds, a photographer snapped a picture of Barry and
two other newspaper columnists who had decided to found ``People
With Boxes On Their Heads.''
   Barry said he created his group to find out how desperate for
color stories the press corps had become at a convention that
lacked surprises in the main political events.
   He writes in today's editions that he got the idea after seeing
reporters surround a woman who simply wandered by carrying her pet
rat.
   ``I enlisted Bob Morris and Erik Lacitis, who are also newspaper
columnists and therefore, like myself, do not have even a tiny
shred of human dignity, and we went out to the Protest Zone and put
cardboard boxes on our heads. It took seven seconds for the first
newspaper photographer take our picture,'' he wrote.
   He said he knew interviews got into at least two Georgia
newspapers and The Baltimore Sun, ``and a nice write-up about the
rally went out nationwide on The Associated Press wire. You might
have seen it, if you've been reading any of the news reports
emanating from this convention. Which I doubt.''
   Barry's column confirmed suspicions the AP writer had advanced
in his story: That the Guy With A Box On His Head giving the
interview was himself a journalist, perhaps a ``journalist who had
been in the sun too long.''

<NOTE>EDS: INSERTS new grafs 4-7 to update with no vice presidential

<TEXT>
   The 1988 presidential contest is over for Jesse
Jackson, but he was busy looking both forward and backward on the
day the Democrats chose Michael Dukakis as their standard bearer.
   Jackson had insisted that his name be placed in nomination
Wednesday night in what he knew was a losing cause. But once the
tally was complete, he sent his campaign chairman, California
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, to the convention hall to move for
the nomination of Dukakis by acclamation.
   ``It is appropriate tonight that the focus be on the delegates,
the vote and the nominee,'' Jackson said in a statement.
   And Jackson emphasized that he wanted the focus tonight on Lloyd
Bentsen, Dukakis' choice for vice president.
   No petitions to place Jackson's name on the vice presidential
roll call _ a move he had hinted at last week _ were submitted by
this morning's deadline.
   ``Just Mr. Bentsen's,'' said Rick Boylan, an aide in the
convention secretary's office.
   Jackson's campaign had picked up the forms to place his name in
nomination for the No. 2 spot, but they were not used. Of course,
delegates may vote for anyone they like on the roll call at
tonight's session.
   Earlier, Dukakis and Jackson had met to begin combining their
campaigns for Dukakis' race against Republican George Bush.
   Jackson and campaign aides said it was what he called a ``get
acquainted meeting'' to follow up on the unity pact he and Dukakis
reached on Monday.
   But he also spent Wednesday recalling a formative part of his
life at a luncheon with civil rights colleagues from the Southern
Christian leadership Conference. He talked about what it meant
historically to have his name placed in nomination even though he
did not win.
   Later, Jackson watched on TV in his hotel suite, surrounded by
family and a handful of friends, as he was nominated by William
Winpisinger, president of the International Association of
Machinists.
   Winpisinger, in a dramatic tribute, lauded Jackson as ``a man
who has dared sound our call to greatness.''
   ``This is a man of history, a mover and shaker in the power
struggles of freedom and tyranny, of democracy and autocracy.''
   ``Jesse, Jesse, Jesse'' the crowd chanted, then changed the
refrain to the Jackson slogan, ``Keep Hope Alive.''
   Jackson said having his name placed in nomination was ``a great
feeling personally.
   ``But really, it's my name put into nomination for the people
who voted for me, but also for the people who made it possible,''
he said.
   He said the event had triple significance.
   ``At one level it's political, because it's delegates and votes.
On another level, it's sociological because it's transforming
America in many ways. On another level, it's theological _ it's
fulfilling the prayers of people who fought hard,'' he said. ``It's
a stepping stone for progress for the future.''
   For the immediate future, Jackson plans to campaign for the
Democratic ticket with Dukakis giving him the money to do so.
   The candidates' meeting Wednesday was arranged on short notice
at Jackson's request after Dukakis called to congratulate him on
his stirring convention speech Tuesday night, aides said.
   It was ``the logical next step in implementing the
relationship,'' said a top Jackson adviser, Ann Lewis. She said the
meeting in part allowed Dukakis' top campaign staff, including Paul
Brountas and campaign manager Susan Estrich, to get to know ``the
voices on the other end of the telephone'' with whom they will be
dealing in the general election campaign.
   The plan discussed Wednesday is for Dukakis to tap into
Jackson's operation in states where Jackson ran strongly and has a
good campaign organization, she said.
   Jackson said the session was ``basically a get-acquainted
meeting for staff and key policy advisers, most of whom do not know
each other but now must work together since we are in the same boat
with a common objective _ that is, to win in November.''
   One participant, District of Columbia delegate Walter Fauntroy,
said ``things are going beautifully'' in the talks.
   Jackson also met with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Cuomo said he went to congratulate Jackson on the rousing
convention speech he delivered.
   ``He will be a continuing force in this party for a long time,''
Cuomo said.

<TEXT>
   A man who claims to be an Australian
businessman ready to pay $200 million in cash for PTL's property
has failed for the second time to meet a deadline to produce $50
million as earnest money.
   And Australians interviewed by The Charlotte Observer say that
from February until June, Gavin Morehu circulated through the
Melbourne, Australia, area proposing multimillion-dollar deals that
failed to go anywhere.
   ``That's what I think you're going to find here,'' PTL trustee
M.C. ``Red'' Benton said Wednesday. ``I really don't think he has
any substance behind his offer.''
   Benton added: ``We will not be able to spend any additional time
with him, and he's been told that ... if he comes, he must have the
money.''
   Morehu has not paid PTL more than $800 in telephone and
room-service charges from a several-day stay at the television
ministry's Heritage Grand Hotel, which he left without checking
out, Benton said. He failed Wednesday to meet a deadline to produce
$50 million toward his proposed purchase.
   Morehu, reached by the Observer on Wednesday at what is
apparently his home in Bedford, Ind., said: ``Things are looking
good and we're negotiating. We've been advised by our legal
attorneys not to comment on anything.''
   Morehu refused to answer questions about his background or about
what appear to be discrepancies in information he has given people
in the United States and Australia.
   ``Somehow you haven't got your facts right, nor have the
Australian press,'' Morehu said.
   When pressed further, he said, ``You better get the true facts,
because you don't want a $1 billion lawsuit against you. ... If you
get hard on us, we can get hard on you.''
   According to Australian news accounts and interviews with
Australians to whom Morehu has spoken, he has listed U.S. addresses
for what he says are his companies' offices, that, when checked,
were vacant.
   The company of which he claims to be president, Morehu
International, opened in April and closed in June, Australian
newspapers reported. He has claimed to own a Christian TV network
in this country that has proved to be nonexistent.
   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. said it had contacted members
of Morehu's family in Melbourne, who said he once had a small
construction business that went broke. They also said they had seen
little of him for eight years until last Christmas.
   Also on Wednesday, former PTL secretary Jessica Hahn said she
agrees with a judge's order and will return hush money paid her by
PTL for her 1980 sexual encounter with Jim Bakker that led to the
PTL founder's downfall.
   ``I feel in my heart that the money belongs in the ministry and
I hope that it will now be used properly and not for Jim Bakker's
or anyone else's personal gain,'' Ms. Hahn said in a prepared
statement.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds ruled Tuesday that PTL
should get back nearly $200,000 of the $363,700 it paid to buy Ms.
Hahn's silence.

<TEXT>
   Government troops backed by
helicopter gunships and mortar fire overran six major communist
rebel camps, killing 12 rebels, state-run television reported today.
   The attack brought to 31 the number of people killed across the
Philippines during a 24-hour period in clashes between communist
guerrillas and the army.
   The television quoted Lt. Col. Cris Maralit, spokesman of the
Philippine Constabulary, as saying the offensive occurred Wednesday
in the central province of Negros Occidental, about 310 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Maralit said the soldiers killed 12 rebels and captured 25. They
also recovered 25 high-powered rifles, 3,500 round of assorted
ammunition and about $714, he said.
   The clashes were reported three days after the communist New
People's Army rejected a call by Roman Catholic bishops for a
resumption of peace talks between the government and the rebels.
The talks broke down in February 1987.
   President Corazon Aquino appealed this month for an end to the
killings, saying they are undermining the public's confidence in
her government.
   An association of lawyers charged today that more human rights
lawyers have been killed or harassed during Mrs. Aquino's first two
years in office than in the last nine years of her deposed
predecessor's 20-year rule.
   The Free Legal Assistance Group made the accusation in a report
to a convention of human rights lawyers attended by representatives
from nine countries and the London-based human rights organization
Amnesty International.
   The group said four human rights lawyers were slain over a
nine-year period under Ferdinand Marcos, but five human rights
lawyers have been killed since Mrs. Aquino came to power in
February 1986.

<HEAD>Former Navy Intelligence Specialist Says US Targeted French
Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Navy intelligence specialist who
defected to the Soviet Union told millions of Soviet television
viewers that the United States targeted the French Embassy when it
bombed Libya in 1986.
   Glenn Michael Souther, 31, said he had access to secret
photographs used to plan the April 14, 1986 bombing attack on
Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman, Col. David Shea, said:
``Any suggestion that we would intentionally bomb an embassy is
absolutely ludicrous and not worthy of any further response.'' The
French government had no comment.
   Souther, who disappeared a month after the bombings while the
FBI was investigating him for alleged espionage, appeared Wednesday
on a one-hour, prime-time special on state-run television, ``The
Camera Looks at the World.''
   Two or three days before the raids, Souther said, he was working
in a Navy laboratory that processes satellite photographs and
learned that one target was the French Embassy. He did not say
where the laboratory was.
   ``One of the lower-ranking guys in the laboratory came up to me
and said, `Glenn, you won't believe this. We're bombing this
building and right here is the French Embassy,'' Souther said as
pictures of the American warplanes swooping toward targets came up
on the screen. He spoke in both Russian and English.
   An announcer then charged that the French Embassy was targeted
in retaliation for France's refusal to allow U.S. bombers to fly
over its territory en route to Libya.
   Foreign reporters who visited the bombed area after the raid saw
damage to the French Embassy in the Bin Ashur neighborhood of
Tripoli.
   The United States said its warplanes bombed ``terrorist-related
targets'' in Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya, and that civilian
structures were hit by mistake.
   Two days after the raid, then-Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger said the damage to the French Embassy might have been
caused by an American plane that was apparently shot down in the
raid. He said it was not because the embassy was either a target or
near a target.
   The attack was mounted to retaliate for Libya's alleged
involvement in an April 5, 1986 attack on a West Berlin discotheque
that killed an American soldier and a Turkish woman and wounded 50
people.
   The U.S. attack involved planes from two aircraft carriers off
Libya, as well as 11 warplanes which flew from England. Libya and
the Soviet Union have called the raid ``state-sponsored terrorism.''
   A Navy official in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Souther helped analyze valuable satellite
intelligence data. The official said the Pentagon was ``quite
concerned about what he might have given the Soviets.''
   Souther told a television interviewer he became disenchanted
with American foreign policy and was harassed by the FBI.
   ``I found myself having to make a decision that turned my life
around,'' Souther said. ``I had to leave my country, my family, my
buddies and close friends. My only fault was that I believed that
my own personal convictions were my rights. The FBI thought
otherwise. They followed me, I lost my future, and they restricted
my freedom.''
   The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia reported Sunday that
Souther had been granted asylum.
   Souther did not indicate whether he had spied for the Soviet
Union before leaving the United States or whether he was
cooperating now with Soviet intelligence. He did not say what his
current job was but said he was living in a comfortable Moscow
apartment.
   Souther served aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz from July
1976 to November 1978. He was assigned to the 6th Fleet command in
Naples, Italy, in April 1979.
   After an honorable discharge in October 1982, Souther worked as
an intelligence specialist at the headquarters of the 2nd Fleet
command in Norfolk, Va.
   When he left active service, he enrolled in Old Dominion
University in Norfolk, where he majored in Russian language.

   Teen-age drug abusers tend to commit more
crimes, find it harder to hold a job and do poorly in school, but
infrequent drug used appeared to do no harm to relationships,
educational achievement and mental health, according to the authors
of a federally funded study published today.
   ``Drug abusers leave school earlier, start jobs earlier, and
form families earlier,'' said Michael Newcomb, adjunct associate
professor at the University of California at Los Angeles.
   ``However, moving into adult roles without adult maturity
creates severe strains on virtually all aspects of a drug abuser's
life.''
   Newcomb and Professor Peter Bentler, both in UCLA's Department
of Psychology, put eight years of research into the study of more
than 700 teen-agers, first contacted in Los Angeles County when
they were 12 to 15 years old.
   It challenges the current emphasis on thwarting drug abuse by
challenging teen-agers to ignore peer pressure to use drugs.
   Emphasis would be better placed on ``reducing the abuse, regular
use and misuse of drugs among teen-agers,'' the authors argued.
   ``Focusing simply on handling peer pressure, such as the `just
say no' approaches, may placate concerned but naive parents,
teachers and funding sources,'' the study said, ``but is an
incomplete approach to confronting the task of preventing drug
abuse.''
   Some drug experts disputed that assertion Wednesday.
   ``It seem to me that one of the best ways to prevent people from
becoming heavy users is to reduce the number of people who are
users at all,'' said Lloyd Johnston, who heads an annual survey of
drug use among high school seniors sponsored by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse.
   Drugs studied were alcohol, marijuana, hashish, hypnotics,
cocaine, stimulants, psychedelics, inhalants, narcotics and PCP.
   Infrequent drug use _ once a month or less _ had little or no
effect on users, Newcomb said. He said teen-agers who used moderate
amounts of alcohol, but no other drugs, ``showed increased social
integration and increased self-esteem.''
   He speculated that those who used no drugs other than alcohol
may have been better adjusted than those who used other drugs.
Stressing that he was not encouraging alcohol use, Newcomb said
alcohol ``may be socially facilitative. We use it in cocktail
parties all the time.''
   Teens who abuse drugs, however, ``divorce more quickly, suffer
from greater job instability, commit more serious crimes and are
generally more unhappy in their personal lives and relationships,''
Newcomb said.

<TEXT>
   A Thai prince has come here to try to settle a
prolonged tug-of-war over an ancient relic at the Art Institute of
Chicago that Bangkok claims was illegally removed from the country
22 years ago.
   The 900-year-old stone sculpture _ called a lintel, or
crosspiece over a door or window _ has inspired protests from
Chicago to Bangkok by Thais who claim it is an important cultural
icon that was whisked out of their country.
   The Art Institute, however, says it was a gift from a
foundation, bought legally in Bangkok in 1966.
   ``It's become a little political football,'' Art Institute
Director James N. Wood said Wednesday. He met this morning with
Prince Subhadradis Diskul, an expert in art and archeology, who
arrived here late Wednesday.
   ``What we're looking for is an agreement after good face-to-face
negotiations,'' Wood said. ``I don't think the most important thing
is to establish guilt. I don't think it will be productive at all
to talk in those terms.''
   On July 4, about 30 Thai university students staged a peaceful
protest in Bangkok outside the U.S. Embassy, urging the U.S.
government to help return the ancient lintel.
   The relief, carved from the surface of a stone and titled
``Birth of Brahma With Reclining Vishnu On A Makara,'' depicts the
Hindu god Vishnu reclining on water. It dates to Cambodia's Khmer
dynasty from 805-1250 A.D.
   The Thai government says it belongs over a doorway in the
Cambodian temple of Khao Phanomrung in northeastern Thailand.
   ``The piece is central to the whole temple,'' said Wutisak
Lapcharoensap, a University of Chicago graduate student who has
organized sidewalk protests at the Art Institute. ``In terms of
historical interest, this piece is very important.''
   Wood had suggested earlier that he would be willing to loan the
piece to Thailand in exchange for another art treasure. But on
Wednesday, he declined to talk about a specific plan.
   ``What we're looking for is something that will satisfy the just
demands of both parties. We need to hear what the prince has to
say,'' Wood said.
   The piece was purchased by a dealer in Bangkok, who sold it to a
New York dealer, who finally sold it to the Alsdorf Foundation of
Winnetka, Ill., said Art Institute spokeswoman Eileen Harakal.
   The carving was on loan to the Art Institute from 1967 until
1983, when the foundation made it a gift, she said.
   ``It was sold on the open market in Bangkok,'' Ms. Harakal said.
``There have been a lot of misunderstandings on that point and I
want to make that clear.''
   The Thai Embassy in Washington wrote to the foundation in 1976
saying the piece may have been illegally removed from Thailand. The
foundation wrote twice _ in 1976 and 1977 _ asking for proof, but
never received any, Ms. Harakal said.
   ``To this day, no proof has been given,'' she said.
   The sculpture was taken off display during the spring and is now
in storage at the Art Institute. But Thais say it belongs to them.
   Mana Treelayapewat, vice secretary of the Student Federation of
Thailand, said during the protest earlier this month that he and
three other student leaders had submitted a letter to the embassy
and a garland to the American people for the Fourth of July.
   The students carried placards reading ``Happy Birthday the Great
America,'' and ``The lintel belongs to Thailand.''

   Survivors of former Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev have been stripped of unmerited privileges and will
receive only the retirement benefits they earned by their own
labor, Pravda said today.
   The decision reported by the Communist Party daily was a further
blow to the legacy of Brezhnev, whose name is now virtually
synonomous with corruption and stagnation and whose reign is blamed
for many of the problems that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
combatting.
   The move also bolsters Gorbachev's call for social justice and
could broaden public faith in his reform program.
   Brezhnev led the move by top-ranking Kremlin officials in 1964
to topple Nikita S. Khrushchev. He replaced Khrushchev as Communist
Party chief and held the post until his death in 1982.
   Galina Brezhnev, his daughter, scandalized Moscow with her
high-rolling lifestyle in the final years of Brezhnev's rule.
   Official media have said Galina's husband, Yuri Churbanov, will
be put on trial for abusing power during his five years as deputy
interior minister and for accepting bribes equivalent to 270 years'
pay for the average Soviet factory worker.
   In an interview with the social minister of the Russian
federation, Viktor A. Kaznacheyev, a Pravda correspondent said
there were rumors that Galina, her brother Yuri, Brezhnev's brother
Yakov and Churbanov's father Mikhail were receiving a ``special
pension.''
   Kaznacheyev replied, ``I can announce that a decision has been
taken in our ministry according to which all the named people have
been deprived of their undeserved pensions and other privileges.''
   He said they had been left with ``normal pensions in accordance
with the positions that they held. And according to the norms that
are defined by legislation.''
   Kaznacheyev did not specify what retirement benefits the members
of the Brezhnev clan would retain. It was a harsh decision by
Soviet standards, under which the survivors of supreme state or
government officials often retain access to private country homes,
lavish Moscow apartments and other perks.
   The Kremlin, however, has been looking with increasing disfavor
on the legacy of the Brezhnev years as Gorbachev wages his campaign
for a modernized economy and a reduction in bureaucrats' powers. In
January, the Soviet government stripped Brezhnev's name from a
city, town squares and a Moscow neighborhood, claiming citizens had
demanded a decisive break with the late leader's legacy of
corruption and economic stagnation.

   A magistrate fined a prominent television
director $128 Thursday for causing unnecessary suffering to a
turtle, but cleared her on charges of causing similar suffering to
a sparrow.
   Rachel Zen, 37, a director for Radio Television Hong Kong, was
fined in connection with the making of the drama ``Life Goes On''
about a cancer patient.
   In one scene, a woman poured scalding water onto a turtle in a
wok to make a special soup that reputedly helps fight cancer. In
another scene, a sparrow was shown struggling in a burning cage
until it died.
   Zen defended the scenes in court, saying that she wanted to show
the character, a cancer patient's wife, was trying every method to
save her husband.
   The fire scene was to show that life was merciless, she said.
   Zen was found innocent of the sparrow charge, as a hole had been
made to allow the bird to escape. Magistrate Peter Line said she
was negligent but not reckless.

   Sheep-shearing, considered something of
an art in rural Australia, may soon be done by a robot being tested
on blindfolded sheep, researchers said Thursday.
   The robot's developers are using the same technology used to
build cars, but the project presents some unique problems, said Dr.
Neil Evans, manager for research and development at the Australian
Wool Corp.
   ``Every car has the same shape. Every sheep has a different
shape,'' Evans said. He said the process gets even more complex as
the shearing gets closer to the sheep's skin.
   Evans said despite the difficulties, several robot prototypes
have been built and tested on blindfolded sheep.
   ``From the sheep's point of view, it's probably better than
conventional shearing,'' he said without elaboration.
   Researchers at the University of Western Australia have already
spent 11 years and $3.25 million on the project, said Evans.

   About 1,700 people rallied Thursday near an
unfinished nuclear power plant on the northern island of Hokkaido
to protest the arrival of 75 tons of nuclear fuel at the facility,
officials said.
   Fifty other protesters held a sit-in outside the head office in
Sapporo of the Hokkaido Electric Power Co., operator of the Tomari
plant, said company spokesman Koichi Sato.
   Sato said protesters chanted slogans against the Tomari Nuclear
Power plant, 42 miles west of Sapporo, and held a banner that read:
``Stop the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant.''
   The nuclear fuel is being unloaded from a ship from northern
Japan, Sato said. The first of two 579,000-kilowatt reactors at the
$3.68 billion plant is scheduled to begin testing in October and
begin operation next June, he said.
   Japan currently operates 35 nuclear reactors that supplied about
29 percent of the nation's electricity last year, government
statistics show.

   Police are using commercial taxis as a
camouflage in searches for people who might try to disrupt this
year's Olympic Games in Seoul, a senior official said.
   Home Minister Lee Choon-ku, in charge of the country's
135,000-member police force, told the National Assembly Wednesday
that the use of taxis as camouflage began early this year.
   Lee was responding to questions by an opposition lawmaker who
claimed police were using taxis for political eavesdropping in some
cases.
   The minister said the government planned to operate 54 police
taxis until the end of the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics as part of
efforts to protect the Games from terrorist attacks.

   A Cabinet minister said Thursday that European
integration should not be taken as far as developing a single
European language _ because she said the language inevitably would
be English.
   Minister for European Affairs Edith Cresson said Europeans
should work together to defend French as well as Italian, German
and other languages ``because language is also culture and we must
be able to talk to each other.''
   Interviewed on RTL radio, the minister said plans to eliminate
the borders among the 12 European Economic Community countries
should not apply to language.
   ``There should not be a single language in Europe, because it
would inevitably be English,'' she said.
   ``Children in the Netherlands or Denmark all speak a foreign
language and sometimes two,'' she said. ``There is no reason why
our children, if we start them young learning languages in an
attractive and lively way, could not do it.''

   Floods and disease spread by
contaminated water have killed at least 370 people since the annual
monsoon rains began late last month, officials and news reports
said Thursday.
   Cholera and gastroenteritis have reached epidemic proportions in
New Delhi, overwhelming hospitals and prompting severe criticism of
how the city handles water and sewage facilities.
   Cases of the two diseases also have been reported in Uttar
Pradesh and Punjab states north of the capital. Officials
throughout the region have urged people to boil water used for
drinking or cooking.
   Agriculture Minister Bhajan Lal said this year's monsoon, which
began in late June and is expected to last through August, has been
the best for crops since 1983 and should bring good yields of grain
and vegetables for India's 800 million people.
   Crops depend on the annual rains, but the monsoon also is
putting too much water into heavily silted rivers. Water seeping
through garbage and sewage has contaminated wells.
   The number of people killed by drowning or house collapses rose
to to 212 on Thursday with 12 deaths reported in Kashmir, a
northern state, and the western state of Maharashtra, Indian news
agencies reported.
   At least 96 people have died of cholera and gastroenteritis in
New Delhi this month, acording to government figures issued
Thursday. Many were children.
   A New Delhi official, who insisted on anonymity, said more than
7,152 people had been treated in the city's hospitals _ more than
four times the number for all of July 1987. He reported 239
confirmed cholera cases.
   Fifty deaths from the two diseases were reported in Punjab state
to the north and 12 in Ghaziabad, near New Delhi in Uttar Pradesh
state.
   Heavy rains have sent rivers over their banks in 11 of India's
25 states, said A.M. Bhola, a Central Water Commission official. He
estimated at least 2.5 million acres of land were underwater.
   Bhola criticized state governments, which are responsible for
flood control, for concentrating on stop-gap measures and delaying
dam construction. ``We find that the states do not allocate full
funds'' for flood prevention, he said.
   News dispatches said roads were submerged and telephone lines
down in northern Himachal Pradesh state, landslides blocked
highways near the hill town of Darjeeling and rail service was
disrupted in eastern Assam state.
   In New Delhi, the spread of water-borne disease has overtaxed
health facilities to the point that some hospitals put three
children in a bed and patients lie on blankets on the floor.
   Much of the disease is found in densely populated slums near the
Yamuna River that are not connected to the city water system and
rely on wells.
   The opposition Janata (People's) Party demanded this week that
the mayor of New Delhi and its lieutenant governor, the chief
administrator, resign because of ``criminal negligence and
concealment of facts.''
   A party statement said official figures understate the death
toll and 200 people may have perished from water-borne diseases. It
said city officials were ``directly responsible for the spread of
the epidemic.''
   An editorial Thursday in the Times of India said much of the
disease was spread by contaminated water taken by slum dwellers
from shallow wells provided by the city, and declared:
   ``The Delhi administration did not anticipate the water
contamaination, a sad reflection of its indifference. The concerned
officials were simply not ready with a strategy what are considered
to be statistically established annual deaths.''
   City agencies blame each other.
   Officials of the Delhi Development Authority, previously
responsibile for water and sanitation in the slums, say no problems
existed when authority was transferred June 1 to the Delhi
Municipal Corporation.
   Municipal Corporation officials told a news conference Wednesday
garbage had not been collected in the slums since February and the
epidemic was the development agency's fault.

<TEXT>
   Two nuns who were threatened with
expulsion for supporting a right to an abortion said today they
have resigned from their order.
   In June, officials of the Roman Catholic Church had sent word
from Rome that they would not proceed with the ``process to
dismiss'' Sisters Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey from the
Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur.
   ``We now believe that the leadership has affirmed the right to
be a member and hold public positions on non-infallible teachings
that differ from official church teachings,'' the nuns said in a
letter of resignation made public today.
   The controversy began in 1984 when Hussey and Ferraro, along
with 95 other Catholics, signed an advertisement in The New York
Times saying that there is a diversity of opinion about abortion
with the church.
   Since then, the church repeatedly has asked Hussey and Ferraro
to retract their support of a woman's right to choose abortion. The
nuns have refused.

<HEAD>College Scholarship For Every Senior</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMERYVILLE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A school district that ``used to be
the laughing stock'' because of its financial troubles now has
enough money to give $1,000 scholarships to all its college-bound
graduates.
   ``We can afford it,'' said Superintendent Peter Corona. ``We've
managed these funds so well that we can now put more into the
education of our students.''
   The scholarship fund is similar to much-publicized private
endowments promised to students in Oakland and New York's Harlem
district. ``Everybody gets a fair shot,'' Corona said. ``We'll pay
for books, supplies, everything.''
   The scholarship plan was approved unanimously Monday by the
Board of Education. It could amount to about $30,000 next year for
the estimated 30 seniors who would be eligible.
   ``These poor kids don't have anything,'' Corona said of students
in the district with one high school, one elementary school and
fewer than 500 students. The district is 99 percent minority.
   ``We're telling them that there's a light at the end of the
tunnel, and we really care about you,'' he said.
   The district, located between Oakland and Berkeley, was broke
and on the verge of extinction five years ago.
   Most students come from single-parent households supported by
welfare, and the district's income had fallen becuase of budget
cutbacks and inefficient management, said Corona, who took over in
1982.
   Corona is credited for much of the district's turnaround since
it was forced to take a $600,000 state bailout loan in 1983. Staff
and expenditures were cut drastically and the district gradually
built its funds, he said.
   ``This district used to be the laughing stock,'' he said. ``It
isn't that way anymore. What we've had to overcome in this district
far surpasses what Iacocca had to do with Chrysler.''
   He said there will be no problem fitting the scholarship fund
into the district's $3 million budget _ which includes a $1.3
million reserve.
   Test scores in the district also have improved dramatically. In
1987, student test scores jumped more than those of any other
district in the state.

<HEAD>Lower The Lights! Go Music!: Orchestrating the Convention for TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California delegation was poised to give
Michael Dukakis a nominating majority. ``Sneak 'em down, sneak 'em
down,'' producer Gary Smith told his light man. ``Stand by, ready
to bring 'em up, ready music, NOT NOW _ NOT NOW... GO! MUSIC!''
   The floor demonstration erupted on cue and Smith, exhilarated by
his handiwork, stood up and clapped before returning to the
business before him: orchestrating the Democratic National
Convention for TV consumption.
   From the Boy Scout color guard to the singing of the national
anthem, through endless speeches and stirring musical interludes,
Smith was on alert, barking instructions and throwing hand signals
to operatives all over the cavernous hall.
   ``Lower the lights! Hold it! Hold it! Lower the podium! And _
music!'' Smith yelled into his telephone headset as a 13-year-old
walked on stage to lead the national anthem.
   No sooner had he finished than Smith was gesticulating wildly at
the podium from his lofty perch atop the camera platform, a
makeshift control area known familiarly as Tech Tower. Nothing
serious. The Boy Scouts in the color guard couldn't figure out when
to leave. ``I told them to watch me,'' he explained.
   Smith, a compact man with glasses and a mustache, relaxed
occasionally with a cigar but spent much of his night in overdrive.
His eyes flickered among five television monitors; he covered his
podium schedule with scribbles; he answered his red phone
incessantly; and he talked steadily into an open headset line to
the stage manager, the TelePrompTer operator, the orchestra
conductor and his partner, the director of the show, Dwight Hemion.
   In contrast, low-key sound and lighting technicians sipped Cokes
and ate tacos at their wide consoles, controlling the convention
atmosphere almost offhandedly between bites.
   ``I've worked for everyone from Sting to Kiss,'' said Don Tyra,
who designed the convention light system. ``This is not as
fast-paced, but it's very critical due to the fact that you're live
to the world. There's no room for error. Any mistake will be seen
by millions.''
   There were plenty of small mistakes, but Smith handled them.
   When an Indiana delegate tried to introduce three governors
using a dead mike, Smith sized up the situation instantly and
switched on a mike at his desk. ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he said
in the deep voice of a master of ceremonies, referring to his
podium schedule. ``The governor of Colorado, Roy Romer.''
   The schedule was in constant flux as the program fell further
and further behind. Smith said he wasn't worried because a
46-minute ``recess'' had been built in for just such a possibility.
   But when the recess arrived, party officials had not yet decided
whether to cancel it. Long seconds passed with an empty podium and
apparent anarchy in the hall.
   Ah, but there really was someone in charge. ``Some music!''
Smith shrieked into his headset. ``Some music!'' On with the show.
   Between his shouts to the conductor and the simple hand gestures
he used to communicate with Tyra, Smith drew combinations of music
and lighting that literally stopped and started floor
demonstrations in addition to underscoring dramatic or significant
moments.
   Plans for the instant Dukakis would clinch the nomination were
made nearly five hours before it happened, as California Lt. Gov.
Leo McCarthy was telling delegates that the least his state could
do to atone for sending the nation Ronald Reagan was to send George
Bush home, ``wherever that is.''
   ``California's going to be putting him over the top,'' Smith
told Tyra. ``They want California to pass (on the first round of
voting) ... You'll feel it in the hall. We'll bring the lights
down. They'll say California, and we'll bring the lights up.''
   Tyra took the hall slowly into darkness as the moment
approached, then blasted it with light as California announced its
235 votes for Dukakis. The orchestra burst into a medley of ``It's
a Grand Old Flag'' and ``The Washington Post March.'' Smith was so
moved _ or perhaps relieved _ that he stood and clapped briefly
along with the exuberant delegates.
   But he was quickly back to himself. ``Turn the lights down a
little bit,'' he told Tyra. ``Keep the spotlights going.'' A
horrible realization dawned. ``Is NBC gone? IS NBC GONE? YES?''
Into the headset, ``OK! CUT IT!'' The orchestra fell instantly
silent, the demonstrators subsided.
   The networks, it turned out, had abandoned the long
demonstration and returned to local programming. It was a cue that
Smith, the veteran Hollywood professional, could not ignore.

   Among European broadcasters covering the
Democratic National Convention, Tony Naets henceforth will be known
as the man who ``blew up'' the foreign pool at Atlanta.
   In this case, the pool in question is a small, orange,
inflatable variety. It sits on bare asphalt in a small clearing
among 22 mobile office trailers clustered together in a fenced-in
section of a subterranean parking lot on the outskirts of the
convention center.
   At night, during convention lulls, the foreign reporters who
work in the complex sit around the pool. They drink beer and toss
coins into the water as they trade gossip and news tidbits.
   ``Some people jokingly call this complex the `European
ghetto,''' said Naets, the New York-based bureau chief of the
European Broadcasting Union, a cooperative that includes 37 nations.
   The EUB is the largest member of the Foreign Broadcasting
Service, an organization set up by the American television networks
to provide working facilities and technical assistance, including
satellite access, to foreign broadcasters.
   ``We've got about 400 people working in this complex,'' said
Bill Headline, a Cable News Network executive who is running the
FBS operation at the convention.
   The broadcasting operations in the FBS complex range in size
from the CBC, which had four trailers and more than 60 employees,
to Monaco Radio, with just one reporter.
   ``This place may not look like much,'' Headline said, ``but it
is a very sophisticated technical operation that provides our
clients with video and audio feeds, a collective studio and
stand-up positions both here and in a sky booth at the convention
hall.''
   The catch, of course, is that all 39 broadcasting agencies using
the facilities must share the one studio and the two stand-up
positions.
   ``These people are professionals and they understand they're at
the bottom of everyone's list,'' Headline said. ``The Democrats are
blatant enough to simply say outright that the foreign broadcasters
really don't matter to them because their viewers aren't voting in
this election.''
   Still, conditions have been trying at times, said Francois
Champey, a broadcaster for La Cinq, a French television station.
   ``It can be pure hell,'' she said. ``There are six or eight
cubicles in the editing trailers and somebody in the one next to me
always seems to be yelling in loud Italian or German when I'm doing
a taped voice-over.''
   Naets looked out the window toward the ``village green'' where
the orange plastic wading pool sat steaming in the sizzling
afternoon sun.
   ``We're taking all of our trailers with us down to New Orleans
for the Republican convention in August,'' he said. ``I'll be
taking the pool along, too, but unfortunately we won't have a
village green down there. Instead, we'll be lined up in grid, like
an American trailer park.''
   What about the coins in the pool?
   ``I'll scoop them out when I deflate the pool since I'm the one
who blew it up,'' he said, laughing.

   Former prison guard Danny Dill still has
nightmares about the day 10 years ago when he clung to life, bloody
and swollen, on a cellhouse floor for two hours while rampaging
inmates beat and stabbed three fellow guards to death.
   But Dill dreams that the story of his ordeal at the Pontiac
Correctional Center will make prisons safer.
   ``It was pure hell but I believe God spared me for one reason _
to speak out and try to change things,'' said Dill, who is
completing a book on his experiences at the prison that holds some
of the state's toughest criminals.
   However, some things have not changed since the riot on July 22,
1978. No one has been convicted of murdering the guards. And,
despite improvements in security, officials say another deadly riot
could happen.
   In addition to the three guards who were killed, three were
wounded and there was more than $4 million in damage to the
19th-century prison in a residental neighborhood in this small
northern Illinois city of 11,000 people.
   Dill, 40, left the department after two years on medical leave
and 38 operations in one year. The other wounded guards returned to
Pontiac.
   ``I still have nightmares,'' said Dill. ``I think of my fellow
officers and friends who were tortured and killed.''
   ``This anniversary does not pass easily. We'll always
remember,'' said Corrections Commissioner Michael Lane. ``I believe
the place is more safe and humane than it was 10 years ago, but it
is not safe enough.''
   The violence erupted on a quiet Saturday morning when 550
inmates were being taken from an exercise yard to their cellhouse,
and 600 more prisoners were leaving an auditorium after a movie.
   About 250 riot-equipped officers restored order. The violence
was over in an hour and the prison was declared secure eight hours
after it all began. Hundreds of homemade knives and other weapons
were recovered.
   ``They wanted to take control of the whole prison,'' said Dill.
``Gang leaders had a list of targets _ we were tough but firm and
they didn't like that. I heard every one of our names called out.''
   Dill maintains the riot was planned and should have been
expected. State officials said it was a surprise _ perhaps
triggered by the heat, overcrowding or a gang fight that got out of
control.
   Thirty-one inmates were indicted on charges ranging from
burglary to murder, but only eight eventually were convicted, on
the lesser offenses.
   The guards' families sued prison officials, and in 1984 a
federal jury ruled there was negligence and awarded the plaintiffs
$852,637. However, an appeals court set aside the judgment in 1986
saying the guards knew the risks when they went to work at the
prison.
   ``The state must protect those it throws into snake pits, but
the state need not guarantee that volunteer snake charmers will not
be bitten,'' the appellate opinion said.
   There have been some improvements at Pontiac. There are more
guards and fewer prisoners. The state also has spent about $30.6
million since 1978 for new guard towers, more fencing, catwalks and
better lighting.
   Lane calls those ``Band-aids'' for a prison that needs ``major
surgery.''
   He wants the state Legislature to approve money for new
cellhouses, and to recognize that, despite the opening of some new
prisons, the department needs additional funds to handle an overall
prison population that has doubled to 20,000 in 10 years.
   ``We're out of room now,'' said Lane. ``The population is going
back up at Pontiac. I have no place else to go with them.''
   Since 1978, two other employees have been killed at the Pontiac
prison.
   ``There may be fewer inmates but they are younger, more
aggressive, more volatile and more gang-oriented,'' said Bob
Ellinger, president of the local guard union. ``Pontiac is still a
very dangerous place.''

   Steve Akey and Joyce Carrier, top aides to
Michael Dukakis, have had a frantic Democratic National Convention
week dealing with vital questions of logistics, media _ and mother.
   Mother is the one planning their wedding next week.
   ``Yesterday's question was what kind of champagne glasses do we
want,'' said Akey, whose job was running the press center at
Dukakis' hotel.
   Akey and Ms. Carrier, Dukakis' national director of advance
work, met in Boston during the early days of the campaign. Their
desks were next to each other in Boston, and they immediately
struck up a rapport.
   ``I've worked for Dukakis since '83 so I knew all about Michael
Dukakis and nothing about presidential campaigning and she knew
presidential campaigning and nothing about Michael Dukakis,'' he
said. ``So we had a lot of sessions at the lobby bar and we became
best friends.''
   Dukakis' nomination runs a close second to the excitement of the
July 30 wedding, Akey said, even though Ms. Carrier's mother has
had to handle the arrangements.
   And will the man who brought them together attend?
   ``No, he'll be campaigning,'' Akey said.

   Next month, 35,000 of the faithful will
congregate at Graceland at the grave of Elvis Presley and pay
homage to the King of Rock 'n' Roll on the anniversary of his death.
   Only problem is Elvis _ born Jan. 8, 1935, died Aug. 16, 1977 _
could be out visiting friends or vacationing, according to a new
book and assorted tabloid stories.
   This is not amusing to employees at Graceland.
   ``Elvis is alive'' rumors have floated since Elvis' death turned
his Memphis, Tenn., mansion into a wailing wall-cum-tourist trap,
but in recent months they've been the focus of talk shows, radio
programs and ... and ... this story.
   Tabloid readers, responding to a ``Spot the King'' campaign,
have reported sighting Elvis watching a stock car race in
Minnesota, fishing in upstate New York and dining in the California
wine country.
   If the King only temporarily abdicated, how has he avoided
detection _ a man with 45 gold records, 80 top-selling albums, 170
hit singles, and millions of obsessive fans?
   ``Elvis' cover _ if he is alive _ is there's so many Elvis
lookalikes,'' explains Gail Brewer-Giorgio, author of the book ``Is
Elvis Alive?,'' which questions many of the circumstances
surrounding Elvis' death.
   ``Do you know of anybody who has more imitators? The person on
the street could be fooled by a look-alike _ or it could be
Elvis,'' Brewer-Giorgio said in a telephone interview this week.
   Presley was not immediately available for comment. But among the
evidence cited by Brewer-Giorgio to support a living Elvis:
   _ Elvis' Graceland grave has his middle name spelled Aaron; it's
spelled Aron on his birth certificate, his marriage license, and in
most crossword puzzles. Convinced yet?
   _ Many fans believed Elvis looked different and waxen in his
coffin _ in fact, that it was a wax replica cooled by an air
conditioner to prevent the false King from melting like the Wicked
Witch of the West. How about now?
   _ The Incredible Elvis Tape, a 60-minute cassette which purports
to present telephone conversations recorded four years after Elvis'
death. The King explains his need for privacy, his travels around
Europe, and his desire to get back on stage.
   ``I needed the rest even more than I knew,'' says the taped
voice. ``And after about a year, I started missing the people and
the entertaining. ... It's been a constant battle, growing beards
and this and that, to keep from being recognized.''
   Still skeptical?
   Well, Brewer-Giorgio also points out that an anagram for
``Elvis'' is ``lives'' _ and you still don't believe?
   Some fans believe: 270,000 people nationwide have called to hear
the tape, with 50,000 of them voting on whether Elvis was alive.
The vote has been running 2-to-1 in favor of a living, breathing
Elvis, said Gerry Sindell, chairman of Tudor Publishing, which put
out the book.
   Each caller paid 50 cents per call to vote, and $2 to hear the
tape.
   Diane Pullman of Brooklyn, a Presley fan since 1953 who spent
the last several years in an effort to have Elvis' birthday
declared a national holiday, doesn't discount the staged death
theory.
   ``I was walking myself near the Walker Theater when I saw this
guy who looked just like Elvis Presley,'' Mrs. Pullman said. ``It
could be him, unless he had plastic surgery.''
   Todd Morgan, a spokesman at Graceland, flatly dismissed the
story.
   ``All of us who work here, when we go home and see our families,
our friends, other business people, the first thing we hear is,
`Seen Elvis lately?' or `Has he come home yet?' It's beginning to
get aggravating,'' said Morgan.
   Is it fact? Is it fiction? Perhaps it's best to end with the
final words from ``Is Elvis Alive?''
   ``Around the 10th anniversary of the death of Elvis Presley, an
Atlanta attorney, who had been working in the Gary Hart campaign,
responded to the rumor that Gary Hart would run again with this
statement: `The probability of Gary Hart seeking the nomination for
president of the United States is as unlikely as believing Elvis
Presley is still alive.'
   ``Less than four months after this statement, Gary Hart again
announced his candidacy for president of the United States.''

   Two teams of U.N. observers will travel to
Iran and Iraq in the next days to work out details of a cease-fire
in the war and investigate the situation of war prisoners, U.N.
officials said today.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani told reporters that Iran had
given assurances of safe conduct and cooperation for the teams but
that Iraq had not yet made a similar commitment.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced Wednesday
that military observers would travel to the warring nations to help
implement a U.N. cease-fire resolution passed one year ago but not
accepted by Iran until Monday.
   Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar was dispatching a second team to
investigate the situation of prisoners of war in both countries.
Repatriation of POWs is part of the U.N. plan to end the nearly
8-year-old war.
   Iraq has complained that thousands of its prisoners of war in
Iran are tortured and murdered.
   Giuliani said the second group was being asembled in Geneva and
was expected to go to Iran over the weekend, then visit Iraq. It
will return to Geneva to prepare its report, he said.
   ``The mission will endeavor to ascertain the facts and inquire
into the concerns expressed by the two governments with a view to
ensuring observance of relevant rules of international humanitarian
law,'' Giuliani said.
   U.N. officials said the eight-member group of military observers
will leave Vienna and Jerusalem in the next few days. It will
include military officers from the U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization based in Jerusalem, two observers already in Tehran
and Baghdad, and Raymond Sommereyns, a senior officer in the office
for Special Political Affairs in New York.
   The exact itinerary was not announced, but the group was
expected first to visit Tehran this weekend, then travel to Baghdad.
   Lt.-Gen. Martin Vadset will head the group.
   ``We will start from scratch, and the main issue now is to have
the parties agree on the technical implementation of a truce which
can form the foundation for the peace negotiations,'' Vadset said.
   The 57-year-old Norwegian general was in Vienna and was
interviewed by Norwegian media.
   The first dozen or so observers eventually will be joined by up
to 250 officers from various countries who would monitor cease-fire
implementation.
   The group investigating the prisoner of war situation includes
Wolfram Karl, professor of international law at the University of
Salzburg, Austria; Torkel Opsahl, professor of international law at
the University of Oslo, Norway; and Maj. Gen. Rene Bats of the
Belgian Army, Giuliani said.
   G.B. Ramcharan, a senior political officer in the U.N.
Secretariat, will accompany the mission, he said.
   Giuliani also said that Perez de Cuellar had no comment on
Iraq's five-point proposal to help implement the cease-fire
resolution.
   That proposal, contained in a letter released Wednesday, called
for direct, formal U.N.-sponsored talks between Iran and Iraq,
along with Iranian promises not to attack Iraqi or other shipping
in the Persian Gulf.
   Iran rejected the idea of direct talks.
   On Monday, Iran announced after a year's delay that it had
accepted Security Council Resolution 598, which demands an
immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a peace plan to
end the war.
   Iraq at first calar a message saying Iraq wants direct talks with
Iran.
   Iraq proposed opening talks at the United Nations, then moving
them to Baghdad and Tehran. Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati told reporters Iran rejected direct talks.
   But another Iranian diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said his
country will observe a cease-fire during the technical team's visit
and continue an informal cease-fire later if Iraq does the same.
   Iraq raided Iranian industrial targets on Tuesday and Iran
responded in kind on Wednesday. Today, Iraq shelled the village of
Sardasht in northern Azerbaijan province, killing one civilian and
injuring two, IRNA said.
   Perez de Cuellar said the team would limit its consultations to
military aspects of the cease-fire: ``I expect the report of the
team will allow me to announce the implementation of the
resolution.''
   The Peruvian said that would include naming the day the
cease-fire takes effect; setting dates for the beginning and
completion of troop withdrawals and exchanges of war prisoners; and
setting a date for the beginning of negotiations on a lasting peace.

<HEAD>Judge Suggests Lighter Sentence If Woman Seeks Sterilization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman convicted of criminal neglect in her
son's death has been offered the possiblity of a reduced sentence
if she is sterilized.
   Melody S. Baldwin faces a possible 20-year sentence after
pleading guilty to neglect of a dependent in the Sept. 5, 1986
death of her 4-year-old son, Joshua.
   Miss Baldwin, 29, is seven months pregnant. She was hospitalized
last week for treatment of malnutrition, authorities said.
   When she was unable to appear in court for her sentencing
hearing July 13, Marion Superior Court Judge Roy F. Jones ordered
her confined for the health and safety of the fetus, and appointed
a guardian to protect its interests.
   Miss Baldwin has agreed to surrender the child for adoption.
   At a hearing Wednesday on Miss Baldwin's medical status, Jones
recommended to Miss Baldwin's attorney, Michael J. Donahoe, that
Miss Baldwin undergo sterilization, and suggested that he might
reduce her sentence if the procedure is completed.
   The judge's remarks followed testimony by two physicians that
Miss Baldwin may have tried to interfere with her intravenous
feeding.
   ``From what I have heard already and what's been presented to
the court, I think it's the court's position she's the type of
person that definitely does not need any children in the future,''
Jones said.
   The judge said that although he had no jurisdiction over whether
Miss Baldwin opts for sterilization, ``I don't think it's something
that I think we should leave unsaid.''
   Donahoe said he would pass along the judge's recommendation to
Miss Baldwin, who did not attend the hearing.
   Representatives of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union called
Jones' proposal outrageous and an impermissible condition of
sentencing.
   ``The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the sterilization of
criminals in 1942,'' said ICLU attorney Richard Waples.
   Timothy L. Bookwalter, a lawyer appointed by the judge to guard
the fetus' interests, said he favors sterilization.
   ``We can't protect her every time she gets pregnant. She is a
dangerous person and could kill this kid too,'' he said.
   During Wednesday's hearing, psychiatrist Balwant S. Mallik said
Miss Baldwin is sane but has a personality disorder and is suicidal.
   Testimony during the sentencing hearing July 13 revealed that
Miss Baldwin had induced her son to take lethal levels of
antipsychotic drugs which had been prescribed for her.
   While the child was hospitalized, nurses discovered that someone
had disconnected alarms on the cardiac and respiratory monitors.
His condition deteriorated and he was declared brain dead on Sept.
3. He was removed from artifical life support systems two days
later and was declared dead.

   Nearly half of the patients who had heart-bypass
operations in three hospitals either should not have had the
procedures or could have done without them, a new study says.
   Eliminating unnecessary coronary bypass operations could lead to
reduced health care costs and improved patient care, said the
study, published in Friday's edition of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Only 56 percent of the 386 coronary bypass operations performed
in the three randomly chosen hospitals from a Western state in
1979, 1980 and 1982 were justified, meaning the benefits outweighed
the risks, the study said.
   Ann Shoben, a spokeswoman for Rand Corp., whose researchers did
the study, declined to identify the hospitals.
   It found that 14 percent of the operations were performed for
inappropriate reasons, and 30 percent for equivocal reasons,
meaning they could be argued either way.
   Bypass operations, first performed 20 years ago, numbered about
230,000 last year in the United States at an estimated cost of $6
billion, according to national figures. This is more than double
the number performed in 1980.
   The study ``certainly points up some problem areas as we sit
here watching the cost of health care rise so quickly,'' said Dr.
Constance Monroe Winslow, who conducted the study with four
colleagues at the University of California-Los Angeles Center for
the Health Sciences.
   While doctors may disagree on whether bypass surgery should be
performed in the equivocal cases, the authors concluded that ``few
would argue with the proposition that the services should go first
of all to patients with clearly appropriate reasons for their use.''
   ``When confronted with scarce resources, planners may wish to
use this type of information to help make difficult allocation
decisions.''
   A typical bypass operation can cost about $30,000.
   In the surgical procedure, doctors take a vein from somewhere
else in the body and use it to reroute blood around a blockage in
the coronary arteries.
   The authors cautioned that although the study is representative
of patients undergoing bypass surgery in western states, ``further
work is needed to generalize these results to the rest of the
United States.''
   Dr. Jack Copeland, a University of Arizona heart surgeon who
heads the school's nationally known heart-transplant program, said,
``I'm not aware of too many instances where there has been an abuse
of this kind of surgery.
   ``I don't doubt there are some abuses, but I would doubt that
it's as significant as one might think looking at such an
article,'' he added.
   In an editorial that accompanied the study in the same issue,
Dr. Albert G. Mulley Jr. and Dr. Kim A. Eagle of Massachusetts
General Hospital and the Harvard Medical School said doctors often
disagreed on the criteria for determining whether a bypass
operation is justified.
   The UCLA researchers used a system designed for the Rand
Corp.-UCLA Health Services Utilization Study to rate the
appropriateness of bypass surgery. The system was devised by a
nine-member panel of physicians.
   The study defined appropriateness to mean that the expected
health benefit of a bypass, including both quality of life and-or
longevity, exceeded the expected negative consequences, including
the risk of death, by a sufficiently wide margin.
   Mulley and Eagle said that if appropriateness ratings made by a
panel in Great Britain were applied, even more bypass operations
would have been considered unjustified.
   ``Policymakers should resist the temptation to use
appropriateness ratings as a quick fix,'' they said. ``The real
need is for more information about the outcomes of medical
practices.''

<HEAD>North Korea Proposes Meeting With South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By K.P. HONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea proposed Thursday that the legislatures
of the two Koreas meet in its capital of Pyongyang to debate a
non-aggression pact drafted by the North.
   South Korean officials in Seoul had no immediate reaction to the
proposal. It appeared unlikely, however, that Pyonguang's call
would lead to a breakthrough in the strained relations between the
rival nations.
   The South Korean government has insisted that it handle any
contacts with the North. The National Assembly, which has a
majority of opposition lawmakers, agreed with that position in June.
   North Korea refused earlier this month to accept two proposals
by the Seoul government for wide-ranging political, economic and
humanitarian talks on easing tension as a step toward eventual
unification of the peninsula.
   Korea has been divided into the communist North and pro-Western
South since 1945 and the two sides fought a war from 1950-53. Each
government insists it is the sole legitimate ruler of Korea and
denounces the other as a puppet regime and dictatorship.
   The North Korean offer was reported by Pyongyang's official
Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo.
   The agency said the North's Supreme People's Assembly proposed
that all South Korean National Assembly members and all North
Korean deputies meet first in August in Pyongyang, then in each of
the two capitals.
   The report said Standing Committee Chairman Yang Hyong Sop of
North Korea's Parliament made the proposal in a letter sent
Thursday through the Panmunjom truce village to South Korea's
National Assembly speaker, Kim Chae-sun.
   In Seoul, Kim's aides confirmed he received the letter, but said
its contents would be distributed to the nation's political parties
before it was made public.
   South Korean officials said Yang's letter was a response to a
letter from Kim, sent through Panmunjom on Monday, in which he
urged the North to compete in the 1988 Olympic Games beginning
Sept. 17 in Seoul.
   The text of Yang's letter, carried by the news agency, also
proposed Yang and Kim serve as co-chairmen of the joint sessions,
and each preside over the sessions held in his country's capital.
   Both Koreas have unsuccessfully proposed similar non-aggression
pacts in the past. But it was the first time a joint parliamentary
session was proposed, said Radio Press, a Japanese agency that
monitors communist broadcasts.
   In 1986, North Korea broke off preliminary parliamentary talks
with the South, one of several channels of communication opened in
the early 1970s along with economic and Red Cross talks. The North
was protesting annual U.S.-South Korea military exercises called
Team Spirit.
   The North has threatened to boycott the Olympic Games unless it
is made a co-host. International Olympic officials rejected the
demand, saying the games are awarded only to one city.
   North Korea's rubber-stamp Supreme People's Assembly, which
meets only several days a year in February or March, had 655
members when it was elected in November 1986. South Korean's
National Assembly has 299 members, 166 of them opposition members.
   The opposition made a strong comeback in legislative elections
in April, stripping the governing party of its parliamentary
majority for the first time in South Korea's 40-year history.
   
   The North proposed that a non-aggression pact declare the North
and South not use force against each other; resolve differences
through negotiations; not participate in foreign aggression against
the other; reduce their armed forces; and withdraw foreign forces
and nuclear weapons.
   It also proposes the demarcation line of non-aggression between
the two sides be the current military demarcation line and that the
demilitarized zone be made a genuine buffer zone with an inspection
force from neutral nations kept in the DMZ.
   The United States stations about 40,000 troops in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty. North Korea alleges the U.S. troops
have nuclear weapons.

   A truck company owner says he is
sick of medical waste washing up on New Jersey and New York beaches
and is posting $10,000 to help find the culprits.
   ``I'm totally disgusted,'' said Brad Honigsberg. ``It's a
natural God-given resource that should not be denied any citizen.
To have a few discourteous people acting in a criminal fashion ...
''
   Honigsberg said Wednesday the reward is being offered in the
name of his air freight trucking company, Air Contact Transport Inc.
   The 39-year-old Hopatcong resident said he is a longtime
beachgoer and has many friends who rely on the summertime beach
economy. He said he decided to post the reward after visiting Point
Pleasant beach this week.
   ``It's absolutely dead down there,'' he said. ``The boardwalk
should be teeming with people.''
   Syringes, vials of blood and other waste have washed up on the
New Jersey shore this summer, and miles of popular beaches on New
York's Long Island were closed over the July 4 weekend because of
medical waste.

<TEXT>
   Stress disorders have afflicted some
survivors, medical personnel and rescue workers involved in the
deadly collapse of a department store.
   Fourteen people were killed and 47 others were injured when The
Amigo Store collapsed July 7.
   Tamara Cowen, a 35-year-old nurse who supervised a triage center
near the store, said she still cannot remember everything she did
in the hours after the disaster.
   Ms. Cowen identified bodies as they were pulled from the rubble
and scheduled doctors and nurses around the clock to treat victims
and exhausted rescue workers.
   For days afterward, she said, she could not sleep without
dreaming she was back at the treatment area, the sound of dump
trucks and bulldozers ringing in her ears. She cried, and
repeatedly returned to the scene after the rubble had been cleared.
   Counselors at Valley Regional Medical Center said Ms. Cowen
suffered from ``post-traumatic stress disorder,'' a normal response
to such an upsetting experience.
   Psychologist Jay Martinez led a counseling session last week at
the hospital, where a group of mostly medical professionals
expressed their feelings after the disaster. All reported some form
of post-traumatic stress, including feelings of irritability,
frustration, helplessness and guilt, Martinez said.
   Dr. Ralph Jones, another counselor working with disaster
survivors, said the stress disorder ``is the same thing many of the
Vietnam veterans experienced and are still experiencing.''
   Jones said he counseled one woman who is afraid to leave her
house, especially if it means going downtown. Other survivors are
irritable toward family members or have suppressed emotions
altogether.
   ``The major thing is to get them to talk about it _ express
their feelings,'' Jones said.
   It is important for those affected to revisit the disaster site,
accept what happened and move on, Martinez said. For that reason,
city officials held a memorial ceremony on the lot once it was
cleared.

   A drug dealer who disguised himself as a
lawyer nearly escaped from prison but was tripped up by his
distinctive walk, authorities said.
   Elrader ``Ray Ray'' Browning Jr. was wearing street clothes, an
Afro wig and false mustache and was carrying a briefcase and a copy
of the Rules of Criminal Procedure when he summoned a guard and
asked to be released from the prison's attorney interview room
Saturday, said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Gordon.
   A guard, who hadn't recognized Browning on sight, did recognize
his jaunty gait, Gordon said. The inmate got no farther than the
interview room door, the prosecutor said.
   Inside the briefcase, authorities found a driver's license, a
credit card, a jail jumpsuit and the glue that apparently had been
used to affix the mustache.
   ``All we can hypothesize at this point is he'd been squirreling
away these items,'' Gordon said.
   Loose ceiling tiles in the interview room at Terminal Island
federal prison indicated that the items may have been brought in by
visitors to the low- to medium-security facilty over the last few
weeks, he said.
   Browning, said to be the leader of a $2 million-a-month cocaine
and heroin ring, acted as his own attorney during a trial at which
he was convicted of 43 drug-related felonies. He faces a mandatory
term of life without parole at sentencing Aug. 22.
   Deputy U.S. Marshal Walter Dayton said Browning and another man
met with attorney Larry Elkins in the interview room Saturday.
   Elkins left about an hour before the escape attempt, Gordon
said. He added that authorities had been unable to reach Elkins. A
call to his office before business hours today went unanswered.
   The incident was the seventh escape or attempted escape in the
last four months at Terminal Island, the only federal prison in the
Los Angeles area.
   Warden R.D. Brewer attributed the recent rash of escape attempts
to a nearly 50 percent increase in the number of prisoners awaiting
sentencing housed at Terminal Island, which he said was never
designed to house the kind of high-risk inmates often held there.

<HEAD>U.S., Vietnam Officials To Discuss Efforts to Locate Missing
Americans</HEAD>

   U.S. and Vietnamese officials will meet next
week in Hanoi to discuss joint efforts to search for Americans
missing from the war, administration spokesmen said Thursday. And
they released the names of four servicemen whose remains were
returned by the Vietnamese this year.
   U.S. officials also welcomed a statement by the Vietnamese
foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, that he would try to resolve by
the end of year 70 so-called discrepancy cases, among them,
Americans believed to have been captured by the Vietnamese.
   The Vietnamese offers come amid increasing signs that communist
authorities in that Southeast Asian nation wish to improve
relations with the West. The biggest step has been withdrawal of
some Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.
   ``We are pleased to confirm that Vietnam has offered to work
jointly with the United States on concerted efforts to resolve the
issue of American military and civilian personnel still missing and
unaccounted for from the Vietnam war,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley. A Pentagon spokesman read an identical
statement.
   The Vietnamese offer stemmed from a meeting in New York on June
8 between Gen. John Vessey, a presidential envoy, and the
Vietnamese foreign minister ``to discuss accelerated cooperation on
humanitarian issues of concern,'' she said.
   Last August, Vessey gave the Vietnamese a list of 200
discrepancy cases, describing 70 of them as ``compelling'' and
warranting urgent action.
   Vessey, asked by President Reagan to handle unresolved
prisoner-of-war and missing-in-action issues from the Vietnam War,
has defined discrepancy cases as those ``for whom there was strong
evidence that they survived their incident and were captured or
otherwise came under Vietnamese control, or about whom the
Vietnamese authorities should have information.''
   The U.S. statement said ``we have long urged Vietnam to agree to
joint activities, such as field investigations, surveys and
excavations, to expedite the resolution of the POW-MIA issue.''
   ``The Vietnamese offer is an encouraging development that will
facilitate this objective, and we look forward to greatly expanded
cooperation in the coming months,'' it said. ``The two governments
have agreed to hold planning meetings in Hanoi July 25-28 to
discuss technical aspects of implementing this offer.''
   The head of the U.S. delegation heading to Hanoi will be Lt.
Col. Joe Harvey, the commanding officer of the Joint Casualty
Resolution Center, the statement said.
   At the same time, the Pentagon released the names of four
servicemen whose remains were returned or recovered earlier.
   Their names, hometowns, dates of birth, and loss dates were:
   _Air Force Maj. Joseph J. Karins, Jr., of Syracuse, N.Y., born
April 21, 1938, lost over North Vietnam, March 11, 1967;
   _Navy Lt. John V. McCormick, of Burt, Mich., born Dec. 12, 1939,
lost over North Vietnam, Dec. 1, 1965;
   _Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Herbert E. Smith, of Appalachicola,
Fla., born March 1, 1936, lost over North Vietnam, July 29, 1966;
   _Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Robert E. Simmons, DeRuyter, N.Y.,
born Nov. 25, 1951, lost in Laos, March 29, 1972.
   The Pentagon announcement said the remains of three of the
servicemen would leave Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, at 8 a.m. on
Monday, July 25, en route for Travis Air Force Base, Calif., ``for
their final journey home.''
   In July 1985, Vietnam announced its intention to help resolve
the issue of American POWs and MIAs within two years, and since
then has returned the remains of many Americans lost in Indochina.
   The Vietnamese allowed U.S. representatives to take part in the
joint excavation of one crash site, in November 1985, but no
remains were recovered.
   The United States is trying to account for nearly 1,800
Americans missing in action from the Vietnam war, which ended in
April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South
Vietnamese government. U.S. forces lost 58,000 soldiers during the
war.

   The Soviet Union and China have agreed to meet
in Beijing next month in an attempt to work out a peace settlement
for Vietnamese-occupied Cambodia, a U.S. official said Thursday.
   If successful, the talks could remove the remaining obstacle to
a summit meeting between the world's two biggest communist powers,
who have been at odds for some 30 years, the official said.
   This is the first time the two sides are holding a meeting with
Cambodia as the sole agenda item, although they have been
conducting periodic talks on the foreign ministry level since 1982,
the official said. The Soviets will be represented at the August
meeting by Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev and the Chinese by
foreign ministry official Zhu Qizhen, the official said.
   While neither the Soviets nor the Chinese have a direct role in
the long-running Cambodia conflict, both powers hold sway over
allies who are directly involved.
   Secretary of State George Shultz was informed of the planned
talks during his visit to Beijing last week, said the official,
speaking only on condition of anonymity.
   But he cautioned that the success of the Cambodia meeting hinges
on the upcoming ``cocktail party'' talks among the three-party
Cambodian guerrilla coalition, Vietnamese officials and the
Vietnam-appointed government in the capital of Phnom Penh.
   The talks are scheduled to begin Monday in Indonesia, but Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, former head of the Cambodian resistance movement,
is already predicting failure.
   Sihanouk, who resigned this month from the presidency of the
three-party guerrilla coalition, accused Vietnam on Thursday of
being unwilling to conduct serious talks.
   Vietnam moved into Cambodia in 1979, driving out the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge rulers who killed hundreds of thousands
of people in their bloody four-year rule. China has promised Shultz
it would seek to prevent Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot from returning
to Cambodia, the official said.
   Under pressure from Moscow, Vietnam announced in May that it
would withdraw its estimated 125,000 troops by 1990.
   The U.S. official said China had indicated to the United States
that Soviet cooperation over Cambodia would clear the way for a
rapprochement. China had also been holding out for a Soviet
withdrawal from Afghanistan, which began in May after more than
eight years of occupation.

   Two members of the striking Writers Guild of
America say they were told by the head of 20th Century Fox that a
``gentleman's agreement'' between producers and directors has
blocked a settlement of the walkout.
   According to two of 40 guild members who met Tuesday with Barry
Diller, chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Inc., Diller
said the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers agreed
privately with the Directors Guild of America last year on payments
for TV reruns.
   The two writers spoke on condition that they not be identified.
   ``He said that the producers had made a gentleman's agreement
with the DGA that they would not give the WGA a penny more for
residuals,'' one of the writers in attendance said. ``He said that
the producers felt obligated to uphold that agreement. He said, `We
cannot go back on our word to the Directors Guild.'''
   Diller would neither confirm nor deny the report.
   Glenn Gumpel, executive director of the DGA, said that he ``was
not going to contradict Barry Diller's statement.'' However, he
would not say whether the DGA had entered into such an agreement
with the producers.
   ``We don't negotiate for the WGA,'' Gumpel said. ``Writers are
entitled to ask for and negotiate for whatever they want to.''
   Cheryl Rhoden, spokeswoman for the Writers Guild, said Diller's
reported admission ``in the 20th week of the strike answers many
questions about the refusal of the alliance to negotiate.''
   ``I got tremendously uspet when I heard about Diller's
comment,'' said Del Reisman, vice president of the WGA and
co-chairman of the negotiating committee.
   ``But if such a pact existed, why didn't he talk about it
earlier? It's incredibly late in the negotiationg process to come
out with that kind of statement.''
   The WGA and the producers have been sharply divided over
payments for reruns since the strike by the 9,000 film and TV
scriptwriters began March 7.
   Union leaders have said repeatedly that the producers have been
largely unwilling to make any compromises on payments for TV shows
rebroadcast domestically and all programs shown overseas.
   The strike has resulted in sweeping layoffs throughout the
entertainment industry.
   The DGA is considered to be one of Hollywood's most potent
unions because its members, once on strike, can shut down all
television and film production. Effects from a writers' strike, on
the other hand, are felt more slowly.
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the producers' alliance, said
Diller's remarks were taken out of context.
   ``What the alliance said to the directors was that there was no
more money for residuals,'' Steinberg said. ``To give the writers
any more would destroy any credibility. They have to be
consistent.''
   ``The WGA is not going to get any more (for television
residuals) than any other union. That has been our bargaining
position from the very beginning and we have not wavered from that.
The writers don't deserve any more'' than the DGA, Steinberg said.
   Negotiators for the WGA and the producers are scheduled to meet
with each other and a federal mediator on Saturday. The talks will
be the first between the full negotiating teams since June 16.

   ``Born in the USA'' is OK in communist East
Germany.
   So is rock star Bruce Springsteen, who brought down the house
when he sang his popular tune before the country's largest-ever
gathering of rock fans.
   The Communist Party daily newspaper Neues Deutschland said
Thursday the song points out ``the senselessness of war.''
   ``Springsteen's sympathy goes out to those who must live on the
dark side of the American reality,'' the story said.
   Springsteen performed for 160,000 screaming, cheering fans
Tuesday night. Hundreds of people at the four-hour concert waved

   ``It's OK. I'm OK. I'll just sing from down here,'' she said.
   Miss Fitzgerald underwent open heart surgery in September 1986
and was treated for complications of diabetes in 1987.

learn about their craft.
   ``An actor should learn about movies,'' Ms. Braga says in the

   The Brazilian actress, who appeared in ``Dona Flor and her Two

   New York City Mayor Edward Koch wore the
Dublin lord mayor's gold chain of office for a few moments Thursday
and said he wished New York mayors had something similar.
   The heavy chain and seal was draped over Koch's shoulders by
Mayor Ben Briscoe, who was at Dublin Airport to greet his New York
counterpart on his first visit since 1982.
   ``It's the kind of chain I would hope to see mayors in New York
City have, but I don't think our people would have it,'' he said.
   Koch and Briscoe's jobs are vastly different.
   The Dublin mayor is elected by fellow city councilors, the
functions are largely ceremonial and the term is one year.
Re-election rarely occurs.
   Koch is here to join a pilgrimage led by Cardinal John O'Connor
of New York to promote peace in Northern Ireland.
   ``I am a Jewish soldier in a Christian army at this moment,'' he
said.

   ``He is being treated at home for kidney troubles and for
ailments typical of his age,'' said Franco Gozzi, spokesman of the
Ferrari racing team. ``We can't say he is in good health, but
certainly he is not in critical condition.''
   Company officials commented on Ferrari's health Thursday in
response to a Milan newspaper report that he was in serious

   Ferrari, founder and chairman of the company which makes luxury
sport cars and renowned Formula One racers, was forced to reduce
his business activities last February when he got influenza.
   Ferrari's health prevented him from meeting Pope John Paul II

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Claim on Libya Raid Made by American Defector</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Thursday denied
charges by an American who defected to the Soviet Union that the
United States targeted the French Embassy when it bombed Libya in
April 1986.
   Deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called the allegations
``ridiculous and absolutely untrue.''
   Glen Michael Souther, a former U.S. Navy intelligence specialist
who recently defected to the Soviet Union, said on Soviet
television Wednesday that he had access to secret photographs used
to plan the bombing attack on Tripoli. He said that he learned that
the French Embassy was a target several days before the raid.
   Foreign reporters who visited the bombed area after the raid saw
damage to the French Embassy in the Bin Ashur neighborhood of
Tripoli.
   A Soviet announcer charged that the embassy was targeted in
retaliation for France's refusal to allow U.S. bombers to fly over
its territory en route to Libya from bases in Britain.
   The Pentagon had no immediate comment on Souther's allegations.
   However, two days after the raid, then-Defense Secretary Caspar
W. Weinberger said that damage to the French Embassy may have been
caused by an American plane that was apparently shot down in the
raid and was not the result of the embassy being a target or near a
target.
   ``The simple correct answer is, we don't know how that (damage)
occurred,'' Weinberger said then. ``But it's a mile away from any
of the target areas and it was specifically rejected as a target
even though there's a large intelligence building right next to the
French Embassy.''
   Mrs. Oakley said U.S. diplomats have requested Soviet assistance
in arranging a meeting with Souther. Such meetings are considered
normal practice for the purpose of ensuring that a defector is
acting under his own free will.

<HEAD>ABC Might Cut Back on Republican Convention Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC might cut back its prime-time coverage of the
GOP convention in August because the Democratic National Convention
has been such a bore, ABC News President Roone Arledge said
Thursday.
   ``It might be less at the Republican convention. Depends on what
they do,'' Arledge said.
   NBC News President Lawrence K. Grossman said NBC would not cut
back on the GOP out of fairness after giving so much prime time
exposure to the Democrats, but would reassess the amount of
coverage in 1992.
   CBS, which scheduled an extra hour of coverage for Thursday,
plans to stick to the same schedule for the Republicans and defends
extensive prime time coverage in the future. ``I'd do more, not
less,'' said anchor Dan Rather.
   Ratings for convention coverage have been in a steady decline
since 1976. Ratings for this year's Democratic convention were
boosted by Jesse Jackson's appearance on Tuesday night, but overall
have been about 10 percent lower than in 1984.
   ``Regardless ratings and shares and so forth, this is a moment,
perhaps the only moment, and there are four days of it, when the
American people can get to know the political leaders,'' said CBS
News President Howard Stringer. ``Otherwise it's a minute-twenty
and sound bites.''
   But Arledge said he thinks the spectacle of a staged convention
``increases the cynicism about politics in this country,
particularly among young people who look at this and just can't
imagine that the windbags and speeches and demonstrations and
orchestrated happenings are an important part of the political
process.
   ``If the parties want to continue to do that, it's their
business, not mine. I think it's a mistake,'' Arledge said.
   Earlier this year, the networks were excited by the prospect of
contested nominations in both parties and the idea of returning to
gavel-to-gavel coverage was even discussed. But by the time the
Democrats arrived in Atlanta, there was little drama left.
   Nevertheless, all three networks devoted two hours a night of
prime time to the convention.
   As for future coverage, Arledge said, ``I think it might be less
in '92, if the situation were identical.''
   NBC's Grossman said he would cut back on coverage in New Orleans
when the GOP meets if the network had not devoted more time to the
Democrats. Vice President George Bush has the nomination sewed up,
but he hasn't yet selected a running mate.
   ``On a basic editorial judgment we would be hard put not to go
to an hour special a night summarizing the convention in New
Orleans, except for the fundamental issues of fairness and
balance,'' Grossman said.
   The networks are not constrained by law to give equal time
because the conventions are considered news events.
   As for 1992 prospects, Grossman said, ``I think the networks
will all play a role, but it would be hard to think that we would
give the same kind of coverage. We may do hourly summaries.''
   Former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, who has been covering
conventions since 1952, agrees they have become less functional.
   ``We are in the position of covering a staged entertainment, and
it turns out the parties are not nearly as good at that as they are
at politics.''
   But he did not favor cutting coverage. ``I think it's a shame
the public is not more attentive to these proceedings. The mere
gathering of these people in one hall is, I think, fascinating into
itself.''
   ``Not everything in life can be or should be made for
television. Some things are more important,'' Rather said. ``Not
everything in life can be or should made to conform to
entertainment values.''

   In rejecting his visa request, State Department deputy

privileges of residence in the United States and therefore is not
welcome in this country.
   Tunnermann, who served as both ambassador to the United States
and the OAS, denied the charges and said the administration had
exceeded its authority in expelling a diplomat accredited to the
OAS.

   Three Palestinians were killed and 16 wounded
Thursday in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, and
Jerusalem police used bulldozers to clear streets of crowds
protesting the early closing of Arab schools.
   It was the second day in a row that three Palestinians were
fatally shot and was among the worst in seven months of Palestinian
rebellion.
   At least 231 Palestinians have been killed since since the
uprising began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million who live in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel has occupied since capturing them
from Jordan and Egypt in the Middle East 1967 war. Four Israelis
also have been slain.
   Army authorities imposed curfews on about 225,000 Palestinians
in the occupied areas in an effort to end the violence and to
punish those who joined a commercial strike ordered by the
rebellion's underground leadership.
   A new directive from the underground leadership, the 22nd since
the violence began, praised Israeli Arabs in Jerusalem and
elsewhere for joining the uprising and warned against Israeli
secret agents posing as ``journalists or news agency reporters .. .
in spying and arresting people.''
   Thursday's protests stemmed from Palestinian anger over an
Israeli order to close the schools Thursday, a month early.
   They swept from Arab east Jerusalem to the West Bank cities of
Nablus, Hebron and Ramallah. Protesters burned tires, blocked roads
and hurled stones at Israeli vehicles and police.
   West Bank schools, which 300,000 Palestinian children attend,
have been closed more than four months of this academic year by
army order. Teachers wanted hold classes through the summer to make
up, but Israeli officials said schools had become centers of unrest
and ordered them closed.
   About 600 Arabs marched through the winding streets of the
open-air marketplace of Nablus, the West Bank's largest city 45
miles north of Jerusalem, chanting anti-Israeli slogans and waving
outlawed Palestinian flags.
   Soldiers opened fire and two Palestinians were killed, the army
said.
   Officials at two Nablus hospitals said 15 people were wounded,
including three 13-year-olds, and identified two of the dead as
Maher Abu Ghazaleh, 22, and Hussam Abdel Aziz, 23, both of Nablus.
   Army spokesmen said Palestinians and soldiers fought in the
Tulkarem refugee camp and the nearby village of Zinabeh.
   Officials at the Tulkarem hospital said soldiers opened fire,
killing 17-year-old Muhamad Seth and wounding another demonstrator.
   A military spokesman confirmed one Palestinian wounded and said
the army was investigating whether there were other casualties.
   Soldiers imposed curfews on Nablus, Tulkarem and Beit Sahour in
the West Bank and on the Jabaliya, Khan Yunis and Beach Camp
refugee camps in the Gaza Strip.
   At Beach Camp, soldiers fired rubber bullets to disperse
protesters, an Arab reporter said. He said a 15-year-old boy lost
an eye and nine people were injured.
   Protests in east Jerusalem began in Arab neighborhoods and on
Salah Eddin, the main commercial street across from the walled Old
City.
   Police Chief Yosef Yehudai called them ``a spontaneous eruption
of emotions over the end of the school year.'' He said 48
Palestinians were arrested.
   Arab children hurled rocks at passing cars on Salah Eddin,
smashing the windows of a police van, authorities said.
   Stones also shattered windows in an Israeli-owned bank, four
homes and a restaurant in a tourist area near the biblical Mount of
Olives. Police used bulldozers to clear streets of protesters and
stones, Israel radio reported.
   Other protests were broken up by police on horseback and riot
control troops with clubs. Soldiers overturned the carts of Arab
bread vendors in trying to clear protesters from the central bus
station.
   ``There were a lot of kids. They were chanting something and
threw many stones. I was a little afraid,'' Ahuva Schindler of Los
Angeles, a visitor to one of the homes that were stoned, said on
the radio.
   About 100 Jewish seminary students prayed for an end to the the
violence, the newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported. It said they
gathered at the grave of the 16th century rabbi Isaac Luria, known
as the ``Holy Lion,'' during a pilgrimage to the holy city of Safed
in Galilee.

   A five-month trial involving prostitution
and racketeering turned over quite a few rocks in this quiet
community, and residents haven't liked the secrets which came into
view.
   Witnesses, many of whom were granted immunity from prosecution,
told about prostitution, arson and even soliciting a killing.
   ``We have been shocked by the ugliness of this organization, how
big it was, how extensive it was,'' said Mayor Dorothy Johnson.
   The jury, selected from Racine County about 125 miles to the
south, began deliberating Thursday in the case against William
Evers. Evers, 49, who once owned massage parlors, is charged with
three counts of racketeering, 32 prostitution-related charges and
one misdemeanor theft charge.
   In closing arguments, defense attorney Eric Stearn said the
community was trying to blame Evers for all its problems.
   At a preliminary hearing in September, in fact, a judge blamed
the community.
   ``None of it would have been possible without the patronage of
the people of the Fox River Valley,'' Reserve Judge Albert Twesme
of Galesville had said. ``They are the ones who made all this
despicable behavior possible. It was they who made these activities
lucrative.''
   Twesme said he had been shocked by testimony that some of the
prostitutes were busiest after Sunday church services.
   Appleton, a community about 64,000 on the Fox River in
northeastern Wisconsin, is home to several paper companies, a
university, freshly painted homes, clean streets and plenty of
smiling faces.
   ``This is considered a family community,'' said William Welch,
president of the Fox Cities Chamber of Commerce.
   Outagamie County Assistant District Attorney John Des Jardins,
who called more than 100 witnesses and introduced nine boxes of
state exhibits, described a criminal enterprise that ran a
prostitution network in Appleton, Oshkosh and Green Bay dating back
to the late 1970s.
   Johnson and investigators pointed out that many of the patrons
of the businesses came from other areas to Appleton, which has
become a retailing center in the area.
   ``If anything, perhaps government and attitudes here are so
clean that people are so circumspect that when a problem like this
comes up, it gets more attention,'' said Welch.
   Des Jardins said prostitution was no greater a problem in the
Fox Valley than in other areas of similar size but the Evers case
may have opened peoples' eyes.
   ``It wasn't running rampant, but there was a lot more going on
that some people thought,'' the prosecutor said.
   Twesme said he did not know how it could have gone on so long in
the community.
   ``How is it able to go on in all our metropolitan area? Maybe
people look the other way, I don't know,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Johnson, mayor since 1980, said the city never turned its eyes
away and she believed it was a credit to the city that local police
and authorities pursued the case.
   She said Appleton was one of the state's fastest-growing cities
and the case described in court is ``not an unusual situation by
any means in any city that is growing.''
   Investigators first began receiving some information on the
businesses in 1980. The Appleton investigation began in late 1986
and officers over the years made arrests for ordinance violations,
said Appleton Police Lt. John Parker.
   ``It was an unusual situation for this community. We knew it was
there but we had to build our case,'' Parker said.
   ``You can keep arresting the girls and the proprietors and
managers,'' Parker added, ``but what good does it do?''

refused to elaborate.
   Sheela's release has been moved from Dec. 19 to Jan. 8, Sheldahl
said.
   She is serving a 4{-year sentence for crimes ranging from arson
and attempted murder to immigration fraud, electronic eavesdropping
and masterminding a food-poisoning outbreak that made 750 people
sick.
   Sheela pleaded guilty in 1986.
   The commune she helped run at Rajneeshpuram disbanded after
Rajneesh pleaded guilty to an immigration charge and was deported
in 1985.

   Democratic officials and delegates to the party's
40th national convention seem convinced that this week's low-drama
show of balance and unity may be just the ticket for Michael
Dukakis' fall campaign against George Bush.
   Optimism was unmistakable here as Democrats examined the
implications of the Dukakis-Bentsen-Jackson pact forged as the
convention week began.
   ``We're on the threshold of putting together one of the most
powerful coalitions in recent history,'' party chairman Paul Kirk
said Thursday.
   Throughout many of the 50 state delegations, as Dukakis-Bentsen
backers began to explore their tentative alliance with Jackson
supporters, the implications of having a moderate white Southerner
on a ticket embraced by Jesse Jackson seemed to offer attractive
possibilities.
   ``Jackson's people and Dukakis' people are now one and the
same,'' said Jackson campaign chairman Willie Brown on Thursday.
   Many delegates said they were struck by Jackson's call Tuesday
night for Democrats to find ``common ground,'' whatever their
ideological differences. He began with a salute to former President
Carter, and then brought civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks to the
stand for a salute.
   ``It takes two wings to fly,'' he said.
   That was clearly the thinking that motivated Dukakis as he
worked over the past two weeks to juggle two delicate political
deals: the addition of Bentsen to his ticket and the courtship of
Jackson and his supporters for the fall campaign.
   His success in holding together the new coalition _ in working
with both Bentsen and Jackson without alienating supporters of
either _ could be a key to Dukakis' success in a close election
(and in building the sort of party-wide base that eluded Carter
during his term of office).
   ``People come to conventions for different reasons, usually to
fight or win,'' said Illinois Attorney General Neal Hartigan, a
white party regular whose state delegation featured a sometimes
fractious racial split. ``This time you can smell it. People want
to win.''
   Following Dukakis' Wednesday night victory for the nomination,
Rep. Charles Hayes of Chicago said, ``I can't help but say my
preference is Jesse, but I'm willing to face up to what is real.''
   What is real is Bentsen, the moderate-to-conservative Texan who
was blasphemed by another Illinois congressman, Rep. Gus Savage, as
a ``white male Southern Reaganite warhawk,'' about whose nomination
``I am insulted.''
   Marching to the beat of his own drummer, Savage said that if
Dukakis wants to pander to white Southerners with the Bentsen
choice, ``tell them to get their votes from the white South.''
   That's just what more prominent black leaders said they have in
mind.
   ``The white elected officials in Alabama _ from the Senate down
to the courthouse _ need to go out and support the ticket,''
Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington said in an interview. ``They did
not do it with Mondale.''
   In a Thursday evening address, he told the convention:
   ``As we do battle this fall, take note, my friends. The enemy is
not in this hall. In this hall, we have family I am from
Birmingham. We know about strife, discord, hurt feelings, shattered
dreams, dashed hopes. But we also know about healing, rebuilding,
putting differences behind us, about yesterday's enemy being
today's ally.''
   Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston, who has seen many Democratic
presidential candidates flame out in his home state, said he sees
Bentsen attracting the ``swing vote in South Carolina _ the
independents who sometimes vote Republican and sometimes vote
Democratic.''
   That might not make the difference in a state as conservative as
Riley's, but delegates hoped it would tip the balance in a less
rock-ribbed state like the one next door.
   Even with a healthy percent of the swing white vote, Dukakis
probably cannot hope to win a state like North Carolina without a
high turnout among blacks. And so reaction like that of Lewis
Woods, a Jackson delegate from Catawba County, N.C., is important
to the Dukakis campaign.
   ``We don't forget where we came from; we've got to keep hope
alive ... but what that means now is unity in the Democratic
Party,'' Woods said.
   Sen. Terry Sanford said he expects North Carolina to be a hotly
contested ``bellwether state,'' with Bentsen and Jackson both
working for the ticket.
   The coalition Kirk is dreaming about for the fall campaign can
already be seen in another swing state, Georgia. State Sen. Al
Scott said he hopes the black-white partnership will be extended to
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who is considering a campaign for
governor. In the meantime, Scott said he was encouraged by the
positive reaction of white politicians to Jackson's convention
address and by Sen. Sam Nunn's denunciation of the South African
policy of apartheid in his remarks.
   If Bush weren't worried about all this he'd be relaxing at his
summer place in Kennebunkport instead of counter-programming the
Democrats with appearances this week in Michigan, the Carolinas,
Wisconsin and New Jersey.

   House Speaker Jim Wright's role in this week's
convention has underscored a ``Democratic sleaze factor'' that's
stifled virtually all rhetoric about Attorney General Edwin Meese,
Republican critics said Thursday.
   ``I think they have felt uncomfortable talking about sleaze when
the camera right over the shoulder of the speaker focuses on Jim
Wright,'' said Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich.
   ``I'm never happy when you're talking about which sleaze is the
greatest,'' he added, ``but I sure don't think the Democrats want
to open the door to the debate as to whose sleaze stain is
biggest.''
   Capping a weeklong GOP ``truth squad'' effort, a panel of
Republican officials launched some of their sharpest attacks on
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, and insisted that ethical
questions surrounding Meese and others in the Reagan administration
have been effectively defused by Wright's problems.
   Wright is under investigation by the House Ethics Committee over
allegations that he channeled royalties from a book of his writings
into his campaign fund and that the book was edited by a staffer on
his congressional payroll. He has rejected any suggestions of
wrongdoing.
   The Texas congressman is presiding over this week's Democratic
National Convention, despite some suggestions that he should have
stepped aside.
   Meese, who has resigned and will leave office next month, has
been the subject of two investigations over his finances and
ethics. Independent counsel James McKay, in a report filed this
week, said Meese had probably violated some tax and
conflict-of-interest laws, but said he found no grounds to indict
him.
   While Meese's name has been mentioned during the week, his legal
troubles have not been a central issue during the convention.
   Mike McCurry, spokesman for the Democratic convention, said that
in general the Democrats have steered away from highlighting
Meese's problems because ``we felt in was important to stay focused
on delivering a positive message about what Democrats would do.''
   The Republicans also worked hard to sow some divisions among the
Democratic ticket of Dukakis and Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   Vander Jagt said Dukakis has benefited throughout the primary
process because he's been running against Jesse Jackson, and that
casts him in the role of the moderate alternative.
   With the more conservative Bentsen at his side, Vander Jagt
said, voters will begin to view Dukakis as a liberal, damaging
Democratic hopes.
   ``It is Lloyd Bentsen that is going to help us turn off the
Reagan Democrats and conservative, because by comparing Bentsen's
voting record and what Dukakis is for, that paints Mike Dukakis as
the lefty, liberal that he is,'' Vander Jagt said.
   ``It is Bentsen that is our salvation,'' Vander Jagt said. ``It
has been a great convention for Republicans.''

<HEAD>Homeless End 3-Month Protest on City Hall Steps After City Offers
Help</HEAD>

   A group of homeless people agreed Thursday to end
a three-month camp-in on the steps of City Hall after the city
promised to give them an office and establish a hot line for the
homeless.
   The fledgling advocacy group, called Homefront '88, announced
the agreement along with cityofficials in the City Hall lobby.
Their bedrolls, cots and mascot dog were still outside.
   ``They have shown how groups become empowered to speak for
themselves,'' said Ann Maguire, executive director of the city's
Emergency Shelter Commission.
   Homefront '88 wants to be ``part of the rebuilding of the city
and basically backing the humanity of this city,'' said its
spokesman, John Grizz Williams, 32, originally of Durango, Colo.
   Williams, who works in demolition, and his wife moved to
Massachusetts to take shelter with her family after they were
burned out of their home and lost all their money, he said.
   ``Our goal is to one day see everybody in a house they can
afford, on their own,'' he added.
   Neil Sullivan, policy adviser to Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, blamed
the predicament of the homeless, who number an estimated 3,500 in
Boston, on Reagan administration cutbacks in public housing
construction.
   ``Homelessness did not just happen,'' Sullivan said. ``People
were cast out by the federal government since 1981.''
   Under the agreement, the city will pay six months' rent,
telephone service and supplies for an office at one of the city's
community health centers to conduct advocacy work on behalf of the
homeless.
   A homeless person will be appointed to the city's Emergency
Shelter Commission. In addition, a hot line telephone number for
homeless people to call during emergencies will be set up through
City Hall.
   For its part, Homefront '88 must prove to the city it can
establish a functional organization with officers and staff. Under
the agreement, the group also must find a developer or non-profit
housing group that will commit to planning to build affordable
housing.

<HEAD>Carter Attacks Failed Reagan Policies in Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said Thursday that
communism would have died in Nicaragua long ago had it not been for
the failed policies of the Reagan administration.
   Restoring peace and human rights to that country ``can still be
accomplished in an enlightened and competent and honest
administration,'' Carter said.
   Carter spoke at a luncheon for Hispanic and Native American
delegates to the Democratic National Convention at his new
presidential libary.
   ``We could have had peace in Nicaragua long ago, we could have
had a death of communism in Nicaragua long ago, and an enhancement
of freedom and democracy in Nicaragua long ago had the United
States government worked with our other democratic friends in this
hemisphere,'' Carter said.
   The Reagan administration has sought to undermine the Marxist
Sandinista government of Nicaragua by financing the Contra rebels.
   Carter said the United States should support democracy and human
rights, but not intrude in its neighbors' affairs.
   ``It's contrary to my philosophy for us to try to impose our own
will or to give advice to our neighbors to the south,'' he said.
``They are just as competent as are residents of my own nation to
make decisions about the future.''
   Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said Carter had conducted a far
different foreign policy in Central America than Reagan.
   ``There was a time when the United States did not mine harbors,
a time when our government did not deal with drug lords, a time
when our government did conduct foreign policy with dummy companies
and White House conspiracies,'' said Richardson.
   Carter said Jesse Jackson told him that all he wants from
Michael Dukakis is the same close relationship minority leaders
enjoyed with Carter.
   The former president said he never made a major campaign or
White House decision without consulting them. Their ``political
support was absolutely crucial to my success,'' he said.
   ``And when you arrived at the White House, you found top staff
members and members of my Cabinet who understood your problems and
would listen to your voice,'' said Carter.
   He said he now sees the same relationship evolving ``in its
initial stages at this convention. It's not a concession on the
part of Dukakis and his people. It's a great reaching out and an
additional asset to him.''
   Richardson, noting much is made of Dukakis' fluency in Spanish,
recalled that as governor of Georgia, Carter once addressed an
Organization of American States meeting in Spanish.
   Yes, laughed Carter, but ``I don't think either the Latin
contingent or the Americans could understand what I said.''

   Michael Dukakis, the methodical campaign
marathoner, accepts the presidential nomination tonight from a
newly unified Democratic Party. His top aide, acknowledging Dukakis
is still no household word, said he'll use his prime-time
television address to ``tell the American people who he is.''
   Dukakis won the nomination over Jesse Jackson in a Wednesday
night roll call that was loud and long but lacking in suspense. He
had clinched victory in a string of primary election wins in the
spring.
   A last obstacle to unity was removed today when Jackson's
supporters did not submit a petition by a 9 a.m. deadline to put
his name in nomination to challenge Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen in
tonight's vice-presidential roll call.
   ``Just Mr. Bentsen's'' petitions had been turned in, said Rick
Boylan, an aide in the convention secretary's office.
   In another sign of harmony, Jackson campaign chairman Willie
Brown, emerging from a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus,
said, ``Jackson's people and Dukakis' people are now one and the
same.''
   Meanwhile, Dukakis went to the Omni convention hall to practice
his speech at the podium. He objected at one point to a sentence
that didn't sound right. ``That's lousy,'' he told an aide who had
helped write the speech.
   Later, he made a brief appearance at a luncheon sponsored by the
Democratic National Committee and the party's Senate and House
campaign committees.
   ``As all of you know, I'm a stemwinding orator,'' he said with
self-deprecating humor. He went on to say his wife had asked to
look at his acceptance speech.
   ``I said OK and she went into the bedroom,'' he said. ``When I
went into the room myself to get my jacket, my wife was fast asleep
on the bed and the speech was beside her, half-read.''
   Campaign chairman Paul Brountas said Dukakis would use the
speech to reach out to voters.
   ``During the course of this campaign, while Governor Dukakis has
traveled extensively, probably no more than three or four or five
million people have seen him personally on television,'' Brountas
said.
   So Dukakis will use his acceptance speech to introduce himself,
``identify himself and tell the American people who he is, where he
came from, what he has done and what his vision of the future is,''
Brountas said.
   Dukakis speeches are generally low-key affairs, but Brountas
indicated there was no concern he would seem dull after the
high-energy efforts of Jackson and others at this week's Democratic
National Convention.
   ``Some people may compare, but I think Mike Dukakis has gotten
where he is by being what he is and I think that's what you'll see
tonight,'' Brountas said on CBS-TV.
   Now, just 10 days after a blowup over Dukakis' selection of
Bentsen as running mate, the convention's next order of business is
Bentsen's formal nomination and acceptance tonight, giving the
Democrats a ticket considerably less liberal than has become
customary.
   The frictions touched off by the choice of Bentsen, and by
Dukakis' failure to notify Jackson first, once threatened to raise
a Jackson challenge for second place, a job he said he wanted.
   But in the determined spirit of harmony that guided this
convention, that seemed forgotten.
   With no suspense about the outcome, the delegate tally Wednesday
night reached 2,876.25 for Dukakis to 1,218.5 for Jackson before
Jackson released his delegates to make the nomination unanimous.
   So tonight belongs to Dukakis to deliver an acceptance speech
setting the theme for his campaign to break an eight-year GOP lock
on the White House and defeat Vice President George Bush, the sure
nominee of the Republican Party.
   In the long battle of primary elections, Dukakis, the
Massachusetts governor, outlasted six other opponents and won 22 of
36 states. He promised to extend nationally the ``Massachusetts
miracle'' of economic prosperity that has blessed his home state.
   Dukakis showed little emotion when the nomination finally became
his during a late-night convention roll call Wednesday.
   ``We want Mike,'' thousands of delegates roared. They waved a
sea of signs. They would have danced if there had been room in the
narrow aisles.
   ``It's all a little bit like a play. I feel terrific,'' Dukakis
said, watching on television at a nearby hotel's penthouse with his
wife, Kitty, and family.
   He smiled and raised his fist in victory as California delegates
gave him the winning margin.
   Dukakis and Bentsen came to this convention city with a modest
lead in the polls over Bush, who calls himself the underdog. With
the intense publicity of this week, the Democrats look for a boost.
   Democrats believe Bush, unlike President Reagan, is vulnerable,
given the voters' concern over the Iran-Contra scandal and illegal
drug trafficking and what the polls say is a broad uneasiness over
the nation's economic prospects.
   Dukakis was formally nominated by fellow Gov. Bill Clinton,
whose 35-minute speech ran way beyond the 15 minutes allotted. One
of his biggest ovations came when he said, ``In closing ...''
   Clinton described Dukakis as old-fashioned, ``the kind of man
who plays it straight, keeps his word and pays his bills.''
   ``His character is steadfast and consistent,'' he said. ``He
wakes up in the same world every day, a trait of no small
importance in a president.''
   In a gesture weighted with symbolism, Jackson was put in
nomination by union chief William Winpisinger, who described him as
one ``who has ignited the passionate fires of justice in our
souls.''

<HEAD>Counties Declare Emergency Because Of Water Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two counties have declared states of
emergency because of nearly 100 complaints from people who say
agricultural irrigation has caused their residential wells to dry
up.
   One legislator said he has seen water sprayers going in the heat
of the day and sending water onto roads.
   The declarations were made by Kankakee County Board Chairman
Marwood Hendrix and Iroquois County Board Chairman Russell
Rosenboom.
   The declaration means ``the county has exhausted all of its
resources and this allows the county to get outside help,'' said
Vicki Senesac, office manager of the Kankakee County Planning
Department.
   State Sen. Jerome Joyce and state Rep. Phil Novak said the
Illinois State Water Survey would investigate the complaints about
irrigation and well failures.
   The Illinois Department of Agriculture also is to send staff
members to the area next week to determine how many high-capacity
irrigation wells there are in the two counties.
   Officials of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers went to Papineau
on Wednesday at the request of Ted Horner, Iroquois County
Emergency Services Coordinator, to see if they could help.
   Corps officials said they could transport water, but that local
governments would have to pay if new wells were drilled.
   ``One optimistic thing is that we have got the state agencies to
begin to look at these complaints,'' said Novak. ``This is becoming
a serious issue about water rights and the allocation of
underground water is becoming very serious.''
   Joyce called for a show of ``neighborliness.''
   ``Yesterday, I took a drive around Pembroke Township and over
around Papineau, and right at high noon I saw some irrigation
equipment shooting water up in the air _ the most inefficient
method at that time of day particularly,'' said Joyce. ``Also, on
the road to the Iroquois Conservation Area, you could stop in the
middle of the road and get your car washed.''

the United States. The hall rocks, one can see delegates wave their
signs, shout and cheer. He, too, is visibly happy _ but there's
really no reason he should move from his seat. After all, it's only
the next day that he will make his acceptance speech.
   ``The scene takes place in a large hotel suite, several hundred
meters (yards) from the convention: astonishing scene, scene which
would be intimate if, here like elsewhere, the television cameras
were not present, for, as always, it is an arranged scene. We will
never know how Michael Dukakis might have behaved in `true
intimacy.' ''

   Correspondent Paulo Francis of the liberal Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper of Sao Paulo said in a report from Atlanta: ``Dukakis'
ideas are good. But I confess I'm little scared, because he has so
many ideas. This almost always fouls things up. Better to be a big
healthy dope like Ronald Reagan and confuse Bolivia with Brazil
than to be a guy who insists on interfering everywhere, like
Dukakis.''
   The independent newspaper Jornal do Brasil of Rio said: ``A
campaign promise is something so sacred that it doesn't occur to
the American politician not to keep it, when assuming an executive
post. That's why the backroom negotiations between Michael Dukakis
and Jesse Jackson, before the elaboration of the candidate dukakis'
final platform, were so important. ... It is one of the greatest
demonstrations of how the mechanism of democracy works, when it is
practiced conscientiously.''

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expressed hope Thursday the next

   But an American Jewish leader said Jewish voters will reserve
judgment _ and votes _ for Dukakis until he clarifies his positions
on Israel.
   ``There should be concern not to lose the Jewish votes,'' Israel
Singer, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said on
Israel's Army radio. ``In previous elections the Jewish votes
almost always went for the Democrats, but he must worry not to lose
them.
   He said many Jewish voters are still ``waiting'' to hear from
Dukakis about Middle East issues.
   Shamir remained loyal to a pledge of neutrality in internal U.S.
political debates.
   ``America is a very large country ... and what will matter is
the administration's policy and the majority of the American public
opinion,'' he said.
   ``I hope that from this point of view, nothing will change and
relations between Israel and the United States will continue to be

   On Jesse Jackson's appearance at the convention, the

thing has not been part of any nominating convention.''
   ``It was sheer Jackson lyrics _ the kind of stuff that has
captured his public and is loaded with both anger and hope,'' said
the Bonn-based paper.
   ``Each thoughtful analysis reveals him ever more strongly as the
champion of the underdogs and underpriviledged in America.''
   The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper was
not complimentary.``Jackson was defeated just like the five other
Democratic challengers who lost to Dukakis in the primaries,'' it
said. ``Even with the weight of supporters in Atlanta, he cannot
enforce even a break in the convention's meetings if it is not the

wrote Der Bund, an independent in Bern.

Jackson has made it: he said firmly and clearly what he has always
said, and he preserved party unity.''
   The conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitung wrote of the Democratic
platform: ``The document is no longer the famous laundry list,
summarizing the causes of all Democratic interest groups and making
concrete demands. Rather, it is a paper limited to general
guidelines. Yet this effort does not seem to have turned out very
concise or powerful. (...)
   ``The Democrats now want to rebuild the nation with a national
investment strategy. To this end, they promise everything good
under the sun without listing the costs.''

   Kitty Dukakis ate lunch with homeless people
Thursday and promised to do something about their plight as a
``very active first lady'' if her husband's bid for the presidency
succeeds.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who interrupted preparations for Michael Dukakis'
coronation as the Democratic presidential nominee to eat at a
restaurant for the homeless on the fringe of the city's downtown,
also criticized President Reagan's social agenda.
   ``Homeless-ness is a national problem ... a national tragedy,''
Mrs. Dukakis said. ``We will work together, I hope, under the
leadership of President Michael S. Dukakis in January.''
   If Dukakis is elected, ``I would be a very active first lady,
involved in this issue and other issues that I feel are
important,'' she said.
   Inside the 458 Cafe, Mrs. Dukakis ate lunch at a table with two
homeless men. She was joined by Mayor Andrew Young, his wife Jean,
Mrs. Young's mother and a A.B. Short, local minister who helps run
the center.
   She selected lasagna from a menu that also offered roast beef
and tuna casserole.
   For most of the meal, Mrs. Dukakis chatted with Joey Washington,
a homeless Vietnam veteran seated across from her. Washington said
he suffered from post traumatic stress syndrome, which led to
impulsive behavior.
   Leaning across the table, Mrs. Dukakis asked whether Washington
would consider it prying if she asked him to discuss his life since
returning from Vietnam.
   He said he became disenchanted by anti-war protests, and on his
first day back in the United States ``some long-hair spit on my
shoes.''
   Mrs. Dukakis told Washington that ``even if we love our country,
we have to admit that sometimes Americans can be misguided.'' It
was not clear whether she was referring to the protests or to U.S.
policy toward Vietnam.
   About a dozen other homeless men ate in the small cafe as Mrs.
Dukakis chatted with Washington.
   Outside, she told reporters that the Reagan administration's
spending priorities had led to reductions in programs to aid the
homeless.
   ``Leadership at the federal level has to be there and it's
missing today,'' she said.

   A military judge Thursday set trial for
Aug. 22 in the court-martial of Lt. Thomas A. Torchia, officer in
charge of the Navy Rescue Swimmer School when a recruit died during
a training exercise.
   Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died in March
when he was forced back into a swimming pool after he panicked,
climbed out and screamed that he was quitting the school at
Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   Torchia, who was on the telephone in his office overlooking the
pool when Mirecki was pushed into the water, is charged with
dereliction of duty.
   The Navy had offered Torchia a chance to accept non-judicial
punishment, but he opted for the court-martial. Though a trial
gives him a chance of being exonerated, he risks up to three months
imprisonment and removal from the Navy if convicted.
   Four instructors agreed to take nonjudicial punishment of loss
of pay and rank after being charged with conspiracy to commit
battery.
   Also facing court-martial, on charges of involuntary
manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery, is Petty
Officer 2nd Class Michael Combe, one of the instructors.
   The Navy has alleged Combe forced Mirecki's head under water
just before he collapsed and died.
   At a hearing last month, a Navy psychiatrist testified Mirecki
had a phobia about being dragged under water and that fear
triggered heart failure, followed by drowning, when Mirecki was
forced under by instructors. A pathologist was uncertain whether
the recruit died from the heart attack or drowning.
   A flight surgeon had declared Mirecki unfit for the rescue
training or any other aircrew duty about a month before he died
because of his phobia, but the airman was readmitted to the school
through a series of administrative errors, witnesses said.

<TEXT>
   Democrats shouldn't assume nominee Michael
Dukakis will retain his lead among women voters because certain
opponent George Bush is about to ``become a born-again'' on
feminist issues, Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado said Thursday.
   Ms. Schroeder, who briefly pondered a run for president last
summer, told women activists that Bush has scheduled speeches
before women's groups and will begin moving to cut into a gender
gap that has found him trailing badly among women in most polls.
   If he's successful, she said, Dukakis will lose the fall
election.
   ``If George Bush bridges the gender gap, he'll win,'' Ms.
Schroeder said. ``They did it in 1984. Don't let those other folks
steal it, we can't afford it.''
   Throughout the week of the Democratic National Convention, the
women delegates and other activists have been meeting daily to
devise ways to push feminist issues and build on Dukakis' strength
among women.
   Ms. Schroeder issued a blunt warning that the stakes are
enormous and the outcome far from settled.
   ``He (Bush) is going to become a born again day-care advocate,''
Ms. Schroeder said. ``George Bush is going to try to transplant
Mike Dukakis' record onto his resume.''
   In addition, Ms. Schroeder said, Democrats who control Congress
risk losing their support among women unless they win approval for
such feminist priorities as required maternity leaves.
   ``We can't keep talking gender gap and keep voting it down,''
Ms. Scroeder said.
   Beginning with the keynote speech of the convention by Texas
Treasurer Ann Richards, Bush has been under fire from women, and
Ms. Schroeder continued the assault as the gathering neared its
end, insisting Republicans have been insensitive to women's issues.
   ``Their problem is the shortage of nannies in America,'' she
said. ``Somehow, it doesn't translate into having to live on
$10,000 per year.''

<HEAD>Rain Relieves Drought For Some Farmers, Municipal Water Still
Tight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain this week over some drought-stricken areas brought
``instant recovery'' for some hay farmers, but other crops are
still threatened and more rain is needed.
   ``Overall it has eased things a little bit. But the drought is
still in effect,'' said Alan Ringo, a hydrologist with the National
Weather Service in Cleveland. ``Those streams and reservoirs that
were low are still going to be low because for the most part, all
this rain was sucked up into the earth.''
   ``The grass will turn green, and it will help, somewhat, for the
crops. But if they had the rain two or three weeks ago it would
have been much better,'' he said.
   ``Farmers are in a much better mood than three weeks ago,'' said
Morris Bitzer, an extension specialist with the University of
Kentucky in Lexington.
   A bill to give drought-stricken Wisconsin farmers a property tax
cut of up to $1,000 was signed Thursday by Gov. Tommy Thompson.
Farmers said it would not make or break them, but it would help.
   ``It's hard. It's tough for the government to come out and
please everybody,'' said Carl Gorell, 76, who owns a 240-acre farm
at Seymour, Wis. ``They can't make it rain and that would be the
only way to do it.''
   Rainfall amounts varied widely, ranging across Ohio from 0.62
inch at Toledo since Monday morning to 5.28 inches at Cincinnati,
the weather service said. Massachusetts' Quabbin Reservoir, which
supplies 2.5 million people, including Boston, has 4.31 inches so
far this month, above the normal 3.94.
   Eastern Iowa got isolated showers Wednesday, but amounts were
one-tenth of an inch or less, while northern New Jersey got more
than 6 inches.
   Parts of Tennessee got a few inches of rain in the past week,
but as of the end of June the area was 63 inches below normal for
the past four years, which is more than a year's normal rainfall.
   The rain cooled parts of Iowa, but most of the state is still
firmly in the grip of the dfrought, said acting state climatologist
Harry Hillaker.
   ``There are certainly areas which are much better off than they
were two weeks ago, but 80-85 percent of the state is still very
much drier than usual,'' said Hillaker.
   Western Massachusetts farmers said the rain was too late for
some crops.
   ``Right now, you take what you can get,'' Scott Danner, sales
coordinator for the 66-member Pioneer Valley Growers Association,
said Thursday. ``What was lost during the dry spell is gone and
won't come back. The sweet corn had a rough time and so did the
peppers. But this will help save what is left.''
   ``Our problem now is our fields are muddy,'' said Great
Barrington, Mass., vegetable grower Daniel Tawcynski. ``But it's
either feast or famine.''
   Gary Palmer, a tobacco specialist for the University of Kentucky
College of Agriculture, said the rain did ``a tremendous job of
bringing the tobacco out of the problems it had been in.''
   He estimated the burley yield would be reduced as much as 10
percent to 15 percent, or ``maybe 150 million pounds short of the
eight-state quota'' because of the drought.
   The Kentucky-American Water Co., which serves several central
Kentucky counties, said its customers will remain on a water alert
despite increased flow of the Kentucky River.
   ``August is typically dry, and that has some bearing on our
making a decision too soon,'' said Robert Edens, company vice
president and general manager. ``The Kentucky River reacts quickly
to rain. It also reacts quickly when it is dry, and the rainfall is
not to be interpreted as a cure-all.''

   Arnold Ringgold brought 60 fur coats from
Washington, D.C. to sell to delegates at the Democratic National
Convention. He is returning to Washington with 60 fur coats.
   Akilah and Shahrazad Ali, sisters from Philadelphia, paid
$15,000 to lease 10 spaces in a hall set aside for vendors and
brought $25,000 worth of high fashion brass jewelry. They have sold
one ring for $20.
   Diane Spencer of Seattle says she's out $15,000. ``If we had had
the traffic we were promised, we would have done business,'' she
said.
   All of them are thinking about suing the Democratic National
Committee.
   ``They told us there would be 45,000 people a day,'' said Akilah
Ali. ``People spent $750 to $5,000 a space.'' After sizing up the
situation, she said, she gave up nine of her spaces and sent home
the people she had hired.
   The vendors, in the huge World Congress Center, were all but
hidden from delegates who attended the convention in The Omni arena
next door, which was next door in the same way that Fort Worth is
next door to Dallas. The area is four floors down, marked by a
small sign.
   Many of the 275 vendors have pulled out and Mark Weiner,
marketing director for the Democratic National Convention
Committee, said he refunded $100,000 in booth rental fees. The
vendors have been allowed to set up with half their staffs on
higher floors.
   Katie Young, who sells umbrellas, paid $100 for use of the
official Democrats' logo and $1,500 for a 10-by-10 foot space. She
got $750 back but she says she will seek full restitution.
   ``I thought about going to New Orleans for the Republican
Convention next month but I would not want to go into another deal
like this,'' she said. ``This is a raw deal.''
   Ringgold said he had never tried selling furs at a political
convention, but that he decided to try it because there is little
summer business anyway. He paid $1,500 for his space. On his rack
are coats priced from $675 for a rabbit fur-lined raincoat to
$5,995 for a natural female Black Glama mink, which he says sells
for $14,000 in season.
   ``I'm sorry we came,'' he said, ``but you have to spend money to
make money.''
   Ms. Ali said ``we are considering legal advice. We have
consulted an attorney to see if there is any recovery. It's a
horrible situation for a small business firm.''
   Ms. Spencer has been working conventions for three years. ``If
it's set up right, vendors can make back their expenses and make
money the first day,'' she said. ``I'm out $15,000. I have to pay
for the hotel rooms of employees, their meals, their
transportation.''
   She pointed to the furrier's booth. ``If there were people
coming by, they would have been swamped with inquiries. You'd see
women trying on coats. I haven't seen any one doing it yet.''

   A town by any other name wouldn't make it.
   A group holds a convention every year in a different city but
never anywhere but Westport. The annual World Convention of
Westports always is in one Westport or another.
   This year's was in New Zealand and next year's will be in
Massachusetts, probably in August, says Westport, Mass., Selectman
George T. Leach Jr.
   The convention of the 23 Westports around the world _ 17 in the
United States, three in Canada, and one each in Ireland, England
and New Zealand _ was the brainchild of Westport, Mo., Mayor Robert
Regan in 1983.
   It came after he visited Westport, Ireland, then invited the
Irish mayor to help his Westport celebrate its 150th anniversary.
   Previous conventions have been held in the Westports of Ireland
and New York.
   ``It's kind of a nice thing,'' Leach said of the planned meeting
in the Bay State. ``We'll get a lot of publicity.''
   The 1990 convention will be held in Westport, Conn., home to
actor Paul Newman and talk show host Phil Donahue and considered
the toniest of the Westports.

   Steve Tucker is hoping he can come up with
the ransom _ 350 pennies and Mexican beer.
   The hostage: his family's plastic pink flamingo.
   When 9-year-old Michael Tucker went to get the mail Saturday, he
found a note with it.
   The note, patched together from letters cut out of papers and
magazines, read, ``We've got the bird,'' said Steve Tucker,
Michael's father. ``Then all it said was, `We will be contacting
you soon.'''
   A pile of pink feathers was found where the 2{-foot flamingo,
purchased two weeks ago for $3.15, had been staked into the lawn.
   ``He must have put up a violent struggle,'' Tucker said
Wednesday.
   The Groups Against Gaudy Yard Art _ the kind of art that's
enough to GAGYA _ claimed responsibility for the abduction. A
spokesman for the group said the bird is unharmed.
   The next ransom note demanded the pennies and one bottle of an
exotic beer. Tucker says he's never heard of the beer _ Carta
Blanca _ and is awaiting further instructions.

   Prime-time choreography has sapped the Democratic
National Convention of its spontaneity, reducing delegates to
television props with no real deliberative role, some complained
Thursday.
   ``The whole focus has been subordinated to TV showmanship,''
said Jerry Calvert, a delegate from Bozeman, Mont. ``This
convention is much less a deliberative body than a television
extravaganza. And that's bad.''
   Calvert and others in a sampling of delegates said the unity on
display at the convention was preferable to disarray. But there was
a cost, they said, in achieving that unity and projecting it to the
nation.
   ``Just about everything is rubber-stamped,'' said Bob Madore,
from Newington, Conn. ``I feel somewhat like a prop. The stage is
set, the agenda is there, the program is established. Delegates
don't have much of a say.''
   Convention sessions are carefully planned and controlled.
Videotaped biographies break up the speeches; house lights rise and
fall to signal applause. All but two platform issues were settled
before the opening gavel.
   Ultimately, delegates said, it is the structure of modern
conventions that prevented much drama: The primary elections and
caucuses gave Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis enough votes to
prevail on whatever issue arose.
   ``Because of the nature of conventions having changed, no longer
are major matters decided,'' said Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, an
unsuccessful candidate for the nomination who is attending as a
delegate.
   ``I'm not saying it's over-choreographed. But it is
choreographed,'' he said. ``The reality is it's a huge rally.''
   As such, there is a sense of illusion in the proceedings. ``What
comes across on TV probably suggests that we are all having more
fun than we really are on the floor,'' said Linda Almy, of
Underhill, Vt. ``It's mostly genuine. But it feels staged
sometimes.''
   Despite such frustrations, delegates said they recognized value
in the convention planners' approach. ``This is much smoother, much
better run than the '84 convention,'' said state Sen. Mary Just
Skinner, also of Vermont. ``I'm pleased that it's choreographed so
well. It makes for a lot of unity.''
   Skinner noted that delegates are discussing issues of substance
at forums outside the convention hall. And several delegates said
they already had played their key roles by organizing in their
states for their candidates.
   ``I've been in involved in the process right along. When you
come here as a convention delegate, that's the just end of the big
game,'' said Jack Obenour, of Mansfield, Ohio.
   ``We're not playing around here,'' said delegate Tom Best, of
Tumwater, Wash. ``We came because we believe in the process.'
   Calvert, though critical of the emphasis on television images,
said the convention had maintained its integrity. ``The national
convention is the one place when this political party meets as an
institution, and this meeting is necessary to the organizational
vitality of the institution,'' he said. ``It's not just an
extravaganza.''
   On another level, ``It is psychologically exciting to be part of
a mass of people that share common values and goals,'' Calvert
said. ``That's worth the trip.''

   Democrats, looking ahead to the fall campaign,
called illegal narcotics trafficking ``a new kind of national
security threat,'' and said Thursday that the Reagan administration
was premature in announcing progress in the crusade for a drug-free
America.
   Members of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, meeting
on the final day of their party's national convention, accused the
Republican administration _ and GOP nominee-in-waiting George Bush
by association _ of cutting funds for drug education and
enforcement programs at the same time it announced full-scale war
against dealers.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said the administration is
seeking to cut more than $450 million for state and local drug
enforcement programs and 60 percent of the 3 million that was spent
in 1986 on drug education programs.
   The forum called for coordination between federal, state and
local governments in such areas as education, interdiction and
rehabilitation. And it declared that while Democrats might not have
all the solutions, they had the leadership necessary to ``wage a
successful war on drugs.''
   The anti-drug rhetoric resounded at the session.
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts called the widespread use and
trafficking ``a new kind of national security threat financed by
the narco-dollar.''
   ``We have a crime wave sweeping across America that is due to
one factor and one factor only _ illegal drugs,'' added DeConcini,
who presided over the forum.
   DeConcini said that while President Reagan pronounced progress
in the campaign toward a drug-free America, ``the hard fact is this
nation is outmanned, outgunned and outspent by narcotics
traffickers.''
   The participants praised Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis and runner up Jesse Jackson for their leadership on the
drug issue.
   ``Democrats should be particularly grateful to Jesse Jackson on
this issue ... which runs very, very deep for the American
people,'' said consultant John Marttila.
   He said a survey for Americans Talk Security, a group formed to
promote interest in national security affairs, said 41 percent of
the those polled considered illegal drug trafficking as the first
or second most important national security concern.
   The survey polled 6,013 registered voters between October 1987
and May 1988. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.

   Top White House aides met here
Thursday to map out what chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein said
would be an ``energetic, active last six months'' for President
Reagan's administration.
   As Reagan vacationed at his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains
north of of Santa Barbara, Duberstein and 14 other White House
officials met for three and a half hours at a Santa Barbara hotel
to discuss a wide range of issues.
   Duberstein said the president had asked him about two weeks ago
to hold the meeting.
   ``He wants a positive, energetic, active last six months of his
presidency,'' the chief of staff said.
   He said Reagan, who returns to Washington on Sunday, plans to
meet with Republican congressional leaders on Tuesday.
   One of the subjects for discussion at that meeting, he said,
will be ways to get ``as much aid as possible'' for the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Asked whether this would include military supplies of a lethal
nature, he said, ``It is something we are going to discuss with the
congressional leaders next week.''
   Duberstein said the White House also plans to push for drought
relief legislation and other domestic policy measures. He said the
officials also agreed that ``special attention'' needs to be given
to getting Senate action on 26 federal judicial nominations that
Reagan has sent to Capitol Hill.
   On the foreign policy side, he said the administration ``will be
moving forward'' toward a treaty with the Soviet Union on
intercontinental-range nuclear missiles, following up last
December's pact on intermediate- and shorter-range missiles.
   The president's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin
Powell, who attended the meeting, said in Los Angeles on Tuesday
that it is becoming less likely with each passing week that such a
treaty can be achieved during Reagan's administration.
   Duberstein said he telephoned Reagan at the ranch after the
meeting and the president told him he was anxious to ``get going''
on the agenda.
   He said the group also discussed plans for Reagan's
participation in the presidential and congressional election
campaigns.
   White House officials said Secretary of the Treasury James A.
Baker III, who is widely expected to resign to become Vice
President George Bush's presidential campaign manager, was coming
to Santa Barbara on Saturday and would fly back to Washington with
the president aboard Air Force One.
   Duberstein said Reagan has been watching ``bits and pieces'' of
the Democratic National Convention on television.

<HEAD>Vietnam Will Try to Resolve 70 Cases, Welcomes Joint Searches</HEAD>

   Vietnam said Thursay it will try to
resolve 70 priority cases of missing U.S. servicemen this year and
will carry out more joint excavations at warplane crash sites.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach made the pledges in an exchange
of letters this month with retired Gen. John W. Vessey, U.S.
presidential envoy on the issue of accounting for 1,761 Americans
still missing 13 years after the Vietnam war ended, according to a
Voice of Vietnam radio report.
   Thach ``affirms Vietnam's efforts to solve before the end of
this year 70 cases of Americans missing in action considered
priority by the U.S. side,'' said the broadcast, monitored in
Bangkok.
   ``He welcomes the U.S. side for joint efforts in seeking out and
excavating the remains of MIAs in August, September and October
this year.''
   A U.S. government statement read to reporters in Washington
said: ``We have long urged Vietnam to agree to joint activities,
such as field investigations, surveys and excavations, to expedite
the resolution of the POW-MIA issue.
   ``The Vietnamese offer is an encouraging development ... and we
look forward to greatly expanded cooperation in the coming months.
The two governments have agreed to hold planning meetings in Hanoi
July 25-28 to discuss technical aspects of implementing this
offer.''
   Vessey and Thach reached an agreement in August 1987 under which
Vietnam would speed the search for remains and the United States
would consider Vietnam's humanitarian concerns.
   Washington has sent medical teams and encouraged private
American agencies to help Vietnamese, including those disabled in
the war.
   Last August, Vessey gave Thach a list of 70 ``discrepancy
cases'' the United States considers most easily resolvable because
the Vietnamese should have information on them. Included are cases
in which there are photographs of airmen taken after they were
captured.
   Vietnam has delivered many purported MIA remains since,
including 27 sets April 6, the largest turnover since the war. Few
discrepancy cases have been resolved, however, and U.S. officials
have complained about the slow pace.
   Despite pledges to do so, Vietnam has not allowed joint
excavations since the first one, a dig in late 1985 at the site of
a B-52 bomber crash near Hanoi. U.S. officials in Bangkok say the
Vietnamese have not given a clear explanation.
   On Thursday, the radio said Thach wrote Vessey a letter July 9
urging the United States to ``seriously carry out all agreements
relating to Vietnam.''
   It said a reply received Monday welcomed the joint excavations.
According to the report, Vessey ``hoped that the cooperation
between the two countries this year will be continued and
expanded'' and said the United States ``will continue trying to
respond to Vietnam's humanitarian concerns.''
   Thach indicated previously Vietnam wants more U.S. government
aid, but Washington refuses to agree until Vietnam ends its
9-year-old occupation of Cambodia.
   The United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic ties, but
relations have improved with the recent agreements.
   Diplomats said one indication was the relative speed with which
Vietnam returned three U.S. Navy aviators it rescued after their
plane made an emergency landing July 12 in the South China Sea.
They arrived at Subic Bay naval base in the Philippines on Tuesday.
   Previously, any foreigners found in Vietnamese territorial
waters were confined for months in difficult conditions.
   The same hard bargaining continued, however. Bill Schauer, a
U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said Thursday Vietnam asked the
United States to pay all costs incurred in the rescue,
transportation and lodging of the aviators.
   ``This request is under review,'' he said.

   Thai officials expressed outrage Thursday at a
proposal that they lend sculptures to the Art Institute in exchange
for returning a historic relic the Thai government contends was
illegally removed from the country.
   ``The feeling of the people of Thailand is that it is stolen,''
said Prince Subhadradis Diskul, an expert in Thai art and
archaeology who came to Chicago to negotiate return of a
900-year-old sculpture from a temple.
   ``And they think that if it is stolen, we shouldn't have to send
anything in return,'' he added at a news conference.
   The stone sculpture at issue _ called a lintel, or crosspiece
over a door or window _ is titled ``Birth of Brahma With Reclining
Vishnu On A Makara.''
   The 2{-feet-long by 3-feet-wide lintel depicts the Hindu god
Vishnu reclining on water, and dates to Cambodia's Khmer dynasty
from 805-1250 A.D. It is the only important original piece missing
from the 10-acre Khmer temple of Phnom Rung in the northeastern
Buri Ram province near the Cambodian border.
   Following a morning meeting, Art Institute of Chicago officials
proposed a revolving-loan program that would bring to Chicago, for
at least 10 years, ancient Thai sculptures of a comparable period
and aesthetic importance.
   The prince and a delegation of Thai officials planned to take
the proposal back to their government, but he predicted it would be
rejected.
   The piece was legally purchased by a dealer in Bangkok, who sold
it to a New York dealer, who finally sold it to the Alsdorf
Foundation of Winnetka, Ill., said Art Institute spokeswoman Eileen
Harakal. It was on loan to the Art Institute from 1967 until 1983,
when the foundation made it a gift, she said.
   The Art Institute said is had no legal requirement to return the
lintel under terms of the 1970 UNESCO Agreement or the 1983 U.S.
Cultural Property Act.
   But the Art Institute proposed that three sculptures be loaned
for display over a 10-year period, with the third one returned to
Thailand ``following successful negotiation of a continuing loan
agreement'' between the two parties.
   ``But if negotiations fail at that time,'' the prince said,
``they would keep the third piece. We can agree to everything, but
they want a guarantee these negotiations would be successful. ...
This is not a loan, it is an exchange.''
   ``The agreement was designed to be vague enough so that there
would be something to work with, so that both sides would have
something they want,'' Ms. Harakal said.
   On July 4, about 30 Thai university students staged a peaceful
protest in Bangkok outside the U.S. Embassy, urging the U.S.
government to help return the ancient lintel.
   And members of the Thai Vishnu Lintel Committee have staged
similar protests outside the Art Institute in recent months. The
group scheduled another demonstration Saturday.
   ``In effect they are holding this piece for ransom,'' said
Katherine Bowie, a University of Chicago anthropologist and
committee member. ``It does not seem by any stretch of the
imagination to be right.''
   The prince said he believed his government would reject the Art
Institute proposal and simply drop the matter.
   ``We will probably put a sign at the temple where the lintel
should be so tourists _ including Americans _ will know it was
taken, that we asked to give it back,'' he concluded, ``and that
they would not.''

   A Grenada-born nurse who cared for
2-year-old Jessica McClure after she was rescued from an abandoned
well last year will remain in the United States, the woman's
attorney says.
   Mavis Felix-Walton, 37, was granted permanent resident status by
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, attorney Paul
Douglas said.
   Douglas said an appeal of a 1987 deportation order apparently
was granted sometime this year, although he received news of the
decision Tuesday.
   Ms. Felix-Walton had faced deportation because she had stayed
too long in this country.
   ``I appreciate them letting me live here in the country I
love,'' she said.
   The nurse said letters from her doctor, the nursing agency that
employs her and Jessica's parents held little sway during two years
of dealings with the immigration service.
   Ms. Felix-Walton migrated to London 20 years ago to attend
college and moved to the United States in 1984 on a worker's permit.
   After marrying in July 1985, she applied for citizenship.
Following the end of her marriage, her ex-husband withdrew his
support of the application.
   Federal law stipulates that only immediate relatives who are
U.S. citizens can lend support to such applications.
   She said she will return to England by July 30 while her U.S.
paperwork is being processed.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said Thursday he
was astonished Iran rejected face-to-face peace talks with Iraq in
favor of indirect U.N.-mediated talks to end the Persian Gulf war.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq fears U.N. peacemaking efforts
will fail despite Iran's acceptance Monday of a U.N. resolution
calling for a cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old conflict.
   Iran on Wednesday rejected a call by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz for direct talks sponsored by U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   The Iraqi news agency said Hussein stressed the U.N. resolution
was not a temporary formula for a cease-fire but part of a
framework for ending the war.
   Hussein said he was astonished Iran rejected direct talks,
adding that anyone who rejected them did not want peace but only
sought tactical gain, the report said.
   Hussein made his comments in a telephone conversation with
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Iraqi agency said. It did
not provide direct quotes from the conversation.
   Iraq has claimed Iran accepted the cease-fire resolution Monday
only to give its forces time to regroup after a series of losses on
the battlefield.
   Later in the day, Hussein chaired a meeting of the ruling
Revolution Command Council during which top leaders ``stressed the
necessity of a positive Iranian response to the Iraqi proposals,''
the Iraqi agency said.
   Iraqi proposals include direct cease-fire talks leading to
full-fledged peace talks, the clearing of the clogged Shatt-al-Arab
waterway and guarantees of free navigation including a halt to
attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.
   First Deputy Foreign Minister Wissam Zahawi told the news agency
Iran's rejection of direct peace talks ``is tantamount to rejection
of (the United Nations cease-fire measure) itself, and of the
principle of a comprehensive and lasting peace.''
   ``If the Iranians don't want to talk to Iraq, then who do they
want to talk to?'' Zahawi asked.
   A Western diplomat in Baghdad who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the Iraqis regard direct talks as ``a token of
serious purpose.''
   Iraqi officials, who accepted the U.N. resolution upon its
adoption last July, have repeatedly insisted the cease-fire must be
part of a broader plan to achieve peace.
   ``If it is clear the secretary-general is only talking about a
cease-fire, they (the Iraqis) will certainly put a stop to it,''
the Western diplomat said.
   Iraqi suspicions have been fueled by Iranian assertions that a
cease-fire would not end the war.
   Diplomats said the Iraqis have been mistrustful of Perez de
Cuellar since September of last year, when he appeared to consider
Iranian-suggested modifications to the cease-fire measure.
   ``They certainly don't trust the Iranians, they really don't
trust the secretary-general and they don't much trust the rest of
the world,'' the Western diplomat said.
   Public reaction to the Iranian announcement has been muted in
Iraq, which has suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties in the
war. Diplomats atttributed the muted reaction to skepticism that
the Iranians truly want peace.

   A small fire in an unused kitchen at the U.S.
ambassador's residence destroyed some American Indian prints and
handicrafts that were in storage for an exhibition planned in the
fall, a spokesman said Thursday.
   U.S. Embassy press attache Richard Gilbert said the fire was
detected at about 4:50 p.m. Wednesday in the kitchen of what was
previously a separate apartment within the residence but is now
used as an art gallery.
   Ambassador Jack Matlock's wife, Rebecca, had received an advance
shipment from a group in Michigan for an exhibit she plans on
American Indian art this fall, Gilbert said. He did not know the
name of the group whose works were involved.
   The prints and handicrafts were being stored in the unused
kitchen, he said.
   ``It appears that the electric stove somehow got turned on,''
Gilbert said.
   He did not know the value of the artworks ruined in the fire,
which was put out by Soviet firefighters shortly after they were
summoned to the residence known as Spaso House.
   There was no damage to the main quarters of the residence,
Gilbert said, and a dinner party Wednesday evening took place as
scheduled.

   In a unity gesture that would make Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson proud, CBS newsmen Dan Rather and Walter
Cronkite posed happily in their anchor booth at the Democratic
National Convention Thursday to show what good friends they are.
   ``The problems of the past are the past. They're gone,'' said
Cronkite, who preceded Rather as the top CBS anchor. Rather called
Cronkite a ``master broadcaster.''
   Things were not so chummy last year when Cronkite suggested
Rather should have been fired for walking off the ``CBS Evening
News'' set in Miami and causing six minutes of air silence. Recent
tell-all books about CBS News recounted how Cronkite steamed as he
stood by in a studio in Washington as Rather ignored him during the
1984 convention.
   Cronkite is renegotiating his contract with CBS after suggesting
he might be free to work for another network under a phase-out that
kicks in this fall.
   So Cronkite was invited back into the anchor booth this year to
provide commentary during the conventions. He and Rather often
chatted amiably during CBS' coverage.
   ``We would be terribly dishonest if we said that we hadn't had
communications problems in the last couple of years. But as far as
I'm concerned, that ended with our association with this event,''
said Cronkite. ``I will also say that I came into it with a certain
amount of trepidation, which perhaps Dan had, since we haven't been
in the close communication we once had in the last few years. I
feel really very warmly that we have re-established that
communication here.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Rival's Atlanta Triumph Will Be `Gone With The Wind'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Thursday
that the Democratic Party's show of unity in Atlanta for Michael
Dukakis will soon fade and ``we will remember Gone with the Wind''
about his presidential rival's convention city.
   Bush, on a campaign swing to the Carolinas on the climactic day
of the Democratic gathering, said he watched the roll call for
Dukakis' nomination Wednesday night and was impressed by the
apparent unity it reflected.
   But ``I don't know what's bubbling under the surface,'' Bush
said at a news conference opening a visit to the Carolinas.
``There's a lot of bubbling discontent on their side.''
   ``But that's got nothing to do with me,'' he continued. ``My
business is to take on Michael Dukakis.''
   ``Soon the convention will be over and we will remember `Gone
with the Wind,''' said Bush, in a sly reference to the famed Civil
War movie set in Atlanta.
   The vice president, however, praised Dukakis as a ``very good
man,'' and said he intended to watch his rival's acceptance speech
on television Thursday night.
   ``I'm going to stay plugged in,'' Bush said at the airport news
conference. Earlier, he said he missed the first two days of the
Democratic convention entirely, while he was in the midst of a
four-day fishing excursion with Treasury Secretary James Baker III.
   Bush said he expected Dukakis' acceptance speech ``to be
somewhat positive. It would a nice change of contrast with the rest
of the proceedings, I'm told.''
   The vice president, attending GOP fund-raisers here and in
Greenville, S.C., told reporters ``I'm trying to keep a relatively
low profile.''
   ``I don't think it would be good to make it look like we
frantically jump in and try to make news in the last days of the
Democratic convention,'' he said.
   His visit to the Carolinas was part of a five-day campaign swing
that began on Wednesday.
   He said he wasn't troubled by the prospect of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson campaigning around the country for the Dukakis ticket along
with the Democratic vice presidential candidate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
of Texas.
   ``Three on two?'' asked Bush. ``Those odds aren't bad.'' Bush
didn't mention that along with his own running mate, he also will
have a powerful third force _ President Reagan _ on his side.
   ``I can't wait for the debates _ Dukakis versus Bentsen. It's
going to be great,'' Bush quipped.
   He made similar remarks in Greenville, S.C., saying: ``you've
got two different stripes and three candidates. There's very
liberal and there's Lloyd Bentsen.''
   ``My responsibility is just to take on the top of the ticket,''
he said at the South Carolina stop.
   On the subject of a running mate, Bush reiterated that he still
intends to delay the announcement of his choice until the
Republican National Convention next month.
   He told reporters on his North Carolina stop that he wanted his
decision to be ``laden with suspense.''
   ``I will try to avoid the perception of game-playing'' or
selecting a candidate ``by the applause meter,'' he said.
   The vice president said on Wednesday that former rival Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan., would be ``on any list'' of potential GOP candidates.
   Bush, told that Democrats were ridiculing him at their
convention with questions like ``where was George?'' when key
Reagan administration decisions were made, said he would not
respond to such attacks.
   ``You expect the ploy, the old rhetorical shout at the
convention,'' he said. ``Just let it go.''
   At another point, as reporters pressed him on saying when Baker
would join his campaign, Bush retorted ``lighten up.''
   Administration and campaign sources have said Baker will soon
resign as treasury secretary to become Bush's campaign chairman,
probably in the first week in August.
   Bush said he would have something publicly to say on Baker's
role ``several Thursdays from now,'' reinforcing that timetable.
   Baker flew to California after the fishing trip and will return
to Washington with President Reagan, Bush confirmed.
   On another subject, the vice president said he had not yet read
the report of independent counsel James McKay on Attorney Gen.
Edwin Meese.
   However, Bush said, ``As I've said before, the Justice
Department should be beyond any perception of impropriety.''
   ``The press stories have indicated there is a perception of
impropriety (in the Meese case),'' he continued. ``That standard
would not meet the high standard I've tried to bring to public life
and which I would aspire to have in Cabinet appointees.''
   Bush previously had praised Meese for having done the ``right
thing'' in announcing he would resign.
   McKay said in a report earlier this week that Meese probably
violated tax and conflict-of-interest laws, even though no criminal
prosecution would be pursued.

   Armenians ignored activists' calls for a strike
Thursday to protest the Soviet government's rejection of their
demand to annex a region in neighboring Azerbaijan, residents and
the state-run media reported.
   The reports suggested the government, after a five-month
struggle, may be gaining the upper hand in controlling labor unrest
that has caused millions of dollars in lost production in the
southern republic of Armenia.
   However, for the third night in a row, a large crowd of
Armenians upset with the Kremlin's decision gathered Thursday in
the central square of the Armenian capital, Yerevan, after working
hours, according to one activist.
   A former leader of the annexation drive, Igor Muradyan, told The
Associated Press that ``a huge meeting'' took place with a
prominent citizen he identified as Sergo Khanzodyan railing against
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev for failing to support Armenians
on the issue.
   The telephone line went dead before Muradyan could comment
further, and repeated efforts to call to his and other Yerevan
numbers met only busy signals.
   Meanwhile, a 2-month-old strike was reported continuing in the
disputed region, Nagorno-Karabakh, whose population is mostly
Armenian.
   The national television news program Vremya broadcast footage
from Stepanakert, the region's administrative center, showing
trucks and buses standing idle, construction sites empty and
workers milling around the city.
   Vremya showed hundreds of buses and trucks parked in protest of
the decision Monday by the central leadership to keep the region
within Azerbaijan. The broadcast blamed local officials for failing
to encourage workers to return to their jobs.
   ``The people are embittered,'' said a worker with the
Gostelradio state broadcasting authority in Stepanakert. ``We don't
know what to do. But we know that the refusal to make
Nagorno-Karabakh part of Armenia wasn't just.''
   A correspondent for the official Soviet news agency Tass in
Yerevan said the call for a strike beginning Thursday went largely
unheeded.
   ``The majority of enterprises are working. It's a normal working
day,'' said the journalist, who declined to give his name. Pressed
to say whether anyone was striking, he conceded, ``Some enterprises
are not working fully.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev told reporters at a
briefing that industries in Armenia were nearly back to normal.
   Khovik Vasilyan, an Armenian activist, said the strike call had
no noticeable effect in Yerevan.
   ``The city today is working. Factories are in operation, and
mass transit is running,'' Vasilyan, a former political prisoner,
said in a telephone interview.
   In a dispatch from Yerevan, a city of 1.1 million residents,
Tass said that since Monday, ``more and more industrial enterprises
of Armenia have begun to work at a normal pace.''
   ``Those who did not work or didn't work at their full capacity
are returning to their jobs in Yerevan, Kirovakan and other
cities,'' Tass said.
   Armenians rallied Tuesday and Wednesday in Yerevan to show their
displeasure with the Soviet leadership's decision.
   On Monday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, with Gorbachev's
blessing, ruled that transferring Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia would
violate the Soviet Constitution, because Azerbaijan had objected to
the move.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been part of the predominantly Moslem
republic of Azerbaijan for 65 years, and Azerbaijani leaders had
vetoed the region's decision to secede.
   Armenians, most of whom are Christians, make up three-quarters
of the 160,000 people of the contested region, and they contend
that Azerbaijanis discriminate against them.
   The annexation movement began in February after central
authorities rejected an initial appeal from Nagorno-Karabakh.
Strikes and mass demonstrations have plagued the region since then,
at times triggering violence, such as the Feb. 28 riot in the
Azerbaijani port of Sumgait in which 32 people were killed.
   There was no word Thursday on the fate of Paruyr Ayrikyan, an
Armenian nationalist.
   Tass said Wednesday he was being deported for ``active
instigation to inter-ethnic strife.'' Ayrikyan, 39, was arrested
March 25 and charged with defaming the Soviet state.
   Perfilyev told reporters he believed Ayrikyan was still in the
Soviet Union but had received an invitation from a foreign country
he did not identify.
   Speaking in Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley criticized the arrest and expulsion order but had no comment
on the territorial dispute.
   Asked if Ayrikyan was applying for admission to the United
States, Mrs. Oakley said, ``We cannot confirm that Mr. Ayrikyan
wishes to settle in the United States. Should he request to come
here we would review his request sympathetically.''
   However, a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said
Soviet officials had contacted the U.S. Embassy about the
possibility of resettling Ayrikyan in the United States, where he
has relatives.

   Taking a cue from heart surgeons,
engineers are considering a thin tube with an expandable balloon on
the end to plug a leak that threatens a long delay of the next
space shuttle mission.
   To work, the device would have to follow a ``tortuous path'' 20
feet through a one-half inch line that contains six sharp bends.
   It would be something like a medical procedure known as an
angioplasty, but instead of opening a clogged artery, it would
close off the leaking line.
   This approach is just one of several being weighed to fix the
small leak on the launch pad and avoid rolling Discovery back to a
hangar for repairs, which could delay the planned early September
launch by as much as two months.
   A decision on moving Discovery is not expected until after a
test-firing of the shuttle's three main engines on the pad. That
test is set for July 28, but officials said Thursday preparations
were behind schedule and it might have to be postponed a day or two.
   The leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas is in a fitting on an engine
compartment vent line leading to an oxidizer tank. It is six feet
from the nearest access panel and thus inaccessible for normal
repairs.
   ``We've got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to
do,'' said Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space
Center. The odds, he said, are 50-50 on a rollback of Discovery.
   The three main NASA centers involved with the shuttle are
working on different approaches to fixing the leak on the pad.
   At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the focus is on entering
the shuttle's cargo bay and cutting holes through both the rear of
the bay and the engine compartment to reach the leak, then plug it
by some method, including encapsulating it with a clamshell-like
device filled with a sealant.
   The Kennedy Space Center is considering ways of reaching and
sealing off the leak through the engine compartment access panel.
   At the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., the
materials and processing lab is devising a mockup of the 20-foot
line to test the ``angioplasty'' approach.
   Lab director Bob Schwinghamer said two heads are being developed
for the ``snake.''
   ``The snake with the balloon on the end would have to run
through this tortuous path like an angioplasty procedure,'' he
said. ``The balloon would be filled with an epoxy and when it
reached the leak it would be expanded. We would leave pressure on
the line until the expoxy cured. Then we could extract the snake or
leave it there.''
   He said leaving the snake-tube would cause no problem because
the line is no longer needed. It's sole purpose is to vent excess
air when the nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer tank is being filled. The
tank already has been filled and the tiny leak has allowed only a
small amount of the gas to escape.
   Schwinghamer said the balloon material would have to be
something like teflon or allrez to be compatible with the leaking
nitrogen tetroxide gas. The escaped gas can cause a problem if it
mixes with moisture in the air, forming corrosive nitric acid.
   Schwinghamer said a second approach would be to fit the head of
the tube with a tiny string of beads to ease its course through the
vent line. ``At the appropriate location, we would inject a sealant
through the hollow tube,'' he said.
   Engineers hope to be able to start testing all suggested
approaches by this weekend.
   Discovery, with a crew of five astronauts, is to make the first
shuttle flight since Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing
the crew of seven.

<TEXT>
   The State Bar says it is investigating
attorney E. Robert Wallach's activities involving the Wedtech Corp.
and Attorney General Edwin Meese III, as well as Meese himself.
   At the same time, an inquiry into whether Wallach and a former
partner charged excessive fees in two civil suits has been closed
without any accusations of improper conduct, bar spokeswoman Anne
Charles said Wednesday.
   Indepenent counsel James McKay ruled out criminal charges
against Meese, but concluded the attorney general had probably
violated criminal laws on income taxes and conflicts of interest.
The report also questioned some of Meese's actions on behalf of
Wallach in connection with Wedtech, a collapsed New York military
contractor, and a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline plan.
   The bar already has said it has asked for a copy of the report
to investigate whether Meese, who is licensed to practice law in
California, violated any ethical standards for lawyers.
   Meese also faces an inquiry by the Justice Department's Office
of Professional Responsibility. The OPR is expected to use McKay's
report as a basis for determining whether Meese may have violated
ethical standards for officials in the executive branch of
government.
   Wallach has been indicted in New York on federal charges that he
defrauded Wedtech by accepting $1.3 million for purported legal
work that actually paid for his efforts to influence Meese and his
promises of favors in a future government job that never
materialized. He has denied the accusations.
   The concluded investigation into Wallach's legal fees involved
an attempt by Wallach and former partner David Baum to collect $1
million from a $1.73 million settlement in San Francisco for two
burn victims, and $862,000 in fees and expenses they collected from
a $2.2 settlement in Sacramento. In both cases the fees were
approved by judges.

<HEAD>Clinton Concedes Speech Bombs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton conceded Thursday that
his nominating speech for Michael Dukakis bombed, but he said the
Dukakis campaign wanted him to give a serious address.
   Clinton said he cleared the 19-page address with Dukakis and his
top aides before he delivered it Wednesday, and, ``They loved it.''
   ``They even added some things to the speech. They said, `This
really makes the case for a Mike Dukakis candidacy,''' said Clinton.
   ``They wanted Ann Richards to be funny, then for me to present
the serious case for Dukakis,'' Clinton said outside the convention
hall. Richards, Texas treasurer, delivered the keynote address on
Monday night.
   Clinton said when he got up to the podium Wednesday night, he
realized the placard-waving crowd, full of pent-up emotion after
two days of a convention dominated by Jesse Jackson, did not want
to hear a solemn address.
   ``I just fell on my sword. It was a comedy of errors, one of
those fluky things,'' said Clinton. He acknowledged it was ``a bust
in the hall.''
   Clinton's talk ran 35 minutes, more than twice the allotted
time. Delegates shouted ``Wrap it up!'' and drew fingers across
their throats. They saved their loudest cheer for when he began,
``In closing ... ''
   Clinton ignored a flashing red light on the podium. At one
point, House Speaker Jim Wright edged close to urge him to finish.
   ``The yellers took half my speech time,'' Clinton complained.
   Television anchors made Clinton the butt of wisecracks. A Cable
News Network anchor ended an interview with him Thursday with the
jibe, ``A flashing red light is here. We've got to stop now.''
   Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the Democratic party, said the
speech was ``clearly longer than we had anticipated.'' Clinton
apparently revised the speech up until the last moment, McCurry
said.
   ``I guess, should I say, revisions or additions?'' McCurry
added. But he defended the speech as a worthy endeavor because it
``laid before the convention a great deal of information it was
important to have on the record.''

   The U.N. representatives prepared to
mediate cease-fire talks and investigate prisoners of war in the
Iran-Iraq conflict Thursday, but Iraq said it was wary of Iran's
motive in refusing direct negotiations.
   In Tehran, Iranian Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said
Thursday he wept while listening to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
statement reluctantly accepting a U.N. cease-fire resolution,
official Tehran radio reported.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported one
civilian died and two were injured Thursday by Iraqi shells falling
on the village of Sardasht in northwestern Iran.
   The Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi forces launched a series of
attacks on Iranian troops in northern Iraq, ``purging Iraqi border
peaks of the filth of enemies.''
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said an eight-member team of
military observers assembled in Jerusalem and Vienna will mediate
cease-fire talks and a second group being assembled in Geneva will
look into the prisoner of war situation.
   The second team ``will endeavor to ascertain the facts and
inquire into the concerns expressed by the two governments with a
view to ensuring observance of relevant rules of international
humanitarian law,'' Giuliani said.
   Both teams were expected to begin their trip over the weekend,
going first to Tehran and then Baghdad, he said.
   U.N. officials said most of the military observers being sent to
mediate come from the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization, based in
Jerusalem, and will be led by Norwegian Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced
Wednesday that U.N. observers would travel to the warring nations
to help implement the U.N. resolution passed one year ago but not
accepted by Iran until Monday.
   U.N. Resolution 598, aimed at ending the nearly 8-year-old war,
calls for an immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a
peace plan to end the war, including the return of captured
soldiers.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he was
astonished Iran rejected face-to-face peace talks, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported.
   The agency quoted Hussein as telling Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi in a telephone conversation that anyone who rejected direct
talks did not want peace and sought tactical gain.
   Iraq has claimed Iran accepted the cease-fire call only to give
its forces time to regroup after a series of losses in the war.
   Iran on Wednesday rejected a call by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz for direct U.N.-sponsored talks on ending the war.
   Rafsanjani, also commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, was
quoted as saying Thursday that Iranians should not ask too many
questions about the decision.
   ``We should not ask why and how, not create more problems for
our society,'' Tehran radio quoted him as saying.
   Rafsanjani said Iranians would come to accept Khomeini's change
of heart in accepting the cease-fire resolution, the radio reported.
   Until this week, Khomeini was adamantly opposed to ending the
war with Iraq until Hussein was driven from power. The war, which
has killed and wounded an estimated 1 million people, began in
September 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran after several border
skirmishes.
   In a statement Wednesday, the 87-year-old Khomeini stressed how
difficult it was for him to accept the cease-fire resolution.
   ``I shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more
deadly to me than poison, but I am happy to submit to God's will
and drank this cup for his satisfaction,'' the revolutionary
patriarch said.
   Khomeini's turnaround appeared to be influenced by Rafsanjani,
who introduced a less bellicose tone to Iran's war policy when he
took over as commander-in-chief last month.
   While fully backing the war effort, Rafsanjani, 53, has
consistently advocated diplomatic efforts to end the conflict and
has pushed for forging links to the West. Analysts believe he is
the man most likely to hold temporal power when Khomeini dies.
   Rafsanjani called Khomeini's decision a ``great sign of Imam
Khomeini's soul and health,'' adding he wept while listening to the
message.
   Also Thursday, four more bodies from the Iran Air jetliner shot
down July 3 by the U.S. Navy were recovered, bringing the total of
recovered bodies to 186, Tehran radio reported. A total of 290 were
killed in the incident.
   The radio said Iran obtained the equipment needed to search for
the ``black box'' flight recorder and ``a serious effort for
finding the box will soon be started in the Persian Gulf.''
   A letter was on its way to the USS Vincennes, the ship that
downed the Iranian plane, bearing nearly 10,000 signatures
expressing support for the officers and crew, U.S. Navy officials
said.
   The letter weighs 50 pounds and is 570 feet long _ four feet
longer than the cruiser itself. It originated in San Diego, Calif.,
home port of the Vincennes.
   The Vincennes ``returned to duty'' overnight, a U.S. Navy
spokesman said. It had been in port for 15 days while a team of
U.S. military experts investigated the July 3 incident.

   Euterpe Dukakis on Thursday called her son
Michael a ``wonderful role model'' for immigrants and their
families and said his acceptance of the Democratic presidential
nomination was a reminder that ``they too can live the American
dream.''
   The 84-year-old immigrant mother of the Massachusetts governor
said his crowning as the party's candidate capped his ``brilliant
career'' and added quietly, ``I hope God continues to shine down on
him so lovingly.''
   Dukakis has made his Greek heritage a central theme and almost
always includes in his speeches a reference to his mother and late
father, both of whom came to the United States from Greece in the
early 1900s.
   ``What a wonderful role model he will be for the children of the
generations of other people who have come to this country,'' Mrs.
Dukakis said in an interview hours before her son accepted the
nomination. ``Michael has shown that they don't have to wait to
become leaders of this country. Michael has shown that they have
the means, that they too can live the American dream.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, who was an active campaigner during the primary
season, said it had been an ``awesome, wonderful experience. I've
had marvelous times meeting so many wonderful people and learning
the geography of our country going from the Atlantic shore to the
Pacific shore.''
   She said that Wednesday night, when the California delegation
cast its votes to put Dukakis over the top for the nomination, he
turned to her and whispered in her ear.
   ``He said, `Well, mother, here it is,' and I said
congratulations,'' she said.

<HEAD>FCC Cracks Down On Satellite TV Pirates</HEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Communications Commission is
cracking down on television pirates who market illegal descrambling
devices for backyard satellite dishes, the agency's chairman said
Thursday.
   ``We will put them out of business and, if we can, put them in
jail,'' Dennis Patrick told a news conference. ``We're putting the
public on notice that we will no longer look the other way.''
   Patrick said the FCC is sending warning letters to 19 firms that
the FCC believes sell the technology that enables a dish owner to
decode the scrambled signals used by premium program services like
Home Box Office and Showtime.
   Using such illegal devices allows a dish owner to receive the
broadcasts without having to pay the fees charged by the
programmers or the cable firms authorized to retransmit their
signals.
   Patrick said he was unable to say how many illegal descramblers
are in use around the country, but he said their use is increasing
and some estimates put the number at as many as half of all the
units sold.
   The letters pointed out that sale and use of illegal
descramblers is prohibited by both the Federal Communications Act
and the U.S. Criminal Code. They warned of FCC fines and possible
criminal prosecution for any continued illegal activity.
   ``We strongly encourage you to discontinue selling this
technology immediately,'' the letters said.
   Patrick said signal piracy not only hurts programmers but also
the public because it increases the cost of programming,
discourages new programmers from entering the market and could lead
existing cable services to refuse to sell their signals to dish
owners.
   ``This market may dry up in the long run if we cannot stamp out
piracy,'' said Patrick. He declined to predict whether an end to
piracy would lead cable services to lower the prices they charge
dish owners.
   The FCC said it sent letters to Testron, Floral Park, N.Y.; D.B.
Systems, Glencoe, Ontario, Canada; RJL Marketing, Turks and Caicos
Islands, British West Indies; Satellite TV, Muncie, Ind.; V.C.
Bytes, Anthony, Fla.; Sports Scheduling, Fargo, N.D.; and Hinks,

   The George Bush for President Campaign said
Thursday that it had settled a complaint lodged against it with the
Federal Election Commission in early 1986.
   The complaint, filed by Howard Phillips, chairman of the
Conservative Caucus, charged that the Bush organization had
violated campaign law in connection with a public opinion poll
taken by the Republican National Committee.
   The poll, which also drew criticism from some of Bush's
then-potential rivals for the Republican presidential nomination
this year, asked 1,500 people in September 1985 how they viewed
Bush as a candidate for 1988.
   Ede Holiday, chief counsel and financial director of the Bush
campaign, said that while the campaign continues to maintain that
no law was violated, it had agreed to pay $17,610 of the $70,000
cost of the poll.
   ``We have agreed to pay for a portion of that poll to resolve
any question about the matter,'' Holiday said in a prepared
statement announcing the settlement.

<HEAD>President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe Receives Leadership Prize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EUN SHIN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe was
awarded the 1988 Africa Prize for Leadership for shepherding his
multi-racial people through independence and early statehood,
officials announced Thursday.
   Speaking in a global teleconference from Lusaka, the capital of
Zambia, and the United Nations in New York, prize jury chairman
Bradford Morse described Mugabe as one of the intellectual giants
of the African continent.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia spoke about Mugabe, an old
friend, calling him a ``truly gallant freedom fighter.''
   Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo led the black independence struggle in
Zimbabwe, a southern African nation previously known as Rhodesia.
Mugabe fought Prime Minister Ian Smith's white-ruled government,
which broke away from Britain with a unilateral declaration of
independence in 1965.
   A British-mediated accord ushered in a cease-fire and elections
that established black majority rule in 1979. Mugabe became prime
minister in 1980 and invited the white minority to join in national
reconstruction. He became president in 1987.
   Morse singled out Mugabe's approach of reconciliation with the
white minority, including Smith, and with Nkomo, who until this
year led a rival political party. Such moves provide examples of
Mugabe's visionary approach to political leadership, Morse said.
   Under Mugabe, black peasant farmers increased their crop
revenues tenfold since 1980, according to Morse, who coordinated
famine relief as former administator of the U.N. Development
Program. At the same time, the black farmers increased their share
of the nation's farm production from 10 percent to 64 percent.
Morse said peasant farmers in Zimbabwe now receive 18 times more
farms loans than they did in 1979.
   The award ceremony is scheduled for Sept. 15 in New York. The
prize consists of $100,000 to be used to promote the winner's work
on behalf of the people of Africa and a sculpture by artist
Takenobu Igarashi.
   The Africa Prize For Leadership award was instituted two years
ago by the New York-based non-profit organization, The Hunger
Project. About 5.4 million volunteers and staff in 152 nations are
helping the Hunger Project try to abolish hunger worldwide,
organizers said.
   In the first award ceremony last year, President Abdou Diouf of
Senegal and professor Thomas R. Odhiambo of Kenya, a specialist in
insect studies, received prizes.

<TEXT>
   Cartoonist and magazine editor Mark Boxer, whose
barbed depictions of the fads and foibles of middle-class
trend-setters entertained Britain for 20 years, has died, his
family announced Thursday. He was 57.
   Boxer died Wednesday of a brain tumor at his home in London
after a five-month illness.
   From 1968 until this year, Boxer's cartoons appeared in a
variety of newspapers and magazines including The Times of London,
The Guardian, The Observer, The Daily Telegraph, The Listener and
the New Statesman.
   Drawing under the name Marc, he chose as targets people in
television, newspapers, advertising and publishing; real estate
agents; interior designers, and a host of other upwardly mobile
professionals. His cartoons always were the width of a single
newspaper column.
   ``He invented ... the north London world of TV producers,
reviewers and dons (university academics) not averse to publicity
and the beau monde,'' The Daily Telegraph said. ``He had no
affection for the characters he created. His couple Simon and
Joanna Stringalong ... poisoned life.
   ``Joanna was cowardly (and) had no friends. ... Simon went in
for every trendy cause and dropped each when it was no longer
fashionable. All they wanted was to be in with those who mattered
in the media world.''
   The Times wrote: ``Marc drew ... the trendies and the
publishers, the Hampstead (in north London) intellectuals,
lecturers, teachers and politicians, the mini-skirted and student
rebels. ... He was hawk-eyed to spot a trend.''
   In 1975, when wealthy Arabs were buying up expensive London real
estate, Boxer depicted a real estate agent telling his secretary:
``Change the line about `facing south' to `facing east.'''
   Britons like homes facing south, in order to catch the sun, but
Arabs and other Moslems face east to Mecca to pray three times a
day.
   Boxer was born May 19, 1931, and his father was an army colonel.
He went to Cambridge University but was suspended for publishing a
poem considered blasphemous. As a stunt, he left in a hearse
accompanied by friends as mourners.
   He returned at the end of the brief suspension, but student life
bored him and he left without a degree.
   After a short stint with the Sunday Express newspaper, he joined
the Ambassador, a fashion export magazine, and began drawing for
the fashion and society magazine Tatler.
   In 1957, he became art editor at another fashion and society
magazine, Queen, and from 1962-65 edited the magazine section of
the Sunday Times.
   Employing big names like painter David Hockney and photographer

<HEAD>Beaches Closed Again In Monmouth County, But Pollution Source
Identified</HEAD>

   The likely source of pollution that
has plagued four New Jersey seashore communities since last week is
the Asbury Park sewage treatment plant, health officials said
Thursday.
   Beaches in Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, Bradley Beach and
Avon-by-the-Sea were closed again Thursday after tests showed high
levels of coliform, or fecal bacteria, in the ocean.
   The first beach closings occurred June 13, and Monmouth County
health officials initially pointed to polluted Sylvan Lake, which
empties into the ocean. But health officials realized the lake
would not be the source of balls of grease that had washed ashore.
Such pollution is commonly associated with sewerage plants.
   The county received state Department of Environmental Protection
assistance, and investigators checked all local sewerage plants and
pumping stations, chlorinated nearby lakes and looked at local
rivers.
   Meantime, the bacteria slowly dissipated and beaches reopened.
By Wednesday, all but four blocks in Asbury Park were reopened to
swimmers, said Myron LaVake, environmental program administrator
for the Monmouth County Health Department.
   Then on Wednesday night, as part of their investigation, county
and state health officials monitored operations at the sewage
treatment plants in Asbury Park and Neptune.
   The team discovered the Asbury Park plant ``was inefficiently
operating during the night,'' Monmouth County spokesman Paul Ridner
said. ``During the day it seemed to be fine.''
   Apparently, tides washed away most of the pollutants by the time
health officials took tests each morning, prompting beaches to
slowly reopen, said Lester Jargowsky, Monmouth County health
officer.
   The coliform sometimes reached more than eight times the state
standard, which is 200 colonies per 100 milliliters of water, he
said.
   Officials in the four affected seashore communities, meanwhile,
lamented the loss of business since the pollution closings began.
   ``Business has been absolutely brutal in Ocean Grove this past
week,'' said beach manager August G. Stoll.

   Loretta Lynn, ``the coal miner's
daughter,'' and Roy Rogers, ``the king of the cowboys,'' were among
10 finalists named Thursday for the Country Music Hall of Fame.
   Two people will be selected from the finalists and they will be
named Oct. 10 during the Country Music Association's nationally
televised awards show. The inductees will bring the hall of fame
members' total to 48.
   Joining Miss Lynn as finalists in the open category for
induction were singers and humorists Homer and Jethro, singer
Bradley Kincaid, singer Ray Price and singer Hank Thompson.
   Besides Rogers, those chosen in a category to honor those active
30 years ago were Bill Carlisle, the Louvin Brothers, the
Jordanaires and Cindy Walker, all singers.
   A panel of 200 music industry representatives will pick one from
each category.
   Miss Lynn overcame an impoverished childhood in Kentucky to
become a top country music star in the 1960s. Her autobiography was
made into a 1980 movie, ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' starring Sissy
Spacek, who won an Academy Award for best actress.
   Roger was a member of a country music group, the Sons of the
Pioneers, before becoming a movie and television star. The group
was famous for the songs ``Cool, Cool Water'' and ``Tumbling
Tumbleweeds.''
   The Country Music Association also announced 10 finalists for
its Horizon Award, an honor that goes to a rising performer who
previously hasn't won an association award.
   The 10 are Rodney Crowell, Foster and Lloyd, Nanci Griffith,
Highway 101, David Lynn Jones, Patty Lovelace, Lyle Lovett, K.T.
Oslin, Ricky Van Shelton and Sweethearts of the Rodeo.
   The list will be trimmed to five Aug. 18 when finalists for
other annual association awards are announced. Those categories
include entertainer of the year, male vocalist of the year and
female vocalist of the year.

<HEAD>NY Delegation Calls on Party to Work to Free Hostages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's Democratic delegation called on the
national party Thursday to work for the release of nine Americans
held hostage in Lebanon.
   The resolution was pushed by delegates for Jesse Jackson, who
this week raised the possibility that he might renew efforts to
free the hostages now that the Iranians have agreed to accept a
cease fire in the war with Iraq.
   New Yorkers acted on the resolution because Terry Anderson, the
longest-held American hostage, grew up in Batavia, N.Y., according
to Joyce Burns, an alternate delegate from Orchard Park.
   Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent,
was seized by gunmen in Beirut in March 1985.
   The resolution asks the convention ``to bring the plight of the
American hostages before the American people.''
   Should Michael Dukakis be elected president in November, the
resolution asks that his administration ``have as a priority
freedom for all present hostages and a commitment to positive
responses to conflicts among people.''
   Burns said there was not enough time to arrange for speakers to
mention the hostages on the convention podium, but some New York
delegates brought placards to the floor of The Omni arena Thursday
night saying: ``Bring Our Hostages Home From Lebanon Now.''
   Other delegates sported yellow ribbons to remember the hostages.
   In the past Jackson has met with leaders and ambassadors from
Middle Eastern countries in an attempt to win freedom for the
Americans held in Lebanon.
   He said on Monday that he may renew intense efforts to free the
hostages, who are thought to be held by pro-Iranian Lebanese
Shiites. Jackson made an appeal on behalf of Anderson and the other
hostages in his speech to the convention Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
   Two unexploded pipe bombs were found
lying in a street here, officials said Thursday, while a bomb scare
in a nearby town has prompted authorities to seal all mailboxes
until further notice.
   The bombs found in Wellesley were similar to four that exploded
in neighboring Needham. No injuries were reported, but authorities
said there was a close call for a jogger as one of the bombs blew
up in a newspaper vending box.
   A resident spotted the first Wellesley bomb lying in the street
Wednesday night. State police told Wellesley officers the bombs in
Needham had been found in pairs, so the area was searched and a
second bomb was found about 30 yards away.
   In Needham, two pipe bombs exploded minutes apart Sunday night,
one on a curb near the police and fire departments' building and
the other in a parking lot nearby.
   A third bomb exploded Tuesday night in a newspaper box outside
the Needham Public Library, said Needham police Lt. Thomas Leary.
   ``The bomb that exploded in front of the public library went off
just 15 seconds after a woman jogger had passed by the newspaper
box,'' said Joseph Sainato, senior explosives technician with the
state police. ``If it had gone off when she was in front of it, it
would have cut her to shreds.''
   About two hours after Tuesday's explosion, a postal employee
found a pipe bomb in a mail deposit box outside a post office.
   The bomb was ``as powerful as a military grenade ... (and) could
send 10 pieces of shrapnel flying off at 6,000 feet a second,''
Sainato said.
   Leary would not comment on whether authorities had received any
threatening messages related to the bombs.
   The four bombs in Needham were made of the same materials,
leading investigators to believe they are connected, said Detective
Trooper Michael Cherven, who is assigned to the state fire
marshal's office.

   Republican officials noting the seating
shortage at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta say they
are considering opening their bash to the general public.
   They can consider that option because the Republican National
Convention next month will be held in the spacious Louisiana
Superdome, which will have room for an estimated 40,000
conventioneers.
   In Atlanta, Democrats held their convention this week at The
Omni, which _ after construction of an elaborate made-for-TV podium
_ could hold only about 11,000 people. More than 4,000 delegates
and 13,000 reporters attended the four-day convention, which ended
Thursday.
   When the Republicans assemble in New Orleans Aug. 15-18, there
should be some seats left over, said Nadine Wong, a convention
management spokeswoman.
   Wong said she expects about 30,000 people _ delegates, reporters
and guests _ to attend the four-day event.
   Convention officials are looking for a way to parcel out the
empty seats and still maintain security.
   One idea under consideration is offering tickets to the public.
Wong wouldn't speculate on how the tickets might be distributed. A
decision should be made next week, she said.

   Here are excerpts from the prepared text of
Thursday night's speech by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the
Democratic nominee for vice president.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight years ago, our party nominated a president from
Massachusetts and a vice president from Texas. The Texan on that
ticket was Lyndon Baines Johnson. Lyndon Johnson knew then what you
and I know so well today. Equality of opportunity is the ultimate
civil right.
   His vision and his victories paved the way for Democratic
leaders like the Rev. Jesse Jackson whose eloquence, whose
leadership and achievements transcend pride of party and inspire a
nation. ...
   Democrats agree that a good job at a fair wage is the passport
to opportunity in America.
   Democrats agree that America needs a trade policy based on the
simple premise of fairness. We demand that nations selling goods
freely in our country must allow America equal access to their
markets.
   Democrats agree that the economic, trade, and energy policies of
the Reagan-Bush administration have devastated vast areas of
America. We see an agricultural economy that has been driven to its
knees: We see the energy economy reeling in crisis. We see the loss
of more than a million high-paying jobs in manufacturing.
   Democrats agree that the American worker who has struggled for
20 years to support his or her family, has earned 60 days notice if
management decides to shut down that plant.
   But the Reagan-Bush administration insists that a pink slip in
the mail is notice enough. ...
   Democrats want a strong national defense, and we will pay the
price to defend freedom. But we also demand a careful accounting of
our hard-earned dollars. We will not tolerate the corruption and
greed that threatens to undermine our military might. ...
   My friends, America has just passed through the ultimate epoch
of illusion: An eight-year coma in which slogans were confused with
solutions and rhetoric passed for reality; a time when America
tried to borrow its way to prosperity and became the largest debtor
nation in the history of mankind; when the Reagan-Bush
administration gave lip service to progress while fighting a
frantic, losing battle to turn back the clock on civil rights and
equal opportunity; a time of tough talk on foreign policy amid
strange tales of double-dealing Swiss bank accounts, and a botched
campaign against a drug-running tinhorn dictator. ...
   My fellow Democrats, it is easy enough to create the illusion of
prosperity. All you have to do is write hot checks for $200 billion
a year. ...

<HEAD>ATLANTA: a year.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For 200 years America has worked better than any society in
history. A major reason for our success is that every generation of
Americans has accepted a responsibility to expand the frontiers of
individual opportunity. We have expanded that opportunity through
universal education, the Homestead Act, land-grant colleges,
women's suffrage, Social Security, the GI bill, civil rights, and
health care. ...
   I know that if you are a teacher, or a factory worker, or if you
are just starting a family, it's almost impossible to buy a house _
no matter how hard you work or how carefully you plan.
   A college education is slipping beyond the reach of millions of
hard working Americans. If you have a child today, plan to have at
least $60,000 to send that child to a public university 18 years
from now. And if the Republicans have their way, don't count on any
college loans to help you out. ...
   Michael Dukakis has an uncanny ability to bring forth the best
in America. He knows that government can't solve all our problems.
But he also understands that government has an obligation to lead.
   And together, Mike Dukakis and I will lead a government that
cares about people, about jobs, about all regions of America, about
housing and the homeless, about the defense of freedom, about
education and health care, about justice and opportunity for all
Americans. ...
   My father is also here. He is 94 years old, proud of his
country, and proud of his son.
   He has been telling the reporters stories about me, so let me
tell one about him. My father is a symbol of what people of courage
and vision and daring can achieve in America.
   He has lived the American dream _ the dream we want to come true
for our children.
   Talk about risk-takers. His family came to this country across
the ocean, across the prairie, to homestead in South Dakota back
when the government would bet 160 acres that you couldn't make it
through the winter. ...
   My father made his way to Texas. I've made my way to Atlanta
with Michael Dukakis to stand before my family, before a united
Democratic Party, before the American people, to accept your
nomination as vice president.
   That's the American dream we have nourished and protected for
more than two centuries _ the dream of freedom and opportunity, the
chance for a step up in life.
   I want to help Michael Dukakis protect that dream for the next
generation. I want to help Michael Dukakis maintain freedom as the
most powerful and persuasive force on earth. And I want to thank
all of you for the opportunity to serve America.

<TEXT>
   Richie Havens, the folk singer whose politically
oriented songs helped define the Woodstock generation, said after a
rally Thursday near the Democratic National Convention that he's
never voted and probably never will.
   Havens performed three songs during the rally for independent
presidential candidate Lenora B. Fulani.
   In an interview after the rally was interrupted by a sudden
heavy rain, Havens said his political focus is on the millions of
people who do not vote and are unhappy with both major political
parties.
   ``For about 11 years now, I've been working with trying to
figure out why it is the majority of people don't vote,'' Havens
said. ``It isn't apathy, as the press might say, or it isn't that
they don't care about the country.
   ``They don't find anything to vote for, just like me. I'm a
non-voter myself. I never voted and I probably won't until an
individual can get a chance to vote for his country, and not for a
party.''
   Havens, remembered by many for his emotional performance at the
Woodstock festival in 1969, said he performs year-round and
recently completed his 20th tour of Europe.
   He said he continues to find an audience for his style of music,
and said more young people are discovering the music from his 1960s
heyday.
   Havens added that wherever he goes, people still ask him about
Woodstock.
   ``It's a big boom, it's a big return to a consciousness of music
going on in the world, actually,'' he said. ``Most of my friends
who were screaming about their kids listening to heavy metal a few
years ago are glad now that they're stealing their 1960s records.''

   Here are court transcript excerpts of Assistant
U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little's closing arguments to the jury
Thursday in the Wedtech racketeering trial during which he called
Attorney General Edwin Meese III ``a sleaze'':
   ``There is only one way out for Congressman (Mario) Biaggi and
his son, Richard Biaggi, and this is a defense which his lawyers
have pounded away with from the very beginning of this case. They
opened up on this. (Mario Biaggi defense attorney James) LaRossa
told you that he is going to tell you about Ed Meese. He was going
to tell you about Ronald Reagan and the White House ... All this
other detail which is fundamentally irrelevant to this case.
   ``These people aren't being tried for what Meese did or (former
Meese aide James) Jenkins did or (former White House aide Lyn)
Nofziger did or any of those other people. This is a distraction.
It would have been better, although not practical, to have everyone
that Wedtech paid off in this courtroom. Everyone from Jerry Doe
Smith in the Post Office up to Nofziger who used to work in the
White House, up to Jenkins, for what he did, and, if the proof
establishes it, up to Meese.
   ``What's the defense here? You are going to hear this one, and
it's very clear: The Wedtech officers would not have bought
Congressman Biaggi good they already bought Ed Meese. Well, this is
ridiculous ... There are two short answers to this Meese defense:
   ``First is, Meese was a sleaze. The second is, Meese was a
sleaze, too. Also. In addition to these people. Because what these
people did was to sell influence in New York City and to sell
influence in Congress ... And what Jenkins did and what (Meese
friend E. Robert) Wallach did and what they did together and we
don't know the details of it in this case because it's irrelevant,
but whatever they did with Meese was wrong, but that was done
separately in the Executive branch ...
   ``That is the big thing that the defense has been hanging their
hat on, on the Meese defense.''

   The Democrats, who have been taking swipes all
week at George Bush, paid tribute Thursday night to a Bush they
love: longtime party secretary Dorothy Bush.
   Mrs. Bush _ no relation to the vice president _ has been calling
the roll of the states at Democratic conventions in her distinctive
Southern lilt since time immemorial (actually 1944).
   The delegates watched a video tribute to her career that showed
scenes from past conventions, and magazine accounts of the striking
young woman who created a stir when she broke into the
male-dominated political world.
   Wiping tears from her eyes, the silver-haired Mrs. Bush said,
``The Democratic Party really has been good to me and it's been
good for me for many, many years.''
   ``Probably the greatest reward of all has been in the vast
number of interesting people that I have met, from precinct workers
to presidents of the United States,'' she said.
   ``You may be sure, each and every one of you Democrats, that I
promise to be a good, hard-working Democrat for the rest of my
life, absolutely!'' she said.
   The 71-year-old party stalwart said afterward she has no plans
to retire. ``I'm going full speed ahead,'' she said.
   Will she still be calling the roll come 1992?
   ``I'll just wait and see what happens.''

<TEXT>
   The Democratic National Convention was dismissed
by a Soviet news commentator Thursday as a visual spectacle with
little of the openness or freedom evident at the recent Communist
Party conference in Moscow.
   The Thursday evening news from Moscow, complete with standups in
front of The Omni, was taped and translated by Soviet television
experts at Emory University here.
   The segment, about 20 minutes into a 35-minute newscast, opened
with a yellow map of the United States and shots of The Omni,
Michael and Kitty Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy Jr. with his uncle,
Sen. Edward Kennedy.
   A voiceover described to Soviet viewers the large number of
senators, congressmen and other prominent politicians at the
gathering and said the Democrats have a good chance of returning to
power, according to a translation supplied by political science
professor Ellen Mickiewicz, creator and director of a Soviet media
center at Emory.
   Then Genrikh Borovik, described by Mickiewicz as a well-known
commentator, writer and journalist, was interviewed in front of The
Omni by a colleague, Boris Kalyagin, a European-based Soviet
reporter.
   ``It's good that the convention invited Soviet guests,'' Borovik
said, his credentials flapping on his chest. He then went on to
say, ``after our party conference, this is just boring because it's
all determined in advance. It's a show, it's a spectacle, it's
visual. For seriousness and openness and freedom, our party
conference was better.''
   At this point, Borovik switched to a friendlier assessment of
the festivities. ``Americans have their own ways, their own
customs,'' he said.
   He said the convention sent a friendly message to the Soviet
Union, one compatible with that country's ``new thinking'' _ the
code word for the reforms pressed by Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Mickewicz said the convention was featured on the Soviet news on
Monday, Wednesday and Thursday but not on Tuesday. On Thursday it
followed items about a strike at a Soviet factory, troops returning
from Afghanistan and U.S. observers arriving East Germany under
terms of the nuclear reduction treaty.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis echoed the words of his ancient
Greek forefathers in accepting the Democratic presidential
nomination Thursday, vowing to ``never bring disgrace to this, our
country, by any act of dishonesty or cowardice.''
   The pledge, which Dukakis spoke when he announced his candidacy
on April 29, 1987, and occasionally repeats in campaign speeches,
praises the virtue of public service and respect for the rule of
law.
   The Massachusetts governor often referred to the pledge when
criticizing the ethical standards of the Reagan administration.
   On Thursday, Dukakis told the Democratic National Convention,
which sealed his nomination a day earlier, that ancient Greeks
celebrated important occasions ``like this one'' by taking a pledge.
   ``That pledge _ that covenant _ is as eloquent and timely today
as it was 2000 years ago,'' he said.
   He recited:
   ``We will never bring disgrace to this, our country, by any act
of dishonesty or cowardice. We will fight for the ideals of this,
our country. We will revere and obey the laws.
   ``We will strive to quicken our sense of civic duty. Thus, in
all ways, we will transmit this country greater, better, stronger,
prouder and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.
   ``That is my pledge to you, my fellow Democrats,'' he said.
``And that is my pledge to you, the American people.''

   Alvaro Echavarria-Olarte, 50, was found guilty by a jury late
Wednesday of two conspiracy charges and six of 11 other related
charges. He is to be sentenced Aug. 3 by U.S. District Judge
Charles Legge and could get a life term.
   Echavarria was one of 16 people arrested last year when federal
and local authorities broke up what they said was a plot to carry a
ton of cocaine, worth an estimated $48 million if divided for
street sales, from Colombia to San Francisco. It was to be
distributed from there by truck throughout California, authorities
said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Stephen Graham said the plot came
to light when one of the conspirators approached a pilot, who was
an undercover Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and asked him
to fly the cocaine in a leased jet.
   Graham said Echavarria was a broker who was dealing directly
with the leaders of the Medellin cartel, considered the world's
largest cocaine ring. He was arrested in Los Angeles.

Are Made</HEAD>

   Sen. John Glenn of Ohio introduced Lloyd Bentsen
to fellow Democrats on Thursday as a winning vice presidential
candidate who _ unlike George Bush _ won't be ``out of the room,
out of pocket, out of town or out of touch'' when major White House
decisions are made.
   Glenn, himself a serious contender as Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis' running mate until Bentsen was chosen, gave no hint of
personal disappointment as he presented the Texas senator to the
Democratic National Convention.
   Speaking shortly before Bentsen's nomination for the No. 2 spot
on the Democratic ticket, Glenn drew a scathing comparison between
Bentsen _ ``a real Texan'' _ and Vice President Bush.
   ``How many real Texans do you know whose idea of Mexican food is
refried quiche?'' Glenn asked in the prepared text of his speech.
   The Ohio Democrat said Bentsen ``rejects the idea that we should
be hard on needy children and easy on greedy defense contractors,''
and believes ``you can't talk like Rambo and act like Bambi'' in
overcoming America's foreign trade deficit.
   Glenn tied Bush to a Reagan administration that he said had
``consistently taken its cues from right-wing zealots'' on women's
and civil rights issues.
   On the ethics issue, Glenn said Bush talks about being tough on
crime and wanting ``four more years,'' while more than 100 Reagan
administration officials already have been indicted or left office
under a cloud.
   ``At the rate they're going, I think some of them may end up
serving 10 or 20,'' Glenn said.
   The Ohio senator said Dukakis and Bentsen would make no deals
with terrorists or drug-pushing dictators, and that ``when major
decisions are being made, Vice President Bentsen will not be out of
the room, out of pocket, out of town or out of touch.''

   Iraq renewed its demand for direct peace
negotiations with Iran and said Thursday it has not yet decided
whether to receive a U.N. team assigned to work out details of a
truce in the 8-year-old war.
   ``The request of the secretary-general to dispatch the mission
is under discussion in Baghdad,'' Iraq's ambassador, Ismat T.
Kittani, told a news conference.
   Iran said Monday it would accept a year-old Security Council
cease-fire resolution. It has agreed to receive the eight-man U.N.
military team, due in Tehran on Sunday, but rejected Iraq's demand
that the two governments negotiate directly with each other.
   Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, the Iranian ambassador, criticized
Iraq's demand for direct talks and its other new proposals as
``extraneous elements which will only complicate the whole thing''
and delay a truce.
   He told reporters: ``Iraq wants to prolong the war, gain some
more territory and leverage and reinforce their aggressive
policies.''
   Members of the 15-nation Security Council began informal
consultations on the situation. They also were discussing problems
with the technical team and the new Iraqi demands.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar later told
reporters that he was ``reflecting very carefully'' on the letter
from Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz who urged immediate and
direct consultations with Iran in New York. The U.N. Chief also
said he was ``considering inviting both foreign ministers'' to U.N.
headquarters in New York, but had not made a decision.
   Ali-Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, sent a letter
to Perez de Cuellar on Thursday saying his government ``is fully
prepared to receive and cooperate'' with the technical mission on
details of a cease-fire.
   His letter, which diplomats made available to The Associated
Press, said Iran also is prepared to show military restraint.
   Iraq said soon after the council passed Resolution 598 on July
20, 1987, that it would accept the plan if Iran did, but the
Iranians said no truce could take effect until Iraq was branded the
aggressor in the war.
   Now Iran favors an immediate cease-fire and Iraq is hesitant.
   President Saddam Hussein's government says it suspects Iran of
playing for time to rebuild its war machine.
   Perez de Cuellar is assembling a second U.N. team to visit the
region this weekend and determine the situation of prisoners of war.
   The Security Council's Resolution 598 calls for a cease-fire to
be followed by withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders,
prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation of which
side started the war. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after
several border skirmishes.
   Kittani, the Iraqi ambassador, said after his fourth meeting in
two days with Perez de Cuellar: ``We think the first step should be
face-to-face discussions (with Iran) under the auspices of the
secretary-general.''
   In response to questions, Perez de Cuellar told reporters he was
not yet disappointed with progress in implementing a truce and did
not blame either side.
   Asked whether Iraq's insistence on direct talks might block or
delay the technical mission, Perez de Cuella said: ``No. They (the
Iraqis) only want clarifications, which I will give to them.''
   The military team of officers from the U.N. Truce Supervisory
Organization is to leave Friday or Saturday from Vienna or
Jerusalem.
   Iraq has said it was suspicious of Iran's abrupt acceptance of
the Security Council plan after rejecting it for a year.
   Kittani said Thursday that the Iranian ambassador's comments
``added to our legitimate suspiciouns, as Mr. Mahallati dismissed
our proposals as irrelevant.
   ``He wants an immediate cease-fire but there is no commitement
from himself or his government to even talk to Iraq.''
   The Iraqi envoy also emphasized the importance of dredging the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern border between the
two countries and is Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   Rival claims to the Shatt-al-Arab were a major cause of the war.
   Kittani said Thursday the issue should be discussed in direct
talks and that Iraqi access to the waterway is essential to peace
in the region. He declined to answer questions about whether
acceptance of the cease-fire team was linked to Iraq's demand for
direct negotiations.
   Middle East diplomats said privately that Iraq was annoyed by
Perez de Cuellar's handling of his announcement of the technical
team's mission. They said he consulted Mahallati but did not wait
for official Iraqi acceptance.

<TEXT>
   A plan to dump American household garbage in
Britain has been, well, dumped.
   Nick Baig, the British businessman who devised the scheme, said
Thursday that an application for permission to import refuse from
the eastern United States to northwest England has been withdrawn
because of ``impossible conditions'' set by the government.
   Critics of the idea say the American garbage could have brought
new diseases into the country and taken up dumping space needed by
Britain. So when Parliament was told Wednesday night that the deal
was off, there was general relief.
   ``It is unacceptable that the northwest should be made the
world's dust bin,'' said Winston Churchill, grandson of the wartime
leader and lawmaker for the area.
   Baig, however, accuses the British of getting too emotional
about what he believes was a beautifully simple idea to extract
gold from them thar trash cans.
   In an interview, he explained that his British company, Power,
Water and Waste, was negotiating with American municipalities for
ships to pick up garbage in New York, Boston and Philadelphia, and
take it across the Atlantic to be dumped on a 390-acre landfill
site in Merseyside, greater Liverpool.
   The Americans, he said, would pay him $50 for each ton of
garbage removed, and he would pay the British authorities $12 per
ton dumped at this end.
   Baig said he would have relieved the Americans of 1.2 million
tons a year over five years.
   But things could never be that simple.
   When Baig eyed abandoned tin mines in Cornwall, the southwest
peninsula of England, as potential garbage sites, the opposition
was so fierce that he had to shift his sights northward. The
Manchester Ship Canal Co. was interested and applied for a license
to have the imported garbage dumped at its Merseyside landfill.
   But faced with an influx of sticky beer cans, non-biodegradable
cereal boxes and half-eaten hamburgers, the government proved less
than enthusiastic.
   ``Our opinion was that it was a large volume of waste which
could have serious implications for plant and animal health,
because it could carry viruses from outside the country,'' said
Brendan Clark, an Environment Department spokesman.
   The Ministry of Agriculture told the importers they would need a
sanitation license.
   ``That is an impossibility because how can anybody inspect half
a million dust bins?'' said Baig. ``The law was designed for the
import of fresh meat and products. In our plan, none of the rubbish
would enter the food chain of beast, bird, plant or man.''
   Cheshire County Councilor Derek Bateman was quoted as telling
The Daily Telegraph newspaper the garbage would include waste from
New York hospitals, animal fat and rotting vegetation.
   ``The rubbish will not be covered, so we will have the prospect
of it blowing all over Cheshire and exposing people to a potential
health risk,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Baig called such responses ``ignorance'' and a sign of ``the
insularity of the situation here.'' He said he never expected
``emotions to be aroused.''
   But David Norbury, a Cheshire council spokesman, said Britain
has garbage problems, too. He said in an interview that his
district is relying on the dumping site to accommodate local
garbage for 25 more years, and if Baig's scheme was approved, the
site would be full in five years.

<HEAD>Drought Not Over, But Some Spots Have Heavy Rainfall, Others
Record Lows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperature records fell Thursday in the southern and central
Plains, but they were record lows, not highs; and heavy rain was
reported in parts of the South and mid-Atlantic states.
   Though it wasn't enough to erase the problems caused by a
weeks-long drought, storms that formed along a cold front extending
from the Tennessee and Ohio valleys through New England brought
locally heavy rainfall to some areas.
   Some basements were flooded in parts of Steuben County, N.Y.,
where rainfall totaled almost 2{ inches in some areas. In Catlin,
N.Y., nearly three-quarters of an inch fell in one hour.
   Heavy rainfall also occurred in parts of West Virginia,
Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
   In Maryland, storms earlier in the week prompted Gov. William
Donald Schaefer to lift a 2-week-old, statewide ban on outdoor
burning Thursday. In Rhode Island, the week's rainfall brought the
month's total to above normal.
   Early Thursday afternoon, showers and thunderstorms were
scattered from southern Texas through the Gulf Coast states, the
Appalachians, and the Atlantic Coast states; and in Wisconsin,
northeastern Illinois, and Lower Michigan.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. CDT
included 1.63 inches at Elkins, W.Va.; 1.51 inches at Chattanooga,
Tenn.; 1.50 inches at Syracuse, N.Y.; 1.14 inches at Bradford, Pa.;
1.05 inch at Elmira, N.Y.; 0.90 inch at Huntsville, Ala.; 0.79 inch
at Del Rio, Texas; 0.76 inch at Glen Falls, N.Y.; and 0.75 inch at
Muscle Shoals, Ala.
   Though areas in the Ohio, Tennessee and lower Mississippi
valleys have received substantial temporary relief the past 10
days, the drought conditions continue there and in the Missouri
Valley and Great Lakes states, with no significant relief seen in
the near future, the National Weather Service said.
   The record lows Thursday included 46 degrees In Valentine, Neb.,
4 degrees colder than the record set in 1956; 56 at Kansas City,
Mo.'s international airport, compared with 62 in 1979; 55 in
Amarillo, Texas, compared with 57 in 1897; 57 in Lubbock, Texas,
compared with 59 in 1915; and 62 in San Angelo, Texas, compared
with 64 in 1970. Denver's low of 51 tied a 7-year-old record.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 105 degrees at Luke Air Force
Base at Glendale, Ariz. Thursday's morning low was 37 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo., and West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The national forecast for Friday called for scattered showers
and thunderstorms throughout the Atlantic Coast states, Florida,
Alabama and the eastern Gulf Coast region. The storms will be most
numerous ahead of a stationary front extending from central North
Carolina across eastern Pennsylvania, southeastern New York state,
Massachusetts to southeastern Maine.
   Highs in the 70s and 80s were forecast in the middle and upper
Atlantic Coast states, the Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the Ohio
Valley, the middle and upper Mississippi Valley, the eastern half
of the central and northern Plains, and the Pacific Coast; between
100 and 105 in eastern Montana; between 100 and 115 in the desert
Southwest and parts of Nevada and Idaho; and in the 90s in most of
the rest of the nation.

   Gay rights activists whose ``kiss-in'' was
thwarted by police earlier in the week restaged it Thursday a
half-block from the Democratic National Convention site after
receiving an apology from the mayor.
   A half-dozen members of the AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power, or
ACT UP, kissed in front of the Omni Hotel, largely ignored by
passers-by. Uniformed riot police kept their backs to the
demonstrators and watched the designated convention protest zone
instead.
   Later, after a week of temperatures over 90 degrees that sent
270 protesters and bystanders to a Red Cross tent for treatment for
blisters and heat exhaustion, rain fell. Folk singer Richie Havens
was entertaining a crowd of about 1,000 in the parking lot that
serves as the protest site when the downpour started, and most
bystanders scattered.
   On Monday, when ACT UP first tried to stage the ``kiss-in,''
about 80 helmeted police officers carrying shields forced the
activists 1{ blocks to the protest site, where they were taunted
and spat on by some youths.
   A bystander later identified as a Dukakis campaign aide was hit
in the head by a rock, and a man was subsequently charged with
aggravated assault.
   ACT UP filed a complaint with the city, and on Wednesday, Mayor
Andrew Young apologized, saying the officers might have been
short-tempered because of the heat and some might have trouble
dealing with homosexuality. The city negotiated with ACT UP and
agreed to the 15-minute sidewalk demonstration.
   Frank Smithson of New York, a spokesman for ACT UP, said, ``We
were very excited about the mayor. He's an incredible man with real
concern about the lesbian and gay community.''
   As the convention wound down, so did the level of interest in
the activities in the hot blacktop parking lot where the city has
provided a stage and sound equipment to various groups.
   A morning demonstration by a mental health group drew few
spectators; one reporter read a newspaper in a patch of shade.
Later, bystanders appeared far more interested in the shift-change
by riot-uniformed policemen, and some officers posed for pictures
along Marietta Street.
   By far the most arrests of the week came Tuesday morning, when
135 anti-abortion activists tried to blockade a clinic where
abortions are performed. All were granted bond, but some 120
remained jailed Thursday for refusing to give their names.
   Also in the protest zone Thursday, a coalition of groups from
the home state of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
complained about his environmental record, saying he has been
insensitive to such issues as governor of Massachusetts.
   ``If he's going to be a really great leader, then we need to
educate him and educate him now,'' said Noreen Brodeur-Routhier.

   Campaign literature issued by Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen during his previous Senate races exaggerated the number of
missions he flew in World War II, but the error was corrected a few
years ago, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Bentsen is campaigning for a fourth term in the Senate at the
same time he is running for vice president on the Democratic ticket
with Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   All versions of Bentsen's biography agree that as a B-24 bomber
pilot based in Italy he was decorated for distinguished service and
discharged at the end of the war as a colonel in the reserves.
   Air Force records, consistent with Bentsen's biographies, show
that he received the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters and the
Distinguished Flying Cross and Europe-Africa-Mideast Theater Ribbon
for serving in Italy.
   But official biographies put out during earlier campaigns by the
senator say that ``Bentsen flew 50 bomber missions over Europe
during the war.''
   Air Force records show that he flew 35 combat missions, and
logged 129 combat hours, according to an Air Force spokesman, Maj.
Lou Figeroa.
   Bentsen spokesman Chris Peacock, contacted at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, said that ``the biography issued by
the senator's office now lists no number of combat missions.''
   ``The reason for that is that several years ago, there were
biographies that had a number. We discovered that the number was in
error, so the number was dropped.''
   Jack Devore, Bentsen's press secretary, said he is not sure how
the incorrect number worked its way into the official biographies.
   ``A few years ago I sent his bio routinely in for Senator
Bentsen and Senator Bentsen said, `Jack, I don't think that's
right,''' Devore said. He said Bentsen could not remember whether
he had flown 34 or 35 missions, so the number was omitted
altogether in subsequent literature.
   According to the Air Force, Bentsen enlisted in the Army Air
Corps, the precursor to the Air Force, on April 11, 1942, and
became a commissioned officer on Oct. 28 of that year.
   He served as an assistant intelligence officer until June 1943,
then was a student pilot from June 1943 to January 1944.
   From March 1945, Bentsen was stationed in Italy as a B-24 pilot,
rising to squadron commander, Air Force records show.
   According to biographies put out by Bentsen, he was promoted
from major to a colonel in the reserves at the time of his
discharge, on July 20, 1945.
   A brochure bearing Bentsen's logo and dated Jan. 2, 1970 _ the
year he was first elected toOOe Senate _ said: ``He flew 50
missions over Europe.''
   Another biography from the 1970 campaign said: ``In World War
II, he entered the Army Air Corps as a private, became a pilot, and
flew more than 50 combat missions, earning the distinguished flying
cross and three air medals _ ending his career in the service as a
colonel.''
   An eight-page advertising supplement in the Fort Worth Star
Telegram from Sunday, April 5, 1970, said: ``During World War II,
he flew more than 50 combat missions as a bomber pilot, part of
them as a squadron commander.''
   A biography bearing the logo, ``Bentsen '76 Senate Campaign,''
said: ``He served in the Army Air Corps as commander of a B-24
squadron, flew 50 missions over Europe, and rose to the rank of
major.''
   A biography on the ``1984 Democratic National Convention Fact
Sheet,'' said that ``Bentsen flew 50 bomber missions over Europe
during the war.''
   Bentsen's current biography says that ``he rose to major and
B-24 squadron commander during World War II'' and ``was a colonel
in the Air Force reserves'' when he left active duty.
   ``During one bombing mission over Europe he made a forced
landing on the Island of Viz in the Adriatic,'' the current
biography says.
   ``Years later, in 1972, as a senator visiting Yugoslavia, he had
a chance to personally thank Marshal (Jozef Broz) Tito, whose
partisans kept the Viz airstrip open and made it possible for
Allied forces to send in a plane and bring Bentsen and crew to
safety,'' the official biography says.

   Wisconsin's corn crop looks a little
greener than that of other drought-stricken states, but that does
not diminish the help needed by Wisconsin farmers, Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng said Thursday.
   Lyng, wearing a ``Think Rain'' button, inspected the 285-acre
farm of Ken and Mary Ellen Falch as part of a 10-state tour through
the parched corn belt.
   ``We've seen corn that's terribly disappointing,'' Lyng told a
crowd of about 250 gathered at the farm. ``I don't think there's
anyplace where we haven't seen corn that's totally unusable.''
   In Breckenridge, Mich., a rumbling sky announced the approach of
rain later on Thursday while Lyng viewed the drought's effects. It
was the last leg of the agriculture secretary's tour.
   ``Seeing it firsthand has a lot more impact than hearing
reports. It's the same all over _ it's hard,'' Lyng told several
dozen farmers. ``I am impressed with the challenge agriculture is
facing and the way farmers are responding. I, for one, will try to
help.''
   U.S. Rep. Bill Schuette, Michigan's only representative on the
House Agriculture Committee working on a drought relief bill, said
he expects the bill to go to a floor vote July 28.
   While Lyng was in Chippewa Falls, Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson
was at the farm to sign a bill to provide farmers with a 10 percent
property tax credit, up to a maximum of $1,000, on this year's
bills.
   ``Right now, we're going through the psychology of the
drought,'' Thompson said, standing beside Lyng. ``In a few months,
we'll be going through the economy of the drought.''
   Falch told Lyng that his yield would be cut from 165 bushels per
acre last year to about 50 bushels per acre this year.
   Lyng told the crowd that the trip to Wisconsin and other drought
states has given him ``a better appreciation of the need for
forage.'' Lyng said he hoped federal farm legislation to address
the problem would emphasize direct payments to farmers to buy feed
and to help them pay for other day-to-day needs.
   Lyng said he will report to President Reagan on Monday.

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley to the Democratic National Convention
Thursday night.
   Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
   Mr. Chairman and delegates to the Democratic National
Convention, this is a real first for me tonight. This is the first
time I have spoken to a national convention and this is the first
time I will have performed in The Omni wearing long pants.
   I've been asked to speak about the role of the presidency in
American life. Let me begin by asking a few questions.
   Does it make a difference who's president of the United States?
Did Lincoln make a difference? Did Woodrow Wilson? Ask any child
who stares in wonder at the Grand Canyon if Teddy Roosevelt made a
difference. Ask anyone who lived through the Depression, out of
work and out of luck, if Franklin Roosevelt made a difference. Ask
any European who loves democracy if Harry Truman made a difference.
Ask anyone who cares about human rights if Jimmy Carter made a
difference.
   Do presidents make a difference? Teapot Dome, Iran-Contra,
Watergate, the Depression. Do presidents make a difference? You bet
they do. And Democratic presidents have made the most positive
difference.
   The strength of a president comes from his character. A good
president knows that public office is one of democracy's marvelous
abstractions _ that you exercise power but you must never claim it.
   When you go into the voting booth and pull that lever down for
president, you make the most important decision a voter makes.
Before making that decision, I'd ask myself a few questions: whom
do I trust with my life, whom do I trust with my job, and who
shares my hopes for my town, my family and my country.
   A president must engender trust because a president leads by
trust. Trust is a bond earned by honest words and honest actions.
   A good president doesn't define honesty as simply staying out of
jail.
   The words of a president can show how the past is a part of the
present, and how both can lead to a better future. He can give
reassurance and understanding to those who have never been
reassured or understood; he can give guidance in a world that
technology changes every day. The words of a president, like
nature's returning seasons, can provide continuity in the midst of
change.

   Here are excerpts from the prepared text of the
speech by Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to the Democratic
National Convention on Thursday night as he accepted the party's
presidential nomination.
   We're going to win because we are the party that believes in the
American dream. ...
   A dream that brought my father to this country 76 years ago;
that brought my mother and her family here one year later _ poor,
unable to speak English, but with a burning desire to succeed in
their new land of opportunity.
   And tonight, in the presence of that marvelous woman who is my
mother and who came here 75 years ago; with the memory in my heart
of the young man, who arrived at Ellis Island with only $25 in his
pocket, but with a deep and abiding faith in the promise of
America; tonight, as a son of immigrants with a wonderful wife and
four terrific children; as a proud public servant who has cherished
every minute of the last 16 months on the campaign trail, I accept
your nomination for the presidency of the United States. ...
   It's time to rekindle the American spirit of invention and
daring; to exchange voodoo economics for can-do economics; to build
the best America by bringing out the best in every American.
   It's time to wake up to the new challenges that face the
American family.
   Time to see that young families in this country are never again
forced to choose between the jobs they need and the children they
love; time to be sure that parents are never again told no matter
how long they work or how hard their child tries, a college
education is a right they can't afford.
   It's time to ask why it is that we have run up more debt in this
country in the last eight years than we did in the previous 200;
and to make sure it never happens again.
   It's time to understand that the greatest threat to our national
security in this hemisphere is not the Sandinistas _ it's the
avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this country and poisoning
our children. ...
   Because this election isn't about ideology. It's about
competence. ...
   We're going to take America's genius out of cold storage and
challenge our youngsters; we're going to make our schools and
universities and laboratories the finest in the world; and we're
going to make teaching a valued and honored profession once again.
   We're going to light fires of innovation and enterprise from
coast to coast ...
   Now, I have a reputation for being a frugal man. In nine years,
I've balanced nine more budgets than this administration has and
I've just balanced a tenth. And I've worked with the citizens of my
state _ worked hard to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs _
and I mean good jobs, jobs you can raise a family on, jobs you can
build a future on, jobs you can count on. ...
   And what we have done reflects a simple but very profound idea _
an idea as powerful as any in human history.
   It is the idea of community.
   It is the idea that we are in this together ... It is an idea
that was planted in the new world by the first governor of
Massachusetts.
   ``We must,'' said John Winthrop, ``love one another with a pure
heart fervently. We must delight in each other, make each other's
condition our own, rejoice together, mourn together, and suffer
together ... We must be knit together as one.'' ...
   When a young mother named Dawn Lawson leaves seven years of
welfare to become a personnel specialist in a Fortune 500 company
in Worcester, Mass. _ we are all enriched and ennobled.
   When a Catholic priest named Bill Kraus helps homeless families
in Denver not just by giving them shelter, but by helping them to
find the jobs they need to get back on their feet, we are all
enriched and ennobled.

   When a high school principal named George McKenna and his
dedicated staff of teachers and counselors create a real
environment for learning at the George Washington Preparatory High
School in Los Angeles, a high school that is 90 percent black and
10 percent Hispanic and has 80 percent of its graduates admitted to
college, we are all enriched and ennobled.
   When a dedicated new management team and a fine union in
Milwaukee work together to turn Harley-Davidson around and help it
come back to life, we are all enriched and ennobled.
   And when a man named Willie Velasquez can register tens of
thousands of his fellow citizens as voters, and bring new energy
and new ideas and new people into court houses and city halls and
state capitals all across the southwest _ we are all enriched and
ennobled.
   (Y cuando un Willie Velasquez puede inscribir decena de miles de
sus conciudadanos para votar, brindando asi nuevas energias, nuevas
ideas, nuevas personas a los gobiernos municipales y estatales del
suroeste todos nos enriquecemos y enoblecemos.) ...
   We must be _ we are _ and we will be _ militarily strong.
   But we must back that military strength with economic strength;
we must give the men and women of our armed forces weapons that
work; we must have a secretary of defense who will manage _ and not
be managed by _ the Pentagon; and we must have a foreign policy
that reflects the decency and the principles and the values of the
American people.
   President Reagan has set the stage for deep cuts in nuclear arms
_ and I salute him for that.
   He has said that we should judge the Soviet Union not by what it
says, but by what it does _ and I agree with that.
   But we can do a lot more to stop the spread of nuclear and
chemical arms; we can do a lot more to bring peace to Central
America and to the Middle East; and we can and we will do a lot
more to end apartheid in South Africa. ...
   We're going to have a Justice Department that isn't the
laughingstock of the nation ...
   We're going to have nominees to the federal bench who are men
and women of integrity and intelligence and who understand the
Constitution of the United States.
   We're going to have an Environmental Protection Agency that's
more interested in stopping pollution than in protecting the
polluters.
   We're going to have a real war _ not a phony war _ against
drugs; and we won't be doing business with drug-running Panamanian
dictators.
   We're going to have a vice president who won't sit silently by
when somebody at the National Security Council comes up with the
cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages; we're going to have a vice president named Lloyd Bentsen
who will walk into the Oval Office and say, ``Mr. President, this
is nuts.'' ...
   And as I accept your nomination tonight, I can't help recalling
that the first marathon was run in ancient Greece, and that on
important occasions like this one, the citizens of Athens would
complete their ceremonies by taking a pledge.
   That pledge _ that covenant _ is as eloquent and timely today as
it was 2,000 years ago.
   ``We will never bring disgrace to this, our country, by any act
of dishonesty or cowardice. We will fight for the ideals of this,
our country. We will revere and obey the laws. We will strive to
quicken our sense of civic duty. Thus, in all these ways, we will
transmit this country greater, better, stronger, prouder and more
beautiful than it was transmitted to us.''
   That is my pledge to you, my fellow Democrats.
   And that is my pledge to you, the American people.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: of change.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Harry Truman would say that the words of the next president must
be plain talk to the American people _ about what needs to be done
_ and why.
   We've made government very complex when it's really very simple.
   Do we want young couples to be able to own a home?
   Do we want our children to live in safe neighborhoods with good
schools?
   Do we believe child care for working parents is a necessity?
   Do we want our grandparents to get decent health care?
   Do we want to clean up the environment?
   These are very simple questions _ made difficult by people who
don't care about the answers. Do we care? Do we care enough to
elect a president who cares?
   A president who cares will never shy away from confronting those
who sit in judgement of the poor from the vantage point of the
veranda.
   The founding fathers didn't write a constitution and create a
government only for the 1790's. They created a political system,
enduringly alive, and flexible enough to allow each generation of
Americans to remake its world.
   Our motto, as Rev. Jackson recalled the other night, ``Out of
Many, One,'' recognizes both our individualism and our common
purpose. But achieving unity is no easy task.
   Part of us always strives for difference: for individual
liberty, individual progress, individual achievement. We've put our
faith in free men and women and open markets. We've achieved
material progress on a scale never before known on earth. And we
have never feared to speak our mind.
   Surely, no serious person would risk that individual freedom.
   But individualism without some limits imposes heavy costs.
Personal initiative can become destructive greed. The company that
employed thousands can leave town without notice. The business that
gave life to a community may have poisoned it with toxic wastes.
   And beyond individualism, our life depend on virtues _ simple
virtues: courage, honor, truth. These are the essential virtues of
a republic. The essential elements of political character. And none
of them can be bought. Rather, they're gifts we give to each other;
and we can repay each other only in kind.
   FDR said, ``The presidency is preeminently a role of moral
leadership.''
   A good president knows that our lives are not separate from
other lives around us. He knows too that the ultimate challenge
posed to a citizen in a democracy is to ask yourself what you owe
another human being. And by that I don't mean what you owe
yourself, or your family or your friends, but what you owe a
stranger simply because he or she is a human being. Do you owe more
than a contribution to charity or taxes to the government? Do you
owe a commitment of some part of your life? Or, do you believe you
owe them nothing at all? How we answer these questions will
determine the kind of society we become.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: we become.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In this century, it's been Democrats who've committed our
political capital to the belief that long-term prosperity derives
from a caring national community. We not only believe it _ we lived
it; we made it work. It's been Democrats who've understood that our
future is stagnant unless our economy expands to include all those
who've been left out. Yet, we also believe that the promise of
America is not comfort but freedom, not a numbing
self-preoccupation but an opportunity for everyone to compete on
reasonably equal footing.
   As John Kennedy said, ``Courage, not complacency, is what we
need today'' _ the new frontier arrived and departed long ago, but
the need for courage remains. We live in a time when thousands die
each year from a disease that was unknown a decade ago; when the
Soviet Union's arsenals remain full even as Gorbachev moves toward
reform; when environmental plunder threatens the building blocks of
nature; when drugs and violence create no-parent families and
homeless ten-year-olds.
   The next president must be a person who is awake and will stay
awake _ because he can't rest while kids kill kids in our cities
and families sleep on the streets.
   The next president must be a person with enough wisdom to know
that despite the bitterness and bloodshed in the modern world,
mankind has never been able to do more for itself than it can today.
   The next president must not merely preside, but must work and
lead.
   The most mysterious bond in American politics is the bond
between the people and the president. It goes beyond words to
symbols, memories and a sense of place.
   Remember Franklin Roosevelt, in his wheelchair _ his words over
the radio, clear and simple, aimed first at Depression and then
war, but always at fear.
   Remember John Kennedy _ his Peace Corps that urged young people
to go to every corner of the world, and young people who went
because they sensed in him a commitment to truth and the absence of
cant that honored their own intelligence and judgement.
   Remember Lyndon Johnson, a Southerner, a Texan who affirmed in
law our conviction, both black and white, that we shall overcome.
   Remember the feeling the first time you visited the Jefferson
and Lincoln memorials? I do.
   Remember last night _ seeing Jesse Jackson, his name placed in
nomination for president of the United States. Rev. Jackson, thank
you for helping us understand.
   The president is, in Emerson's phrase, our ``representative
man.'' He embodies America and gives our lives meaning. He doesn't
express some higher truth from above or lead a legislative
majority. He's simply himself...but, with the right person at the
right time, by being himself, he becomes a part of us all.
   Maybe that's why most of us remember where we were, and what we
were doing, and how we felt the day we heard that FDR died or the
day John Kennedy was shot.
   Tonight, after two years of party contest and on the eve of a
tough general election, we give our candidate to the country --
Michael Dukakis, the son of immigrants, who personifies the promise
of America and the traditions of New England; a person committed to
excellence, who is calm under pressure, and has the capacity to
know what's important. A Democrat excited to take the reins of
government _ and make it work once again. A leader committed to
govern all of the people and proud of this land.
   Thank you.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Rep. Daniel
Rostenkowski of Illinois nominating Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for
vice president at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday
night.
   I come before you tonight to nominate my friend and legislative
partner, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen to our party's nominee for vice
president of the United States.
   Lloyd Bentsen has everything it takes to become one of America's
great vice presidents and Michael Dukakis has chosen the best
teammate that America has to offer.
   I've spent a lot of time with Lloyd Bentsen. I've seen one
victory after another. Earlier this year, we enacted the greatest
expansion of Medicare ever.
   Later this year, we'll finish a welfare reform bill. The new
trade bill will soon become law and we're fighting to keep the tax
system fair.
   You don't negotiate through many nights under enormous pressure
without taking the true measure of a man. Lloyd Bentsen is
straightforward. Lloyd Bentsen is smart. And, yes, Lloyd Bentsen is
tough.
   He knows that compromise keeps the political process running.
The victories haven't come easily but through Lloyd Bentsen's
leadership, important victories have been won and the nation is
better for it.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a member of the United States Senate. And I am
a member of the House of Representatives. He's from Texas and I'm
from Illinois.
   We each have our own style. But when you strip away our regional
loyalties, we both have the same goals for America.
   I represent thousands of people on the northwest side of the
city of Chicago. My constituents are people who run our stores,
work in our factories, teach our children, drive our buses, and
protect our neighborhoods.
   But they're Lloyd Bentsen's constituents, too.
   They may not be famous, one by one, but together they're the
backbone of America and the soul of the Democratic Party.
   They work hard, they're honest, they pay their mortgages and
taxes on time, they live from paycheck to paycheck, trying to put a
little bit aside each month.
   Lloyd Bentsen knows these people and has fought for these people.
   That's why I want to make a special appeal to them tonight.
   Come home. Come home to your party. Come home to the party that
has contributed so much to our social progress.
   The Democratic Party is the party of your parents. Come home to
the Democratic Party. Come on home where you belong.
   We still believe that those who can work should have a good job
that pays a decent wage, that government should not turn its back
on those who can't make it on their own, that we can find our ways
to educate our kids, to fight drugs and crime, to care
compassionately for our elderly and to accomplish all this without
breaking the bank.
   Lloyd Bentsen believes that no one should get a free ride, but
no one should be left behind, either.
   Isn't that what we all believe?
   Lloyd Bentsen is one of a few men in public life who is at home
with those who are trying to make it in America, and those who
already have. He speaks the language of businessmen because he used
to be one.
   And he knows what business owes working Americans.
   That's why Lloyd Bentsen resisted Republican efforts to gut
social programs that we all depend on, like protecting children and
older Americans, like improving the lives of America's workers. He
fights for those who seek a better life because he knows they
deserve it.
   That's what our Democratic Party is all about.
   And that's what Lloyd Bentsen stands for.
   And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what this election is all
about.
   My fellow delegates in this hall, my fellow Democrats across
this great country, to all America, it is a high honor and a great
privilege, to place in nomination as our candidate to be the next
vice president of the United States, the senior senator from the
great state of Texas, Lloyd Bentsen.

<HEAD>Delegates Finally Get a Towering _ A Really Towering _ Democrat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For once, a really towering Democrat _ not the
towering kind evoked in political rhetoric _ addressed the
Democratic National Convention.
   Bill Bradley, the senator from New Jersey who once played on two
world champion New York Knicks basketball teams, got the kind of
reception from convention delegates that marks him as a political
comer.
   The hall blossomed with orange and blue signs, not for Michael
Dukakis or Jesse Jackson, but for ``Bill Bradley, New Jersey's
pride.''
   At 6-foot-5, Bradley was too tall to use the prompting devices
on either side of the podium, so his speech was scrolled up on a
television screen across the hall.
   ``This is a real first for me tonight,'' he said. ``It's the
first time I've spoken to a national convention and the first time
I've performed in The Omni wearing long pants.''
   The convention hall normally is used for Atlanta Hawks games.
   Bradley made everybody's list of vice presidential possibilities
early in the Democratic campaign, but he took himself out of
consideration last month.
   ``Does it make any difference who is president of the United
States?'' he asked.
   ``Did Lincoln make a difference? Did Woodrow Wilson ... Ask
anyone who lived through the depression if Franklin Delano
Roosevelt made a difference. Ask any European who has democracy if
Harry Truman made any difference. Ask anyone who cares about human
rights if Jimmy Carter made a difference.''
   By the time Bradley took the microphone, before Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen's name was put in nomination for the vice presidency, the
convention hall was filled to overflowing.
   The delegates let loose with some of the most enthusiastic
cheering of the night when former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, a
heroine of Democrats since the Watergate days of Richard Nixon,
seconded Bentsen's nomination.
   ``Why?'' she asked. ``First of all because he's my senator and I
wasn't planning to come to this convention for any purpose'' other
than that.
   ``Our minds are turning away from `Hooray for Hollywood' and we
are now confronted with the hard reality of a natioln which desires
to become solvent again,''
   ``We want to retake the moral high ground,'' she said.
   ``The rostrum was lowered to desk height to accommodate Ms.
Jordan's wheelchair. She suffers from a degenerative bone disease.
   True to his word, the fire marshal closed the doors at 7:30
p.m., shutting out hundreds for the third night. The smart people
got in early.
   Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida, the oldest House member at age
87, sat on the front row of his state's delegation for his 13th
Democratic convention _ every one since 1940 when Roosevelt was
nominated for his third term.
   ``It's a well-run convention, well-handled,'' he said. ``It
shows Dukakis' good management skills. We're going to be
victorious.''
   But you couldn't sell that to many Democrats who had to miss
dinner to make it inside the hall. Long lines formed at The Omni's
food concessions, where the menu consisted of pizza, hot dogs,
popcorn and ice cream bars.
   Inevitably, some concessions ran out of food.
   That did nothing to dampen the spirit of John Economos, a
restaurateur from Des Moines, Iowa. He carried a hand-lettered sign
that read, ``Vote for Dukakis and Bentsen.'' Nothing unusual about
that, except it was in Greek.
   All was hope and promise in the convention hall on the last
night.
   ``Do you feel the excitement in the air?'' asked the chairman,
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   ``Yes!'' shouted the delegates.
   ``Are we going carry the South this year?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Will we win in November?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Do you promise me that?''
   ``Yes!''

   The overcrowded arena holding the Democratic
National Convention was sealed Thursday night for the third night
in a row as the party turned out for the convention's final night
acceptance speech by presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   The Omni was sealed for safety reasons by order of the fire
marshal at 7:35 p.m. EDT, about a half-hour before the evening
session began. Democratic National Committee officials said they
agreed with the decision.
   About 200 people _ many of them delegates _ crowded around two
entrances to the arena, some of them cursing and shouting, ``I'm a
delegate,'' and demanding admission to the hall.
   Among those locked out were Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio,
Theodore Sorensen, a guest of the New York delegation and a White
House aide to former President Kennedy, and Willard Scott, the
ubiquitous weatherman from NBC's ``Today'' show.
   In addition to Dukakis' speech, the party Thursday night was
selecting Lloyd Bentsen as the vice presidential nominee and
hearing an acceptance speech from him.
   Party officials earlier had braced for another round of
complaints from delegates locked out of The Omni and said a system
had been set up to get super delegates and ``essential personnel''
into the hall even after it is closed. But the new system would not
accommodate regular delegates, they said.
   Outside the hall, Mayor Johnny Ford of Tuskegee, Ala., a Jackson
delegate, said he was disappointed but not angry: ``There was a
time when we would be raising Cain, but as you can see, we're very
calm. There's more important things to worry about, like winning in
November.''
   The crowd was sedate until Polly Miller, a Gore delegate from
Asheville, N.C., suddenly started shouting at the top of her lungs
into a television camera under a klieg light. ``We were elected in
our states! Who's in our seats?'' she demanded. ``We paid to get
here! Who's voting in there?''
   ``We want in!'' the delegates started chanting, many of them
bitterly denouncing the Democrats' choice of Atlanta for the
convention site. But the outrage died quickly when they spotted
Willard Scott, and many scrambled to get his autograph.
   ``I can see locking me out, but how can they lock out the
delegates?'' Scott said. ``I can't believe it.''
   There was little sympathy from convention organizers, who said
delegates should know better than to show up late for the nightly
sessions.
   ``Everybody knew we were going to have this problem,'' said
party finance director Donald R. Sweitzer. ``If you don't have
foresight enough to get in to meet your obligations as a delegate,
I don't have a lot of sympathy.''
   The arena had been sealed in mid-session on Tuesday and
Wednesday nights when Atlanta's fire marshal determined that
crowding inside had reached its maximum safe level.
   But dozens of delegates, including members of the House and
Senate, were steamed when they were locked out and missed votes or
what they saw as historic speeches.
   ``This is an injustice ... it's outrageous,'' said Michael
Stein, a delegate from Chicago who was left out in the heat
Wednesday night.
   Among members of Congress fenced out were Sens. Edward Kennedy
of Massachusetts, Alan Cranston of California, Bob Graham of
Florida and J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana. Texas Treasurer Ann
Richards, who delivered the convention keynote speech, also was
barred from entering Wednesday night.
   ``Thank God, we've got another chance to go somewhere else in
four years where there will be some room,'' retiring Rep. Ed Jones
told his Tennessee delegation Thursday.
   By contrast, Republican officials said they expect to have so
many extra seats available for their convention in New Orleans next
month that they may offer tickets to the public. The spacious
Louisiana Superdome will have room for an estimated 40,000
conventioneers.
   Nadine Wong, a convention management spokeswoman, said Thursday
she expects about 30,000 people _ delegates, reporters and guests _
to attend each day of the four-day event. She said officials are
looking for a way to parcel out the empty seats and still maintain
security.
   Adding to the confusion and overcrowding at the Democratic
convention were an estimated 1,700 people who received passes to
get into The Omni arena because of their status as big-ticket
contributors to the party.
   Members of the party's National Finance Council, whose members
give at least $5,000 each, its Business Council, who give $10,000
or more apiece, and its Victory Fund, who commit to give or raise
$100,000, all receive passes to the convention hall, Sweitzer said.
   He estimated that during convention sessions, about 1,000 of
those with contributor passes were actually in the hall, which
seats 12,500 to 13,000 people in its configuration for the
quadrennial event. Thousands of seats were sacrificed to build a
huge podium full of technical gear and press seating, and skyboxes
for television crews.
   But Sweitzer said contributors do not compete for the 4,212
delegate seats. Their passes do not permit them on the convention
floor, but give access only to guest seating high in the arena, he
said. They share that space with 1,170 alternates and other guests,
he said.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Thomas
Daschle of South Dakota seconding the nomination of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas for vice president at the Democratic National
Convention on Thursday night.
   My name is Tom Daschle and I'm here to tell you that the last
thing we need on the prairie is another dried up old Bush.
   We need a change. We need Michael Dukakis.
   And we need Lloyd Bentsen.
   South Dakotans pay no greater respect to anyone than to those
pioneers who found partnership with the land. Our glory comes from
those who carved dreams from that land, under a sky so vast that
only greatness could unfold.
   The Bentsen family is a story of the American dream, of taking
chances, of beating the odds; a story of a family's life in South
Dakota and the rigors of survival in the American West, a rugged
beginning from which our roots take hold, roots of American life
that sprout qualities from which our nation draws its greatness,
roots of American soul that lend strength to our nation's values.
   Roots from which descendants of Greek and Danish immigrants will
soon become the president and vice president of the greatest
country in the world.
   And it is from these roots that values are born.
   Roots are not force-fed; they are passed on.
   Values are not worn on the sleeve but come from the soul and
emanate through the words and deeds of those who live them.
   Lloyd Bentsen's values _ born in the West, nurtured in the South
_ are now evident across this land.
   Like those of Michael Dukakis, they are values of genuine
American leadership:
   _ A deep respect of human dignity.
   _ A rare courage to stand up for one's beliefs.
   _ And a profound belief that he owes the nation much more than
this nation owes him.
   As this man lives out these beliefs, this nation has been paid
back in multitude, and we are the beneficiaries.
   So, now as he faces the American people, let us confirm what we
know: that Bentsen leadership is American leadership of the most
valuable kind, leadership marked not by what one says, but by what
one does.
   And for those of us who call rural America home, we also call
Lloyd Bentsen ``friend;'' someone who fights with us, not against
us for the family farm; and someone who believes, as we believe,
that Reagan and Bush are to agriculture what the drought is to
wheat and corn; someone who fights with us, not against us because
Americans can win in any marketplace if the competition is fair;
and who believes, as we believe, that someone deathly sick in the
countryside ought to have the same chance opportunity as someone in
country club square.
   To rural Americans tonight who listen from their family farms;
who may be watching from the town cafe; who may occupy a bed in a
rural hospital, or a desk in a small classroom, or a counter in the
town hardware store; let me say to each one of you and to all
Americans: This man stands with us, on accomplishments not
promises, on values not vagaries, with roots that are our roots. He
is the son of our heritage. He is our friend.
   So it is with humility and great pride tonight that I second the
nomination of the next vice president of the United States, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen.

   On the last night of the Democratic National
Convention:
   Before The Omni arena filled and went into gridlock, medical
technicians hustled across the convention floor with a stretcher
loaded with enough life-saving equipment to outfit a small clinic.
   A call had come in to a Red Cross station off the convention
floor that someone in the Virginia delegation was hurt.
   But when the medics got to the Virginia delegation, they found
no one to help. ``I think somebody made a prank call,'' said Bryan
Davis, a convention security man.

   Sen. Bob Graham of Florida was among the party bigwigs locked
out of the hall by the fire marshals Wednesday night. He had gone
out for dinner and found the doors blocked after dessert.
   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards wound up watching the nominating
roll call on television but Graham eventually made it in. He
learned his lesson _ or did he?
   When the convention opened for its final session at 5 p.m.
Graham was on the floor. But he said he would leave the hall for
dinner with his family before returning to hear Michael Dukakis'
acceptance speech.

   In the recess between afternoon and evening session, the Indiana
and Minnesota delegations stood on their chairs facing each other.
Did they shout ``Duke, Duke'' and ``Jesse, Jesse?''
   No. They aped a popular beer commercial. Indiana chanted:
``Tastes Great!'' Minnesota's response: ``Less Filling.''

   Jackson delegate Constance Howard of Chicago was still sporting
her big ``Jackson '88'' button.
   ``I feel fine. Disappointed, of course,'' said Howard, a
Democratic state committee woman. Did she expect Jackson's
followers to be enthusiastic about Dukakis' speech?
   ``We're going to have to do an awful lot of work to convince
them Rev. Jackson wasn't slighted on this deal,'' she said. ``It's
a challenge.'' She said one speech wouldn't allay all the doubts.

<HEAD>Shultz Confident Military Bases Will Remain in Philippines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George Shultz said Thursday
he was confident after talks with Philippines President Corazon
Aquino that American military bases will remain in that country.
   ``The bases are very important to the Philippines and to the
United States,'' Shultz said after a speech here on his way home
from a 2{-week trip through Asia and the Pacific.
   The United States and the Philippines are reviewing the treaty
for U.S. naval and air bases in the Philippines, which expires in
1991. The Aquino government has asked the United States to pay more
than $180 million a year to renew the treaty.
   ``I believe it will come to a successful outcome, but we're
still in the process so I can't say for sure,'' Shultz said of the
negotiations.
   ``We're getting somewhere,'' he said. ``I'm still bullish on the
Philippines.''
   Mrs. Aquino said last week she expects American and Filipino
negotiators to complete their talks by the end of this month. The
41-year-old lease applies to Clark Air Base, Subic Naval Base and
four smaller U.S. outposts.
   Both sides refused to reveal details of the negotiations.
   Shultz said the Philippines economy has improved in the two
years since Mrs. Aquino took office, and that the U.S. bases and
economic aid helped spur the growth. The country's growth rate
after adjustment for inflation is about 7 percent this year, up
from 5.5 percent last year, he said.
   Shultz made his comments after a speech at the East-West Center
here, a research institute created by Congress and devoted to
issues facing Asia and the Pacific. It was his first public
appearance since returning to the United States early Wednesday
from a trip to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Hong
Kong, China, South Korea, Japan and the Marshall Islands.
   He is to return to Washington Friday.
   While Shultz hailed improved relations between the United States
and the Soviet Union, saying they could have a ``ripple effect'' on
other adversarial nations, he said Moscow was sending confusing
signals in Asia and the Pacific.
   ``We have to wait and see,'' he said. ``I don't see why right
now is the time for the Soviet Union to supply North Korea with new
surface-to-air missiles. ... What's the message?''
   Both the United States and the Soviet Union have pledged to help
minimize conflicts between North and South Korea during the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea in September.
   About 75 people waving banners that said ``Stop U.S.
Intervention in Central America'' protested Shultz's appearance,
yelling ``U.S.-C.I.A. out of Central America,'' as police escorted
his entourage after the talk.
   Shultz did not mention Central America in his speech or his
answers to screened questions from the invited audience of 630
people.

<TEXT>
   An Ariane-3 rocket carrying
satellites for European and Indian customers blasted off without a
hitch Thursday from the European Space Agency's launch site in the
jungles of French Guiana.
   Shortly after the 7:12 p.m. EDT liftoff, the satellites were put
into orbit.
   The liftoff from the launch pad in Kourou, on the northeast
coast of South America, was the 24th for Arianespace, the company
responsible for commercial flights of European rockets.
   ``We are particularly happy tonight to have successfully
launched the Indian satellite,'' said Frederic d'Allest, director
of Arianespace.
   He noted that ``Arianespace has put 11 satellites into orbit in
11 months'' and said the company had additional launches scheduled
for September, October, November and December. Nine launches are
set for 1989.
   ``But we need to remain vigilant and not be lulled into a
routine,'' he said.
   Cloudy weather at the launch site caused a six-minute delay in
the countdown.
   At 7:07 p.m. EDT the countdown was resumed and five minutes
later the rocket lifted off into the night sky. Its brilliant
orange flame was obscured by the low clouds moments after takeoff.
   Seventeen minutes after takeoff the rocket attained the orbiting
altitude of 22,500 miles.
   Within four minutes, the two satellites were launched into a
geostationary orbit _ ECS-5 for Eutelsat, the European Organization
of Satellite Communications, and INSAT-1C for the Indian government.
   Ariane-3 is capable of lifting 2.8 tons into space, compared to
the new generation Ariane-4 rocket which can carry a maximum load
of 4.6 tons. The new, powerful rocket was launched for the first
time June 15, carrying three satellites into orbit. It is scheduled
to blast off again in November.
   The versatile Ariane-4, developed at a cost of $575 million,
will be used with increasing frequency to meet Arianespace's
backlog of 42 launch orders.
   ECS-5, weighing 2,607 pounds, was constructed jointly by the
French aerospace and defense giant Matra and British Aerospace. The
satellite will upgrade long distance telephone service from
Portugal to Finland and Turkey to Ireland during its seven-year
lifespan.
   Eutelsat, which groups 26 national telecommunications
authorities, had reserved a place on the American Atlas Centaur
rocket in case of setbacks in the Arianespace program.
   On May 31, 1986, technicians were forced to destroy an Ariane-2
rocket shortly after liftoff when a problem in the third-stage
ignition caused the rocket to go off course. Arianespace suspended
launches for 16 months following the failure.
   INSAT-1C, constructed by Ford Aerospace, has a lifespan of 10
years. It will expand television and long-distance telephone
service and collect meteorological data. The 2,618-pound satellite
was originally to be carried by an American rocket. But after the
failure of the U.S. space shuttle Challenger, Indian authorities
decided to put their valuable cargo aboard an Ariane.
   The space shuttle program was grounded after seven astronauts
were killed in the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.
   A small leak on the launch pad now threatens to delay the
scheduled September launching of the next U.S. space shuttle
mission by as much as two months, U.S. officials said. Space
shuttle Discovery is scheduled to take a crew of five astronauts
into space.
   Arianespace now hauls half the world's commercial payloads and
holds launch contracts worth $2.5 billion. Eight launches are
scheduled for 1988, with nine launches a year planned beginning in
1989.

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by
former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas seconding the nomination of
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for vice president at the Democratic
National Convention on Thursday night.
   Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
   Thank you. That is quite a greeting.
   We engaged in an important task at a very important time. We are
positioning ourselves for the last decade of the twentieth century.
   Our minds are turning away from, Hooray for Hollywood. And our
minds _ and we are now confronting the hard reality of a nation
which desires to become solvent again.
   Competitive again. A nation which desires to have the trust of
its allies and its compatriots. We want _ we want to retake the
moral high ground. Now, to be what we want to be, to become the
people we want to become, we have to be moved to action by what is
reasonable, sensible, logical and rational.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a sensible, logical and rational choice for
vice president of the United States.
   You know, the people who founded America were very smart. Those
founders warned us not to become overcome by factions, but to rely
on reason as our guide. If we rely on reason as our guide, reason
will temper and tender our emotions.
   Reason will help us to do the right things. Reason will tutor us
toward doing the right things.
   I say that Lloyd Bentsen is a rational and sensible and
reasonable choice.
   Why?
   First of all, he's my senator. And I wasn't planning to come to
this convention for any purpose. But when Lloyd Bentsen was tapped
by Michael Dukakis as his choice for vice president of the United
States, I knew that if Lloyd Bentsen wanted me to come and second
his nomination, I could not resist doing that, and I'm here to do
it tonight.
   You know, Lloyd Bentsen has been in the United States Senate for
almost eighteen years. Lloyd Bentsen is a man who has an instinct
for doing what is right. Lloyd Bentsen does not have to be
pressured and lobbied to do the right thing.
   Now, Robert Bork _ Lloyd Bentsen voted no on that nomination.
And do you know what: Lloyd Bentsen didn't have to be pressured
into voting no for Bork.
   He said _ Lloyd Bentsen: ``Bork will put our civil rights and
our civil liberties at risk, and we cannot afford to do that, and
that's why I vote no.''
   You heard then Rostenkowski tell you about Bentsen's service on
the Finance Committee and now as chairman on the Finance Committee.
Do you realize that the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over
practically everything that affects our lives, the lives of each
and every one of us.
   Lloyd Bentsen is patient and he managed legislation, the trade
legislation involving 24 committees of the House and the Senate,
meeting over eight months, Lloyd Bentsen was patient and moved it
through. Now, the president vetoed it, but Lloyd Bentsen got the
momentum for trade legislation going, and that momentum will not
dissipate lightly.

   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., nominated Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen for vice president Thursday, saying the Texas
millionaire understands the problems of Americans who ``live from
paycheck to paycheck.''
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is one of a few people in public life who is at
home with those who are trying to make it in America and those who
already have,'' the Rostenkowski told the Democratic National
Convention.
   ``He fights for those who seek a better life because he knows
they deserve it,'' said Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee. ``That's what our Democratic Party
is all about, and that's what Lloyd Bentsen stands for.''
   He referred to Bentsen as a legislative partner because the
Texan is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the counterpart
to Rostenkowski's panel. The two have often worked together on tax,
trade and health insurance legislation.
   Rostenkowski said his district on the Northwest Side of Chicago
houses people who ``run our stores, work in our factories, teach
our children, drive our buses and protect our neighborhoods.''
   Many such traditionally Democratic voters switched and supported
Reagan in 1984, contributing to a Republican presidential landslide.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen knows these people and has fought for these
people,'' he said, calling on them to return to the Democratic
fold. ``Come on home where you belong.''
   Rostenkowski called Bentsen straightforward, smart and tough.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen has everything it takes to be one of America's
greatest vice presidents,'' he said.
   He said Bentsen ``believes that no one should get free ride, but
no one should be left behind either.''
   ``Isn't this what we all believe?'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Police seized Bolivia's cocaine kingpin,
Roberto Suarez Gomez, after trekking through jungles all night to
catch him by surprise, asleep at his ranch, the minister of the
interior reported Thursday.
   In Miami, Chief Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Gregorie, said
on hearing the news, ``He's the biggest cocaine producer in the
world. He has enormous acreage in coca plants.''
   Suarez Gomez was flown to La Paz from Trinidad city, where he
was taken after 10 anti-drug police captured him Wednesday morning
at his El Sujo ranch, 25 miles away, Interior Minister Juan Carlos
Duran said.
   El Sujo is one of Suarez Gomez's five ranches in the heart of
the tropical northeastern Beni region.
   Duran said Suarez Gomez was asleep when 10 anti-drug police took
over the ranch, confiscating 20 automatic weapons and arresting two
bodyguards.
   Suarez Gomez, 56, is wanted in Miami on drug trafficking charges
and has been called by authorities the ``godfather'' of Bolivia's
illegal cocaine trade and a major supplier of drugs to the
Medellin, Colombia, drug cartel.
   However, Duran told a news conference that Bolivia will not
extradite Suarez Gomez to the United States, since he already has
been sentenced to 15 years in prison here.
   He said Suarez Gomez had heart problems and would be examined
medically before being presented to the press.
   The 15-year sentence was handed down by a judge earlier this
year. The former rancher-turned-drug baron never showed up for his
trial and was tried, convicted and sentenced in his absence on drug
trafficking charges.
   Bolivia, a nation of 6.7 million people in the center of South
America, produces a third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. and
European markets.
   Until now, Suarez Gomez has used his money and influence to buy
his freedom in Bolivia. He publicly spoke of paying off political
figures and policemen.
   Duran told reporters, ``President Victor Paz Estenssoro says he
is very pleased with Suarez Gomez's arrest and that the fight
against drugs is the top priority of the government.''
   In 1980, the Bolivan Human Rights Association says, Suarez Gomez
helped finance the military coup that overthrew the civilian
government of Lidia Gueiler Tejada, the interim president, and
installed a government that hired Italian, German and Argentine
mercenaries to undertake a campaign of terror.
   Under that right-wing government, headed by Gen. Luis Garcia
Meza, drug traffickers operated with impunity and left-wing
political figures and labor leaders were killed, tortured or
exiled. The mercenaries went after opposition figures and provided
protection to traffickers. Suarez Gomez was considered the main
player on behalf of cocaine traffickers.
   According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, during
and after the 1980 military coup Suarez Gomez became a close
associate of Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez, who offered him
protection from prosecution in return for large sums of money.
   ``I think that Suarez Gomez's arrest shows that Bolivian police
are serious about going after major cocaine traffickers,'' Frank
Macolini, the DEA country attache for Bolivia, said in a telephone
interview.
   The anti-drug police, trained and equipped by the U.S.
government, have consficated over eight tons of cocaine paste in
one year, Duran said.
   Bolivian police assisted by the DEA destroyed two large
cocaine-processing laboratories in the Beni region Wednesday, but
officials did not say whether the labs belonged to Suarez Gomez or
another trafficker.
   DEA spokesman Jack Hook said in Miami that Suarez Gomez was
indicted there in 1980 for conspiracy to peddle 854 pounds of
cocaine, but that Suarez Gomez commonly deals in tons of cocaine.
   ``He's really the same as the upper levels of the Medellin
cartel,'' said Hook. ``He could be considered one of the pioneers
involved in growing, manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the
United States.''
   Hook noted that Medellin cartel leader Carlos Lehder Rivas was
sentenced in Jacksonville, Fla., on Wednesday to life in prison
without parole.
   Last month, the lower house of Bolivia's Congress accused
cocaine kingpins of trying to take over the government and called
for a united front to preserve democracy.
   The government in June closed a radio station and a television
station that broadcast a talk show with Suarez Gomez. On the show,
Suarez Gomez described the U.S. State Department as ``the king of
cocaine, the vice royalty is the government of Bolivia and the
president is a boss at the service of the U.S. government.''
   Bolivia's conservative government said the program slandered Paz
Estenssoro and the government and that it was closing the stations
for a year.
   In 1986, Newsweek magazine, citing sources in Washington, said
Suarez Gomez had a network of connections stretching from the
Amazon basin to Guadalajara, Mexico; Miami and Europe.

   Three years after the summer of his arrest,
Richard Ramirez went on trial Thursday and the long search began
for jurors to judge him on charges he committed 13 grisly murders
and 30 related felonies.
   ``Perhaps you have heard about this case,'' Superior Court Judge
Michael Tynan told 50 prospective jurors at the beginning of an
expected eight-month jury selection process. ``This is the
so-called Night Stalker case.''
   Tynan pointed out Ramirez, a pale, shaggy-haired drifter dressed
in a loose-fitting, doublebreasted, dark blue suit wih a blue
hankerchief in his pocket to match his tie. Ramirez did not
acknowledge the jury prospects and continued to sit with his back
to them at the counsel table.
   Tynan told the group he is looking for ``committed people,
willing to devote from one to two years to the case.
   ``This is a very serious business, a very serious trial,'' he
declared.
   Tynan then began listening to reasons jurors said they were
unable to serve including the inability to get time off from work.
   At least six panelists were dismissed when they declared their
belief in the defendant's guilt. Thirty-two were excused because
their employers would not pay for two years of jury service. After
a half-day of questioning, jury selection recessed until Monday.
   The trial, which had been delayed many times, got under way
after a last defense motion in which Ramirez' lawyers sought to
exclude the press and public from the jury selection.
   An attorney for the Los Angeles Times opposed the motion but the
judge said he had already decided to deny it.
   The State Supreme Court also rejected a defense motion Thursday
to block the trial. Defense lawyers contended jury selection
procedures would keep young people and Hispanics off the panel in
disproportionate numbers.
   ``I am ecstatic about finally going to trial in this case,''
said Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin. ``And I hope we can
move the trial along a little more efficiently than we've attended
to the pretrial affairs.''
   Ramirez, 28, a native of El Paso, Tex., could be sentenced to
die in the gas chamber at San Quentin if he is convicted of the
spree of murders, rapes and assaults.
   Defense attorneys, anticipating extensive questioning of jury
prospects, said it is unlikely a jury will be seated until spring.
   Then, the jurors will settle in to hear from some 1,000
witnesses.
   Attorneys Daniel Hernandez and Arturo Hernandez, who are not
related, say their client is eager to have his case resolved.
   ``He's been ready to go to trial all along. Eager is a good
word,'' said Daniel Hernandez.
   Ramirez was captured and beaten by east Los Angeles residents
during the hot Labor Day weekend of 1985 after his picture appeared
in newspapers as the prime suspect in murders and attacks that had
terrorized Southern Californians.
   Residents locked their windows and bolted their doors against
the random killer, who typically entered homes through unlocked
doors, raped women, killed both men and women and stole jewelry and
other valuables.
   At a preliminary hearing for Ramirez in 1986, anguished
witnesses including several women who had been raped told of
horrific confrontations with the Night Stalker who invaded their
homes, killed their husbands and demanded they ``swear to Satan.''
   Some murders were ghoulish, including one in which the victim's
eyes were gouged out.
   The killer often left behind drawings of pentagrams, inverted
five-point stars often associated with devil worship.
   Ramirez' bizarre courtroom behavior at early hearings fueled
speculation that he was a devil worshiper. He once shouted, ``Hail
Satan!'' and flashed a pentagram drawn on his palm. During the most
grisly testimony at his preliminary hearing, he appeared to giggle.
   But in recent months, he has been content to slump in his
courtroom chair scribbling notes or reading legal papers.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: dissipate lightly.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Bentsen is concerned about health care for the elderly and
the aged and the children and the widows. Lloyd Bentsen cares about
the constituency of the Democratic Party. And he sees to it that
whenever he gets a chance as a member of the United States Senate,
he will vote for those programs that will aid and advance the
health and well-being of those people who are our most vulnerable
citizens.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a proponent of those programs to help those
frail people.
   But I'll tell you something else about Lloyd: he has not been a
spectator in the United States Senate. He has been a doer. An
action man. And he sees to it that action takes place on behalf of
those people who need it the most, and that's why he ought to be _
he must be _ the Democratic nominee for vice president of the
United States.
   Lloyd Bentsen knows that welfare programs don't work. That the
people who need the money don't seem to be there to get it. But he
is there working on welfare reform as a part of his mandate for
action on behalf of the people in the United States Senate.
   I wish _ I wish you knew Lloyd Bentsen as I know Lloyd Bentsen.
If you knew him as I do, you would join me on this podium tonight,
and each of you would urge the nomination of this man for vice
president.
   Lloyd Bentsen recognized that civil rights and human rights
needed the attention of people in the United States Senate. He knew
that civil rights and human rights need the attention of the
governors of America long before a Civil Rights Bill of 1964. He
opened the doors of his public accommodations facilities to
minorities long before there was a public accommodations section to
the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   And, do you remember down South, we used to have a poll tax, a
poll tax to keep minority people from being able to vote? Lloyd
Bentsen voted against the poll tax long before anybody thought
about removing it from the government ...
   It is a mistake for you to label Lloyd Bentsen. The media and
others have already tried to label him. They call him a ``Tory
Democrat.'' A conservative. A businessman. They call him a man who
is at odds with the liberal faction of the Democratic Party. But I
would simply say to you tonight, don't try to label Lloyd Bentsen.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a good American. And he believes _ and he
believes in the principles of the Democratic Party just like you do.
   Lloyd Bentsen believes in public service. He believes in the
public service ethic. And he does not believe that you go into
public service to get rich. You go into public service to serve
people.
   I believe that Lloyd Bentsen will be a good vice president
because he believes in this country, and he wants to do what is
right, and he has an instinct for doing what's right.
   Lloyd Bentsen believes with one of the ancient Greek
philosophers, Aristotle. Aristotle said in The Politics, ``If
liberty and equality as it is thought be some is chiefly found in
democracies, they will be best attained when all persons alike
share in the government to the utmost.'' Lloyd Bentsen believes
that.
   Lloyd Bentsen would say, with Adlai Stevenson, ``Democracy
cannot be saved by supermen, but only by the unswerving devotion
and goodness of millions of middlemen.'' Lloyd Bentsen believes
that.
   He is a sensible, reasonable, rational, common sense, good
choice for vice president of the United States. And I believe that
he is the best choice you could come up with to give us a strong
and winning ticket this November.
   I am pleased and I am proud to second the nomination of Lloyd
Bentsen.
   Thank you very much.

   A pilot who crashed into a farm field and
blacked out as the plane hurtled toward a steep ravine says an
800-pound Hereford gave its life saving him and his three
passengers.
   ``The cow saved our lives, no doubt,'' said pilot John Lozano.
``We would have smashed up real bad.''
   The cow was hit by the plane, limped away and later died. Lozano
reimbursed farmer Sam Jahnke $1,500 for the animal.
   ``That's the best $1,500 I ever spent,'' Lozano said, estimating
that otherwise the plane would have headed into the ravine at about
60 mph.
   Lozano was on a pleasure flight from Cass County, Mo., to
Junction City, Kan., June 4 when he determined the runway at
Junction City was not long enough for his Beechcraft Bonanza.
   The engine stalled as Lozano decided to fly to Manhattan, about
10 miles away. Between hills on his left and right, Lozano spotted
a flat area in Jahnke's field and put the plane down.
   The last thing Lozano remembers seeing is the ravine coming up
and a group of cows standing around a tree. ``I thought, `Oh ...'
and I blacked out,'' he said.

   Authorities on Wednesday said they confiscated
several counterfeit delegate credentials being worn by persons in
the Pennsylvania delegation.
   One volunteer working for the Pennsylvania state committee was
leaving the floor when a security person noticed she was wearing a
fake credential, confiscated it and removed the volunteer from the
convention arena, said Karen Balaban, counsel to the state
committee.
   She said the volunteer was handed the credential by a woman
while they were riding to the convention center from the suburban
hotel where the delegation is staying.
   Security officials then checked the entire delegation and five
people were escorted from the center, said Pennsylvania state
chairman Larry Yatch.
   After the discovery, security was tightened at the entrances to
The Omni, site of the Democratic gathering, with credentials being
scanned by special laser devices to check for authenticity.
   Yatch said he explained to security that a number of people
without credentials had wanted to get into the Omni to hear
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey address the convention.
   ``It was just people who were a little over zealous,'' Yatch
said.

<TEXT>
   National strikes, accompanied by guerrilla
violence, have crippled the vital mining industry and seriously
affected other industrial activity.
   A two-day general strike to protest soaring inflation was
declared illegal. Police used tear gas and water cannons Wednesday
to disperse strikers who piled rocks and burning mounds of garbage
to block highways around Lima.
   Labor Minister Orestes Rodriguez declared the general strike a
failure and said less than 30 percent of Peru's 7 million workers
participated. He said strikers would be docked three days' pay.
   Late Wednesday police lifted their blockade of the headquarters
of the General Confederation of Peruvian Workers, which had called
the strike. Traffic and police presence around Lima returned to
normal as the strike wound down.
   The General Confederation said riot police shot and wounded 23
strikers and arrested 740 since the action began Tuesday. Most
wounds were from buckshot and minor, but three people were hit by
bullets, the federation said.
   Police said 30 people were arrested in Lima but reported no
serious injuries.
   Fish, chicken and vegetables were in short supply in Lima
markets and stores Wednesday because of the strike.
   Guerrillas of the Shining Path, a Maoist group that began
fighting eight years ago, killed seven policemen, wounded five and
assassinated a judge in attacks across the country Monday and
Tuesday.
   Police said it was not clear whether the Shining Path was acting
in conjunction with the strike, but said leftist guerrillas
supporting the work stoppage had bombed buildings in several cities
and planted a car bomb in Lima that wounded three passersby.
   A strike by the National Federation of Mine, Metal and
Steelworkers was in its third day Wednesday, forcing silver prices
up on world markets. No violence has been reported at the mines.
   The union said 85 percent of mining operations were shut down,
but industry spokesmen put the figure at 50 percent to 60 percent.
   Officials said Cerro de Pasco and Buenaventure, which together
produce about 8 million ounces of silver a year, were paralyzed but
operations continued at Peru's largest silver mines, Orcata and
Orcopampa, and several smaller producers.
   Peru is second in world silver production and a major source of
copper, lead and zinc. Mining output traditionally accounts for
more than half the nation's income.
   Union spokesmen said copper production had ceased at Cajone and
Toquepala, two principal mines of the U.S.-owned South Peru Copper
Corp.
   Industry spokesmen said operations at state-run Centromin,
Peru's largest mining company were partially affected and the La
Oroya smelter, the nation's most important, continued working.
   Minero Peru, a state company that operates copper mines and zinc
and copper refineries, said operations were normal.
   The mine union, which claims 75 percent of the nation's
estimated 100,000 mine workers as members, said the strike is
intended to force mine companies to negotiate all contracts at the
same time. The government has refused.
   Alberto Ramirez, spokesman for the general union federation,
said the 48-hour strike closed 80 percent of the factories, stores
and businesses in Lima and a slightly smaller percentage elsewhere.
   It was the third general strike against the 3-year-old
government of President Alan Garcia, head of the governing
center-left Aprista party.
   It was called to protest austerity measures imposed this month,
which include increases in food prices ranging from 20 percent to
100 percent. Inflation is expected to reach 400 percent this year.
   The federation says it represents 90 percent of the 1.6 million
unionized workers.

   Negotiators have resolved a long-standing
trade dispute over Japanese import quotas on 11 categories of
American processed food products, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter announced Wednesday.
   ``I am pleased that we were able to finally reach an ...
agreement to implement the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade) report which ruled that Japan's quotas were illegal under
international trading rules,'' Yeutter said in a statement issued
by his office.
   Yeutter said the agreement ``sets a precedent for other pending
cases we have before the GATT in which the United States is denied
access to foreign agricultural markets.''
   ``It is a further example that with persistence and
perserverence the United States can open markets abroad for our
products,'' he said, noting that some products had been severely
restricted or prohibited in Japan for more than two decades.
   Under the three-year settlement, Japan will eliminate import
quotas on products including ice cream, frozen yogurt and processed
cheese; sugar syrups; fruit puree and paste; fruit pulp; non-citrus
fruit juices; tomato juice and ketchup.

   A vice officer shot twice during a robbery
attempt at an adult bookstore begged an assailant not to shoot him
a third time, but the gunman fired anyway, killing him, police said
Wednesday.
   Houston Police Officer Elston Howard, who was to married in two
weeks, was behind the counter with a clerk at the 24-hour bookstore
late Tuesday writing a citation when the gunman walked in, police
said.
   Howard, 26, was not in uniform but wore a police raid jacket
with HPD on it and had his gun, said homicide Sgt. John Silva. The
gunman shot Howard when the officer looked up.
   Howard struggled briefly with the gunman then fell to the floor,
Silva said. The officer never drew his gun.
   Witnesses told police the gunman stood over Howard as the
officer begged him not to shoot again, but he did anyway.
   ``It was just a straight, cold-blooded execution,'' Silva said.
   ``(The gunman) was in the process of conducting an aggravated
robbery and the last thing he expected to see was an HPD officer,''
Silva said. ``So, instead of bailing out, he just went ahead and
shot the officer.''
   The gunman then robbed the clerk, telling him, ``Give me the
money or you're going to be next,'' Silva said. The man fled in a
vehicle with a small amount of cash.
   Howard's partner was in the process of moving their unmarked
police car when the shooting occurred and did not realize what had
happened, police said.
   Howard, shot three times, was pronounced dead at Ben Taub
Hospital. He had been with the police department for five years.
   Police believe the gunman also may have been involved in the
robbery of another adult book store earlier Tuesday. No arrests had
been made in the case late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Anglicans' No. 2 Leader Proposes Compromise on Women Bishops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop of York John Habgood, the
Church of England's second-ranking prelate, said Wednesday that
Anglicans agonizing over the issue of women bishops should
compromise by allowing them to ordain priests _ but only with a
male bishop present.
   Habgood spoke amid warnings that the worldwide Anglican
Communion of faithful in 164 countries could break up if U.S.
Episcopalians consecrate their first woman bishop.
   ``I have a very simple suggestion, and that is whenever a woman
bishop ordains (a priest), a male bishop should ordain with her,''
Habgood said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview.
   ``I would say that women bishops would then be acceptable within
the Council of the church and recognized as having a place in the
next Lambeth Conference and so forth. I think that is a possible
compromise.''
   Other church leaders made no immediate response to Habgood's
proposal.
   The current Lambeth Conference of 525 bishops representing the
world's 70 million Anglicans has been overshadowed by the
controversy over admission of women priests by some Anglican
churches.
   The conference, held once every 10 years, was due to debate the
issue of women priests on Friday. The three-week conference opened
in this cathedral city in southeastern England on Sunday.
   The Church of England has so far refused to ordain women as
priests, but it is deeply divided on the question.
   The issue involving 2.5 million U.S. Episcopalians centers on
whether the church would accept a priest ordained by a woman
bishop. Some Church of England leaders say they would, others say
they could not.
   Habgood ranks second in the Church of England hierarchy behind
the state church's spiritual leader, Archbishop of Canterbury
Robert Runcie.
   Runcie, who leads the world's Anglicans without the kind of
formal authority the pope exercises over Roman Catholics, warned
Monday that the Anglican church worldwide was endangered by an
``unholy conflict'' over women priests and bishops.
   ``We need to recognize that our unity is threatened over the
ordination of women to the priesthood and episcopate in whatever we
ultimately decide to do,'' he told the conference in a keynote
speech.
   A minority of the 27 self-governing Anglican churches in the
world, including U.S. Episcopalians and Canada, have admitted women
to the priesthood since 1977. But they have so far stopped short of
permitting women bishops.

   Officers responding to a disturbance call
Wednesday shot and killed a man who police say opened fire and
engaged in a running gun battle with the lawmen.
   The man, whose name was not immediately released, was pronounced
dead at Baylor University Medical Center late Wednesday afternoon,
said hospital administrator Katherine Wright. The man suffered
gunshot wounds to the upper chest, neck and leg, she said.
   No officers were wounded, said Sgt. A.J. Crawford.
   The officers responding to the call encountered two men who were
firing guns and fled from police, said Lt. J. Calame. Three
officers chased the suspects through an alley for several blocks,
exchanging gunfire during the chase, he said.
   The second man was taken into custody, police said.
   Police cordoned off several blocks of a heavily traveled road
that remained closed through much of the night.
   Dallas police have drawn criticism from minority group leaders
for being too quick to shoot at suspects. Last summer, a
congressional subcommittee conducted a hearing into the
department's use of deadly force, prompted by white officers' 1986
slayings of two elderly blacks in unrelated cases.
   Three Dallas police officers were shot this year, sparking a
backlash of support for police. Then-Police Chief Billy Prince
fueled controversy when he said criticism of the department by
members of the City Council had fostered an atmosphere of hostility
to police.

   Organizers are distributing tickets
for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1988 Olympics with
the aid of computers and darts.
   The Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee said a lottery using the
so-called Multiplicative Congruent Method was held for almost 14
hours at the Korea Exchange Bank Wednesday to draw winning numbers
of Koreans who applied for tickets.
   Organizers said that in the lottery, they first picked three
numerals by having people shoot darts into a wooden wheel with
numbers on. The three figures were fed into a computer to come up
with winning numbers.
   The lottery was used to decide who gets about 40,000 tickets for
the two ceremonies. About 967,000 people requested opening ceremony
tickets _ or 48.3 people for every ticket.
   Another 20,000 tickets for each event went on sale overseas last
October, with prices ranging from $40 to $200.
   The Olympics are scheduled for Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet soldier who took refuge in Canada after
his release by Afghan rebels returned home and told other deserters
abroad that he suffered no reprisals, an official report said
Wednesday.
   Nikolai Golovin, 25, flew to Moscow late Monday on an Aeroflot
flight from Montreal and met with journalists, the news agency Tass
said.
   Golovin was one of five Soviet soldiers captured and held by
Afghan rebels, then spirited away by Canadian officials on a secret
mission in November 1986.
   He was working part-time at a meat processing plant in
Kitchener, Ontario, but he complained that he never felt at home in
Canada.
   Efforts to bring the Soviet deserters to Canada began in July
1984 when Toronto lawyer Serge Jusyp met with several of them in
Afghanistan. Jusyp, who was acting on behalf of the Holy Trinity
Russian Orthodox Church in Toronto, persuaded rebel leaders to
release the men if Canada offered asylum. ``My comrades staying in
Canada should know that nothing has happened to me after my return
home,'' Tass quoted Golovin as saying. ``I believe that fear of a
possible punishment keeps them there.''
   He said the deserters had been warned by their Canadian contacts
that they would face reprisals if they returned to the Soviet Union.
   The former soldier said those fears have been alleviated by
Soviet Prosecutor-General Alexander Sukharev's declaration of
amnesty for soldiers who ``had been unable to suffer any longer
tortures and privations of captivity and committed wrongdoings to
the detriment of the USSR.''
   Golovin told reporters before leaving Canada that he wanted to
return to where Russian was spoken and to see his sister and ailing
mother. He planned to find work as an electrician in his home town
of Ulyanovsk, a city on the Volga River 500 miles east of Moscow.
   The Soviets are now withdrawing their more than 110,000 troops
from Afghanistan.

   Oliver L. North was the target of a potential
assassination plot that involved one of eight men charged with
illegal pro-Libyan activities in the United States, an
administration source says.
   The man, Mousa Hawamda, is a naturalized American who was
identified Wednesday at an arraignment hearing for six of those
arrested in the alleged scheme, which prosecutors said involved
diversion of Libyan funds to support anti-American activities.
   Hawamda was described as a Libyan intelligence operative who
operates under the guise of a Washington travel agency owner.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said that based on information
received by the FBI, Hawamda ``was involved in a potential plot to
assassinate a high government official of the United States.''
Hudson did not identify the official or give any other details.
   But another official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said the target was North, a former National Security
Council aide and a major figure in the Iran-Contra arms and money
scandal.

   A federal judge says America was
sending a signal to drug traffickers when he sentenced Carlos
Lehder Rivas to life imprisonment without parole for smuggling tons
of cocaine into the United States.
   ``Cocaine is viewed as a national tragedy in this country,''
U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton told the Colombian drug dealer
Wednesday. ``Those who profit from this are the worst kinds of
offenders.''
   The harsh sentence, life plus 135 years in prison and fines
totaling $350,000, was ``a signal of our society'' that it will
strongly punish those fueling ``this cancer'' of drugs, Melton said.

   A consumer health group is criticizing the
Food and Drug Administration for proposing to allow continued use
of sulfites, which the group says can make food deadly to more than
a million Americans.
   An unpublished memo from FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young rejects
proposals to outlaw the preservative chemicals in foods not now
covered by a limited ban and to require labeling of
sulfite-containing foods served in restaurants.
   The memo to Health and Human Services Director Otis Bowen,
obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, proposes to keep
sulfites in the category ``GRAS,'' or ``generally recognized as
safe.'' A ban on their use on fresh fruits and vegetables would
remain in effect and a further ban applying to previously exempted
fresh potatoes is expected by the end of the year.

   A Thai prince has come here to try to settle a
prolonged tug-of-war over an ancient relic at the Art Institute of
Chicago that Bangkok claims was illegally removed from the country
22 years ago.
   The 900-year-old stone sculpture _ called a lintel, or
crosspiece over a door or window _ has inspired protests from
Chicago to Bangkok by Thais who claim it is an important cultural
icon that was whisked out of their country.
   The Art Institute, however, says it was a gift from a
foundation, bought legally in Bangkok in 1966.
   ``It's become a little political football,'' Art Institute
Director James N. Wood said Wednesday. He was to meet today with
Prince Subhadradis Diskul, an expert in art and archeology, who
arrived here late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Top Soviet Heavy Metal Rockers Play First Concert in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the Soviet Union, the five young
Moscow rockers who make up Black Coffee rank as the nation's
premier heavy metal heroes, boasting the country's two best-selling
rock records.
   But if a recent concert in Madrid _ their first in the West _ is
any indication, their Western counterparts need not worry about
developing strategic defenses.
   The group, led by energetic frontman and singer Dmitri
Varshavsky, 24, managed to attract an audience of 2,000 in the
large open-air stadium where they played a deafening hour-long set.
Their soundman had asked Spanish officials for political asylum
earlier in the day.
   The rock critic of the daily Diario 16 condescendingly described
their music as ``orthodox.''
   In concert, however, the group generated sparks from die-hard,
leather-garbed rock fans, mainly through Varshavsky's
irrespressible screams and growls, reminiscent of Ozzy Osborne or
the Australian heavy metal group AC@DC, and the inspired pounding
of drummer Sergei Chernyakov, 29.
   In the Soviet Union, the group is responsible for the two
top-selling rock recordings: the album ``Over the Threshold'' and
the four-song disc ``Black Coffee,'' both recorded last year, group
manager Ovanes Melik-Pashaev said in an interview.
   After the Spanish gig, he said, Black Coffee has set its sights
on other countries, especially the United States, and is rehearsing
songs in English to record and perform in the West.
   Melik-Pashaev said he is talking with a Dallas promoter called
Sovitex, Inc. to arrange a U.S. tour this summer to include stops
in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco and perhaps Chicago and
Washington.
   Despite his pre-concert claims that Black Coffee plays ``melodic
hard-rock with touches of heavy metal thrown in,'' on stage the
group's grinding, ear-splitting, double-lead guitar attack sounded
similar to aggressive Western bands such as Def Lepard.
   But unlike Western bands that spout tough lyrics and glamorize
violent attitudes, Black Coffee promotes ``peace, friendship and
happiness,'' singer Varshavsky said through an interpreter.
   ``Our songs are very optimistic. They speak of the struggle
between good and evil, with good triumphing over bad,'' he said.
   Melik-Pashaev said there was no censorship of lyrics but added
the group doesn't like to use offensive words ``or the language of
criminals.''
   Varshavsky said the group has not been influenced by any
particular Western band but expressed admiration for Black Sabbath,
Led Zeppelin and Whitesnake.
   Melik-Pashaev described the group's repertoire as ``rock for
peace'' that stays clear of political references.
   ``But rock is a social phenomenon, so in an indirect way the
group can't help but be political,'' the manager said.
   The high point of the concert came during the obligatory drum
solo, which went on for six minutes and stirred the crowd to chant
in unison.
   Other members of the group are Sergui Kudishin, 29, lead guitar;
Igor Kupriyanov, 24, bass guitar; and Igor Andreev, 23, rhythm
guitar.
   The group was formed in December 1986. Since then, it has gone
from playing clubs in Moscow to recording for the state-run
Melodiya label, touring the Soviet Union and frequent appearances
on the Soviet television youth shows ``The Look '' and ``Tomorrow's
Mail.''
   The group appeared in Madrid at the invitation of the municipal
government which promoted the concert as part of the city's annual
festival in honor of St. Isidro the Laborer, the city's patron
saint.
   Madrid police said 38-year-old soundman Samouil Savitsky's
request for political asylum had been granted on a provisional
basis. Speaking through the interpreter, members of the group said
they didn't understand his action but did not elaborate.
   J. Perez de Albeniz, rock critic for Spain's leading daily, the
left-of-center El Pais, had nothing but harsh words for
Melik-Peshaev, saying he didn't let the musicians speak freely to
reporters. The critic wrote that the manager ``was a master of the
art of talking without saying anything.''
   Melik-Pashev, a serious, black-bearded 38-year-old, said the
group's success was due as much to the policies of ``glasnost''
(openness) and ``perestroika'' (economic restructuring) championed
by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as to its music.
   He said some 5,000 rock groups had emerged in the Soviet Union
in the last two years, and Melodiya is doing more rock recording
and giving the Soviet rockers a greater opportunity to obtain
instruments, especially highly coveted Fender and Gibson guitars.
   Some of the American instruments cost $2,000, he said, but
cheaper copies have become easier to acquire at secondhand music
shops.
   The group's stage show is austere by Western standards. Bassist
Kupriyanov, by far the fanciest dresser, showed off his black
Michael Jackson-like military jacket embroidered in gold and swung
the gold epaulets from side to side while running to and fro on
stage.

<HEAD>British Telly Hopes to Fill Writers' Strike Void in United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television producers from the land of such PBS
hits as ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' are hoping the 4{-month-old
writers' strike will give them a chance to break into the lucrative
commercial network market this fall.
   The three major U.S. commercial networks have been forced to
postpone new shows scheduled for this fall because no scripts have
been written. NBC and CBS have indicated an interest in buying
British programs to help fill the void.
   So far, the networks are merely browsing. Difficulties in
translating British shows into the style of fast-paced,
star-studded American airwaves may inhibit many import deals.
   ``We've had a lot of increased interest,'' said Vivian Wallace,
chief executive of Manchester-based Granada, one of the largest of
the 16 independent television companies that broadcast over the
country's two commercial channels. The non-commercial British
Broadcasting Corp. runs two other national channels.
   ``I can't report any brilliant coups,'' she added in an
interview. ``Things we have sold in the past to the Public
Broadcasting System market are probably too slow-paced for the
networks, but obviously we are using the opportunity to pitch
projects which may be possible.
   ``Everybody would love to sell to the networks because the money
is much higher.''
   Peter Clark, a director of the international sales subsidiary of
one of Britain's largest independent companies, Television South
PLC, said U.S. networks ``are starting to look, to investigate.''
   But ``they're going to have to take creative risks if they want
to use programming from other sources,'' said Clark, whose parent
company has just purchased MTM, the U.S. production company
co-founded by actress Mary Tyler Moore.
   Rather than completed programs, however, scripts, co-productions
and convertible formats have a better chance of traveling to U.S.
television, officials said.
   They point to the long-running American hit series ``All in the
Family,'' which was based on a British show called ``Till Death Us
Do Part,'' whose bigoted Londoner, Alf Garnett, became Archie
Bunker.
   John Reynolds, head of the BBC's U.S. subsidiary, Lionheart,
says he is talking to all three networks about sales of
mini-series, comedies and movies, either as finished programs or
formats.
   Speaking from his New York office, Reynolds said, ``Obviously
the American networks' current difficulties could present
opportunities to the BBC.''
   The strike by the 9,500-member Writers Guild of America began in
March against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers over disputed payments for domestic and foreign
television reruns.
   Increasingly bitter over the weeks, it has caused layoffs among
California's 230,000 entertainment industry workers.
   In the past, most British programming in the United States has
been sold to cable or public television stations. Non-profit PBS
carries so many British shows that some in Britain call it the
``Principally British Service.''
   ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' the story of the family and servants
in an Edwardian household, was a London Weekend Television
production that ran for 68 episodes on PBS.
   In January, a BBC soap opera called ``Eastenders'' had a trial
run on 19 PBS stations. Despite warnings that the Cockney slang
would prove unintelligible to Americans, the show still airs and
has been snapped up by 10 other stations, said Ian Duncan of BBC's
commercial arm.
   But the commercial networks are different.
   ``It's been very difficult for English programming to get into
the networks,'' said Jay Blumler, a New York-born professor who
holds posts at the Center for TV Research at the University of
Leeds and the University of Maryland.
   ``The English are very good at producing classic serials and
dramas, but that's not the sort of thing that the American networks
have commonly geared up to.''
   Clark said American producers prefer U.S. television stars, U.S.
locations, and a fast pace.
   ``In our dramas, we tend to develop the character much more,''
he said.
   Another potential problem is that British television is
generally far more permissive about foul language, sex and nudity.
   Industry officials said the strike may accelerate a growing
trend toward U.S.-British co-productions, which they say Americans
prefer because it gives them control over the show.
   Although British stations do air U.S. shows, most said they had
not been caught short yet because of the strike.

<HEAD>New Leadership Seeks to Change Course for Taiwan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 94 years in the grip of Chiang
Kai-shek and his family, the long-ruling Nationalist Party has a
new leadership that hopes to steer Taiwan from the authoritarian
and uncompromising ways of its past.
   The changes at the top and in direction came at the party's
recent 13th congress in Taipei.
   Ever since the government of Chiang Kai-shek was driven to
Taiwan from mainland China in 1949 by Mao Tse-tung's Communists,
the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, has been consumed by an
undying dream of returning to govern the world's most populous
nation.
   While the congress vowed to keep that dream alive, it cautiously
acknowledged the need to replace its aging party elders who date
from the Chiang days on the mainland to a more dynamic leadership
aware of the need for democratic change at home and pragmatism in
dealing with mainland China.
   The new thinking comes as the mainland Chinese have been making
radical changes of their own, including overtures to Taiwan for a
one-nation, two-systems type of arrangment they made with the
British on capitalist Hong Kong.
   The Nationalist Party's new leadership unveiled at the congress
clearly showed power is shifting to native Taiwanese, who
constitute 85 percent of this prosperous island's nearly 20 million
people.
   President Lee Teng-hui was acclaimed the first native Taiwanese
leader of the party. That helped consolidate his power base that
was virtually non-existant when he succeeded Chiang Ching-kuo, the
eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, as head of government upon his death
in January. The elder Chiang died in 1975.
   The party's policy-making Central Standing Committee, long
dominated by mainland Chinese, for the first time has a native
Taiwanese majority.
   Giving more power to native Taiwanese was part of a sweeping
liberalization program that began with Chiang Ching-kuo, the final
ruler of the Chiang family dynasty.
   Shortly before his death, Chiang Ching-Kuo lifted martial law,
allowed the formation of opposition political parties and ended a
38-year ban on travel to China to allow family reunions.
   President Lee has promised to continue the liberalization
process but may proceed with caution since his new 31-member
Central Standing Committee still contains some party elders who
remain unenthusiastic about a quick pace of change.
   ``We don't believe drastic change will benefit society,'' the
party's 38-year-old deputy-secretary general, Ma Ying-jeou, told
reporters at the end of the congress.
   The major unresolved political issue is overhauling the
parliamentary system in which aging Nationalists elected in
mainland China before 1949 hold a majority of seats as a symbol of
the party's claim to rule the country.
   In the Legislative Yuan, the highest lawmaking body, the Old
Guard has an advantage of about 2-to-1 over Taiwan-elected
legislators.
   Ma said that through retirement of party elders and an increase
in the number of seats contested on the island, the ratio of
holdovers to Taiwan-elected lawmakers should be about equal after
elections in late 1989.
   After another three years, Taiwan-elected representatives should
hold a 2-to-1 edge, he said.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, however, has staged
street demonstrations in support of opening all seats to elections,
actions that elicited expressions of caution from the Nationalists
on the need to maintain law and order.
   Under pressure from the new generation of leaders, the party
congress adopted a more practical approach to dealing with the
mainland. Ma described the new policy as providing ``much more
flexibility to what we had been doing before.''
   The Kuomintang, which once sent ballons across the Taiwan Strait
with handbills urging an uprising against ``Communist bandits,''
now will try to influence their compatriots by taking the ``Taiwan
experience'' of economic prosperity and growing democracy to China.
   The ban on travel to Taiwan from China also has been eased. The
Nationalists also will tolerate imports of Chinese raw material and
the export of Taiwan investment to the mainland so long as the
business is conducted through a third country.
   ``There is no way we can control indirect investment, as well as
indirect trade,'' Ma said.
   The point of the new flexibility, according to the policy
statement, is ``to utilize our political and economic influence to
win the support of our mainland compatriots.''
   The changing face of the Kuomintang prompted a leading member of
Taiwan's opposition party to acknowledge the ruling party's new
dynamism.
   Huang Huang-hsiung, a lawmaker from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, acknowledged that his party ``is facing a new
challenge from the restructured Kuomintang.''
   ``But I believe the condition is better for democratization
now,'' he said. ``We can better pressure them to compete with us on
equal footing.''

<HEAD>East-West Clash: U.S. Workers At Japanese, Korean Firms Claim Job
Bias</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Carlson had a good job, a huge house and a stable life in
Arizona when he traded it all for a dream offer in Silicon Valley.
He thought he was kicking off a fresh new career. Two months later,
he was out of work.
   Mikel Duffy hoped to climb the ladder of high finance with a new
job at a New York export-import firm. A year later, convinced she'd
never reach the first rung, she quit.
   Two tales of job troubles. One West Coast, one East Coast. One
veteran, one beginner. But both are among the small but increasing
number of Americans who've accused their Japanese or Korean
employers of job discrimination.
   The explosion of Asian-owned companies has created jobs for
Americans but has also generated complaints from workers claiming
they were rejected, denied promotion or laid off because of their
color, race, sex or ethnic group.
   ``You should be evaluated for your performance _ not what you
look like, who you are or your race or sex,'' said Duffy, one of
three women who've sued C. Itoh & Co. (America) Inc., a Japanese
company, for discrimination.
   Some say cultural clashes arise because the Japanese are
unaccustomed to minority workers and female managers. Others call
it intentional bias.
   Some complaints are in court. The government is investigating
others. Some probes have led to financial settlements and new
policies.
   Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., for example, agreed this
spring to pay $6 million to 377 blacks and women after a
3{-year-long investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission concluded the company should have hired them sooner.
Honda admitted no wrongdoing.
   Most complaints involve Japanese companies, simply because of
their dominance of the U.S. market. The cases represent a tiny
fraction of 190,000 Americans working for Japanese-owned firms, a
number expected to rise to 900,000 by 1995. As of 1986, 539
Japanese manufacturing firms had been established in the United
States.
   Many business experts insist the Japanese generally are good
bosses, known for innovative management and fierce loyalty from
workers.
   Still, tensions have surfaced when East meets West in the
workplace. Some say it's because the Japanese live in a homogeneous
society and male-oriented work world.
   ``They import their own cultural bias,'' said lawyer Lewis
Steel, whose firm has been involved in three cases in which women
have charged Japanese companies with job discrimination.
   ``They run their corporations (here) in a way that really
mirrors the structure in Japan,'' he said. ``They have to adapt to
our culture. ... It is not easy for them to do that. It was not
easy for companies in the South to rid themselves of overt
discrimination.''
   Labor experts note that the record of U.S. firms isn't
unblemished. In 1983, for instance, General Motors settled a race
and sex discrimination case for $42 million, the EEOC said.
   Bias complaints, some pending for two years, include:
   _ Hirings: Two former executives of NEC Electronics Inc., a
microprocessor and semiconductor firm, claim they were unfairly
demoted. They assert they'd advised against a policy of dismissing
Americans to make room for Japanese workers. When the company
removed them from the board of directors, they filed suit and then
were fired, according to their breach-of-contract suit.
   ``They had opposed discrimination and they were retaliated
against. They were whistleblowers,'' said attorney Robert Kahn. An
NEC lawyer denies the claims.
   _ Firings: Nine former workers, mostly engineers, have sued
Hyundai Electronics America, claiming they were hired to begin a
computer division in California but lost their jobs when it closed
months later in 1984, although Koreans were transferred within the
organization.
   The EEOC has also sued the Korean-owned firm, charging
discrimination in favor of Korean workers. A lawyer for Hyundai
denies the charges, noting the Koreans were trainees, in America
temporarily.
   Ex-employees aren't mollified. ``I disrupted my life to join
them,'' said Carlson, adding he was laid off two months after being
guaranteed job security. ``They got whatever they wanted from us,
and they let us go.''
   _ Promotions: The EEOC in New York is investigating claims
Japanese men get preferential treatment and women have no promotion
opportunities at The Nikko Securities Co. International Inc., said
attorney Susan Ritz, who is representing three women.
   In the separate case against C. Itoh, Duffy said she was hired
as a clerk two years ago and soon given other duties. When when she
requested relief from clerical work to tackle new tasks, she said
she was told ``in a fatherly, reassuring manner, `No, no, it's OK,
if you feel you can't handle this, you can go back to your old job
and we can get a man to do yours.'''
   The EEOC, however, found no discrimination at C. Itoh and
``anyone who possesses the proper job-related skills can be
promoted,'' said lawyer Bill Carmell, representing the company. ``I
get a little frustrated (with the attitude) since we're a Japanese
company, we must have mistreated women.''
   Another sex discrimination case was resolved in a 1987
multi-million dollar settlement involving Sumitomo Corp. of America
and 13 female clerical workers. Sumitomo stipulated it hadn't
violated laws.
   That settlement ended 10 years of litigation, including a 1982
Supreme Court decision holding that subsidiaries of Japanese firms
in the United States are bound by American laws barring job bias.
   Three Japanese automakers also have come under EEOC scrutinty.
The agency said:
   _ Nissan is discussing settlement of a race, sex and age
discrimination charge.
   _ Toyota last year agreed to add five minority workers at two
California plants and pay $47,880 after a race and national origin
discrimination probe.
   _ Honda in 1987 agreed to pay $457,111 to 85 people following an
age bias investigation.
   In March, Honda settled a case after the EEOC claimed its hiring
practices were discriminatory. In its early years, Honda, based in
Marysville, Ohio, hired only people who lived within a 20-mile
radius of the plant. The radius was later increased to 30 miles,
and the policy was also applied when Honda opened an engine plant
at Anna, Ohio.
   The 30-mile limit excluded potential workers from Columbus, 35
miles away, which has the region's largest minority population _
about 24 percent.
   Honda spokesman Bill Lambert said the Marysville area had asked
the automaker to hire locally because manufacturing layoffs and
closings in the early '80s had put thousands out of work.
   But Florence Warren, Columbus affirmative-action administrator,
said, ``Thirty miles is ludicrous. If you can get to work and you
can apply for a job, you ought to be hired on your merit.''
   Honda last fall expanded its hiring area to 17 counties and
agreed to recruit and advertise in Columbus and implement new
training programs. Some 3.4 percent of Honda's 5,700 ``associates''
are black, Lambert said.
   Experts say the Japanese will adjust quickly, but Carlson, now a
consultant, feels cheated.
   ``If I was going to Korea and opened up a little business,
solicited help from senior technology people and closed it all down
and left them stranded, my guess is ... an iron boot would remove
me summarily,'' he said.
   ``I was wooed and pursued in this job with great vigor. They
just kind of deposited me. The whole thing just stinks.''

   This is Curtis Carlson weekend in Minneapolis
and St. Paul, and thousands of folks there will go back over his
incredible career and attempt, but fail, to capture the essence of
the man.
   No shame on their part. How do you explain a man wh began with
an unproven idea and 50 borrowed dollars in the Great Depression
and erected an empire of 75 companies, employing 50,000 people,
doing more than $4 billion a year in sales?
   They'll try, all 4,000 who attend a sit-down gourmet dinner at
the St. Paul Civic Center prepared by chefs from his own
restaurants and hotels. And all the top executives of the various
companies, among them:
   _Carslon Marketing Group, the largest motivation company in the
world, offering incentive marketing, training and the like to some
of the best-known corporations.
   _Carlson Promotion Group, which creates programs to stimulate
sales and capture customer loyalty for blue chip and other
companies.
   _Carlson Hospitality Group, a major force in the world's hotel,
resort and restaurant industries, including the 160-property
Radisson Hotel Corp., Colony Hotels and Resorts, TGI Friday's and
other well-known names.
   _Carlson Travel Group, North America's largest travel
organization, with more than 600 outlets and 3,500 travel
professionals.
   Every employee has a story. Perhaps everyone who has met the
affable but obviously hard-knuckled Carlson has a tale, but none
can reveal anything but a brief flash against the facade of an
intricately, ingeniously packed 74 years.
   The comments came in advance this week, ``almost like
obituaries,'' he said as preparations progressed for the big event.
There are no obits for Carlson; there are many beginnings. This
50th anniversary itself is one.
   ``All the boys signed declarations,'' he said this week. ``We
have four operating groups for the various companies, and each
group has a number of presidents. Each president signed, their
staffs, too.''
   What they signed were promises to employ all their resources in
raising revenues to more than $9 billion a year in 1992. ``Each has
a goal,'' Carlson said. ``Each knows what he has to do.''
   It's a tradition. When Carlson formed his first company, Gold
Bond (Trading) Stamp Co. that serviced grocery stores, he began
writing his goals on little slips of paper and putting them in his
wallet.
   ``Writing down the goal,'' he explained, ``tends to keep your
from straying too far.'' Over the years he never missed a goal,
extravagant as the goals might have seemed to someone who knew the
contents of his wallet.
   ``From 1938 to 1978 I grew a bit more than 30 percent a year
compounded,'' he related. ``I reached $1 billion in 1978, and then
I dropped the goal back to 15 percent a year.'' Big companies just
can't grow as fast as small ones.
   ``At 15 percent a year a company will double in about five
years. In 1982 I hit $2 billion. But in 1987 I barely made $4
billion _ made it by just $200 million.'' That is, revenues reached
$4.2 billion.
   Revenues of that amount would put Carlson Companies about 125th
on the Fortune 500 list of largest, publicly held companies. But
Carlson is private and so isn't listed, though it owns some of the
best-known corporate names in America.
   To attempt doubling a $1 million company in five years is
ambitious. And Carlson's operations already are 4,000 times that.
But, he said, ``I wanted to go for $8 billion.''
   Carlson was too good a teacher; over the 50 years his key
personnel absorbed his drive. ``The rest of the guys wanted to
better my record,'' he said. ``They set a goal of 17.5 percent
growth for five years, or $9 billion-plus in 1992.''
   Carlson reflected, may even have had second thoughts. ``I never
missed a goal and I don't want to miss one now,'' he said.
Gradually he is turning things over to his successor, son-in-law
Edwin C. ``Skip'' Gage. The challenge is his.
   Over the years, Carlson did it his way. ``I never had a
long-term vision,'' he said in answer to a question. ``I was just
concerned about the coming year.'' Those little reminders in his
wallet were changed, upgraded annually.
   All the time he remained an entrepreneur, a creator rather than
a corporate executive, discovering, inventing, devising and always
examining his own moves. Perhaps for this reason he remembers the
lessons learned and can teach them.
   For just about anybody starting out in the business world:
``Don't wait for something to happen. What would you really be
happy doing? Listen to your heart rather than going into something
that isn't right for you.''
   On raising money: ``If you're a young entrepreneur without money
don't go to the bank. Go to the guy you'll be getting your supplies
from. He'll want you to grow as a customer.''
   Behind that advice is a lesson learned: In 1938, Carlson sought
a $1,000 bank loan and was turned down. Now he has a $100 million
revolving credit line with the same bank. He might not forget, but
he forgives.
   On hours worked: ``We always work six days. I told all my people
that by working five days we stay with the rest of them. On the
sixth day we get ahead of them.
   ``We'd come in on Saturday, some in sports clothes. We'd talk,
exchange ideas. We'd eat lunch and maybe leave early, but these
were the most productive hours because we communicated.''
   As he grew, the stakes did, too. Growth meant ever-greater
risks. Internal growth wasn't always sufficient, and 30 percent of
today's revenues is from acquisitions.
   ``All bite size,'' he said. ``We don't try to buy something like
Texaco. I like to sleep at night. Just bite size, and I take good
personnel with me.''
   Did he ever doubt, or lose confidence?
   ``I don't remember it as a question of losing confidence, but I
remember running scared, when I knew the amount of money needed for
supplies and inventories could put me under,'' he answered.
   Do some of the dire economic forecasts today disturb him?
   ``The progress of my company has never coincided with the
economic forecasts,'' he said. ``You just cannot find a correlation
between my chart and the economic chart.
   ``Do forecasts worry me? Yes, but I need a little tension in the
company. The main thing on your mind should be moving goods and
satisfying customers.''

<HEAD>Japanese Beginning to Spend their Yen on Luxury Goods</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 13th graf ``People's sense ... department stores''

<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Japanese are breaking with a tradition of
frugality to bring some luxury into their lives _ big cars,
European furniture, diamond jewelry.
   The government has been urging them to spend the yen they
ordinarily put in the bank, in hopes of spurring the domestic
economy.
   Analysts say skyrocketing property values, easy credit, price
stability and the yen's rise in value are generating a fast-growing
market for luxury goods _ a turnaround from three years of slumping
consumption when the surging yen subdued the export-driven economy.
   ``Selling well are expensive and luxurious durable goods such as
large-size TV sets, refrigerators, furniture and dining ware
imported from Europe,'' said Mitsuhiro Hirose of the Sales
Promotion Division at Matsuya Co., a major department store on
Tokyo's bustling Ginza.
   A recent Bank of Japan report called brisk personal buying a
``key element'' of Japan's current economic success. The government
has cut income taxes and launched a 5-trillion-yen ($40 billion)
public spending program, spurring housing starts. The bank cut its
discount rate to a record low 2.5 percent, and the public Housing
Loan Corp. trimmed more than a percentage point off its interest
rate, currently 4.35 percent.
   Consumer demand as measured by department store sales jumped 8.2
percent in April from a year earlier, according to the Japan
Department Stores Association. Total sales by 254 major department
stores last year rose an average 4.7 percent every month, the
association said.
   And the gross national product, which measures total output of
goods and services, grew at an annualized rate of 11.3 percent in
the first quarter of this year, figures from the Economic Planning
Agency indicate.
   ``People regard expensive, new products as a means of being
somewhat different from others,'' said Takayuki Ikeda, manager of
the Consumer Electronics Product Division at Mitsubishi Electric Co.
   In 1985 the company began marketing its 37-inch color television
set, the industry equivalent of 35-inch American models, for
478,000 yen ($3,825).
   ``At first we never thought a large-sized TV with a built-in
picture tube would be accepted in Japanese homes, which some
Europeans have ridiculed as `rabbit hutches','' Ikeda said in an
interview, ``but the opposite is true. People have realized that
the larger the TV screen, the more fun they can have, the more
feeling of real ambience.''
   Japanese bought 9.6 million color TV sets last year, 20 percent
of which measured 22 inches or larger, up 12 percent from 1986,
according to industry figures.
   Automakers are benefiting from the Japanese who now want bigger,
more expensive cars. Toyota Motor Co. in April sold 14,673 of its
large-size, 4.6-million-yen ($37,000), top-of-the-line Crown models
_ a 92.5-percent jump from a year earlier.
   ``People's sense of money has become accentuated,'' said Isao
Takayama, chief of the jewelry division at the swank Mitsukoshi
department stores. ``Several years ago you could buy a house for 50
to 60 million yen. Now it costs up to 500 million yen ($4 million).
It tends to dull people's sense of money.''
   Reflecting a demand for expensive ornaments, imports of polished
diamonds rose 61.6 percent to 1.06 million carats in the first four
months of this year over last year, according to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
   Takayama said the hottest items are diamond rings priced at 2
million yen ($16,000).
   ``Nowadays customers come in asking to see diamonds of about 100
million yen ($228,000),'' he said. ``Four or five years ago, that
was the stuff of dreams.''

   Palestinians throw stones and sometimes
firebombs at Israelis in the uprising on the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Israeli soldiers sometimes strike back with live ammunition,
but more often with rubber bullets, tear gas, and clubbings. The
rubber bullets, which are not intended to kill, are taking a toll,
nevertheless, and Palestinian children have been caught by them in
the crossfire. Some have lost their eyes, leaving them in a state
of trauma and with little understanding of what happened to them.
At the same time, the stones and firebombs are leaving Israelis
seriously injured, some maimed for life. Following are two stories
by Associated Press correspondents on how the disorders have
tragically afflicted individuals on both sides of the conflict.

   Three-year-old Rasha
Hoshiyeh stabs out the eyes of her dolls and stuffed animals.
   She is trying to understand, her mother says, what happened when
a rubber bullet fired by an Israeli soldier put out her left eye.
   ``She's not the same Rasha,'' said the mother, Majdouleen
Hoshiyeh. ``At night she looks at herself in the mirror without her
eye and sometimes she starts to cry.''
   Rasha Hoshiyeh was playing at the door of her family's home in
the West Bank town of Ramallah in March when the rubber bullet,
fired by one of the soldiers chasing Palestinian protesters,
smashed through the glass and hit her in the left eye.
   ``The force of the bullet knocked Rasha over. The eyeball was
hanging outside the socket, there was blood flowing everywhere,''
Mrs. Hoshiyeh, 24, recalled in an interview.
   Rasha has since undergone two operations. Today, the dark-haired
child with curly pigtails and long black lashes wears an immobile
glass eye several shades darker than her chestnut-colored right eye.
   Since losing her eye, Rasha is more nervous, her mother said.
Evidence of that is a blond-haired doll and teddy bear that sit
eyeless on a shelf in her bedroom.
   Eye loss is among the most dramatic of the injuries suffered by
36,000 Palestinians hurt by gunfire, tear gas, beatings or rubber
bullets during the seven-month-old Palestinian uprising on the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Of the total, about 6,000 have suffered lasting injuries,
according to figures compiled from hospital and field reports by
the Arab-run Human Rights Information Center.
   One Palestinian, Yussef Abu Eid, 32, was killed in March by a
rubber bullet fired at point blank range into his right eye. Two
soldiers were charged with manslaughter.
   One of the youngest Palestinians to lose an eye is 9-month-old
Fidah Sharafi of the Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. On
June 6, troops chasing demonstrators fired rubber bullets into the
marketplace where, her mother said, they had gone to buy milk.
   ``When my daughter is old enough to understand,'' said Safia
Sharafi, 22. ``I will tell her: `The Jewish soldiers came here and
opened fire, and that's how you lost your eye.'''
   Another infant victim was Hoda Masoub.
   On June 1, Hoda's mother grabbed her daughter and ran into the
narrow alleyway after troops hurled a tear gas cannister into her
home while pursuing stone-throwing youths. Hoda was hit by seven
rubber bullets.
   ``My daughter is disfigured for life and she did nothing,'' said
Mrs. Masoub, 29, as her daughter sat sucking a lollipop, her face
half-concealed by a bandage and her right arm in a cast.
   Dr. Ziad Jaouni, an ophthalmologist at St. John's Eye Hospital
in Jerusalem, said 81 Palestinians had been treated at the facility
for eye injuries received in clashes with troops. Of that group, 42
lost their eyes _ about half of them innocent bystanders.
   ``We have treated many small children and elderly people who
were not demonstrating. They were hit while standing in windows,
doorways or on balconies,'' he said.
   Doctors say dozens of others with serious eye damage or loss
have been hospitalized elsewhere.
   Eye injuries have been caused primarily by the cork-shaped
rubber bullets, which are embedded with a hard metal core.
   An Israeli army spokesman, Col. Ranaan Gissin, said rubber
bullets do not have a straight trajectory and aiming is difficult
when soldiers are chasing rioters.
   ``We don't fire rubber bullets at children and their mothers,''
Gissin said. ``It is one of the non-lethal means we use to disperse
a mob and is not intended to cause bodily harm.''

   Dan Cohen, a 20-year-old soldier, was struck in
the head by a 65-pound block thrown from a rooftop while he
patroled the occupied West Bank city of Nablus in March.
   The injury left him paralyzed from the chest down and confined
to a wheelchair.
   ``I'm very angry,'' said Cohen, who is expected to remain in the
hospital here at least until September. ``If I found him (the
assailant), I would hang him from a high tree.''
   But Moshe Nussbaum, who was badly burned on the hands in a
firebomb attack while on reserve duty in the West Bank, said he had
no intention of seeking revenge.
   ``They weren't after Moshe Nussbaum. They were after Israeli
soldiers, and they found me. Those are the rules of this war. I can
understand it. I can't say I hate those kids.''
   Cohen and Nussbaum are among 428 Israeli soldiers injured since
the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. In addition, 272 Israeli civilians have been hurt.
   Army officials said they could not provide a breakdown of
injuries, but according to media reports most soldiers have been
injured by stones and a smaller number burned in firebomb attacks.
   During the same period, about 36,000 Palestinians were hurt by
army gunfire, tear gas, rubber bullets and beatings, according to
the Palestinian-run Human Rights Information Center. It estimated
6,000 suffered lasting injuries.
   Israelis involved in the confrontations with Palestinians say
homemade weapons used by Palestinian youths are far more lethal
than people realize.
   ``Firebombs are dangerous weapons,'' said Nussbaum, 35, a police
reporter for Israel radio when he wasn't on military reserve duty.
``I used to say on the radio, `Two people were hurt by a firebomb.'
Now I understand the real meaning of the word.''
   Nussbaum and two other soldiers were on patrol in the West Bank
village of Janiyeh on June 9 when a firebomb was hurled into their
open jeep.
   ``It exploded between my friend and me,'' Nussbaum said. ``I
started to burn, so I jumped out and rolled on the ground to
extinguish the flames.''
   Nussbaum was burned severely on his hands and back and was given
skin transplants. He has been unable to return to work because he
has not regained the full use of his hands.
   In retaliation for the attack, the army blew up two homes
belonging to three suspects and sealed the house of a fourth. The
army also has begun to issue fire-retardant overalls to soldiers.
   Cohen was on patrol in the narrow alleyways of Nablus' old city
when the block was dropped on his head March 19. The assailant has
not been found.
   ``We were afraid because we did not know from where they would
throw the next stone at us. ... It was like a war,'' Cohen said in
an interview.
   But he added that the Israelis were at a disadvantage despite
their superior weapons and firepower.
   ``The Arabs knew our orders on opening fire. They knew we
weren't allowed to shoot at stone-throwers and that as soldiers we
could not run away from the stones. So what was left was to be hit
by stones and shut up.''
   Cohen, who says he hopes to study commercial photography after
his release from the hospital, complained that injuries to soldiers
were largely ignored while the media focused on the Palestinians.
   ``When a soldier gets hurt nothing is written about it,'' he
said. ``I would like it to be known that not only the Arabs are
suffering.''

   On a corner in Harlem, amid the men selling
baseball caps, wind-up toys and perfume, Sharon Williams tries to
save a life or two by killing off a popular myth.
   She is a black woman trying to convince other blacks that the
face of AIDS isn't always white.
   ``I tell them, `What you don't know can kill you,''' said
Williams, who has spent 18 months passing out truth and condoms as
a city Health Department outreach worker. She believes information
means salvation, but on the street, denial runs deep.
   If people cared to hear statistics, they would learn the virus
doesn't discriminate:
   _ Blacks represent 12 percent of the population but account for
26 percent of all U.S. AIDS cases, a figure constant since the
government began tracking cases in 1981. Hispanics make up 7
percent of the population and 14 percent of the AIDS cases.
   _ Blacks make up 73 percent of all heterosexual transmission
cases, compared with 13 percent each for whites and Hispanics. The
risk of contracting AIDS is at least 15 times greater for black and
Hispanic heterosexuals than for white heterosexuals.
   _ More than half of all women with AIDS are black; 19 percent
are Hispanic.
   _ More than half the children with AIDS are black; 25 percent
are Hispanic.
   The numbers only hint at the worst part of the story: when
educators talk about AIDS in minority communities, they're talking
about the death of entire families.
   ``What you have now is grandparents who are burying their kids
who are burying their grandkids,'' said Ravinia Hayes-Cozier,
director of the Office for Community Development for the New York
City health department. ``There's a possibility for two generations
to be destroyed if we don't take it seriously.''
   ``This is going to wipe our community out,'' said Henri Norris,
director of the Multi-Cultural Alliance for the Prevention of AIDS
in San Francisco. ``In the 21st century, black Americans are going
to be in very short supply.''
   AIDS is the fatal insult to an already injured community, said
Hayes-Cozier, who likens the black community to an immune system
long ravaged by societal ills such as poverty, homelessness,
unemployment, drugs and crime.
   ``It's not by accident this same community should be the perfect
host for AIDS,'' she said.
   Ultimately, the spread of AIDS among minorities has nothing
specifically to do with race and everything to do with behavior.
Studies show that people of color engage more frequently than
whites in activities known to spread the fatal disease, such as
needle-sharing and casual sex among intravenous drug users. Of
cases contracted through intravenous drug use, 80 percent are black
or Hispanic.
   But as researchers and educators prepare for the second annual
Minority AIDS Conference, scheduled for Aug. 15-17 in Washington,
D.C., they say the message filtering down to minority communities,
particularly blacks, has been too confusing, too inaccurate or too
demeaning to evoke widespread concern and action.
   Instead, the most common response has been fear and denial, a
denial reinforced by AIDS media campaigns aimed at gay white men,
who make up the bulk of total AIDS cases.
   ``The message was, if you're not gay, you're not white, you're
not sleeping with anyone who's gay or white, you're not at risk for
the disease,'' said Ernest Andrews, an AIDS educator in the poor,
predominantly black Bayview-Hunter's Point area of San Francisco.
   ``The community became very comfortable with the idea it was not
at risk. We've had to fight that kind of denial, which really has
blanketed the black community.''
   In a recent survey of black adults in South Carolina, 95 percent
either did not know or did not believe that more than half the
children and women with AIDS in the United States are black.
One-fourth characterized AIDS as a gay disease.
   A 1987 Los Angeles Times survey of 2,100 people found anxiety
about AIDS highest among blacks, and an Illinois Department of
Public Health poll showed blacks and Hispanics to be among the
least knowledgeable and most fearful of AIDS.
   In big cities, educators must address the fear that AIDS is a
government conspiracy to eliminate society's ``undesirables,''
namely minorities, drug addicts and homosexuals. They must overcome
cultural and religious barriers that prevent people from halting
behavior that puts them at risk or from using condoms to protect
themselves from infection.
   And they must constantly seek funding in a struggle that pits
minority outreach efforts against better-organized gay groups with
significant resources and political clout.
   In San Francisco, a city that spends more per capita for AIDS
education, treatment and research than any other in the nation,
only $100,000 of the $20 million spent in 1985 and 1986 was
earmarked for minority communities. Last year, a coalition of
minority education groups bypassed the city and asked the state for
$150,000 to target high-risk behaviors in their communities.
   This year's $177 million federal AIDS information-education
budget, up from last year's $104 million, includes $7 million for
state and local minority activities, the same as 1987. An
additional $3 million was included for national minority efforts.
Federal treatment of perinatal AIDS, aimed largely at black and
Hispanic women in New York and New Jersey, receives about $6
million.
   ``They divide the two populations, gay vs. minorities,''
Hayes-Cozier said. ``It almost sets up the scenario that it's a
battle that can't be won.''

   In the trenches, they are disheartened but still fighting.
Williams and 14 other outreach workers must cover a dozen
neighborhoods with the highest HIV infection rate in New York,
which has 15,000 AIDS cases, more than any other U.S. city. The
statistics, and the job, can be overwhelming.
   ``Sometimes you get really, really busy, and it gets depressing.
You can feel helpless,'' said Williams, 26. ``How can one person
ideally educate 300,000 people? Across five zip codes? It's
impossible.''
   She does what she can, and she walks away from presentations at
places like the Harlem men's shelter knowing she has told them what
they need to know to avoid the virus. She also knows that AIDS is
like a festering wound: open it, and a hundred other poisons bubble
to the surface.
   ``The biggest problem we have is that there are so many other
problems,'' she said. ``How can you teach someone about AIDS when
they can't pay their rent, they're facing eviction, their husband
abuses them, they're homeless?''
   ``You can't worry about something five years down the line when
you're worried about feeding yourself today,'' said Sunny Rumsey,
who coordinates AIDS outreach for the New York City health
department. ``These communities are just overstressed. I think AIDS
is the straw that's breaking the camel's back.''
   A man in Alabama told Venus Medina, an associate for minority
affairs at the National AIDS Network, that he couldn't discuss AIDS
education with her. ``I have no food in my refrigerator. I have no
food stamps, no work. How can I talk about AIDS when I have nothing
to eat?'' he said.
   ``Some of these people say, `I should get AIDS and get out of
this awful world,''' Medina said. ``They say, `Don't talk to me
about what's going to happen next week or next month; talk to me
about how to keep my stomach full and keep a roof over my head.'
How do we talk about AIDS to a person who's already given up?''
   ``We talk their language. We put it in terms they can
understand,'' San Francisco's Andrews said. ``We also address the
fears they might have.''
   One of the most pervasive is the conspiracy theory, the belief
that AIDS is a plot by authorities _ the U.S. government in the
most popular version, the Soviets in another _ to wipe out
minorities. The concept of genocide ranges from benign neglect to
an outright campaign of annihilation, and there is enough evidence
of the former to give credence to the latter, educators say.
   ``Does the government really want to save its citizens? The
minority community will tell you `No,''' Rumsey said. ``(The
community will say) `They want us to get infected. They want us not
to know what's going on.'''
   Blacks have been disproportionately affected since the beginning
of the epidemic, but minority educators note that while the
government initially listed Haitians as a risk group, it failed to
warn blacks in general.
   ``Why weren't TV messages made to say that black people are
being affected?'' said the Rev. Carl Bean, founder of the Los
Angeles Minority AIDS Project. ``Everytime they saw anything on the
news, it was always a white gay male. It gave people an opportunity
to say, `That's not me.'''
   Outreach workers say their job has been made more difficult
because the epidemic was well along before they were alerted. Bean
started the Los Angeles Project in his home in late 1984 after
hearing the statistics in an AIDS support training program.
   ``It just blew me away,'' he said. ``I couldn't understand why I
was sitting in training class with only three people of color out
of 50. I thought, `I must go back home to my people.'''
   At the time, there were no culturally sensitive brochures or
posters. ``In my community, there was nothing that put a face on it
that said `black,''' Bean said. He created his own, in simple
language and the red, black and green of the black liberation
movement.
   Lack of money elsewhere has meant that little effective
literature has been produced. Outreach worker Williams carries a
bagful of brochures that she knows many people won't bother to
read. In South Carolina, the founder of the state's AIDS Education
Network uses tips from her beautician's job to buy AIDS information
materials and develop her own.
   Getting the message out is one challenge; getting people to
listen is another. Techniques used in the middle-class white gay
community don't work in poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods, with
their basic distrust of governmental agencies.
   In San Francisco, Andrews mounted a production of an original
play, ``Community At Risk.'' Reformed drug addicts-turned-educators
in San Francisco, Chicago, New York and Atlanta go into shooting
galleries, where addicts inject drugs, to talk one-on-one about the
dangers of sharing needles.
   Frustration over reaching so few people breeds creative
solutions: AIDS rap contests, free ``Blow the Whistle on AIDS''
concerts, raffles and AIDS information parties paid for by outreach
groups. Meanwhile, the country still lacks a national media
campaign that shows the many faces of AIDS in a hard-hitting,
non-judgmental way.
   ``The community needs to see and hear real live people saying,
`I've got AIDS, my baby's got AIDS, my mother has AIDS.' That has
not happened,'' Andrews said. ``And until that happens, it's going
to be like chipping away at granite with a small chisel.''

   Someday soon, Dr. Mireille Tribie, a family
practitioner, hopes to enlist the help of a voodoo priest.
   She thinks he may help convince Haitian women infected with AIDS
that the virus might ultimately kill any children they bear.
   ``They don't believe what I tell them,'' said Tribie, director
of the minority AIDS program for the Haitian-American Community
Association of Dade County.
   ``They think the disease is mystical, something evil, that
someone put a voodoo hex on them. (They think) it's impossible for
them to be sick because they don't feel sick.''
   In Miami's Little Haiti, where some of the city's 80,000
Haitians seek out voodoo priests for spiritual advice, mysticism
and medicine clash with deadly results.
   And in minority communities across the nation, religious and
cultural practices from disapproval of condoms to bisexuality
frustrate health officials desperately trying to change risky
behavior.
   ``There are some tremendous cultural barriers I don't think
we'll ever be able to surpass,'' said Jeanne Easton, director of
the Dade County AIDS Program Office in Miami. ``What's more
entrenched in a culture than sexuality?''
   Tribie has contacted an anthropologist to seek a meeting with
the area's chief voodoo priest, hoping he can preach to
AIDS-infected women on the dangers of getting pregnant. Childbirth
is so important in Haitian and other cultures that the 50-50 chance
of delivering a healthy child is considered worth the risk.
   Haitians were originally identified as a high-risk group for
AIDS until it was shown their behavior, not their nationality, made
them susceptible. In Florida, which has the third-highest number of
AIDS cases behind New York and California, 33 percent of blacks
with AIDS were born in Haiti.
   Many minorities have yet to learn that what they do, rather than
race, puts them at risk for the disease. Much of the complacency
and denial stems from the fact AIDS was first identified in white
homosexuals.
   Hispanic men who have anal sex with males, however, don't regard
themselves as homosexuals and therefore may not recognize the risks
_ to their wives as well as themselves.
   ``It starts off in Third World poverty. Men have sex with other
men for money,'' said Dr. Laureano Vega, director of the South
Florida AIDS Project. ``They did not consider themselves gay
because it was not something they did for pleasure. They're into
heavy denial.
   ``If they are the penetrator, they're not the ones receiving
infected semen,'' he said. ``They tend to think there's a lower
risk for contracting the disease. That's not the case.''
   AIDS brochures are being translated into Spanish, but there are
subtle dialect differences among Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans
and South Americans. Some sexual acts have no translation in
Spanish, such as fisting, a variation of anal intercourse. That
weakens the warning.
   In addition, ``everything has to be less explicit,'' Vega said.
``You have to sterilize the message. We cannot approach these
issues as openly as we can in the Anglo community.''
   Religious conservatism in the black community and its associated
homophobia have forced many gay black men to hide their sexual
identity, making it difficult to reach them, educators say.
   ``There is a percentage that identify as black first, gay
second,'' said San Francisco AIDS educator Ernest Andrews. ``They
don't go to gay bars and they don't read gay newspapers. Their
sexuality is very private.''
   Religious beliefs have proved a profound obstacle to AIDS
education in very basic ways. With the Roman Catholic Church
opposing condom use, it is difficult to persuade Hispanics to use
them.
   ``We're asking them to almost walk away from their culture,''
said Sunny Rumsey, AIDS educator for the New York City Health
Department. ``How do they stay religious and still protect
themselves from the virus?''
   The church's position has made that impossible, minority social
workers say.
   ``We have to cut out this moral judgment. It's not a moral
issue. It's not a religious issue. It's a health issue,'' said Ruth
Rodriquez of the Hispanic AIDS Forum in New York. ``The shame of it
is, people are infected and die in the meantime.''
   Even when religion is not a factor, economics may be. Cutting
off sexual activity, for instance, might mean cutting off a source
of income.
   ``For poor women, sex may function as a source of employment, a
method for establishing ownership or proprietary rights in a
relationship, or a means of acquiring much needed tangible
support,'' Dr. Vickie Mays, a UCLA psychology professor, said in a
presentation at the American Psychological Association in New York
last year.
   ``When people are perpetually poor, they're not going to spend a
dollar for a condom when they can buy food,'' said Dr. Emo Akpaeti
of Miami.
   In addition, many men refuse to use condoms, and minority women
have little power to persuade them.
   ``We ask them to `negotiate' safer sex ... when many of them
don't know what the word `negotiate' means,'' Mays said. ``Despite
risk-reduction advice to `talk to their prospective partners,' a
rather middle-class notion, many women don't bother to ask men
about previous sexual or drug use behaviors because they know the
men will lie or discount the risk.''
   To complicate matters, in the Haitian community, some women
believe condoms damage their bodies.
   ``They feel the vagina is a sacred part. You have sex and babies
with it. Nothing else can go in there, like a condom, because it
would spoil her sexual organs,'' Tribie said.
   Childbearing is such a strong cultural imperative that even
knowing they are HIV-positive doesn't stop minority women from
getting pregnant.
   ``These people don't equate the virus or infection with having
sex or having a baby,'' Easton said of the Haitian community.
``They're used to having their children die. It's no big deal. It's
an extension of the poverty they came from.''
   In poor communities where the infant mortality rate already is
staggering, the 50-50 chance of producing an infected child often
seems acceptable odds, particularly to women who know childbearing
will bolster their relationship or enhance their community standing.
   ``It's a very basic instinct,'' said New York's Rodriquez.
``There's something very lifegiving about your worth and having
been alive at all in leaving a child. Some people say, `I believe
in God, and God would not do this do me or my baby.'''

   Another hot afternoon at the beauty
parlor. DiAna DiAna rolls Emma Jacobs' hair into tight curls,
applies her own brand of oil conditioner and talks about men and
women, sex and death.
   No idle gossip here. At DiAna's Hair Ego, Emma Jacobs gets the
full treatment: a perm and an education.
   For 18 months, DiAna has been telling her corner of the world
about a disease that seems too remote to be real. Only 300 cases of
AIDS have been reported in South Carolina's largely rural
population of 4 million. An additional 1,600 people are
HIV-positive. About 65 new cases are reported each month. More than
half the cases so far are among blacks.
   DiAna and partner Bambi Sumpter, who met at a state health
department AIDS training program and formed the South Carolina AIDS
Education Network, understand that information has to spread faster
than the disease to change the future.
   So they teach, anyone, anywhere, anyway they can. They do it on
their own time, mostly with their own money. So far 4,000 people
have gotten the message, among them children, parents, beauticians,
lawyers, prison officials. And of course, the ladies and gentlemen
who come to DiAna's Hair Ego.
   ``People been coming in here six, eight years, and I never know
much more than that their kid's gone from first grade to high
school,'' said DiAna, who has spent 25 of her 40 years making other
people beautiful. ``And then they come in and all of a sudden
because of this AIDS stuff, they have these very, very personal
conversations that are unbelievable.''
   They have had graphic discussions about sexual preferences, what
to do about sexually active pre-teens and how to get men to use
condoms.
   ``You can talk to your beautician, you know, about things you
wouldn't normally say to other people,'' Jacobs said. ``It's a
little like talking to a therapist.''
   It began when DiAna decided she needed to know about AIDS. Were
any beauty services risky? What precautions should she take? The
more she learned, the more convinced she was that everyone needed
to know what she knew, the sooner the better.
   Now a dose of reality awaits everyone who comes through the
door. Women under hairdryers watch AIDS education tapes. A table
holds neat stacks of AIDS pamphlets, donated or purchased with
customers' tips. The centerpiece is a glass bowl filled with
gift-wrapped condoms. Ladies once too embarrassed to pick one up
now take handfuls for themselves and their teen-agers.
   AIDS posters hang on the walls amid blow-ups of impeccably
coifed models _ ``Last to Know, Maybe First to Go'' reads one
hand-lettered sign _ and next to DiAna's mirror is a copy of her
most recent AIDS column from a weekly black newspaper, featuring
real questions and no-nonsense answers.
   ``Why do y'all make it sound like a black problem _ don't more
white folks have AIDS than blacks?''
   ``Can you get AIDS if you sit where an AIDS kid sat?''
   ``If this AIDS problem is so bad, why doesn't somebody do
something?''
   Somebody is. DiAna and partner Sumpter, a doctoral candidate in
public health education, have created educational materials for
illiterate people and a program that trains children to teach their
peers about AIDS. DiAna's new support group, ``Mothers Against
AIDS,'' helps parents communicate with youngsters, using the
language they use.
   ``The children are especially important,'' DiAna said, ``because

   Growth in personal income slowed in all but
three states during the first three months of 1988, barely keeping
ahead of inflation, the government said.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that growth in income
in the 50 states and the District of Columbia slowed to 0.8 percent
in the January-March period, compared with growth of 2.8 percent in
the final quarter of 1987.
   Despite the slowdown, incomes managed to stay slightly ahead of
the increase in prices, which was 0.6 percent in the first quarter
for personal consumption spending.

<HEAD>Personal Income Growth Slips In First Quarter; Oil Futures Recover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's latest reading of American purchasing power
shows personal income barely stayed ahead of inflation during the
first quarter of 1988.
   The Commerce Department report released Wednesday indicated
income growth in the 50 states and the District of Columbia slowed
to 0.8 percent in the January-March period, compared with growth of
2.8 percent in the final quarter of 1987.
   Incomes managed to stay slightly ahead of the increase in
prices, which was 0.6 percent in the first quarter for personal
consumption spending.
   Income in the 12 months ended March 31 expanded by 6.3 percent,
while inflation was 3.8 percent.
   Analysts attributed part of the first quarter slowdown to swings
in farm subsidy payments. Slower job growth and a drop in
investment income were also factors, the report said.
   In the financial markets on Wednesday, oil prices rebounded amid
upbeat reports about the proposed cease-fire in the Persian Gulf
and the possibility for a meeting of key OPEC members.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, which expired
Wednesday, settled 43 cents higher at $15.66 per barrel.
   The market's move came following reports that the United Nations
would send a negotiating team to Iran and Iraq to nail down the
details of the cease-fire. Also Wednesday, rumors circulated in the
market that the price monitoring committee of the Organziation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries would meet early next month to
discuss way to rein in production and stabilize oil prices.
   The stock market, meanwhile, posted gains in a session dominated
by activity in a handful of takeover stocks. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials climbed 13.34 to close at 2,110.60.
   Elsewhere, soybean futures closed sharply lower for the third
consecutive day on the Chicago Board of Trade as showers continued
to relieve drought conditions in the Farm Belt.

   Oil prices have rebounded in response to reports
that the chances were improving for peace in the Persian Gulf and
unity among OPEC producers.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate settled up 43
cents at $15.66 per barrel on Wednesday, its expiration day.
   The contract had soared 84 cents on Monday and lost 47 cents
Tuesday as the market tried to sort out conflicting assessments of
Iran's reported agreement to an immediate cease-fire in its
8-year-old war with Iraq.
   The market moved up strongly Wednesday in response to reports
that the United Nations would send a negotiating team to Iran and
Iraq to nail down the details of the cease-fire.
   Traders said the latest news appeared to bolster chances for
peace in the war-torn region, which in turn could lead to better
cooperation among oil producers, who have been flooding world
markets with oil to fund the war effort.
   Also Wednesday, rumors circulated in the market that the price
monitoring committee of the Organziation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would meet early next month to discuss way to rein in
production and stabilize oil prices.
   Heating oil made an even stronger upward move than crude oil.
Bob Baker of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said the latest
inventory reports showed supplies were not increasing as much as
expected. He said the recent heat wave may have put a drain on
supplies as utilities turned to oil to meet peak power demands and
shippers resorted to moving goods by truck as an alternative to
river barges.
   The contract for August delivery of No.2 heating oil gained 1.75
cents to 44.65 cents a gallon on the New York Merc. The contract
for August delivery of unleaded gasoline rose .20 cent to 50.85
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Gruntal Stockbroker Charged With Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal indictment accuses a Gruntal & Co.
stockbroker of making about $250,000 in illegal stock trading
profits by using insider information about the acquisition by Great
Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. of the Waldbaum supermarket chain.
   The 31-count federal indictment handed down Wednesday accused
Robert Chestman, 41, of Lawrence, N.Y., of using confidential
information about the impending merger from a client distantly
related to Waldbaum Inc.'s founder.
   Charges against Chestman, a senior vice president, include mail
and securities fraud counts, and one count of perjury for allegedly
lying under oath to the Securities and Exchange Commission that he
did not receive inside information about Waldbaum.
   Keith Loeb, who is married to the niece of Ira Waldbaum, settled
an SEC civil suit last October by agreeing to pay $45,307 in fines
and alleged illegal profits stemming from the acquisition.
   Wednesday's indictment did not name either Loeb or Gruntal.
   Gruntal officials said they had no immediate comment on the
charges, although a spokesman said Chestman would continue to be
employed by the firm, a unit of the insurance holding company Home
Group Inc., during the proceedings.
   Chestman's attorney, Otto Obermaier, told the New York Times
that his client would fight the allegations.
   ``Mr. Chestman vigorously denies that charges that have been
made,'' Obermaier said. ``We are distressed that this matter has
escalated to the point of filing criminal charges.''
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said that in late Novermber
1986 Chestman bought 11,000 shares of Waldbaum stock for himself
and nine clients, including members of the Waldbaum family, after
learning from Loeb that the company was about to be sold to A&P at
$50 a share. Chestman kept 3,000 shares for himself, he said.
   Waldbaum stock had been trading over the counter for between
$23.50 and $24.75 a share, but after the merger was announced
publicly about a week later it jumped to around $49 a share,
Giuliani said.
   ``The SEC noted suspicious trading in the stock and commenced an
investigation,'' Giuliani told a news conference. He said his
office and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service later were called
into the investigation.
   Giuliani said the case was especially significant because the
alleged illegal trading occurred less than two weeks after the case
of former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky was made public. The two
cases were not connected, he said.
   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million to settle
insider-trading charges and was sentenced last December to three
years imprisonment on a single felony count of conspiring to lie to
the SEC. Boesky's cooperation with federal investigators has since
led to several other indictments.
   In addition to the perjury count, the grand jury indictment of
Chestman includes 20 counts of securities fraud and 10 counts of
mail fraud.
   Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a fine of up to twice the total gain from the
transactions.
   Chestman is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges July 28.

   The dollar was mixed in earlier European trading
today. Gold prices fell and the London silver market was busy.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar was supported by
underlying bullish sentiment, but capped by the fear of central
bank intervention. They predicted the currency would remain locked
in a narrow range for the immediate future.
   ``There's good two-way trading, but the market is very
nervous,'' said one senior trader with a large Italian bank in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar built upon overnight gains in New York, rising 0.45 yen
to a closing 133.50. Later, in London, it was quoted at 133.27 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.8607 West German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.5350
Swiss francs, down from 1.5360; 6.2420 French francs, down from
6.2455; 2.0919 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0910; 1,372.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,371.50; and 1.1960 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1959.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7190, more expensive for
buyers than late Wednesday's $1.7085.
   Gold eased in quiet London trading. At midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$443.20 a troy ounce, down from late Wednesday's $444.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $443.60, down from $445 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.42 to close at a bid $444.43.
   Silver dropped as low as $7.63 a troy ounce on profit-taking
this morning, then climbed back on speculative buying from
Switzerland and the Middle East, bullion dealers said.
   The metal was quoted at midday at a bid $7.73, little changed
from late Wednesday's $7.75.
   Dealers said the continuing silver miners' strike in Peru is
still influencing trading, but that information about the strike is
sketchy, contributing to silver's volatility.
   One dealer said the market is full of contradictory reports
about when and if the strike will end, as well as about how much of
the country's silver output is affected.

   Prices fluctuated wildly today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange in heavy but cautious trading, while the dollar gained
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 404.95-point
winner Wednesday, added 122.16 points, or 0.44 percent, to close at
27,676.14.
   The Nikkei, the exchange's most widely followed barometer,
opened slightly above its close Wednesday. It dipped in early
morning trade from heavy profit-taking by investors taking
advantage of the previous day's sharp leap.
   The index fell 228 points in the late morning to 27,416.24, but
gradually recovered the rest of the day. Today's volume on the
first section of the exchange was 1.5 billion shares.
   ``The bottom flow of the market was bullish all day,'' said a
broker at a major securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``It was able to absorb heavy profit-taking and ended
with a plus.''
   He said investors appeared uncertain about where to put their
money in the market after two consecutive days of extremely
volatile trading.
   Steel shares were higher today. On Wednesday, most of steel
shares plunged, with Nippon Steel a 60-point loser and Nippon Kokan
a 55-point loser.
   In contrast, electronics and automobile shares, which had been
seen as replacing steel stocks as the market leaders, failed to
make expected gains because of heavy profit-taking.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 133.50 yen in Tokyo, up 0.45 yen
from Wednesday's finish.
   The dollar, which gained 0.65 yen in New York overnight, opened
at 133.65 yen, up 0.60 yen from Wednesday's close. It traded in a
narrow range of 133.50-134.00 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened near the New York
closing level of 133.85 yen, and seemed likely to remain in that
range.
   ``Insurance companies and trading houses snapped up and bought
the dollar everytime it retreated to the lower 133's, and that kept
the dollar high all day,'' said an exchange dealer for a major
investment bank in Tokyo, also speaking on condition of ananymity.

<HEAD>Roy Disney Firm Makes $2.64 Billion Bid for Instant-Film Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. hinted it would reject a
proposed friendly takeover by Roy E. Disney _ nephew of the late
Walt Disney _ who announced a bid that values the instant-film
company at $2.84 billion.
   Disney, an investor with an estimated personal wealth of $560
million, announced the offer Wednesday and disclosed he already
owns 6.9 percent of Cambridge, Mass.,-based Polaroid through his
family's Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   Polaroid said it was reviewing the $40-a-share cash offer with
the help of outside advisers, but suggested management would look
unfavorably on a buyout.
   Referring to a retrenchment plan involving layoffs and
cost-cutting that was announced last week, Polaroid said in a news
release: ``We firmly believe that this is, without doubt, the right
course for Polaroid and for all of its shareholders, employees,
customers and communities.''
   Polaroid's stock shot up $6 to $40 a share Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Polaroid's retrenchment plan, announced July 12, was widely seen
as an anti-takeover measure, and analysts said Wednesday the timing
of the Shamrock offer suggested it was the trigger for the Polaroid
changes.
   ``It would be very hard to say they're unassociated,'' William
Relyea, who follows Polaroid for Eberstadt Fleming Inc. in New
York, said of the offer and the changes announced at Polaroid.
   Polaroid said it would cut up to 8 percent of its U.S. workforce
and save $50 million a year by reducing overhead and research and
development costs. The company also announced it would repurchase
$300 million of its own shares and create an employee stock
ownership program that owns 14 percent of the company's stock.
   Polaroid also said it would enter the $7 billion-a-year world
market for conventional film, challenging Eastman Kodak Co. and
Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   Disney described Polaroid's planned foray into the conventional
film business as a misguided attempt to regain momentum in the face
of a stagnating market for instant cameras and film.
   ``The announcement of the company's entry into the conventional
consumer film business appears to be a pedestrian attempt to give
the company new direction,'' Stanley P. Gold, Shamrock president
and chief executive officer, said in a news release.
   ``It betrays Polaroid's heritage of invention and creativity in
the development of new products and markets,'' he said.
   Gold also denounced Polaroid's stock repurchase and employee
stock ownership plans as a ``management entrenchment scheme.''
   In a letter delivered Wednesday to I. MacAllister Booth,
Polaroid president and chief executive officer, Shamrock proposed
that Polaroid management cooperate with the takeover offer.
   Including a recent issue of 10 million shares that created the
employee stock ownership program, Polaroid has 71 million shares
outstanding. The $40-a-share offer thus places a value of $2.84
billion on the company.
   Shamrock already holds 4.93 million shares, or 6.9 percent. To
buy the rest at $40 a share would cost Shamrock $2.64 billion.
   Shamrock offered as an alternative, if approved by the Polaroid
board, to pay a smaller amount of cash and agree to share the
after-tax proceeds of any money Polaroid might win in the damage
trial of its $5.7 billion patent infringement suit against Kodak.
   Kodak and Polaroid are scheduled to appear in U.S. District
Court in Boston on Jan. 9 to begin the damage award trial in the
suit, in which Polaroid claims Kodak violated Polaroid patents on
instant film and cameras from 1976 to 1986. Kodak calls the claim
unreasonably inflated.
   Disney is the son of the late Roy O. Disney, brother of
Disneyland creator Walt and the organizer of the business side of
the Disney empire. Forbes magazine last year listed Disney as being
worth $560 million.
   Shamrock, an investment vehicle for Disney's family, has
holdings in Walt Disney Co., as well as three television and 14
radio stations, 22 percent of Enterra, an energy services company,
real estate and a diverse investment portfolio. Shamrock's most
recent acquisition was Music Plus, a 56-outlet Los Angeles record
store chain.
   In announcing its revitalization plan July 12, Polaroid said it
planned to lay off between 500 and 800 workers in a cost-cutting
move. The Polaroid workforce has dropped from about 20,000 to
13,000 since 1978.
   In announcing the buyout offer, Shamrock also said it had filed
suit in Delaware Chancery Court challenging the employee stock
ownership plan as being overly dependent on borrowing and seeking
damages over cancellation of a meeting between Disney and Booth.
   Shamrock said it had filed suit in federal court in
Massachusetts seeking to overturn the state's anti-takeover law.

   Some food-industry analysts said Wednesday they expected Kelly
to launch a new effort to build a conglomerate, using one or more
of Beatrice's businesses as a vehicle for acquisitions.
   ``Kelly needs a vehicle to do what he does best and I think
he'll be looking for that vehicle,'' said Ronald Morrow, an analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Kelly, 66, employed such a strategy as chairman of E-II Holdings
Inc., an acquisition vehicle he built from some Beatrice units
after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. took Beatrice private in 1986
and installed him as chairman.
   E-II was bought by American Brands Inc. for $2.7 billion earlier
this year after E-II made a bid to acquire that company.
   Morrow said Kelly could create a suitable acquisition vehicle by
buying or spinning off as an independent company one or more of
Beatrice's profitable subsidiaries, which consist of Hunt-Wesson
Inc., Swift-Ekrich Inc. and Beatrice Cheese Inc.
   Beatrice, once a $13 billion conglomerate, has sold all of its
other assets since going private. It had hoped to find a single
buyer for the remainder of the company.
   But following the termination of talks with the unidentified
potential buyer, ``Beatrice has no current plans to engage in
further discussions relating to the acquisition of Beatrice by a
third party or the disposition of its major operating companies,''
the company said in the SEC filing.
   Analysts said industry rumors held that Beatrice had been
negotiating a buyout with Netherlands-based foods giant Unilever
NV, but Beatrice spokesman Charles Long would not comment on that.
   Long said Kelly might announce plans for himself and Beatrice in
September.
   Despite the intense speculation that has followed Kelly since
the E-II buyout, Roger Spencer, a Chicago-based analyst with
PaineWebber Inc., said he doubted Beatrice's announcement masked
secret designs.
   ``I think they evidently weren't able to attract a price in line
with their valuation for the property and the owners have decided
to run it as an operating company,'' Spencer said.

   Allied-Signal Inc. reported a 16
percent decline in its second-quarter earnings over a year ago when
it took a one-time gain on the sale of discontinued operations.
   The company said Wednesday that net income for the three months
ended June 30 fell to $128 million, or 85 cents a share, from $148
milion, or 85 cents a share, in 1987.
   Sales rose to $3.12 billion from $2.84 billion.
   Without the $37 million sale of several operations in 1987 _
among them, Linotype Group and Ampex Corp. _ Allied-Signal would
have realized a jump in profits from last year. The company said
earnings from continuing operations in the 1987 second quarter were
$111 million, or 64 cents a share.
   For the first six months of the year, Allied-Signal said net
income on continuing operations totaled $240 million, or $1.60 a
share, compared with earnings of $213 million, or $1.22 a share, in
1987. Sales rose 11 percent, to $6.1 billion from $5.5 billion.
   Chairman Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said the best performers during
the second quarter included Allied-Signal's engineered materials
business and its interest in Union Texas Petroleum.
   Earnings from its automotive and aerospace units declined during
the period, he said.
   Still, Hennessey said in a statement, ``We expect our overall
operating results to remain good for the remainder of the year, and
we anticipate substantial one-time gains in 1988 from our pending
transactions with Siemens AG in automotive electronics and with
Union Carbide in catalysts.''

<HEAD>Corporate Raider Agrees To Sell Calmat Shares to Japanese Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate raider Ronald A. Brierley has ended
his hostile takeover attempt for Calmat Co. and agreed to sell his
19 percent stake in the company to Japan's largest cement maker,
company officials said.
   Brierley, of New Zealand, will sell his stake for $41.75 a
share, or $242 million, a company official said Wednesday.
   ``Overall, we were disappointed in the outcome,'' said Robert G.
Sutherland, executive vice president of Brierley's La Jolla-based
investment arm, Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd. ``We are opposed
to the breakup (of Calmat), but we're unable to persuade the board
to talk to us.''
   Brierley had announced March 23 that Industrial Equity would
seek to buy all of Calmat's outstanding stock for $40 a share, but
never made an outright offer.
   Under terms of the sale announced Wednesday, Onoda will name two
directors to Calmat's 15-member board and will receive an option
from Calmat to buy in two years its California Portland Cement Co.
and 13 ready-mix concrete plants in the Los Angeles area.
   Onoda will become the state's biggest cement producer if, as
expected, the firm exercises its option to buy California Portland
Cement.
   The deal probably will also increase foreign control over the
U.S. cement industry, which already is 55 percent foreign owned,
said Max D. Moore of the Portland Cement Association, a Skokie,
Ill.-based industry trade group.
   Onoda's option will allow it to swap the 6 million shares it is
acquiring in Calmat for California Portland Cement and debt worth
$310 million. Or Calmat can insist on buying back the shares for
$271 million, in which case Onoda will be offered California
Portland Cement for $360 million in cash.
   Calmat stock dropped $3.50 to finish at $34 on heavy New York
Stock Exchange trading Wednesday. The company had traded as high as
$46.125 a share as short-term investors bought the stock in hopes
that Brierley's interest would prompt a bidding war.
   Calmat earned $78 million on sales of $602 million last year.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has
announced a virtual hiring freeze in all divisions and will begin
reassigning employees to marketing and sales jobs to strengthen
itself against computer and long-distance competitors.
   Chairman Robert Allen announced the indefinite freeze in a
televised message broadcast to employees nationwide from New York
Wednesday. Allen said administrative costs were rising too rapidly
and he wanted to place the company's emphasis on increasing sales.
   Allen said the freeze and redeployment of staff would help
``bring our employees closer to customers and the marketplace.''
   ``We're moving people from field tents to the front line,''
Burke Stinson, a spokesman, said today.
   Stinson said the company was transferring 3,000 people to the
sales and marketing force, a process that began at two divisions in
April and is now expanding companywide.
   AT&T continues to lose money in the computer business and has
been increasingly hard-pressed by competitors in long-distance
telelphone service, its bread-and-butter business.
   On Wednesday the company announced its profit slipped 0.3
percent in the second quarter as revenue rose 4.3 percent.
   The company is recruiting volunteers for the sales jobs from
among its 95,000 entry-level and second-level managers, although
all managers are eligible, Stinson said.
   The only hiring to continue will be college recruiting and
``strategic hiring of people who can help our marketing,'' he said.
   AT&T has about 315,000 employees, a total that has shrunk
steadily through layoffs and other steps since the 1984 breakup of
the Bell System.

<TEXT>
   ITT Corp.'s second-quarter profit fell 12
percent from the level of a year earlier, when results were boosted
by a one-time $28 million gain from the sale of Virgin Islands
Telephone Co., the company said Thursday.
   Earnings were helped by stronger results at the Hartford
insurance company; Sheraton hotels' European and Latin American
operations; defense technology; industrial and forest products; and
the 37 percent owned Alcatel NV, a European-based
telecommunications company, ITT said.
   ITT said it earned $228 million, or $1.59 per common share or
common equivalent, down from a restated $259 million, or $1.70 per
common share or common equivalent, in the same quarter of 1987.
   Net income for the 1988 quarter included $11 million in tax
benefits at the Hartford, down from $23 million in benefits a year
earlier. Excluding the phone company sale and the tax benefits,
earnings per share would have risen 10 percent.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 7 percent to $5.3 billion from $4.9
billion a year earlier. The totals include insurance and finance
revenues of $2.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion.
   Through repurchases, the company reduced its number of common
equivalent shares by about 6 percent in comparison to a year
earlier. Common equivalents include preferred shares and debentures
that are convertible into common stock.
   For the first half of 1988, net income totaled $407 million, or
$2.84 a share, up from $352 million, or $2.30 per share. Revenue
rose 9 percent to $10.3 billion from $9.5 billion. Revenue from
insurance and finance rose to $5.8 billion from $5.4 billion.

   PPG Industries Inc. said Thursday surging

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade following forecasts for a
return to hot, dry weather in the Midwest.
   The storm system that brought badly needed rain to the
drought-stricken region over the past several days has moved east.
The weather was expected to remain mild and dry into the weekend,
and the National Weather Service's latest 6-to-10-day forecast
predicts a return to warmer- and drier-than-normal conditions by
the middle of next week.
   Corn and wheat futures posted solid gains in early trading. Oats
and soybeans were mixed but mostly higher after a sharp, three-day
decline triggered by the rain.
   ``They're kind of raising their heads a little bit off the floor
after being pounded into the basement,'' said Jerry Gidel, grain
analyst with G.H. Miller & Co. in Chicago.
   But Gidel said he expected the markets to trade cautiously today.
   ``Maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel or maybe there's
another train,'' he said. ``Who knows?''
   In early trading, wheat was 5\ cents to 6 cents higher with
September at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 7 cents higher
with September at $3.18{ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 5
cents higher with September at $2.78{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{
cents lower to 21 cents higher with August at $8.55 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while most pork futures were sharply
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .50 cent to .87 cent higher with August at
65.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 75.50 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower
to 1.15 cents higher with August at 44.05 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.58 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with July
at 37.75 cents a pound.
   Most livestock and meat futures settled lower on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Schlumberger Reports Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Schlumberger Ltd., a New York-based oil services concern, on
Thursday reported its second-quarter earnings increased nearly
five-fold, due in part to firmer prices for the company's services,
market gains and the sale of a business unit.
   Net income for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $144 million,
or 53 cents a share, up from $30.2 million, or 11 cents a share in
the year-ago period. Revenue rose 22 percent to $1.35 billion from
$1.11 billion in the second quarter of 1987.
   The figures include a $35 million gain from the sale of the
company's electricity control and transformers division.
   Schlumberger Chairman Euan Baird said in a statement the
company's worldwide oilfield services operations grew 20 percent,
boosted by firmer prices and market gains.
   He said that so far the price of oil and gas has ``had little
effect on oil company activity,'' but cautioned that if ``present
price levels continue to erode, the strength of the normal second
half surge in rig activity in North America will be adversely
affected.''
   For the year to date, Schlumberger reported net income of $245
million, or 90 cents a share, compared to $35 million, or 13 cents
a share in the first six months of 1987. Revenue totaled $2.65
billion, up from $2.21 billion in the year-ago period.
   Schlumberger performs specialized service to oil drillers and
producers in addition to making equipment and machinery.

<HEAD>Data General Returns To Profitability; Apollo Reports Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp. posted a profit in its latest quarter, while
Apollo Computer Inc. had a loss, the computer makers announced
Thursday.
   Data General, the minicomputer company based in Westboro, Mass.,
said it earned $1.9 million, or 6 cents a share, in its third
fiscal quarter in contrast to a loss of $65.1 million a year
earlier that included a one-time charge of $53.8 million for
restructuring and cost-reduction. Second-quarter revenue rose 5.5
percent to $330.7 million from $313.6 million.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Data General said
it earned $31.5 million, or $1.06 a share, compared to a loss a
year earlier of $104.4 million. Revenue rose 8.6 percent to $1.02
billion from $942 million a year earlier.
   ``While we remain profitable, we are disappointed with the level
of revenues generated in the current quarter,'' Edson D. de Castro,
the president, said in a written statement. He said profits had
been hurt by increased hiring in research and development and
sales, which will eventually help results.
   Apollo Computer, a maker of computer workstations based in
Chelmsford, Mass., had warned investors earlier this month that it
expected a loss of $5 million to $8 million in the quarter. It
reported it lost $7.9 million in contrast to a profit of $7.6
million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 9 percent to $143.5 million from $132.2 million.
   For the first six months, Apollo earned $2.5 million, or 7 cents
a share, down from a profit of $14.0 million, or 39 cents a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose 22 percent to $312.4 million from
$255.6 million.
   Apollo has blamed the sales shortfall primarily on customers'
holding off while waiting for new products, and the failure of its
West German subsidiary to meet its plan. Analysts have said Apollo
is facing intense competition from Sun Microsystems Inc., its chief
rival in the workstation market. Workstations are similar to
personal computers, except more powerful.

   General Motors Corp. said today its net profit
rose 53 percent in the second quarter from a year ago, but the
increase would have been 28 percent if an accounting change had
been made retroactive.
   The company attributed the strong gain to record-breaking
overseas results and improved performance in North America.
   The world's largest automaker said it had an after-tax profit of
$1.5 billion, or $4.52 a common share, in the April-June period,
compared with earnings of $980.3 million, or $2.80 a common share,
in the same quarter a year earlier.
   The company said, however, that if an accounting change made in
the third quarter of 1987 had been applied to the second-quarter
results for 1987, its profit for the year-ago period would have
been $1.17 billion, or $3.39 a share.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 12 percent to a record $29.9 billion
from $26.7 billion.
   In the first six months of 1988, GM earnings rose 36.8 percent
to $2.6 billion, or $7.63 a common share, from $1.90 billion, or
$5.42 a common share, a year earlier.
   The company said that if the accounting change had been
retroactive to the entire first half of 1987, the year-ago profit
would have amounted to $2.29 billion, or $6.65 per common share.
   Six-month revenue rose 6.6 percent to $56.3 billion from $52.8
billion.
   GM changed the way it depreciates plants, tools and equipment in
the third quarter of 1987.
   In a statement, GM said the results reflect ``its increasing
competitive North American automotive operations _ both in terms of
strengthening market position and improving operating efficiency.
Further, overseas earnings in 1988 are exceeding the record levels
achieved in 1987.''
   In 1987, GM barely broke even building and selling cars and
trucks in North America. Much of its $3.56 billion in 1987 earnings
came from accounting changes, tax benefits and record contributions
from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries.
   On Wednesday, GM reported earnings by its three subsidiaries _
General Motors Acceptance Corp., Electronic Data Systems Corp. and
GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
   GM blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings
for an 18.9 percent drop in GMAC earnings to $333.9 million from
$411.8 million a year ago.
   Earnings by EDS, a computer services company, rose a third to
$95.7 million, or 78 cents per GM Class E share, on revenue of
$1.20 billion. That compared with earnings of $72 million, or 59
cents per Class E share, on revenue of $1.08 billion a year ago.
   Hughes' earnings rose 16.4 percent to $163.9 million, or 50
percents per GM Class H share, on revenue of $2.87 billion. That
compared with earnings of $140.8 million, or 44 cents per Class H
share, on revenue of $2.62 billion in 1987.
   Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said they will report
second-quarter earnings next week.

<HEAD>MCA Profits Fall 79 Percent on Toy Write-Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainment conglomerate MCA
Inc. said Thursday its second-quarter profit dropped 79 percent
because of losses on an unpopular toy and an investment in the
struggling toymaker Coleco Industries Inc.
   The movie, music and toy company, which previously announced it
would take a $35 million charge against its second-quarter earnings
on the toy company problems, said Thursday it earned $8.1 million,
or 11 cents a share in the quarter. That was down from $39.3
million, or 52 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Without the charge, second quarter earnings before taxes would
have increased 12 percent over the previous year, the company said.
   Sales for the quarter ended June 30 were $643.6 million, up from
$611.4 million a year earlier.
   The $35 million charge resulted from reducing the value of
Gotcha paint guns in inventory at the company's LJN Toys
subsidiary, and cutting the value of the company's investment in
Coleco, which has filed for protection from its creditors under
federal bankruptcy law.
   Many of the $30 Gotcha guns were returned by unsatisfied
customers and LJN has stopped making them.
   Operating income in MCA's film division was boosted by ``The New
Leave it to Beaver'' TV series becoming available for reruns and by
pay TV availability of the movies ``The Secret of My Success'' and
``Dragnet.'' Operating income rose in the music and book publishing
divisions and decreased in retail, mail order and toy operations.
   In the first half of 1988, MCA reported a profit of $34.9
million, or 48 cents per share, on sales of $1.25 billion. That was
down 49 percent from the profit of $68.1 million, or 90 cents per
share, on sales of $1.14 billion in the first half of 1987.

<HEAD>American Express Reports Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. reported a second-quarter
profit Thursday following a loss a year ago, when the financial
services company joined major banks in raising its loan-loss
provision during the Third World debt crisis.
   The company's Travel Related Services division, which runs its
credit card business, had the biggest growth in income during the
period. But earnings declined for Shearson-Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc. due to lagging expenses from last year's E.F. Hutton
acquisition.
   American Express said it earned $280.8 million, or 66 cents a
share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with a revised
$600,000 loss in 1987. Revenue totaled $5.58 billion, up 21 percent
from $4.59 billion last year.
   Last year's second quarter included a $520 million after-tax
charge stemming from American Express Bank's loan-loss reserve
addition to cover shaky loans of less developed countries.
   American Express Bank reported second quarter net income of $32
million, vs. a $456 million loss a year ago.
   Many other big banks also suffered losses after taking similar
action as a result of Brazil's decision to suspend interest
payments on most of its foreign bank debt and the rise of
concessionary debt repayment plans negotiated by several Third
World countries.
   The 1987 quarterly results were restated to include $73 million
of tax-deferred benefits due to accounting changes.
   For the first half of the year, American Express netted $546.5
million, or $1.28 a share, on revenue of $10.95 billion. That
compared with last year's earnings of $313.3 million, or 70 cents a
share, and $8.74 billion in revenue.
   ``It was an outstanding quarter that demonstrated the soundness
of the strategies each of our business units has been
implementing,'' Chairman James D. Robinson said of the latest
results.
   At Travel Related Services, quarterly earnings climbed 18
percent to a record $196 million from $167 million. Revenue totaled
$1.8 billion, up 20 percent from last year.
   The company said its credit-card charge volume reached an
all-time high of $22.1 billion, up 20 percent from 1987 and
enhanced by its purchase protection plan and the popularity of its
Optima card overseas. Travelers checks sales also rose.
   IDS Financial Services had a 21 percent jump in earnings to a
record $36 million from $30 million, American Express said. The
company said sales of annuity and investment certificates led the
increase, but sales of mutual funds, limited partnership and life
insurance fell.
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings reported net income of $51
million, compared with $64 million last year. Revenue totaled $2.5
billion, vs. $1.7 billion. The results included a $69 million
pre-tax charge for expenses associated with the Hutton acquisition.
   American Express currently owns 70.6 percent of all Shearson
Lehman's oustanding common shares, and its share of the earnings
was $32 million, compared with $47 million in 1987.

on the consumer price index.
   Technology stocks were notably weak amid disappointment over the
trend in second-quarter earnings reports issued by several
high-tech companies of late.
   ``In the technology sector there seems to be a disaster or two a
day,'' said Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Tandem Computers was the most active NYSE issue, down 2~ at 14{.
The company said its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended June 30

<HEAD>Reports 2nd-Qtr Profit Up Fourfold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inland Steel Industries Inc. said Thursday its
second-quarter profit soared more than fourfold due to strong
demand for U.S.-made steel, higher prices and lower production
costs.
   Inland Steel reported record net income of $79.9 million, or
$2.27 per share, for the three months ending June 30, compared with
$17.5 million, or 44 cents per share, for the same period a year
ago.
   The previous record quarterly earnings of $63.6 million were
reported for the first three months of 1988, the company said.
   Inland's second-quarter sales increased 24 percent to $1.05
billion from $845 million, while steel mill shipments during the
period totaled 1.3 million tons, a 12 percent gain from the
year-ago period.
   For the first half of 1988, Inland had net income of $143.5
million, or $4.06 per share, up 80 percent from $79.9 million,
$2.43 per share, for the first six months of 1987.
   First half sales rose to 19 percent to $2.01 billion from $1.69
billion in 1987.
   A sharp rise in industrial expansion and plant modernization led
to increased demand for structural steel while the dollar's
dramatic fall in value last year against the Japanese yen and West
German mark raised the price of imported steel above that of
domestically produced steel, said Inland spokesman Sam Saran.
   Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said shipments of domestic steel
likely will reach 80 million tons this year compared with 76
million tons last year, and Inland's shipments probably will exceed
the company's earlier estimate of 5 million tons.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was mostly lower in moderate
European trading Thursday, although dealers said central banks did
not intervene against the American currency.
   Gold and silver prices rose.
   Currency dealers in Europe attributed the dollar's decline to
several factors, including unconfirmed rumors that U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker might resign soon, fears of central-bank
intervention and expectations of higher West German interest rates.
   Traders in Frankfurt said the dollar is likely to stabilize and
will probably test its upside potential again early next week.
   ``Somewhere around here it'll find its bottom for the time
being, and then there'll be a reaction upwards again,'' said a
trader at a large Frankfurt bank.
   Dealers in London and Frankfurt said there was no evidence of
central-bank intervention in dollar trading for the first time in
several weeks, although there were reports that the Bank of England
sold sterling for other European currencies to stem the pound's
recent rise.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7265 dollars, more
expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.7085.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.8375 West German marks, down from 1.8520; 1.5275 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5360; 6.2000 French francs, down from 6.2455;
2.0765 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910; 1,363.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,371.50; and 1.1968 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1959.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 133.50. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 132.25 yen.
   In the precious metals markets, speculative buying from
Switzerland and the Middle East and rumors regarding a miners'
strike in Peru forced the price of silver upwards, although
profit-taking slowed its rise.
   Dealers in Zurich said that gold's near-term performance also
will depend on silver, which has towed gold along.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of 4$45.80 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $444.50. In Zurich, the bid price
was $445.50, up from dollars late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.42 to close at a bid $444.43.
   Silver, which hit a high of $7.90 in Europe, finished at a late
bid price of $7.81 a troy ounce in London, compared with
Wednesday's $7.75.

<HEAD>PaineWebber Earnings Skid on Low Market Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PaineWebber Group Inc. reported Thursday its
earnings plummeted in the second quarter as lackluster market
conditions took a heavy toll on the brokerage's revenue.
   PaineWebber said it earned $159,000 in the three months ended
June 30, down 99 percent from $17.6 million, or 53 cents per share
of common stock, in the same period a year earlier. There were no
earnings per common share in the latest quarter after dividends
were paid to preferred shareholders.
   Revenue for the quarter fell to $565.7 million from $637.6
million in the same period a year earlier.
   PaineWebber said its commission revenue fell 32 percent during
the quarter, while revenue from transactions for the company's own
account fell 13 percent. The company reported a 5 percent increase
in its investment banking revenue and a 25 percent jump in asset
management revenue.
   ``PaineWebber's results were adversely affected by lethargic
market conditions,'' company chairman Donald B. Marron said in a
statement.
   ``In particular, our retail business suffered from relatively
low volume as individual investors remained on the sidelines.''
   Other brokerage firms have reported sharply lower second-quarter
profits as market activity remained depressed in the aftermath of
the October stock market crash.
   For the first half, PaineWebber said it earned $20.9 million, or
27 cents per share, down 58 percent from $50.2 million, or $1.58
per share, in the first six months of 1987.
   Revenue for the period declined to $1.17 billion from $1.27
billion.

<HEAD>McDonald's Profit Up 19 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. said its profit
increased 19 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
helped by improving profitability in its foreign operations and
several sales promotions in the United States.
   The fast-food giant reported Thursday that its second-quarter
earnings rose to $177.2 million, or 94 cents a share, from $148.7
million, or 78 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1987.
   Second-quarter revenue _ including sales at company-operated
restaurants and fees from franchises _ rose 14 percent, to $1.43
billion from $1.24 billion. More than 75 percent of the McDonald's
restaurants in the United States are franchised.
   Forty percent of the more than 500 new restaurants to be added
each year will be located outside the United States, Chairman Fred
L. Turner said in a press statement.
   ``Maximizing sales at existing restaurants is accomplished
through attention to operations, reinvestment, product development
and refinement, and effective marketing programs,'' Turner said. He
noted that the company's foreign operations are achieving economies
of scale, bringing an improvement in profitability.
   The company is continuing to monitor the effects of the drought
in the Farm Belt on its food commodity costs, said President and
Chief Executive Officer Michael R. Quinlan.
   He noted that McDonald's food costs as a percent of its sales
have declined in both the first and second quarters of this year
compared with 1987. In addition, more than 30 percent of the
company-operated restaurants are located outside of the United
States, and are not necessarily affected by the drought.
   In the first half of the year, McDonald's earnings rose 19
percent _ to $303 million, or $1.61 a share, from $255.7 million,
or $1.34 a share, in the first six months of 1987.
   First-half revenue was up 15 percent, to $2.65 billion from
$2.31 billion a year earlier.

   Textron Inc. reported a 24.3 percent
decline in its second-quarter earnings Thursday that it attributed
in part to a seven-week strike at a Connecticut subsidiary.
   The company, which has interests in aerospace technology,
commercial products and financial services, reported net income of
$68.9 million, or 78 cents a share, for the three months ending
July 2, compared to $91 million, or $1.06 a share, for the same
period a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenues were $1.81 billion, down from $1.82
billion a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the fiscal year, net income was
$107.3 million, or $1.21 a share, compared to $151.2 million, or
$1.79 a share, a year earlier. Revenues for the first half of 1988
slipped to $3.63 billion from $3.66 billion a year earlier.
   The 1988 results included a first-quarter extraordinary loss of
$29.7 million after taxes.
   Textron Chairman B.F. Dolan said in a news release that the
strike at Textron Lycoming's Stratford, Conn., plant, hurt the
company's performance. About 2,200 United Auto Workers members
struck the plant, which makes gas turbines for military tanks and
helicopters and civilian aircraft, after the company demanded
give-backs on benefits.
   ``With the recent seven-week strike at the Lycoming division now
settled, we are optimistic that Textron will maintain its
first-half momentum and achieve another year of improved earnings
from continuing operations,'' Dolan said.

<HEAD>BankAmerica Posts Second Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp., the nation's
third-largest banking company, on Thursday reported a profit for
the second quarter after a hefty loss a year ago, when it joined
other banks in raising its loan-loss provision to cover shaky Third
World debt.
   Meanwhile, H.F. Ahmanson & Co., parent company of Home Savings
of America in Irwindale, Calif., the nation's largest savings and
loan, said it netted $48.83 million, or 50 cents a share in the
second quarter. That compared with earnings of $34.36 million, or
35 cents a share, in 1987.
   Gains from loan sales were partly responsible for the increase,
the company said.
   BankAmerica said its net income for the three months ended June
30 totaled $162 million, or 85 cents a share, compared with loss of
$1.13 billion in 1987.
   During last year's quarter it added $1.1 billion to its reserves
for possible losses on loans to less developed countries. Many
other big banks had taken similar action, and consequently, lost
money or saw their earnings decline.
   Several special items affected BankAmerica's second-quarter
results, raising net income by $8 million.
   A $46 million legal settlement received by Seafirst Corp.
increased net income on an after-tax basis by $43 million. An $11
million net charge was included in non-interest expense because of
a customer promotional program, but was partially offset by other
gains.
   For the first half of this year, BankAmerica netted $271
million, or $1.41 per share. That compared with a $1.07 billion
loss a year ago.
   Chairman A.W. Clausen said the second-quarter earnings _ the
fourth straight quarter of operating profitability _ demonstrated
the strength of the bank's recovery.
   ``Higher interest revenues in the quarter were due to growth in
loan volume of $1.7 billion, an increase in the net interest
margin, and lower nonaccrual assets,'' he said. ``Net credit losses
also continued to decline. In addition, our increasing
profitability contributed to growth in our capital base.''
   The quarterly results exceeded some analysts' expectations.
   ``The numbers look quite good, better than we expected,'' said
Donald K. Crowley, of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in San
Francisco. ``The margins look strong. This recovery appears to be
sustainable for the future. I can't find anything I consider
negative.''
   ``There's no question they're making progress,'' added Dan
Williams, of Sutro & Co. Inc. in San Francisco. ``They had a very
low level of net loan losses and most of the numbers appear to be
moving in the right direction.''
   The industry's highest estimate for BankAmerica earnings for the
second quarter had been about 75 cents per share.

   Soybean futures closed mixed while corn and wheat
finished sharply higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in
volatile trading that reflected an uncertain weekend weather
picture and weakening technical factors.
   Private forecasts for a mostly dry weekend in the Midwest and a
return to 100-degree temperatures as early as Monday supported the
soybean market through midday, analysts said. Conflicting
predictions for a wetter weekend kept prices from rising sharply.
   But the failure of the August soybean contract to rally above
$8.58 a bushel convinced several large investment firms it was time
to sell. Others joined in and the August soybean price plunged
nearly 40 cents before rebounding to close above $8.40 a bushel.
   ``There was definitely some disappointment that we couldn't get
much of a rally going, and they sunk her into the hold there for a
while,'' said Jerry Gidel, grains analyst with G.H. Miller & Co., a
Chicago-based trading firm.
   Corn and and wheat gained on expectations for new export
business, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 4 cents to 6{ cents higher with
September at $3.87 a bushel; corn was 5\ cents to 10 cents higher
with September at $3.17 a bushel; oats were 12 cents lower to 8
cents higher with September at $2.67{ a bushel; soybeans were 12{
cents lower to 15 cents higher with August at $8.44 a bushel.

   Second-quarter profits were up 5.5 percent at Bell Atlantic
Corp. and flat at Nynex Corp., while stock offerings contributed to
earnings gains of 25 percent at U S West Inc. and 121 percent at
Contel Corp., the phone companies said Thursday.
   Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based regional Bell holding
company, said its earnings rose to $344.1 million, or $1.74 a
share, from $326.1 million, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell 2.3 percent to $2.58 billion from $2.64 billion.
   For the six-month period, Bell Atlantic said its earnings rose
to $673.2 million, or $3.40 a share, from $633.6 million, or $3.18
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $5.08 billion from $5.11
billion.
   Nynex, the New York-based regional Bell company for New York and
New England, said its profit edged up to $322.8 million from $322.7
million a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.64 from $1.58
because of a stock buyback. Revenue rose 5.3 percent to $3.17
billion from $3.01 billion.
   For the first six months of the year, Nynex said its profit rose
to $633.9 million, or $3.18 a share, from $621.9 million, or $3.05
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $6.24 billion from $5.90
billion.
   U S West, the regional Bell company based in Denver, said it
earned $336.3 million, or $1.83 a share, up from $268.8 million, or
$1.42 a share, a year earlier. The results were helped by an
after-tax gain of $88.7 million from the sale of stock in its
cellular and paging subsidiary. Revenue rose to $2.21 billion from
$2.11 billion.
   For the first six months, U S West said its earnings rose to
$576.8 million, or $3.13 a share, from $473 million, or $2.49 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5.3 percent to $4.37 billion
from $4.15 billion.
   Contel, a non-Bell company based in Atlanta that provides local
phone service in 31 states, said its profit rose to $104.5 million,
or $1.32 a share, from $47.4 million, or 61 cents a share, a year
earlier. Those results include an after-tax gain of $43.4 million
from a stock offering in its cellular phone subsidiary.
   Excluding the stock offering and other one-time factors,
earnings per share from recurring operations rose 20 percent,
Contel said.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 12 percent to $788.3 million from
$703.8 million.
   For the first six months of fiscal year, earnings rose to $163.4
million, or $2.07 a share, from $102.4 million, or $1.38 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.53 billion from $1.39 billion.

<HEAD>GM Reports Strong Improvement for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. reported Thursday that its
profit rose strongly in the second quarter as overseas operations
had a record-breaking performance and sales picked up in North
America.
   Financial analysts said the gains in domestic sales should cheer
the world's largest automaker, which has seen its U.S. market share
eroded in recent years.
   GM had after-tax earnings of $1.5 billion, or $4.52 a share, in
the April-June period, the company's best quarterly profit in four
years. That was up 53 percent from a net of $980.3 million, or
$2.80 a share, in the same quarter of 1987, but GM noted the gain
would have been about 28 percent if an accounting change had been
made retroactive to the first half of last year.
   GM said its profit for the 1987 period would have been $1.17
billion if the change had been in effect.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 12 percent to $29.9 billion from
$26.7 billion, surpassing GM's previous quarterly sales record of
$27.6 billion set in 1986.
   ``General Motors' improved profitability reflects its increasing
competitive North American automotive operations _ both in terms of
strengthening market position and improving operating efficiency,''
GM Chairman Roger Smith and President Robert Stempel said in a
joint statement.
   ``Further, overseas earnings in 1988 are exceeding the record
levels achieved in 1987,'' they said.
   For the first six months of 1988, GM had a profit of $2.6
billion, or $7.63 a share, on revenue of $56.3 billion. That was up
13.3 percent from the $2.29 billion, or $6.65 a share, it would
have earned on revenue of $52.8 billion a year ago, if the
accounting change had been in effect.
   GM slowed the rate of depreciation of plants, tools and
equipment beginning in the third quarter of 1987 to match
depreciation schedules used by its auto industry competition.
   Financial analysts were upbeat over GM's sales gains for the
quarter.
   ``The number of units produced per employee went up almost 17
percent versus second-quarter last year,'' said Ronald Glantz at
Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``That's phenomenally
good, showing the kind of earnings General Motors can have if sales
pick up.''
   In its announcement, GM said: ``Our main challenge is to
continue to build profitability in our North American automotive
business and to profitably raise our market share. We are committed
to managing our cost levels so that they are consistent with market
share.''
   The analysts agreed.
   ``Last year, (sales) volume was so low that most of their gains
came from accounting changes,'' said Kathleen Heaney with Nikko
Securities International in New York. ``This year, it seems based
on volume. Sales were strong in the first half, particularly in the
second quarter.''
   GM said that as of June 30, it had implemented $2.7 billion of
the $4 billion in cost cuts it plans to make during 1988.
   GM said it sold 2.25 million cars and trucks worldwide during
the quarter, which was up 9.3 percent from the previous year.
   The company said it held 35.1 percent of the U.S. market for
cars and light trucks built in North America. That was up slightly
from 33.8 percent at the end of June 1987.
   Last year, GM barely broke even building and selling cars and
trucks in North America. Much of its $3.56 billion in 1987 earnings
came from accounting changes, tax benefits and record contributions
from its streamlined overseas businesses and its subsidiaries.
   But in the second quarter of 1988, operating income rose 64
percent, to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion a year ago. It rose 16
percent in the first six months, to $2.4 billion from $2.1 billion.
   GM reported Wednesday that earnings for the quarter rose 33
percent at its Electronic Data Systems subsidiary and 16.4 percent
at GM Hughes Electronics. Earnings were down 18.9 percent at
General Motors Acceptance Corp.

   Stock prices slipped into a broad decline in
quiet trading today, reversing Wednesday's rally.
   The dollar lost ground against leading foreign currencies, and
interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell nearly $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 9.25-9.35 percent
range.
   Analysts said traders were showing little interest in chasing
after stocks in advance of the government's monthly report Friday
on the consumer price index.
   Technology stocks were notably weak amid disappointment over the
trend in second-quarter earnings reports issued by several
high-tech companies of late.
   ``In the technology sector there seems to be a disaster or two a
day,'' said Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

<HEAD>Drug Companies Report Earnings Rises in Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three major pharmaceutical producers, Pfizer Inc.,
Schering-Plough Corp. and Squibb Corp., reported higher earnings
for the second quarter Thursday.
   Pfizer, based in New York, said its net income in the quarter
rose 21 percent on a worldwide sales gain of 9 percent. Net income
was $213.1 million, or $1.26 per share, vs. $175.8 million, or
$1.03 per share in the same period a year ago. Sales rose to $1.34
billion from $1.23 billion.
   For the first six months of 1988, net income was up 18 percent
to $432.9 million, or $2.57 per share, from $367.8 million, or
$2.16 per share. Revenue was up 12 percent to $2.63 billion from
$2.35 billion.
   The company said it had gains in all five of its business
segments: health care, agriculture, consumer products, materials
science and specialty chemicals. The health care sales gain
included significant growth in both pharmaceuticals and hospital
products, Pfizer said.
   Schering-Plough, of Madison, N.J., said its second-quarter
earnings jumped 22.4 percent on a sales gain of 9.8 percent.
   Net income was $101.0 million, or 90 cents per share, compared
with $82.5 million, or 71 cents per share. Sales totaled $752.6
million, vs. $685.3 million a year ago.
   For the six months, income was up 21 percent to $202.5 million,
or $1.81 per share, from $167.4 million, or $1.43 per share. Sales
rose 10 percent to $1.51 billion from $1.37 billion.
   The company attributed the earnings growth to strong gains in
its international pharmaceutical business and domestic consumer
operations. In addition to its drug sales, the company said sales
of contact lenses and Maybelline cosmetics also advanced.
   Squibb, of Princeton, N.J., said net income rose 20 percent on a
21 percent increase in sales. Earnings totaled $114.1 million, or
$1.16 per share, compared with $95.2 million, or 91 cents. Sales
were $644.6 million, up from $532.2 million.
   For the six months, income rose 25 percent to $205.0 million, or
$2.05 per share, from $164.6 million, or $1.57 per share. Sales
gained 24 percent, to $1.24 billion from just over $1 billion.
   Along with strong drug sales, the company said favorable
exchange rates also contributed to its good performance. It noted
that the Food and Drug Adminstration gave permission during the
quarter for Squibb to recommend expanded use of Capoten, its drug
used in treatment of congestive heart failure.

   Assets of the nation's 443 money market mutual
funds rose $276.2 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $266.61 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.39 billion increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 220 general purpose funds rose $284.2 million to $82.93
billion, assets of 100 broker-dealer funds increased $302.5 million
to $114.47 billion, and assets of 123 institutional funds declined
$310.5 million to $69.21 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.81 percent from 6.70 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 6.70 percent from 6.64 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
35 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.79 percent as of Wednesday from 5.77 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.13 percent from 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.28
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.21 the
previous week. Yields were 7.58 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.51
percent; 7.93 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.89 percent; and
8.32 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.28 percent.

   The dollar declined sharply Thursday against all
major currencies despite the absence of significant central-bank
intervention, while a strong British pound took center stage in
worldwide foreign-exchange trading.
   Gold prices fell after advancing overseas. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a late bid of $441.50 for a troy ounce of
gold, down $3 from Wednesday.
   Currency traders said the dollar started out lower overseas due
to several factors, including nervousness of possible central-bank
dollar-selling and a report from an unidentified Bank of Japan
official that there was room for the dollar to decline further.
   ``That immediately caused the dollar to sell off in pretty
hectic trading in Europe and that continued here,'' explained James
T. McGroarty, a trader for Discount Corp.
   Dealers said there was no evidence of significant central-bank
intervention in dollar trading for the first time in several weeks,
although there were reports that the Bank of England sold sterling
for other European currencies to stem the pound's recent rise.
   McGroarty said traders are bullish on the pound due to the
strong British economy and the prospect for higher interest rates,
among other things.
   ``People are really taking a non-commital view of the dollar but
they're looking at sterling,'' he said.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7265, more expensive than
late Wednesday's $1.7085. Later, in New York, sterling fetched
$1.7280, up from $1.7054.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 133.50 yen. But it fell in
London to 132.25 yen, and in New York to 131.575 yen from 133.775
yen late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.8375 West German marks, down from
1.8555; 1.5278 Swiss francs, down from 1.5392; 6.1980 French
francs, down from 6.2535; 1.1979 Canadian dollars, down from
1.19835; and 1,360.125 Italian lire, down from 1,373.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.8375 West German marks, down from 1.8520; 1.5275 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5360; 6.2000 French francs, down from 6.2455; 2.0765
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0910; 1.1968 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1959; and 1,363.50 Italian lire, down from 1,371.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $441.80 a troy ounce from $444.80 late Wednesday.
   However, gold rose in London to a late bid of $445.80 an ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $444.50. In Zurich, the late bid was
$445.50 an ounce, up from $445 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.42 an ounce to close at
$444.43.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell on the New York Comex,
to $7.737 a troy ounce from $7.827 late Wednesday.
   Silver, which hit a high of $7.90 an ounce in Europe, finished
at a late bid price of $7.81 a troy ounce in London, compared with
Wednesday's $7.75.
   European dealers said speculative buying from Switzerland and
the Mideast and rumors regarding a miners' strike in Peru forced
the price of silver upwards, although profit-taking slowed its rise.

<HEAD>West, Mead Settle Lawsuits Over Computerized Legal Research Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BAENEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Publishing Co. and Mead Data Central
Inc. have settled their court battle for control of the
computer-assisted legal research marketplace, the two companies
announced Thursday.
   West attorney Vance K. Opperman said ``both parties finally came
to the realization that the diversion of time and money would be
better spent focused on the market.''
   Two federal judges helped settle the three lawsuits between the
competitors, which dominate a rapidly growing market that generates
more than $200 million in annual sales.
   Both companies had sued and countersued in federal courts in
Minnesota and Ohio, accusing each other of copyright and
restraint-of-trade violations in connection with West's Westlaw
computerized legal research service and Mead's competing Lexis
service.
   The settlement was reached late Wednesday, said Dorothy Molstad,
director of public relations for St. Paul-based West, a major
lawbook publisher.
   Under terms of the settlement, MDC will pay West license fees
for the use of the case report arrangements from West's copyright
National Reporter System publications on MDC's Lexis system,
according to the statement.
   West's National Reporter System publishes judicial opinions from
every state and federal court. Westlaw already includes case
arrangements from that system.
   MDC, a subsidiary of Mead Corp., a paper products manufacturer
based in Dayton, Ohio, also will be granted a license to add West's
compilations of various state statutes to Lexis, the statement said.
   Opperman said he thinks the two companies decided to stop
spending their resources in the courtroom and instead fight it out
in the market.
   ``I think both companies feel that their business is in the
marketplace, their business is not in the courtrooms, and they
would like to return and focus all their resources on what they do
best, which is serve their customers and develop their products,''
he said.
   The two sides had been negotiating for the last 2{ months,
Opperman said.
   Michael Winter, director of communications for MDC, said the
company wanted to get the service to its customers as soon as
possible.
   ``This was an opportunity for us to get for our customers what
we need through negotiations instead of litigation,'' Winter said.
   Settlement discussions took place in the chambers of U.S.
District Judge James M. Rosenbaum in Minneapolis, the statement
said.
   As a result of the settlement, Rosenbaum and U.S. District Judge
Walter H. Rice of Dayton have each dismissed the lawsuits pending
before them with prejudice, meaning they cannot be brought again,
the statement said.

   The stock market suffered a broad setback in
quiet trading Thursday, faced with a weak dollar and rising
interest rates.
   Technology stocks posted some of the most notable losses amid a
continuing barrage of earnings disappointments in the group.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 13.34 points on
Wednesday, fell 24.01 to 2,086.59. Since the start of the week the
average has dropped 42.86 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
412 up, 1,062 down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.46 million
shares, against 151.99 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 176.07 million shares.
   The dollar lost ground against leading foreign currencies, and
interest rates rose in the credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell nearly $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 9.25-9.35 percent
range.
   Analysts said traders were showing little interest in chasing
after stocks in advance of the government's monthly report Friday
on the consumer price index.
   Furthermore, brokers said, selling of high-profile technology
stocks had a depressing effect on the overall market.
   ``In the technology sector there seems to be a disaster or two a
day,'' said Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Tandem Computers was Thursday's most active NYSE issue, down 2}
at 14|. The company said its earnings for the fiscal quarter ended
June 30 came to 18 cents a share, down from 26 cents in the like
period a year earlier.
   Data General, which posted a $1.8 million quarterly operating
profit that fell short of expectations on Wall Street, dropped 2[
to 20\.
   Among other computer and technology stocks, Motorola dropped 1|
to 47]; Hewlett-Packard 1~ to 50}, and Microsoft 3 to 61 in the
over-the-counter market.
   On the plus side, Macmillan Inc. rose 4\ to 82~. The company
said it received an $80-a-share takeover proposal from Maxwell
Communications, topping a $75-a-share bid launched earlier in the
week by the Robert M. Bass Group.
   Pillsbury gained 1| to 36{, propelled by takeover speculation.
   Mead Corp. climbed 2| to 38{. Analysts cited enthusiasm over
prospects for a new type of color copier paper the company is
preparing to produce.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $27.43 billion, or 1.02
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

   The nation's money supply rose in the week ended
July 11, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, known as
M1, rose to a seasonally adjusted $784.3 billion from a revised
$777.2 billion the previous week.
   A broader measure, M2, rose to a seasonally adjusted $3.028
trillion in the week ended July 11 from $3.023 trillion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3.818 trillion from $3.807 trillion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $773.9 billion, a 6.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks.
   The Fed said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for
annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent,
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5
percent. The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $423 million,
compared with a gain of $396 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $500 million, down from $1.332 billion.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $2.789 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, unchanged from two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Crop Futures: Mixed Reaction to Mixed Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A varied crop of weather forecasts set the grain and soybean
futures markets on edge Thursday and prices teeter-tottered to a
mixed close. Wheat and corn advanced, oats were mostly lower and
soybeans were mixed.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures moved sharply
higher; energy futures advanced; precious metals slipped; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   A National Weather Service forecast predicting a return to hot,
dry conditions in the drought-striken Midwest by the middle of next
week supported crop futures on the Chicago Board of Trade and
helped stem a three-day slide in the corn pit, analysts said.
   But traders in the volatile soybean market, who had seen the
price for August delivery plunge a total of $1.35 a bushel over the
previous three days, were reluctant to buy in the face of forecasts
predicting rain the Farm Belt on Sunday.
   ``You've got some conflicting weather forecasts, with some
private forecasters calling for a little more than the National
Weather Service,'' said Joel Karlin, research analyst for Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Analysts said the soybean market remains extremely sensitive to
any weather changes, which will have a heavy impact on yields as
the crop moves from its pod-forming to its pod-filling stage during
the next two or three weeks.
   A storm system that moved slowly through the Midwest earlier
this week helped the soybean crop recover and drove the price for
August delivery of soybeans down to $8.56{ a bushel by the close of
trading on Wednesday.
   The price fell another 14 cents Thursday to $8.42{, well below
the recent high of nearly $11 reached on June 23 but substantially
above $6.90, the price for near-month delivery of soybeans on May
2, just before the drought rally began in earnest.
   Analysts said the failure of the August soybean contract to
rally above $8.58 a bushel on Thursday convinced several large
investment firms it was time to sell. Others joined in and the
August soybean price plunged nearly 40 cents before rebounding.
   ``There was definitely some disappointment that we couldn't get
much of a rally going, and they sunk her into the hold there for a
while,'' said Jerry Gidel, grains analyst with G.H. Miller & Co., a
Chicago-based trading firm.
   Rumors that the Soviet Union had purchased some U.S. corn lent
additional support to corn futures, and expectations of new export
business gave the wheat market a boost, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 6 cents higher with September at $3.86{
a bushel; corn was 5\ cents to 10\ cents higher with September at
$3.17 a bushel; oats were 12 cents lower to 8 cents higher with
September at $2.67{ a bushel; soybeans were 14 cents lower to 25
cents higher with August at $8.42{ a bushel.
   Cattle and pork futures soared on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to an upswing in wholesale demand for beef and
feelings that recent losses in the pork markets had been overdone,
analysts said.
   The October live cattle contract and the August and October hog
contracts advanced the permitted limit of 1.50 cents a pound while
all frozen pork belly contracts finished up their 2-cents-a-pound
limit.
   Shipping volume by beef packers on Wednesday hit its highest
mid-week level since February and packers were paying higher prices
for cattle, said Tom O'Hare, livestock market analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in Chicago.
   Live cattle settled .85 cent to 1.50 cents higher with August at
65.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent to 1.30 cents
higher with August at 76.50 cents a pound; hogs were .52 cent to
1.50 cents higher with August at 44.62 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with July at 37.75
cents a pound.
   Energy futures made strong gains on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on ideas that a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq would
increase the likelihood of an OPEC agreement to limit production,
said Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 34 cents
higher with September at $16.39 a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent
to .93 cent higher with August at 45.53 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .90 cent to 1.66 cents higher with August at 52.10
cents a gallon.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold settled $2.80 to $3
lower with August at $442.70 a troy ounce; silver was 8.5 cents to
9.6 cents lower with July at $7.737 a troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 4.40 points lower at 2676.15.

   Savings banks hold deposits equal to $1,700 for
every man, woman and child in the Soviet Union, which reflects how
difficult it is for people to find anything worth spending their
money on.
   The per capita savings figure of 1,000 rubles represents half a
year's salary for most Soviet workers and the hoard could generate
serious inflation when more consumer goods reach the market. The
figures were given Thursday, in a partial report on Soviet economic
performance in the first half of 1988.
   Savings banks hold personal deposits of 280 billion rubles ($451
billion) for the nation's 284 million residents, said Nikolai G.
Belov, deputy chairman of the Soviet State Committee on Statistics.
   That indicates Soviet citizens have far more savings in relation
to income than people in the United States or other Western
industrial countries.
   Last year, the average American saved only 3.7 percent of his
income, or $488, and Japanese workers put aside about 15.6 percent
of their income, according to The Wefa Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
The average U.S. income was about $13,200 last year.
   Per capita savings were not given on an annual basis in the
Soviet economic report. Soviet salaries generally range between 150
and 200 rubles a month ($242 to $323 at the official exchange
rate), or about 1,800 to 2,400 rubles annually.
   What the latest figures say about the Soviet economy is that
desirable goods are scarce and consumers appear to be stashing
their money in fear of high prices when subsidies are removed from
basic items like food and housing.
   The current five-year economic plan crafted by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his advisers calls for simultaneous increases in
quality and quantity, which Western analysts and some Soviet
economists consider unrealistic.
   Although broad figures Belov gave at a news conference indicated
the Kremlin was seeing the quantity output it has ordered, the
savings figure and a look in any state-run store illustrate the
slow improvement in production of consumer goods and services.
   Only about 10 percent of Soviet families own cars. Laundry is
done by hand in most homes for lack of washing machines and many
adults own just three or four changes of clothing.
   Economist Nikolai Shmelev has said the high savings level
indicates pent-up demand among consumers and is a potential cause
of inflation.
   Savings accounts grew by 42 billion rubles in 1987. Shmelev has
criticized the trend in a series of articles proposing improvements
in economic planning and analysis.
   In a speech to the Communist Party conference last month,
economist Leonid Abalkin echoed Western financial analysts in
saying Soviet leaders get a skewed picture of industrial
performance by measuring quantity but not quality.
   Abel Aganbegyan, another economist, told reporters in late June
the Soviet consumer is no better off now than before the economic
reforms Gorbachev introduced last year.
   ``Unfortunately, the majority of Soviet families are not
witnessing the material benefits of perestroika,'' he said.
Perestroika, which means restructuring, is what Gorbachev calls his
reform program.
   Reform has brought significant changes in personal freedom and
created a more open atmosphere, but little visible improvement in
the marketplace.
   The State Committee on Statistics reported in a dispatch
distributed by the Tass news agency that industrial output from
January through June was 4.7 percent higher than the first half of
1987.
   Soviets face little threat of job loss and are guaranteed state
pensions, theoretically lessening the need to put money away for
hard times or retirement. Housing costs are fixed at 3 percent of
family income.
   Shmelev and other economists favor reforms that would end state
subsidies and make prices of goods and services reflect their
actual cost.
   Soviet officials plan to introduce such changes in the 1990s,
but the growth in disposable cash could generate inflation before
that.
   ``This is a huge potential inflationary pressure,'' a Western
economics attache said. ``We're already seeing this in places like
Izmailovo.''
   Artists gather at Izmailovo Park in northeast Moscow each
weekend to sell their art works and handicrafts for high prices
that shoppers who want unique gifts are willing to pay.

   Polaroid Corp., the target a takeover
bid by a California group, announced Thursday its net income fell
by 17.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier.
   For the three months ended July 3, Polaroid's net earnings were
$22.5 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with a profit of $27.3
million, or 44 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Sales during the quarter rose to $483.3 million from $448.2
million.
   A statement by the instant photography company attributed the
profit decline to foreign currency exchange losses and a jump in
the worldwide tax rate from 34 percent to 52 percent, compared with
the second quarter last year.
   For first six months of 1988, net earnings were $35.3 million,
or 57 cents a share, on sales of $893.4 million, compared with net
earnings of $51.9 million, or 84 cents a share, on sales of $829.3
million for the same period last year.
   The latest report does not reflect Polaroid's restructuring
plan, announced last week, highlighted by 500 to 800 layoffs and
its planned global distribution of conventional color film,
directly challenging Eastman Kodak Co. and Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
   The company also called for the issuance of 10 million new
shares under a mandated employee stock purchase plan and launched a
$300 million company stock repurchase program.
   On Wednesday, Shamrock Holding Inc., a Burbank, Calif.-based
investment firm that has major holdings in Walt Disney Co. and
several media properties, announced a $40-a-share cash tender offer
for Polaroid.
   Polaroid directors plan to meet July 26 to discuss the bid.

   Scott Paper Co. said Wednesday its
second-quarter earnings rose 28.1 percent, and cited the
performance of its international personal care and domestic
printing and publishing papers businesses.
   Scott said it earned $75.3 million, or 98 cents per share, in
the second quarter, compared with $58.8 million, or 77 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter sales rose to $1.16 billion from $1.03 billion a
year earlier.
   Combined sales for Scott Worldwide's personal care and cleaning
business rose 14 percent from last year. The company attributed the
increase to record sales volume and higher prices for some products.
   Sales rose 11 percent and income from operations was up 34
percent for S.D. Warren's printing and publishing papers business.
The increases were attributed to strong demand for coated papers _
Warren's principal business _ combined with price increases
announced in 1987.
   For the first six months of the year, Scott reported its earned
$149.3 million, or $1.95 a share, up from $107.8 million, or $1.41
a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue rose to $2.29 billion
from $1.99 billion a year earlier.

   Hispania Lineas Aereas has purchased four
advanced-technology 737-500 aircraft valued at more than $105
million from Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Boeing announced
Wednesday.
   The airline, based in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, will take
delivery of the 130-passenger airplanes between June and August
1991.
   Hispania, created in August 1982 as a cooperative and
incorporated in October 1987, now operates five new 737-300
airliners and two 737-200s under leases, Boeing said.
   Hispania is the first private Spanish airline to purchase planes
directly from a manufacturer, according to Boeing.
   The new plane features more fuel-efficient and quieter engines,
aerodynamic wing improvements, more on-board stowage area and wider
aisles, the company said.
   The Hispania order brings the total order of 737-500s to 127
made by 12 customers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GAF Corp. reported Wednesday that its second
quarter profit was down sharply from the year-earlier period, when
net income was boosted sharply by one-time gains.
   The Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals and building materials company
had net income of $41.5 million, or $1.45 per share, compared with
a profit of $132.4 million, or $3.71 per share, in second quarter
1987.
   Sales during the quarter rose 24.5 percent, to $266.7 million
from $214.2 million.
   Second quarter 1988 results included one-time gains of $6.1
million, stemming from GAF's holdings of Union Carbide Corp. stock.
Year-earlier results included unique gains of $102.7 million,
including $97 million from the sale of GAF's investment in
Borg-Warner Corp.
   Profit rose by 16.5 percent in GAF's chemicals business during
the quarter, partly due to a weaker U.S. dollar, which helped
international sales, and the inclusion of results from Alkaril
Chemicals Ltd., which GAF acquired in fourth quarter 1987.
   Building materials profit declined by 12.5 percent, due to
increased operating expenses and lower selling prices, GAF said.
   For the first six months of 1988, GAF had net income of $64.2
million, or $2.24 per share, down from $174.1 million, or $4.82 per
share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $483.3 million from $405.3
million.
   First half results included one-time gains of $6.9 million this
year, and $123.8 million in the same period last year.
