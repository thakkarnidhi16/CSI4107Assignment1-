   Ho Chong, who headed the South Korean
government as acting president in 1960, died at his home Sunday
following a long illness, family members said. He was 92.
   The family said Monday that Ho will be buried on Tuesday at the
National Cemetery on the southern bank of the Han River which runs
through this capital.
   He is survived by one son and one daughter.
   Ho was an independence fighter against Japanese colonial rule.
He headed South Korea's caretaker government in 1960 following the
ouster of the late President Syngman Rhee in a student-led uprising
for democracy.

   A sports car crashed into a truck in a
military convoy in western England Saturday and anti-nuclear
activists claimed the convoy was transporting nuclear weapons.
   Police said the driver of the MG Midget car was killed but there
were no other casualties.
   A spokesman for the Defense Ministry said there was no danger to
the public but he would neither confirm nor deny claims a truck
leading the convoy was carrying nuclear depth bombs.
   The accident occurred near Ilminster in County Somerset when the
car struck a bus and then crashed head-on into the huge transporter
truck, according to police. They said the truck was slightly
damaged.
   Members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament said they
trailed the convoy, which they claimed included four warhead
transporters, from the time it left the Burghfield nuclear assembly
facility near Reading, 35 miles west of London, earlier Saturday.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said without
attribution that the convoy was transporting four nuclear depth
bombs to the Royal Navy's armament depot in Plymouth on the south
coast.
   Depth bombs are designed for use aircraft to attack submarines.
   Colin Hines, a spokesman for the environmentalist group
Greenpeace, said Saturday's accident and another convoy accident in
January 1987 were ``a virtually inevitable consequence of the
trundling around Britain of not only 128 Polaris missiles, but also
the little-known 140 naval nuclear depth bombs and 50 naval nuclear
free-fall bombs.
   ``It's time for this nuclear transport to stop and for Britain's
naval nuclear weapons to be put upon the disarmament agenda,'' he
said.
   A spokesman for the Avon and Somerset police said the area was
not evacuated.
   ``We have special contingency plans for situations where an
accident occurs involving a sensitive load. They were not put into
operation in this case,'' he said. He was not indentified in
keeping with British practice.
   The Defense spokesman, also speaking anonymously, called the
collision ``a very minor incident.''
   On Jan. 10, 1987, a 20-ton truck, part of a top-secret military
convoy, skidded off an icy country road near Salisbury in western
England. A large area was sealed off while the military spent 18
hours righting the vehicle.

   A paroled killer with a drug addiction was
arrested Saturday night and charged with murdering a 24-year-old
Arkansas artist a week after she arrived in New York City to study,
police said.
   The suspect, Frank DeChirico, 37, of Brooklyn, was grabbed by
police on a Brooklyn street corner and charged in Wednesday's
slaying of Judith Anne Wrappe of Little Rock, said police spokesman
Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   DeChirico is addicted to crack, the highly potent cocaine
derivative, and was paroled in December 1986 after serving 13{
years for manslaughter, O'Donnell said.
   Miss Wrappe was shot in the chest when she would not give up her
purse to a robber near the Brooklyn campus of the Pratt Institute,
where she had just begun studying for a graduate degree in fine
arts.
   The arrest came hours after hundreds of friends and relatives
gathered at a requiem Mass in her hometown and remembered Miss
Wrappe for her spirit of independence and her vision as an artist.
   ``She wanted to stand on her own,'' said Bishop Andrew J.
McDonald. ``She wanted to prove her independence. That very spirit
found her on the streets of New York on the way home after
finishing her part-time job earlier this week. On that street, the
artist, the hard worker, died, a victim of senseless crime.''
   DeChirico was picked up by police just blocks from the slaying,
at about 7:30 p.m., said O'Donnell. He was booked for murder,
robbery and criminal possession of a deadly weapon, the spokesman
said.
   The last charge involves the alleged murder weapon, which was
not recovered, O'Donnell said. Police had no immediate details
about the suspect's previous manslaughter conviction.
   DeChirico was identified by several witnesses in the area of the
shooting, O'Donnell said. Miss Wrappe was fatally shot when she
refused to surrender her purse to an attacker as she returned home
from her first night at work.
   Witnesses said Miss Wrappe, who was shot in the chest, struggled
with the robber and screamed as he took her purse about 1 a.m. one
block from her dormitory. She was returning home after her first
night at a part-time job as a waitress in Manhattan.
   Police found Miss Wrappe's purse a couple of blocks away, with a
dollar and other objects inside.
   Miss Wrappe, of Little Rock, was a 1987 graduate of Notre Dame
University. McDonald said Miss Wrappe's parents gave their six
children space to ``grow and be themselves. Judith Anne marched to
a different drummer. She set standards for herself. ... She was not
afraid to be different. Judith Anne was an artist _ photography,
water coloring, charcoal, painting.''

   Marshall's, a department store company,
has agreed to pay a $17,500 fine to settle a lawsuit filed by a
customer over a racial incident at one of its stores, the company
said.
   The company said it also has agreed to conduct an anti-racism
training program for its employees. The company announced the
settlement at a news conference in Oakland on Friday.
   Cynthia Sterling, 25, who is black, sued Marshall's after she
tried to exchange an $80 comforter at the Marshall's store in
Newark, about 15 miles south of Oakland. She was shown a memo
written by a store supervisor instructing clerks not to allow
blacks to return bed linens ``for any reason.''
   The supervisor was later fired and the store issued an apology.
   Sterling and the store also agreed to a monetary settlement, but
both sides agreed not to disclose details. The fine was a penalty
assessed by the judge who approved the settlement of the civil
lawsuit.
   In another agreement between Marshall's and the state Department
of Fair Employment and Housing, the store agreed to develop
anti-racism guidelines for employees and distribute them throughout
the chain.
   Marshall's also agreed to develop an internal system to allow
customers to complain if they believe they have been discriminated
against, and to notify the local branch of the National Association
for Advancement of Colored People of progress with the agreement.

   The Reagan administration has sent two messages to
Panamanian military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega in recent days
inviting him to resume bilateral talks that collapsed in May, the
general said in an interview.
   Noriega said he sees the alleged overtures by the U.S.
government as a ``positive step'' and added that his regime is
ready to start ``serious, scientific and realistic'' negotiations
immediately, The Miami Herald reported from Panama in its Sunday
edition.
   U.S. officials confirmed there were meetings with ``members of
the ruling coalition'' in the last few days, but added these were
part of ``regular meetings with a cross-section of Panamanian
political leaders.'' They denied these were proposals for new
negotiations.
   Noriega said he is ready to meet face-to-face with ousted
president Eric Delvalle ``without preconditions,'' if that helps
solve Panama's crisis.
   Previously, Noriega said he would never sit down with Delvalle,
who unsuccessfully tried to fire him as commander of Panama's
Defense Forces early this year.
   Noriega had generally shunned the press since he was indicted
Feb. 4 in Miami and in Tampa for drug smuggling and his country
exploded into political crisis.
   The Herald interview Thursday was at the main office of the
General Torrijos military base in Rio Hato, about 68 miles
northwest of Panama City.
   The U.S. government in May offered to lift two drug indictments
against Noriega, if he would step down. But subsequently,
presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis both said
they oppose any deal that would result in dismissal of the
indictments.
   Referring to the U.S. dispatches, Noriega said, ``We have
received a message from the U.S. Embassy transmitted to us through
(Panama's) commerce minister Mario Rognoni, with suggestions or
open doors to continue the talks that had been suspended.''
   John Maisto, the U.S. Embassy's deputy chief of mission,
delivered the message last Wednesday to Rognoni, Noriega said.
   An embassy official said ``written talking points'' were
delivered describing U.S. positions on Panama, but said they were
summaries of on-the-record U.S. policy. The State Department has
set out guidelines that no further negotiations with Noriega are
expected.
   The Reagan administration has said it still recognizes Delvalle,
who is in hiding in Panama, as the head of state.

<HEAD>Caribbean Religious Group Condemns Haiti's Rulers for Church
Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Caribbean Council of Churches
denounced the killing of 13 parishioners and the burning of two
churches in Haiti and urged the U.S. and Caribbean governments to
condemn Haiti's military rulers.
   But late Saturday, Haiti deposed its military leader, Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy, and two military commanders took power, a government
spokesman said in Port-au-Prince, the Haitian capital.
   It was unclear whether the attacks on Sept. 11 and the following
day, blamed on the government, were related to Namphy's ouster.
   The church council, which represents Roman Catholic and
Protestant churches in 16 Caribbean countries, said the bloody
attacks were ``cold-blooded cruelty which was shocking even by the
brutal standards of Haitian repression.''
   While army critic Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide said Mass Sept. 11
at St. Jean Bosco Church in Haiti, two dozen people armed with guns
and knives attacked killed parishioners before burning down the
building as soldiers watched from across the street.
   Nine were killed in the massacre and 77 were wounded, of which
four died at in the hospital, Radio Haiti Inter said Saturday.
   Five men and a woman that night boasted on government television
they took part in the massacre, and the next day arsonists burned
down a second Roman Catholic church.
   ``The inaction of the government security forces can only be
interpreted as collusion with the method of terrorizing the Haitian
population into silence,'' said the council's statement, released
Friday.
   Though the government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy said it
``regretted'' the massacre and promised to punish the culprits,
similar statements issued after mass killings in the past have
never resulted in investigations or convictions.
   Namphy returned to power after ousting the 4-month-old
government of civilian President Leslie Manigat in a coup June 19.
Namphy previously ruled for two years after the exile to France of
President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier on Feb. 7, 1986.
   But on Saturday, Namphy was ousted in a military coup and taken
to the airport, said Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information.
Lubin said he believed Commander Prosper Avril had been named the
new head of state and Dessalines Barracks Commander Jean-Claude
Paul as new commander-in-chief of the army.

   Almost 200 tourists expressed their relief and
thanks over being home when they landed here Saturday night after
enduring Hurricane Gilbert in Cancun, Mexico.
   Damage in the Mexican resort was extensive, said passengers upon
arrival at Miami International Airport at 8:53 p.m. EDT.
   ``Cancun doesn't exist anymore,'' said Ana Maria Cardoso, who
weathered the hurricane in a hotel. ``We were lucky. Our hotel is a
very old, well-built building.
   ``Unfortunately, those poverty stricken people are really
suffering. They're going to have to start all over again.''
   ``Everybody's glad to be home,'' said Angela Harvey, 23, of
Atlanta.
   The first thing the tourists requested was fresh water, said an
Eastern Airlines crew member.
   Eastern does not normally fly to Cancun, but arranged for an
L-1011 jet with room enough for 316 passengers to pick up the
stranded tourists after the U.S. State Department appealed for
help, said the airlines' chief spokesman, Robin Matell.
   Hundreds of Americans were scattered in shelters in Cancun,
passengers said, but only 196 made it to the airport in time to
take the flight.
   Eastern delayed takeoff for almost two hours and sent members of
the plane's ground crew into town in hopes of picking up more
passengers, but many tourists never got the word, the passengers
said.
   The airline encouraged Miami area hotels to let the tourists
stay overnight free of charge, Matell said.
   ``We're trying to keep their costs to a minimum,'' he said.
   Miami accommodations would be a welcome change compared to the
shelters they stayed in during the hurricane, said Medina
Sutherland, 24, of Chattanooga, Tenn.
   ``They put eight of us in a room with two beds, no power, no
lights, no food and no plumbing for two days,'' she said. ``We had
never met before. Now we're best friends.''
   Gilbert was a fierce storm when it rammed the Yucatan Peninsula
Wednesday, killing 29 people and badly damaging the popular resort
towns of Cancun and Cozumel.
   But after making landfall again Friday in northern Mexico,
Gilbert quickly lost power. It was downgraded to a tropical
depression Saturday.

   Hurricane Gilbert spun off dozens of
tornadoes in Texas that killed at least two people as the nearly
spent storm steamed inland Saturday, a ``huge rain-making machine''
with potential for deadly flooding.
   Thousands of Gulf Coast residents from Louisiana to Texas began
returning home to areas struck only a glancing blow by the main
storm, at one time the most powerful on record in the Western
Hemisphere.
   ``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history
appears to have missed us,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus
Christi.
   Texans inland braced for more twisters and flash flooding, with
as much as 20 inches of rain expected.
   A tornado Saturday evening damaged 50 homes and destroyed 15 in
Del Rio, 150 miles west of San Antonio and just northwest of the
Mexican border, officials said. Two people were treated for minor
injuries and released, but scores of others spent the night with
relatives or stayed in shelters set up in the city, said police
dispatcher Don Weaver.
   Gilbert was downgraded early Saturday to a tropical storm. At
midday, its top sustained winds were 35 mph and it was downgraded
to a tropical depression.
   A woman was killed Saturday when a tornado hit her mobile home
south of San Antonio, some 300 miles north of Brownsville. A man
died in San Antonio when a tree toppled onto his house during a
thunderstorm Friday.
   In Alabama, a man trying to cross a rain-swollen creek in
Tallapoosa County southeast of Birmingham was swept to his death
early Saturday, officials said.
   A tornado heavily damaged a San Antonio apartment complex just
after sunrise.
   ``I just heard a loud, loud roar, like the wind blowing through
the broken patio door in my living room,'' said Wes Spencer, whose
apartment was hit.
   ``I just looked out, I freaked out. The roofs were gone on the
buildings. Cars were tossed all over the parking lot.''
   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros also signed a disaster
declaration for his city so Air National Guard personnel could fly
in parts needed to repair air conditioning at two hospitals hit by
tornadoes earlier Saturday.
   At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamed
on the storm in the Caribbean and Mexico. An additional 200 people
were feared drowned after a river swollen by rain from the
hurricane jumped its banks and overturned four buses Saturday in
Monterrey, Mexico.
   The storm never made an expected turn to the north and spared
the Texas coast, where thousands had fled to shelters after
boarding up homes and businesses along the entire length of the
state's 370-mile coastline.
   Gilbert rolled ashore late Friday afternoon in northeastern
Mexico with 120 mph wind about 150 miles south of Brownsville,
where gusts of 82 mph were recorded at South Padre Island.
   Laurie Swayze Miller, owner of a Harlingen jewelry store, picked
up the pieces after a twister hit her shop.
   ``A policeman found a diamond ring out in the parking lot,'' she
said.
   Wind gusted to nearly 40 mph at midday at Brownsville, but
coastal residents were allowed to return to their boarded-up homes
to begin cleaning up. Damage from the hurricane itself appeared to
be minor.
   South Padre Island and Port Isabel, which had expected to
receive the brunt of the once-fierce storm when it roared ashore,
reopened to the public at noon. Other coastal cities began closing
emergency shelters.
   ``I was surprised because I was expecting a lot of water,''
Eduardo Campiran, South Padre Island city manager, said Saturday.
``We have no knowledge of significant damage. Most of the damage is
like roofs, windows, awnings, this kinds of stuff.''
   South Padre Island Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr. estimated the storm
would cost local businesses $3 million to $5 million in lost
tourist revenue but said he expected business to be back to normal
by next weekend.
   Only a few low-lying coastal roads remained closed because of
flooding.
   The greatest damage appeared to be to trees, with many uprooted
or missing branches.
   ``It just trimmed the trees a little and that's about it,'' Ron
Reynolds, 31, said as he cleaned up around his home. ``My neighbor
back there had a tree go through a fence. We came through it real
lucky.''
   At 11 a.m., the National Hurricane Center put the storm center
220 miles west-southwest of Brownsville and 45 miles southwest of
Monterrey, Mexico, moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph.
   Tornado and flash flood watches and warnings were posted for a
26-county area of southern Texas.
   Inland rainfall of 10-15 inches was likely with up to 20 inches
possible, forecasters said.
   Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rain to the Rio
Grande Valley before heading north up the Mississippi Valley as a
``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center.
   In the 24 hours up to 7 a.m., Brownsville received 4.53 inches
of rain. In Louisiana, Reserve reported 5.7 inches in 24 hours.
   By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley
and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,
forecasters said.
   ``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''
Zimmer said.

   Here are brief profiles of some of the figures in Saturday's
coup that deposed Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in Haiti:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Namphy _ Took over after President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986. Returned to power after ousting
the 4-month-old civilian government of President Leslie Manigat on
June 19. Namphy previously ruled for two years following Duvalier's
flight to France. Namphy said he removed Manigat and his government
because the president illegally blocked the transfers of several
officers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril _ Also adjutant general of the
military, was believed named new head of state, according to Frantz
Lubin, the government's director of information. Many observers
believe Avril, who had been a military adviser to Duvalier, was a
key figure in the coup in June. Avril was head of the presidential
guard when Manigat tried in June to relegate him to an
administrative post before the coup. Avril was an adviser to the
military-led junta until anti-government demonstrations forced him
to resign that post in early 1986.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Col. Jean-Claude Paul _ Commander of Dessalines Barracks and
considered second-most powerful figure in the military after
Namphy, was believed named the new commander-in-chief of the army,
according to Lubin. Behind Namphy, Paul was considered the most
powerful figure in the military regime. In March, Paul was indicted
by a federal grand jury in Miami for allegedly conspiring to import
cocaine into the United States. Paul denied any involvement. The
700-man Dessalines Barracks, the 7,000-member military's largest
unit, lies adjacent to the presidential palace. In June, Namphy
reassigned Paul to an administrative position, but Paul, with
backing from then-President Leslie Manigat, refused. Namphy then
ousted Manigat.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Franck Romain _ Mayor of Port-au-Prince, the capital, until
Duvalier's ouster. Returned to that office in army-run elections in
January and remained after Namphy ousted Manigat. In commenting on
a massacre Sept. 11 in which 13 parishioners were killed at a
church led by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, an outspoken critic
of the military government, Romain said Aristide was ``justly
punished'' by the incident. A former colonel in ex-dictator
Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier's presidential guard and former
chief of police under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Romain denied city hall
had been involved in the killings.

   A Tunisian diplomat has been expelled for failing
to pay hundreds of dollars in parking fines, the Foreign Office
said Saturday.
   The office confirmed a published report in Sunday's editions of
The Mail, in which Foreign Office Minister Timothy Eggar wrote that
administrative attache Sadok Kassous was ordered to leave about
three weeks ago as part of a crackdown on envoys who break the law.
   The article did not give an exact figure.
   The report of Kassous' departure follows the expulsion within
the past week of three diplomats _ Cuba's ambassador, a Cuban
attache and a Vietnamese envoy _in connection with firearms
violations.
   In 1984 diplomats in London failed to pay about 100,000 parking
tickets, he said.
   The newspaper, in a separate article on the expulsion, quoted
Tunisian economic attache Hatem Bergaoui as saying Kassous refused
to pay the tickets because his embassy was allocated three parking
spaces for six diplomats.
   A Foreign Office official said he did not know when Kassous left
the country.
   Cuba's ambassador and commercial attache were expelled Tuesday
after the attache opened fire in a London street and wounded a man.
Cuba said he fired at a CIA operative trying to get him to defect.
   Their expulsion came within days of a Vietnamese diplomat being
ordered out for brandishing a gun at demonstrators outside his
embassy.

   About 450 anti-abortion activists were arrested during
demonstrations Saturday outside clinics where abortions are
performed in New Jersey and California, police said.
   The arrests were the latest resulting from Operation Rescue, a
New York-based organization that has spawned anti-abortion protests
around the nation in recent months.
   Police in Shrewsbury, N.J., arrested about 250 chanting and
singing protesters for blocking entrances to a Planned Parenthood
clinic.
   ``We picked Planned Parenthood because they are the McDonald's
franchise of the abortion industry,'' said Chris Slattery, a
spokesman for Bi-state Operation Rescue Network, which organized
the demonstration in Shrewsbury, about 45 miles southeast of Newark.
   The Planned Parenthood in Shrewsbury is the only one of eight in
New Jersey that performs abortions as well as provide family
planning counseling, said Phyllis Kinsler, executive director of
Planned Parenthood of Monmouth County.
   She said the 15 or so women who had appointments for abortions
for Saturday were warned of the demonstration, but none rescheduled
their appointments.
   ``Ironically, what has happened is that these people scared away
walk-ins who may have wanted birth-control devices or
information,'' she said. ``At the same time, the people who wanted
the abortions were there. They showed up.''
   The demonstrators were taken to the Shrewsbury Fire Department,
where they were arraigned on charges of trespassing and violating a
1984 court injunction that prohibits protests at the clinic.
   In San Francisco, about 200 people were arrested Saturday when
they surrounded the Pregnancy Consultation Center, police said.
   Police Chief Frank Jordan said the arrest procedure was very
lengthy because demonstrators were ``lifted up and carried away,
which is very time consuming.''
   ``We were trying to be as diplomatic as possible,'' said Sgt.
Jerry Senkir. ``But it's obvious these people want to be arrested.''
   In New Jersey, police estimated 250 anti-abortion protesters and
50 counterprotesters demonstrated at the center, which performs
abortions twice a week.
   ``We're just trying to prevent abortions,'' said Liz Brouth, a
spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, which claims 1,000 members in
California.
   Brouth said 250 members and supporters surrounded the facility
starting at 7 a.m. However, police later cleared a path to the back
entrance for employees.

<TEXT>
   A forecast for up to 6
inches of snow gave firefighters prospects Saturday of reinforcing
battle lines against fires that have burned for nearly three months.
   ``This forecast is music to our ears,'' said Ken Dittmer, one of
Yellowstone's area commanders.
   But high winds preceded the storm, with more than 40 mph gusts
in some areas. Firefighters fought a fire that threatened Roosevelt
Lodge because of the winds.
   ``I hope this thing decides to take a nap soon,'' said Capt. Ron
Goetzinger, who heads a team of firefighters from Brainerd, Minn.
``The snow should take care of it. We sure hope so.''
   The storm, forecast to swing into Yellowstone sometime Saturday
night, was expected to leave much of its moisture on the northern
sections of the country's first national park, Dittmer said.
   Fires burning in northern Yellowstone, including the
335,300-acre North Fork blaze, have been the most active in recent
days and got the least moisture from a front that passed through
the park a week ago, according to the commander. That previous rain
represented about the first significant moisture in the park since
spring.
   ``It couldn't come to a better place,'' he said.
   The North Fork fire is the one that burned buildings in the
tourist complex at Old Faithful geyser, and threatened West
Yellowstone, Mont., and park headquarters at Mammoth Hot Springs.
   It and other fires have blackened almost half of the
2.2-million-acre park.
   Despite progress toward containment of the flames with fire
lines, park officials declined even to venture when the blazes
could be called controlled. Officials would say only that they
predict the North Fork, half contained Saturday, may be fully
contained sometime the middle of next month.
   The National Weather Service said showers would change to snow
during the night with accumulations of 4 to 6 inches possible by
Sunday morning. Daytime temperatures were expected to remain in the
40s and 50s through Wednesday, falling below freezing at night.
   ``It's time to break out the sweaters,'' commented park
spokeswoman Judy Jennings.
   She said the fires did not grow Friday despite gusty winds that
whipped up flames after several days of calm.
   Other major fires in the park included the 411,500-acre
Clover-Mist fire in northeastern Yellowstone, 75 percent contained
Saturday, and the 225,500-acre Huck-Mink fire in southern
Yellowstone and the Bridger-Teton National Forest, declared fully
contained.
   Elsewhere, officials gave a day off to some firefighters in
Glacier National Park, where a 35,000-acre fire has resisted
efforts to douse it, and crews were released from another wildfire
as steady rain and snow pelted much of western and central Montana
Saturday.
   The weather bureau issued a winter storm warning for today in
western and central Montana, predicting up to a half-foot of snow
in the foothills and a foot of snow in the mountains.
   High humidity and temperatures in the 40s helped firefighters in
Idaho to keep most fires within the boundaries of the Frank
Church-River of No Return, Gospel Hump and Selway-Bitterroot
wilderness areas. Still active fires had charred nearly 200,000
acres.
   ``The only thing consistently in our favor is winter is
coming,'' said Mary Zabinski, spokeswoman for the Nez Perce
National Forest in central Idaho.
   In Oregon, a $5,000 reward has been offered for information
leading to the conviction of the person responsible for starting a
forest fire that had burned 8,200 acres of the Willamette National
Forest by Saturday. Investigators believe it was started by a
careless hunter with a cigarette.

   A 12-year-old boy was arrested Saturday night
and charged with arson for a fire that nearly destroyed a synagogue
where 15 swastikas also were spray-painted, police said.
   Other youths were still being sought, said a police spokesman,
Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age,
surrendered with a parent to detectives, O'Donnell said.
   He was charged as a juvenile delinquent with arson and burglary
and would be released to his parents for an appearance in family
court at a later date, O'Donnell said.
   The fire, reported early Saturday, started on the main floor of
Orthodox Congregation Rabbinical Institute Sharai Torah in the
borough of Brooklyn, said Sgt. Maurice Howard, a police spokesman.
He said the fire caused extensive interior structural damage.
   ``These people have violated not only the criminal law, they
have violated every law of decency, and people of every religion
have to be horrified that any temple of religion has been
desecrated,'' said Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   Howard said a torah, a parchment scroll containing Scriptures,
was set on fire, and 15 swastikas and some obscenities were
spray-painted on the interior.
   Because the fire and desecration were declared a bias incident,
a task force was formed to investigate the incident.
   The Jewish Community Relations Council said it was offering a
$5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment
of the arsonists.

   Ferdinand Marcos said Saturday that reported
efforts by U.S. officials to indict him for fraud ``are mere
repetitions of charges pending in the Philippines.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that federal officials
have overcome major legal obstacles in their case against the
deposed Philippines leader and likely would ask a federal grand
jury to indict him.
   ``I will not try to guess what the motivation is (behind the
possible federal indictment), but as I have said in the past
several times and so have my lawyers _ we can prove the charges are
false and we have evidence to do so,'' Marcos responded through a
spokesman.
   Marcos said 35 cases are filed in a Philippines court involving
billions of dollars allegedly misappropriated during and after his
20-year rule.
   ``And so, why is there an effort to file a similar case in the
United States which are mere repetitions (sic) of charges pending
in the Philippines?'' Marcos asked.
   The indictment is expected to deal only with alleged of
wrongdoing after Marcos left the Philippines during a
civilian-military revolt that swept Corazon Aquino to power in
February 1986, the newspaper reported.
   According to the report, the investigation focuses on
allegations that Marcos and his wife, Imelda, conspired with others
to violate U.S. District Court injunctions by secretly transferring
ownership of hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen art and
Manhattan real estate bought with Philippine government funds.

   Former Voice of America director Mary Bitterman
led two other Democrats in early returns of the state's primary
Saturday for the right to face Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki.
   Former City Councilwoman Marilyn Bornhorst led three other
former Council members and a community activist in the race to
oppose Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi.
   Voters also chose nominees for 100 federal, state and local
offices.
   In the congressional race, Bitterman led in early returns by
almost 17 percentage points over Honolulu City Councilman Leigh-Wai
Doo and by almost 35 percentage points over former teacher union
executive John Radcliffe.
   Saiki, 58, was unopposed in the GOP primary for the urban
Honolulu district.
   U.S. Sen. Spark Matsunaga, seeking his third term, was far ahead
of a little known Democratic opponent, Honolulu writer Bob
Zimmerman, and was expected to coast to a November victory over the
rancher Maria Hustace, the apparent Republican nominee.
   Hawaii's other U.S. House member, six-term Democratic Rep.
Daniel Akaka, was unopposed in the primary, and no one ran in the
Republican primary. His only opponent in the general election will
be a Libertarian, Lloyd Mallan.
   Fasi, 68, was expected to easily defeat two relatively unknown
Republicans in the GOP primary.
   Bornhorst had a lead of 4{ percentage points over former Rep.
Patsy Mink. Randall Iwase, Dennis O'Connor and Jerry Souza were far
behind.
   Bornhorst, Iwase, and O'Connor resigned their City Council
seats, as required by law, to try to move into the Honolulu mayor's
office. Mink gave up her council seat two years ago to make an
unsuccessful bid for governor.
   Activist Souza has campaigned for more affordable housing.

<TEXT>
   The election campign was generally low key, with little
controversy. In both major primary races, the Democrats stressed
their professional backgrounds and government experience in their
appeal to voters.
   The three Democrats who sought to unseat Saiki became known as
``The Three Amigos'' because of their general agreement on issues.
They aimed most of their criticism at the first-term Republican,
who gained some national exposure last month as the secretary of
the Republican National Convention.
   Bornhorst is the front-runner among the five Democrats running
for Honolulu mayor, according to a recent Advertiser-Channel 2 News
poll. She is also leading Fasi in the poll for the general
election, but Fasi was narrowing the gap and many voters were still
undecided.
   Fasi served three terms as a Democratic mayor but lost in the
1980 primary. He came back as a Republican and won again in 1984.
   Souza gained headlines during the mayoral primary campaign when
he was excluded from a debate because, debate organizers said, he
had less than 1 percent of the vote in a poll.
   Matsunaga, 71, was in Washington for most of the primary
campaign. Zimmerman gained some publicity for his low-budget
campaign when he was arrested for handing out pamphlets at a farm
fair held on city property.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril declared
himself leader of Haiti Sunday after ousting Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
in a military coup. Residents reported hours of gunfire Saturday
near the presidential palace.
   In an address on national television at 2:30 a.m. EDT, Avril
said the presidential guard he commanded had toppled Namphy
Saturday because it was ``sickened'' by the way Haiti had been
governed.
   Avril, a former adviser to President Jean-Claude Duvalier, said
Haiti will respect all international treaties, liberties and human
rights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake of
national reconciliation.''
   Namphy was arrested and escorted under guard to the
international airport late Saturday, a government spokesman said.
   The Dominican Republic announced Namphy and Port-au-Prince Mayor
Franck Romain had requested and been granted political asylum in
its Port-au-Prince embassy. It said they were in the embassy and
would be flown on a military plane to the capital of Santo Domingo
Sunday.
   The reports on Namphy's whereabouts could not be independently
confirmed early Sunday.
   The government reported Namphy's ouster several hours after
shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the presidential
palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for cover in
what appeared to be fighting between army factions, witnesses said.
   Earlier, Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, had told
The Associated Press soldiers were reportedly slain during the
coup, but no casualties were mentioned by Avril.
   Rapid gunfire continued until about 11:45 p.m. Saturday.
   Avril has been a key figure in Haiti's succession of governments
since Duvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986.
   He served as an adviser to a military-civilian junta headed by
Namphy which succeeded Duvalier. Avril was forced to resign that
post in early 1986 by anti-government demonstrations.
   He then participated in the June 19 coup that toppled the
4-month-old civilian government of President Leslie Manigat, who
had tried to transfer Avril from commander of the presidential
guard to an administrative post.
   In his speech at the national palace, Avril promoted himself to
lieutenant general and said he had been forced to act.
   Speaking from the national palace before the presidential guard,
Avril said: ``The presidential guard, sickened by the way the
country has been governed since the 7th of February, 1988 ... has
been forced to act again.''
   Manigat was named president Feb. 7, 1988.
   Earlier, Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, had told
The Associated Press that Dessalines Barracks Commander Jean-Claude
Paul had been named the new commander-in-chief of the army, but
Paul was not mentioned during the address.
   Behind Namphy, Paul was considered the most powerful figure in
the military regime.
   Avril, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in
uniform during his address. He was introduced as ``the most honest
officer in the armed forces'' by Sgt. Joseph Heubreux, who wore
full battle gear.
   He reference to ``dialogue'' followed a similar proposal by
opposition leader Marc Bazin. Bazin, a conservative leader of the
Committee for Democratic Understanding, recently said the
democratic opposition and military government should meet. Bazin
was one of four leading candidates for president in the aborted
Nov. 29 civilian-run national elections.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, Susan Clyde, said early Sunday that
the new government made initial contacts with U.S. officials.
   ``The stated intentions of this new government ... were to
correct the abuses of the Namphy era, and to try to re-launch a
period of change and progress for Haiti,'' she said. ``And
obviously we hope that the government will be able to carry out
these intentions.''
   A usually reliable source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said an army major told him that a group of officers detained
Namphy after preventing him from entering the palace at 4:30 p.m.
   Sources said the fighting involved army factions and members of
the Tonton Macoutes, dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during
the 29-year-old dictatorships of the Duvalier family.
   A French diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity and Radio
Metropole said the shooting, including automatic gunfire, broke out
around 5 p.m. Satuday on the Champ-de-Mars Plaza, in front of the
Presidential Palace and near the army general headquarters and
Dessalines Barracks.
   Several dozen panicked people were seen running away from the
plaza.
   The coup came six days after about 20 thugs invaded the St. Jean
Bosco Roman Catholic church during a Mass being said by the Rev.
Jean Bertrand Aristide, a critic of the military government.
   The thugs, armed with guns, machetes and knifes, killed 13
people and wounded 77 and then set fire to the church as soldiers
watched from across the street.
   That night, five men and a woman boasted on government
television that they took part in the massacre and on Monday thugs
burned down a second Catholic church.
   Some people in the St. Jean Bosco church during the attack said
they recognized several City Hall employees among the assailants.
   Namphy's government said it ``regretted'' the killings. It has
made similar statements after earlier killings but no arrests were
announced.

   Saw Maung, the 59-year-old armed forces commander, also became

   Maung Maung, who took power Aug. 19, had offered to end Burma's
one-party rule hold general elections under a multiparty system as
early as late October.
   But increasingly restive demonstrators said Maung Maung's
authoritarian Burma Socialist Program Party party could not be

government to conduct the polling _ something the authorities had
given no indication they would concede.

governed.
   Earlier Saturday, residents reported hearing heavy gunfire near
the presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting between
military factions.
   Namphy was head of the armed forces, while Avril commanded the
Presidential Guard, a 1,000-man force responsible for protecting
the presidential palace.
   The coup came less than a week after Hurricane Gilbert, one of
the most powerful storms on record, lashed Haiti and killed about
30 people.
   Avril, a former adviser to President Jean-Claude Duvalier, said
Haiti will respect all international treaties, liberties and human
rights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake of
national reconciliation.''
   Namphy was arrested and escorted under guard to the
international airport late Saturday, a government spokesman said.
   The Dominican Republic said Namphy and Port-au-Prince Mayor
Franck Romain were granted political asylum in its embassy in
Port-au-Prince. Romain was a colonel in the Presidential Guard and
chief of police under the Duvaliers.
   Namphy arrived in Santo Domingo about 8:30 a.m. Sunday on a
plane that landed at the private Herrera Airport, according to
Fabio Herrera, deputy foreign minister in the Dominican Republic.
Namphy was accompanied by his wife, Gabrielle, and his daughter,
Melissa, Herrera said. The minister said he believed Romain was
still at the embassy in Port-au-Prince.
   The Haitian government reported Namphy's ouster several hours
after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the
presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for

   Military commander Saw Maung overthrew
civilian President Maung Maung in a coup Sunday, saying it was
necessary to halt deteriorating conditions in Burma, the state-run
Radio Rangoon announced.
   Saw Maung, 59, widely regarded as a hard-line officer and a
right-hand man of former President Sein Lwin, promised to hold
multiparty elections once law and order is restored in Burma, the
radio broadcast said. Sein Lwin resigned Aug. 12 after bloody
clashes between troops and unarmed protesters.
   Shortly after the broadcast Sunday, thousands of people surged
into the streets of Rangoon in a spontaneous rejection of the new
regime and shouted for others to come out of their homes with
weapons.
   The protesters felled trees and threw them across the roads to
obstruct military traffic. But no military movements were spotted
by nightfall.
   The coup came a day after soldiers shot at protesters marching
on government buildings in Rangoon to demand the end of 26 years of
repressive rule by the Burma Socialist Program Party, the sole
legal party. The protests have been led by students and monks and
included striking civil servants.
   Saw Maung, the defense minister and Burma's fourth leader in two
months, identified himself as chairman of the Peace Restoration
Committee.
   A later broadcast named the other 18 military officers in the
committee, including the vice chiefs of the army, navy and air
force. It said authorities imposed an immediate 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
curfew and banned public gatherings but did not specify if that was
nationwide or only in Rangoon.
   All government and state bodies were dissolved, including local
administrations nationwide, it said. All striking government
workers were told to return to work by Sept. 26 or face dismissal.
   Nationwide protests since July have forced the resignation of
two leaders and more recent strikes, demonstrations, looting and
lawlessness have paralyzed the economy and pushed the nation on the
verge of anarchy.
   The statements Sunday said the military had taken over state
authority ``to curb further deterioration of the general situation
in the country.''
   It said military authorities would ``restore law and order,
peace and tranquility in the country ... and ease the daily
livelihood of the people.''
   ``After accomplishing the above objectives, (the regime will)
hold general elections under a multiparty system. Political parties
which accept and practice true democracy can prepare for the
general elections from now on.''
   The broadcast said the election supervision commission formed
earlier by Maung Maung's government would be retained. Maung Maung,
a Western-educated lawyer, on Aug. 19 became the nation's first
civilian leader since the 1962 military coup that installed the
Burma Socialist Program Party.
   Maung Maung offered general elections under a multiparty system,
but demonstrators demanded an interim government to conduct the
polling.
   There had been several signs of military resistance to the
government's response to its opposition.
   Security forces have sided with protesters in several towns,
including Victoria Point in the southernmost Mergui province
bordering Thailand. On Sept. 9, about 500 servicemen mutinied and
joined protest marches in Rangoon in the first major military
defections in the capital.
   On Saturday, Buddhist monks and armed students took over a
government building after a soldier opened fire on two protesters.
The 24 soldiers inside surrendered, and the monks and students
disguised them as protesters and got them past a heavily armed,
100,000-strong mob threatening to behead them.
   Up to 500,000 demonstrators, including striking government
workers and policemen, took part n marches Saturday in Rangoon.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said Saturday the government had ordered
soldiers to support the state and national unity.
   Security forces killed scores of people in quelling student-led
protests in March and June. That set the stage for the July 23
resignation of Ne Win, who had ruled since he staged the 1962
military coup.
   More protests flared after Sein Lwin, a former general,
succeeded him. By government count, at least 112 people were killed
in Rangoon during the riots against Sein Lwin, who resigned Aug. 12
after 17 days in power.
   Protesters blame the rigid socialism of the ruling party for
turning resource-rich Burma into one of the poorest countries in
Asia.

<HEAD>One Year After Deadwood Blaze, Nature `Does Its Thing'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK WARBIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CASCADE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many lament the fires that have
charred much of Yellowstone National Park, a wilderness that went
up in smoke just one year ago already displays lush and diverse
greenery that attracts herds of elk.
   ``The fire created more wildlife habitat than anything we could
have ever done,'' Forest Ranger Morris Huffman said of the Deadwood
Summit fire in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in
the Boise National Forest.
   The fire 250 miles west of Yellowstone burned more than 50,000
acres during the summer of 1987.
   ``It's a natural mosaic now, with open meadows and stands of
timber,'' said forest spokesman Frank Carroll. ``A forest that was
just getting older and deader has now been beautifully revived.''
   Federal land managers, rocked by criticism of their hands-off
approach to dealing with naturally sparked wildfires in wilderness
areas and parks, point to Deadwood Summit as an example of a good
burn. It's a tough sell.
   Fires this summer have charred more than 1.5 million acres in
and around Yellowstone. An early decision to let the flames go
unchecked within prescribed boundaries ignited a firestorm of
controversy, and Interior Secretary Donald Hodel has said a change
is likely.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, a former Interior secretary, and others
have called the ``let burn'' policy a prescription for disaster,
especially during the region's worst drought in decades.
   But while the tourist-dependent communities surrounding
Yellowstone look with apprehension at changes nature will take
generations to erase, others say Deadwood Summit is, and
Yellowstone will be, an ecologically healthier place as a result of
being burned.
   ``When fire goes through an area and turns those trees into ash,
one of the things that happens is that the minerals the tree has
captured during its life are returned to the soil,'' said Tracey
Trent, chief of program coordination for the Idaho Department of
Fish and Game. ``That really increases the productivity of the soil
for a number of years after the fire.''
   Or as Huffman puts it: ``It doesn't take long before nature
starts doing its thing.''
   The Deadwood Summit fire was started by lightning on Aug. 1,
1987, about 25 air miles east of Cascade and three miles east of
the Frank Church wilderness boundary.
   The blaze was doused by rain and snow three months later, after
burning about 40,000 acres inside the wilderness and 11,500 acres
elsewhere inside a 75-mile perimeter.
   ``The Deadwood fire in some senses is an example of how the
natural fire policy can be very successful,'' Carroll said. ``Even
though it burned longer than we predicted and got much bigger than
we predicted, it actually was an outstanding fire from a
forest-management standpoint.''
   Today, the burned acreage is virtually covered with grass and
other forage. Brush is starting to return and the area provided
summer range this year to as many or more elk than before the
blaze, officials said.
   Stacy Gebhards, regional supervisor for the state Department of
Fish and Game, said he has received reports of 150 elk or more on
some meadows. That's good news for hunters, and an archery season
for elk is going on as usual this month, with general elk hunting
opening in the area later this fall.
   Before, there were uniform stands of lodgepole pine like tree
farms, some of it infested with pine bark beetles like those that
left thousands of acres of Yellowstone timber dead and dry. Beneath
the canopy the ground was relatively barren, the smaller, more
succulent plant life crowded out by the trees.
   Now there is the kind of diversity sought in a wilderness by
land managers who try to let nature manage itself.
   Plants like service berry and buck brush have adapted to fire
over the centuries, and some lodgepole pine cones won't release
their seeds until they're burned.
   ``There's probably some pretty good arguments that maybe this
year we should have done something different,'' Carroll said. ``But
the bottom line is, nature heals itself.''

   The ``Rambo of Moon Pie eaters'' is in
serious training to try to become the first man to repeat as the
world champion wolfer of the sweet, gooey, Southern treats.
   ``I've been practicing,'' said Rodney Frazer, a stockman at an
Oneonta discount store. ``I've been eating a Moon Pie every time I
go on break.''
   His boss, John Love, describes him as ``270 pounds of rompin,
stompin, genuine, 100 percent Alabama Moon Pie-eating country boy
who loves Moon Pies like a hawg loves slop.''
   First place in the Oct. 8 contest brings $100, second place $25
and third $15.
   Last year, there were 51 contestants when Frazer won the title
by eating 15 within the 10-minute limit.
   ``He is the Rambo of Moon Pie eaters,'' Love said.
   Moon Pies, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., are made of a thick slab
of marshmallow cream surrounded by thick coats of banana, vanilla
or chocolate.
   ``I like the banana ones best,'' Frazer said. ``You could mix
'em up in the contest but I don't know how good they'd taste.''
   A year ago he fasted a couple of days to get ready, and consumed
a bunch of Rolaids after the Saturday eating bout. ``I was feeling
all right by Tuesday,'' he said. ``They make you feel like you've
got little bricks in you.''
   Although a rescue squad was on hand last year, and will be again
this time, ``nobody choked,'' Love said. ``A few got sick and a few
didn't wait until they got away from the table. It got pretty messy
right there at the end.''

   Hot, humid weather was perfect for
Ruby Begonia and the turkey from Cuero, Texas, outran Worthington's
Paycheck to win the first leg of the 16th annual Great Gobbler
Gallop.
   ``We brought with us the hot Texas weather, the kind of weather
our bird likes,'' Cuero's coach, C.L. Duckett, said after the
southern bird won Saturday at Worthington's King Turkey Days.
   The gallop was started in 1973 to decide which city would claim
the title ``Turkey Capital of the World.'' The first leg is held in
Worthington, the second leg in Cuero, Oct. 8.
   Whichever turkey has the best combined times is named overall
winner. Paycheck has won the last three years and Worthington has a
record of 10-5.
   Neither bird appeared to like the course. At the start of the
block-and-a-half race, both birds headed for the crowds, and
Paycheck initially wanted to go the wrong way.
   Paycheck also picked up two penalty points, based on how many
times the turkey has to be touched to keep it moving on course.
   ``We might have to replace our bird,'' said Paycheck coach Jon
Benson. ``This bird was just too friendly and always wanted to
visit the crowd.''

<HEAD>Boudoir Photo: An Intimate Gift For the Man Who Has Everything</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some women are finding that a boudoir photo makes
the perfect gift for the boyfriend or husband who has everything.
   At Design Studio Chicago, Nancy Binder, a 39-year-old insurance
executive, posed for a photographer while sprawled on a black
leather sofa with an emptied bottle of Dom Perignon champagne and a
black mink coat on the floor.
   She was clad in high heels, sheer nylon stockings, garter belt
and a black silk teddy with the straps hanging off her shoulders.
   ``I was engaged to a man who literally had everything, so for
his birthday I got him this,'' she said of the photos. ``It's
completely opposite of my corporate image. Doing it was a fantasy
for me, something very personal.
   ``I would recommend that any woman do it. Men, too.''
   In the Chicago area, more than 30 studios offer boudoir
photography _ soft, sexy portraits to be given to boyfriends or
husbands.
   A 1986 industry survey indicated that boudoir photography was
the fastest growing segment of the business.
   ``It's stylized photography, a very intimate portrait of a
woman,'' said photographer Daniel Byrnes, who took the shots of Ms.
Binder.
   It also is definitely not a cheap gift.
   Byrnes, who has done this sort of work for four years, charges
$250 or more for a session. Other Chicago photographers quote
prices ranging from $150 to $500.
   But the photographers can give customers their money's worth.
   Mattresses or a strategically draped sheet can be used to hide
fat. After the shots are taken, retouching can eliminate stretch
marks, facial puffiness and dark circles under the eyes.
   ``We know how to make a woman look good,'' Byrnes said.
   Steve Schnur, a photographer at Furia Studios in Chicago, said
customers sometimes ask him to duplicate a pin-up picture or even a
shot from the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar.
   ``Others just say, `Make me look sexy, make me look 10 years
younger,''' Schnur said.
   Men have also started posing for their ladies and there is a
trend toward portraits of couples.
   Paula Ray, 32, a Chicago actress and model, said she had her
picture taken embracing her boyfriend in softly erotic poses.
   ``Posing with my boyfriend made it more personal than posing
alone,'' she said. ``The pictures captured the way we are when
we're together.''
   But sometimes a boudoir photo is not the perfect gift.
   Sherri Northrup, a Chicago writer-publicist, said she paid $800
for a series of color shots two years ago as a St. Valentine's Day
present for her husband.
   Ms. Northrup, now divorced, said her husband hardly reacted.
   ``He just kind of blew the whole thing off, like it was no big
deal,'' she said. ``I should have got divorced right then and
there.''

   Emperor Hirohito suffered from a mild fever Sunday
that forced him to cancel his visit to the Tokyo sumo arena for the
fall wrestling meet, the Imperial Household Agency reported.
   The 87-year-old emperor had a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit on
Sunday morning, and doctors advised him not to attend the matches,
the agency said. It said the emperor's fever dropped to 99 degrees
later in the morning.
   The emperor ``feels well and has a good appetite. He is all
right,'' said an official of the agency, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Doctors said the fever might have been caused by a slight
inflammation of the intestinal tract, according to the official. A
year ago, Hirohito underwent an intestinal bypass operation.

<HEAD>Soviet Critic Hopes Solzhenitsyn's Works Will Be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a great writer whose
works, now banned in the Soviet Union, should be made available in
his native land, a prominent Soviet critic said in an interview
published Sunday.
   The comments on the exiled Nobel Prize winner were made by
Natalya Ivanova and printed in the Moscow youth daily Moskovsky
Komsomolets. They were the most positive remarks on Solzhenitsyn to
appear in the official Soviet press in recent memory and a further
sign of an ongoing reassessment of his works.
   Solzhenitsyn, who spent eight years in labor camps under
dictator Josef Stalin, wrote ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' a
voluminous study of the political repression and purges that marred
Stalin's 29-year reign. Under Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
Stalin and his legacy have been sharply criticized.
   Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970,
was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 and stripped of his
Soviet nationality. He now lives in Cavendish, Vt., and is a U.S.
citizen.
   ``I consider that he is a very great writer,'' Ms. Ivanova was
quoted as telling Moskovsky Komsomolets in a wide-ranging interview
about contemporary Soviet literature.
   ``It is a great misfortune for our literature that the young
generation has been deprived of the possibility of reading his
books. I hope that this abnormal situation will be corrected.''
   Although the greater openness fostered by Gorbachev has led to
the publication of once-banned works by Boris Pasternak, Mikhail
Bulgakov and other Soviet authors, Solzhenitsyn has so far remained
off limits.
   The editor of the literary monthly ``Novy Mir'' has said he is
negotiating for the rights to print Solzhenitsyn's novel ``Cancer
Ward.'' But a work such as the ``Gulag'' triology, which maintains
that wide-scale political repression began in the Soviet Union
under Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin, is still at odds with
official ideology, which pins the blame on Stalin.
   Ms. Ivanova, whose literary criticism regularly appears in the
weekly magazine Ogonyok, also said she believed Solzhenitsyn should
be given his Soviet citizenship back.

<TEXT>
   Mary Bitterman, a former Voice of America
director seeking her first elective office, beat two other
Democrats in Hawaii's state primary and will face first-term
Republican Rep. Patricia Saiki in November.
   Former Democratic City Councilwoman Marilyn Bornhorst won the
right to face Republican Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi after defeating
three other former council members and a community activist in
Saturday's election.
   Voters also chose nominees for 100 federal, state and local
offices.
   Bitterman, 44, received 51,942 votes, while Honolulu City
Councilman Leigh-Wai Doo had 35,579 and former teachers union
executive John Radcliffe trailed with 15,258.
   Saiki, 58, was unopposed in the GOP primary for the urban
Honolulu district.
   U.S. Sen. Spark Matsunaga, 71, had an easy time with his
little-known Democratic opponent, Honolulu writer Bob Zimmerman.
Matsunaga gathered 180,853 votes, or 82 percent, to Zimmerman's
27,360, or 12 percent, and faces Libertarian candidate Ken
Schooland in the general election.
   Six-term U.S. Rep. Daniel Akaka, whose district includes
outlying areas of Oahu and the Neighbor Islands, was unopposed in
the Democratic primary. His only competition in November will come
from Libertarian Lloyd Mallan.
   Fasi, 68, received 36,608 votes, almost 90 percent, to easily
defeat two relatively unknown candidates in the Republican primary.
Gordon Nelson finished second with 1,167 votes and Charles Hirayasu
had 1,035 votes.
   Bornhorst, 61, received 57,097 votes to defeat former Council
members Patsy Mink, Randall Iwase and Dennis O'Connor, and activist
Jerry Souza. Mink got 48,771, Iwase and O'Connor trailed with
22,906 and 21,585 votes respectively and Souza had 3,469.
   Bornhorst, Iwase and O'Connor were required by law to give up
their City Council seats to run for mayor. Mink resigned her
council seat two years ago when she mounted an unsuccessful
campaign for governor.
   There was little bad blood in the two major Democratic primary
races. In fact, the three Democrats who sought to unseat Saiki
became known as ``The Three Amigos'' because of their reluctance to
criticize each other and their general agreement on the issues.
   The Democrats stressed their professional backgrounds and
government experience in their appeal to voters.
   Bornhorst, a 13-year City Council veteran, is the front-runner
in the Honolulu mayor's race, according to a recent Honolulu
Advertiser-Channel 2 News poll. Although she leads Fasi in the poll
for the general election, Fasi was narrowing the gap and many
voters were still undecided.
   Fasi served three terms as a Democratic mayor before losing in
the 1980 primary. He came back as a Republican and won again in
1984.

<HEAD>Newly Combative Dukakis Shows Impact of Aide's Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis had already begun to fire back at
George Bush before former aide John Sasso rejoined his campaign,
but Dukakis has become even more combative since, his sharpened
rhetoric bearing the stamp of the man he likens to a brother.
   Exiled from the campaign a year ago, after admitting his role in
the videotape that helped drive Sen. Joseph Biden from the
presidential race, Sasso returned to Dukakis' side two weeks ago.
And the friends who gathered to welcome him back erupted in
approval when he made a simple declaration:
   ``There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this
campaign. I will not shy away from pointing these contrasts out.''
   All signs since, to borrow a favorite Dukakis phrase, indicate
that Sasso means it.
   The return of Dukakis' longtime political alter ego came at a
time when the Democratic presidential nominee had lost the momentum
he gained from his party's national convention and as he was being
criticized for not responding aggressively to attacks from George
Bush and his fellow Republicans.
   ``Garbage,'' was what Dukakis quickly had to say about the GOP
attacks. Then, seeking to regain the offensive, he took aim at Bush
and his running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, and audiences seemed
to approve.
   ``George Bush has been around Washington a long time, but if he
couldn't stand up to the ayatollah or say no to Noriega, how will
he measure up to Gorbachev?'' Dukakis said in a speech in Chicago.
He then reminded his audience that three vice presidents have
assumed the presidency within the memories of many voters. Said
Dukakis: ``Dan Quayle is no Gerald Ford. He's no Lyndon Johnson.
And he sure ain't Harry Truman.''
   In Dukakis' speeches, tone and at his campaign headquarters,
Sasso's stamp is obvious.
   Dukakis has been more feisty, his staff invigorated and
long-overdue channels of communication with Jesse Jackson and key
members of Congress established.
   ``It was an important development that brought our team up to
full strength and we're delighted,'' said Kirk O'Donnell, the
former Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill aide who was brought in as a
senior adviser to Dukakis after Sasso resigned last September. ``I
think first of all his relationship with the governor is very
important but also his long experience in campaigns. He's a
well-respected, and deservedly so, political strategist.''
   Sasso was the architect of Dukakis' presidential bid, turning
his eye toward the White House even as Dukakis campaigned for
re-election as governor of Massachusetts in 1986.
   Sasso assembled the team, but was forced to leave it behind
after admitting he had a role in the ``attack video'' showing
Delaware Sen. Biden using the words of a British politician without
attributing them. Reports based on the videotape and subsequent
stories about plagiarism put Biden out of the race, but then
stories about Sasso's involvement forced him from Dukakis' side.
   But as Dukakis' campaign lost steam in August, Dukakis recalled
his longtime sidekick for the stretch run of his self-described
marathon.
   Sasso, whose title is vice chairman, has kept a relatively low
profile since returning and declined to be interviewed about his
impact. But other Dukakis aides, some speaking privately, credited
him with taking a number of steps to sharpen the campaign's message
and focus.
   ``He's gotten things moving,'' said one aide who works closely
with Sasso. ``The message is tightening up. The events are
tightened up to help focus on that message, and the need to respond
and respond quickly now has a higher priority here.''
   One example came in Chicago, just days after Sasso's return.
After anti-abortion protesters disrupted his speech and became the
campaign story of the day, Dukakis held an unscheduled meeting with
reporters _ making sure he reclaimed a major part of the story.
   Dukakis aides were careful to avoid belittling Susan Estrich,
who replaced Sasso as campaign manager a year ago. They were
unanimous in praising Estrich for her stewardship in the tumultuous
period after Sasso resigned and for her handling of his return,
which has reduced her role in plotting strategy somewhat but also
allowed her to do what many in the campaign believe she does best _
dissect issues.
   ``It's been a win-win situation,'' a senior Dukakis aide said.
   One asset Sasso brought with him was the power to win Dukakis
over. O'Donnell, for one, was urging Dukakis to respond
aggressively to Bush's attacks. The cautious Dukakis initially
resisted and was just beginning to show signs of aggressiveness
when Sasso was called back _ in effect an admission by Dukakis that
it was time to turn up the heat.
   ``Michael listens to John in a way he doesn't listen to
others,'' said one of the aides who commented only on condition he
not be named.
   Sasso also has extensive contacts in Democratic circles from his
1984 job as manager of Geraldine Ferraro's vice presidential
campaign.
   Estrich was his deputy then and both were involved in the
decision to ask Washington attorney Bob Barnett, who played George
Bush in Ferraro's debate rehearsals, to play the same role this
week as Dukakis begins in earnest his preparations for his first
debate with Bush.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blame it on long campaign days with multiple
stops, jet lag, or whatever. Bloopers are becoming a standard
feature of George Bush's stump speeches.
   ``You ought to vote for me. I knew about Pearl Harbor three
months before it happened,'' Bush joked last week, trying to take
the edge off his mistake about the date of the Japanese attack that
led America into World War II. He had said it was on Sept. 7
instead of Dec. 7.
   Since that foulup, it seems that Bush slips in every speech.
   ``I hope I stand for anti-bigotry, anti-Semitism, anti-racism,''
Bush said in one. ``That is what drives me.'' Later, Bush sent his
press secretary out to make sure reporters knew he did not mean to
say he stands for anti-Semitism.
   Tripping over his oft-stated goal of full employment, the
Republican presidential nominee said he wanted to ensure that
``everybody who has a job wants a job.''
   Usually candidates don't try to improvise on the Pledge of
Allegiance, but that's what Bush aides say he was doing at an
appearance last week after reporters suggested he had stumbled over
the words.
   Bush, who has tried to wrap his campaign in patriotism, said the
flag was the symbol of the United States of America, and then
continued ``and to the liberty for which it stands, one nation,
under God with freedom and justice for all. And let's never forget
it.''
   If he was trying to use the words of the pledge, he should have
said, ``and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under
God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''
   On the same day, he referred back to January 1981 when he was
sworn in with President Reagan.
   Giving himself a promotion, Bush said, ``Ten days before I was
sworn in as president. ...''
   In California with Gov. George Deukmejian at his side, Bush
apparently forgot that Reagan had been a two-term governor of the
state. Referring to Deukmejian, Bush said, ``He will go down in my
book as THE great governor'' of California.
   In San Francisco, Bush tried to poke holes in Michael Dukakis'
boasts about the economy in Massachusetts. Inadvertently, he gave
Dukakis some campaign ammunition by incorrectly stating the record.
   His speech text said that Massachusetts, under Dukakis, had lost
26,000 manufacturing jobs and was ``one of the biggest
manufacturing job losers in America.'' But that's not the way Bush
said it.
   Reading from a device that scrolled his speech in front of his
eyes, Bush dropped the word ``manufacturing'' in two separate
references. Dukakis' staff pounced on Bush because although the
state has lost manufacturing jobs, it has added about 230,000 jobs
overall.
   Over breakfast at a Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles, Bush made
three gaffes in a matter of minutes.
   He said his Mexican-born daughter-in-law ``became a citizen so
she could vote for her grandfather ... her, uh, father-in-law.''
   He referred to Republican Rep. Manuel Lujan as a congressman
from Mexico _ not New Mexico. And he referred to the oldtime
``Dragnet'' television series character Joe Friday as ``senator''
before he corrected it to ``sergeant.''
   Bush said last week that when he makes a mistake, he's fair game
for attack by Dukakis _ and vice versa.
   ``We'll foul up and he'll jump on me, and he'll make some
mistakes and I'll jump on him, but the thing is to get the issues
out there so the American people can see them.
   ``Once in a while you do get sore; once in a while you might get
a little tense, but you know when you make a mistake like that, I
expect somebody to jump on me. Bob Hope did it. It didn't bother
me. Johnny Carson did it and that didn't bother me.''
   Bush also acknowledged that some staff members didn't want him
to meet with reporters, one reason being his occasional gaffes.
   ``It's just some lower level hand-wringers who think I'm going
to screw up,'' he said.

   From the turret of an Abrams tank in Michigan
to a union hall in Republican Orange County, Calif., Michael
Dukakis fought all last week to regain the initiative in the
presidential race.
   ``It was really a good week,'' he told reporters on the long
flight Saturday night from California to the nation's capital.
   A good week had been a long time coming.
   Aides to the Democratic presidential candidate readily conceded
the race had changed dramatically during the past month, with
George Bush enjoying a surge.
   Gone were those double-digit leads Dukakis once held in national
polls. Gone also was the sense some had had that he was a near
certain bet to win back the White House for the Democrats.
   Presidential campaigns can turn on which candidate is more
successful at setting the issues agenda and defining the public
perception of the contenders.
   For the past month, voters have learned more about Dukakis from
Republican Bush and his allies than they did from the Democratic
candidate.
   They have received a picture of a Northeast liberal who vetoed
legislation to require recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in
public schools, of a governor who supported allowing convicts to
have weekend furloughs from prison, of someone who opposed most
major weapons systems.
   The past week, Dukakis set out to alter that image, to ``sharpen
the message,'' as his aides put it.
   He sought to counter the charge that he is weak on defense by
riding in the turret of a tank and by delivering a speech decidedly
hawkish _ for Dukakis _ in tone.
   The emphasis in his speech at Georgetown University was on the
weapons systems he favors _ the Trident II, the Stealth bomber, a
new fighter and a new attack submarine.
   Then he flew to California where the emphasis was on fighting
crime and drugs as well as on the environment.
   His speeches contained more specifics _ doubling the number of
drug enforcement agents and elevating the Environmental Protection
Agency to Cabinet status.
   It was clear the Dukakis campaign had decided it was time to
make clear what he stands for.
   ``In most of the country, voters don't know who Mike Dukakis
is,'' said Francis O'Brien, a senior campaign adviser.
   No one summed that up better than George Bush, the week before
the Republican National Convention, when he dubbed Dukakis the
``Stealth candidate,'' a reference to the experimental plane
designed to evade radar detection.
   It was a jibe at a candidate who had avoided laying out specific
proposals on many major questions and had directed his party to
come up with a non-specific platform.
   For those who saw Democrats unduly burdened by past promises to
a variety of interest groups, Dukakis' strategy seemed right.
   But as the fall campaign opened it gave the Republicans an
opportunity to be the first to give voters a picture of Dukakis.
   Suddenly, the talk within the Dukakis campaign was of the need
for ``a good solid message.''
   ``It would have been better had he spoken up a little more
sharply, a little sooner,'' said Tony Podesta, who is running the
Dukakis campaign in California.
   The Republican attacks were relentless and at most stops Dukakis
found himself pressed to respond. He often resisted, reluctant to
get into extended negative campaigning.
   But he couldn't remain silent.
   ``We can't let them, we can't let Bush and his aides lay charges
on us that we don't answer,'' said O'Brien.
   While he sometimes appeared reluctant to respond to the vice
president, Dukakis was not shy about going on the attack.
   He repeatedly linked Bush to Manuel Noriega, whom Dukakis always
describes as the ``drug-peddling Panamanian dictator'' and said the
vice president had provided ``zero protection for the environment.''
   Dukakis' sense that he was having a good week was helped by the
reports of rhetorical gaffes by Bush and his running mate, Dan
Quayle.
   ``Dan Quayle doesn't know what century he's in and George Bush
can't remember the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he told a delighted
partisan crowd in California.

<HEAD>Omnibus Spending Bill Is Possible, Despite Last Winter's Pledges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Remember President Reagan's nationally
televised pledge last January to veto future catchall spending
bills like the $600 billion behemoth Congress sent him last year,
and the promises by scores of lawmakers from both parties not to do
it again?
   Guess what may be about to happen.
   As the Oct. 1 start of the 1989 fiscal year approaches,
increasing numbers of senators and representatives, and their
aides, concede that an omnibus spending bill looms as a real
possibility.
   It wouldn't be as large as last year's. After all, two of the 13
individual appropriations bills that finance the government have
already been signed into law, and four others have been sent to
Reagan for his signature.
   But with the presidential campaign influencing much of what
happens in Washington these days, and with the hopper stuffed with
legislation Congress wants to pass before leaving town next month,
a catchall spending bill may well be the result.
   ``I don't see any way out of that scenario right now,'' Sen. Ted
Stevens of Alaska, a ranking Republican on the Appropriations
Committee, said recently.
   Everyone agrees that come Oct. 1, a short-term omnibus bill is
virtually unavoidable, providing financing for a week or two for
all agencies for which money has not yet been provided for the new
fiscal year.
   But if spending legislation is not finished by the time Congress
adjourns in mid-October, lawmakers would likely either pass another
omnibus bill to tide the government over until Congress returns in
January, or send the president a package of all remaining
appropriations bills and dare him to veto it.
   The engine that would drive such a measure would be defense.
Reagan has already vetoed a Pentagon budget bill containing arms
control language and cuts in the ``Star Wars'' missile defense
system, a rejection that was interpreted as an effort to make
defense an issue in the presidential campaign.
   Many lawmakers still support those provisions. If Congress and
the White House cannot work out a compromise _ or if they send a
measure to Reagan and he vetoes it again _ a catchall bill would be
born, consisting of the defense spending bill and other unsigned
measures.
   ``There could be a situation, if we run into a problem on the
defense appropriations bill, in which there would have to be a
continuing resolution in the final analysis,'' Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., using the congressional term for
catchall spending legislation, warned his colleagues two weeks ago.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a member of both the House Budget and
Appropriations Committees, said Reagan ``thinks he's created an
issue ... They may figure they can rekindle it by vetoing an
appropriations bill.''
   Some Democrats say one scenario would be to send the president a
package of bills containing the defense legislation and other
spending measures, thus making it painful for the president to
exercise a veto and eliminating another opportunity for Republicans
to raise the defense issue.
   ``He threw us a curve by vetoing that defense bill,'' said Rep.
Les AuCoin, D-Ore., a member of the defense appropriations
subcommittee. ``No one down Pennsylvania Avenue should be surprised
if we use every strategy in the book to launch that curve out of
the ballpark.''
   However, Congress' Democratic leadership has vowed repeatedly
this year to try to send Reagan 13 separate spending bills by the
Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.
   Few lawmakers have forgotten the president's State of the Union
address of Jan. 25, when he hoisted thick stacks of spending and
tax bills that were months overdue and said, ``Congress shouldn't
send another one of these. And if you do, I will not sign it.''
   Reagan accused lawmakers of trying to force him to accept
excessive spending, while Congress blamed the president for being
so intractable for so long that lawmakers had no other choice.
Nonetheless, dozens of senators and representatives signed letters
chastising the use of omnibus spending bills, a belief that many
retain.
   ``They make Congress as an institution look bad,'' says Rep.
Timothy Penny, D-Minn., a perennial opponent of omnibus spending
measures.
   For his part, the president is standing firm on his words of
last January.
   ``I hope Congress will watch my lips here: I want 13 separate
bills,'' he said Friday.
   Whatever happens, that Congress has gotten even this far is a
remarkable feat for an institution that is a notorious budget
laggard.
   The House passed all 13 appropriations bills this year before
July 1, the first time that had happened since 1960. Congress
hasn't approved all 13 appropriations bills separately since fiscal
1977.

<TEXT>
   Barry Goldwater says he's enjoying the quiet
life in retirement, sitting in the Arizona sun and watching the
robins on his windowsill. But his mind, of late, has been back in
Washington, reliving past battles on the Potomac.
   What he remembers isn't at all flattering to those who served
with him, and what he sees for the future isn't always reassuring.
Barry Goldwater, as always, is still speaking bluntly.
   At age 79, Goldwater has written another book, reflecting on his
30-year career as a United States senator, his 1964 Republican
presidential bid, and the people and events he encountered along
the way. ``Goldwater,'' written with Jack Casserly, will be
published by Doubleday on Oct. 12.
   ``Nostalgia for the old days and other times rises like the sun
most of my mornings,'' Goldwater says. ``But in the evening, when
the cool desert air refreshes my spirit, my blood flows faster and
I shake my fist at the present.''
   Considering his outspoken words, Goldwater must have written
most of his book in the evening, with his blood flowing. Neither
Democrats nor Republicans are spared:
   PRESIDENT REAGAN: ``I believe Reagan did know of the diversion
of Iranian funds to the Contras. He had to know. The White House
explanation makes him out to be either a liar or incompetent.''
   SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER BOB DOLE: ``Dole doesn't have the
leadership qualities that his job as minority leader requires. He
tries to make everybody happy. That can't be done. I and other
Republicans were unable to harden his hide. The Kansas senator must
become tough if he is ever to become a leader.''
   SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADER ROBERT BYRD: ``One day I see Bob Byrd
on the Senate floor and didn't recognize him. His face was covered
with pancake makeup that ran down his starched collar. His hair was
stylishly fluffed. He looked like he was about to step on stage in
some nightclub act. I took one look, walked back to my seat, sat
down and waited for him to pull out his fiddle.''
   PRESIDENT NIXON: ``Richard Nixon was the most dishonest
individual I have ever met in my life. He lied to his wife, his
family, his friends, his colleagues in the Congress, lifetime
members of his own political party, the American people, and the
world.''
   Election junkies will be disappointed if they expect similar
observations on the candidates in this year's presidential
election. Fellow senators Lloyd Bentson and Dan Quayle, the
Democratic and Republican vice presidential nominees, are not
discussed at all. The name George Bush appears one, fleeting time,
Michael Dukakis not at all.
   Goldwater, however, has something to say about the Democratic
and Republican parties as they head into the November elections.
   _DEMOCRATS are ``rethinking the fundamental meaning of
liberalism and simply have no new direction or programs to use in
redirecting their energies.'' Looking beyond 1988, ``the Democrats
will come back strong about the year 2000 or shortly thereafter.
But it will be a new Democratic Party largely because of Reagan.''
   _REPUBLICANS ``don't have to become more centrist, but it's
certain the GOP has to accommodate and balance a wider variety of
opinions and political options. We must become more a party of
inclusion.''
   Referring to the New Right and its moral agenda, Goldwater said,
``We began walking separate roads, however, when the New Right
began pushing special social agendas involving legitimate legal,
religious and other differences. I support much of what they say,
but not at the risk of compromising constitutional rights.''
   Despite criticism of the Iran-Contra scandal and Reagan's
choices of Adm. John Poindexter as national security adviser and
Donald Regan to be his White House chief of staff, Goldwater calls
Reagan ``the most inspirational president I have seen,'' edging out
John F. Kennedy, who ``inspired the nation.''
   Goldwater is less inspired by the growing federal and
congressional bureaucracies. ``The colossus we continue to
construct in Washington is now being threatened from within,'' he
says. ``The large staffs created to help Congress are now beginning
to control it. I've long asked the question: Who the hell is
running Congress, we or the staffs?''
   While Goldwater is optimistic that the world will solve problems
of population, hunger and disease, he says communism ``is the
world's greatest danger'' and ``the seeds of future global conflict
have unmistakably already been sown. A Third World War is not
unthinkable.''
   For 51 of his nearly 80 years, Barry Goldwater drew support from
his wife, Peggy, who died in 1985, and he remembers her with pain
and poignancy in the book dedicated, simply, ``To Peggy.''
   After her death, ``I phoned her four or five times every day for
months after returning to Washington. The phone would ring and
ring. Then her memory would fall away and my face would collapse
into my hands. The healing process has been slow and painful.''
   If the title hadn't already been taken for a book about Harry
Truman, Goldwater could have called his book ``Plain Speaking.'' As
he says at the beginning, ``these recollections are straight from
the shoulder _ a last salute before the flag is lowered and the
final notes of taps fade into memory. A man stands up, says his
piece, then sits down. Others must judge his deeds.''

   Nearly three out of four juveniles in youth
correctional facilities come from broken homes and nearly half were
under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they committed their
offense, a government study reported Sunday.
   The study found that nearly 60 percent of the 18,226 juveniles
in the long-term, state-operated institutions during 1987 used
drugs regularly, once a week or more for at least a month.
   Seventy-two percent of the boys and girls under 18 said they had
not grown up with both parents. About half of all the juveniles
surveyed said they had lived primarily with their mothers.
   More than half of the juveniles reported that a family member
had also been imprisoned at least once.
   The report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a Justice
Department agency, was based on interviews with a nationally
representative sample of 2,621 residents of 50 youth correctional
institutions administered by 26 states.
   ``The study found that many of the juvenile offenders had
criminal histories that were just as extensive as those of adults
in state prisons,'' said Steven R. Schlesinger, director of the
bureau.
   About 39 percent of the juveniles had been incarcerated for
violent crimes, and nearly 43 percent had been arrested more than
five times.
   More than 16 percent of the juveniles were institutionalized for
an assault, 13 percent for robbery and 6 percent for a rape or
other sexual assault.
   Twenty-three percent said they were under the influence of both
drugs and alcohol at the time they committed the offense that led
to their incarceration.
   According to the survey, 15.7 percent said they were under the
influence of only drugs at the time of the offense, and 8.7 percent
of alcohol only.
   More than 93 percent of the juveniles were male, and 52.5
percent were white, 41.4 percent were black and 6.1 percent were
American Indians, Asians, Alaskan natives or Pacific Islanders. An
estimated 14.5 percent were of Hispanic background.

   Eight boxes of correspondence and memos
from the Peoples Temple commune at Jonestown, Guyana, where 913
people died in a mass suicide 10 years ago, have become available
for scholarly review.
   Among the documents are dozens of scribbled notes from members
suggesting methods of taking revenge on people who defected from
the group, proposals that included selling them poisoned Christmas
candy.
   The records, unsealed by a court-appointed receiver and
deposited recently at the California Historical Society in San
Francisco, reveal the bizarre mental states of members of the
Peoples Temple.
   In a group of letters to the Rev. Jim Jones, leader of the
religious cult and mastermind of the suicide on Nov. 18, 1978, some
members vowed to kill themselves and their children on command.
   Jones' aides wrote memos to him on how sleep deprivation and
Vitamin B complex deficiency are useful tools in brainwashing.
   After a ``suicide drill'' at the jungle settlement, one member
wrote to Jones:
   ``Sex, drugs, nor wine could take what took place this evening.
I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to go through the
process of dying. Just sitting there looking at the line of people,
young and old alike, eager to get it over with. I thought of how
nice it would be.''
   Most members of the commune swallowed grape drink laced with
potassium cyanide a short time after Rep. Leo Ryan, a San Francisco
Examiner photographer, two NBC reporters and a temple defector were
killed by supporters of Jones in a hail of gunfire at the commune's
air strip.
   Poison was squirted down the throats of children.
   The new documents also reveal that Jones' wife, Marceline,
challenged him during the summer of 1978. When talk of mass suicide
became a temple obsession, she pleaded with him in a letter to
spare the children.
   One woman said she would kill herself if Jones, whom she called
``Father,'' wanted it.
   But she added that she still wanted to ``write some short
stories, even poetry ... plant rows of vegetables. And I would like
to raise a kitten.''

   A majority of Americans favor financial
assistance for family planning programs in rapidly growing nations,
according to a new poll done for a pair of population groups.
   Sixty percent of adults polled by Louis Harris and Associates
said the United States should fund foreign family planning
programs, regardless of whether abortion is legal in those nations.
   But more than one-third of Americans, 34 percent, disagreed,
according to the poll prepared for the Population Crisis Committee
and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
   Providing financial support for family planning has been a bone
of contention in recent years, with the Agency for International
Development withdrawing support from countries where abortion is a
part of the programs.
   The agency halted funding to both the International Planned
Parenthood Federation and the United Nation's Population Fund,
contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion.
   The two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1,250
Americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this
presidential election year. A poll of that size has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The study concluded that Americans are aware that the world's
population _ which last year topped the 5 billion mark _ is growing
rapidly and that this poses many problems.
   Some 91 percent of those polled think food shortages and famines
will get worse if populations in poor countries continue their
rapid increases, the study found.
   Continued population growth will lead to more illegal
immigration to the United States, according to 89 percent of the
respondents, while 87 percent predicted that there will be more
international crises and that more agricultural land will turn to
desert and 69 percent foresee more U.S. jobs moving overseas.
   Asked if the poor countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia
should have strong birth control programs, 89 percent agreed.
Fifty-nine percent said such programs are in the United States'
interest, and 60 percent approved U.S. money for the programs.

   Nearly four years after radon from his
house caused Stanley Watras to set off radiation detectors at the
Limerick nuclear power plant, he wonders daily about his family's
health.
   ``There's a fine line between making yourself sick by worrying
and having a genuine concern and doing the best you can,'' said
Watras, 37, a technical adviser at the plant.
   Radon levels in Watras' home of 800 times the concentration
deemed hazardous first alerted environmental officials and
residents of southeastern Pennsylvania to the danger of indoor
radon concentration. Last week, the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency said the problem is more widespread than
previously believed and urged that every home in the country be
tested.
   Radon is a radioactive gas produced by the natural decaying of
uranium found in all soil and rock and usually dissipated
harmlessly into the atmosphere. It poses a health threat when it
seeps through the ground and collects in homes.
   The colorless, odorless gas could be responsible for 20,000 of
the nation's 130,000 annual lung cancer deaths, the EPA estimates.
It kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the lung,
irradiating the organs for a lifetime.
   Environmental officials first believed radon to be concentrated
along a geological formation known as the Reading Prong, a narrow
area of high-uranium soil stretching from Reading, Pa., across
northern New Jersey into New York state.
   But a recent EPA survey in seven states and Indian land found
health-threatening levels of radon in 29 percent of 11,000 homes
tested.
   The EPA has set 4 picocuries of radon per liter of air as a
guideline for determining when long-term exposure poses a health
threat. A picocurie is a measure of radiation. Exposure to 15
picocuries of radon for a lifetime is equivalent to smoking a pack
of cigarettes a day, the EPA says.
   A reading taken in the living room of Watras' modest,
split-level house in December 1984 was 3,200 picocuries, the
highest ever recorded at a private home. Watras, his wife and two
young children were evacuated soon afterward.
   Tim Hartman, administrator of the state Radon Monitoring Program
set up several miles away in late 1985, said the Watrases' house
was built inches above uranium-laden granite.
   ``He just had an ungodly concentration of radon spewing into his
home,'' Hartman said.
   Watras and his family returned to the house in August 1985 after
a $32,600 research project dramatically reduced the radon level.
Watras and his wife have since had a third child.
   ``At the beginning, we were saying, `Why us?' We were looking at
the children saying, `What did we do to you?''' Watras recalled in
an interview at his home last week.
   Watras now believes God put his family in the home for a purpose.
   ``What we've got to do from now on is try to help other
people,'' he said, calling his efforts to bring attention to radon
``a crusade.''
   Some of the other residents in his suburban Berks County
neighborhood, nicknamed Radon Hills, agree with him and have
organized to push for legislation protecting homes from the toxic
gas. Others believe the threat is overblown.
   Kay Jones, who lives down the street from Watras, is president
of Pennsylvanians Against Radon, a group with about 150 members.
   Ms. Jones believes national building codes should include radon
guidelines, wants public service advertisements that warn people
about the danger of radon and supports a law that would force a
family to leave a home when radon levels reach a certain point.
   Unless the government acts, people will forget about radon as
media interest wanes, she said.
   ``Right now, everything you pick up, it's radon, radon, radon,
but in two or three days it's going to die out,'' Ms. Jones said.
   Dennis Hess, another neighbor, is one of those skeptical about
the radon threat.
   ``I don't think I'm walking into a gas chamber when I walk into
my home. I'd like to think something else will get me before the
radon,'' said Hess, a 34-year-old machinist at a chemical plant.
   Hess hasn't measured the radon level in his home, and he said
environmental officials haven't been able to convince him that the
problem can't be alleviated by opening a few windows.
   No records exist of the number of people who have had their
homes refitted in Pennsylvania to reduce the amount of radon in the
air. Hartman estimated the number was in the thousands, most of
them along the Reading Prong, where 60 percent of the homes tested
had levels above 4 picocuries.
   Even when houses have been fixed, health worries remain.
   ``The fear never goes away,'' said Ms. Jones, whose family spent
five years in a home that recorded a radon level of 450 picocuries
before being fitted with a ventilation system. ``We're living in
the unknown.''

   Sen. William Proxmire awarded his latest
Golden Fleece award to the Urban Mass Transit Administration for
sending government officials to Disney World to learn how to
motivate employees, his office said Sunday.
   The September installment of the Wisconsin Democrat's monthly
award for wasteful federal spending was for a four-day seminar that
cost the agency $68,160.
   ``UMTA apparently hopes that by sending mass transit officials
from around the country to Disney World, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs will help them find out how to make
transit employees whistle while they work,'' Proxmire said in a
written statement.
   Attending the Sept. 6-9 session in Orlando, Fla., were six top
UMTA officials _ including its chief, Alfred A. DelliBovi _ and 47
local mass transit officials from around the country. The officials
paid their own travel expenses, but UMTA picked up the tab for the
$110 per night hotel rooms and the $795 program fee for each.
   ``This is an idea Dopey would have loved, but it's likely to
make taxpayers feel like Grumpy,'' the senator said.
   UMTA spokesman James Bynum said Friday that agency officials are
worried that only 2.8 per cent of all travel by Americans is made
on mass transit, the lowest percentage since the government began
making the estimate 20 years ago.
   Bynum said the trip served two purposes: To allow officials to
learn how Disney World officials motivate their workers and to
examine the amusement park's huge transportation system. Both would
provide helpful lessons for agencies trying to boost ridership, he
said.
   ``It was a perfectly legitimate effort to convince public
transit authorities that there are ways to attract new riders,''
Bynum said. ``Government would do well to draw on the experience of
successful private companies.''
   The seminar, called ``The Disney Approach to People
Management,'' was also attended by executives from private
industry, Bynum said.
   Proxmire, however, said he doubted that allowing government
officials to ``frolic in the Magic Kingdom with federal dollars''
would prove helpful.
   ``Instead of a trip to Disney World, maybe mass transit
officials can improve employee morale by wearing Mickey Mouse ears
around bus yards,'' he said. ``It would cost far less, and it would
probably accomplish as much as this wasteful trip.''

   The new Miss America, Gretchen Carlson,
says her lightning-fast break with normal life was extremely
difficult and left her with mixed emotions about winning the title.
   ``I was devastated by the quick goodbye I had with my parents in
my hotel room in Atlantic City,'' she said. ``Suddenly my whole
support system was torn away from me.''
   The Anoka woman, a student on leave from Stanford University,
has just finished the first week of her reign, and there's no letup
in sight. A quick welcome-home trip is scheduled early in October,
a 10-day break at Christmas, and one day off at Easter. That's it.
   But there is glamour, of course.
   Miss Carlson has visited Donald Trump and his $30 million yacht,
the Trump Princess, and stayed for five days at one of New York's
most elegant hotels, Maxim's, owned by Pierre Cardin.
   Still, she recalls the morning after she was named Miss America:
``I looked in the mirror the next day. I said to myself, `You did
it. Now you have to figure out if you're glad you did it.'''

   The prime minister's office once planted a false
story that Prince Charles would marry Princess Marie-Astrid of
Luxembourg to catch a senior political source leaking information
to the press, a new book says.
   The false information was leaked 11 years ago with the
connivance of Special Branch, the arm of Scotland Yard that handles
political security, and with the assent of Charles' parents, Queen
Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, according to ``The Real Charles,''
to be published Monday.
   Author Alan Hamilton, a senior journalist at The Times of
London, said the source had upset the prime minister's office and
Buckingham Palace by feeding ``a stream of high-grade, accurate
political gossip'' to John Warden, then political editor of the
Daily Express.
   The suspected source was fed an inaccurate ``but just about
plausible'' account that Charles would marry Marie-Astrid, a Roman
Catholic, the book says. In fact, the two scarcely knew each other.
   The planted story claimed that any sons of the marriage would be
raised as Anglicans, but that daughters would be brought up as
Catholics, Hamilton says. The British monarch is head of the state
Church of England and by law, Roman Catholics are barred from
succeeding to the throne.
   The story appeared on the front page of the Express under the
headline ``Charles To Marry Astrid _ Official.''
   The source was then confronted, confessed his guilt and
discreetly retired, Hamilton says.
   The Sunday Telegraph quoted Warden as denying a trap was set. It
quoted him as saying his information for the story came from a
politician with extremely good royal connections who had correctly
tipped him the previous year that Princess Margaret, the queen's
sister, would get a divorce.

   TV talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey says she will
soon make a dream come true by becoming the first black to own a
major television and film production studio.
   Ms. Winfrey, who recently acquired ownership of her nationally
syndicated talk show, is leading a small group of investors in
purchasing an 88,000-square-foot TV and film production facility on
Chicago's Near West Side.
   Ms. Winfrey said she had been dreaming of owning her own studio
ever since she saw director Steven Spielberg's Amblin film studio
while auditioning for a role in his film ``The Color Purple'' three
years ago.
   ``I thought, `One day I want to own a place like this,''' Ms.
Winfrey said. ``It was a dream of mine ... but I did not know it
would happen this fast.''
   An announcement released Saturday by Ms. Winfrey's production
company, Harpo Productions Inc., said acquisition makes her ``the
first black individual in history to own a TV and film production
complex.''
   The 30-year-old Fred Niles Studios, which four years ago became
Studio Network Inc., will be renamed Harpo Studios once the deal is
closed, expected in a few days. No purchase price was given, but
the investors say the total cost of acquiring, renovating and
equipping the facility will be more than $10 million.
   Ms. Winfrey can easily afford to invest in the film complex. The
Oct. 3 issue of Forbes magazine estimated her 1987-88 earnings at
$37 million.

<HEAD>CNN Courts Hispanic Audience With Spanish Broadcast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
addresses Hispanic voters in their own language, Cables News
Network can broadcast his words untranslated on its new
Spanish-language program.
   The language spoken by one-eighth of the U.S. population has
become part of the daily newsroom hum at the Headline News studios
in Atlanta, as CNN enters its fourth month of producing ``Noticiero
Telemundo-CNN.''
   ``It's a very ambitious undertaking for CNN to have gotten
into,'' said the program's executive producer, Marlene May. ``And
they're going full steam ahead. It's sort of like the sky's the
limit right now.''
   The twice-daily, half-hour newscast premiered in May with
on-scene coverage of the Moscow summit.
   It is the first time a major Enlish-language news organization
has entered the growing Spanish-language television market.
   But CNN's Spanish product is shown in this country on 18
Spanish-language stations owned by or affiliated with Telemundo
Group Inc., a Spanish network based in New York.
   CNN also sold the program in eight Latin American countries.
   Its main competitor is the newscast produced by Univision
Holdings Inc., a Spanish-language broadcast system that has been
around for some 25 years.
   The 25-member bilingual staff shares CNN's Headline News studio
in Atlanta and has access to the cable networks' English-language
news gathering resources worldwide.
   ``The resources of 1,600 CNN employees around the world are
available for them to use in Spanish if they choose,'' said Steve
Hayworth, spokesman for the Atlanta-based CNN.
   However, May stresses that the newscast is not just a
translation of CNN's English product.
   ``We've hired our own journalists _ everything from editors to
writers to anchors to reporters,'' she said. ``There's not a
translator on my staff.''
   Numbering more than 20 million, Hispanic Americans have become
the fastest growing minority market in the country. Among the half
who understand English, more than 50 percent still spend most of
their time watching Spanish-language television, according to a
survey cited in the trade journal Television-Radio Age.
   Advertisers spent $223 million on Spanish-language television
last year, up 23 percent from 1986 and nearly double the $118
million spent in 1984, the journal reported.
   ``There is obviously an important and large and affluent
marketplace of Spanish-speaking Americans,'' Hayworth said.
   Though CNN hasn't been on the air very long in Spanish, May said
she's pleased with the results of its first summer.
   ``We're ecstatic about the fact that we've kept up our audience
share and ratings in New York,'' she said, adding that the program
also has been doing well in Miami and Los Angeles, other cities
with large Hispanic populations.
   ``We try to do stories that we feel would really affect the
Hispanics ... most things related to health, children, education _
the dropout rate is a major problem among Hispanics,'' said May, a
native of Cuba.
   Jorge Gestoso, a co-anchor of the program, said it's important
for Hispanic journalists to see world events through the eyes of
their audience.
   ``When we covered the Republican National Convention, we tried
to focus on how what they were saying could affect the lives of
Hispanics,'' said Gestoso, who was born in Uruguay.
   ``It's vital, it's essential to have Spanish language news. The
audience is very different _ at least a portion of them speak only
Spanish or very little English,'' he said. ``There's a vital need
to let them understand what's going on in the world.''

<HEAD>Congress Considers Raising Minimum Wage This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When their party regained control of the
Senate two years ago, liberal Democrats placed at the top of their
agenda raising a minimum wage that President Reagan claimed had
``caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great
Depression.''
   With only seven weeks remaining until voters pick Reagan's
successor, his former running mate and GOP-designated heir, George
Bush, may have waffled just enough on the issue in the past two
weeks for Democrats to push through the first increase in the $3.35
an hour wage base in eight years.
   Labor Department figures indicate that a raise to $4.55 by 1991
as proposed by Senate Democrats would directly benefit some 15
million workers now paid less than that amount.
   Bush said again last Friday that he could support a modest
increase _ less than the $1.20 an hour over three years that
Democrats have agreed upon _ but only if it is coupled with a lower
``training wage.''
   Key Senate Republicans such as Pete Domenici of New Mexico
predicted that Bush's slight shift to muted support for a wage
increase will cause many GOP lawmakers to reconsider their
opposition with or without the training wage.
   The training wage is the latest Republican euphemism for a
subminimum wage, a Reagan idea that went nowhere when the
administration proposed it year after year during his first term
but that succeeded in taking the steam out of a push for an minimum
wage increase.
   To quote Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.,
paraphrasing Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight:
``There is nothing that a good defense cannot beat a better
offense. In other words, a good offense wins.''
   But with the Senate expected to complete action on the minimum
wage this week followed by House action the next week, Bush, Quayle
and congressional Republicans are stuck on defense.
   The latest Gallup Poll on the issue on June 19 showed 76 percent
public support for raising the minimum wage by 50 percent to $5.05
over the next four years, with only 28 percent opposition. Even
Republicans who were polled favored the raise by 67 percent to 30
percent.
   The raise to $5.05 over four years is the House Democratic
version of Massachusetts Democrat Edward M. Kennedy's increase to
$4.55 over three years in the Senate. House leaders already have
indicated they will abandon their proposal in favor of the Senate
version.
   As a Republican counter, Quayle _ who has led the Senate
opposition to a minimum wage increase the past 7{ years _ in July
offered a 65-cent raise over two years to $4 an hour, coupled with
a lower training wage.
   Republicans, however, declined to push for a vote on Quayle's
amendment in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee then,
saying they preferred to wage the battle on the Senate floor.
   While Bush and the Republican campaign have declined to specify
what they want in a minimum wage package, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn., said he will introduce Quayle's $4 minimum wage as an
amendment this week.
   And Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has a pending amendment on the
Senate floor to establish a ``training'' wage that would pay any
new hire 80 percent of the minimum wage for the first 90 days he or
she is on an employer's payroll.
   But because Democrats control the Senate, Hatch's proposal may
never get a direct vote. Kennedy offered a substitute that would
slightly expand coverage of an 85 percent subminimum wage _
currently $2.85 an hour _ for full-time students that is now in the
law. About 100,000 students are paid that subminimum.
   If Kennedy's parliamentary gambit works and a majority supports
his subminimum proposal, Republicans may be precluded from ever
getting a yea-or-nea vote on their training wage.
   Hatch expressed doubts last week that he would prevail. But with
many lawmakers in both parties taking last Friday off to campaign
for re-election, he succeeded in delaying any votes until at least
Tuesday when presumably all will have returned.
   Kennedy, meanwhile, welcomed Bush's vague support for any kind
of minimum wage increase.
   ``I only wish that he had spoken up sooner,'' Kennedy said,
returning to his ``Where was George?'' theme at the Democratic
National Convention. ``I must say that his silence has been
deafening during debate on this bill.''
   Meanwhile, the Senate is scheduled to vote Monday evening on a
U.S.-Canada trade agreement that would phase out all tariffs
between the two countries over 10 years.
   The House in August approved the agreement negotiated by the
Reagan administration. But its anticipated passage by the Senate
and then signature by the president does not mean that it will go
into effect soon.
   The bill authorizes Reagan to implement the agreement next Jan.
1. But it has been approved by only one of Canada's two legislative
bodies.
   If Canadian Prime Minister Brain Mulroney, as expected, calls
new parliamentary elections in the next two or three weeks,
legislation there implementing the accord could die in Canada's
Senate. A new parliament would then have to start from scratch on
enacting the agreement.

   Nineteen years after the grisly Manson Family
murders, the house where actress Sharon Tate and four others were
butchered is being offered for sale.
   The remote home overlooking Benedict Canyon, its
4,600-square-feet largely unchanged since the killings, is being
offered for a price of $1,999,000 by real estate agent Adam
Jakobson of Mike Glickman's Brentwood office.
   Despite the clouded past, Jakobson expects owner Rudolph
Altobelli will get his price.
   ``I don't anticipate any problems,'' Jakobson said, noting
Altobelli has already received two offers at $1.5 million. Right
after the slayings, he had 35 unsolicited offers for the place.
   Miss Tate, the pregnant wife of film director Roman Polanski,
coffee heiress Abigail Folger, hairstylist Jay Sebring, Miss
Folger's boyfriend Voityck Frykowski and Steven Parent, a friend of
the caretaker, were killed in August 1969 by followers of Charles
Manson.
   The five were found stabbed, shot and bludgeoned to death in the
home.
   Altobelli, who has owned the home since 1963, had rented the
house to Polanski.

<TEXT>
   A forest fire that swept out of Yellowstone
National Park threatened a fir tree inscribed by western showman
Buffalo Bill Cody, and his grandson feared the worst for his
namesake's landmark.
   But it survived even though trees 6 feet away were burned.
   ``You talk about a miracle. I'll say it was,'' Bill Cody said.
   The fir tree's 4-foot-thick trunk was inscribed ``Camp Monaco
1913'' when Buffalo Bill was host to Prince Albert of Monaco on a
hunting trip in the Shoshone National Forest. Cody's famous Wild
West show was a hit in Europe.
   ``It was about this time of year when Granddad took the prince
up there,'' Cody said.
   He had been worried about the tree ever since the Clover-Mist
fire surged into the North Fork drainage about two weeks ago, but a
helicopter flight over the area with U.S. Forest Service rangers
confirmed the tree was safe.
   Camp Monaco is a half day's horseback ride from Pahaska Tepee,
Buffalo Bill's hunting lodge near Yellowstone's east entrance.
   Cody said he had been considering attempting to salvage the
inscription if the tree burned, but he started to fear the worst
when he saw from the air how much damage the fire had caused.
   ``It was a disaster all the way up the North Fork. On both sides
of the river there was nothing but burn, burn, burn,'' he said.
   But when the helicopter approached a meadow near Camp Monaco,
Cody spotted a clump of green amid hundred of acres of black.
   ``It looked just like a pinpoint in the middle of a pie,'' he
said.``When I saw the tree was saved I let out a yell. There were
burned trees within 6 feet of it, and a bottle lying about 6 feet
away was scorched.''

<HEAD>Bush, Dukakis Home for a Day, One Week Before Big Debate</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 4th graf, Meanwhile; Mitchell is not whip</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   One week before their high-stakes debate, George Bush and
Michael Dukakis took Sunday off before heading into a week of
reduced campaigning amid intense preparation for their first
televised confrontation before a national audience.
   Bush, in brief remarks to reporters in Washington, said he'd
``done all the homework'' for the debate but still planned to work
later in the week on preparing for it.
   Dukakis, who was out of the public eye in Boston, also planned
to ease off on his recently full-speed campaign travels later in
the week to concentrate on getting ready for the debate.
   Meanwhile, Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, a top-ranking Senate
Democrat, defended the party's nominee against recent attacks by
Bush and other Republicans.
   In particular, Mitchell took the Republicans to task for their
criticism of Dukakis' veto of Massachusetts legislation that would
have required teachers to lead classes in the Pledge of Allegiance.
   ``There is no greater phony issue that's been raised in this
campaign,'' Mitchell said on ABC's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.'' He said, ``In America, the pledge means something
because we say it freely. ... We are not forced to do so.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois, a co-chairwoman of the national
Bush campaign, criticized Mitchell for linking the issue to loyalty
oaths in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. She said such comments
show why the issue ``is working against Michael Dukakis and
should.''
   As for next Sunday's debate in Winston-Salem, N.C., the first of
two presidential confrontations before the Nov. 8 election, Bush
said, ``I think I've done the homework. It's like a ballgame,
getting up for it, mentally up and physically up.''
   The vice president, speaking with reporters after attending
church services, said he planned to work this week on preparing for
the debate ``but not today. It's Sunday, a day off. I'm going to
get a little exercise and count my blessings.''
   Monday morning campaign appearances in the Philadelphia area, a
Tuesday visit to a flag manufacturing company in New Jersey and a
joint appearance with President Reagan on Thursday in Texas were
Bush's only scheduled trips for the week.
   The vice president said he didn't expect to visit areas in
southern Texas damaged by Hurricane Gilbert. He said of the
hurricane, ``It's a sad thing. Fortunately, it was less strong when
it hit. But still there is a lot of heartache.''
   Dukakis, who spent most of last week on the road, giving major
speeches on foreign and military policy, also planned to
concentrate on getting ready for the debate during the coming week.
   Still, the Massachusetts governor, who returned home only
Saturday night, was to embark on a campaign trip to Texas on Monday.
   The vice presidential running mates, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle, also were off the campaign trail on Sunday.
   Bush, who attended services at St. John's Church, an Episcopal
church on Lafayette Square across from the White House, with his
wife, Barbara, answered several questions afterward.
   Asked about the military coup in Haiti, he said, ``It's too
early to say what happened.'' But he added, ``We want democracy for
Haiti, for the whole of the Caribbean and for the whole of Central
America.''
   He said such a trend appears to be occurring in Latin America
``with some visible exceptions.''
   Asked if he favored a resumption of talks with Panama's leader
Gen. Manuel Noriega, Bush would say only, ``We want democracy in
Panama'' as well as through the rest of the region.
   On another television talk program, Lee M. Thomas, administrator
of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Bush had asked him on
two occasions if more could be done to fight acid rain than was
called for by Reagan administration policies.
   Thomas, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said, ``At least twice,
individually with me, he pulled me aside on the issue of acid rain
and asked if we could do more _ and frankly at that point in time,
I didn't think we should _ than where we were going on that
problem.'' He did not say when the inquiries occurred.
   In the campaign, Bush has said, ``I am an environmentalist,''
and has said there were many occasions when he argued within the
councils of the administration for more environmental protection.
He says he will back a program to reduce emissions of one major raw
material for acid rain, sulfur dioxide from smokestacks, by
unspecified millions of tons.
   Thomas has supported the administration's position that not
enough is known about the effects of acid rain to justify a major
emissions reduction program, and that more research is needed.
   Dukakis on Saturday said he would elevate EPA to the status of a
Cabinet department.
   Meanwhile, a new poll suggested Bush has overtaken Dukakis in
Ohio, a key state in which Dukakis had once led by 10 percentage
points.
   The University of Akron poll, commissioned by The (Akron) Beacon
Journal, WKYC-TV in Cleveland and WCMH-TV in Columbus, indicated
that 43 percent of the registered voters checked in the survey
favored Bush to 39 percent for Dukakis and 18 percent undecided.
Bush's lead was within the poll's margin of potential sampling
error _ four points in either direction.
   The poll was conducted by telephone among 667 registered voters
between Sept. 6 and last Thursday.

<HEAD>Automobile Heir, Museum Benefactor Dies In Norfolk At Age 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter P. Chrysler Jr., an art collector and
museum benefactor whose father founded Chrysler Corp., has died of
cancer at the age of 79.
   Chrysler, who died Saturday at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital,
divided his time between New York City and Norfolk, hometown of his
wife, Jean. He had devoted much of his life to building a
multimillion-dollar art collection that is housed at the Chrysler
Museum in Norfolk.
   ``The Chrysler Museum and the commonwealth have lost a great
friend and patron,'' museum director David Steadman said Sunday.
``Mr. Chrysler was a rare collector whose encyclopedic interests
distinguished him from others.''
   He purchased his first work of art, a Renoir, for $350 at age
14. But the painting, a landscape with an inch-high nude, drew the
disapproval of a teacher at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut,
where Chrysler was a student.
   ``The corridor master thought it unbecoming for young men to
have such paintings,'' Chrysler said in a 1980 interview. ``So he
busted it over his knee and threw it in the trash can.''
   Later at Dartmouth University, Chrysler founded an arts magazine
with another student, senior Nelson Rockefeller.
   He went against trends, buying paintings by as-yet unrecognized
artists. In the 1970s, he sold a Picasso for $1.6 million that he
had bought 30 years earlier for $450.
   The first Chrysler Museum was in Provincetown, Mass. In 1970,
Chrysler agreed to move the collection to Norfolk after the city
offered to rename its museum for him and add a wing, as well as
naming a concert hall at Scope for him.
   Since then, the collection has grown in size, value and
reputation. It was called one of the top 20 in the country by the
Wall Street Journal and has an 8,000-piece glass collection, one of
the finest in the world.
   In addition to his art collecting, in 1934 Chrysler founded the
Air-Temp division of Chrysler, which developed the first air
conditioning system on wheels.
   Chrysler is survived by several nieces and nephews.
   A memorial service will be held Tuesday at the Church of the
Good Shepherd in Norfolk. Burial will be Wednesday in the family
plot in Tarrytown, N.Y.

<HEAD>Crack-Addicted Parolee Charged in Pratt Student's Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A crack-addicted, paroled killer has been
charged with slaying a 24-year-old art student because she refused
to give him her pocketbook, police said. The robbery netted $27.
   Judith Ann Wrappe, a native of Little Rock, Ark., and a
first-year graduate student at Pratt Institute, had been in New
York just a week when she was shot to death early Wednesday, police
said.
   Saturday night, police arrested Frank DeChirico, 37, of
Brooklyn, and charged him with Miss Wrappe's murder, said Deputy
Inspector Charles Prestia.
   Detectives from the Brooklyn North homicide squad and
investigators from the state parole office were able to identify
DeChirico from information obtained from witnesses and street
sources, he said.
   DeChirico, arrested nine times since 1966 on charges including
robbery, drug possession, grand larceny and burglary, had been out
on parole since December 1986 after serving 13{ years for
manslaughter charge in a 1973 killing, police said.
   ``He is a local crack addict who spends a lot of time on the
street,'' Prestia said at a news conference. ``We believe the
robbery was for the purpose of getting money for drugs.''
   ``We were looking for him, spotted him and he was taken into
custody without incident,'' the police official said.
   DeChirico was charged with second-degree murder, robbery,
criminal possession of a dangerous weapon and criminal possession
of stolen property. Prestia said DeChirico was charged with the
weapons count even though the gun used in the killing has not been
found.
   The deputy inspector said DeChirico stole $27. Miss Wrappe's
purse contained $1 and other personal effects when found by police
the day after the killing.
   Miss Wrappe's mother, Sue Wrape, said her daughter, a 1987
graduate of Notre Dame, had moved to New York ``to pursue her
dream'' of becoming a successful artist.
   She was confronted by a robber as she was returning to her
Brooklyn dormitory from her waitress job about 1 a.m. Wednesday.
When she resisted, she was killed by a single bullet to the chest.
   ``It makes me feel better that he's off the street,'' Mrs.
Wrape, whose family spells the surname the traditional way, said in
a telephone interview from Little Rock.
   ``I'm sure the police and the judicial system will take care of
it from here, and we can count on justice being done.''
   Prestia said DeChirico made no statements after his arrest.
   A disheveled DeChirico, who was unable or unwilling to stand on
his own as he was taken from the precinct house by police, simply
said ``no'' when reporters asked him if he were guilty.
   His arrest came hours after hundreds mourned Miss Wrappe at a
requiem Mass in her hometown, and Bishop Andrew J. McDonald
remembered her as a gifted artist who ``marched to a different
drummer'' and ``was not afraid to be different.''
   She is survived by her parents, four brothers and a sister.

   Police swarmed through gang territories and
arrested more than 870 people to curb continuing violence that left
one dead and at least four wounded during the weekend, authorities
said Sunday.
   About 380 officers from 10 police divisions arrested more than
360 people Saturday night and early Sunday after bringing in more
than 510 people Friday night, police said.
   More than half of those arrested were suspected gang members,
police said. The arrests ranged from felony drug crimes to
misdemeanors.
   Police also wrote hundreds of traffic citations and confiscated
66 cars, eight guns, cocaine, marijuana, and $1,400 in cash, said
Sgt. Larry Mazur.
   Gang violence continued despite police efforts. One young man
was killed and another man was wounded Sunday morning in a drive-by
shooting in the San Fernando Valley community of Sun Valley, police
said.
   A single shotgun blast from a passing car killed the man and
wounded his companion, said Officer Robert Peterson. Their names
were withheld pending notification of relatives. A motive for the
attack was not known, but police called it gang-related.
   At about the same time, two gang members and one innocent
bystander were hit by shots fired from a passing car several blocks
away from Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Hospital officials refused
to release their conditions.
   Two reputed gang members were booked for investigation of
attempted murder in suburban Burbank on Friday night after opening
fire on a crowd at a hamburger stand, said Sgt. Rick Madrid.
   Officers who were watching the stand because of two other
drive-by shootings in the area in the past two weeks saw several
people limp away after the attack, but nobody reported an injury to
authorities, Madrid said.

<HEAD>Book: Reagan Strategists Worried He Lacked Issues in 1984 Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tape recording of a preliminary strategy
session for President Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign indicates
his advisers found that his administration lacked a platform to run
on, according to a new book.
   Reporters Jane Mayer of the Wall Street Journal and Doyle
McManus of the Los Angeles Times describe the session in
``Landslide,'' a book about Reagan's second term, published by
Houghton Mifflin Co.
   The authors do not say how they gained access to the tape
recording that they say was made of the four-hour confidential
meeting held in late June 1984 in a conference room at campaign
headquarters of Reagan and Vice President George Bush.
   They quote Stuart Spencer, the campaign's chief strategist, as
saying on the tapes, ``The problem is we've been talking to
everybody at the White House over the past few days _ and the
Reagan administration fired all its bullets very early and very
successfully in the first two years. All their plans, all their
priorities, all their programs. They've run out of ammunition.''
   ``The most striking thing I discovered is that they don't have a
goddamn thing in the pipeline,'' Spencer is quoted as saying.
``They've run out of ammunition.''
   Spencer, a longtime Reagan associate, is now an adviser to
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle.
   Pollster Robert Teeter, according to the book, agreed with
Spencer, saying, ``Days digging around, and we found nothing. This
is a national election. We've got to find something to say.''
   At one point in the discussion, Spencer laughed and said ``If he
got a bullet in the toe, it would help the election, wouldn't it.''
He clearly was nervous about his suggestion, however, and quickly
added, ``Turn that tape off. I get that cartridge when you're
through.''
   Mention of Spencer's suggestion was in the book, but the authors
elaborated on it in an article about the tapes in Sunday editions
of The Washington Post.
   As the group searched for a theme, the book says, the issue of
Social Security was quickly ruled out, with speechwriter Ken
Khachigian saying, ``We should have the next person who even
mentions the word fired.''
   The authors say that Spencer suggested Reagan might talk about
``acid rain and all that stuff,'' but Khachigian warned, ``We're
better off without it. If you get the old man going on it, he does
`killer trees'.''
   The ``killer trees'' phrase originated after Reagan expressed
the view, in his 1980 campaign, that trees cause pollution.

   About 500 people chanted a memorial prayer
for the dead Sunday as six Holocaust survivors lit candles during
dedication ceremonies for a monument called the ``Tower of
Remembrance.''
   The 80-foot granite tower _ topped by a 10-foot-high ``Eternal
Flame'' covered with gold leaf _ was erected at Sholom Memorial
Park in this Chicago suburb to honor the 6 million Jews killed in
World War II.
   ``It means a great deal for me because I went through the
Holocaust myself,'' said survivor Pola Mishell, of Skokie, who lit
her candle in memory of the Jews from her native Lithuania who died
in the war.
   Mrs. Mishell, a Hebrew teacher now in her early 60s, said she
has been active in recording and speaking about her recollections
as a teen-ager during the Holocaust.
   After the Nazis emptied the Jewish ghetto in her small
Lithuanian town, she spent 1944-45 in the Stutthof concentration
camp near the present-day Polish city of Gdansk.
   ``I feel this monument is very important because after we are
all gone something will remain to remind people that such horrible
things all happened,'' she said.
   The dedication ceremony took place during the Jewish High Holy
Days _ on the Sunday between Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year,
and Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement _ when the cemetery holds its
annual Kever Avot, or Resting Place of our Fathers, memorial
service at which families remember loved ones buried there, said
Jules Mellow, a spokesman for the cemetery.

<TEXT>
   The Pump Room, which has served meals to
celebrities from Bogart and Bacall to Belushi, and banned rocker
Phil Collins for inappropriate dress, is turning 50 and the owner
says he wants the tradition to continue.
   ``I want the stories of today to be as legendary as the ones of
40 years ago,'' said Richard Melman, who bought the historic
restaurant in the Omni Ambassador East Hotel a dozen years ago.
   The famous eatery, where Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall
celebrated their wedding, will officially mark its 50th anniversary
Oct. 1.
   The restaurant made its name as a place for show business and
high society people to see and be seen, but it also is a place
where many go to celebrate anniversaries or graduations.
   ``To this day, many people come here for special occasions _
they get very emotional about it,'' Melman said. ``So do I. I don't
feel like the owner as much as the curator of part of Chicago's
history.''
   The Pump Room was founded by Ernie Byfield in 1938 and soon
became known as the place where stars had to go when they stopped
in the Windy City on their train trips to Hollywood.
   Celebrities such as Sammy Davis Jr., Clark Gable, Bette Davis,
Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, the Duke and Duchess
of Windsor, rock group Led Zeppelin and canine beer promoter Spuds
MacKenzie have put their names or paw prints in ``The Great
Signature Book of the Pump Room.''
   A historical booklet put out as part of the anniversary
celebration lists almost 1,000 celebrities who have visited the
Pump Room.
   Customers wearing sneakers and men without jackets are politely
turned away from the restaurant _ sometimes.
   The rule apparently depends on how famous people are. One of the
most prominently displayed photographs in the restaurant shows
actor John Belushi, clad in a T-shirt, having dinner with film
critic Roger Ebert.
   But rock star Phil Collins was turned away because of
inappropriate dress by a maitre d' who did not recognize him, and
that led to the title of the singer's hit album, ``No Jacket
Required.''

   A couple who returned from a hurricane-marred
vacation Sunday said hundreds of frantic tourists were still
stranded on the battered resort isle of Cozumel, Mexico, when they
left.
   ``The airport was a madhouse,'' said Fletcher Walls of Johnson
City, Tenn. ``I'm very concerned about the conditions on Cozumel
and about the people down there.''
   He said the island's drinking water was exhausted and food and
medical supplies were running low.
   ``Cozumel is in bad shape,'' he said. ``There is no electricity
on the island and no communications with the mainland. We felt cut
off from the rest of the world after Wednesday, the day the storm
hit the island.''
   Walls said he and his wife, Sandra, were lucky to have been able
to get aboard an unscheduled charter flight that left Cozumel late
Saturday night. They arrived in Atlanta a few hours later, after a
refueling stop at New Orleans.
   ``As of Saturday, only Continental Airlines was flying into
Cozumel,'' he said. ``There were fistfights at the airport the day
before. The people there are scared. They need help.''
   He said the eye of Hurricane Gilbert passed just six miles north
of Cozumel, a small island located 11 miles off of Mexico's
Caribbean coast, 30 miles south of Cancun.
   ``People were evacuated from Cancun, but I don't know of anyone
who was able to get off of Cozumel before the storm hit,'' he said.
``There wasn't any way to leave the island once the wind picked up
and the seas got rough.''
   Authorities on Cozumel didn't seemed overly worried about the
storm until Tuesday, Walls said.
   ``Everyone seemed to think it would turn northward and miss
us,'' he said. ``But the hotel management called a meeting Tuesday
night and told the guests that Gilbert had hit Jamiaca and
apparently would reach Cozumel the next day, unless it changed
course. By then, the wind had already started to pick up.
   ``We were given some emergency supplies _ candles, drinking
water and food _ and were told to lock ourselves in the bathroom
and prop our mattress up against the bathroom door, if the storm
came our way.''
   He said he and his wife had a second-floor room and were able to
ride out the storm in that fashion.
   ``The air pressure got intense, but the sound of the wind was
the worst part,'' Walls said. ``The noise was terrific. A gust of
wind blew out our big picture window shortly after the hurricane
hit. Later, the skylight popped out and a light fixture came loose
and began banging and clanging; it sounded like the roof was coming
off.
   ``The storm hit us Wednesday morning about 6:30 a.m. and lasted
until 2 p.m. It was interesting but I wouldn't want to do it again.
We were told some of those wind gusts exceeded 200 miles per hour.''

   Orthodox Jews on Sunday mourned the loss of six
sacred scrolls that police said were set afire in a synagogue by
two neighborhood boys.
   About 5,000 people, including Mayor Edward I. Koch, turned out
for the service near Congregation Sharai Torah in the heavily
Jewish Flatbush section of the borough of Brooklyn.
   Two boys, ages 12 and 15, were arrested and accused of setting
fire to the torah scrolls and spray-painting 15 swastikas on the
walls of the synagogue. The fire damaged the interior of the
building and its contents.
   The incident occurred early Saturday, the Sabbath between Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur, the two holiest days on the Jewish calender.
   ``You couldn't do a worse crime to the Jewish people,'' said
City Councilman Noach Dear, who described the mood of the community
as one of anger, hurt and puzzlement.
   The two boys were charged Sunday as juvenile delinquents with
arson, burglary and criminal mischief, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell,
a police spokesman. They were released to the custody of their
parents.
   Neither boy is Jewish, according to another police spokesman,
Officer Hugh Barry. Barry said both youths lived near the synagogue.
   Dear said the replacement cost of the scrolls could be as high
as $50,000 each. Torahs, containing the first five books of the Old
Testament, are considered the holiest objects in Judaism. It takes
one person about one year to produce one, inscribing it by hand
under exacting religious guidelines.
   Rabbi Hillel David held a funeral service Sunday for the torahs
in accordance with Jewish law, with burial in a cemetery.
   ``He's in mourning,'' Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said of
David, who founded the congregation in 1965. ``It's as if he lost a
child.''
   The congregation is temporarily using a Jewish high school for
prayer.
   Koch said Sunday he was relieved that the suspects were
juveniles and ``not members of some organized adult organization.''
   ``The fact that they're juveniles puts a somewhat different cast
on the vicious action of arson and bias that took place,'' Koch
said. ``They have to be punished. They (also) have to be carefully
taught to respect and tolerate and even to love.''
   Others, however, found it chilling that the suspects were so
young. ``This scares everybody,'' Dear said.
   The incident came against a backdrop of a rising number of
anti-Semitic incidents nationwide, according to the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith.
   ``I have never heard of any desecration in the United States in
recent years where that number of torahs was destroyed,'' said
Justin Finger, the league's associate national director.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms spread damaging hail and high wind over parts of
Minnesota and North Dakota on Sunday, and rain from the remnants of
hurricane Gilbert spread from Texas to the Ohio Valley.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell at Fargo, N.D., and Chaffee,
N.D., got hail up to an inch in diameter.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts damaged buildings at Litchville, N.D.,
which also got 5.5 to 6 inches of rain, the National Weather
Service said. Gusts to 60 to 70 mph also caused damage at
Montpelier, N.D.
   Thunderstorms also produced heavy rain and small hail over
southwestern Lower Michigan.
   The center of what was Hurricane Gilbert poured rain and
thunderstorms over western Texas, western and central Oklahoma, the
southeastern third of Kansas, much of Missouri, northeastern
Arkansas and southern Illinois.
   There was local flooding in Texas near Comstock, Juno and
Pandale.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.96 inches of rain fell
Joplin, Mo., with 1.51 inches at Springfield, Mo.

<HEAD>New Opera, `Rasputin,' Is Startling and Unified</HEAD>

   ``Rasputin,'' which premiered over the weekend
at the New York City Opera, is a serious and sometimes shockingly
sensual production with a strong sense of unity and easily grasped
plot and music.
   The production, about the power-worshiping ``Mad Monk'' who
advised the family of Russia's last czar, is Jay Reise's first
opera. The 38-year-old Reise, who teaches music at the University
of Pennsylvania, also wrote the libretto.
   Although ``Rasputin'' was sung in English, the libretto was
shown on a screen above the New York State Theater stage so the
audience Saturday night wouldn't have to strain to understand an
unfamiliar opera. Some of the music is tonal, some atonal.
   The opera begins with Rasputin preaching carnal sin as a path to
salvation while a woman in a body stocking writhes on the floor in
front of him. This is more effective than the usual operatic orgy,
in which people wave their arms around sexlessly like undersea
plants moved by waves.
   Bass-baritone John Cheek, who sings with this company and with
the Metropolitan Opera, sang Rasputin. He is tall, young and
well-built for the bare-chested scenes but wasn't quite forceful
enough in his singing or acting.
   Rasputin is such an outrageous character that Cheek could
project still more fire. But he is definitely on the right track.
   Margaret Cusack was Czarina Alexandra, who takes Rasputin's
advice in matters of state because he once stopped her hemophiliac
son's bleeding. Ms. Cusack sung high notes that would cause some
sopranos to screech.
   Price was splendid in the third principal role, Prince Felix
Yusupov. Jon Garrison acted and sang with conviction as a terrified
Czar Nicholas relying on a strong wife. John Lankston also was
splendid as a doctor helpless before hemophilia.
   The staging, by Frank Corsaro, is direct and powerful. A
nightclub scene in which Prince Yusupov sings that he's ``Bebe
d'Amour'' is meant to indicate a decadent society just before it
falls. Price, wearing tailcoat, shorts, nylons, garter belt and
high heels, looks much like Joel Grey in ``Cabaret.''
   There is wonderful use of stylized staging. Erick Avari, in a
nonsinging role as Lenin, gives a speech behind a brightly lighted,
transparent screen. His profile and listeners facing him from
across the stage are silhouetted.
   In another scene, couples dance in silhouette at stage rear,
establishing a ballroom setting and allowing major characters
uncluttered use of the stage front.
   This uncluttered staging looks more German expressionistic than
Russian, but it suits the opera.
   Christopher Keene, who will succeed Beverly Sills as general
director of the company in March, conducted an obviously
well-prepared orchestra.
   The two-act opera isn't unusually long but some of Act 2 might
have been trimmed. Some plot points made crystal clear the first
time are retold.

   A small wagon train slowly moved
westward Sunday along the route of the Cherokee Indians' ``Trail of
Tears,'' bolstered by the arrival of two additional wagons and a
bright, blue sky.
   ``A lot of us have stiff muscles and are a little bit saddle
sore but we'll get over that,'' said Ray Morris of Golconda, Ill.,
the coordinator of the wagon train project.
   The wagon train is commemorating the 150th anniversary of the
forced removal of the Cherokees from their eastern homelands to
Oklahoma. About 4,000 of the 13,000 Indians who made the 1,000-mile
march died along the way.
   The six covered wagons set out Saturday from nearby Red Clay
State Historical Park, the last eastern council ground of the
Cherokees, bound for Tahlequah, Okla.
   No Indians have joined the group, but Morris said he expects
several to ride along as the trip progresses.
   Two wagons joined the train Saturday night when the group camped
at a farm just west of Cleveland, 17 miles from the park.
   ``We'll have dozens of wagons joining us, off and on, before we
reach Oklahoma in early December,'' Morris predicted Sunday. He
said the wagon train will average 16 miles a day as it follows the
winding route that the Cherokees took in 1838, when they walked
through Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and
Oklahoma.
   Two of the more experienced hands on the wagon train are Norman
``Muleman'' Fowler of Camden, Tenn., and his Australian sheep dog,
Clipper.
   ``Me and Clipper are big buddies. We've been on wagon trains
before,'' said Fowler, a mule skinner and logger. A pair of matched
mules pulled his wooden wagon, which is carrying the Tennessee flag
to Oklahoma.
   Fowler said he hoped to make the entire trip to Oklahoma but
might have to stop when the wagon train reaches the Kentucky border
two weeks from now. Fowler said he was expecting financial help
from the state Department of Tourism, but that apparently isn't
going to happen.
   Ricky Todd, the Tennessee state coordinator for the project,
said he is hoping some sponsors will come forward as the wagon
train moves westward.
   ``This is a private, non-profit project,'' said Todd, who raises
and sells horses. ``Our goal is to do some consciousness-raising
about the terrible thing our government did to the Cherokees.
Anybody who wants to help us, or join us, as we travel along the
trail is welcome to do so.''

<HEAD>Israel Reportedly Planning Spy Satellite</HEAD>

   Israel was planning to launch an experimental
satellite soon as part of a program to orbit a spy satellite, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The daily Hadashot, quoting foreign sources, said the
experimental part of the program would last two years and that the
spy satellite is to be carried by Israel's improved Jericho-II
missile.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refused to confirm or deny the
report.
   ``I don't deal with subjects of this type,'' Shamir said in an
interview with state-run Israel radio. ``You have to turn to the
people and industries that deal with this.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told the radio: ``I can't know
about every subject.'' Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Weinreich and
a Foreign Ministry spokesman declined comment.
   In Washington, the Pentagon and the State Department said they
had no information on the report.
   The newspaper did not further identify its foreign sources used
as a basis for the story. Such attribution is sometimes used by
Israeli newspapers to get around restrictions of the Israeli
military censor.
   Unnamed defense experts were quoted by Hadashot as saying
putting up a spy satellite could increase Israel's deterrence,
providing accurate and immediate information and the investment
would pay for itself by reducing reconnaissance flights.
   The Geneva-based International Defense Review reported in July
that Israel had successfully fired its Jericho missile into the
Mediterranean sea. Its maximum range was to reach 920 miles, the
magazine wrote.
   Two major dailies, Yediot Ahronot and Maariv, devoted front-page
articles Sunday to Israel's reported plan to launch a spy satellite.
   A decision by Israel's 25-member Cabinet, which holds its
regular meetings Sunday, was due on the launching date, Yediot
quoted the British magazine Flight International as saying.
   Yuval Neeman, head of Israel's Space Agency, told The Associated
Press that Israel was in the final stages of developing satellites
for use in communications and science. He said the first Israeli
satellite would probably be launched in 1992 by the European space
consortium Ariane.
   Asked to comment on the reports about a reconnaissance
satellite, Neeman said: ``Our present work is related to scientific
experiments and communications. It doesn't mean that sometime in
the future Israel won't move in such direction (reconnaissance).''
   Last month, Israel announced plans to launch two communication
satellites, Amos-1 and Amos-2, in early 1990s. The satellites are
to be launched by the French Ariane rocket.
   The satellite was the lead item on Israel radio throughout the
day.

<HEAD>Irish-American Official Calls for `Boycott' of Mayor Koch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINVIEW, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A refusal by New York Mayor Edward I.
Koch to meet with Irish-American leaders led a suburban official to
call Sunday for a sort of boycott of the outspoken mayor.
   Nassau County Comptroller Peter King said at a festival that
Irish-American groups should keep Koch, who is expected to seek
re-election next year, out of their organizations and activities
and resulting photographs.
   King was angered by Koch's refusal Friday to meet with
Irish-American leaders because a member of the Irish Northern Aid
Committee, Martin Galvin, was in the group. The committee supports
the attempt to drive British troops out of Northern Ireland, and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the mostly Catholic
southern Republic.
   Also in the group Friday was the national president of the
Ancient Order of Hibernians and others who had traveled to New York
City from five states for the scheduled meeting.
   Michael Cummings, spokesman for the national office of the
Ancient Order, disagreed with King's boycott proposal, saying
Irish-Americans should take advantage of contact with Koch to
educate him about the Irish conflict.
   But, he added, ``If I were Mr. Koch, I don't think I would be
attending too many Irish-American functions.''
   Koch has offended people on more than one side of the Irish
conflict, which has resulted in more than 2,000 deaths the past two
decades. When he returned from a trip to Ireland in July, he
suggested the British were a peacekeeping force rather than an
occupying army in Northern Ireland, then backed off and apologized,
angering those who liked his first statement.
   ``It is time to ban him completely from every Irish-American
activity, including the St. Patrick's Day Parade,'' King said.
   Koch, who wears a sweater he bought in Ireland during the parade
and calls himself O'Koch, welcomed the action.
   ``I am happy to be boycotted by Peter King, Mr. Galvin and other
supporters of terrorism,'' Koch said.
   ``So what, I don't care. I consider it a compliment.''
   Koch said that the group had not given him a guest list until
Thursday and when he discovered that Galvin was on it, the mayor
told them he would ``meet with anyone except the representatives of
terrorism.'' The group, he said, declined to reschedule the meeting
without Galvin.
   Pat Murphy, a spokeswoman for King, said that Jack Irwin, state
president of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, supported King's call
for a boycott.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, a former
military adviser for the Duvalier dictatorship, declared himself
president on Sunday after ousting Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Avril, adjutant general of the army, said in an early morning
address on national television that the Presidential Guard toppled
Namphy on Saturday because it was ``sickened'' by the way Namphy
governed. Namphy was sent to the neighboring Dominican Republic.
   Residents reported hearing heavy gunfire Saturday night near the
presidential palace in what appeared to be fighting between
military factions.
   Frantz Lubin, Haiti's director of information, said soldiers
were killed, but Avril mentioned no casualties.
   Haiti radio stations reported that at least six people were
killed in the capital in coup-related clashes, and that mobs
pillaged two homes owned by Namphy and the home of Port-au-Prince
Mayor Franck Romain.
   The military government appealed in a national television
broadcast ``for calm, discipline and order in respect of individual
rights and liberties.''
   A witness told The Associated Press she saw two bodies in the
courtyard of Romain's luxurious house in the suburb of Delmas and
the property was occupied by soldiers.
   ``The house was stripped, doors were torn off the hinges. It was
a shell,'' the witness said.
   Avril took over a week after about 20 men armed with machetes,
handguns and steel pikes attacked the Roman Catholic Church during
a Mass being said by the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, a vocal
critic of the military government. Thirteen people were killed and
77 wounded. Opposition leaders blamed Namphy's government for the
attack and another church burning two days later.
   On Sunday morning, slum dwellers killed and burned the body of
one man and cheered when a soldier shot and killed another man
suspected of participating in the massacre. By midday, the city was
quiet, but the airport was closed.
   Avril, who was adviser to ousted President Jean-Claude Duvalier,
said Haiti will respect all international treaties, liberties and
human rights and said that ``dialogue will be honored for the sake
of national reconciliation.''
   Lubin said Jean-Claude Paul, commander of the 700-man Dessalines
Barracks, was named commander-in-chief of the army, but Avril did
not mention Paul. Dessalines is the most feared unit in the
7,000-man army.
   Paul, who has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges
in Miami, had been considered the most powerful figure in Haiti
after Namphy. It was not known if Paul played a role in the coup,
but sources said Namphy and Paul were at odds.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman said
noncommissioned officers of the Presidential Guard captured Namphy
in an apparently bloodless coup and persuaded Avril to take over.
   She said they were believed to be ``dissatisfied with recent
human rights violations and the general deterioration in the
security situation punctuated by attacks against the churches over
the past two weeks.''
   Ms. Stockman said Avril phoned the U.S. ambassador and said he
was assuming the presidency. She said the U.S. government still
wants Paul to answer the drug trafficking charges in court.
   Namphy arrived in a private plane at a private airport in Santo
Domingo, the Dominican capital, early Sunday morning, said Fabio
Herrera Cabral, deputy foreign minister of the Dominican Republic,
which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
   Namphy, in a military uniform, was accompanied by his wife and
daughter, Herrera Cabral said. They arrived with no luggage and
climbed into a waiting limousine, an airport employee said.
   They were taken to the Dominican Concorde Hotel, where former
President Leslie Manigat stayed after Namphy toppled him in a June
17 coup, Herrera Cabral said. It was not known if Namphy would
remain in the Dominican capital.
   Avril reported Namphy's ouster at about 2:30 a.m., several hours
after shooting broke out at the main plaza in front of the
presidential palace. The gunshots sent dozens of people fleeing for
cover.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the fighting
involved army factions and members of the Tonton Macoutes, the
dreaded agents that terrorized Haitians during the 29-year
dictatorships of the Duvalier family. Details were not known.
   In his speech to members of the Presidential Guard at the
palace, Avril declared himself president and promoted himself to
lieutenant general.
   ``The Presidential Guard, sickened by the way the country has
been governed since the seventh of February, 1988 ... has been
forced to act again,'' he said.
   Avril, a bespectacled, slim man of medium height, was dressed in
a military uniform. He was introduced as ``the most honest officer
in the armed forces'' by a sergeant who wore full battle gear.
   Avril has been a key behind-the-scenes figure in a succession of
governments since nationwide riots forced Duvalier to flee to exile
in France on Feb. 7, 1986. Duvalier had been president since the
1971 death of his father, Francois Duvalier, who ruled since 1957.
   Namphy led a military junta after Duvalier fled. Avril served as
an adviser to the junta, but resigned in early 1986 after
anti-government demonstrations demanded that he and other close
Duvalier associates resign.
   In March 1987, voters overwhelmingly approved a new constitution
calling for elections under civilian control.
   Gunmen killed at least 34 voters on Election Day Nov. 29, and
the election was canceled. Soldiers from Paul's Dessalines Barracks
were blamed.
   Namphy scheduled new elections, but few people voted and Manigat
was elected on Jan. 17.
   Manigat became involved in a dispute with the military over the
transfers of Avril, Paul and other military leaders. Avril played a
key role in Namphy's June 17 overthrow of Manigat.

   An Egyptian helicopter opened fire on three
fishing boats that strayed into Egyptian waters Sunday, wounding
two Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and sinking one of the boats,
Israel radio said.
   Also Sunday, 15 Palestinians were wounded in clashes with
Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, according
to Arab reports.
   The army said a reserve soldier was jailed for meeting with
Palestinians and promising that his unit would not use force if
Arabs demonstrated peacefully.
   Israel radio said the three fishing boats were intercepted by
the helicopter about 12 miles west of the Gaza Strip. One of the
boats was set ablaze in the firing and sank, the radio said. The
whereabouts of the crew was not known, it said.
   Two wounded fishermen, brothers Azzam and Husam Bakr, were
pulled from the water by crewmen in another boat and taken to Shifa
Hospital in Gaza City.
   Azzam, 25, suffered bullet wounds in the left arm and left leg,
and 18-year-old Husam was shot in the right foot, according to a
third brother, Azmi Bakr who spoke to reporters at the hospital.
   One fisherman, whose name was not given, was arrested on charges
of leaving Israel illegally and entering another country, the radio
said.
   A Foreign Ministry official declined comment.
   On Sept. 9, the Egyptian navy seized an Israeli fishing boat and
a tour boat in the Red Sea for straying into Egyptian waters. The
tour boat was released after about five hours, but the fishing boat
and its crew remain in detention.
   Violent clashes erupted in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
on Sunday, a day earmarked by pro-PLO uprising leaders for
``confronting the occupation with force to protest the massacres
being committed against our people.''
   At least 268 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured
since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising. Six Israelis have also died.
   Arab reporters and hospital officials said 15 Palestinians were
wounded. An army official said he had reports of seven Palestinian
casualties but that the army was still investigating how the seven
were hurt.
   The worst violence occurred in the West Bank city of Nablus
where several hundred Palestinians set up barricades with rocks and
barrels to block traffic.
   When Israeli troops arrived in Nablus' central market to clear
the narrow alleys, they were pelted with stones and empty bottles,
witnesses said.
   Troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition to
break up the crowd, said the witnesses. Two Palestinians were
wounded in the clash, hospital officials said.
   In a separate incident, a 12-year-old Nablus youth, Majed Akef,
was shot in his left leg. Akef told reporters at St. John's
Hospital he was shot while playing soccer in front of his house. He
said a military jeep had been stoned nearby but that he was not
involved.
   During army sweeps in the northern West Bank town of Tulkarem, a
Palestinian youth attacked an army officer with an ax. The officer
opened fire, wounding the youth, the army said.
   Eleven other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the
occupied lands, including a 13-year-old shot in the right arm in
the West Bank town of Jenin, hospital officials said.
   Most shops and offices in Jenin were closed to protest the
shooting death of a Jenin teen-ager on Saturday.
   The army clamped curfews on seven West Bank towns and refugee
camps, confining 65,000 Palestinians to their homes.
   Also Sunday, the army said a military court sentenced a reserve
soldier to two weeks in jail for meeting with Palestinian leaders
in the West Bank town of Ramallah. An army official said the
soldier, Hillel Bardin, acted without authorization.
   Israel radio said Bardin promised the leaders his unit would not
use force if Palestinians demonstrated peacefully. Bardin's wife,
Anita, said in an interview with Israel radio her husband was only
``trying to improve relations between Jews and Arabs.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Denny Bungarz knew he
wanted to be a forest ranger from age 11, when his family camped in
northern California in the 1940s to escape a polio scare.
   He achieved that goal, and 42 years later he ended up being the
fire boss who protected the historic Old Faithful Lodge from the
firestorm that has engulfed Yellowstone National Park, the
country's oldest national park.
   ``Letting that burn would have been an end to everybody's
career, starting with mine,'' said Bungarz, who works in the
Mendocino National Forest in northern California. ``Australia
wouldn't have been far enough away for us.''
   Bungarz, 53, became a local celebrity as he appeared regularly
on national news broadcasts during the wild days of early
September, when the North Fork fire attacked the Old Faithful area
with 400-foot flames.
   That came only several days after the fire roared toward the
Montana community of West Yellowstone on the outskirts of the park.
   Protecting those areas, with the loss of some cabins at Old
Faithful, was one of the few successes of firefighters battling the
335,500-acre blaze.
   Bungarz was the incident commander on the North Fork fire during
those hectic days, but he doesn't consider himself the hero many
people think he is.
   ``We threw everything at that fire from day one. We tried
everything we knew of or could think of,'' he said. But he readily
conceded that in many ways the fire prevailed.
   ``It seemed everything we did didn't work,'' Bungarz said.
``Like one line in camp went, `What does the North Fork fire do
when the wind comes up? Whatever it wants to.'''
   Bungarz said he thinks humor is essential in the tense and often
scary business of fighting fires.
   ``It helps smooth things out when you start to have fun with
each other,'' he said.
   Bungarz directed firefighters on the North Fork fire from a camp
at Madison Junction, 14 miles east of West Yellowstone. He left
over the weekend when his team was relieved.
   Bungarz, like other firefighting officials, knows the political
firestorm over handling of the fires is just beginning. He wouldn't
be surprised to be called to testify before Congress, which plans
hearings on the fires that have affected 1.2 million acres of the
park's 2.2 million acres.
   ``We'll just tell them what happened and what we did,'' Bungarz
said. ``Our work and our meetings have been open (to the public)
all the way and they'll stay that way. If we made mistakes, we'll
take our lumps.''

   The Social Democrats kept control of
parliament and the upstart Greens environmental party won seats for
the first time, nationwide election returns showed Sunday.
   The governing party, architects of Sweden's welfare state, faced
one of its most serious election challenges in 50 years in the
first national vote since its leader, Olaf Palme, was assassinated
on Feb. 28, 1986.
   The big losers appeared to be the three non-socialist parties.
   A computer projection carried by Swedish Television, based on
returns from 340 of 360 population centers, indicated that the
Moderates, Liberals and Center Party would lose 21 of their 171
seats in the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament.
   The Social Democrats lost only one of their 159 seats and the
Greens picked up 20 seats, the television projections showed. The
computer projection indicated the Communists, which had 19 seats,
picked up two additional seats.
   Overall, the Social Democrats were projected to win 43.9 percent
of the total, or 158 seats; the Moderates, 17.9 percent, 64 seats;
the Liberals, 12 percent, or 43 seats; the Center Party, 11.9
percent, or 43 seats; the Communists, 5.7 percent, or 21 seats; the
Greens, 5.5 percent, 20 seats; and the Christian Democrats, 3.1
percent, no seats.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, leader of the Social Democrats,
said the government will hold the same course and offered a
critique of the Greens.
   ``We will stick to the same policy as before,'' he said in a
television interview. ``The interesting thing is that the
environment party entered (parliament) but are not power brokers. .
.. That is good, maybe even for them.
   ``The problem is that we don't know where they stand,'' Carlsson
said of the Greens. ``We will be able to judge them by their deeds
in the Riksdag.''
   Greens spokeswoman Eva Goes declined to say whether her party
will lean to the left or right.
   ``We'll be dynamic when it comes to ecology. That's what this
election is about, the issues of the future, the 1990s ... and you
can ask yourself whether that is left or right,'' she said in a
television interview.
   Greens members were jubilant over their victory.
   ``Great fun,'' said party spokesman Birger Schlaug. ``This was
an impossible project, to get a new party into Sweden's Riksdag.. .
Our existence means parliament will be greener, and that's what's
needed.''
   Political analyst Soren Holmberg called the showing by the three
non-socialists a ``disaster'' and ``their worst result in Swedish
history.''
   The voter turnout was an unusually low 85.8 percent of those
eligible, television reported.
   Also competing for the attention of 6.3 million registered
voters were about 100 minor parties. They ranged from the Socialist
Workers' Party, which opposes foreign immigration to Sweden, to the
Donald Duck Party, a joke party with no platform for voters who
might otherwise turn in blank ballots.
   Swedes also choose 284 municipal and 24 county councils and vote
on local issues.
   A series of scandals have eroded support for the Social
Democrats in the past two years. Among them was failure of police
to find Palme's killer and reports of official bungling in the
investigation.
   At the same time, opposition to nuclear power and growing
environmental concerns, especially among young people, drew support
to the Greens and away from the established parties.
   Pre-election polling suggested the Communists were in danger of
being shut out for the first time since their founding in 1917.
   On the eve of the election, Carlsson, got mediocre reviews on
his performance in a televised debate Friday night.
   With the exception of 1976-1982, when the country was governed
by a center- right coalition, the Social Democrats have been at the
helm of the Swedish welfare state since 1932.
   In the election campaign, they stressed their economic
successes, such as reducing unemployment from 3 percent to 1.7
percent, one of the world's lowest rates. They also stressed
standardized health care, child care and universal education in
Sweden, where poverty is practically unknown.
   The country's taxes are, however, the highest in the world. An
employee making the equivalent of $50,000 a year can expect to give
half of it to the government, and the rate can reach up to 80
percent for higher incomes.
   Consumer prices are boosted by a 23.4 percent value added tax
rate and inflation, about 7 percent so far this year, is roughly
twice the European average.
   The three non-socialist parties proposed various options for tax
reforms. They also urged a loosening of welfare regulations that
would allow Swedes to choose private health care and schools for
their children.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The motives behind Sunday's
military coup in Haiti were obscure, but the first reaction from
advocates of democratic reform was optimism.
   ``I will support the military government if they say as soon as
possible when they will call elections. We are ready to speak with
any government that respects human rights,'' said Louis Dejoie II,
60-year-old leader of the national Agricultural Industrial Party,
said by telephone from Puerto Rico.
   Brig. Gen. Prosper Avril, who seized power in a palace coup from
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, promised in his first public statement to
respect civil liberties, human rights and said ``dialogue will be
honored for the sake of national reconciliation.''
   The statement was considered signficant because it echoed a
recent offer for dialogue from opposition leader Marc Bazin, a
conservative leader of the Committee for Democratic Understanding.
   Bazin and Dejoie were among the four leading candidates for
president in the Nov. 29 elections that were aborted by the
independent Electoral Council when armed thugs supported by the
army attacked voters at the polls. The council was later abolished
by Namphy, who held new elections Jan. 17.
   The leading candidates boycotted the second election, which was
won by Leslie Manigat, who was in office only four months when
Namphy ousted him in a bloodless coup.
   ``In the next week or so, I expect them (the military) to say
when elections will be held. They must do it or they won't have any
support,'' Dejoie said.
   Even Haiti's small Communist Party expressed pleasure with the
turn of events.
   ``This ... has come at the right moment to put an end to a
government which was going to lead the country to an abyss ... We
greet with satisfaction the first declaration of the new
president,'' said Max Bourjolly, second in command of the party.
   Another opposition politician, Hubert de Ronceray, runner-up to
Manigat in the military-controlled elections of Jan. 17, said,
``All our difficulties come from the absence of dialogue. Dialogue
is indispensable to the democratic process. Bazin has only revived
the theme.''
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
predicted the new military government will maintain the old
cabinet, but propose an opening to civilians with a view to
elections.
   He also said other motives played a role in the coup.
   ``The coup seems to have begun, as the coup against Manigat did,
with the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the 1,000-man
Presidential Guard,'' he said. ``Under Manigat, they felt slighted
and felt their privileges threatened. Under Namphy, they did not
receive the material signs of recognition they expected, and on top
of that, the atrocity last Sunday must have affected these men of
the people ... (while) the High Command stood by.''
   On Sept. 11, about 20 men armed with machetes, handguns and
steel pikes attacked a church during a Mass being said by the Rev.
Bertrand Aristide, a militant opponent of the military government.
Thirteen people were killed and 77 wounded. Namphy's government was
blamed by opponents for the violence.
   The Presidential Guardsmen were the first military men to
publicly condemn the government.
   The diplomat speculated that the fact that Col. Jean-Claude Paul
did not intervene with his 700-man Dessalines Battalion indicated
he was in favor of ousting Namphy.
   ``Avril's margin of maneuver will be limited by the NCOs, who
have gotten a taste for power, having now overthrown two
governments, one civilian, one military,'' he said.
   There was at least one opponent of Namphy who was still not
satisfied with developments.
   Sylvio Claude, leader of the Christian Democratic Party and one
of Haiti's most popular politicians, said in an interview on Radio
Soleil Sunday, ``The coup was imminent, but the person who replaced
Namphy is unacceptable. He was already rejected (by the people). He
is known as a Duvalierist and all Duvalierists are criminals.''

<HEAD>Priests Asked To Support Gun Control Law In Homilies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic priests in the Baltimore
Archdiocese were urged to support the state's handgun control law
during their Sunday homilies to parishioners.
   The request was made by the archdiocese's Justice and Peace
Commission in a strongly worded letter signed by its director,
Christine A.W. Doby.
   A referendum on rescinding the law, which bans cheap, easily
concealable handguns, will be on the Nov. 8 ballot. Opponents
collected enough signatures to bring it before the voters.
   The letter, sent to the 700 priests in the archdiocese, refers
to the opponents of the law as ``apostles of violence'' running ``a
campaign of propaganda based on deception'' in their effort to
defeat the ban.
   There was no immediate indication whether priests had complied
with the request. The archdiocese includes all the state except
southern Maryland, the Washington suburbs and the eastern shore.
   The handgun control law was passed by the 1988 Maryland General
Assembly and signed by Gov. William Donald Schaefer. The law
establishes an appointed board to compile a roster of handguns that
may be made or sold in the state after Jan. 1, 1990.
   Fred Griiser, chairman of the Maryland Committee Against the Gun
Ban, criticized the commission's tactic, saying that by issuing the
letter to priests, the church was ``putting words in the priests'
mouths.''
   ``Does this now mean all Catholics are against us?'' Griiser
asked. ``I don't think what the church is for, is to take a stand
on government issues. I'm sorry to see they're getting involved in
it. If the church's job is spiritual guidance, that's what they
should stick to.''
   Ms. Doby said urging priests to speak on a local public issue
was ``very unusual.'' She said the mailing was ``not the
Archdiocese of Baltimore telling priests: `This is what you're
supposed to say.' These are not marching orders. This is not a
script.''
   The bishops of the Maryland Catholic Conference are already on
record as supporting the law.
   Supporters contend the law will curb the proliferation of cheap
handguns called Saturday Night Specials, while opponents say they
fear it could eventually prohibit the sale of all new handguns.

   The Christian-led army said Sunday it
rejected what it called an attempt by the United States and Syria
to name a new Lebanese president.
   Christians and Moslems in the Lebanese Parliament, which is
empowered to name a successor to President Amin Gemayel before his
term ends Friday, have been deadlocked for five weeks over who will
be the new head of state.
   The military command said in a statement that army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun was informed by an American official that U.S.
envoy Richard Murphy and Syrian leaders agreed ``to name the
Lebanese president.''
   The statement thanked them for their efforts to find ways of
ending the stalemate that threatens to reignite Lebanon's
13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians.
   But it indirectly accused the Americans and Syrians of meddling
in Lebanese affairs.
   ``The army cannot accept the principle of appointing a Lebanese
president because the choice of the president should be made
exclusively by the Lebanese Parliament,'' the statement said.
   Constitutionally, Gemayel cannot run for a second consecutive
six-year term.
   The army issued the statement soon after Murphy, assistant
secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, said he was confident
Parliament will resolve its deadlock.
   ``I certainly hope so because I think that the choice of no
election ... would be a very unfortunate choice indeed,'' he told
reporters after meeting with Gemayel and other leaders.
   He flew from Beirut to Larnaca, Cyprus, in a Lebanese military
helicopter after the talks. Airport sources in Larnaca said he
caught a scheduled flight to Paris en route to Washington.
   A Lebanese army source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
one of Murphy's aides, David Newton, met Aoun at his residence in
Nakkash, north of Beirut, and told him of the alleged deal worked
out by Murphy and Syrian officials in Damascus during the last five
days.
   Christian sources, also speaking anonymously, said Auon was told
the Americans and Syrians agreed to support the election of
Christian Parliament member Mikhail Daher as president. Daher, 58,
represents Akkar province in north Lebanon, an area controlled by
the Syrian Army, which has some 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. television station run by the
Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, said Gemayel and the
Maronite patriarch, Mar Nasrallah Butros, told Murphy they opposed
Daher's selection.
   It said the militia, sympathetic to Israel and bitterly opposed
to Syrian intervention, also rejected ``Daher's appointment'' as
president.
   The army statement did not explicitly say it would take military
action to prevent the appointment of any president not elected by
Parliament.
   An attempt to hold parliamentary voting to choose a new
president collapsed Aug. 18 after pro-Israeli Christians opposed
the candidacy of Syrian-backed former president Suleiman Franjieh
and boycotted the session. A 51-member quorum is required to elect
a president.
   Sources close to Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite
Moslem, said he will advance the date set for a parliamentary
session to elect a new president from Thursday to Tuesday.
   Murphy arrived in Beirut from Damascus earlier Sunday after four
days of intensive talks with Syrian leaders on how to break the
electoral deadlock in Lebanon.
   Asked whether agreement has been reached on a consensus
candidate, Murphy said: ``I don't want to go into details ... The
current situation is very sensitive and delicate.''

   Two construction workers were rescued Sunday
evening after spending seven hours trapped on scaffolding dangling
as high as 18 stories up a building, rescue officials said.
   After the motor used to raise and lower the apparatus failed,
Fire Department rescuers and state police lowered ropes with safety
belts to the workers.
   But plans to lower the men, by rope and using a helicopter, were
rejected as too risky. Rescuers finally decided to tell the workers
to disengage the motor and manually lower the scaffolding from the
18th floor.
   The men had lowered themselves by about 7 p.m. to a position
along the First Fidelity Building where fire ladders could reach
them.
   The identity of the two men, who were recaulking the building,
was not immediately available.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, his shoulders
draped with a leopard skin, on Sunday urged the Marxist government
and rebels to end their 12-year civil war and called for
international aid to rebuild the country.
   ``I felt the heart of the people bleed,'' the pope told Roman
Catholic bishops, criticized by the government for advocating
negotiations with the Mozambique National Resistance rebels.
   During the last full day of a 10-day trip through southern
Africa, the pope comforted victims whose limbs were blown off by
land mines, celebrated Mass at a soccer stadium decked with
political banners and was greeted by a boisterous crowd of 5,000
when he blessed an orphanage in a slum of reed huts.
   He met with anti-apartheid clergy leaders from neighboring South
Africa, which Mozambique's government has accused of aiding the
guerrilla insurgency. The civil war began shortly after Mozambique
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ``With violence, nothing can be built and much is lost,'' he
said, urging citizens of this nation on the Indian Ocean coast of
southeastern Africa to follow ``the path of dialogue and
reconciliation which will stop the spilling of blood among
brothers.''
   Addressing himself to the rebels, the pope said: ``Abandon the
paths of violence and vengeance. Put aside destructive action and
try to save what's left.''
   The government, he said, ``should make efforts in the sense of
building.''
   ``This nation needs assistance from other peoples and from the
international community,'' he said. ``Let me stress the urgency of
this solidarity, aimed at a quick, total pacification and immediate
aid grants to save a large amount of human lives.''
   The government accuses the guerrillas of massacres and
destruction of crops. The rebels deny such charges.
   Among the crowd of about 50,000 were the anti-apartheid church
leaders from South Africa, including the Rev. Allan Boesak,
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Rev.
Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African Council of
Churches. They are leaders of a civil disobedience campaign
challenging emergency regulations and apartheid, South Africa's
system of racial segregation.
   Boesak and Chikane, at a news conference following the meeting
with the pope, criticized John Paul for meeting with South African
authorities.
   Boesak suggested that the pope should have made more explicit
criticisms of apartheid during his 10-day tour of southern Africa,
which included an unscheduled stop in South Africa because of bad
weather in Lesotho.
   Boesak said the three-hour papal stop in Johannesburg was a
propaganda coup for South African authorities, who had complained
previously about the omission of their country from the official
itinerary.
   Chikane said at the news conference that the pope had met with
officials who were ``persecuting us'' and had been escorted by
``people who torture us.''
   Banners at Machava Sports Stadium bore slogans such as
``Apartheid is the Nazism of our era'' and ``One does not negotiate
the motherland, one defends it.''
   During his homily, the pope said Mozambique should be afforded
``peace from the outside, of an ideological, military and economic
nature'' _ an apparent reference to South Africa, which has been
accused of using a variety of tactics to harrass Mozambique.
   The pope wore a leopard skin, a symbol of power to many
Africans. Most of the crowd at the stadium joined a 300-strong
choir in singing the hymn ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus' in the
Tsonga language, to the accompaniment of drums and hand-clapping.
   Gifts of ivory carvings, fruit and a brass chalice were carried
up a red-carpeted stairway to the altar. Children released balloons
and white doves, one of which alighted briefly on the head of a
white-robed priest.
   The pontiff, who returns to Rome on Monday, has visited
Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho and made a brief,
unscheduled stop in South Africa when his plane was diverted in bad
weather.
   The war in Mozambique has forced 2 million of the 14.5 million
population to flee their homes and left millions more in need for
foreign food aid.
   Mozambique has been campaigning for more international relief
aid. Food and other supplies do not always reach the rural areas
where they are needed because of attacks by guerrillas and
transportation difficulties.
   John Paul offered $50,000 to patients at Maputo Central
Hospital, where he visited six wards before the Mass. He blessed
and gave Vatican medals to amputees and other victims of guerrilla
attacks, and he kissed children lying in their beds.
   ``I suffer because you are suffering and it is not in my power
to cure you,'' the pope said.
   In July, the Vatican tried to encourage peace efforts in
Mozambique by sending one of John Paul's top aides to meet
separately with Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano and South
African President P.W. Botha.
   Chissano met the pope last May in Rome, but the Vactican appears
to be holding off the establishment of diplomatic relations as an
incentive to advancing the peace process.
   About one-eighth of Mozambique's people are Catholic. The
government does nothing to promote or encourage religion, but
tolerates the Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups and
has been working to improve strained relations.
   The government recently returned places of worship that it said
were mistakenly confiscated during a period of nationalization
following independence. But hospitals and schools formerly run by
churches remain nationalized.

<TEXT>
   Workers searched on Sunday for the
bodies of up to 200 people swept away when a river poured over its
banks and overturned four buses. Ninety people were confirmed dead.
   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter lost power and crashed during
evacuation operations in Sabinas de Hidalgo, but no one was
injured, officials said.
   The buses were caught in the path of the Santa Catarina River
when a flash flood spawned by Hurricane Gilbert ripped a
40-mile-long path of destruction Saturday through northern Mexico's
most populated region.
   It was the epilogue to a week of death and havoc caused by
Gilbert, which ravaged the Yucatan Peninsula resort areas of
Cancun, Cozumel and Isla Mujeres before crossing the Gulf of Mexico
and hitting Mexico again in the northeast near Texas.
   The storm killed at least 98 people while coursing the
Caribbean, including 29 in the Yucatan when it hit land last
Wednesday with winds of up to 200 mph, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti,
five in the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras. Two people
were klled Saturday in Texas by tornados spawned by the storm.
   But it was in this capital of the state of Nuevo Leon where
Gilbert exacted its highest death toll after it weakened into a
tropical storm late Friday.
   Gilbert's rains created a 10-foot-deep, 150-yard-wide torrent of
muddy water by Saturday when the river roared through Monterrey. By
Sunday, it was almost back to its normal size of 20 feet, allowing
soldiers to use cranes to pull the crushed body of one intercity
passenger bus from the mud.
   ``They hope to find bodies because they don't know exactly how
many people were in the bus or how many were able to save
themselves,'' said rescue coordinator Lt. Col. Vicente Gamez of the
7th Military Zone.
   The first bus yanked by its chassis from a murky grave in the
Monterrey riverbed revealed only empty seats, twisted metal and
piles of shoes and clothing.
   Soldiers used picks to dig through the rubble of mud, stones and
tree branches inside the bus's crushed remains.
   Another bus, also upside down and crushed, lay in the gravel on
the other side of the stream. The remains of two other buses were
further downstream.
   Gamez said only two survivors were located by Sunday.
   Eduardo Pichardo, an employee of the Transportes de la Frontera
bus line, said he believed about 64 people were aboard the two
buses from his company that were destroyed in the flood.
   It was not known how many other passengers were aboard the other
two buses, one identified as belonging to the Transportes Noreste
line and another, possibly an urban bus.
   But state officials said the total aboard the four buses was
about 200 and that 90 people were confirmed dead. A ``considerable
number'' of people were missing, said Jose Natividad Gonzalez
Baras, Nuevo Leon state secretary.
   The storm left 30,000 people homeless and caused about $60
million in damages to public roads, bridges and other facilities in
the metropolitan Monterrey, Gonzalez Baras said.
   President Miguel de la Madrid toured damaged areas in Monterrey
Sunday. ``I want to extend my most sincere condolences to the
families of those that lost their lives,'' he said.
   Four state judicial policemen and two civilian volunteers also
drowned when they attempted to rescue victims, state authorities
said.
   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter evacuating residents from the
small town of Colorado Abajo to nearby Sabinas Hidalgo lost power
about 3:45 p.m. as it took off and fell about 50 feet, brushing a
house under construction, the Sabinas Hidalgo municipal police
reported.
   Commander Leopoldo Villarreal said the three Americans and one
Mexican on board were taken to the local hospital for a checkup and
released. Their names were not immediately available.
   About 12 inches of rain fell over the 24-hour period before the
flood, but the destruction was caused by runoff from the towering
peaks of the Sierra Madre Oriental chain that surrounds this
semi-arid metropolitan area.
   Meanwhile, in northeastern Mexico, U.S. Coast Guard aircraft
from New Orleans were picking up scores of people near Vallecillo
that were threatened by swollen rivers as scattered rains continued
in northeastern Mexico and parts of Texas. Mexican state
authorities requested the Coast Guard assistance.
   Gamez said other rescue crews were searching for bodies in
Cadereyta about 20 miles downstream from Monterrey where the flood
also wiped out homes and killed more than a dozen people.
   An estimated 20,000 people packed shelters throughout the area
Sunday, most left homeless when the flood swept away homes built
along the river's edge.
   The homes were evacuated hours before the destruction hit, but
most of the poor residents who occupied them lost their life's
possessions.
   Many used picks or bare hands to dig through the rubble that
remained where their tiny concrete and tin houses had stood.
   They hoped to rescue scant possessions: a tiny mud-covered
television set, a twisted metal kitchen cabinet, a pair of shoes
that no longer could be of any use.

<HEAD>Theaters Tighten Security After Two Shootings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two theaters bolstered security after two
youths were shot and hundreds more were involved in fights during
the weekend premiere of a rap music movie.
   The first shooting occurred after the management of a downtown
theater, AMC Midtown, announced the 9:30 showing Friday night of
``Tougher Than Leather'' featuring the rap group Run-DMC was
canceled and asked those with ticket stubs to line up for refunds.
   Fights broke out in the lobby and the auditorium of the theater,
as groups of teen-agers from different neighborhoods taunted each
other and hurled popcorn and soda across the seats, according to
witnesses and police.
   Minutes later, with about 200 people still inside the darkened
auditorium, shots rang out, officials said.
   Filmgoers rushed out of the theater. The injured youth, Wayne
Brown, collapsed a half-block away with a wound in his buttocks.
   Brown was released from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital
Saturday.
   In the second incident, at the Eric 3 on the Campus theater,
near Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania, two
youths began arguing during the movie at about 10:40 p.m.,
according to usher Charles Hancock.
   ``One guy yells, `I got a gun.' Everybody started rushing for
the doors,'' Hancock said.
   Fights broke out, and before the melee ended, a 19-year-old man
walking by the theater was shot in the hip. Orville Walls was in
good condition Sunday night at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania.
   Police declined to link the shooting with the violence inside
the theater. Walls said Sunday the angle of the shot indicated the
gunman was on the sidewalk and not inside the theater doors.
   Detective Alfred Bilstein said no further incidents were
reported Saturday or Sunday.
   The AMC Midtown canceled two Saturday matinees but reopened
Saturday night with the movie playing on both screens. A half-dozen
police officers stood guard.
   ``We don't feel it is the movie that caused the problems,'' said
Midtown general manager Jim Francisco. ``The movie isn't that
violent. We think the major problem was that we didn't have enough
seats to accommodate all the potential customers.''
   Police agreed.
   ``Now that they are showing in both theaters, they have
alleviated much of the problems,'' Bilstein said. ``No one is
waiting outside now.''
   At the other theater, manager Dean Lindo said he would use seven
security guards instead of two and 10 ushers instead of six.
   ``I'm going to talk with our district manager and try to get
this movie out of here,'' Lindo said. ``We're very upset because
the theater is geared mainly toward college students.''
   Concerts featuring Run-DMC in other cities in recent years have
attracted youth gangs and resulted in violence and relatively large
numbers of drug and theft arrests.

<HEAD>Pavarotti Sounds Golden at Recital in Met Opera</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the Metropolitan Opera started presenting
occasional Sunday recitals by some of its singers in 1978, tenor
Luciano Pavarotti, already a superstar, sang the first one.
   On Sunday, he sang his second one, with Met artistic director
James Levine accompanying on piano. If his voice has lost quality
in the 10 years, you'd never know it from this recital.
   He looks physically fit, too, and has not put back all the
weight he lost in last year's bout of slimming.
   Levine complements a singer beautifully, neither keeping the
piano too far in the background nor pushing too far forward.
   Pavarotti began with a love aria from Mozart's ``Cosi fan
tutte'' and there was a hint of strain there, though a listener had
to strain to be sure of it. From then on, all was golden.
   Pavarotti not only has a surpassingly beautiful tone but it is
individual. If you turn on a radio and he's singing, you know it's
Pavarotti. On Sunday, his voice was flexible in fast passages and
his tones were rounded and substantial. His voice filled out, later
in his career than he expected, from its early small-scaled purity.
   Acting with his voice isn't Pavarotti's strongest quality but he
shaded into an effective pianissimo several times. It wasn't
ultraquiet pianissimo but it was soft enough to express the emotion
called for.
   He bit into the ``M'appari'' aria from Von Flotow's opera
``Martha'' with deep familiarity and the audience responded at the
end with especially lengthy applause.
   Another of the special winners was ``Pourquoi me reveiller''
from Massenet's ``Werther.'' Audiences know how they'd like to hear
that sung in the opera and Pavarotti made that idea materialize. In
the darker parts of the aria, he didn't make it extremely dark,
just shaded.
   He didn't sing only arias but included some art songs, by
Bellini, Respighi and one each by Mascagni, Sibella and Denza.
Encores included an aria from ``Tosca,'' ``Marie Chiare'' by Tosti
and ``Nessun dorma'' from ``Turandot,'' the melodically soaring
aria which Pavarotti likes to make his final encore.

<HEAD>Cemetery Dedicated For Canadian Veterans Of Vietnam War</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ST-BERNARD-DE-LACOLLE, Quebec (AP) _ Uniformed veterans marched
in this town near the U.S. border on Sunday and dedicated a
national cemetery for Canadians who fought in the Vietnam War.
   Organizers described the event as the official ``welcome home''
for Canadians who served in the U.S. military in Vietnam.
   The cemetery was named after Richard Paul Dextraze, one of 70
Canadians who died in Vietnam. They were remembered in two days of
religious services and ceremonies in this farming community of
1,500, about 25 miles south of Montreal near the New York border.
   Jacques Dextraze said his family was not surprised when his
younger brother, Richard Paul, went south to join the U.S. Marines.
But he said his father was probably the most upset when the
21-year-old died in action in 1969.
   ``The Canadian government (the military) wasn't doing anything
that excited a kid his age and with the American forces being
involved in Vietnam, he went there for more action,'' said
Dextraze, 45.
   ``It's touching that something has finaly been done for the
fellows in Canada,'' he said. ``It was a long time coming.''
   About 20,000 Canadians served in Vietnam. Currently, the U.S.
government provides some medical benefits for Canadian Vietnam vets.
   Yvon Roy, 44, a burly former member of the U.S. Army's elite
Green Berets, led a platoon of about 30 Canadian Vietnam veterans
in the parade. The procession also included a contingent from the
Royal Canadian Legion, a U.S. Army marching band from Fort Drum,
N.Y., and color guards and a firing squad from Plattsburgh Air
Force Base, N.Y.
   Many of the Vietnam vets wore their service decorations and
camouflaged jungle uniforms.
   About 300 townsfolk lined the half-mile route and applauded the
parade when it procession arrived at the cemetery, where a
miniature replica of the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington is to
be erected Nov. 11.
   The Canadian Forces did not send a delegation. Gen. Paul Manson,
chief of defense staff, told organizers in a letter last week that
Ottawa does not recognize the voluntary participation of Canadians
in foreign conflicts in which Canada does not take part.
   But Roy, one of the event's main organizers, said he was pleased
with the dedication ceremonies, carried out under overcast skies
and which included a 21-gun salute and two U.S. service buglers
blowing taps.
   The only Canadian government representative at the ceremony was
from the Veterans Affairs Department, although Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney sent a message of goodwill, as did President Reagan.

<TEXT>
   The remains of Hurricane Gilbert
passed across Texas Sunday, swelling rivers as hundreds of people
began clearing debris from homes and businesses damaged by at least
41 tornadoes spun off by the storm.
   Bob Gibson, controller at the state's Emergency Operating Center
in Austin, said Sunday night that his office was monitoring areas
where flash flood and tornado watches were in effect until Sunday
night, but had no reports of significant flooding.
   ``It's been actually pretty light tonight,'' he said. ``I think
we're still lucky.''
   Nearly 2 inches of rain fell Sunday at Quanah, northwest of
Wichita Falls, which had a thunderstorm and high wind Sunday night,
and some roads were under water in Ozona in West Texas Sunday
afternoon, the National Weather Service reported.
   The remains of Gilbert were moving out of Texas and into
Oklahoma late Sunday night, the weather service said. Forecasters
told residents of central Oklahoma and southeast Kansas to watch
for possible flooding early Monday.
   In Texas, tornadoes touched down just to the west of Abilene
Sunday at Lake Sweetwater and at Eskota, but only minor damage was
reported, the weather service said.
   A total of 41 tornadoes swept the state as the remains of
Gilbert headed northward, officials said. Two people were reported
killed, both in San Antonio late Friday and Saturday.
   State officials said they did not expect to have a dollar
estimate of damages throughout the state for a few days.
   Trees and roofs were blown away at Kelly Air Force Base, causing
$3 million damage. Scores of apartments were destroyed or damaged
at one complex. Telephone and electric service was knocked out in
areas.
   An air-conditioning system at a Veterans Administration Hospital
was damaged, prompting Mayor Henry Cisneros to declare a state of
emergency so replacement parts could be flown in and the transfer
of patients avoided.
   ``San Antonio was very lucky,'' Cisneros said. ``We could have
had 15, 20, 25 or 50 people killed in this incident.''
   In northeastern Mexico, Coast Guard aircraft picked up people
threatened by swollen rivers Sunday, but a dam thought to be in
danger was re-evaluated and declared safe, said Laureen Chernow of
the state Emergency Management Council.
   At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamed
on the storm in the Caribbean and Mexico. An additional 90 deaths
were confirmed and more than 100 others were feared drowned after a
rain-swollen river overturned four buses in Monterrey, Mexico.
   The Rio Grande in Terrell County in southwest Texas rose 30 feet
overnight and was up to 12 feet above flood stage Sunday evening,
officials said.
   But high water that had forced the closing of two farm-to-market
roads had subsided, said Sonny Holleyman, a Terrell County deputy
sheriff. The roads were reopened and a rock slide that also blocked
one of those roads had been cleared, he said.
   Authorities in the Texas Hill Country, a ranching and farming
area, kept an eye on the flood-prone Guadalupe River, but no
flooding was reported.
   In San Antonio, telephone and utility crews worked to restore
service, and residents of apartments and houses hit by tornadoes
began cleaning up.
   A twister struck a mobile home near downtown early Saturday,
killing 59-year-old Emily Dickens, who was thrown about 100 feet
from her bedroom. Recently widowed, she was sharing the trailer
with her son and daughter-in-law.
   ``We're all pretty much in a daze. We really don't know how to
react to anything right now,'' said the daughter-in-law, Deborah
Dickens. ``We'll take one day at a time. We'll clean up and
eventually we'll get our own house put up if we get some money to
buy lumber and tin.''
   On Friday, a man was killed when a tornado knocked a tree onto
his house in San Antonio.
   Sylvia Sulsh, 54, was taking a shower when the tornado struck
her third-story apartment at The Lodge apartments, where at least
120 units were destroyed, 264 others damaged and some 300 tenants
left homeless.
   ``There was all this insulation all over me in the shower. I got
out of the shower and braced myself against the door and then I saw
all the roof fall down in the living room,'' Ms. Sulsh said.
   ``I was open to the world, so I grabbed my nightgown and robe. I
was more worried about getting my clothes on than being sucked out
of the shower by the wind.''

   Celebrities joined with former political
prisoners for a rally Sunday in front of the Liberty Bell on the
eve of an Amnesty International concert to promote human rights.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode joined actresses Margot Kidder and Holly
Robinson, activists and former prisoners from South Africa,
Argentina and Cambodia in encouraging the crowd to sign a petition
in support of the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
   ``We can no longer afford to remain silent,'' said Ms. Kidder.
``We must recognize that what happens to our brothers and sisters
around the world affects us. We must lead our leaders. We must
teach them respect for human rights. We must teach them to love.''
   Monday's concert is part of a six-week worldwide concert tour by
Amnesty International to mark the 40th anniversary of the human
rights declaration.
   Concerts are also scheduled for Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Amnesty International, based in London, monitors human rights
abuses, particularly the plight of political prisoners. The
organization won the 1977 Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``We give concerts, we speak out, and we never, never remain
silent. Make the Universal Declaration of Human Rights a reality
instead of the beautiful dream it is,'' Ms. Kidder said.
   The former ``prisoners of conscience'' who attended the rally
included Alicia Partnoy, a former prisoner in Argentina jailed for
her activities as a student.
   Amnesty International spokeswoman Lee Blumer said prisoners of
conscience are those who have been imprisoned for their beliefs or
religion and non-violent and non-criminal acts.
   Ms. Partnoy, who was imprisoned by the military junta in
Argentina in 1976, spoke of the five months she spent as one of the
30,000 ``disappeared,'' people imprisoned, tortured or killed in
the wake of the 1976 coup.
   ``The military's purpose was to silence me and to silence my
friends,'' said Ms. Partnoy, author of ``The Little School,'' the
nickname for the torture center where she was held near her
hometown of Bahia Blanca.
   ``They succeeded in silencing many of my friends, but if I have
the opportunity to relate what happened, then I will never feel
defeated,'' said Ms. Partnoy, who works as a translator in
Washington, D.C.
   The tour opened in England Sept. 2 and is scheduled to end in
Argentina on Oct. 15. Concerts are also scheduled for Los Angeles
and San Francisco in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Burton Benjamin, a CBS executive and news
producer, died Sunday at his home in Scarborough after a long
illness. He was 70.
   Benjamin held a number of positions during 29 years at the
network before he retired in 1985, including executive producer of
the ``CBS Evening News'' and ``CBS Reports.''
   Benjamin was involved in every area of CBS News programming,
from daily news events to specials and documentaries.
   In 1982, he was called on to lead the internal CBS inquiry into
the controversial ``CBS Reports'' documentary, ``The Uncounted
Enemy: A Vietnam Deception.'' The CBS program led to a libel suit,
settled out of court, in which Gen. William C. Westmoreland
disputed charges that he ordered subordinates to lower their
estimates of enemy troop strength in Vietnam.
   Benjamin recently wrote a book, ``Fair Play,'' about the episode.
   From 1978 to 1981, Benjamin served as vice president, director
of news, and supervised the development of ``CBS Sunday Morning.''
   He was the executive producer of the ``CBS Evening News with
Walter Cronkite'' from 1975 to 1978. CBS said that during his years
with the network, Benjamin received eight Emmy awards and a Peabody
award.
   He is survived by his wife, Aline, and two daughters.

   Michael Dukakis had already begun to fire back at
George Bush before former aide John Sasso rejoined his campaign,
but Dukakis has become even more combative since, his sharpened
rhetoric bearing the stamp of the man he likens to a brother.
   Exiled from the campaign a year ago, after admitting his role in
the videotape that helped drive Sen. Joseph Biden from the
presidential race, Sasso returned to Dukakis' side two weeks ago.
And the friends who gathered to welcome him back erupted in
approval when he made a simple declaration:
   ``There are contrasts and weaknesses that are issues in this
campaign. I will not shy away from pointing these contrasts out.''
   The return of Dukakis' longtime political alter ego came at a
time when the Democratic presidential nominee had lost the momentum
he gained from his party's national convention and as he was being
criticized for not responding aggressively to attacks from George
Bush and his fellow Republicans.

   Blame it on long campaign days with multiple
stops, jet lag, or whatever. Bloopers are becoming a standard
feature of George Bush's stump speeches.
   ``You ought to vote for me. I knew about Pearl Harbor three
months before it happened,'' Bush joked last week, trying to take
the edge off his mistake about the date of the Japanese attack that
led America into World War II. He had said it was on Sept. 7
instead of Dec. 7.
   Since that foulup, it seems that Bush slips in every speech.
   Bush said last week that when he makes a mistake, he's fair game
for attack by Dukakis _ and vice versa.
   ``We'll foul up and he'll jump on me, and he'll make some
mistakes and I'll jump on him, but the thing is to get the issues
out there so the American people can see them.

   Barry Goldwater says he's enjoying the quiet
life in retirement, sitting in the Arizona sun and watching the
robins on his windowsill. But his mind, of late, has been back in
Washington, reliving past battles on the Potomac.
   What he remembers isn't at all flattering to those who served
with him, and what he sees for the future isn't always reassuring.
Barry Goldwater, as always, is still speaking bluntly.
   At age 79, Goldwater has written another book, reflecting on his
30-year career as a United States senator, his 1964 Republican
presidential bid, and the people and events he encountered along
the way. ``Goldwater,'' written with Jack Casserly, will be
published by Doubleday on Oct. 12.
   ``Nostalgia for the old days and other times rises like the sun
most of my mornings,'' Goldwater says. ``But in the evening, when
the cool desert air refreshes my spirit, my blood flows faster and
I shake my fist at the present.''

   How Israeli Arabs vote in the Nov. 1 election
may be crucial in deciding a close vote between Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres'
Labor Party.
   ``The two major parties are running neck and neck. The Arabs
might well decide the election, especially if they desert the Labor
Party,'' said Elihu Katz, a pollster for the Israel Institute of
Applied Social Research.
   About 330,000 Arabs living in Israel are eligible to vote this
year, and they could control 14 or 15 seats in the 120-member
Parliament if all cast ballots.
   Getting a feel for how Arabs will vote is difficult because
Israeli pollsters do not survey Palesinians, in part because
Israeli opinion takers are viewed with suspicion in Arab areas.
   The only organized opinion sampling is by the Bustani
Advertising Co., and its findings tended to support those of
Israeli analysts such as Gutmann and Katz who said the Arabs would
shun Israeli parties for more radical Arab ones.

   Remember President Reagan's nationally
televised pledge last January to veto future catchall spending
bills like the $600 billion behemoth Congress sent him last year,
and the promises by scores of lawmakers from both parties not to do
it again?
   Guess what may be about to happen.
   As the Oct. 1 start of the 1989 fiscal year approaches,
increasing numbers of senators and representatives, and their
aides, concede that an omnibus spending bill looms as a real
possibility.
   It wouldn't be as large as last year's. After all, two of the 13
individual appropriations bills that finance the government have
already been signed into law, and four others have been sent to
Reagan for his signature.
   But with the presidential campaign influencing much of what
happens in Washington these days, and with the hopper stuffed with
legislation Congress wants to pass before leaving town next month,
a catchall spending bill may well be the result.

   When their party regained control of the
Senate two years ago, liberal Democrats placed at the top of their
agenda raising a minimum wage that President Reagan claimed had
``caused more misery and unemployment than anything since the Great
Depression.''
   With only seven weeks remaining until voters pick Reagan's
successor, his former running mate and GOP-designated heir, George
Bush, may have waffled just enough on the issue in the past two
weeks for Democrats to push through the first increase in the $3.35
an hour wage base in eight years.
   Labor Department figures indicate that a raise to $4.55 by 1991
as proposed by Senate Democrats would directly benefit some 15
million workers now paid less than that amount.
   Bush said again last Friday that he could support a modest
increase _ less than the $1.20 an hour over three years that
Democrats have agreed upon _ but only if it is coupled with a lower
``training wage.''

   While many lament the fires that have
charred much of Yellowstone National Park, a wilderness that went
up in smoke just one year ago already displays lush and diverse
greenery that attracts herds of elk.
   ``The fire created more wildlife habitat than anything we could
have ever done,'' Forest Ranger Morris Huffman said of the Deadwood
Summit fire in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in
the Boise National Forest.
   The fire 250 miles west of Yellowstone burned more than 50,000
acres during the summer of 1987.
   ``It's a natural mosaic now, with open meadows and stands of
timber,'' said forest spokesman Frank Carroll. ``A forest that was
just getting older and deader has now been beautifully revived.''

   In a scene repeated throughout
the country, ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe are crowding into
the village of Koenigstein in hopes of starting a new life in the
West.
   Nearly 500 recently arrived ethnic Germans are staying in
Koenigstein. They are just a small part of a record wave of 200,000
expected to arrive in West Germany this year.
   Most of them come from the Soviet Union and Poland, with smaller
numbers from Romania and other East European countries.
   Officially, the federal government welcomes the arrivals as
German citizens and praises the Soviet bloc's increased willingness
to permit their emigration centuries after their forebearers
settled in parts of Eastern Europe.
   But with Red Cross estimates saying the number will climb to
600,000 by the turn of the century, many towns and cities are
having trouble coping with the results of Bonn's open-door policy.

   Michael Jackson has moonwalked his way past Bill
Cosby to become the world's highest-paid entertainer, raking in an
estimated $60 million this year, Forbes magazine reports.
   Jackson, who was ranked ninth on last year's Forbes Top 40 list
of the wealthiest celebrities, is expected to earn a total of $97
million for 1987 and 1988, Forbes says in its Oct. 3 edition.
   The 30-year-old entertainer made approximately $40 million from
his recent worldwide tour, and the rest came from sales of his
album ``Bad,'' his autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' Pepsi endorsements
and other music publishing, the magazine says.
   The youngest entertainer on the list is 22-year-old heavyweight

<HEAD>Analysts: Hot-Selling Ford Probe May Be Creating Own Market Niche</HEAD>

   With little advertising and less fanfare, the
Ford Probe is speeding through dealer showrooms, keeping most
buyers waiting at least six weeks for delivery of a car that is
carving its own market niche.
   Since its formal introduction last May, the Probe, built beside
the Mazda MX-6 at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA Corp.'s Flat Rock
plant south of Detroit, is being sold three months in advance of
assembly line runs, Ford Motor Co. analyst Ray Windecker said.
   Delivery time can vary depending on particulars like color.
   The American car-buying public got a dose of what Ford had in
mind months before its formal introduction. The news media,
specifically the automotive magazines, sang the car's praises.
   ``By the time the cars were introduced, more than one-third of
the car-buying age populace was aware of the car,'' Windecker said.
   ``I don't think there's been that much excitement about a
domestic car since a Taurus,'' another Ford that was introduced in
December 1985, said Beth Fusco, an auto analyst with Moody's
Investor Services in New York City.
   ``They did a lot of advance promotion for the car in
magazines,'' she said. ``I thought that was a pretty sophisticated
send-off. I think they did a good job promoting it, and I think the
car is selling itself.''
   Probe's base price is $11,490 with a 2.2 liter, four-cylinder
engine. The car, with hidden headlamps and a swept-back rear deck,
can be upgraded with a turbocharged engine and option packages to
$17,292.
   Earlier this summer, scores of Probes reached the end of the
assembly line at Flat Rock needing repairs.
   Mazda quality control manager James G. Bouck said the quality
problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant _
a joint-venture between Ford and Mazda _ and some workers were
retrained and moved from one shift to another.
   Bouck, who moved to Mazda from General Motors Corp., said Mazda
has more stringent quality demands than some other automakers. That
can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped
to dealers.
   ``Our repair inventory is about 300 now,'' he said.
   Despite those problems, Probe sales have grown at a steady clip
_ about 600 cars more are sold each month than in the preceding
one. No one at Ford would reveal projected sales figures, but
Windecker said demand has outstripped those projections.
   It's too early to tell exactly where Probe will fit into the
American car market.
   ``They are creating a different niche for themselves,'' Fusco
said. But, she cautioned, ``I think you have to be really careful
when you're creating a niche.
   ``Look what GM did with Fiero,'' she said, referring to the
Pontiac two-seater that sold well in its first few years on the
market before falling off dramatically. GM stopped making the car
earlier this year.
   Analysts said the Probe has capitalized on the No. 2 and most
profitable automaker's strengths _ solid design, careful marketing
and reliability.
   ``They have done many things right,'' said Richard Henderson, an
analyst with the Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette in New York City. ``It's a combination of many, many
little factors, some borrowed from Europe, some from North America
and some borrowed from Mazda.
   ``Combine that with a nice fit in its product mix ... and you've
got a very successful car,'' Henderson said.
   Like other newly introduced cars, Probe's engineering initially
may take a back seat to its looks.
   ``What is there out there in that price range that looks that
neat?'' asked Fusco. ``I think people buy cars because they look
good, and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty
is good.''
   Like other Fords, Probe carries a one-year bumper-to-bumper
warranty and a six-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.
   Liz Dolan of the Center for Auto Safety, an industry watchdog
group in Washington, said no complaints about Probe have been
received, but she said the car is too new to the market have much
history, good or bad.
   Probe owner Michelle Aiken of Pleasant Hill, Calif., about 20
miles east of San Francisco, has no complaints about her Probe GT
Turbo.
   ``I love it,'' she said. ``It seems that I get places faster.
I'm used to driving a van. I thought I wouldn't care for it because
it was much smaller.''
   In addition to the Probe and the van, she and her husband, J.
Lee Aiken, also have a Chevrolet Corvette.
   The Probe, she said, is used for family transportation. Her two
children, ages 9 and 12, ``argue over who's going to sit in front.
We have to keep a chart on our refrigerator'' so the children know
whose turn it is.

<HEAD>Japan Stockpiling Oil Despite Gulf Truce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has increased its
crude oil stockpile despite the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war and
a world oil glut, a senior Japanese oil executive said Sunday.
   Japan has 170 million barrels of oil stockpiled now and plans to
boost that to 190 million by the end of next March, said Toshikaza
Hashimoto, President of Japan's National Oil Corp.
   Hashimoto, the leader of a Japanese energy delegation touring
the Middle East, said Japan's crude oil demand for the next 10
years would swell to 3.4 million to 3.5 million barrels a day.
   Japan has no oil resources and ranks third among the world's oil
importing countries. Its oil stockpile is enough to meet
consumption for 140 days, Hashimoto disclosed.
   Asked about the need for such a large stockpile, he said: ``The
private sector is required by law to keep such a stockpile.'' He
also cited ``the government's financial situation,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Gulf oil covers 68 percent of Japan's current oil needs,
Hashimoto said.
   Asked if Japan will increase those imports now that a United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire has restored some stability to the
region after eight years of war, he said: ``This depends on supply
and demand.''
   Hashimoto is leading a Japanese energy delegation which also
will visit Oman, Egypt and Saudi Arabia for talks on oil-related
issues.

<HEAD>Village Voice Publisher To Give NYU $25 Million Gift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Leonard Stern plans to donate $25
million to New York University, the largest single gift ever made
to the university, Crain's New York Business reported Sunday.
   The money will be used to move the NYU business school from its
current quarters near Wall Street in lower Manhattan to a new
facility at the university's Greenwich Village campus, the business
news magazine stated.
   The graduate business school will be named after Stern, 50, who
earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in business from New
York University.
   Stern owns the Village Voice and a new newspaper, Manhattan,
which recently expanded from a weekly newspaper to publishing seven
days a week. He is chairman of the Hartz Group, which includes
Hartz Mountain pet products of Secaucus, N.J.
   Crain's said a formal announcement about the donation would be
made after negotiations ``on the scope and function of the gift,
now under discussion, are concluded.''
   Crain's said it would be the largest gift ever made to the
university. A spokesman for the university could not be reached for
comment Sunday.

<HEAD>Zenith Dissidents: We Won't Meet With Company Execs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of dissident shareholders stated Sunday
it would not meet with the Zenith Electronics Corp. board of
directors and repeated a pledge to try to dump directors and sell
the company.
   ``I don't think you need to go in and explain it,'' Peter C.
Harkins of Brookhurst Partners Limited Partnership said of a
meeting with Zenith. ``We've given them a specific proposal to
enhance shareholder value: sell Zenith Electronics Corp.''
   On Friday, Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman invited Brookhurst
Partners, which has a 6.1 percent stake in Zenith, to a Sept. 26
board meeting, apparently to discuss the dissidents' desire to get
new directors and sell the company.
   But in a letter to Pearlman made public Sunday, Brookhurst
Partners rejected the request for a meeting. The letter said Zenith
had waited too long to improve the company's bottom line, so a sale
makes sense.
   ``It is the responsibility of the board and management to
formulate a plan to enhance Zenith share value,'' the letter says.
``After 3{ years of multimillion-dollar losses, shareowners are
still waiting for the details of your plan.''
   If Zenith does not put iself on the market, Brookhurst Partners
wants other shareholders to vote in favor of trimming the board
from 10 directors to six, retaining three directors and electing
three Brookhurst nominees.
   ``Our nominees will then be pledged to sell the company,''
Harkins, Brookhurst Partners general counsel, said from New York.
   Zenith was closed Sunday and spokesman John Taylor could not be
reached for comment on the letter.
   In order to depose directors, Brookhurst Partners is asking a
federal judge in Delaware to strike a company bylaw that says all
shareholders _ not just a majority _ must favor such a move.
   Based on its 26 million common shares outstanding, and a closing
stock price of $21.75 a share on Friday, Zenith would have a market
value of more than $565 million.
   Brookhurst Partners, formed by Herbert B. Abelow and Nicholas L.
Ihasz, contends the bylaw is illegal. Zenith, a Delaware-chartered
corporation, is based in Glenview, north of Chicago.
   Pearlman has said repeatedly since April that the board was
``exploring all options'' for returning the company to
profitability.
   Zenith, the last remaining U.S. television manufacturer, has
been fighting a losing battle against low-priced imported
televisions.
   Despite the success of its highly regarded computers, Zenith
suffered losses over the past three years, including $19.1 million
last year on sales of $2.36 billion.
   ``We've spoken to major shareholders and they've shared our
views,'' Harkins said of the plan to sell the company.

<TEXT>
   Fred D. Thompson, a former vice president of the
New York Times and assistant to the president of the Times Co.,
died of a heart attack while vacationing in Europe. He was 72.
   Thompson, who died Saturday in Fort William, Scotland, was a
Manhattan resident.
   Thompson joined the Times in 1971 after the company bought
Family Circle magazine. He had been president and chief executive
of the magazine since 1969, and remained in those positions until
1975 when he was named the Times' vice president for advertising.
   ``Fred Thompson made a major contribution to the New York Times
during the period in which the Times was being expanded and new
daily sections were being introduced,'' said Walter Mattson,
president of the Times Co.
   In 1979, Thompson was appointed Mattson's assistant, a position
he held until his retirement the following year.
   Earlier in his career, Thompson had held executive positions
with Reader's Digest.
   Thompson was a native of San Antonio, Texas, and moved to New
York with his family when he was 14.
   Survivors include his wife, Julia; four sons; a daughter; and
six grandchildren.
