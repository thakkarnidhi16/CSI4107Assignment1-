<HEAD>Opposition Leader Says Guatemala Lagging On Peace Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An opposition leader who was arrested when
she returned from exile said Friday that Guatemala is lagging
behind other Central American nations in seeking peace with rebels.
   Rigoberta Menchu and another activist were arrested Monday, then
released after being held for seven hours. She returned to exile in
Rome on Friday.
   Despite her arrest, Ms. Menchu said she moved freely during her
stay here, despite periodic death threats that she called ``normal
and of not much importance.''
   She said she and three other members of the leftist United
Representation of Guatemalan had discussed with Roman Catholic
Archbishop Prespero Penados del Barrio whether exiles can safely
return to Guatemala. ``We had great success,'' she said at the
airport before departing for Rome, but gave no details.
   Travel plans of the the other exiles, Rolando Castillo Montalvo,
Frank La Rue and Marta de Torres, were not known.
   Ms. Menchu and Castillo Montalvo were arrested and charged with
crimes ``against the internal security of the nation,'' but a judge
subsequently dismissed the charges for lack of evidence.
   Speaking with reporters at the airport, Ms. Menchu said
Guatemala is far from meeting provisions of a Central American
peace plan signed Aug. 7 by the presidents of Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica.
   ``I believe that this process still is just beginning to begin
(in Guatemala) because ... in other countries of the Central
American region there have been more concrete things, there have
been more realistic things than there have been in our country,''
she said.

<HEAD>Radio Says Bofors Bribed Indian Family for Weapons Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swedish radio said Friday it had
obtained documents supporting allegations that a family of Indian
financiers received $13.7 million in connection with a Swedish arms
sale to India.
   It said the documents included telex messages between the
Swedish firm AB Bofors and two Swiss banks in Geneva in 1986
dealing with accounts under the control of London-based members of
the Hinduja family.
   In New Delhi, the newspaper Hindu also reported the allegations.
   G. P. Hinduja, one of four brothers active in the family
operations, called the information ``a complete fabrication'' in a
statement to the Hindu. Bofors spokesman Per Mossberg was quoted as
denying the allegations.
   The telex messages indicated the account holder was promised a
10 percent commission on a $1.4 billion Indian contract for 155mm
howitzers made by Bofors, Sweden's largest arms manufacturer, the
Swedish radio said.
   It described the Hindujas as being close to Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi and his Congress Party.
   The broadcast said money from Bofors passed through accounts
held by the Hinduja family at the British Bank of the Middle East
and the Continental Illinois Bank in Geneva. It claimed the
deposits were transferred to Sangam Ltd. in London, a company
Swedish radio said was owned by the Hinduja family.
   Gandhi's government was facing allegations of corruption when it
negotiated the deal with Bofors in 1986 and made the condition that
no middlemen be used. A Swedish investigation last June found that
Bofors paid up to $40 million to individuals, but the company
legally blocked access to further information.
   In New Delhi, a Parliament committee dealing with the case
adopted its final report Friday, but the United News of India said
investigators had ``drawn a blank.''
   The report was not made public. It is to be presented to
Parliament next Friday.
   Gandhi pledged anew that the government would punish any Indian
who profited from the deal illegally, UNI said. He was in Madras
for a two-day Congress Party meeting.

   Marines who landed on an
Iranian oil platform after it was battered by U.S. warships found
weapons that may have been used against American helicopters, the
commander of the attack said.
   Capt. James B. Perkins III, who heads Destroyer Squadron 9, said
the attack on the Sassan oil platform bore out U.S. claims that the
Persian Gulf facility was being used for military purposes.
   ``We believe that Sassan was a communications and surveillence
station,'' said Perkins. ``We found weapons, ammunition and
communications gear.''
   Sassan, one of two Iranian oil rigs attacked by U.S. forces on
Monday, was destroyed in an operation that began with a two-ship
naval bombardment followed by a helicopter assault. It ended with
an assault by Marine Corps. demolition specialists who blew up the
remaining facilities.
   ``We've gotten pretty beat up for our combined operations in the
past ... but I thought this was just about perfect,'' Perkins said
during an interview on the bridge of this San Diego-based warship.
   Perkins declined to speculate on how the Iranians used Sassan,
other than for surveillance of shipping, but an officer aboard this
destroyer said the weapons recovered were types associated with
Iran's armed speedboat operations in the gulf.
   After the shelling, the Marines who assaulted the platform found
23mm guns, primarily anti-aircraft weapons.
   Officers said it was most likely one of those weapons fired on
two helicopters from the guided missile frigate Simpson on March 5.
   Although the helicopters were not hit, the incident was cited by
U.S. officials as one of the reasons for Operation Praying Mantis.
Another reason was the mining of the frigate Samuel B. Roberts on
April 14.
   The 4,500-ton McCormick, a guided-missile destroyer brought into
the gulf from its battle group station in the Arabian Sea, and the
7,818-ton destroyer Merrill fired 133 5-inch shells at the platform.
   Perkins said that at Sassan, ``the destruction was complete. It
was pretty beat up by the naval gunfire, and the demolition charges
made one hell of an explosion.
   ``It was obscured in smoke and flame. It's certainly
uninhabitable at this point.''
   Perkins' unit gave the Iranians at Sassan a five-minute warning
that they were about to be attacked.
   About 29 workers on the platform quickly boarded two tugboats
that were tied up under the living quarters platform at Sassan and
got out of the way.
   Some Iranians who had stayed behind fired at the McCormick and
the Merrill with one of three Soviet-made 23mm guns placed on the
three-tiered, southernmost deck.
   Although the twin-barrelled weapon has a range of four miles,
the rounds fell short of the ships, which were about two miles from
the platform.
   Perkins said one of the tugboats radioed for permission to
return to the platform and pick up another group of about 38 still
aboard. The request was granted and a 45-minute evacuation took
place while the ships held their fire.
   Radio traffic indicated only two Iranian casualties at Sassan,
one dead and one wounded, but U.S. officers said there may have
been more.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Meese Should Stay In Office, Helps Fill Key Vacancy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is moving to fill one Justice
Department slot and Attorney General Edwin Meese III is appointing
temporary replacements for up to a dozen others in an attempt to
end the turmoil caused by the March 29 protest resignations of two
key Meese aides.
   Reagan on Friday moved quickly to ease Meese's personnel
problems by nominating Francis Keating to fill the associate
attorney general's slot, the department's empty No. 3 post.
   Reagan also said Meese should stay in office and the Justice
Department is running ``just fine,'' although two top Meese aides
who quit told Reagan on Wednesday a ``deep malaise'' had
``infected'' the department and one of them said Meese should be
indicted.
   Keating would replace Stephen Trott, who left the department a
week ago to become a federal judge. His was not one of the protest
resignations, but the vacancy has been affected by the concern with
Meese's leadership.
   Keating, an assistant Treasury secretary, may come in to the
Justice Department on an acting basis late next week until he can
be confirmed by the Senate.
   The Nos. 2 and 3 offices at the Justice Department are virtually
vacant from the top down, and the department plans to shore them up
by naming perhaps nearly a dozen people in all, department
spokesman Patrick Korten said. The posts probably will be filled on
Monday.
   Korten added, ``Meese absolutely has no intention of stepping
down.''
   An independent counsel has been examining Meese's assistance to
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. and a proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline project at the behest of longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach. Also under investigation are Meese's meetings with
regional Bell telephone company executives at a time when he owned
$14,000 in Baby Bell stock and Wallach's role in securing a
$40,000-a-year job for Meese's wife.
   Since the protest resignations of Deputy Attorney General Arnold
Burns and Assistant Attorney General William Weld, Meese has twice
unsuccessfully tried to fill Burns' post.
   Philadelphia lawyer Arlin Adams rejected Meese's overtures, and
at least five current or former U.S. attorneys who have been
sounded out about Weld's job have said they weren't interested. St.
Louis attorney John Shepherd withdrew from consideration for Burns'
post Wednesday after adverse publicity about an alleged affair with
his law firm's bookkeeper and other matters.
   Weld was ``unequivocal'' at the White House meeting in telling
the president that if it were up to him, he would seek an
indictment of Meese, said an administration source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The former criminal division chief then proceeded to lay out
``an oral indictment'' of Meese to the president, said the source,
focusing on Meese's relationship with Wallach.
   Wallach is under indictment in the Wedtech scandal.
   The administration source said Burns told the president that
Meese had violated the standards of ethical conduct for executive
branch employees spelled out in a 1965 executive order.
   Burns, according to the source, said that in other similar
instances of possible impropriety, Justice Department lawyers would
be placed on administrative leave, disciplined or dismissed.
   ``The president was very attentive,'' said the source, adding
that ``it was clear he was hearing for the first time that not
everything is well in Denmark.''
   The ethical standards say employees should avoid any action
which could create the appearance of using public office for
private gain, giving preferential treatment to any organization or
person or making a government decision outside official channels.
   Vice President George Bush, Baker and White House counsel A.B.
Culvahouse also attended the meeting.
   Meese was summoned to a 40-minute meeting with Reagan
immediately afterward.
   According to Korten, the president told Meese at the end of
their meeting that he was ``satisfied and supportive'' of the
attorney general.
   Burns left his post officially on Friday, 3{ weeks after
resigning to protest Meese's continued tenure as attorney general.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay, who has been conducting a
criminal investigation of Meese since last May 11, is expected to
issue a report of Meese's activites if he doesn't seek an
indictment of the attorney general.
   It is likely the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility will then examine ethical questions raised as a
result of McKay's probe and will recommend to Reagan whether Meese
should be disciplined or fired.

   A mammogram of Nancy Reagan's right breast
shows no sign of cancer, the White House says.
   While the first lady went to Bethesda Naval Hospital to have her
six-month checkup following removal of her cancerous left breast,
President Reagan had dental X-rays done there.
   The first couple flew by helicopter Friday to the suburban
Maryland military facility from the White House, remained there for
less than a half-hour, then went to Camp David for the weekend.
   ``The president and first lady completed their routine
radiological procedures,'' White House physician Dr. John Hutton
said.
   ``The president had a series of routine dental X-rays in the
dental clinic, while Mrs. Reagan had her first post-operative
mammogram,'' he said. ``The mammogram was negative. No immediate
treatment of any kind is required as a result of today's procedures
on the president and first lady.''
   The White House had said earlier that the examinations were not
prompted by any current physicial problems of either of the Reagans.
   The Reagans did not answer reporters' questions when they left
the White House or on arrival or departure from the hospital.
   Reagan, however, made an ``A-OK'' thumb-and-forefinger sign,
indicating things went well.
   The last time the 77-year-old president visited the hospital was
in January, when he underwent his semi-annual checkup for colon
cancer. He has had regular checkups every January and June since he
underwent surgery for an intestinal malignancy in July 1985.
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, said, ``It's wise
and routine to check the other breast'' after surgery of the kind
the first lady had six months ago.
   She said the first lady has had periodic examinations since her
operation Oct. 17, 1987, but this was her first X-ray of the right
breast.
   Mrs. Crispen said the couple wanted to have the results of Mrs.
Reagan's exam promptly ``so they could send her off for a
comfortable, worry-free weekend.''
   Mrs. Reagan, 66, had her breast removed after doctors discovered
a quarter-inch cancerous lesion. She chose to undergo a modified
radical mastectomy, which involves the removal of the entire breast
and some lymph nodes.
   Mrs. Crispen said that not only was it time for the first lady's
six-month checkup, but the president could use the time ``to get
his dental X-rays taken, rather than usually doing it at the White
House.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan usually has a
cleaning and checkup every three months at the White House, but
that the president planned to have a ``panoramic'' X-ray done this
time in order to get a full-view picture of his mouth.
   The White House has X-ray machines that take pictures of parts
of the mouth, but does not have the larger machine that pans the
entire mouth area, he said.
   Panoramic radiographs, or X-rays that provide an overall view of
the teeth and jaws, are used to diagnose problems ranging from
cavities to tumors.

<HEAD>Top Administration Officials Called To Testify Against North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A host of current and former top government
officials are listed as prosecution witnesses for the Iran-Contra
conspiracy trial of Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and three
co-defendants.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and two top deputies and
Attorney Edwin Meese III and two of his top aides are among the
list of 105 witnesses submitted in a court filing Friday by
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.
   The list includes national security officials knowledgeable
about the covert sale of U.S. arms to Iran, private operatives who
ran the secret supply network that armed the Nicaraguan rebels,
Contra leaders and wealthy donors who contributed to their cause.
   No date has been set for the trial of North, former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter and two arms dealers: retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.
   They are accused of conspiring to divert profits illegally from
the U.S.-Iran arms sales to help the Contras during a ban on direct
American military aid to the rebels.
   Walsh filed the witness list in advance of Monday's hearing
called by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to determine if
prosecutors impermissibly relied on evidence derived from the
compelled congressional testimony of North, Hakim and Poindexter.
   Most of the witnesses were known to Walsh before Hakim received
congressional immunity on April 20, 1987.
   The list includes deputy CIA director Robert Gates, former White
House chief of staff Donald Regan, former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane and assistant attorneys general William Bradford
Reynolds and Charles Cooper.
   Meese, Cooper, and Reynolds would be expected to testify about
the November 1986 investigation they conducted that uncovered the
diversion of arms-sale profits.
   The defense, meanwhile, indicated that it will call Reynolds as
a witness during the hearing on the immunity question. The defense
wants to show that statements he made to the grand jury were
influenced by the defendants' compelled congressional testimony,
according to court papers.
   Late Friday, Gesell issued an order blocking a defense attempt
to subpoena nine members of Walsh's staff to testify at the hearing.
   Seven of the prospective trial witnesses are referred to only by
number ``because of national security concerns,'' Walsh said. Their
identities were given privately to the court and the defense.
   Other top officials on the list include Assistant Secretary of
State Elliott Abrams, State Department legal adviser Abraham Sofaer
and former CIA general counsel Stanley Sporkin, now a federal judge
here.
   McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of
withholding information from Congress about covert aid to the
Contras, is one of several former National Security Council
officials on the list, which includes North's former secretary Fawn
Hall.
   Contra leaders Adolfo Calero and Luis Alfonse Robelo are listed
along with retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, who helped raise
private money for the anti-Sandinista cause.
   Donors Ellen Garwood, William O'Boyle, and C. Thomas Claggett,
Jr. are listed along with William Haskell, who owned land in
Central America where an airstrip was built for resupply operations.
   Also on the list were two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R.
``Spitz'' Channell and Richard Miller. Channell and Miller pleaded
guilty last year to conspiring illegally to use a tax-exempt
foundation to help raise Contra money.
   The defense indicated it also wanted to call Secord and former
National Security Council aide Kenneth deGraffenreid as witnesses
at next week's hearing.
   Walsh's office moved to disqualify the defense from calling any
witnesses on the ground that the lawyers did not meet Thursday's
deadline for notifying the prosecution of the grand jury witness
they intended to produce at the hearing.
   The prosecutor also argued that deGraffenreid and Secord weren't
grand jury witnesses and therefore couldn't testify at next week's
hearing.
   The defense apparently wants to put Secord on the witness stand
to show that testimony he gave to Congress, without immunity, was
based on information he received from Hakim, who gave closed-door
testimony to the congressional committees before the public
hearings began last spring.

<HEAD>Accutane Maker Will Devise New Safeguards On Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of a popular anti-acne medication
that can cause birth defects says it will try once again to devise
a way to keep women from taking the prescription drug if they are
pregnant or likely to become pregnant.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has convened an
advisory panel next Tuesday to consider reports that more pregnant
women than previously believed are taking the drug Accutane despite
strict warnings that it is likely to cause birth defects.
   Short of an outright ban, the agency has no way to guarantee the
drug will not be used by women who are pregnant or become pregnant
while taking it. And there was no indication whether the FDA was
actively considering ordering it off the market.
   The New Jersey-based maker _ Roche Laboratories _ issued a
statement late Friday saying it will propose a new series of
safeguards at the Tuesday meeting.
   It said it will propose tighter restrictions on use of the drug
in women of childbearing potential and offer to provide
``innovative blister-packaging to ensure that female patients
receive the pregnancy warning with every prescription.''
   The statement did not detail what type of restrictions the
company will propose for the drug in the United States. The drug is
marketed in 40 countries worldwide.
   The warnings accompanying the drug since its introduction in the
United States in 1982 are explicit: Don't take the drug if you are
pregnant and don't get pregnant while you are taking it.
   FDA spokesman Don McLearn said Friday the agency's dermatologic
drugs advisory committee has been asked to review use of Accutrane
because ``we're concerned that a drug is not being used as the
labeling indicates.''
   ``The drug has all sorts of warnings that people who are
pregnant should not be using it and that the drug is only for a
very severe form of acne,'' said McLearn. ``It's clear that it's
being used for a larger group than that.''
   Dr. Robert Stern, a dermatologist from Beth Israel Hospital in
Boston and a member of the advisory panel, emphasized that concern
about the drug does not involve any new scientific discoveries, but
rather new indications that some people are ignoring long-standing
warnings of those effects.
   He said in a telephone interview Friday that the newly raised
concern flows from a study of Michigan Medicaid figures that
suggests the frequency of people getting pregnant while on Accutane
may be ``much higher than anybody thought it was.''
   However, Stern said he has substantial questions about the
accuracy of the projected pregnancy rate, since it was based on a
``very specialized population, namely people who are already on Aid
to Families With Dependent Children because of prior unintended
pregnancies.''
   The question, he said, is not whether there is a problem, but
how great the problem is for the estimated 1 million people _ a
majority of them men _ who benefit from the drug.
   The Michigan statistical projection says Accutane may have
caused more than 1,000 babies to be born with birth defects in the
past six years.
   The FDA has received reports of 62 birth defects associated with
the drug from the time it came on the market in 1982, but
scientists believe that may understate the problem simply because
many side effects from any drug often are unrecognized and
under-reported.
   Accutane is specifically intended for treatment of severe cystic
acne, a type that often causes severe disfiguring and deep pitting
scars and sometimes can be treated only with Accutane.
   Since the drug was approved in 1982, the FDA and Roche _ a
division of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. _ have strengthened the warning
label, made repeated mailings of special letters to doctors and
pharmacists emphasizing the risks and discussed the risks twice in
the FDA Drug Bulletin that is sent to more than 1 million health
professionals.
   They also have distributed red warning stickers to pharmacists
to be placed on each prescription bottle.

<HEAD>Sample Taken For Dating of Shroud Venerated As Christ's Burial
Cloth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tiny sample has been cut from the Shroud
of Turin for radiocarbon-dating that may determine whether the
cloth existed at the time of Christ's death on the cross, the
Vatican announced.
   The linen, which appears to bear the image of a crucified man,
is venerated by some as Christ's burial cloth.
   The operation, eagerly awaited by scientists, was carried out
Thursday in Turin under the supervision of Cardinal Anastasio
Ballestrero, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Turin, Italy, with
the collaboration of Dr. Michael Tite of the British Museum, the
Vatican said.
   The British Museum has agreed to guarantee the scientific
validity of the carbon-dating, which is to be done independently on
nuclear atom-counters at Oxford, the University of Arizona and the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at the University of Zurich.
   The Vatican, which owns the shroud, had resisted carbon-dating
on grounds it would damage the cloth, which is 14 feet, 3 inches
long and 3 feet, 7 inches wide. But the development in the 1970s of
an atom-counter known as an accelerator mass spectrometer made it
possible to date objects with much smaller samples.
   The shroud, whose history is well-documented from the mid-14th
century, has been kept in the Turin Cathedral since 1578.
   A piece of cloth measuring just 1 centimeter by 7 centimeters
(four-tenths of an inch by 2.8 inches) was cut from the shroud,
then cut further into three samples for the laboratories, Friday's
Vatican announcement said.
   The size of the individual samples was not given, but Tite has
previously said each laboratory would receive a 0.3-square-inch
sample of the shroud.
   The Vatican said the area of cutting was chosen to guarantee
that the sample belongs to the principal body of the shroud and
that the cut would cause ``the least damage possible to the cloth.''
   It said the entire operation was videotaped and photographed.
   Each laboratory will also receive two dummy cloth samples, one
carbon-dated and the other dated historically but not
scientifically to see if they get consistent results for all three
samples. The labs are not being told which sample is from the
shroud, the Vatican said.
   Tite has said the triple carbon-dating should reveal the
shroud's age within a 200-year range. The results are expected to
be announced by summer.
   The tests will not prove that the image on the cloth is
Christ's, but would indicate whether the shroud existed when Christ
was crucified.
   The shroud bears a faint yellowish image of both the front and
back of a man's body. Stains, scientifically identified as blood,
can be seen around the wrists.
   Believers contend the image was left by a supernatural burst of
energy accompanying Christ's resurrection, while skeptics claim it
was painted during the Middle Ages.

   Nearly 2,500 photographs from the Robert F.
Kennedy assassination file were destroyed because they were
unneeded duplicates that took up filing space, a police spokesman
says.
   Commander Bill Booth, responding to questions about the
destruction disclosed earlier this week, said Friday the
explanation came from a retired police officer who was very
involved in the case.
   He declined to give the officer's name, saying, ``He has been
retired for some time and is disinclined to get involved.''
   But he said the man ``has an independent recollection'' of
events relating to the pictures.
   In the aftermath of Kennedy's assassination at the Ambassador
Hotel on June 5, 1968, he said, police took photographs of every
possible angle of the crime scene.
   ``What happened is there were many hundreds of photographs
taken, thousands of photographs,'' Booth said. ``And many copies of
each photograph were copied for us and for each agency involved.''
   ``What were destroyed were superfluous duplicates that amounted
to a lot of redundancy,'' he said. ``There was no need to keep
them. Filing space was a consideration.''
   The police department's voluminous file on the Kennedy
assassination was released for the first time Tuesday, and
California Archivist John Burns noted a certificate showing that
2,410 photographs were burned by police two months after Kennedy's
death.
   Police earlier had conceded they destroyed ceiling panels and
part of a door jamb from the kitchen of the Ambassador that became
central to investigation of whether a second gun might have been
fired at the New York senator.
   Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian immigrant, was convicted of murdering
Kennedy and is serving a life term at Soledad Prison. He has said
he was the lone assassin but insists he has no memory of the actual
shooting. He blames alcohol for his amnesia.
   In another development, the woman who told police in 1968 that
she saw a girl in a polka-dot dress run from the assassination
scene declared she had been badgered into recanting her original
story.
   The newly released police files showed that Sandra Serrano
withdrew her statement two weeks after the killing, saying, ``The
whole thing was a lie.''
   But the woman, now Sandra Serrano-Sewell, told a radio reporter
Thursday that she was a victim of police harassment.
   She had reported seeing a girl in a polka dot dress running from
the Ambassador Hotel shouting, ``We shot him. We shot him.'' When
she asked who was shot, she said the woman replied, ``Senator
Kennedy.''
   But her retraction of the story led police to cancel a search
for such a girl, the files showed.
   In an interview with KUOP Radio in Stockton, Ms. Serrano-Sewell
said, ``There was a lot of badgering that was going on. I was just
20 years old, and I became unglued. ... I said what they wanted me
to say.''
   Asked on Friday about the woman's statements, Booth said, ``Our
conclusion was she did not tell the truth when she gave all that
information. ... The files have to speak for themselves.''

   Deaf actress Marlee Matlin says she's unhappy
with the way The New York Times treated her decision to speak
without using sign language on the Academy Awards program.
   The Times' article on April 13 said some people viewed her
appearance earlier this month as ``a blow not only to deaf people
but also to the goal of `total communication.'''
   ``I do not sign and speak simultaneously, and when I chose to
sign alone (with an off-camera voice) or to speak alone, as I did
on the Oscar ceremony telecast, I could have potentially ignored
two major segments of the deaf community _ those who use speech and
do not sign and those who sign and do not use speech,'' she wrote
in a letter to the newspaper published Friday.
   ``Fortunately, the telecast was closed captioned ... and
everyone, regardless of communication preference, had access. So
what's the big fuss?'' The star of ``Children of a Lesser God''
closed her letter with a complimentary P.S.: ``But thank you for
the nice picture.''

   Patrick Kennedy, the youngest son of Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., underwent surgery to have a non-cancerous
tumor removed from the top of his spine and was reported in ``very
satisfactory'' condition.
   Kennedy, 20, was admitted Monday to Massachusetts General
Hospital after complaining of headaches and back pains.
   The operation Thursday was without complication and Kennedy, a
sophomore at Providence College, was expected to make a complete
recovery, said Kennedy spokesman Jeff Smith in Washington.
   Kennedy will be a Rhode Island delegate to the Democratic
National Convention in July. Like his father, he is backing Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis. He is also working on his father's re-election
campaign.

   A decision to award an honorary degree
to Sen. Strom Thurmond has upset some faculty members and students
at predominantly black South Carolina State College.
   ``It's not just his old past, it's his recent past. Every single
civil rights bill since 1957 he has opposed. Right up to two weeks
ago, when he voted against the recent civil rights bill,'' said
history Professor William Hine.
   The college's board of trustees decided in February to give the
honorary doctorate of laws degree to the conservative South
Carolina Republican during graduation May 8, school President
Albert Smith said.
   Four petitions are circulating among the faculty calling for the
degree not to be awarded, Hine said, and students are talking about
boycotting graduation ceremonies.
   Thurmond will accept the award but will be out of the country on
a classified trip with the Senate Armed Services Committee, press
secretary Chris Simpson said.

   Eddie Albert says he may have overindulged at
his 80th birthday party, but normally he's more restrained.
   ``I'm happy to be alive. I've had three pieces of cake but
otherwise I'm looking after my health,'' Albert said Friday.
   Albert, the star of the television shows ``Green Acres'' and
``Switch,'' was awakened by his granddaughter, Mia, who serenaded
him with ``Happy Birthday, Poppy,'' said publicist Barry Landau.
   The actor's daughter, Maria, was with him Friday but his son,
actor Edward Albert, was in Mexico City filming the feature movie
``Fistfighter.'' He called with his greetings Wednesday night.
   Albert appeared in several episodes of ``Falcon Crest'' this
season. His son also had a recurring role on the series.

the United States, took in some Texas-style entertainment _
barbeque, broncos and bullriding.
   The queen arrived at the Mesquite Rodeo on Friday in a crimson
western-style fringe dress, a giant white hat, and gold lizard skin
boots. The king opted for a casual look of a checkered sports
jacket and tassled loafers and hat. He also woore an engraved belt
buckle the size of a fist.
   Before the rodeo, they ate barbecue under a yellow-striped tent.
   ``We had a glimpse of (rodeo) in Calgary the other day. It will

the king said.
   A crowd of about 4,000 people cheered as the flag of Sweden was
introduced and again when the queen and king were presented.

   A reporter and a photographer from a
Florida newspaper were detained for about two hours Friday after
the Coast Guard said their rented boat entered a restricted area
near a submarine shipyard.
   The reporter denied that the small boat had entered the
restricted waters, which extend 100 feet into the Thames River from
the Electric Boat Shipyard, where submarines including
nuclear-powered Tridents are built.
   The boat, rented by photographer Stanley Badz and reporter
Michael Romaner of the Jacksonville Times-Union, was stopped and
boarded after it was spotted within the restricted area, said Coast
Guard Lt. Cmdr. James Rutkovsky.
   Also aboard the 18-to-20-foot vessel was Kenneth Zelvin, a
Groton businessman who rents boats, Rutkovsky said.
   ``We didn't know what we had. We didn't know if we had
terrorists, criminals or what,'' said Rutkovsky.
   Rutkovsky said officials were concerned because the Trident
submarine Pennsylvania was being prepared for a launch Saturday.
   The three men denied being in the restricted zone, but were
taken to Coast Guard headquarters while their stories and
identities were checked, Rutkovsky said. The procedure took about
two hours, and in the end no charges were filed, he said.
   ``We weren't anywhere near 100 feet, we weren't even within 200
feet,'' Romaner said. ``You can't even get a Trident into the
camera lens from that close.''
   A Navy intelligence officer was called in and confiscated the
photographer's film. Rutkovsky said if no sensitive portions of the
shipyard were found on the film it would be returned to the
newspaper.
   The newsmen objected to the confiscation and the newspaper's
executive editor, Fred Hartmann, tried to stop the confiscation in
a telephone call to the Coast Guard, Romaner said.

<HEAD>Congress Weighing Safety Changes Year After Building Collapse
Killed 28</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The concrete and steel rubble from L'Ambiance
Plaza has long been cleared away, but the impact of the decade's
most devastating construction accident still is being felt in
Congress.
   Lawmakers have been pushing for changes in construction-safety
laws since the partially built Bridgeport, Conn., apartment complex
collapsed one year ago today, leaving 28 workers dead.
   Proposals have ranged from tinkering with the accident reporting
requirements and stiffening criminal penalties in fatal
construction accidents to creating a separate construction agency
outside the often-criticized Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.
   ``Obviously the price is too high in all the lives lost to ever
think of it as having a silver lining,'' said Rep. Bruce A.
Morrison, D-Conn. ``But given that all of that can't be changed, I
do think it can be used ... to remind people in Congress and remind
people in OSHA'' of problems in the construction industry.
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who was a state representative
when L'Ambiance collapsed, has devoted much of his time to the
accident since coming to Congress to replace the late Rep. Stewart
B. McKinney. But the freshman congressman is frustrated at the
slow-moving gears of Congress.
   ``Like most victims of crimes, you have the victims of
L'Ambiance who are seeing a fairly unresponsive government, or at
least a government that has responded slowly,'' Shays said in an
interview this week.
   Morrison said he is drafting legislation to increase criminal
penalties for contractors convicted in fatal construction
accidents. The current maximum penalty is six months in prison and
a $10,000 fine for willful violation of OSHA standards.
   At the request of lawmakers, OSHA is reviewing whether to change
its reporting standards. Under current regulations, only accidents
with a death or at least five injuries have to be reported.
   OSHA critics point to an accident in Stamford, Conn., shortly
before the L'Ambiance collapse that involved the same contractor
and the same type of problem that investigators say triggered the
Bridgeport accident. But the Stamford accident went unreported
because only one worker was injured.
   Morrison, who labeled the current reporting requirements
``absurd,'' believes knowledge of the Stamford accident could have
prevented L'Ambiance.
   OSHA spokesman Terry Mikelson said the reporting requirement is
still under review.
   The agency also is reviewing its regulations on the lift-slab
construction method used by L'Ambiance builders that was implicated
in the collapse.
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., is pushing a measure that
would put the L'Ambiance fines in a special trust fund for the
victims' families. Weicker fears the heavy fines will drive the
contractors into bankruptcy, making them unable to pay damages that
could be awarded in pending civil suits.
   Some lawmakers are embracing the idea of making a separate
construction division within OSHA, while the AFL-CIO wants to
create a separate construction agency. Congressional supporters
said, however, that they do not expect action this year.
   Jim Lapping, director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO
Building and Construction Trades Department, said he does not hold
out hope for significant changes because of L'Ambiance.
   ``In '78 we had the Willow Island (cooling tower) accident (in
West Virginia) and we had 51 people killed there and nothing came
out of that,'' Lapping said.
   Such criticism of OSHA was reignited by the Bridgeport collapse,
with charges that the agency has too few inspectors and relies too
heavily on industry self-regulation.
   But OSHA officials defend their policing policies.
   ``If Congress, in its vision when it imagined what OSHA would be
like, wanted an inspector on every job site 24 hours a day, it
would have said so,'' said spokesman Mikelson. ``It made employers
accountable for safety and health, knowing full well the government
wouldn't have inspectors at every site in the country.''
   Mikelson also said OSHA has made changes in recent years,
including imposing heavier fines such as those at L'Ambiance and
severely penalizing project contractors when they fail to properly
oversee subcontractors.
   ``The bottom line is when employers show a strong commitment to
safety and health, workers sustain far fewer injures,'' he said.

   Henry ``Butch'' Miller couldn't make much

owe his life to the car whose taillights he followed before landing
his disabled airplane.
   Miller, 39, of Coopersville, safely landed his six-passenger
Aerostar 600 about 10 p.m. Thursday on the northbound lane of
Michigan 40 about two miles north of here.
   ``At night, it's very hard to pick out roads, if not
impossible,'' he said. ``Basically I chased the taillights. Whoever

   The driver of the car had not been identified by late Friday,
said Deputy Susan Baker of the Allegan County Sheriff's Department.
   Miller, the defending American Speed Association stock car
racing champion, said he was en route from Huntington, Ind., to
Muskegon when the plane's right engine blew a gasket and he had to
make an emergency landing.

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are battling gently for the
Democratic presidential nomination, trading good-natured jibes
about a running mate and saving their potshots for Republican Vice
President George Bush.
   Going into the final weekend before Pennsylvania's primary
Tuesday, the two surviving Democratic hopefuls found little to
disagree about in their first head-to-head debate Friday night in
Philadelphia.
   ``Any combination on this stage against George Bush ... will
beat the Republicans in November,'' said civil rights leader
Jackson.
   ``The two remaining _ and I guess that makes us the leading _
candidates for the Democratic nomination are the son of immigrants
from Massachusetts and a black man who grew up poor in South
Carolina,'' the Massachusetts governor told the hour-long debate in
Philadelphia. ``I think that says everything there is to say about
his country.''
   Bush, his nomination victory well in hand, spent Friday fishing
in Florida.
   Both Democrats headed back out across Pennsylvania today,
looking for votes in the Tuesday balloting with 178 delegates at
stake. A second debate was scheduled tonight in Pittsburgh.
   The good humor of the debate sponsored by the Pennsylvania
Democratic party stood in sharp contrast to the harsh racial and
religious overtones of the New York primary only a week ago.
   Jackson insisted it is a close race for the Democratic
nomination, but Dukakis is firmly in the front-runner's spot with a
widening lead in the national delegate battle and a substantial
edge in the polls for the Pennsylvania primary.
   Who will fill the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket occupied
much of the debate. It has also dominated the Democratic campaign
since Dukakis won his big New York victory to become the odds-on
favorite to win the presidential nomination at the party convention
in Atlanta in July.
   ``It's a bit premature to be giving out coronation roses for the
governor and taps for me,'' Jackson said when asked if he would
accept the No. 2 spot. ``We're now moving into the last lap of a
significant race, and I'm a long-distance runner. I look forward to
it.''
   Dukakis, who has denied even thinking about a running mate, then
turned to Jackson and asked softly:
   ``Are you interested?''
   After the audience's laughter subsided, Jackson smiled and
replied, ``You got it, Mike.''
   Dukakis had a curt response to a question of whether he believed
polls showing Jackson as the vice presidential nominee would cost
Democrats the White House in the fall elections: ``No.''
   Jackson drew his share of laughter as well, in response to a
question about how the Democrats could win the South in the general
election.
   ``Mike Dukakis on my ticket will win the South,'' the
preacher-turned-politician said.
   The only harsh words of the day were directed at Republicans.
   ``First of all, the drug program of the Reagan administration is
to have the First Lady to say `Just say no,' the president to just
cut the budget, and Mr. Bush to just say and do nothing,'' Jackson
said during the debate.
   Earlier, Dukakis said Bush fails to understand what it takes to
``build an economic future and to create good jobs.''
   ``I don't see how we are going to bring good jobs and good wages
back to the industrial Midwest unless we work together,'' Dukakis
said in Toledo. ``If the vice president doesn't understand that,
then he shouldn't be running for president.''
   Both men told reporters after the debate that keeping the focus
on winning in the fall was the correct course.
   The only differences between the two in the debate were not
major ones.
   Dukakis praised plant-closing legislation, saying he had used a
state law like the one now before Congress to save thousands of
jobs in Massachusetts.
   Jackson said reinvesting in the nation is more important.
   He also pressed Dukakis seriously on South Africa, suggesting
that Dukakis's strong stand against terrorism should be applied to
that nation and its ``state-sponsored terrorism.''
   ``I would be very tough on South Africa,'' the Massachusetts
governor replied.

   Senate leaders say they won't be pushed into
approving the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty to meet a White House
deadline of ratifying the historic pact before President Reagan's
trip to Moscow in late May.
   The Senate still needs to nail down answers to questions about
whether the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty bans
futuristic weapons as well as existing missiles, Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Friday.
   Assurances by the White House and a top Soviet official that
both superpowers agree the treaty does ban future types of weapons
aren't enough, said Byrd and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``We need to make sure, be absolutely clear,'' said Nunn,
speaking of the issue of how the pact affects weapons such as
lasers or particle beam weapons.
   Byrd told his colleagues: ``I did not set the date of the
summit, I had nothing to do with it. This Senate is no president's
rubber stamp and this senator is no president's man.''
   Reagan had said Thursday that he hopes the pact is approved in
time for him to take a ratification notice to Moscow for his May
29-June 2 meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Reagan, asked whether failure to ratify the pact would affect
the summit, said, ``I think it would be very upsetting and it would
put a strain on the summit.''
   When the Senate finally does vote, ratification is likely, said
Byrd. Ratification requires 67 votes, and Byrd and Republican
leaders have said they believe 90 of the 100 senators will support
the pact.
   Nunn said the futuristic weapons issues could be settled by an
amendment to the pact.
   The administration has urged ratification without any amendments
and will likely portray Nunn's proposal as ``a killer amendment,''
he said. But ``I don't see this as a killer amendment.''
   A so-called killer amendment is one attached to a treaty that
could make it unacceptable to the parties that negotiated the
agreement, and thus ``kill'' the treaty.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said the questions should be answered, but
noted, ``there is an advantage to having this ratified'' before the
summit begins.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, also said he supports speedy ratification so that ``we
can keep this momentum toward arms control.''
   The treaty would ban nuclear missiles with a range of 300 to
3,400 miles.

<HEAD>Department Sets Up Task Force To Monitor Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department secretly created a
special drought task force seven weeks ago to keep track of dry
weather that threatened much of the West.
   Officials announced Friday that the task force was set up by
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng on March 1 and had been
meeting weekly in his office. No mention of the nature of the
meeting was evident in his published daily schedules or in those of
senior aides.
   But the dry weather has since prompted many reports of drought
around the country since then, and there have been repeated
references to it in the news media in those affected areas, said
Dave Lane, USDA director of information. So it was decided to go
public about USDA's task force.
   Lane defended the secrecy, saying: ``It was more of a review of
the situation than anything else. If we had put out some big
announcement, we might have looked like we were trying to pat
ourselves on the back.''
   Lyng appointed Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers as chairman of
the panel. Others include heads of USDA agencies mostly closely
associated with farm programs, credit and other resources that
might be needed.
   In his statement announcing the task force, Lyng said that USDA
is stepping up contact with state agriculture departments in the
affected areas so those can ``provide us with a constant flow of
information regarding the moisture situation and preparations'' for
relief.
   The Pacific Northwest and other western states, which suffered
through drought last year, appear to be the prime regions for
another drought spell in 1988, with several states reporting
February and March being the driest on record, he said.
   Conditions likely to cause problems for agricultural producers
were said to prevail in parts of California, Nevada, Oregon,
Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Washington, Utah and North Dakota.
   Some other states are having extremely dry weather in smaller
areas, raising concerns that forest fires could be severe this year.
   Lyng said that several of the USDA agency administrators report
that their state and county offices in the dry areas have been
received numerous inquiries about various federal drought
assistance programs.
   In a related report on the outlook for western water supplies,
Wilson Scaling, chief of the department's Soil Conservation
Service, said that in March, for the second month in a row,
precipitation was well below normal in the West. He said parts of
California and Nevada reported the driest February and March
combination on record.
   But some areas improved last month, including the Pacific
Northwest, the western Gulf of Alaska, the northern Cascade range,
the Colorado-Wyoming border, and most parts of Idaho.
   ``Idaho reported its first month of above-average precipitation
in over a year,'' Scaling said. ``We are encouraged by that
eading.''

   A quarterly report by the Agriculture
Department shows cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 9.37 million head as of April 1, up 6
percent from a year ago and 5 percent above two years ago.
   Only Arizona and Illinois showed decreases from April 1, 1987,
while cattle numbers in Minnesota were virtually unchanged.
Increases were reported for California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during January, February
and March totaled 5.81 million head, a 1 percent increase from the
same period of 1987 and also 1 percent more than in 1986, the
report said Friday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the first
quarter of the year totaled 5.8 million head, up 2 percent from
last year and 10 percent more than two years ago.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.93 million head
during April, May and June, up 6 percent from second-quarter levels
of last year and 2 percent more than two years ago.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of April
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Investigator Says Mob Organized Into `Cells' Like Terrorist Groups</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigator who almost became the first
FBI agent inducted into an organized crime family says he was
pulled out of the mob by his FBI superiors after being ordered to
kill a gangster from a rival group.
   ``The FBI felt _ and so did I _ that this was a good time for
getting out, because everybody was being killed,'' Joseph D.
Pistone told senators, explaining that he was given the hit
assignment during a mob civil war.
   Pistone also told members of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations there's a ``surprising similarity'' between the
structure of organized crime families and terrorist groups.
   He said ``a strict need-to-know policy is enforced,'' and fellow
mobsters often avoid telling each other their last names.
   Pistone, who spent six years working undercover with the mob,
said he was scheduled to become a ``made'' member of New York's
Bonanno family in December 1981. The FBI abruptly ended his
operation a half-year after two Bonanno factions began a civil war,
he said.
   FBI spokeswoman Kathy Bradford said that to this day, no agent
has ever become a formal ``made'' member of the mob rather than an
associate.
   Pistone testified from behind a screen because he has been
relocated and changed his appearance. But he has told his story
before, in court testimony and in a book on his six years posing as
a small-time but successful jewel thief and burglar, Donnie Brasco.
   Pistone's testimony in trials resulted in more than 200
indictments and more than 100 convictions of organized crime
members.
   Explaining the workings of mob families, Pistone said: ``There
is a surprising similarity which marks the inner-workings of the
Mafia and contemporary terrorist organizations.
   ``The families are broken down into small, separate cells,
commonly called crews.
   ``In all likelihood, a member of one crew may not even know who
are the members of another crew in his own family.''
   He said ``gambling is probably the most important source of
income'' for traditional organized crime families. Gambling
supports other mob activities, such as drug buys, payoffs, lawyer's
fees, and investments into legitimate businesses, he said.

   Industries trying to capitalize on
superconducting technology will get help from three federal
research facilities under a program announced by the Energy
Department.
   The Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico and Oak Ridge National Laboratory in
Tennessee were designated on Friday as special pilot centers,
Energy Secretary John S. Herrington said.
   The centers, he said, will collaborate with industry on
applications of the technology gleaned from basic energy research.
   President Reagan last year outlined a program last year under
which government and industry will work together to find commercial
uses for high-temperature superconductors, which can conduct
electricity without energy loss.
   ``Superconductors ... have great potential in such areas as
electrical generation, storage and transmission, computers,
communications, medical diagnostics and transportation,'' the
Energy Department said. ``However, the newly discovered materials
will require extensive research and development.''
   All three laboratories have been active in superconductivity
research and have the facilities and expertise needed to make the
technology marketable, Herrington said.

<HEAD>Yost Says Coast Guard Patrol Cuts Could Be Leading To Drug Trade
Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Coast Guard says severe
cutbacks in air and sea drug patrols by the financially strapped
agency could be leading to an increase in drug trafficking along
U.S. coasts.
   ``The smugglers, when they ship, don't send us an invoice,''
said Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr. ``But we do have intelligence that
indicates the awareness by the smugglers that the Coast Guard has
cut back its patrols by ship and by air.
   ``I can only surmise that that influences their shipping
schedules'' and that there is ``some intention of taking advantage
of that,'' he said.
   The Coast Guard, faced with a $100 million budget shortfall,
earlier this year permanently shut down dozens of stations,
resulting in $40 million in savings.
   To cover the remaining $60 million, Yost ordered a 55 percent
across-the-board reduction of sea and air missions for drug
interdiction and routine search-and-rescue patrols. The cutbacks
have been in effect for about three months.
   ``Fifty-five percent of my ships are sitting alongside the dock
and planes are on the runways,'' the commandant said in interviews
this week with The Associated Press.
   ``I think that's a travesty,'' he said. ``I really think the
American people, having paid money for the ships and aircraft, and
... paying the salary of the young men and women who they've
trained to do these jobs, to have them sitting on the runway and
tied up at the dock. That ought to make the taxpayer angry.''
   Last month, President Reagan urged Congress to transfer $60
million in other Transportation Department funds, such as Amtrak,
mass transit and highway projects, to the Coast Guard to bring the
patrols back up to last year's levels. But Congress has yet to act.
   Yost said he believes he is caught in the middle of two
political realities on Capitol Hill, and that he is coming out on
the short end.
   ``What I see there is every member of Congress hates drugs and
supports and loves the Coast Guard, particularly members of our
appropriations subcommittees,'' Yost said. ``But they are forced to
choose between drug interdiction and mass transit'' projects in
their districts.
   ``I would guess very few of those members are saying, `Take my
money,''' he said.
   Yost said he sympathized with the chairmen of the transportation
funding panels, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Bill
Lehman, D-Fla.
   ``They're both strong supporters of the Coast Guard, and yet
they have a very difficult time taking money from their grant
programs to properly fund the Coast Guard,'' he said.
   A Lehman aide said the House subcommittee may take up the Coast
Guard's funding request this week.

   Stock prices topped the 27,000-point level in an
active half-day of trading Saturday, buoyed by an overnight rally
on Wall Street, analysts said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which gained 8.96 points Friday, surged by 221.25 points to close
the half-day session at 27,058.37. It was the Nikkei's
second-highest close since April 14, when it was 27,111.35. Volume
on the first section was a moderate 470 million shares.
   ``Since there were few new incentives to affect the market
today, it's clear that investors had been waiting on the sidelines
for New York share prices to recover,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Yoshio Shimayama, a trader with Nikko Securities, attributed the
favorable showing to the growing Japanese economy.
   ``The market is looking at the state of business in Japan, which
is very favorable. ... The major recovery in share prices in New
York overnight is also driving the market, and the overall mood of
investors here is very strong,'' Shimayama said.
   Large issues such as steels and constructions were traded
actively, along with electricals such as Sony and Toshiba.
   Buy orders for Toshiba Corp., targeted for penalty sanctions in
an omnibus trade bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives
Thursday, totaled more than 6.1 million shares, compared with
730,000 sell orders.
   ``It indicates the (positive) mood of market investors,'' the
Nomura analyst said.
   The Tokyo foreign exchange is closed on Saturdays.

<HEAD>Rep. Price Remembered As Advocate For Military, Servant To
Constituents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Melvin Price, an Illinois Democrat
elected in the waning days of World War II who rose to second in
House seniority, was remembered at his death as a loyal servant to
his constituents and a strong advocate for the nation's military.
   Price, 83, died Friday of cancer at Malcolm Grove Hospital at
Andrews Air Force Base. He was serving his 22nd term in Congress, a
tenure surpassed only by 24-term Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Mass.
   Price, who had announced two years ago this would be his last
term in the House, for 10 years chaired the chamber's Armed
Services Committee. He was ousted from that post in January 1985 by
younger Democrats seeking a more vigorous watchdog on the Reagan
administration's military policies.
   During his tenure as head of the committee, Price had presided
over the drive to beef up the nation's arms stockpile with the MX
missile, the B-1 bomber, a nuclear aircraft carrier and a vast
array of other hardware.
   A proposed amendment to the Pentagon budget bill pending in the
House would name a new Trident missile-firing submarine for Price.
   He considered himself a staunch supporter of administration
requests for military spending regardless of which party was in
power, acknowledging the committee under his aegis was somewhat of
a ``rubber stamp'' for the Pentagon.
   ``In many ways, it is,'' Price once said. ``I'd rather be
criticized for being for something than have to alibi when we need
it and we don't have it.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., who replaced Price as chairman of Armed
Services, called him ``a fair, evenhanded, thoughtful member'' with
``a quiet grace that will be missed around Congress.''
   Price had suffered in recent years from arthritis and diabetes,
and learned in the last month that he had pancreatic cancer, said
administrative assistant Mike Mansfield. He went to the hospital
early Friday complaining of pain and died in the early evening.
   Price, who had been a sports writer in the 1920s, grew up along
the banks of the Mississippi River in East St. Louis. He came to
Congress as an aide at the start of the New Deal and won election
while serving as an enlisted man in the Army.
   He took office in 1945, as the Red Army was closing in on Adolph
Hitler's bunker.
   Illinois' two Democratic senators said Price's impact on his
state and on the nation's military would continue.
   ``Mel Price was a man of the people who kept a common touch
after reaching great heights. He moved from being an Army corporal
to contributing in a major way to the nation's defense,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon.
   Sen. Alan Dixon said Price ``had absolutely no peer in service
to his constituency. He was my mentor and close personal friend. My
deepest sympathies are with his wife today.''
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, a Republican, said, ``Mel Price
dedicated his life to serving the people of southwestern Illinois,
and he became one of the most powerful people in Congress.
   ``The people of his district will miss Representative Price, but
the evidence of his dedication is clearly visible throughout the
towns and villages of that area,'' Thompson said.
   Price, himself a victim of ouster from the Armed Services panel
by younger lawmakers, first was selected to chair the panel in 1974
when junior lawmakers rebelled against Rep. F. Edward Herbert,
D-La., whom they considered too autocratic.
   He continued to serve as chairman of the panel's research and
development subcommittee even after his ouster from the committee's
top position, but in his later years suffered from severe arthritis
which forced him to inch his way across Capitol Hill and miss some
legislative business due to hospitalization.
   Price in 1986 survived a four-way primary battle to win his
party's nomination, and defeated his GOP challenger by just 943
votes, his smallest margin of victory.
   In Illinois, Madison County Clerk Evelyn Bowles, said Gov. James
R. Thompson has five days from the death to call for a special
election, which would must be held within 115 days of the
governor's call.
   Price is survived by his wife, Garaldine, and one son, Dr.
William Price of Colorado Springs, Colo.

<HEAD>New Rules Designed To Prevent Trauma To Show Horses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New rules regulating the hoof pads used on
Tennessee Walking Horses and other show horses take effect Monday
in an effort to prevent the use of cruel methods to give the
animals a distinctive gait.
   The Agriculture Department regulations will be phased in
gradually to prevent trauma to show horses, many of which currently
have pads that are four inches high, said James W. Glosser, acting
administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   ``To remove four-inch pads abruptly could cause stress on a
horse's feet and limbs,'' he said.
   From April 25 through July 31, pads may be no more than three
inches high; from Aug. 1 through Oct. 31, two inches; and,
effective Nov. 1, no more than one-half inch high covering the sole
of the foot.
   At that time, however, an additional half-inch-high ``rim'' pad
will be allowed between the full pad and the shoe. All pads must be
made of leather or other similar soft, pliable material.
   Glosser said the new rules prohibit chains or rollers that weigh
more than six ounces, including the weight of the fastener. Weights
on the hoof other than the specified pads are also prohibited,
except for horseshoes weighing up to 16 ounces.
   The Horse Protection Act was passed in 1970 to eliminate the
practice of ``soring'' to produce special gaits in horses.
   ``Soring is the use of cruel methods, devices or chemical
substances on a horse's legs or feet that can reasonably be
expected to cause a horse to experience pain when walking,'' the
agency said in its statement. ``Soring is done primarily to alter a
horse's gait in the show ring.''
   The new interim rules apply to all breeds of horses at shows or
sales, the agency said.
   Agency officials will continue to monitor horse shows and work
with the industry to prevent soring, he said.
   ``If we find sored horses, we will take action against the
responsible parties, regardless of the devices used,'' Glosser said.
   On March 21, a U.S. District Court here, in a lawsuit brought
against USDA by the American Horse Protection Association,
invalidated certain sections of the department's horse protection
regulations.
   In the court order and a clarifying order issued April 13, the
court directed USDA to initiate rulemaking to eliminate devices
that could reasonably be expected to cause soring, the agency said.
The court specifically referred to pads and chains used on the
front feet and legs of horses to alter their gaits.

<HEAD>Students In Four Countries Play Diplomat Via Computer Links</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEB RIECHMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College students in 10 states and three
countries are linking up by computer to simulate global bargaining
for peace. But they're finding make-believe hostilities are often
as touchy as in real life.
   In the first few days of the exercise this semester, Iran
rejected Iraq's offer to end their war as ``treachery'' and the
Soviet Union dispatched a flurry of communiques calling the United
States ``offensive.''
   The 700 students are playing diplomat as part of the
International Communication and Negotiation Simulations program,
based at the University of Maryland.
   ``We're not doing an adequate job in American education of
teaching how to live and function in an interdependent world,''
said Jonathan Wilkenfeld, a government and politics professor at
the college who co-directs the program. ``It's only been in recent
years that we have discovered a need to become more of a part of
issues that other countries find important.''
   One scenario envisioned by the students, who work six months in
the future, proved all too real.
   ``We assassinated (Egyptian President Anwar) Sadat about three
months before it really happened,'' said Wilkenfeld, who encourages
students to seek solutions through peaceful negotiation. ``We felt
badly about that.''
   ICONS began in 1981 with a grant from the U.S. Education
Department. In its early days, the program involved three or four
universities. This semester, 15 universities are participating
through computer links from the University of Maryland to
Tennessee, New Jersey, North Carolina, California, Pennsylvania,
Utah, Vermont, Wyoming and Wisconsin.
   The computer also links American students to others in France,
Argentina and Japan. Messages during the five-week simulation often
are sent in foreign languages and must be translated with care so
sensitive correspondence is not misunderstood. With students living
in various time zones, setting up computer conferences often
becomes a logistical nightmare.
   The simulations are based on a scenario of world events written
before the game begins each semester. The scenario takes what's
happening in the world and projects it six to eight months ahead,
Bass said. That way, students are not tempted to read newspapers
and magazines looking for negotiating tips and strategies, she said.
   In the first few days of this semester's simulation, the
Soviets, played by students at Brigham Young University in Provo,
Utah, sent out more than 100 messages, said Doreen Bass, simulation
director and a member of the University of Maryland's research
faculty.
   ``A lot of it was cold war rhetoric and the United States
(students at Maryland) sent a response saying it was not pleased
with what it called propaganda,'' Bass said.
   Two days later, the ``Soviets'' rebutted:
   ``The Soviet leadership and people were deeply wounded and
pained by the offensive and insensitive communique received from
the United States this week,'' the Brigham Young team wrote. ``We
are all concerned and troubled to find that the cold war still
rages in the hearts of American leaders.''
   Meanwhile, the Iranian team, played by a different group of
Maryland students, was busy composing a reply to the Iraqi team's
offer to terminate its involvement in the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``Iraq sent out a message saying they were unilaterally
withdrawing from the war, returning all Iranian POWs, returning all
borders to original pre-war positions,'' said Adam Pinchuck, a
member of the Iranian team. ``We flatly rejected it and said it was
`filled with duplicity and treachery and horrific lies.'''

   A Japanese man linked by authorities to the
terrorist Red Army has been indicted for carrying pipe bombs on the
New Jersey Turnpike, officials said.
   Yu Kikumura, 35, was charged with three counts of interstate
transport of explosive devices, three counts of possessing
unregistered explosive devices and three counts of possession of
explosives by an illegal alien, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr.
said Friday.
   Kikumura, identified by the Japanese Foreign Ministry as a
suspected member of the terrorist Red Army group, also was charged
with one count each of having an illegal passport, a fraudulent
visa and the passport of another person, Alito said.
   The charges together carry a prison term of up to 90 years.
   Police in Milan, Italy, said Thursday that Kikumura spent a few
days in a city hotel in February prior to an April 14 car bombing
allegedly staged by the Red Army. The blast killed an American
servicewoman and four Italians outside a USO club in Naples.
   FBI experts haved traveled to Italy to try to determine whether
Kikumura was linked to those involved in the bombing.
   He was arrested April 12 at a service area on the turnpike in
Ridgefield after a state trooper found the sophisticated homemade
bombs and falsified papers, authorities said.
   Officials said Kikumura used a passport stolen from a Japanese
hospital worker to obtain a U.S. entry visa from the U.S. Embassy
in Paris on Feb. 29. He entered the country on March 8, authorities
said.
   Ronald Kuby, who along with noted radical defense attorney
William Kunstler is defending Kikumura, said he found the number of
charges incredible.
   ``You've taken a straightforward single offense, multiplied it,
pyramided it until you face a century in jail,'' Kuby said,
comparing it to a person arrested for distributing drugs and facing
a separate count for each unit of the drug sold.
   ``He is being indicted for what the government thinks he is
rather than what he has done,'' Kuby said.
   Kikumura is being held without bail in the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in New York without bail.
   Alito said he is to be arraigned next Friday in Newark before
U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr.

   Jesse Jackson said following his first
one-on-one debate with Michael Dukakis the presidential campaign
has begun ``a new phase'' in which differences between the two
Democrats will be more clearly spelled out.
   Pressed by reporters about differences between the two remaining
Democratic contenders, Jackson said Friday nigt Dukakis has not
been forthcoming in detailing how he would translate his
``Massachusetts miracle'' into solutions to aid the nation's
economy.
   As Massachusetts governor, Dukakis takes much of the credit for
his state's 2.9 percent unemployment rate, its plant-closings
notice law and America's first universal health-insurance law.
   But Jackson, speaking at the University of Pennsylvania four
days before the state's primary, said Dukakis ``so far has made out
no budget.''
   ``There must be some budget in order to establish priorities, in
order to establish the plan,'' Jackson said.
   ``You simply cannot afford a decent job for everybody at good
wages, and you cannot afford houses for everybody in this country
unless you are going to make some judgments about shifting
priorities,'' Jackson said. ``I'm willing to debate ways to pay for
the dream.''
   Jackson said he has called for a plan to freeze the military
budget over the next five years, and that ``I have put forth a
comprehensive plan to fight the war on drugs. The governor has
not.''
   Still, Jackson said he was wary of ``fracturing'' the party, and
said he hoped there could be ``distinction without division.''
   Jackson spoke to reporters after a good-natured, hour-long
debate with Dukakis, their first such confrontation since Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. dropped out of the race after the New York
primary on Tuesday.
   Another debate was planned for tonight in Pittsburgh, where
Jackson's support is shakier than in Philadelphia. In Philadelphia,
Jackson has the support of the mayor and numerous other local
elected officials.
   Later Friday night, Jackson told a rocking congregation at the
Calvin Presbyterian Church in west Philadelphia that the debate
``begins a new phase of the campaign'' in which a less crowded
field will enable voters to become more familiar with individual
candidates.
   He was flanked at the podium by his mother, Helen; Mayor W.
Wilson Goode; Councilman Lucien Blackwell; State Rep. David
Richardson of Philadelphia; and actress Margot Kidder, a supporter
who has joined Jackson previously on the campaign trail.
   Earlier, Jackson addressed students at nearby West Chester State
University, and announced a plan and a budget for a national
child-care program with a $5.3 billion price tag.
   The plan calls for an increase in child-care assistance for
families with low and moderate incomes and a strategy to use public
schools for befo re-school and after-school programs.

<HEAD>Church Urges End To U.S. Sanctions, Saying Panama Has Suffered
Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church is calling
on the United States to lift economic sanctions imposed in an
attempt to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. It says Panama has
suffered enough.
   ``We cannot continue like this,'' the church hierarchy lamented
in an eight-page pastoral letter made public Friday.
   The letter says the economic crisis brought on by the sanctions
has meant ``misery and desperation'' for thousands of Panamanians
and sparked an exodus ``that is beginning to have worrisome
dimensions.''
   The letter, signed by Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath and the
nation's 10 bishops, also expressed concern about rising crime and
worry that the nation is being turned into ``a sinister battle
camp.''
   Noriega, Panama's de facto leader and head of its 15,000-strong
Defense Forces, was indicted in Florida on federal drug trafficking
charges in February. The sanctions, imposed since, froze Panamanian
assets in the United States and barred payments to the
Noriega-controlled administration by U.S. citizens and
organizations.
   Combined with closures of the banks and a two-week strike in
March, the measures have brought Panama's economy to a virtual
standstill.
   In its letter, the church says the sanctions have dealt a blow
to all Panamanians, but especially to the poorest.
   It said the measures ``exceed any strategy of political pressure
and constitute by themselves a threat to the life of our people.
   ``They are therefore morally unjust. Because of that, we demand
that they be suspended immediately. In the same way, we reject all
forms of military intervention.''
   The church described as ``the gravest part of the situation''
the lack of dialogue between the government and Noriega's
opponents. It urged both sides to negotiate and end to the crisis
and said it was willing to mediate the dispute.
   The church agreed at the end of March to mediate talks between
the two sides, but suspended the effort a week later.
   Financial analysts, meanwhile, said the government was looking
for an international organization to step in and help it process a
backlog of checks accumulated during the bank shutdown.
   The government has been frustrated in its efforts to arrange a
clearing-house operation with a private European or a Latin
American bank.
   A financial analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the government was turning to an international organization because
it would be ``beyond the scope of (any in) the United States.''
   It was not clear which international organization would have the
capability to act as a bank and process the thousands of
accumulated checks.
   Banks closed the first week of March after customers began a run
on some local institutions. The run was touched off when President
Eric Arturo Delvalle was deposed Feb. 26 after he tried to fire
Noriega.

   There had been reports Yegor K. Ligachev was
demoted as the Kremlin's No. 2 man for defiance in resisting Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for reform.
   But Friday, the two chatted amiably during a ceremony at the
Kremlin's Palace of Congresses. The display of unity was witnessed
by thousands inside the building and millions of television viewers.
   Ligachev's fate and relationship with Gorbachev have been
subjects of gossip and debate in official and intellectual circles
since a newspaper published a letter to the editor a month ago
defending dictator Josef Stalin.
   Ligachev, 67, is known to promote more restrained reform than
Gorbachev's plan for a restructuring Soviet society, so there was
speculation he was behind the letter in Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   It appeared in the name of a Leningrad teacher and was
interpreted as a sign conservative opposition to Gorbachev was
gaining strength.
   Pravda later excoriated the pro-Stalin letter. The Communist
Party daily made clear that the ``glasnost'' policy of more
openness does not authorize opposition to ``perestroika,''
Gorbachev's word for his reform program.
   In Moscow, the newspaper exchange was seen as an allegory for
the struggle between Gorbachev and Ligachev.
   Some sources report that Gorbachev called a special meeting of
the Politburo to reprimand Ligachev for opposing his reforms, and
that his responsibility for ideology and party personnel were given
to Alexander N. Yakovlev, a Politburo member who is a staunch
Gorbachev ally.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze held a news conference
Friday night and told reporters there were no serious disagreements
in the leadership.
   ``Sometimes we differ but this is only an indication of the fact
that our society is undergoing a process of democratization,'' he
said. ``There is no sign of any conflict situation.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev was asked about the
rumors earlier in the day and said ``there has been no change in
the distribution of duties'' among party leaders.
   Perfiliev appeared unsure of Ligachev's status, however, and
said he thought the No. 2 man was on a ``short vacation.''
   When the Politburo filed into the Kremlin hall Friday to mark
the 118th anniversary of Vladimir Lenin's birth, Ligachev had the
position accorded the chief ideologist and second-ranking leader:
after Gorbachev, President Andrei A. Gromyko and Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov.
   Several shots on television showed Ligachev and Gorbachev in
animated conversation while non-voting Politburo member Georgy P.
Razumovsky spoke for nearly an hour about perestroika's merits.
   Gorbachev and supporters of his reforms have acknowledged
resistance at the highest levels but have not named their opponents.
   Ligachev was elevated to the Politburo after Gorbachev, now 57,
became Communist Party chief in March 1985.
   His speeches have shown him to be more conservative than
Gorbachev. He is reported to feel glasnost has gone too far in
denouncing most economic and social policies of the past.
   Ligachev was made a full Politburo member in April 1985, at the
first Central Committee meeting under Gorbachev, without having
served the customary term as a non-voting member.

   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail:
   
   JESSE JACKSON, asked Friday if he would accept the No. 2 spot on
the Democratic ticket with Dukakis: ``It's a bit premature to be
giving out coronation roses for the governor and taps for me. We're
now moving into the last lap of a significant race, and I'm a
long-distance runner. I look forward to it.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, in Philadelphia at his first one-on-one debate
with Jesse Jackson: ``The two remaining _ and I guess that makes us
the leading _ candidates for the Democratic nomination are the son
of immigrants from Massachusetts and a black man who grew up poor
in South Carolina. I think that says everything there is to say
about this country.''
   
   FRANK FAHRENKOPF, Jr., Republican National Chairman, calling for
party unity at a discordant Nevada GOP convention: ``The old and
new faces in our party must unite and work to defeat our common
enemy.''

<HEAD>HHS Wants To Transfer Family Planning To States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration will ask Congress to
transfer administration of the federal family planning program from
the Department of Health and Human Services to the states.
   Assistant HHS Secretary Robert Windom said Friday the shift
would enable states ``to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring
services to more appropriately and effectively meet their citizens'
family planning needs.''
   In testimony to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health, Windom said a federal ban on use of funds for
abortion-related services and priority on serving low-income
families would be retained.
   Windom said that by running their own programs, states could not
only improve services but could also avoid ``burdensome
application, reporting and monitoring requirements in the current
program.''

<HEAD>Reagan, With Reservations, Signs Bill on Drug Mislabeling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed a bill designed to
police mislabeled drugs, but said he will seek repeal of a
provision requiring states to follow federal standards in licensing
wholesale drug distributors.
   ``I support the expressed goal of this legislation, which is to
reduce potential public health risks that may result from the
distribution of mislabeled, subpotent, counterfeit or adulterated
prescriptions drugs,'' the president said Friday.
   But he said the portion requiring federal standards to be
adhered to in licensing drug wholesalers ``represents a substantial
intrusion into traditional state responsibilities and
prerogatives.''
   He said he asked the Department of Justice to submit legislation
to the Congress repealing that portion of the bill.

<HEAD>Interior Department Said To Have Understated Irrigation Subsidies</HEAD>

   The Interior Department says its own experts

amount of federal subsidies for irrigation in the West.
   The information was contained in documents released by Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., who said Friday they show the department ``went

subsidy estimate.''
   The department ``used a subsidy calculation it knew was
inconsistent with the method in President Reagan's fiscal year 1989

   The women's softball game between the University
of Massachusetts and Boston College lasted only an inning before
the contest was suspended because of ``unsafe playing conditions.''
   It wasn't lightning or high wind that sent the players back to
the locker room. Just a case of flying hammers.
   It seems some of the hammer throwers competing in the Boston
College Relays adjacent to the softball diamond were a bit off
target.
   Before play began Thursday, base umpires told the coaches that
they would keep an eye out for errant hammers, said Massachusetts
Coach Elaine Sortino.
   ``They told us to advise our outfielders that when they yelled
`heads up,' the outfielders were to start running towards home
plate,'' she said Friday.
   However, when three 16-pound weights plunked into the outfield
without a yip, and, between innings, a fourth ``landed right where
a fielder would be standing,'' Sortino said she decided ``my
players aren't going out there.''
   ``The officials tried to persuade us to play an inning and then
let the hammer throwers take some throws and then play another
inning, but there were skads of them, it was freezing cold, already
late, and it would have gone on forever,'' said Sortino, whose
protest prompted the umpires to suspend the game.
   Some 25 men and 25 women hammer throwers, with three throws
each, competed, said Reid Oslin, assistant athletic director at
Boston College.
   ``We never had anything like this happen before,'' Oslin said.
``We host one major track meet a year and we will never again
schedule a softball game at the same time.''

   Together, they've handled everything from
domestic calls to burglaries to arsons to barking dogs. The only
difference is that now Linda and Jimmy Bivens are handling it as
husband and wife.
   The newlyweds, both Illinois state troopers, met in 1984 when
Mrs. Bivens _ already a state cop _ visited the State Police
Academy in Springfield, where her future beau was just a cadet.
   But the 28-year-old said of her husband, ``He didn't like me at
first. He thought I was one of those women who was taking his job.''
   That opinion didn't last long after Bivens, 30, finished his
training and they were put on the same detail.
   ``Once we started working together, he realized I was all right.
We got to be real good friends,'' Mrs. Bivens said.
   ``She earned my respect,'' said Bivens. ``I've worked on Chicago
expressway details, state fairs ... and she's one of the best
policemen I've ever worked with.
   ``When you work with someone under trying circumstances, you see
not just their good side,'' he added. ``When you see them hot and
sweaty, directing traffic, or handling a fatality, you get a true
picture of them.''
   The couple, who married a month ago, trust each other to handle
any situation that arises.
   ``Naturally there's concern if you love someone. But really, she
does a good job,'' Bivens said.
   ``And I know he's a good policeman,'' Mrs. Bivens said.

<HEAD>Former Archbishop Of Canterbury Lord Ramsey Dies At 83</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Ramsey, a
kindly, craggy Christian and brilliant debater who traveled the
world in his passion to unite its divided churches, died early
today, the Church of England said. He was 83.
   Ramsey was president of the World Council of Churches from 1961
to 1968.
   The church press office said in a statement that he died at St.
John's Home, a residence for elderly people in Oxford, after being
ill for several weeks with bronchial pneumonia.
   His wife, Lady Ramsey, was at his side when he died peacefully
at about 2 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT Friday).
   As Archbishop of Canterbury from 1961 to 1974, he was spiritual
head of the Church of England and leader of the world's 70 million
Anglicans, including the 3 million U.S. Episcopalians.
   Ramsey took a liberal stand on a wide variety of political and
social issues of his day.
   He condemned the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam during the
Vietnam War, called for Britain to discard its nuclear weapons
unilaterally and campaigned for relaxation of the laws restricting
homosexuality, divorce and abortion.
   Ramsey demanded the abolition of the death penalty, was an
outspoken opponent of South Africa's apartheid policy of racial
separation and opposed restrictions on the admission of Asian
immigrants into Britain.
   At his enthronement as Archbishop of Canterbury, Ramsey
described his objectives as ``the unity of Christians.''
   The Church of England was at the time in process of a long
decline, with dwindling church attendance and a diminishing role in
the everyday lives of ordinary Britons.
   But Ramsey pushed the Church toward Christian reunion, which he
predicted might come about before the end of this century, and made
it aware of the world beyond England.
   His passion to reunite the Christian churches _ the
Nonconformist, the Anglican, the Eastern Orthodox, and the Roman
Catholic, divided over the centuries _ took him to more countries
than any other Archbishop of Canterbury before him.
   Ramsey was bitterly disappointed when the General Synod of the
Church of England in 1972 rejected union with the Methodists.
   His air of craggy Christian kindness, as one newspaper described
it, inspired trust and confidence among those who met him.
   Michael Ramsey was born on Nov. 14, 1904, the son of a lecturer
in mathematics at Cambridge University. His paternal grandfather
was a Congregationalist minister and his maternal grandfather was
an Anglican clergyman.
   He was educated at Cambridge, ordained in 1928, and became
Bishop of Durham in 1952 and Archbishop of York in 1956.
   Ramsey was made a life peer on his retirement as archbishop in
1974 and took the title of Lord Ramsey of Canterbury.
   He was succeeded by Donald Coggan, who retired from the post in
1980. The current Archbishop of Canterbury is Robert Runcie.
   A funeral service for Ramsey will be held in historic Canterbury
Cathedral in southeast England and a memorial service is also
planned at London's Westminster Abbey, the statement said. No dates
have yet been set.

   Jesse Jackson's campaign co-chairman in
Sedgwick County says he will campaign against Rep. Dan Glickman if
the Kansas Democrat doesn't support Jackson for the presidential
nomination.
   Glickman, an uncommitted ``super delegate'' to the Democratic
convention, said Friday night that he thinks Charles McAfee was
speaking ``in the heat of a campaign, and, besides, I don't respond
to threats.''
   McAfee said of his comments, ``I didn't make a threat, it's just
the truth. I'm not a politician. I don't play games.''
   He said he served notice to Glickman, a former supporter of Rep.
Richard Gephardt's presidential campaign, two weeks ago at a
gathering of Jackson's Kansas delegates.
   ``My words were, `I love the boy like a son, but if he doesn't
back Jackson, I will campaign against him,''' McAfee said.
   ``Everyone comes to the black community and asks for help,'' he
said. ``Just when does anybody think we can expect something in
return? I keep saying over and over again, how long?''
   The confrontation came on the eve of Democratic conventions
scheduled today in the state's five congressional districts, where
the first 26 Kansas delegates to the Democratic National Convention
were to be chosen.

<TEXT>
   Increasing racial tensions on campus
in recent years can be partly blamed on the ``self-centered''
ethics of students in the 1980s, educators and students were told
at a conference.
   Not only have colleges failed to teach students about ethics,
but the Reagan administration has undermined gains in civil rights,
contributing to a rise in racism, sexism and homophobia on
campuses, some educators said.
   ``There's been a reversal in students from the 1960s,'' said
Kenneth B. Clark, a psychologist and professor emeritus at the City
University of New York, who has researched the effects of
segregation on children. ``They are more self-centered and less
socially conscious.''
   The conference at Rutgers University was attended Friday by more
than 250 teachers, administrators and students from about 30 New
Jersey colleges. Sponsored by the state Department of Higher
Education and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, its
intent was to alert college leaders to the problems of intolerance
and suggest possible solutions.
   But the educators said recent student protests over minority
concerns at a number of colleges nationwide were encouraging.
   ``In part it's a good thing in the sense that it reflects a
determination by minority kids not to take this treatment,'' said
Meyer Weinberg, professor of Education at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, where students occupied an administration
building in February to protest campus racism.
   Those who attended the conference were treated to their own bit
of protest when a group of student demonstrators took the stage
even though the state's Chancellor of Higher Education, T. Edward
Hollander, refused them permission to speak.
   Hollander said later he was ``delighted'' to see them insist on
speaking out.
   ``I've waited 10 years for students to show that kind of
interest,'' he said.
   Hollander said organizers asked colleges to send students and
officials to the conference ``who hold the power'' to make campuses
aware of the state's effort to curb intolerance.
   The protesters spoke up after the keynote speech by Mayor Henry
Cisneros of San Antonio. They criticized the pace of reform and
said conference organizers failed to invite student and community
activists.
   ``We feel this is just a PR event to appease the community and
falsely give the sense that the colleges are resolving racist
relationships,'' said Salaam Ismail, coordinator of the Union of
African Organizations of Students, which represents colleges
statewide.
   The protesters had kind words for Cisneros, mayor since 1981,
who urged administrators to preach against intolerance and ensure
that graduates are able to contribute to a diverse society.
   He said changing demographics, rising immigration from Central
America, competition from Asian countries and a stagnant economy
require that Americans work together in a spirit of cooperation.
   Cisneros said students should gain an ``education in reality''
by volunteering for community service and that universities should
strive to develop minority leaders.
   Earlier Friday, in Williamstown, Mass., about 30 minority
students took over a dean's office at Williams College.
   A spokesman for the protesters said that black, Hispanic, Asian
and Polynesian students occupied Jenness House to protest what they
say is the administration's unwillingness to address minority
concerns at the prestigious liberal arts college.
   Also Friday, a group of minority students and University of
Vermont officials reached agreement to end the students' four-day
occupation of the college president's office. The agreement calls
for the university to increase the number of minority faculty
members and students.

<HEAD>Children Stabbed As Parents Take Part In Child Abuse Program</HEAD>

   A 10-year-old boy was stabbed to death and
two other boys were wounded as they waited in a van outside a
Christian TV station where their parents were participating in a
child abuse program, police said.
   Authorities had no suspects in what may have been a robbery
attempt Friday night, said Monroe police Lt. James Weems.
   Stephen K. Parker was killed in the attack. His brother, Chad M.
Parker, 11, was reported in stable condition early today at St.
Francis Medical Center. Benjamin J. Hobson, 11, was in intensive
care unit at St. Francis, reported in critical condition.
   The Parker boys were the sons of the Rev. Mike Parker of
Sterlington Assembly of God Church and his wife.
   The Parkers and Tommy Hobson, owner of the van and Benjamin's
father, were in the studio of KMCT-TV doing a gospel show's live
broadcast at the time, said Randy Self, the Parker boys' uncle.
   Self said Chad Parker heard someone knocking on the van door,
and, thinking it was his mother, opened the door and was stabbed in
the eye.
   He said Chad told him a second man also got into the van and
started stabbing the two other boys.
   Chad said one of the men asked how much money the boys had and
then said, ``I want it,'' Self said.
   Bill Snearly, former production manager for KMCT who lives in
the studio complex, said just before the stabbing he saw two males
walking toward the van in the parking lot.
   He quoted Chad as saying, ```When we opened the door, they
started stabbing us with butcher knives and hitting us with the
handles.''
   Snearly said Chad was covered with blood when he crawled into
the studio where his father was taking part in the broadcast about
child abuse.
   A Monroe policeman who had been called to the studio to unlock a
car arrived just after the stabbings, Snearly said.
   ``The officer actually caught the kid that died just as he was
stumbling out of the van,'' Snearly said.
   At the time of the stabbing, about 40 people were in the
television studio, which Snearly said was ``maybe 30 steps'' from
the van.
   Snearly said he was bewildered by the incident.
   ``They stole the boys' money,'' he said. ``Now, how much money
could they get off three kids that age.''

<HEAD>At Least 12 Die In Rebel Raid On Air Base</HEAD>

   Sinhalese rebels attacked the
country's main air force base and battled troops for four hours
before fleeing with stolen weapons. Officials said at least seven
rebels and five servicemen were killed.
   Also Friday, guerrillas from the same group raided a radio
station and stole communications equipment, authorities said.
   The military said the People's Liberation Front rebels ignited
bombs ``as diversionary measures'' and stabbed two guards Friday
night to enter Katunayake air base, 16 miles north of Colombo.
   The officials, who under briefing rules spoke on condition of
anonymity, said five rebels, 24 servicemen and four policemen were
injured in the air base battle, during which flights were halted at
the adjacent Colombo international airport.
   At least three rebels were captured, but their comrades managed
to escape with at least 30 Chinese made T-56 rifles and a machine
gun, the officials said.
   It was the rebel group's second attack on the air base. On June
8, a similar attack was repulsed.
   The rebels also attacked a radio station of the government-owned
Posts and Telecommunication Department, said Telecommunication
officer J.M. Peries. Peries said two employees were stabbed and
were in critical condition today.
   He said the rebels stole radio equipment, but some of it was
later recovered.
   The People's Liberation Front began as a radical Marxist group,
but now champions rights of the island's majority Sinhalese. It was
outlawed after a failed 1971 attempt to overthrow the government,
and regrouped in 1986.
   The front has opposed the July 29 peace accord between India and
Sri Lanka, which was aimed at ending the four-year separatist
rebellion by the minority Tamils. The front contends the accord
makes too many concessions to the Tamils and has vowed to kill
anyone who supports it.
   The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, compose about 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They claim they are discriminated
against by the Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the
population and control the government.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Minister Liable For Attack On His Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state district judge has ruled that Walker
Railey, a former prominent Methodist minister, ``maliciously and
brutally tried to strangle his wife'' in an attack that left her in
a coma.
   Judge John Whittington issued the judgment Friday in a civil
lawsuit filed by Peggy Railey's mother, Billie Jo Nicolai.
Whittington, quoting from the lawsuit, also ruled Railey
established a ``false alibi'' to cover his actions.
   The default judgment was announced a year and a day after Mrs.
Railey, 39, was found lying unconscious on her garage floor. She
has been comatose since the attack.
   Although he was served twice with the suit, Railey, 40, never
responded in court to the allegation that he attacked his wife,
though he has denied it out of court.
   ``If you bring allegations against the defendant and you give
the defendant notice of the allegations and an opportunity to come
in and respond to those allegations, and he refuses to do that, the
court can hold the defendant liable and hold those allegations as
true,'' said Bill Arnold, Mrs. Nicolai's attorney.
   Arnold said a jury trial should determine this summer the
damages Railey will be ordered to pay. Arnold said he will seek
actual damages for Mrs. Railey's past and future medical bills and
punitive damages for the pain and suffering of Mrs. Railey and her
family.
   Railey, the former senior minister at Dallas' First United
Methodist Church, has said he was doing research on the Southern
Methodist University campus the night his wife was attacked.
   After a suicide attempt following the attack, Railey refused to
talk with police and refused to answer questions before a grand
jury investigating the attack.
   Railey surrendered his ministerial credentials and moved to San
Francisco, where he rented an apartment with Lucy Papillon, a
psychologist who told a grand jury she had been seeing Railey
before the attack and that they had discussed marriage.
   The Raileys' two children are living with family friends in
Dallas.
   In his ``findings of fact,'' Whittington wrote ``that on or
about April 21, 1987, the defendant Walker L. Railey intentionally,
knowingly, maliciously and brutally attempted to strangle his wife
Peggy Railey to death.
   ``The Court further finds the defendant then left Mrs. Railey
for dead, left his two young children _ Ryan, age 5, and Megan, age
2 _ alone in the house without supervision, and drove to the
Fondren Library at Southern Methodist University in an attempt to
conceal his actions and to establish a false alibi for his
wherabouts at the time of the assault,'' the judge wrote.
   ``My clients are very pleased,'' said Arnold, who plans to
subpoena Railey for the trial and seek a warrant for his arrest.
   Railey's attorney, Doug Mulder, was not in his office or at home
when phoned for comment and did return messages.
   The civil judgment has no bearing on a criminal investigation
that officials say is stalled because of insufficient evidence.
Railey has not been charged with any crime, but his attorney
identified him as the chief suspect in the case.
   Investigators say they believe Railey is now in the Los Angeles
area.

<HEAD>Newsmen Detained After They Allegedly Enter Secure Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GROTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter and photographer for a Florida
newspaper were detained after they allegedly entered a 100-foot
restricted area around a submarine shipyard where a Trident sub was
scheduled to be launched today.
   Michael Romaner, photographer Stanley Badz and the skipper of
their boat, Kenneth Zelvin, were detained for more than two hours
Friday. The Coast Guard accused Zelvin's vessel of entering the
restricted area around Electric Boat Shipyard.
   The newsmen had chartered Zelvin's boat to take pictures of
submarines at the yard for The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville.
   Witnesses from the Coast Guard and Electric Boat reported the
boat entered restricted waters, which extend 100 feet into the
Thames River from the shipyard, Lt. Cmdr. James Rutkovsky said.
   ``We didn't know what we had. We didn't know if we had
terrorists, criminals or what,'' he said.
   Rutkovsky said officials were concerned because the Trident
submarine Pennsylvania was being prepared for launch today. Other
submarines in various stages of construction also are at the
shipyard.
   ``We weren't anywhere near 100 feet, we weren't even within 200
feet,'' Romaner said.
   A Navy intelligence officer confiscated the photographer's film.
Rutkovsky said if no sensitive portions of the shipyard are found
on the film it will be returned to the newspaper.
   The newspaper's executive editor, Fred Hartmann, tried to stop
the confiscation in a telephone call to the Coast Guard, Romaner
said.
   The Pennsylvania is the 10th ship in the Navy's Trident force.
It will carry a crew of 154 and be armed with 24 Trident II
missiles.
   The nuclear-powered Tridents, or Ohio Class submarines, are the
largest and most powerful in the Navy fleet. Electric Boat, a
division of defense giant General Dynamics Corp., is their sole
builder.

<HEAD>NASA Scientists Say Global Fires May Harm The Environment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMPTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fires set around the world to clear forests
and agricultural fields may cause long-term damage to the
environment, including depletion of the Earth's ozone layer, NASA
researchers say.
   Such ``biomass'' burning once was considered insignificant as a
global hazard, said Dr. Joel Levine, a senior research scientist at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Langley
Research Center.
   Concern about ozone depletion has focused on products of
industrialized nations, such as chlorofluorocarbons released from
aerosol sprays, refrigeration equipment and in the manufacture of
foam plastic containers.
   But Levine said Third World countries, where outdoor burning is
common, also may be contributing heavily to ozone depletion and the
creation of the so-called greenhouse effect, in which certain gases
in the atmosphere are believed to be raising temperatures on Earth.
   ``The conclusion of this work is that on the global scale, the
burning of forests and the burning of agricultural fields is a
very, very significant source of the most environmentally
significant gases,'' he told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. These
include nitrous oxide, nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, methane and
carbon monoxide.
   This could have important implications for ozone depletion,
since nitrogen oxides are believed responsible for about 70 percent
of the ozone destroyed in the stratosphere, Levine said.
   By comparison, chlorofluorocarbons and other manmade chlorine
gases account for less than 10 percent of the ozone destruction, he
said.
   A NASA team headed by Levine and atmospheric scientist Wesley
Cofer III is studying the extent and the content of fires to
determine their possible effects on the environment.
   The National Academy of Sciences has estimated that 2-5 percent
of the Earth's land surface is burned each year, a far greater mass
than thought a decade or so ago.
   Levine said satellite photos obtained from the Department of
Defense show that 5 percent may be a conservative estimate. The
nighttime photos, taken during the early- and mid-1970s and
recently declassified, reveal clusters of lights across sparsely
populated territory, such as Central Africa.
   These lights represent fires, Levine believes. By reviewing
hundreds of such photos this summer, Levine said the team hopes to
more closely determine the extent of burning.
   The researchers have studied individual fires in California,
Florida, Canada and elsewhere to determine the composition of smoke
and gauge the effect fires have on soil. Researchers found that
emissions of nitrous oxide and nitric oxide from the soil increased
tenfold after the fires.
   The soil emissions are released by microbes, tiny organisms that
find a feast of nutrients in the ash from the fires, said
microbiologist Penelope Boston.
   Ozone protects the Earth from the sun's harmful ultraviolet
rays. Scientists say ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth could
increase 5 percent to 20 percent by the early 21st century.
Potential hazards include increases in skin cancer rates and damage
to eyes.
   Biomass burning may have a similar effect in producing
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide,
Levine said.
   Greenhouse gases trap infrared heat in the Earth's atmosphere,
leading to global warming that could melt ice at the North and
South poles and lead to flooding of low-lying coastal areas.

   A man has been charged with robbery after he
allegedly held a hypodermic needle next to a woman's neck and
threatened to give her AIDS if she did not hand over her jewelry.
   Richard Colon, 23, of the Bronx told police after his arrest
Friday that he did not have acquired immune deficiency syndrome but
that he was an intravenous drug user, said Sgt. Maurice Howard, a

   Several needles were found in his possession before he was
charged, the spokesman said.
   The victim, Arelys Gonzales, a 21-year-old Bronx woman, told
police that Colon came up behind her on Monday night, held the
needle to her neck, said he had AIDS and would give it to her
unless she gave him her ring, earrings and watch, Howard said.
   She gave him the jewelry, valued at $500, he said.
   Gonzales recognized the man near there on Friday night and
called police, Howard said. The jewelry was not recovered.

<HEAD>PTL Says Tax-Exempt Status Revocation Won't Harm Donations At
First</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting to fix cycle designator</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The PTL television ministry says a
decision by the Internal Revenue Service to revoke its tax-exempt
status won't bring an immediate drop in donations to the
financially troubled organization.
   However, PTL officials, who are trying to reorganize the
ministry in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, have said the tax-exempt
status is essential to PTL's survival because it depends on
tax-deductible contributions to operate.
   The announcement Friday by the IRS office in Atlanta follows a
federal appeals court ruling Wednesday dissolving a preliminary
injunction that had prevented the IRS from revoking the tax-exempt
status.
   ``We felt the organization has not operated within the
guidelines ... in its original charter,'' said Les Witmer, a
spokesman for the IRS regional office.
   David Clark, PTL's court-appointed trustee, was not immediately
available for comment, PTL spokeswoman Linda Ivey said. But Ms.
Ivey said the ministry did not expect any immediate impact on
donations.
   ``The bulk of our support comes from people who are able to give
no more than $15 and $20 a month, and they're not losing a tax
deduction, at least not right away,'' she said.
   PTL already has applied for a new tax-exempt charter, and hopes
to be without the status of a non-profit corporation only ``for a
brief time,'' Assistant U.S. Trustee Joseph Buzhardt, whose office
is administering the reorganization, said after the IRS ruling
Friday.
   The IRS claims PTL owes more than $55 million in taxes from June
1983 to June 1987, the month PTL filed for protection from
creditors because of $72 million in debt, not counting the IRS
claim.
   The revocation is based on the IRS' examination of PTL's records
in bankruptcy court, Witmer said. PTL had ``excessive unrelated
business income or income which was not really in keeping with the
tax-exempt purpose,'' he said.
   An IRS report in December concluded that PTL founders Jim and
Tammy Faye Bakker and their aides profited excessively from
donations to the ministry. In addition, the IRS held that much of
PTL's Heritage USA theme park operations in Fort Mill were
commercial rather than ministerial.
   The Bakkers received $10.7 million in their last seven years
with the ministry, $9.4 million of which was excessive and
unreasonable, the IRS report said.
   Bakker resigned March 19, 1987, when a story was about to break
that he had had sex with former church secretary Jessica Hahn in
1980 and that the ministry had paid her $265,000 in hush money.
   A call to the Bakkers' home in Palm Springs, Calif., was
answered by a recording; a request for comment was not returned.
   An IRS statement said the agency ``can no longer assure
taxpayers of the deductibility of contributions to PTL.'' However,
it said past contributions are fully deductible.
   On Wednesday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Va., affirmed a lower court ruling that the bankruptcy court did
not have the authority to issue a preliminary injunction preventing
the IRS from revoking the ministry's tax-exempt status.
   Clark said the ministry may appeal. If so, contributions by
individuals would still be deductible up to $1,000 until the appeal
is decided, the IRS said.
   The government appealed the PTL reorganization plan approved
Dec. 29 by the bankruptcy court in Columbia and still opposes it.
The plan, which anticipated PTL would remain tax exempt, divides
the ministry into non-profit and for-profit corporations.

<HEAD>Woman Who Allegedly Drowned Infant Spent $20,000 To Correct
Infertility</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman charged with second-degree murder for
drowning her colicky 2-month-old son had run up about $20,000 in
medical bills to correct an infertility problem before she
conceived the child, her attorney says.
   Lucrezia Gentile was having trouble becoming pregnant and went
to a doctor who gave her a federally unapproved fertility drug,
said the attorney, John DePaola.
   Mrs. Gentile, 36, later had an operation to correct the problem
and became pregnant last year, he said Friday. He said her medical
bills exceeded $20,000.
   ``She conceived, but it was a difficult pregnancy and a
difficult delivery, by Caesarean section,'' he said.
   Child abuse experts see Mrs. Gentile as a victim, too _ a
prisoner of post-birth depression who received no help in handling
her problems.
   ``What's mind-boggling to me is the friends, family and
neighbors of this woman didn't see what was happening to this
mother,'' said Dr. Vincent J. Fontana, chairman of Mayor's Task
Force on Child Abuse and Neglect.
   ``Postpartum depression is a disease,'' he continued. ``It can
make a loving, caring mother feel like killing herself and her
baby.''
   Mrs. Gentile, 36, was ordered held on $75,000 bail Friday at a
Brooklyn Criminal Court hearing in the death two days earlier of
her infant son, Stephen.
   Mrs. Gentile called police Wednesday to report Stephen had been
kidnapped; a day later, she broke down during an FBI polygraph
test, told detectives about her son's death and gave them the
location of his body.
   Mrs. Gentile, a homemaker, was alone when the baby died. Her
7-year-old son, John, was at school; her husband, John, was at work.
   DePaola refused to comment on his defense strategy after the
bail hearing, where Mrs. Gentile was also barred from unsupervised
visits with her 7-year-old son.
   In a similar case three months ago, a Vermont woman was
acquitted by reason of insanity after her lawyers argued she
suffered from severe postpartum depression. Michelle Remington, 29,
shot her 6-week-old son with a .22 caliber handgun before trying to
kill herself.
   DePaola said his client ``had been on an emotional roller
coaster'' since 1984. Among her problems were an accidental
sterilization by a doctor, a subsequent operation to correct that
condition and the difficult birth, he said.
   Postpartum depression can cause crying spells in new mothers;
other symptoms include irritability, exhaustion, insomnia and
confusion about child care. Fontana estimated it strikes 70 percent
of mothers in one form or another.

   A chartered Swiss executive jet carrying
negotiators seeking the release of three French hostages took off
from Beirut airport today without any of the missing men, airport
officials said.
   The plane's arrival in Beirut from Larnaca, Cyprus, two hours
earlier fueled speculation it had come for the Frenchmen and their
release was imminent. The three have been held by Shiite Moslem
extremists since 1985.
   The airport officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they did not know the destination of the 12-seat Falcon 50 jet. But
radio monitors in Cyprus heard the pilot tell Larnaca tower he was
heading for Paris.
   A senior Beirut airport official said there were four French
negotiatiors aboard the Falcon 50 when it left Beirut today. He
said the four flew into Beirut Friday on the same jet, which spent
Friday night in Larnaca.
   ``None of the hostages was with them'' when they left Beirut,
the official said.
   The plane left Beirut today after radio reports said
negotiations to free the hostages had hit a snag, apparently after
the kidnappers made last-minute demands.
   Asked whether the latest effort to release the Frenchmen had
collapsed, the airport official said: ``I don't know. I can't
tell.''
   A source close to the command of a 7,500-man Syrian army force
in charge of security in Moslem west Beirut had said Friday night
that the French hostages would be released in ``a matter of
hours.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The three Frenchmen are diplomats Marcel Fontaine and Marcel
Carton and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann. Fontaine and Carton were
kidnapped separately March 22, 1985, Kauffmann two months later.
   A fourth Frenchman, researcher Michel Seurat, was kidnapped May
22, 1985. The extremist group Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, claimed
10 months later that it had killed him.
   Although no body has been found, Seurat's wife, Marie, said in a
book she published last month that French officials have told her
he died in captivity.
   Two other French hostages, photo-journalist Roger Auque and
television lighting engineer Jean-Louis Normandin, were released
Nov. 27 by Shiite kidnappers Nov. 27.
   The French government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has been
trying to free the three men before the first round of the French
presidential elections Sunday.
   In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners are
missing in Beirut. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a West
German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified
foreign men.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, Associated Press chief
Middle East corrpespondet, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Three Elementary Students Suspended For `Disruptive' Preaching</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents</NOTE>

   Three elementary school students who were
following their father's profession of street preaching were
suspended for disruptive behavior after they allegedly shouted at
other students and called teachers ``whoremongers.''
   Duffy Strode, 10, was suspended for five days, while Pepper
Strode, 7, and Matthew Strode, 5, were suspended for three days.
   ``I have pled with this man,'' school Superintendent David
Ricketts said of the children's father, David Strode. ``We've given
them every opportunity to comply with the rules. This is the fourth
or fifth violation.
   ``I know it looks crazy to suspend the kindergartner, but the
preaching is not the issue,'' Ricketts said.
   Strode said the children are not disruptive, that they are
``just preaching Scripture.''
   Eastfield Elementary principal Jim Gorst said the words may be
scriptural, but refererences to his teachers as whoremongers had
created some stress. The Scripture the children are using is
Hebrews 13:4, which says, ``Marriage is honorable in all, and the
bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.''
   The students, who were suspended Thursday, returned to their
preaching just outside the school gates twice Friday. But the
appearance of an officer from the McDowell County Sheriff's
Department _ requested by Gorst _ ended the preaching.
   Gorst said it was the first time in his seven years as principal
he had suspended a kindergartner.
   Gorst said the two boys and their sister were suspended for
disruptive behavior and refusing to come into the school building
between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. Thursday.
   The children, he said, were ``screaming. They were just
screaming at people.''
   David Stroke said he had contacted an attorney.
   ``They may be within their rights,'' Strode said of school
officials' suspension of the chidren. ``If they are, we'll just
have to take it.''
   School board attorney Penn Dameron, who had witnessed earlier
preaching by the children, said he found it disruptive.
   ``The children who are being yelled at were clearly disturbed,''
Dameron said. ``Eastfield has a policy against disruptive behavior,
and if children are being upset, we have to treat it as disruptive
behavior.''

much of the nation today, dumping rain, snow and hail along the way.
   The storm system tracked into central Illinois late Friday,
setting off thunderstorms early this morning from Illinois through
northern Indiana, into southern Michigan and northwest Ohio. The
storms were moving into western parts of Indiana and brought hail,
gusty winds and brief heavy rain.
   Illinois received the brunt of the storm activity Friday night.
A tornado touched down near Butler, destroying a barn. Hail the
size of golf balls pelted parts of northwestern Illinois, while in
Burbank, the ground was whitened by a deluge of hail.
   Severe thunderstorms also were reported across southern, lower
Michigan and northwest Ohio.
   Snow was scattered over southern Minnesota, southeastern South
Dakota and northern Nebraska. Meanwhile, highways over southwest
Minnesota were covered with slush Friday night, creating hazardous
driving conditions.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
lower Great Lakes through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys; possible
severe thunderstorms over parts of southern Indiana, central and
southern Ohio, southwest Pennsylvania, northern and western West
Virginia, Kentucky, Tenneessee, northwestern Alabama and northern
Mississippi; snow scattered from the upper Mississippi Valley into
Michigan; snow likely from eastern Minnesota through northern
Wisconsin and over the mountains of northern Arizona; showers
scattered over the northern and middle Mississippi Valley and
across the Southeast into the mid-Atlantic region; showers from the
Pacific Northwest into the central mountain region; and numerous
showers across central California.
   Highs will be in the 50s or 60s across much of the nation; in
the 30s from northern Minnesota into upper Michigan; in the 40s
from central Wyoming through Nebraska into the upper Great Lakes;
in the 70s across the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys into North
Carolina; in the 80s from western and central Texas through the
lower Mississippi Valley and southeastern states into Florida; and
in the low 90s across southern Texas and interior Florida.

   Mick Jagger half-sang, half-spoke some
of the Rolling Stones' greatest hits from the witness stand as he
tried to prove he didn't steal a song from a reggae musician.
   Jagger swayed to the beat and came close to singing Friday as he
recited for a judge, jury and fans who packed the courtroom,
``Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas.''
   Jagger was trying to show how he uses repetition in his lyrics,
as part of his defense against a charge by Patrick Alley, who is
suing for copyright infringement, claiming Jagger's 1985 solo hit
``Just Another Night'' was copied from his 1979 song of the same
name.
   The choruses in both songs use the phrase ``Just another night''
repeatedly.
   Jagger has denied he stole the song, which he said he didn't
hear until the suit was filed in 1986.
   He has testified for two days, playing tapes of the song as it
was written and arranged in 1983 and 1984 to try to show the
independent development of the piece.
   In Friday's session, he quoted lyrics from ``Brown Sugar,''
``Miss You,'' and ``Let's Spend the Night Together.''
   Jagger testified that repetition is common in popular music.
   Tapes were played of at least six different versions of the
tune, recorded in various places with various people in 1984. The
version that was released was recorded in May 1984 in Nassau, the
Bahamas, with a drummer named Sly Dunbar.
   Alley claims Dunbar played for his recording in 1979. Dunbar has
testified that he didn't remember whether he played for Alley or
not.
   Jagger testified that the title and lyrics to the song went
through a metamorphosis, starting with ``Another Night,'' and
``just another something else'' while he was ``messing around'' to
develop the music.
   He couldn't remember when he finished the lyrics or title.
   Jagger admitting playing reggae music with the late reggae
musician Peter Tosh, but said he didn't tend to listen to radio
stations that played that kind of music.
   He said he acknowledged works of other artists and paid them
royalties.
   Alley's lawyers have said Jagger's version netted as much as $6
million.
   The chorus of Alley's song goes, ``Can I spend another, just
another night, just another night, just another night with you.''
   Jagger's lines are, ``Give me just another night, just another
night with you. Give me just another kiss, just before the dawn
breaks through.''
   After his testimony, expected to continue Monday, Jagger signed
autographs and told reporters he thought the case was going well.

<HEAD>Ortega Accuses Washington Of Sending Arms In Violation Of Peace
Accord</HEAD>

   President Daniel Ortega accused the
United States of concealing arms in shipments of non-lethal aid to
rebels and said the White House is encouraging the military
hardliners in the Contra leadership.
   At a news conference Friday, Ortega also urged the United States
to resume negotiations on ``national security'' matters of mutual
concern, suggesting the first meeting be held May 15 in Mexico.
   The Nicaraguan leader said he was taking up President Reagan on
a promise of talks Reagan made in November when he told the
Organization of American States that Secretary of State George P.
Shultz was prepared to meet with Nicaraguan officials ``once
serious negotiations'' on a Nicaraguan cease-fire were under way.
   ``We have met with the Contras, there is a cease-fire, there is
an agreement and the time has come for the U.S. government to show
consistency by meeting with Nicaragua to discuss matters of
national security,'' Ortega said.
   He suggested the meetings begin May 15 at the Mexican west coast
resort of Manzanillo, where the two nations held talks that ended
unsucessfully in January 1985.
   Ortega said the leftist Sandinista government's ambassador to
Washington, Carlos Tunnerman, would deliver a formal proposal in a
few days.
   Ortega accused the United States of encouraging military
hardliners in the Contra leadership by deciding to give the rebels
non-lethal aid in violation of the preliminary peace accord his
government signed with the Contras March 23.
   He also claimed the United States was concealing weapons and
ammunition in shipments of humanitarian aid to rebels in Honduran
camps.
   The preliminary accord allows humanitarian aid to be distributed
through neutral international organizations, but only after the
rebels have settled in seven cease-fire zones inside Nicaragua
during the first half of May.
   Ortega said that non-lethal aid, most of it food, was already
being flown from Toncontin Airport in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, to camps controlled by Contra commanders who oppose the
cease-fire.
   An official of the U.S. Agency for International Development,
which is handling the shipments, said Thursday that the first
truckloads of food arrived at rebel camps inside Honduras this week.
   He said they were sent from Tegucigalpa after being inspected by
independent observers to make sure they did not contain arms.
   The March 23 preliminary peace accord signed in the southern
border town of Sapoa established a 60-day cease-fire than began
April 1 and during which both sides are charged with seeking to
negotiate a lasting peace in the 6{-year-old conflict that has cost
more than 26,000 lives.

   Amateur astronomers say bright lights atop a
new high-rise office building are preventing them from seeing stars
and planets.
   Members of the Amateur Astronomy Association of Pittsburgh say
the light shooting upward from the 31-story Fifth Avenue Place
amounts to ``light pollution.''
   Astronomers also claim the lights cause a haze that interferes
with their gazing miles from downtown.
   ``It's a nuisance,'' said Tom Reiland, president of the
250-member group. ``If you are an amateur who is hunting for comets
... a light like that could reduce your possibilities of being able
to discover (them).''
   Andy Gildersleeve, project manager of the building, said workers
were experimenting with the lighting. He said the lights' intensity
likely would diminish after experimentation.
   But he said it was likely the building would remain the
brightest in the city.

<HEAD>Attorney General Opens Formal Investigation Of Mecham Remarks On
Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona's attorney general has launched a
formal investigation into whether former Gov. Evan Mecham broke the
law when he urged supporters to ``have a lapse of memory'' about
their support for him if they become potential jurors at his
criminal trial.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin said Friday he decided to launch the
probe after first looking into whether Mecham's statements,
``assuming they are true,'' could be a violation of criminal
statutes.
   Mecham acknowledged Thursday he made the remark Monday during an
invitation-only Republican meeting, but said he was only joking.
   Told Friday that Corbin had decided on a formal investigation,
Mecham said ``I have no objection to his investigating anything he
wants'' and declined further comment.
   Corbin said the investigation will be to determine whether
Mecham violated one of several laws, including the solicitation
law, which prohibits asking somebody to commit or help commit a
crime.
   Corbin said he did not think the investigation would result in a
delay of Mecham's May 19 trial on six felony charges of fraud,
perjury and filing false documents for failing to report a $350,000
loan to his 1986 campaign. Mecham's brother and 1986 campaign
treasurer, Willard Mecham, faces three similar counts.
   On Thursday, Mecham told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview, ``Somebody asked if we could get a fair trial. I said
(no) unless we could get some people who were friendly that might
have a lapse of memory'' when they were questioned about whether
they could be impartial.
   ``I said it tongue-in-cheek. In fact, everybody laughed about
it,'' Mecham said. ``I'm not going to quit talking ... just because
we've got a bunch of people without a sense of humor.''
   Mecham was removed from office April 4 upon his conviction by
the Arizona Senate on impeachment charges that he attempted to
thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and that he
misused a protocol fund by loaning $80,000 from it to his car
dealership.

   Israel kept a tight curfew on at least 400,000
Arabs in the occupied territories today, which leaders of the
Palestinian uprising have designated a ``Day of Rage'' to protest
the assassination of a PLO leader.
   Violence broke out Friday during protests over PLO military
chief Khalil Wazir's slaying, and Israeli soldiers killed two Arabs
and wounded at least 36 in the occupied territories. In Jersualem,
police battled rioting Moslem worshipers on the sacred Temple Mount.
   The curfew, imposed on Monday, covered the West Bank towns of
Anabta and Nablus _ the area's largest town with more than 100,000
population _ and 20 Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   A total of 400,000 people were under curfew, according to Israel
radio.
   Arab ringleaders threatened to take revenge on merchants who
defied Palestine Liberation Organization orders to strike and
called on Arabs to turn the Moslem holy month of Ramadan into ``a
month of fury.''
   Wazir, better known by his nom de guerre Abu Jihad, was killed
one week ago at his Tunis home by commandos said to be Israeli.
   In the West Bank village of Idna near Hebron, soldiers killed a
28-year-old Arab Friday who tried to attack a border policeman with
a nail-studded club, the army said.
   Military officials said troops had entered Idna to search the
village.
   In the Gaza town of Khan Yunis, 25-year-old Fayez Abu Ali died
of a bullet wound to the head Friday, Nasser Hospital officials
said. The army said he was shot when troops fired on a car trying
to run over them.
   The fatalities brought to 171 the number of Palestinians killed
since unrest began Dec. 8 in territories Israel captured in the
1967 Middle East war. An Israeli soldier and a Jewish girl settler
have also been killed.
   The Temple Mount riot followed prayers on the first Friday of
Ramadan attended by about 10,000 worshipers at the Al Aqsa mosque
and the Dome of the Rock, where Moslems believe the prophet
Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   Police fired rubber bullets and swung truncheons to disperse
hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators.
   The Arabs carried outlawed Palestinian flags and black banners
and chanted, ``With our spirit and our blood, we will avenge Abu
Jihad!''
   Rubber bullets and beatings injured six Arabs and stones wounded
five policemen at the site, which is also sacred to Jews who say
the Second Temple stood there until Romans destroyed it in 70 A.D.
   More than 30 protesters were arrested, police said.
   Israel TV showed two protesters being carried out on stretchers.
   Leaftets bearing Wazir's picture and calling for more protests
today were distributed at West Bank mosques. Underground leaders
ordered Arabs to step up attacks with ``stones, gasoline bombs,
metal balls and slingshots.''
   Also Friday, Israeli warplanes blasted Palestinian guerrilla
bases in seaside hills south of Beirut in the sixth such raid into
Lebanon this year. Police said at least one fighter was killed and
eight wounded.
   After noon Moslem prayers, Israeli soldiers clashed with
protesters at several sites in the Gaza Strip.
   At Jabaliya refugee camp, 12 Arabs were wounded when soldiers
fired on protesters, and 18 others were hurt by rubber bullets and
beatings, U.N. and hospital officials said. Israel radio said 12
people were hurt.
   The army said soldiers used live ammunition after Jabaliya
residents defied a curfew and tear gas and rubber bullets failed to
disperse the crowd.
   Outside Omari Mosque in Gaza City, Israeli troops hurled tear
gas canisters and fired in the air when about 200 Palestinian
youths left prayers to throw rocks and chant, Arab witnesses said.
   In Ramallah and neighboring El Bireh on the West Bank, Israeli
troops patrolled the streets in trucks and jeeps. On the walls were
freshly painted slogans calling for avenging the death of Wazir.
   Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank's military
administration, said on Israel TV that the curfews in the occupied
lands would ``continue until we become convinced that the area will
return to normal life.''
   At the United Nations headquarters in New York, Soviet
Ambassador Alexander Belonogov on Friday accused Israel of state
terrorism in Wazir's death.
   He told the U.N. Security Council, ``It is but another example
of Israel's cynical contempt for world public opinion.''

   Moslem guerrillas claimed today that
they captured a strategic Soviet-Afghan garrison after a four-month
siege.
   The Peshawar headquarters of the seven-party Mujahedeen alliance
said Barikot, in Afghanistan's northeast Kunar province, fell
Friday. The alliance said the capture will boost their supply flow
over the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
   Spokesmen said the base and village were heavily fortified and
served as the headquarters of Communist Afghanistan's 55th army
brigade.
   The rebels, led by Commander Rahmatullah of the Hezb-i-Islami
Khalis faction reported that helicopters airlifted five infantry
and commando battalions before the insurgents overran the compound
around 1 p.m.
   Soviet and Afghan aircraft indiscriminately bombed and shelled
the Barikot area during the first stage of the attack, destroying
dozens of houses, guerrillas said.
   The rebels said 17 of their fighters died and 16 were wounded
but they had no casualty figures for Soviet-Afghan troops.
   Barikot lies just inside the Afghan border with northern
Pakistan.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the report but if
accurate, it would be a major victory for the anti-communist
guerrillas and would open a new direct supply route from Pakistan
of U.S., Saudi and Chinese weapons.
   Pakistan is a staging area for the Afghan resistance although
Islamabad has pledged in an April 14 Soviet troop withdrawal accord
to stop serving as an arms conduit when the agreement goes into
effect on May 15.
   Under the agreement, the Soviets agreed to withdraw its
estimated 115,000 troops over a nine-month period, beginning May
15. The Soviets intervened in December 1979.

   Eritrean rebels shelled Ethiopia's
biggest port and the country's only oil refinery, killing five
people and wounding 15, the Ethiopian News Agency said in an
unprecedented report on the civil war.
   Western diplomats said they believed the refinery was not
damaged, but were unsure about the port of Assab, which controls
more than 75 percent of this East African nation's imports and
exports, including emergency food relief for 7 million drought
victims.
   ``It sounds like the attack was nipped in the bud,'' said one
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. Diplomats said it was
believed to be the first rebel attack on the port.
   The state-run news agency reported Friday that the Ethiopian
navy blew up the boat from which rebels launched a night attack
Tuesday from the hilly island of Senabor, off Assab, 530 miles
northeast of Addis Ababa, the capital.
   Assab and Massawa, Ethiopia's only other major port, are in the
Eritrea province.
   The agency said the boat capsized with an unspecified number of
rebels on board. It gave no further details of the attackers' fate.
The agency also did not say if the refinery or port were damaged.
Nor did it indicate what type of weapons were used by the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front rebels.
   ``The refinery is a source of vital fuel for surface, air and
marine transport and for industrial development in general,'' the
agency said. ``The attempt of the bandits to destroy the refinery
clearly demonstrates their reckless aim of engaging in suicidal
missions.''
   The news agency also disclosed, in the first official report of
the attack, that rebels of the Tigrean People's Liberation Front
recently destroyed a microwave relay station connecting the
Eritrean capital, Asmara, to the rest of the country.
   The report of the Assab attack is the first of its kind since
President Mengistu Haile Mariam ended years of official silence
March 30 about the two insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   In his first admission that his government is at war, Mengistu
announced an offensive against the rebels, who have captured
several towns in major victories this year.
   There has been no official comment on an Eritrean rebel claim
that its guerrillas on Friday shot down a MiG-21 fighter jet and
captured the pilot.
   Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea, the clandestine rebel
radio, said the plane was downed during fighting northeast of
Asmara, in which it claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and
216 wounded in a battle Thursday.
   There were no foreign relief workers in Assab this week because
the government last week expelled about 60 Western relief workers
from Eritrea and Tigre, citing ``personnel risks'' in the war-torn
area.
   The expulsions have jeopardized a massive Western-funded
emergency relief operation to help an estimated 3.2 million people
threatened with starvation in Eritrea and Tigre, the provinces
worst hit by drought.
   This week, the government allowed four U.N. workers into Asmara
to supervise relief food distribution.
   Western diplomats and relief officials have criticized the
expulsions and say they fear the government wants to remove foreign
witnesses from the region as it prepares for all-out war.
   They have accused the government and rebels, all of whom are
Marxist, of jeopardizing the lives of drought victims in pursuit of
military victory.
   Secessionist Eritrean rebels have been fighting for 27 years in
Africa's oldest civil war. Rebels in Tigre took up arms 14 years

<TEXT>
   A pregnant woman shopping in a video store
with her three children was shot to death by a robber, authorities
said, but doctors were able to save her nearly full-term fetus by a
Ceasarean section delivery.
   The robber shot Anna Holmes, 31, of West Valley City as he was
leaving the video store Friday night, apparently because he was
unhappy with the amount of cash he had gotten, said Salt Lake
County Sheriff's Lt. Bernard Bailey.
   The gunman entered the Voyager Video store at 8:40 p.m., milled
around for a few minutes, then turned to the clerk and demanded
cash, Bailey said.
   The clerk complied, he said, but the robber grumbled about
wanting more money. He turned to leave, but as he left he pulled
out a small caliber, silver-colored handgun, put it to Holmes' head
and pulled the trigger.
   Witnesses told Bailey the man then said, ``That'll take care of
her.''
   The amount of cash taken was undetermined.
   In addition to the children whose ages ranged from 5 to 13 years
old, and the clerk, about eight other people witnessed the
shooting. All said it was unprovoked, Bailey said.
   Holmes was taken to Pioneer Valley Hospital and later
transported by helicopter to the University of Utah Health Sciences
Center, where she was pronounced dead, said nursing supervisor Lynn
Evans.
   Her daughter was delivered by Caesarean section and was in
critical condition, Evans said. The baby was about 32-34 weeks
along, which is almost full-term, but was suffering from lack of
oxygen.
   Witnesses described the gunman as in his 30s or 40s, about 6
feet tall with graying hair and wearing a plaid shirt and blue
jeans.Police searching for the man were preparing a composite
drawing from witness descriptions, deputies said.

   Photographic evidence of Jimmy Swaggart's
sins will be presented in court now that evangelist Marvin Gorman's
$90 million lawsuit against Swaggart has been revived, Gorman's
lawyer says.
   ``This case is about an attack made on Rev. Gorman. I think you
have to look at the credibility of the attacker to determine the
credibility of the attack,'' said Gorman's lawyer, Hunter Lundy.
   Louisiana's 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ordered a
lower court to hear Gorman's case against Swaggart, rejecting
arguments that it was purely a church matter that didn't belong in
the courts.
   The court said church doctrine requiring that charges against
Gorman be published within the Assemblies of God denomination did
not protect members who spread the accusations outside the church.
   Swaggart's lawyer, Phil Whittman, said he would appeal to the
state Supreme Court.
   Gorman's lawsuit, filed over a year ago, claims Swaggart falsely
accused him of adulterous affairs in an effort to bring down
Gorman's television ministry. Gorman resigned from the Assemblies
of God following the scandal. He admitted to a single adulterous
encounter in 1979, but said Swaggart's other accusations of
adultery were lies.
   Various sources have reported that earlier this year, Gorman
sent Assemblies of God leaders photographs of Swaggart outside a
suburban New Orleans motel with a prostitute. A woman who later
claimed to be that prostitute said Swaggart paid her to pose in the
nude.
   Lundy, while not saying what the photographs show, said he will
definitely use them along with other evidence gathered by private
detectives.
   ``It now appears that we will get our day in court and all the
facts will be presented to a jury of our peers, and I know we will
be exonerated from the lies published about me, my family and my
ministry,'' Gorman said.
   On Feb. 21, Swaggart confessed before his Baton Rouge
congregation to an unspecified sins and stepped down from the
pulpit. He said he would submit to the church's decree.
   But he left the Pentecostal denomination after the Executive and
General presbyteries ordered a one-year suspension from the pulpit
rather than the three-month one recommended by the Louisiana
District Council. He said he was not rebelling, but his ministry
and Bible college could not afford for him to be out of the pulpit
that long.
   Gorman said he had confronted Swaggart with his evidence in
October and given him four months to make himself clean with the
church before presenting the evidence against him.

<TEXT>
   ABC's ``General Hospital'' took time out for
a black-tie gala to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the super
soap opera and highest-rated daytime serial.
   Emily McLaughlin, one of two original cast members still with
the show, recalled the serial's humble beginnings, during the bash
Friday at the Ambassador Hotel's legendary Cocoanut Grove.
   ``When we started, I didn't think we were going to last 25
minutes let alone 25 years. It was very iffy,'' she said. ``We hit
No. 1 in 1968, and then we went down so far we were almost
cancelled.''
   The show, which made its debut on April 1, 1963, was first once
again in the most recent A.C. Nielsen ratings period.
   ``We had a wonderful time,'' recalled Jack Betts, who was on
``General Hospital'' during its first three years. ``(Actor) Johnny
Beradino had been a ball player and had never done a soap before.
Nor had I. We never thought it would last and John kept saying he'd
have to go back and play baseball again.''
   Betts said his character was written out of the show when he was
sent to South America to do medical research and never came back.
   ``General Hospital'' has a lot to celebrate. It's consistently
first in the daytime ratings, with guest stars like Elizabeth
Taylor, Milton Berle and Sammy Davis Jr., although it's locked in a
tight race with CBS' ``The Young and the Restless.''

   A fragile pedal-plane skimmed across a
74-mile stretch of the Aegean Sea from Crete to this Greek island
today to break the world record for human-powered flight, despite a
crash-landing.
   The pink-and-silver Daedalus 88, piloted by Greek national
cycling champion Kanellos Kanellopoulos, dropped into the surf just
off the black sands of Perissa beach, on the southeast face of this
volcanic island, also known as Thira.
   ``I was expecting the takeoff to be horrible but it went off
great, especially with the tailwind. The most turbulent area was
here at the end,'' said Kanellopoulos, still wet after his landing.
   A strong headwind about 30 feet from the beach forced the
72-pound plane to crash-land.
   ``He tried to pull up on the joystick to elevate the plane to
turn parallel to the beach to deal with headwind and then a gust
hit the hovering plane,'' said Glenn Tremml, the former world
record holder.
   Tremml, who witnessed the landing said the sudden movement
``broke the tail boom and then the wings folded and he gently
floated down. He dove out and swam to the beach with a huge smile
on his face.''
   Kanellopoulos, 30, was not injured, said Charles Ball, spokesman
for the Massasschusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass., which sponsored the project.
   Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue
craft had escorted the plane as it cruised 15 feet above the Aegean.
   The 36-member MIT team had waited three weeks on windy Crete for
a suitable day to attempt the flight.
   Daedalus flew the distance from Crete's Heraklion military
airfield in 3 hours, 54 minutes, faster than anticipated, and
landed at 11 a.m. (4 a.m. EDT). Project organizers had estimated a
flight time of at least five hours at a speed of around 14 miles an
hour.
   Officials at Heraklion airport attributed the quicker flight to
a 3- to 4-knot tailwind.
   Daedalus 88 broke two records.
   First it shattered the mark for straight-line human-powered
flight set in 1979, when Bryan Allen pedaled the Gossamer Albatross
22.5 miles across the English Channel.
   Then it broke the world record for human-powered flight, set by
a Daedalus 88 prototype, Light Eagle, which flew 37.2 miles around
Edwards Air Base in California in January 1987.
   Kanellopoulos smiled at reporters as he waited for the all-clear
to take off in Crete.
   ``The flight belongs to MIT and Greece. We together are going to
realize and keep the myth. And of course this is the best way to
visit Santorini,'' he said as he was being sealed into the
ultra-light plane.
   Essential requirements for the flight were a calm sea, southerly
winds of less than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degrees and
visibility to the horizon, according to Steve K. Bussolari, an MIT
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations.
   The flight also was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth
of Daedalus, said to have flapped his way across the Aegean from
Crete on wings of feathers and wax. Daedalus landed safely but his
son Icarus flew too close to the sun. The wax of his wings melted
and he plummeted to the sea and drowned.
   Had the plane not made it, two similar backup planes would have
been assembled for another record flight attempt before mid-May,
when the weather turns too hot for human-powered flying.
   Three other athlete-pilots had been taking turns standing by for
48 hours each in readiness for a possible record flight.
   They are Francis Scioscia, 27, of Scranton, Pa., and Greg Zack,
26, of Wilmington, N.C., and Tremml, a 27-year-old New Haven, Conn.
medical student.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze has
rejected an invitation from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
to visit the Jewish state later this month.
   ``We have no plans for the time being to make such a visit to
Israel because the conditions are not ripe yet. We do not have a
diplomatic relationship yet,'' Shevardnadze told a news conference
Friday.
   Shamir said in an interview last Sunday that he would welcome a
Shevardnadze visit to Israel to discuss normalizing relations and
the emigration of Soviet Jews. The premier said Shevardnadze could
stop in Israel during a trip to the Middle East later this month.
   The Soviet Union broke relations with Israel to protest its
occupation of Arab lands in 1967. The Kremlin insists that Israel
withdraw from that territory before relations are normalized.
   Shevardnadze refused to confirm reports he plans to visit the
Middle East this month, but added: ``I have some secrets of my own
and I would not like to divulge them at this time. If circumstances
call for such a visit then I will be ready to go.''
   The Soviet ambassador to Cairo, Gennady Zhuravlev, said
Wednesday Shevardnadze accepted an invitation to visit Egypt but
did not say when the trip would be scheduled. Unconfirmed reports
originating in the Middle East have said Shevardnadze also would
visit Jordan and Syria.

<HEAD>28 Crew Members Still Missing as Greek Tanker Burns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities scaled down an air
and sea search today as hope dwindled for finding any survivors
among the 29 people who were aboard a Greek tanker that broke up in
a fire.
   Seven merchant ships helping to scour the area about 370 miles
southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, were told today they could
abandon the search, said Petty Officer Brad Terrill of the U.S.
Coast Guard in New York.
   Early today, the stern of the 18,000-ton tanker was still
ablaze. The bow sank Friday in rain squalls and winds exceeding 55
mph that whipped up 5-foot swells.
   On Friday night, searchers recovered the badly burned body of a
crewman, Andrej Szukalski, 41, of Poland. The other 28 people
aboard _ 23 Polish sailors and five of their wives _ remained
missing.
   The 500-foot Athenian Venture, which was carrying gasoline from
Amsterdam to New York, apparently exploded and caught fire early
Friday.
   The Cypriot-registered tanker was owned by Patron Marine of
Athens.
   The recovered body, which was wearing a lifejacket, carried the
ship's logs. The logs gave no indication of what had happened on
the vessel.
   Rough seas and rain squalls hampered searchers Friday, but the
weather cleared overnight. Skies were overcast today, but winds
were calm, Terrill said.
   Terrill said the Hudson, the Canadian research vessel that first
spotted the burning tanker, will continue searching for possible
survivors today. A Canadian Forces patrol plane was scanning the
seas and would be rejoined by two American C130 Hercules from North
Carolina later today.
   Vessels using the shipping lane were being asked to be on the
lookout for the remaining 28 missing crewmembers.

<HEAD>Pitts Get Temporary Custody of Navajo Baby Allysa Pending
Guardianship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AssociatedPress Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUBA CITY, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement short of adoption has been
struck in the case of a Navajo baby that will lead to permanent
guardianship by a non-Indian San Jose, Calif., couple and
visitation rights by the mother.
   In the end, all parties agreed, it was Baby Allyssa who won.
   The agreement struck Friday among Navajo officials, Patricia
Keetso and Rick and Cheryl Pitts of San Jose, Calif., granted the
couple temporary custody of the 9-month-old Navajo daughter of Ms.
Keetso pending tribal court proceedings to give them permanent
guardianship.
   Under it, Ms. Keetso will retain her parental and visitation
rights, and the tribe's concern that Allyssa be given an
identification with her Navajo heritage and culture will be
assured, said Anslem Roanhorse, director of the Navajo Division of
Social Welfare.
   Tribal authorities also gave it their approval, after 4{ hours
of negotiations involving Navajo Tribal Children's Judge Manuel
Watchman, lawyers, a legal advocate for the child, tribal social
welfare officials and others.
   ``I feel wonderful,'' Pitts told reporters, saying the effort
that had begun as an adoption proceeding in California
``definitely'' was worth going through.
   ``The anguish and pain and confusion felt, I'm sure, by the
Pittses, the natural mother, the family members have hopefully come
to an end,'' said Roanhorse. ``Perhaps now the healing process can
begin.''
   Roanhorse said the case set a precedent in upholding the rights
of extended family members.
   Pitts expressed satisfaction with the compromise, which he said
``was nothing more than our original intentions.''
   Mrs. Pitts said, ``I think things could have been done in a
different way if somebody had just listened to us,'' but added that
she was not bitter and was happy to be going home ``with our
daughter.''
   Attorney Michael C. Nelson, who represented the Pitts couple and
Ms. Keetso, said permanent guardianship means the Pittses'
relationship with Allyssa Keetso's biological mother would not have
to end, as it would under adoption.
   However, Nelson said, once the permanent guardianship is
granted, Ms. Keetso would not be able to come back and claim
custody of the child. Guardianship proceedings will begin within
the next four months, he added.
   The agreement grants liberal visitation rights to the biological
mother and other members of the baby's extended Indian family.
   The Pittses, both 33, were in the process of adopting Allyssa
with the approval of Ms. Keetso when the Navajo Tribal Courts
intervened. Federal law gives tribal courts jurisdiction over the
adoption of Indian children by non-Indians in certain instances.
   Nelson said the couple wanted to adopt Allyssa and give her
mother visitation rights, but tribal officials say adoption would
sever the child's link with the tribe. Navajo law places strong
emphasis on extended family.
   Under a guardianship, parental rights would remain with the
biological mother even though the Pittses would raise the child.
The couple would be legally considered the parents if they adopt
the child.
   Ms. Keetso, 21, was pregnant and single when she contacted the
Pittses through a newspaper ad. She lived with the San Jose,
Calif., couple for two months before and one month after Allyssa
was born and said she wanted the couple to adopt her daughter.
   The child's maternal grandmother, Susie Keetso, also has said
she wants the child to be turned over to the San Jose couple.
   Tribal officials have said they intervened after Mrs. Keetso
expressed ``strong interest'' in having the child raised at the
reservation. But earlier this week, Mrs. Keetso said she had been
threatened with jail if she did not allow the tribe to intervene in
the case.

<HEAD>Three Youths From Massachusetts Fined After Assault On Waiter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three college students from
Massachusetts have been fined a total of $1,300 for assaulting a
waiter at a Bermuda hotel after he told them to stop throwing doves
into a swimming pool.
   Arthur Anthony Guidara, of Boston, Gregory Patrick Long, and
Robert Thomas Norton, both of Dorchester, Mass., pleaded guilty to
assault and causing grievous bodily harm and were fined at a
magistrate court hearing on Thursday.
   The men, all 18, allegedly attacked waiter Edward Redman, 26,
and beat him unconscious at the Flamingo Beach Club on April 19.
   Redman had approached the three vacationing Americans after one
of them had thrown two caged doves into the hotel swimming pool.
   Redman, who is still recovering in the British colony's King
Edward VII Hospital, suffered a fractured cheekbone, damage to an
eye muscle and facial cuts which took 23 stitches to close.
   Redman said the sentences were lighter than many handed down for
traffic offenses. He claimed that his hospital bill is likely to be
higher than the fines. As a result of his injuries he wil have to
fly to Washington, D.C., next week for eye surgery.
   ``I was very saddened to hear details of a fine,'' Redman, said
from his hoptial bed today.
   Senior prosecutor Robin McMillan said, ``The beating was an
atrocious act.'' He said a short prison term would not be out of
place.
   The maximum penalty was a year in jail or fines of up to $1,500
each.

<HEAD>Three Solidarity Leaders Reported Detained</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plainclothes police, seeking to prevent a
meeting of the outlawed trade federation Solidarity, have detained
three of its leaders, opposition activists said today.
   Jerzy Dluzyniewski, a member of Solidarity's National Executive
Commission, was arrested today at his house. Police told him he was
being detained 48 hours ``for his own good'' to prevent an illegal
meeting, said Joanna Onyszkiewicz, wife of Solidarity's national
spokesman, Janusz Onyszkiewicz.
   The other two detained leaders were Wladyslaw Frasyniuk and
Stefania Hajmanowska. They are also members of Solidarity's
Executive Commission, chaired by union leader and 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Lech Walesa.
   Frasyniuk was detained today, said Solidarity spokeswoman
Barbara Labuda in Wroclaw. Ms. Hajmanowska was detained Friday,
according to Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Solidarity leader in Warsaw
who monitors human rights cases.
   Walesa declined comment over the telephone from his home in
Gdansk about any plans for a meeting. Solidarity leaders presume
their phone conversations are monitored by police.
   Solidarity was declared illegal after Poland's 1981 martial law
crackdown, but its leadership has remained active, especially since
a 1986 political amnesty.
   Authorities frequently use fines and brief detentions to counter
union activities, but no lengthy jail sentences of senior union
leaders have been imposed since the amnesty.
   Meanwhile, police broke up an illegal printing operation in the
western copper-mining town of Glogow, Ms. Labuda said today.
   Printing equipment and some underground publications were
confiscated after a search of five private apartments that lasted
six hours, she said. The five Solidarity activists whose apartments
were searched were released but told they will likely face
misdemeanor charges.

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Fidel Castro Wants Normal Relations With United

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro praised nuns, the pope and showed
he ``definitely is reaching toward the church'' as he met for four
hours with Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the church leader says.
   O'Connor, the first Roman Catholic cardinal to visit Cuba since
Castro gained power in 1959, also said Castro indicated he would
release up to 350 political prisoners if the United States were to
give them visas.
   Castro asked for the church to see if it could play a role in
smoothing the way for arrangements, and O'Connor said he ``told him
we would be happy to do this.''
   And the Cuban leader also indicated he wants to restore normal
diplomatic relations with the United States, O'Connor said at a
news conference at LaGuardia Airport after he returned Friday from
his four-day trip.
   Officially, O'Connor went to Cuba as a guest of the Catholic
Church to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of the Rev.
Felix Varela, who served in New York City from 1823 to 1853.
   When O'Connor asked Castro if he could clear the way for
Americans to visit sick relatives in Cuba, Castro said that would
be no problem at all, the cardinal said.
   At one point, O'Connor said he asked Castro for four more visas
for Mother Teresa's Missionary Sisters of Charity.
   ``The instant I proposed it, he expressed great delight and
granted (the visas) at that moment. He then went into great praise
of the nuns in Cuba. I've never heard nuns praised so highly,'' he
said.
   Castro also ``went into great praise of the pope and said he's
certainly the world leader in terms of peace and in terms of
constantly speaking about the poor,'' O'Connor said.
   ``I don't think there's any question that, for whatever motive,
he's beginning to feel the needs of the church,'' O'Connor said of
the Cuban president.
   Although Castro was friendly, O'Connor said he was ``thinking
all the time'' about whether the political figure was trying to
exploit him.
   At first during their talks, Castro ``gave me an extensive
tirade against the United States. He told me he has long since
learned to do without the United States,'' O'Connor said.
   But he said he later got the feeling that ``he (Castro) would be
delighted to re-establish a normal relationship'' with the United
States.
   O'Connor said he expected that normal relations would include a
resumption of trade and discussions at a diplomatic level as well
as ``within a very short period of time the free flow of people
going back and forth.''
   And the possibility of greater openness toward the church also
seemed a prospect in the Soviet Union, which is considering
allowing O'Connor to celebrate a Christmas Mass in Moscow to be
broadcast to a national audience, he said.
   The New York prelate first mentioned the proposal Thursday at a
news conference in Havana.
   The cardinal said he would prefer such a Mass on New Year's Day,
so he could continue the tradition of celebrating midnight
Christmas Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   A televised Mass in the Soviet Union would be ``another move
toward building a bridge,'' O'Connor said. ``The bridge has to be
built. It may be a year. It may take a century.''

   It's butts out for about 80 percent of all domestic flights
today, but airlines and experts have some healthy advice for
inveterate smokers climbing the cabin walls: Take deep breaths,
chew gun and snap a rubber band.
   The federal ban on smoking on domestic flights of less than two
hours went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT today.
   ``I'll just have to smoke like a fiend until I get on,'' said
Linda Navarro of Fullerton, Calif., as she prepared to board a
flight at Los Angeles International Airport.
   The regulation carries more than a wrist slap for violators: a
fine of up to $1,000 for smoking and $2,000 for tampering with
aircraft lavatory smoke alarms.
   Those who disobey a flight attendant's order to put out a
cigarette could land in jail. Airlines say they may ask police to
meet the plane at its next destination, or even divert the aircraft
in cases involving unruly smokers.
   ``The majority of us absolutely support the new law,'' USAir
flight attendant Suzanne Haughton told the Los Angeles Times. ``I
don't look forward to the conflicts that will come with it, though.
There are going to be problems. There are passengers who rip your
head off on a 28-minute flight if they can't smoke.''
   ``I'm thrilled. I'm so happy. I just can't breathe anymore on
these flights,'' United Airlines flight attendant Terry Cale said
in San Francisco. ``I'm afraid to go to the doctor to have my lungs
examined for fear of what they'll find.''
   Not everyone was as thrilled. ``Flying is already stressful
enough, and now they're going to make it worse if they won't let me
smoke up there,'' said Lother Straschnitzki of Sonoma, Calif.,
waiting for his flight to be called at San Francisco International
Airport. ``It's going to bother me a lot.''
   ``I survived,'' said Tom Brand of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who lit
up the minute he stepped off his Delta flight from Fort Lauderdale
to Atlanta.
   But the hopelessly hooked needn't despair. The airlines plan to
offer substitutes for cigarettes, including hard candy and a
chewing gum designed to lessen withdrawal symptoms.
   Dr. Don R. Powell, executive director of the American Institute
for Preventive Medicine, advises putting a rubber band around the
wrist of your smoking hand and snapping it whenever a nicotine urge
strikes.
   ``Our employees have been briefed,'' said Paula Musto, a
spokeswoman for Eastern Airlines. ``The flight attendants, as the
front-line people, will have to deal with it more than anybody.''
   Under the new rules, airlines are required to announce before
takeoff that smoking is prohibited, and to keep ``No Smoking''
lights illuminated.
   Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes
beyond two hours, smoking will be prohibited if the schedule lists
it as lasting two hours or less, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   American Airlines is providing cinnamon hard candies to smokers,
suggested by the American Heart Association and the American Lung
Association as a cigarette substitute. Continental Airlines is
distributing more than 430,000 pieces of a gum called ``Ban
Smoke,'' formulated to temporarily control the urge.
   Northwest Airlines, whose anti-smoking policy goes beyond the
federal requirement by banning smoking on nearly all domestic
flights, is handing out candies and mints as well as brochures.
   From United Airlines, here are some suggestions from medical
director Dr. Gary Kohn:
   _If you usually smoke while sipping coffee, soft drinks or
alcohol during flights, try switching to fruit juices, water or
milk.
   _Strike up a conversation with a fellow passenger instead of
striking a match. Write letters or a business memo.
   _Practice deep breathing.
   _Read a book or a magazine.
   The American Institute for Preventive Medicine, based in
Southfield, Mich., has also developed a kit, called ``Flying
Smokeless,'' that contains a cassette tape of behavior modification
techniques and a ``smokeless emergency pack'' containing gum, mints
and toothpicks. It sells for $11.45.
   The Great American Smokers Club, a charter service that was to
begin service Friday from Dallas and permit smoking in all seats,
has been forced to postpone service because of complications with
federal regulations, company executives said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused President Reagan of
wrongly claiming superpower relations had warmed thanks to U.S.
pressure on the Soviets and suggested Reagan stop sermonizing, the
official Tass news agency reported today.
   The agency said Gorbachev told Secretary of State George P.
Shultz Friday that despite recently improved superpower relations,
``sermons are again being delivered to us and we are being
instructed on how we should behave ourselves.
   ``Everything that has been achieved in Soviet-American relations
is being ascribed to the policy of strength and `putting pressure
on the Soviets,''' the Soviet leader told Shultz, according to the
agency.
   Gorbachev was apparently referring to a foreign policy speech
given by Reagan Thursday in Springfield, Mass.
   In it, the president said the United States and Soviet Union
cannot have ``a normal relationship'' unless Moscow changes its
ways and stops intervening in nations such as Afghanistan.
   After his meeting with Gorbachev, Shultz told reporters ``the
going is hard'' in trying to conclude a treaty for sharply reducing
long-range nuclear weapons that Reagan and Gorbachev could sign at
their May 29-June 2 summit in Moscow.
   Today Shultz took a side trip in the Ukraine to visit the sites
of a stalled U.S. consulate and a World War II German atrocity.
   ``We have to say to ourselves always, never again,'' Shultz said
in a tribute to the 30,000 Jews and 70,000 Ukrainians who were
herded into a ravine at Babi Yar and machine-gunned by the Nazis.
   The consulate in Kiev, the third-largest city in the Soviet
Union, was supposed to have opened by now, but construction has
been halted and there is no target date for completion.
   U.S. officials cite security concerns, a tighter budget and
Congressional opposition. Also, the Soviets would have a reciprocal
right to open a consulate in New York, which troubles some members
of Congress and some State Department officials.
   In talks Thursday and Friday with Soviet leaders, Shultz sought
to make headway on arms control problems and regional disputes. In
a joint statement Friday, the U.S. and Soviet teams said
negotiators would deal with the disputed issues ``on a priority
basis.''
   They reaffirmed their ``strong commitment to make an intensive
effort'' to complete the treaty and said the summit ``should mark
another important step in the process of building a more stable and
constructive relationship.''
   Shultz was also scheduled today to visit Tbilisi, stop in
Brussels to brief the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Monday,
then fly home. He is to hold another session with Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze before the summit.
   A strategic arms reduction treaty would crown Reagan's fourth
and probably final meeting with Gorbachev as president.
   At a news conference, Shevardnadze said he could not promise an
arms treaty before Reagan's visit and he criticized any attempt to
rush negotiations. He suggested that without a treaty, Gorbachev
and Reagan could still sign a document stating progress toward an
accord.
   While U.S. arms negotiators offered a new proposal in a dispute
over air-launched cruise missiles, the treaty to sharply reduce
U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons was still stymied in a
dispute over ``Star Wars.''
   The U.S. proposal would count as nuclear weapons all cruise
missiles carried by fighter planes even though some may be
conventionally armed. Both sides would have the right to develop
air-launched cruises that were not nuclear, and the weapons would
not be covered by the treaty.
   The idea is to bypass a dispute over verifying which of the
cruise missiles carry nuclear arms.
   The Soviets agreed to study the proposal, a senior U.S. official
said at a briefing for reporters under rules of anonymity.
   Another major stumbling block in completing the treaty is
finding ways to monitor U.S. and Soviet weapons to make sure
cutbacks are not circumvented.
   On the regional front, the Soviets again refused to heed
Shultz's appeal for the United Nations to declare an arms embargo
against Iran.
   Since the Soviets have veto power on the U.N. Security Council,
this means the United States is unable to move for U.N. sanctions
against Iran. The idea is to try to force compliance with a
cease-fire ordered by the council last July in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Shultz also could not persuade the Soviet Union to restore
diplomatic relations with Israel after a 21-year break or to pledge
to increase Jewish emigration, another U.S. official said.

<TEXT>
   A TNT-laden pickup truck exploded today
in a crowded vegetable market in the northern port city of Tripoli,
killing at least 50 people and wounding 80 others, police said.
   The 8:45 a.m. (2:45 a.m. EDT) explosion knocked down several
buildings, gutted shops and set fire to dozens of cars in the
low-income Tabbaneh district of Lebanon's second largest city, 50
miles north of Beirut.
   The explosion occurred as Moslem shoppers filled the market on
the seventh day of the holy month of Ramadan, when observing
Moslems fast during daylight hours.
   It was the worst car bombing in Lebanon in nearly three years.
   Police said the pickup, apparently used to transport vegetables,
had been loaded with about 220 pounds of TNT.
   No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, and police
said they had no clue as to who was to blame.
   Civil defense teams dug through the rubble looking for trapped
people.
   ``It was a real massacre. Several pedestrians and vendors were
torn to pieces,'' said a police spokesman, who could not be
identified under standing regulations.
   He said Syrian troops in charge of Tripoli's security cordoned
off the blast area as ambulances with wailing sirens took
casualties to hospitals.
   Car bombs are a by-product of Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war
between Moslems and Christians. More than 100,000 people have been
killed since fighting broke out in 1975.
   A car bomb exploded outside an ice cream parlor in Tripoli on
June 29, 1985, killing 50 people and wounding 110 as they
celebrated the Fitr feast marking the end of Ramadan.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, condemned
today's car bombing as a ``barbaric atrocity.''
   ``All hands must team up to stop these executioners from
committing further such crimes,'' he said.
   The city has a predominantly Sunni population of 850,000.
   There have been four bombings in Beirut and Tripoli in the last
three months in which five people have been killed and 15 wounded.
But police said none of them involved a car rigged with explosives.
   At least 57 people were killed and 288 wounded in 16 car
bombings in Lebanon last year.

   Police raided seven bars and
nightclubs and rounded up about 80 Filipino barmaids and dancers
and six foreigners in a crackdown on prostitution and illegal
aliens, police said Saturday.
   Police said the four Britons and two Australians were arrested
and detained pending deportation proceedings. They were accused of
either managing or owning bars without valid business visas.
   The Friday night raids in the Ermita tourist district brought to
about 2,000 the number of people, mostly women, rounded up since
Manila police chief Brig. Gen. Alfredo Lim began cracking down last
month on establishments he claims are fronts for prostitution.
   Lim said the women, officially listed as waitresses,
receptionists and dancers, were released after medical checkups. He
said up to 80 percent of them were found to be infected with
sexually transmitted diseases.

<TEXT>
   A socialite dubbed the ``fugitive
temptress'' who allegedly seduced her lover into arranging her
husband's murder, then ran away with another man, also captivated
the investigator assigned to hunt her down.
   But for different reasons.
   Mary Naomi Cloud, 45, formerly of Princeton, was apprehended
late Thursday in Kennewick, Wash., after spending six years running
from charges that she killed her husband.
   ``Well, she finally spent a night in jail. I waited a long time
for this,'' a jubilant Don Meadows, an investigator for the Mercer
County prosecutors office, told the Bluefield Daily Telegraph
before heading back to West Virginia today with Mrs. Cloud in
custody.
   Meadows said he and other authorities captured Mrs. Cloud as she
tried to slip out the back door of her house. Authorities traveled
to Washington after receiving a tip.
   ``She looked totally shocked,'' he said. ``She was very upset.
She didn't say a word to me after we arrested her. Just gave me the
dirty looks she used to give me before.''
   Mrs. Cloud was charged with being a fugitive during a hearing
Friday, said Benton County (Wash.) Sheriff Jim Kennedy. Bond was
set at $100,000 and she waived extradition proceedings, officials
said.
   She had been charged with first-degree murder of her husband,
David, who was gunned down in the yard of their home as the couple
returned from a dinner party in Bluefield on Jan. 26, 1980. David
Cloud, 56, was vice president of Carter Machinery Co.
   Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her boyfriend at the time,
John Elmer Corprew Jr. of Roanoke, Va., into the plot to kill her
husband, and Corprew in turn paid George Guthrie II of Roanoke
$2,500 to be the triggerman.
   Corprew testified that Mrs. Cloud ``was like a spider and I was
caught in her web.''
   Corprew was sentenced to one to five years in prison for
voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea bargain and was released
after eight months. Guthrie was convicted of first-degree murder in
1984 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturned
by the state Supreme Court, but he was convicted of the same charge
and received the same sentence again.
   Mrs. Cloud contended that her husband was shot in the face by a
masked robber who emerged from the darkness as they returned from
the dinner party. Mercer County Prosecutor David Knight said he
became suspicious of her story, questioning why the man hadn't
robbed their house, why Mrs. Cloud had been spared and why the
assailant fled without taking any valuables.
   After she was indicted, Mrs. Cloud moved to Huntington, where
she worked as a car saleswoman and became romantically involved
with Bernie D. Stanley, authorities said. She and Stanley fled just
before her trial was to begin on May 17, 1982, officials said.
   Mrs. Cloud had put up as her bond a $50,000 building she owed in
Princeton, but prosecutors said she sold the building before
fleeing.
   Meadows said West Virginia authorities showed neighbors pictures
from Mrs. Cloud's wanted poster and staked out her house once they
determined the tip was accurate.
   Authorities nabbed Mrs. Cloud as she tried to walk out the back
door while her boyfriend talked to police at the front door,
Meadows said. Stanley was not arrested and faces no charges, he
said.

<HEAD>Severed Heads Found Where Gurkha Separatists Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The severed heads of two unidentified
people were found in the Darjeeling region, where Gurkha militants
have been campaigning for a separate homeland in eastern India.
   The United News of India said the heads were found Friday in
front of the office of the government-owned State Bank of India at
Sonada, 15 miles west of Darjeeling town.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Gurkha
militants were blamed for two similar beheadings earlier this month.
   On April 6, the severed head of school principal Dileswar Rai
was found at the road crossing in Kalimpong. Rai had defied the
Gurkha call for a strike and kept his school open.
   The severed head of Nirmal Rai, a reporter for a local
newspaper, was found at the same place on April 12. The reporter,
not related to the principal, was accused of being a police
informer.
   The attack on the teacher was claimed by the Gurkhaland
Liberation Tigers, one of several Gurkha rebel groups. Police also
blamed Gurkha militants for the reporter's death.
   The Gurkhas, who are Indians of Nepalese descent, say they want
a state of their own to protect their culture, language and
tradition. The Darjeeling region now is part of Marxist-governed
West Bengal state.
   At least 275 people have since the Gurkhas began their homeland
campaign in April 1986.

<HEAD>Battle Between Two Railroad Unions Flares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internecine battle between two unions
representing most of the nation's operating railroad personnel is
flaring just as both are sitting down with the industry to open a
new round of contract talks.
   Fred Hardin, president of the 88,000-member United
Transportation Union, said in an interview he is launching an
effort to take over the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers ``with
or without its consent.''
   Larry McFather, president of the 28,000-member BLE, accused
Hardin of ``engaging in an outright raiding campaign against our
union'' and vowed an appropriate response that might include
abandoning the UTU to its own devices at the bargaining table.
   The Locomotive Engineers, whose members are the highest paid
among unionized rail workers, last week voted to affiliate with the
AFL-CIO, breaking a 125-year tradition of staying aloof from such
alliances.
   ``The BLE has gone into a cave of protection,'' said Hardin, who
pulled his own union out of the AFL-CIO two years ago when the
labor federation was preparing sanctions against it for trying to
snare 2,000 Amtrak workers away from other unions.
   The AFL-CIO's constitution prohibits its affiliated unions from
seeking to acquire the members of any other union allied with the
federation.
   Hardin said he had approached McFather and his two predecessors
about absorbing the engineers into his union through what he called
``an honorable affiliation'' that would allow it to exercise
autonomy.
   ``We can't continue with 15 separate unions in an industry that
is merging and reorganizing every day and which has declined from a
million workers to just 300,000,'' Hardin said.
   ``In as much as he (McFather) seems determined to remain a
separate union, we have no alternative but to give the working
engineers, through a representation election, the right to effect a
merger,'' he said.
   Industry negotiators have vowed to reduce the carriers'
unionized labor force by 25 percent, or 60,000 to 75,000 workers,
over the next three years, largely by reducing the size of train
crews who, except for locomotive engineers, mostly belong to the
UTU.
   To accomplish that with as little labor unrest as possible, one
carrier, CSX Rail Transport, the nation's largest, is offering
severance payments of $50,000 to $75,000 for each departing worker.
   And in the first example of so-called ``gain sharing'' with rail
unions, CSX also is offering to split 50-50 with the remaining
workers the $475 million it will save from the job cuts.
   The layoffs would be accomplished by changing the current work
rules between the unions and the railroads, which now require two
brakemen, a conductor and an engineer on every train.
   Most rail labor leaders are hoping that whatever agreement is
struck with CSX will set the pattern for the rest of the industry.
   While other unions are reluctantly yielding to the employment
reductions in exchange for a share of the savings, the UTU has been
the most resistant to the idea, largely because its members would
lose the most jobs.
   ``The UTU is not about to make any agreement with CSX that would
eliminate 9,000 UTU positions out of 10,000 altogether and then
divide the money among all the remaining employees,'' he said. ``We
don't mind dividing the apple, but we want it divided evenly.''
   McFather called Hardin ``a desperate union president motivated
by his own perception that the UTU membership will decline over the
next few years as two- and three-man crews become predominant.''
   ``In many cases, we have been standing side by side with the UTU
and not agreeing with the carriers on the crew issues,'' McFather
said. ``If Mr. Hardin is going to raid our union, we may be more
receptive to negotiating agreements.''
   Ironically, both officials agreed their dispute is only going to
hurt their bargaining position with the railroads.
   Hardin said the railroads are sure to ``capitalize on any
friction and discord among the unions.''
   ``This is not the time to be fighting this kind of war,''
McFather said. ``Anytime the carriers can keep our organizations
pitted against each other, they always come out better off.''

   A measure to build a gambling hall that
initially was approved by two votes lost out in a recount, but
proponents said they would go to court to have a judge review the
ballots.
   A recount Friday gave the proposal a 755-755 time, meaning that
it was defeated, said town clerk Ann Reneke.
   The proposal would have established a card room with as many as
60 tables, a restaurant and cocktail lounge in this financially
strapped river town.
   `It's been a very long, stressful time for all of us,'' Reneke
said.
   Backers of the multimillion-dollar plan said they planned to go
into Solano County Superior Court to ask a judge to review the
ballots.
   ``We will persist,'' said Monte McFall, a proponent of the plan.
``Three of our votes were not counted. If one of those votes is
counted, we will win.''
   The proposal was defeated by voters last November by 30 votes.
In both campaigns, opponents were led by local church leaders.

<TEXT>
   Farmers smashed and burned an American car, torched
boxes of U.S. oranges and set fire to a U.S. flag in a rally
Saturday protesting U.S. demands that Japan end its restrictions on
imported beef and oranges.
   The violence came as U.S. negotiators ended a week of meetings
on trade with no new agreements. A U.S. trade representative
Saturday left for the United States after failing to persuade Japan
to drop import quotas on citrus and beef.
   ``The two sides remain very far apart, said Michael B. Smith,
deputy representative. ``My own opinion is that we moved further
apart,'' he told a news conference at the American Embassy before
his departure.
   About 300 farmers chanted ``Down with U.S. demands'' while a man
jumped onto an American car and smashed its windows with a large
hammer.
   The farmers, wearing head bands saying ``Protect Japanese
agriculture'' in the rain, then piled boxes of U.S. oranges on the
car and set it on fire along with a large American flag.
   Three members of Japan's parliament, including former Vice
Minister of Agriculture Seishiro Eto, attended the rally in the
town of Kokonone in Kyushu in western Japan.
   Scenes of the demonstration were shown on evening television
news broadcasts.
   Kyodo News Service said the farmers destroying the U.S. car were
following the example of U.S. congressmen who smashed a tape
recorder made by Japan's Toshiba Corp. in July last year.
   The congressmen were protesting sales of high-technology milling
machines to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba subsidiary.
   Smith said the two sides differ on three important issues: Japan
wants a transition period before it fully opens its market; it
wants to negotiate the level of foreign access during the
transition; and, after the market is open, Japan wants new or
additional ``border measures'' such as tariffs to protect its
markets.
   Smith said Washington would agree to a transition period as long
as Japan reciprocates by significantly increasing foreign access to
its markets.
   Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Takashi Sato will
leave for Washington this week to continue the talks, he said.
   Japanese newspapers said Saturday the government has decided to
liberalize Japan's beef imports in three years and orange imports
in five years to help defuse trade friction with the United States,
its main ally and trading partner.
   In exchange, Japan would impose a surcharge on American beef and
allow imports to increase by about 15 percent a year, according to
the Mainichi Daily News.
   An increase in surcharges on oranges is prohibited under
international trade rules established by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   But Smith said import surcharges are out of the question. He
declined to say which points the two sides agreed on, saying the
whole package must be negotiated and ``today's numbers are
yesterday's history.''
   The two sides have been negotiating since Tuesday, trying to
reach agreement on a new package after the previous beef and
oranges agreement expired April 1.
   In another set of consultations, Japan asked the United States
to lift the penalty tariffs it imposed on Japanese color
televisions, calculators, computers and power drills over alleged
Japanese violations of an agreement on sales of computer chips, but
the United States refused, saying ``the sanctions will be lifted
once the arrangement is functioning as intended.''
   The two sides also held discussions on structural changes in
Japan's economy and Japanese demands that the United States reduce
its budget deficit and do more to stimulate its own economy.
   The biggest topic of the week turned out to be an item that was
not on the agenda _ a 312-107 vote by the U.S. House of
Representatives approving a comprehensive trade bill that
retaliates against Toshiba Corp.
   The move punishes Toshiba for a subsidiary's sale of sensitive
high technology equipment to the Soviet Union and gives the U.S.
Trade Representative more power in dealing with complaints of
unfair trade practices by foreign countries.
   A U.S. trade official said the timing of the vote was
coincidental and was not designed to send a special message to the
Japanese during the week of talks.
   International Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura
protested the measure and called on President Reagan to veto the
bill.
   ``I suspect that the U.S. House of Representatives was guilty of
racial discrimination and anti-Japanese sentiment in passing the
trade bill,'' Japanese newspapers quoted him as saying.
   Allen Wallis, visiting U.S. undersecretary of state for economic
affairs, said Friday he assured Japan that Reagan would veto the
bill in its present form. The House can override the veto with a
two-thirds' vote.
   Last year Japan bought about $28 billion in U.S. exports, second

exports, making it Japan's biggest trading partner, Wallis said.

<HEAD>Dukakis, in Interview, Sketches Out Foreign Policy and Knocks Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael S. Dukakis, the likely Democratic nominee,
says he considers Republican George Bush ``extremely vulnerable''
in a host of international matters and while a relative novice in
foreign affairs, ``I also have some rather strongly held views.''
   With a rare edge in his voice, Dukakis ran quickly through his
brief against Bush, mentioning arms-for-hostages, support for
former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, a ``failed and illegal
policy in Central America,'' and ``seven precious years doing
virtually nothing'' about the Middle East.
   ``What good is experience if that's what it produces?'' Dukakis
asked, trying out a line for the general election that would bind
Bush to the policies of President Reagan.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Dukakis spoke at
length about his foreign policy views and declared himself eager to
go after Bush on foreign and military affairs.
   ``I think the vice president is extremely vulnerable on foreign
policy. It's going to be an issue. Believe me, I'm going to take
that issue to him and the Republican Party,'' Dukakis said, talking
through a hasty lunch last Thursday in his Statehouse office.
   Dukakis was asked point-blank whether he could imagine himself
unleashing a nuclear warhead.
   ``I don't think it will be necessary,'' he said. ``But if the
policy of nuclear deterrence means what it says, then that has to
be a possibility. Otherwise, nuclear deterrence doesn't mean
anything.''
   In his view, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev recognizes the
Soviet Union is facing grave internal problems, especially in its
sagging economy.
   In the past three years alone, Dukakis said, the Soviet Union
has been buffeted by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and a pending
withdrawal from Afghanistan while at the same time expressing a
willingness to reduce nuclear arms and conventional forces.
   ``All of this is very new, very different. I think principally
because Gorbachev recognizes that they're falling farther and
farther behind in an economic sense. The Soviet economic system is
failing, and they're got to open up that system, or they're going
to become a second- or third-rate economic power,'' Dukakis said.
   While some Americans might welcome a weakened Soviet state,
Dukakis does not.
   ``I think an insecure, failing Soviet Union is not in our
national interest. I'm not saying that a militarily powerful,
adventurous Soviet Union is in our interest. But continued
political instability in the Soviet Union, failure to grapple with
serious problems _ I don't think that's in the best interest of
world peace and world stability,'' he said.
   In a still-hypothetical general election, Bush might be expected
to try to tag Dukakis as a traditional Democratic dove in the cast
of George McGovern. But while Dukakis on Nicaragua may sound like
McGovern on Vietnam, Dukakis talks tough about drawing a line
around North and South America.
   ``Look. We're not going to tolerate a Soviet satellite in this
hemisphere. And it's important to define those terms. ... I'm
talking about a country that is a base for Soviet military power
and is engaging in systematic subversion of its neighbors. We're
not going to tolerate that.''
   In foreign policy terms, Dukakis, as a third-term governor of
Massachusetts, has a political problem and a political opportunity.
He lacks depth of personal experience, especially compared to Bush
_ a former ambassador, CIA director and now vice president.
   The same inexperience was true of Reagan and former President
Carter, both of whom came to the presidency by way of the
statehouse rather than Congress.
   Yet at the same time the Massachusetts governor does not have to
defend a record not of his own making, and he has a relatively
clean slate on which to write his own doctrines. And he doesn't
lack for self-confidence; while he is being urged to select a vice
president with foreign-policy expertise, Dukakis says his secretary
of state will handle those chores.
   In the interview, Dukakis _ who speaks Spanish, Greek and French
but has not traveled extensively _ acknowledged that he has
learning to do.
   ``Of course. You never stop learning in politics,'' he said.
``You work at this all the time. But I also have some rather
strongly held views on the subject of American foreign policy. And
I think if you're going to run for the presidency, you've got a
responsibility to express those views, and to do so with as much
information and knowledge as you can possibly pull together.''
   As for his own views, Dukakis is most emphatic on two points:
ending the shooting in Central America and turning the U.S.-Soviet
relationship into a peaceful blend of rivalry and cooperation.
   ``There's no question that managing that relationship is going
to be probably the single most important foreign policy
responsibility the president has,'' Dukakis said.
   ``The next president of the United States will probably have the
best opportunity in our lifetimes to make real progress in not only
building that relationship but on arms control and arms reduction,
on reducing and eliminating regional conflict, on making the
competition peaceful and not military between the two superpowers.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 Soviet trucks and
armored vehicles lumbered out of the capital at dawn Saturday for
Lowgar province, where Moslem guerrillas have stepped up attacks as
Moscow prepares its troops to withdraw.
   Many ground convoys and transport planes have been leaving Kabul
in recent days to resupply Soviet positions and the vulnerable
Afghan army, according to residents and Western diplomats.
   The Soviets agreed April 14 in Geneva to withdraw their
estimated 115,000 troops from Afghanistan more than eight years
after Moscow intervened to prop up the Marxist government. The
withdrawal is to begin May 15.
   But the agreement is far from a peace accord. Guerrilla
activities, including bombings in Kabul itself, have increased
since February with the approach of spring and the melting of snow
in the northern Hindu Kush and other mountain ranges.
   An alliance of seven Moslem guerrilla groups, whose headquarters
are across the Afghan-Pakistani frontier, rejected the Geneva
accord because it does not guarantee a cutoff of Soviet aid to
President Najib's Afghan government.
   The United States, according to officials in Washington, will
not halt its arms supplies to the guerrillas until the Soviets stop
supplying Najib's troops.
   Meanwhile, the Soviets are are preparing for an escalation of
guerrilla attacks in areas that will be the last to be vacated,
according to foreign analysts.
   Afghanistan's rugged geography has made it a nightmare for
foreign armies since Alexander the Great's short-lived conquest in
the fourth century.
   Soviet watchposts on the road around Kabul show signs of recent
fortification. There is fresh concrete and stonework around Soviet
sentry posts. Bunkers are newly draped with camouflage netting,
Western diplomats said.
   Kabul, hub of Soviet operations, is expected to be one of the
last two cities the Soviets leave before the final withdrawal
deadline of Feb. 15, 1989.
   The other is Mazar-e-Sharif, 40 miles south of the Soviet border
on a dusty plain along the Oxus River.
   During a tightly supervised seven-and-a-half hour visit arranged
by the Afghan government on Friday, several signs of Soviet
presence were visible there. Soviet army fuel trucks were parked
near 20 Afghan air force MIG-21 fighter planes at the airport, a
dozen Soviet soldiers went about their work, and storefronts showed
the Cyrillic lettering used by the Soviets.
   According to Western diplomats and Afghan officials, all
speaking on condition of anonymity, the Soviet pullout will
probably start at their most exposed positions. These include bases
near the Pakistani border.
   Meanwhile, the Soviets have plenty to worry about. According to
a report compiled by Western diplomats, 22 bombs exploded in Kabul
in March, compared with 10 in February. They included magnetic
bombs with timing devices that can be attached to vehicles, one
diplomat said.
   Other guerrilla activities in recent weeks included curtailing
movement on roads linking Kabul with other major cities, according
to the diplomat and residents.
   The diplomat said the guerrillas cut the road to Ghazni, 75
miles southwest of Kabul, on April 14. A reporter who flew over the
road a week later saw only a dozen vehicles on a normally
well-traveled section of the road.
   Lowgar province, which abuts the Kabul-Ghazni road, is ``very
insecure,'' one Western source said.
   Indeed, the Soviet convoy that headed there Saturday showed
signs of apprehension.
   It included eight T-62 tanks, at least a dozen armored personnel
carriers, a score or more of trucks loaded with coal, and about 10
trucks carrying communications gear.
   Many trucks had metal plates that covered the lower half of the
windshield on the driver's side and left only a brick-sized opening
on the passenger's side.
   The drivers, many of whom appeared to be teen-agers, wore
helmets and flak jackets.
   Some trucks were mounted with anti-aircraft guns. The guerrillas
do not have aircraft, so the guns would presumably be used to
attack their mountain positions.

<HEAD>Eight Islanders Rescued In Pacific After Drifting 29 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight Kiribati islanders adrift in a canoe for
29 days were rescued by an American tuna boat in the western
Pacific, but the survivors said a woman and child died during the
ordeal, according to a fishing industry official.
   Friday's rescue occurred some 1,100 miles from Kiribati, an
island nation once known as the Gilbert Islands, said August
Felando, president of the San Diego-based American Tuna Boat
Association.
   Louis Machado, master of the J.M. Martinac, reported the rescue
of the three women and five men, Felando said. The survivors were
taken abord the fishing boat and were headed for Ponape, part of
the Federated States of Micronesia.
   They told Machado that a 2-year-old child and 27-year-old woman
had died while they were adrift, said Felando.
   Those aboard the motorized canoe survived on rainwater and fresh
fish after the engine failed during a trip from one island in the
Kiribati chain to another, he said. The bodies of the dead woman
and child were thrown overboard, he said.

<HEAD>Welfare Overhaul Reflects Changed Society</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overwhelming dissatisfaction with the welfare
system is pushing Congress toward major revisions in a program that
started 53 years ago, before working women, teen-age mothers and
child poverty were commonplace.
   The overhaul bills passed last year by the House and last week
by the Senate Finance Committee acknowledge, as the Senate bill
puts it, ``the vastly changed family arrangements of the
intervening half century'' since the start of the Aid to Families
with Dependent Children program.
   Both bills stress family responsibility and community obligation
_ parental responsibility to support children and the community's
obligation to make that feasible through expanded education and
training opportunities. And, to varying degrees, both bills would
improve benefits for families who absolutely must rely on
government assistance.
   Preliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office put the
five-year cost of the House bill at $7.1 billion and the Senate
bill at $2.8 billion. Whatever emerges from Congress will be more
extensive than the $913 million plan backed by the Reagan
administration, and is likely to draw a veto.
   Nevertheless, liberals and conservatives remain convinced that
the system must be changed and many of them are in agreement on how
to do it. The Senate bill is co-sponsored by a majority of the
Senate. And while the House bill was passed without GOP backing,
some Republicans indicated they could accept the Senate approach.
   Following is a comparison of major provisions in the two bills.
The Senate bill may be amended on the floor, and the final product
likely will combine features of the Senate and House bills.

<HEAD>CASH BENEFITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Senate: Changes AFDC to the Child Support Supplement Program.
Requires all states to provide assistance to two-parent families in
which the principal wage-earner is unemployed (currently an option
picked up by half the states), but benefits may be limited to six
months. No change in the amount of earnings or child care costs
that states must disregard in determining who gets benefits.
   House: Changes AFDC to the Family Support Program. Requires all
states to provide assistance to two-parent families in which the
principal wage-earner is unemployed. The National Academy of
Sciences must recommend a national minimum benefit level within two
years. States would receive a 25 percent increase in their federal
matching share for any benefit increases between Oct. 1, 1988 and
Oct. 1, 1991.

<HEAD>WORK</HEAD>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Basic Program</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate: States would replace the existing, small-scale Work
Incentive program (WIN) with a comprehensive Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills (JOBS) program. JOBS must include basic education and
skills training plus other activities chosen by the states.
   House: States would replace WIN with a National Education,
Training and Work (NETWork) program. The program must offer high
school, remedial education, bilingual education and other specific
activities. Community work experience, also known as workfare, must
teach marketable skills and last no longer than six months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Who Must Participate</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate: Able-bodied adults, including parents of children over
age 3 or, at state option, age 1. If the child is under 6, required
participation is limited to 24 hours a week. States must guarantee
that child care is available. The federal government helps pay for
child care and transportation.
   House: Able-bodied adults, including parents of children over
age 3 or, at state option, age 1. If the child is under 6, required
participation is limited to 20 hours a week. States with the lower
age requirement must demonstrate that infant care is available for
$200 a month or less. The federal government helps pay for child
care and transportation costs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Wages</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate: People do not have to accept a job if it pays less than
their cash benefits combined with food stamps and Medicaid, unless
the state makes up the difference with a supplemental benefit.
   House: Wages must be at least equal to whatever is highest _ the
federal minimum wage, the state minimum wage or the pay rate for
people in similar positions with the same employer. People do not
have to accept jobs if the result is a net loss of income,
including the insurance value of Medicaid.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Financing</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate: Federal government pays for 90 percent of the JOBS
program up to the amount the states received last year under WIN.
After that the federal contribution would range from 60 to 80
percent, except that administrative costs are split 50-50. Federal
outlays are capped at $3 billion over five years; states are only
expected to seek about one-third of that amount as they gear up
their programs.
   House: Similar, except no cap on federal spending.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Work Transition</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Senate: States must provide child care for nine months to
families that lose cash benefits due to earnings. Families must
contribute to the cost. States must continue Medicaid for six
months for such families, and may offer Medicaid for another six
months to those with incomes below 185 percent of the federal
poverty standard. Those above poverty level _ $11,650 for a family
of four _ would be a charged a premium.
   House: States must provide child care for at least a year to
families losing benefits due to earnings, unless family income in
prior quarter was more than 150 percent of the poverty level.
Families must contribute on a sliding fee scale. No Medicaid
provision.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILD SUPPORT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Senate: Federal government would pay 90 percent of cost of lab
tests used to establish paternity. Immediate wage-withholding
required for all new or modified support orders enforced by state
child support agency and for earlier orders if the agency requests.
   House: Immediate wage-withholding required for all orders issued
or modified in the state and being enforced by the state.

<HEAD>Hijackers Believed With Hezbollah In Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab hijackers who held a Kuwait
Airways jet for 16 days and killed two of its passengers have been
traced to the stronghold of pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon,
diplomatic sources said Saturday.
   Arab and Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the hijackers were believed to have made their getaway in an
Algerian air force plane via the Syrian capital of Damascus before
dawn Wednesday.
   The sources said the leader of the hijackers was believed to be
Izzedine Hassan, a Shiite hardliner known to have been involved in
the 1985 TWA hijacking in which an American was killed.
   ``Various diplomatic security and counter-terrorist agencies are
trying to keep track of the gang,'' one diplomat said. ``The men
are believed to have gone underground with Hezbollah in a largely
Shiite part of west Beirut where their trail is easily lost.''
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a pro-Iranian Shiite radical
movement that holds Western hostages in Lebanon. Terry Anderson,
the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, is
among their captives.
   On Saturday, the hijacked Boeing 747 was still being examined at
Algiers airport by Algerian security men and aviation specialists.
A Kuwaiti crew was standing by to fly it home as soon as the
Algerians give the go-ahead.
   The United States, Britain and other Western governments have
paid tribute to the Algerians for negotiating the release of the
last 31 hostages without further violence. But they have criticized
Algeria for allowing the hijackers to escape unpunished.
   Flight 422, carrying 112 passengers, was hijacked April 5 on a
flight from Bangkok, Thailand, to Kuwait. It landed first in
Mashhad, Iran, where 57 passengers were released. Then it went to
Larnaca, Cyprus, where 13 captives were freed and two others were
killed. The plane flew to Algiers and upon touching down one
hostage was released for medical reasons.
   On Wednesday, after lengthy negotiations with Algerian
authorities, the remaining hostages were freed.
   Algeria's state-run media rejected criticism as ``arrogant and
hypocritical interference'' in the nation's internal affairs, and
asked why the West did not display similar concern over ``state
terrorism'' carried out by Israel and South Africa.
   The sources said Algerian negotiators worked out a meticulous
and elaborate deal with the hijackers during the six days the plane
was held at Algiers' Houari Boumedienne airport.
   One diplomat, who received a continuous Algerian progress report
while the negotiations were going on, said the secret talks were
concerned more with assuring the hijackers' unimpeded getaway than
with the fate of the hostages.
   ``While the plane was still on the ground in Cyprus, the
Algerians received a promise that the hostages would not be harmed
on Algerian soil,'' the source said.
   ``The Algerian negotiators thereupon allowed the plane to take
off for Algiers and then took the hijackers at their word. Events
proved them right.''
   Whether the Algerians were right to observe their part of the
bargain and help the hijackers escape after the hostages were freed
``is essentially a philosophical question over the validity of
bargaining under duress,'' another diplomat said.
   ``While we are appreciative of the Algerian efforts to avoid
further bloodshed, we do not see eye-to-eye with them on this other
aspect of the problem.''
   Algeria has repeatedly played the role of ``honest broker'' in
negotiating the release of hijack and kidnap victims, including the
American hostages from the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1981 and the
TWA passengers in 1985.
   Algerian officials said Algeria would forfeit its ability to
play such a role in the future if it was seen to doublecross one of
the parties to a compromise.
   The diplomats said they believed the hijackers may have been
taken to Damascus on Wednesday in a special plane carrying a
high-ranking Algerian official, Mohamed Cherif Messadia, to the
Syrian capital for talks with President Hafez Assad.
   Messadia is generally regarded as the number two man in the
Algerian government after President Chadli Bendjedid. His presence
may have given the hijackers some assurance their aircraft would
not be intercepted enroute.

<HEAD>Irony In Legal Battle For Entertainer's Millions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1963, Liberace was hospitalized in
Pittsburgh with a near-fatal illness and his doctors told him to
put his affairs in order. He did, giving away most of his
possessions and spending thousands of dollars on gifts for friends.
   After weeks in intensive care, the flashy entertainer recovered
and found himself rebuilding his life, physically and financially.
   Never again, he vowed, would he give away his wealth at the whim
of someone or something out of his control.
   But now, a year after his death, Liberace's millions are the
subject of controversy again. And a bitter court battle he would
have detested is being waged to determine who will head the
foundation he set up to help aspiring young artists.
   Liberace's sister, Angie, his manager of 36 years and three
other associates have filed suit against Los Angeles attorney Joel
Strote, charging he got Liberace to sign a new will 13 days before
he died at his Palm Springs, Calif., home. The will named Strote as
executor of the estate and head of a trust to funnel money to the
Liberace Foundation for the Performing Arts.
   The 100 pages of death-bed documents gave Strote full control of
an estate valued at $20 million.
   Strote said Liberace called him to his Malibu, Calif., home
three weeks before he died on Feb. 5, 1987, asking that the will be
drawn and that longtime manager Seymour Heller be removed from any
position of control.
   The suit contends Strote took advantage of Liberace, who was
dying of an illness brought on by complications from AIDS. It asks
that Strote be removed as executor and head of the trust.
   The case has gone to trial, and Strote spent several hours on
the witness stand in state district court last week, with a return
scheduled Monday. He testified that his actions have been in the
best interests of Liberace's estate and foundation, and that his
activities as a lawyer and executor of the estate are dictated by
law.
   He declined Thursday to comment on the legal battle.
   During a break in the trial, Heller bemoaned Strote's actions
since taking over as executor. He said Strote had taken priceless
heirlooms that belonged in a Liberace museum and sold them at
auction in Los Angeles earlier this month. The auction netted an
estimated $2 million for the foundation.
   ``He even sold the man's driver's license,'' Heller said
disgustedly. ``Can you imagine that? He sold some of the gifts my
wife and I gave to Lee. They had our names engraved on them.''
   The other plaintiffs are Dorothy McMahon, housekeeper at
Liberace's Palm Springs home; Gladys Luckie, housekeeper in Las
Vegas, and Cary James, a longtime companion of Liberace.
   The attorney for the five plaintiffs, Harold Gewerter, charged
in opening statements that Strote had talked to Liberace about a
new will Jan. 15, 1987, then had 100 pages of legal documents drawn
up and returned a week later for Liberace's signature.
   ``Liberace was in such a mental state on the 22nd that he
couldn't understand or read independently,'' Gewerter said. ``If
Pee Wee Herman had walked into his room and said he wanted to be
executor, he (Liberace) would have said `yes.' He (Strote) goes
into that room owning nothing and comes out with a bag of goodies.''
   Gewerter charged that Strote had taken hundreds of thousands of
dollars from the estate.
   Liberace's determination to control who would benefit from his
estate stemmed from his hospitalization in Pittsburgh on Nov. 22,
1963, when he suffered uremic poisoning after inhaling carbon
tectrachloride fumes from a fluid he was using to clean a costume.
   He was hospitalized in intensive care for weeks.
   ``The doctors told me to `put my house in order,''' he recalled
in later interviews. ``It's a funny way to tell a man to get ready
to die.''
   He was given last rites and told he had about $750,000 in the
bank after taking care of charities and individuals he had included
in his will.
   He then went on a deathbed buying binge: a Beverly Hills home
for his sister, furs and jewelry for his mother, a boat for one of
his 28 staff members, cars, motorcycles, etc.
   ``If you think a drunken sailor spends money carelessly, you
should get a load of a rich piano player when he thinks he's
dying,'' Liberace wrote.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebels Shell Ethiopia's Biggest Port, Only Refinery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABEBE ANDUALEM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean rebels shelled Ethiopia's
biggest port and its only oil refinery, diplomats and the official
news agency said. Five people were reported killed and 15 wounded.
   In an unprecedented report on the civil war in the north, the
Ethiopian News Agency reported Friday that the rebels launched
attack on the port of Assab at midnight Tuesday from a boat at
nearby Senabor Island.
   ``Bandits who are bent on creating havoc to lives and property
fired shells at the town,'' the news agency reported.
   ``A team from the Ethiopian navy immediately took action and
blew up the boat in which the rebels had infiltrated the area. The
boat was reported to have capsized with the rebels in it,'' said
the agency.
   Western diplomats said it was believed to be the first rebel
attack on the port 530 miles northeast of Addis Ababa, the capital
of the Marxist government. Assab and Massawa, Ethiopia's only other
port of significance, are both in Eritrea, where the secessionist
Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting for 27 years
in Africa's oldest civil war. The rebels also are Marxist.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
believed Assab refinery was not damaged but were unsure about the
port, which controls up to 80 percent of this East African nation's
imports and exports, including emergency food for 7 million drought
victims.
   The official news agency did not say whether the port or
refinery were damaged. It also did not report how many rebels were
involved in the attack, nor did it indicate what type of weapons
they used.
   The agency also disclosed for the first time that rebels of the
Tigrean People's Liberation Front recently destroyed one of the
microwave relay stations connecting the Eritrean capital, Asmara,
to the rest of the country.
   Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago, demanding a bigger say
in governing their province.
   The news agency made no reference to a claim by the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front that it shot down a MiG-21 fighter jet
Friday and captured the pilot, identified as Capt. Tilahun Begarso.
   Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea, the clandestine rebel
radio, said the plane was hit during ongoing fighting northeast of
Asmara. It claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and 216
wounded in a battle there Thursday.
   The Assab attack report is the first of its kind since President
Mengistu Haile Mariam ended years of official silence March 30
about insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring provinces of
Eritrea and Tigre.
   In his first admission that his government is at war, Mengistu
announced an imminent offensive against the rebels, who have
captured several towns in major victories this year.
   No foreign relief agencies have been based in Assab since the
government on April 6 expelled about 60 Western relief workers from
the war-torn provinces, citing ``personnel risks.''
   The expulsions have jeopardized a massive Western-funded
emergency relief operation to help an estimated 3.2 million people
threatened with starvation in Eritrea and Tigre, the provinces
worst hit by drought.
   This week, following a visit by a U.N. troubleshooter, the
government allowed back into Asmara four U.N. workers who supervise
trucking and a big airlift of relief food forced by the war.
   Chester Crocker, assistant U.S. secretary of state, charged in
Washington on Saturday that Mengistu banned the foreigners to
remove witnesses as the government prepares for all-out war.
   ``He doesn't want anyone to see what's going on up there because
it's going to be bloody,'' Crocker told the African and Human
Rights subcommittees of the House of Representatives' Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   Western diplomats and relief officials have expressed similar
fears.
   They have accused the government and rebels of jeopardizing the
lives of drought victims in pursuit of military victory.
   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies when, with a clique of
military officers, he helped overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie in
1974.

<HEAD>Rights Group Says Panama Guilty of Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

   Panama's military-dominated government has
engaged in a widespread pattern of human rights abuses, including
the beating and jailing of protestors and mistreatment of
prisoners, according to a report by a human rights group released
Saturday.
   The report, prepared by Americas Watch, a private, New
York-based group, said Panamanian authorities have mixed political
prisoners with violent criminals in substandard conditions, engaged
in vandalism and silenced opposition news media.
   Discussing anti-government demonstrations, the report said,
``hundreds of people appear to have been arrested solely for the
non-violent expression of their political beliefs.''
   The study said the abuses have been particularly severe since
Panama's political crisis erupted last June. It described the
Reagan administration's policy toward the alleged repression in
Panama as ``uneven and often contradictory.''
   The report was written by Jose Zalaquett, a consultant to
Americas Watch, after a mission to Panama last September. But some
of the alleged abuses described in the report occurred in recent
weeks.
   Last Wednesday, the Panamanian government lifted a ``state of
urgency'' that was imposed after an abortive coup attempt a month
ago.
   The crackdown permitted the government to suspend a wide range
of civil liberties, including freedom of speech and assembly and
the right to private property.
   While the report said that some of the more flagrant abuses
could be eliminated by the departure of Panama's military chief,
Manuel Antonio Noriega, others will be eliminated only through the
decisive action of a new government.
   Such a government, among other steps, should guarantee that
future elections are free and fair and take steps to ensure that
the military does not interfere with the political process, the
report said.
   It added that American policy toward Panama ``seems to have been
dictated by constantly changing calculations about what best
ensures stability in Panama.''
   For years, the report said, ``the Reagan administration chose
not to criticize the regimes controlled by Noriega, even as the
general consolidated his power and corruption reached new depths.''
Noriega, who has headed Panama's Defense Forces since 1983, is
under federal indictment on drug smuggling charges.
   The report said that even though the State Department knew the
1984 presidential elections in Panama were rigged by the military,
Secretary of State George P. Shultz gave his blessing to the
process by attending the inauguration of the new president.
   Shultz has denied that any such information was available at the
time of the election.
   The report said the administration, in Panama and other
countries, pursued an inconsistent human rights policy.
   ``Concern for human rights violations and for a lack of
democratic practices is too often voiced at the 11th hour when the
administration faces a volatile situation with potential national
security implications,'' it said.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Health Care Plan Could Be `Godsend'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUNCAN MANSFIELD</BYLINE>

   Bill McFarland believes his rising medical claims
for a diabetic condition cost him his job, along with his company
health insurance, but today he has hope in a new state law that he
thinks will ``save myself and my family from potential financial
ruin.''
   Massachusetts' universal health care act was signed into law
last week by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, a Democratic presidential
contender who has touted it as an example for the rest of the
country. The first-in-the-nation measure promises to make
affordable health insurance available to all residents, rich or
poor, working or unemployed, by 1992.
   McFarland, 53, knows something about health insurance. The job
he lost was as a chief fraud investigator for a major Massachusetts
insurance company, his employer of 13 years.
   While other factors may have been involved in his termination,
McFarland is convinced that the claims he filed for six $1,000
diabetes-related eye operations played a major role.
   And since he began working as a self-employed financial
consultant, McFarland has found himself ``effectively in a Catch-22
situation'' in trying to get health insurance because his diabetes
is considered a non-coverable, pre-existing condition.
   ``My efforts have indicated to me I couldn't even get (a policy)
that would cover diabetes, irrespective of the dollars of premium I
were able to pay,'' he said. ``In other words, I can get coverage
except for the coverage that I need.''
   Enter the Massachusetts universal health care plan, under which
by 1992, or possibly sooner, the state will broker pooled insurance
for small businesses and individuals which participants can buy
into on a sliding fee schedule based on their income.
   The details of what these plans will offer will be decided later
by the new state agency that will manage the system. But Catherine
Dunham, Dukakis' health policy adviser, said pre-existing
conditions will definitely be covered.
   ``This is really landmark legislation,'' McFarland said. ``It's
recognizing, in my judgment, that health care is a right, rather
than a privilege.''
   Dukakis says the four-year phase-in will cost the state $645.2
million, minus about $22.5 million in projected Medicaid
cost-cutting. But some estimates have run as high as $1.2 billion.
   The law would extend coverage to about 600,000 Massachusetts
residents under age 65 currently without health insurance, or
roughly one of every 10 people in the commonwealth.
   This would be done in stages and through a variety of
approaches, from extending Medicaid benefits for disabled adults
and children to state- brokered, pooled insurance for small
businesses and individuals.
   By 1992, all employers with more than five full-time employees
must offer health insurance coverage or pay an unemployment
surcharge to help the state provide this coverage to the uninsured.
   Jeannette Capone, 52, lives in Athol with her healthy
14-year-old daughter and her 68-year-old husband, who has chronic
emphysema and hasn't been able to work for a dozen years.
   When her family was younger and she had five children living at
home, Capone briefly went on welfare. But she hated the
condescension she felt from neighbors and welfare workers so she
found work in part-time jobs that would allow her to continue
caring for her homebound husband.
   Today, Capone does light cleaning for a company that recently
began offering health insurance to full-time employees. But Capone
isn't covered because she only works about 20 hours a week.
   Capone gets free indigent medical care for herself and her
daughter through her local hospital's emergency room.
   Her husband's major medical expenses are covered by Medicare,
but she still has to pay for the seven medications he has to take,
costing $40 to $45 a week.
   ``What breaks me up is that I can apply for welfare, I can apply
for Medicaid'' and all her medical expenses will be paid, she said.
But to be eligible, she would have to quit her job.
   ``I want to work, I want to help and do things on my own,'' she
said.
   The state this year will allow disabled adults like her husband
to buy into the Medicaid program according to their ability to pay.
   And in 1992, most employers will be required to offer health
insurance to employees working at least 20 hours per week.

<NOTE>EDs: TOPS with 6 grafs to update with Reagan radio address; picks

   President Reagan warned today that continuing
Iranian terrorist and military attacks against neutral parties
``will be very costly to Iran and its people.''
   Reagan added comments on Iran to his weekly radio speech, which
dealt mostly with trade policy, as officials disclosed that his
administration will expand the U.S. role in the Persian Gulf by
allowing American warships to aid neutral merchant ships under
attack.
   ``We are very pleased with the role that the European allies are
playing in a cooperative effort to counter the Iranian mining
threat and to help protect freedom of navigation,'' the president
said in his speech from Camp David.
   ``Such cooperative efforts, supported by our Gulf Arab friends,
offer the best means of deterring Iran and enhancing gulf
security,'' Reagan said.
   ``Working together,'' he said, ``we can put new life into UN
Security Council efforts to end the increasingly bloody, inhumane
Iran-Iraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf.''
   ``Our role in this war is neutral and we do not seek to confront
Iran,'' the president said. ``However, its leaders must understand
that continued military and terrorist attacks against
nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate an end to the war will be
very costly to Iran and its people.''
   The plan for a more active role in the gulf is a direct result
of the mining of a U.S. frigate and Monday's extensive fighting
between Iranian and U.S. forces, administration officials said
Friday.
   The administration is seeking support from congressional leaders
and allied governments for the new policy, under which Navy
warships would no longer ignore Iranian attacks on merchant ships
that weren't flying the American flag.
   If a U.S. warship observed an Iranian attack and was close
enough to intervene, it would have the authority to do so, said the
officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified.
   ``It's a random, target-of-opportunity approach designed to
throw the Iranians off guard,'' said one source.
   The U.S. has since last summer guarded American-flagged Kuwaiti
tankers, which had come under special fire from Iran in the gulf.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, confirmed the new policy had been discussed Friday with
congressional leaders. He said the policy would ``enable U.S. Navy
vessels to defend themselves fully and to take appropriate action
to deal with specific circumstances.''
   Although Aspin refused to discuss specifics, another Capitol
Hill source who was briefed on the matter said, ``This will give a
lot of authority to local commanders and a lot of leeway to do as
they see fit.''
   The new policy assumes Iraq, at war with Iran for 7{ years, will
not attack neutral merchant ships operating between neutral ports.
It thus is intended to apply specifically in cases of neutral
merchant ships under Iranian attack.
   ``Our purpose is not to get into a war with Iran,'' said an
official. ``Our purpose is to secure safe passage for neutral
shipping moving back and forth between neutral ports.''
   The sources stressed the policy change did not entail an
extension of the U.S. military umbrella to foreign-flag ships in
regular convoys. Even under the new policy, only ships flying the
American flag will be entitled to ``door-to-door protection'' in
convoys.
   Also rejected in formulating the new policy were suggestions
that Navy warships start protecting American-owned ships that fly a
foreign flag of convenience, the sources said.
   Because of those decisions, the Pentagon hopes it can avoid the
assignment of additional ships to the gulf to implement the new
policy, the officials said.
   The new policy will extend in certain cases, however, to
Western-operated oil rigs in the gulf, the sources said.
   The officials, citing the need ``to keep Iran guessing,''
refused to say when the administration intended to implement the
new policy. One source said it could happen ``soon, maybe next
week,'' but refused to elaborate.
   Another official suggested the timing could still be affected by
on-going consultations with congressional leaders and with U.S.
allies such as Britain and France that have their own warships in
the region.
   Aspin said specifics about the policy are classified.
   ``There is a decision in the sense that we know where we want to
go now,'' said one official. ``But we're still consulting with some
people and it's not in our interest to offer details to Iran.''
   The change, which Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci and top
aides began outlining on Capitol Hill on Friday, is a result of the
mining of the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts April 14 and last
Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and U.S. forces, the
officials said.
   U.S. forces sank or crippled six Iranian vessels that challenged
them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for
the mining of the Roberts.
   Top defense officials argued to the White House the United
States had to do more to deter Iran from sowing additional mine
fields in the gulf, said the sources. The Pentagon further argued
that Iran's response to the U.S. strike on Monday ``was so utterly
intemperate, just lashing out,'' that something had to be done, one
official said.
   At one point Monday, Iranian gunboats began firing on oil rigs
and Western ships in an oil field that had not been the scene of
earlier fighting.
   According to the sources, the upcoming changes will not affect
the so-called ``rules of engagement'' _ the guidelines given Navy
commanders spelling out the conditions under which they may shoot;
for example, the need for radio challenges and the range between
forces.

<DATELINE>GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George is a gander in love, but the
object of his affection is indifferent to his attentions and might
not even notice if she stepped on him.
   George, a Canada goose, is hung up on a black cow named Gracie
in an odd- couple courtship rivaling that of Jessica the cow and
her moose.
   Farmer Al Jones first noticed the peculiar relationship during
the goose mating season last year.
   ``There at the first last spring, I just figured old George had
been out in the spring sun too long. I couldn't help but notice how
he would follow the cow everywhere she went,'' Jones said. ``He
even started sleeping with her.''
   Jones said he was the only one who noticed and didn't tell
anyone else.
   George eventually came to his senses, but when he started up
again earlier this spring Jones told his wife and daughter about
the bird's bizarre love life.
   They thought it was a joke, but Jones told them to look for
themselves.
   ``He just follows her around like that's his mate,'' said Jones'
daughter, Sarah, 20.
   George wants nothing to do with the rest of the large flock of
geese on the farm and doesn't show an interest in any other cow but
Gracie, Jones said.
   ``And I would notice how old George would try to flirt and carry
on with Gracie,'' he said. ``Why he would get right up in her face
and make the strangest rackets you've ever heard, like he was
trying to get the cow to come fly away with him.''
   Ms. Jones said she doesn't think George would try to hurt anyone
who interfered, although the bird did charge a newspaper reporter
who tried to get close enough to snap a photograph.
   ``When it started over this spring, he seemed bolder and more
romantic than last year,'' Jones said.
   George has been a member of the flock at Jones' farm for about
five years, Ms. Jones said. She thinks he was hatched there, but
it's hard to tell because the flock is large and gets mixed up with
migrating geese making pit stops.
   Gracie, meanwhile, doesn't take an active part in the
relationship.
   ``George calls all the shots and does all the flirting,'' Jones
said. ``Gracie just goes along to see what will happen next.''
   Gracie's attitude mirrors that of Jessica, a Hereford cow in
Shrewsbury, Vt., who was courted for 76 days from in the fall and
winter of 1986-87 by a lovesick bull moose.

<HEAD>Restoration of Tropical Forests Could Slow Down `Greenhouse
Effect'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major efforts to restore tropical forests
could bring an important slowdown in the expected ``greenhouse
effect'' warming of the earth, according to a study of forest needs.
   Growing trees absorb carbon dioxide, the principal gas
responsible for the warming, and break the gas down to incorporate
carbon in their woody tissues. A growing forest also adds carbon to
the soil.
   ``It does provide an important lag time ... while we do
important things in other areas, like re-orient national energy
policies,'' said Lori Heise, a researcher at the Worldwatch
Institute and one of the authors of the study released Saturday.
   The institute is a Washington-based environmental research
organization. It has frequently advocated increased conservation
and use of renewable resources to replace fossil fuels.
   Carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere in the burning of
all fossil fuels. It warms the earth by trapping heat that normally
would be radiated out to space.
   Most scientists believe the earth is warming, with potentially
large changes in rainfall patterns, energy demand, crop-growing
areas and a rising sea level to threaten low-lying areas.
   About 40 percent of the earth's land area, or 12.8 billion
acres, is covered with forest, of which about 7.3 billion acres was
tropical forest in 1980. The Worldwatch study estimates that about
3.2 million acres, an area the size of Connecticut or Northern
Ireland, is lost every year.
   In their study of current tropical forest issues, Heise and
co-author Sandra Postel, estimated that tropical countries need to
restore about 250 million acres of forest to repair damage to soils
and streams, 140 million acres to supply fuelwood and 25 million
acres for timbering.
   Counting overlap and wood used for fuel in the near term, they
estimated that about 300 million acres of new tropical forest could
extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while the trees mature,
which could be 30 or 40 years from planting.
   This would cover an area a bit smaller than Arizona, California,
Nevada and Oregon.
   In an admitted ``back-of-the-envelope'' calculation, Postel and
Heise estimated that the growing trees could remove 860 million
tons of carbon from the atmosphere each year until the trees
matured. This would be about 47 percent of the total carbon
currently being released by forest destruction.
   Irving Mintzer, a researcher for the World Resources Institute
who has studied the greenhouse effect, said the estimates of his
counterpart organization ``are not trivial,'' amounting to about 15
percent of carbon released by all fossil fuel combustion. ``But we
should not be seduced into thinking (reforestation) can solve the
warming problem,'' he said.
   Slowing the destruction of tropical forests has the additional
benefit of reducing emissions of methane, another greenhouse gas,
Mintzer said.
   The World Bank, the World Resources Institute and United Nations
agencies launched an effort in late 1985 to invest $8 billion,
counting government and private investments, in reforestation over
the next five years.
   The Worldwatch study said the success of the effort would depend
on efforts individual countries make, and those in turn would
depend on mobilizing international private organizations and
foundations and local private groups.
   ``Indeed, what is needed in the coming decade is an effort
somewhat akin to the agricultural Green Revolution of the sixties:
a dedication to developing genetically improved tree species and to
extending widely the technical and financial resources for
reforestation,'' said the Worldwatch paper.
   To plant the forests they call for by the year 2000 would mean
planting 17 billion trees per year, a massive undertaking, the
researchers said.

   Michael G. French no longer faces a
first-degree rape charge, but the founder of a support program for
spouse abusers says he still faces the trial of restoring his
reputation.
   ``There always will be people out there scratching their heads,
saying, `He got off only because there was not enough proof,'''
French said after the Grand Traverse County Prosecutor's Office
dropped the charge last week. ``The accusation itself will remain a
stain as long as I'm around.''
   French, 43, was arrested in November 1986 and charged with
first-degree criminal sexual conduct after allegedly assaulting a
39-year-old Traverse City woman the previous month.
   Assistant Prosecutor Arnie White said he dropped the charge
because the woman refused to cooperate with prosecutors. She
refused to comply with a court order requesting medical and
psychological records, told her attorney she would not testify and
finally indicated she wanted to ``drop the whole thing,'' White
said.
   Richard Zerafa, the woman's attorney, said she was not opposed
to dropping the charge but said she wasn't willing to disclose
personal information.
   French said the accusation not only cost him thousands of
dollars in lawyers' fees but also cost him an estimated $50,000 in
revenue for the Time Out support program he started in September
1985, two years after he pleaded guilty to assaulting an
ex-girlfriend.
   Referrals from local courts and community groups stopped after
he was charged, French said.
   ``It's been pretty scary ... I was laboring under the
misconception that a man was innocent until proven guilty, and I
found in a lot of ways it isn't true,'' he said.

   Tons of fish along a 20-mile stretch of river
died when a pipe at a sewage treatment lagoon ruptured, sending an
estimated 400,000 gallons of toxic wastes cascading into the South
Branch Kishwaukee River.
   Jack Adam, environmental protection specialist with the Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency in Rockford, said the fish kill had
spread 20 miles from its source and nearly reached the Rock River.
   ``It's a pretty extensive fish kill, one of the worst we've seen
in many years,'' Adam said. ``It's a 100 percent kill for the first
10 miles of the river. I imagine there's hundreds of tons of dead
fish.''
   Adam said the kill occurred Wednesday night when employees at a
hog farm were installing new pipe in a dike on a sewage treatment
lagoon about two miles southwest of Genoa in northern Illinois.
   ``It's just got away from them,'' he said.
   No drinking water was threatened, Adam said.

acknowledged Saturday he had many differences in his talks with
General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but he tried to minimize
the disagreements.
   Gorbachev, speaking with Shultz, had made a scathing attack on
the ``sermons'' he said President Reagan and other U.S. officials
had delivered about Soviet behavior.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch distributed Friday
after Shultz ended two days of talks in Moscow, quoted Gorbachev as
telling Shultz that U.S.-Soviet relations ``are in need of a
drastic restructuring.''
   Gorbachev complained that ``everything that has been achieved in
Soviet-American relations is being ascribed to the policy of
strength and putting pressure on the Soviets.''
   He accused U.S. officials of constantly barraging their Soviet
counterparts with ``demands, terms and grievances'' about human
rights in the Soviet Union. ``We are not going to re-educate the
United States and do not recognize it has any right to re-educate
us,'' Gorbachev told Shultz.
   The Soviet leader was most distressed with a speech in
Springfield, Mass., on Thursday in which Reagan complained about
Soviet aggression worldwide. Reagan said that until it ended, ``the
world cannot know true peace.''
   Shultz, on a sightseeing tour of Kiev, the capital of the
Ukraine, said the superpowers have had ``lots of difficulties as
well as lots of accomplishments.''
   ``There have been some very tough parts to every meeting on both
sides,'' Shultz said. ``He has things to say. I have things to say,
and there are always some informative parts and there are positive
parts.''
   Later, flying from Kiev to Tbilisi, the capital of the Soviet
republic of Georgia, Shultz and other U.S. officials sought again
to convince reporters that Gorbachev's statement did not represent
new strains with the United States.
   As if to underscore that the dialogue will continue, Charles E.
Redman, the State Department spokesman, announced that Shultz would
meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Geneva
May 11-12 to continue preparations for Reagan's summit with
Gorbachev in Moscow May 29-June 2.
   Shultz called the Tass account and stories based on it
``overblown,'' and he defended Reagan's tough rhetoric.
   ``I think perhaps there is an overreaction to the Springfield
speech,'' Shultz said.
   ``The president has always taken the view, that I agree with,
that we have to state our views realistically all the time. And we
have to act in terms of the things we think need to be done.''
   Shultz said he would keep stressing a need to improve human
rights conditions in the Soviet Union.
   Little progress was reported on the focus of Shultz's talks in
Moscow, negotiating a treaty to cut in half the superpowers'
arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons.
   Shultz visited Kiev and Tbilisi for sightseeing before heading
Sunday for Brussels to brief the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
on his Moscow talks.
   In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, he visited the site of a World
War II German atrocity.
   ``We have to say to ourselves always, never again,'' Shultz
declared in tribute to the 30,000 Jews and 70,000 other Ukrainians
the German invaders herded into a ravine at Babi Yar and
machine-gunned in September 1941.
   Stressing the heavy Jewish toll, Shultz said, ``This was among
the first places where we saw the holocaust and the slaughter of
Jews.''
   His visit fell on the Jewish Sabbath. Shultz laid a wreath at a
monument the Soviets erected in 1976 and observed a minute of
silence.
   The American envoy also visited an unfinished U.S. consulate in
Kiev, the third largest city in the Soviet Union. Construction of
the mission has been halted and no date has been set for completion.
   American officials cite security concerns, a tighter budget and
congressional opposition. But Shultz favors opening the consulate
for the wider knowledge it would bring of the Soviet Union.
   ``Our plan if we move ahead is to have what we call an
unclassified post,'' staffed by five or six Americans, he said.
   The idea is not to have any sensitive material in the consulate
and thereby not make it a target for Soviet eavesdropping.

   About 100 rescue workers combed the wreckage
of a grain elevator complex today for two of three men missing
after an explosion leveled the facility, while boats dragged a
river alongside the granary for a third man, authorities said.
   Friday's explosion killed two other workers at the ADM Growmark
complex, and authorities said there was only a ``very small''
chance the three missing men were alive.
   Three others were injured in the fiery blasts.
   By morning, workers using bulldozers and cranes had cleared the
site of about 50 percent of the twisted metal, chunks of concrete
and piles of corn and soybeans left strewn over the site by the
explosion, said an official at the disaster command post who would
not identify himself.
   Dogs were used to sniff through the grain piles but had found no
sign of the missing men. Workers remained cautiously hopeful today
that they might still be alive, the official said.
   ``It would be very small, but yes of course, there is hope,'' he
said.
   Authorities believe the two blasts, which leveled grain silos
and an office building, may have been sparked by ignited grain dust.
   As many as six boats dragged the Des Plaines River for the body
of the third missing man, who was believed to have been thrown off
a barge by the force of the explosions, and four divers searched
downstream Friday, authorities said.
   Boats continued the search today, but winds and choppy water
kept divers out of the water, authorities said.
   A gnarled life jacket was found in the river, but there was no
sign of the missing man, Romeoville Fire Department Capt. John
Ramos said.
   The fiery blasts likened by witnesses to results of dynamite or
a tornado ripped through the ADM Growmark complex along the river
about 40 miles southwest of Chicago late Friday morning, officials
said.
   Authorities identified the dead as Dale Brent Slatton, 28, of
Newark, Ill. and Mark D. Stewart, 20, of Anchor. Both worked at the
elevator, Stewart part time while he studied agriculture at Joliet
Junior College.
   Joliet Police Sgt. David Saxon identified the missing as Michael
Dupris, 23, of Bourbonnais, Daniel McLaughlin, 18, of Manhattan,
Ill., and Don Zack, 30, of Joliet.
   The explosions shattered windows in homes east of the elevator
complex and sprayed grain and rubble, burying a tractor-trailer rig.
   ``I thought it sounded like a tornado or something,'' said Bob
Butterfield, 64, a Wilmington farmer who witnessed the blast. ``I
started running, but I was knocked down.''
   He said he was rolling on the ground when he saw the four,
100-foot concrete silos falling.
   ``It was falling straight down like it had disintegrated,'' he
said. ``It's gone, totaled, level complete _ just like dynamite.''
   Authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first
explosion, which apparently ruptured a natural gas main about 11
a.m. and touched off a second blast moments later, said Joliet Fire
Chief George Plese.
   ``Fairly heavy levels of dust, almost like a dense fog,'' would
have had to accumulate to set off such a powerful blast, said Ralph
Regan, a safety manager with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   Joliet Fire Batallion Chief Richard Colbert said the dust can be
``highly volatile, like petroleum.''
   David Munchalfen, a security guard at the facility, said there
had been four silos at the site, and only a sheet-metal covered
grain dryer remained standing. One of the silos, each of which
could hold about 100,000 bushels, crushed the adjacent one-story
office building.
   Bill Contos, 26, of Joliet, a boat pilot working near the
elevator site, said the second blast was ``just like a big ball of
flame the whole length of the elevator.''
   Two people were taken to St. Joseph Medical Center. One of them,
James Rayburn, 40, of Papineau was in fair condition, while the
second man was released, said spokeswoman Phyllis Oudt.
   A third injured worker was treated and released from Silver
Cross Hospital, said spokeswoman Julie Grant.

   Not yet six months old, guidelines designed to
produce uniformity in sentencing federal convicts are prompting
widespread dissatisfaction among the judges who have to impose the
prison terms.
   Judges are complaining about being turned into ``accountants,''
barred from using their judicial experience, discretion and
intuition.
   ``My general reaction is that they're unwieldy and
time-consuming,'' said U.S. District Judge Thomas Ballantine Jr. of
Louisville, Ky. He suggested the goal of the new rules, to make the
punishment fit the crime, will not always be met.
   ``I question whether a fellow who goes into a bank intending to
get $50,000 and comes away with $500 is any less culpable than the
fellow who got the whole $50,000,'' he said.
   The National Association of Criminal Lawyers last month endorsed
a challenge to the guidelines filed by a woman who must receive a
6{-year sentence in Florida for cocaine smuggling although she has
no previous record.
   There have also been other court challenges to the sentencing
guidelines, with varying results, according to NACL officials.
   The guidelines are ``cold and implacable and as immutable as a
computer,'' said James Ideman, a federal trial judge in Los Angeles
who was one of 20 judges who met last week in Pasadena to discuss
their concerns over the guidelines.
   But other judges among several interviewed by The Associated
Press said there is enough leeway to suit the aims of justice.
   ``We could still go above or below the guidelines by citing the
special circumstances of certain cases,'' said Judge Howard Munson
of Syracuse, N.Y. ``I'd like to see how it works first.''
   Judge Thomas A. Wiseman Jr. of Nashville, Tenn., said his
colleagues are ``virtually unanimous'' in believing the guidelines
will need a major overhaul.
   Wiseman, vice president of the Federal Judges Association, said
one problem is limits placed on use of probation.
   Wiseman said probation works for the overwhelming majority of
inmates who receive it as an alternative to doing time.
   Citing his own judicial district in Tennessee as an example,
Wiseman said only 7 percent of those convicted criminals given
probation since 1981 are accused of committing new crimes or
violating their probation.
   ``This tells me that supervised probation makes social good
sense because over 93 percent of these people are rehabilitated,''
he said.
   The probation system could yield savings nationwide for
taxpayers of $2 billion a year, Wiseman said, but he added that the
system is threatened by the new sentencing guidelines.
   The guidelines, adopted under a federal law and applying to
people convicted of crimes after Nov. 1, are expected to increase
the prison population by 10 percent in the next decade.
   Federal prisons now hold more than 42,000 inmates, a 75 percent
jump since 1980.
   The guidelines increase prison terms for robbery, fraud,
forgery, drug violations and a host of other crimes.
   And for the first time, federal judges are required to impose
prison terms for many white-collar criminals. For example,
corporate executives convicted of antitrust offenses such as
price-fixing must serve prison terms. Only 28 percent of those
convicted of antitrust crimes were being sent to prison previously.
   Federal appeals court Judge William Wilkins, who headed the
commission that drew up the guidelines, said a main objective is to
convince the public the criminal justice system is fair.
   ``There's a feeling in America that the white-collar criminal is
able to steal with a pencil and get away with it while the
18-year-old kid who steals with a gun goes to prison for a long
time,'' he says. ``There's something unfair and inequitable about
that system. We're going to change it.''
   But critics contend the new rules try to impose mathematical
precision on cases that demand individual attention.
   There are 43 different categories for all federal crimes, and
the length of a prison term is determined by the type of crime and
the defendant's prior criminal record.
   Minimum and maximum penalties at each level do not vary more
than 25 percent, and judges are barred from deviating unless the
case involves factors not considered by the commission that drafted
the guidelines.
   ``These guidelines have turned us almost into accountants,''
said a judge in New Jersey who requested anonymity. ``I want to
look a guy in the eye and say, `I believe in you. I've looked hard
at your case and I think you can make it.'''
   The guidelines also face a constitutional attack by federal
public defender groups who say Congress improperly delegated
legislative duties to a judicial body, the commission that drew up
the guidelines.
   It is likely to take several years for that lawsuit to reach the
Supreme Court for final resolution.

   The white marble headstone on Vladimir
Mikhalev's grave is a reminder in this bastion of World War II
valor that he died in Afghanistan, but there is no monument to
those who fought the war the Soviets didn't win.
   The Soviet Union's 115,000 troops are to begin the long-awaited
march home this spring. And the nation must deal with the problem
of how to remember those who served and those who died in
Afghanistan.
   The human losses suffered since Soviet soldiers entered
Afghanistan in December 1979 and the emotional wounds were
unmentionable topics in 1981, when Mikhalev, 23, was buried in
Chizhukovskoye cemetery among the heroes of World War II.
   The troops were sent in to defeat a revolt by anti-communists
and leave behind an Afghan army capable of standing on its own.
Neither goal was fulfilled, war weariness has set in and Soviets
are now anxious for withdrawal.
   The Afghan war has left many returning soldiers deeply disturbed
by their tour of duty in that Asian land. Drug addiction, a
predilection for violence, apathy, disease, crippling wounds and
broken marriages also are byproducts of the Afghan war.
   Significantly, the veterans are called ``the Afghans'' by many
Soviets _ a clear sign, say many returning soldiers, that they are
branded as outcasts.
   In few other cities is the contrast between the social status of
Afghan veterans and those who struggled against the Nazis more
apparent than in Minsk, a ``Hero City'' virtually destroyed in
World War II and rebuilt as a monument to Soviet suffering and
perseverance.
   Every major intersection and park has a war memorial or statue
depicting a local hero. Here and in other cities, veterans of what
is known as the Great Patriotic War proudly wear their medals and
campaign ribbons.
   But not a single memorial has been erected in the Soviet Union
to the soldiers killed in the 8-year-old Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.
   The sole reminders are the stern young faces and bronze busts of
young men staring from graveyards around the country. Few
tombstones say the youths were killed in Afghanistan, but all who
pass by know the meaning of the inscription ``he died while
fulfilling his internationalist duty.''
   At Chizhukovskoye cemetery, the plaque on Vladislav Ivanovsky's
headstone is engraved with rare directness: ``Perished in
Afghanistan.''
   An estimated 10,000 Soviets died in the war that was
unmentionable until Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for
``glasnost,'' or openness, made it acceptable conversation.
   The casualty estimates by Western sources pale in comparison
with the 20 million Soviets killed during World War II. But grief
is no easier for survivors of Afghanistan victims, and veterans
from both conflicts acknowledge the problem goes deeper than
numbers.
   ``It's been 40 years since World War II,'' Sergei Kuznetsov told
an American reporter at a recent meeting of Afghan vets in Moscow.
``We are sometimes an uncomfortable reminder to those accustomed to
peace.''
   Soviets cling to the euphemisms used to label their activity in
Afghanistan, denying it was a war, contending they never sought
victory, and always lowering their voices when the subject comes up.
   ``It cannot be said that we went there to win. We went there to
help,'' explained Alexander Maslov, a metal worker in Minsk who
alongside his twin brother Mikhail served two years in Kabul. ``The
leadership of Afghanistan asked us to help.''
   A tone of defensiveness permeates his discussion of the war.
``There is no reason to consider this a mistake,'' the 24-year-old
veteran said, referring to the Kremlin's decision to send in
troops. ``If it were necessary, we would do it again.''
   The Maslov twins contend Afghanistan veterans receive priority
for housing and jobs. Yet each lives with his wife and child in a
single room of a city dormitory.
   State-run media have come a long way in the past few years in
acknowledging that Soviet soldiers were involved in combat and that
there was resistance at home, from fearful mothers of draft-age
boys to advisers at the top levels of power.
   The Soviets' experience in Afghanistan is similar to U.S.
soldiers' service in Vietnam. But the Vietnam War was brought home
to Americans daily through media coverage that focused as much on
individual suffering as on the political issues involved.
   In contrast, Soviet media have carefully sanitized reports to
cast the conflict as a ``situation around Afghanistan'' brought
about by imperialist interference.
   Spurred on by glasnost, about 2,000 Afghanistan veterans groups
have sprung up around the country to talk to school children about
their service, to help widows and mothers, and to talk over
experiences they say outsiders don't understand.
   In Moscow, Sergei Kuznetsov's group, which gathers on occasional
Saturdays, has found a medium in song for issues most of the men
find difficult to openly discuss.
   The mournful ballads about buddies killed in battle and the
frustration of fighting a distant and little understood war have
been collected and issued by the Young Guard recording company.
   One song reflects veterans' disillusionment, and a glimmer of
the belief that Soviet involvement in a foreign civil war was
pointless. In part, it says:
   ``They fight for the prophet Mohammed,
   ``While we defend only our Soviet truck.''
   ``The Return,'' a short documentary making its way into Soviet
theaters, for the first time shows wounded soldiers and blown up
tanks, and talks with troubled veterans and a bereaved mother.
   ``I'm a terrible enemy of this war,'' says a tearful Klavdia
Ilyin, with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the
background. ``I don't see why our children are there.''
   Newspapers have announced fund-raising campaigns to erect
monuments to the ``soldier-internationalists,'' and articles in the
national dailies have decried the second-class treatment of Afghan
veterans by those who don't want to be reminded of the war.
   ``Most people think our boys have been down there planting
flowers and building roads,'' observed one World War II veteran in
Moscow. ``How can they earn the respect they deserve when so few
know what they have done?''

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
said Saturday he's not sure Jesse Jackson is even interested in the
No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket, adding that he and Jesse
Jackson have ``one overriding goal'' _ a Democratic victory in
November.
   The Massachusetts governor continued to take shots at the Reagan
administration on a variety of issues, testing themes for the fall
campaign now that he has moved into a commanding position in the
Democratic nomination fight.
   Foreign policy and Attorney General Edwin Meese's problems at
the Justice Department were his targets for Saturday.
   ``I'm not here to beat up on the current administration _ they
have have enough problems _ and the Justice Department especially
these days, if there is a Justice Department,'' Dukakis told about
300 people at the old Bethlehem Steel headquarters in the Lehigh
Valley.
   Dukakis campaigned hard across Pennsylvania in preparation for
Tuesday's primary. He also made a quick trip to Gary, Ind., in
advance of that state's May 3 balloting.
   Dukakis and Jackson faced each other in a second debate in as
many days in Pittsburgh Saturday night.
   At the Bethlehem event, Dukakis was asked about Jackson's
interest in the vice presidential nomination.
   ``That is not what he said. I asked him if he were interested
but he didn't tell me,'' Dukakis said of an exchange they had in
the Friday night debate in Philadelphia.
   ``As you could see last night, Jesse and I have a very good
relationship. We respect each other,'' Dukakis said .``We happen to
be very positive people. We both understand that there is one
overriding goal in this campaign and that is to win in November.''
   Dukakis has a big lead in the polls in Pennsylvania, which has a
beauty contest primary and separate elections for national
convention delegates.
   ``Every single primary is important. Please don't pay any
attention to the polls,'' he told the union members. ``We need a
big turnout. Everybody has to vote. And you have to vote not only
for me but for my delegates.''
   Dukakis began his day standing in front of the freighter
Tradewind at dockside in North Philadelphia, talking of
federal-local partnerships when music suddenly blared.
   ``What have we got here, a symphony behind me?'' said the
Massachusetts governor, turning toward the ship.
   Then he noticed the Greek flag being waved from the ship's
bridge.
   ``We're going to have a brief pause while we all appreciate
this,'' which he said sounded like a Greek battle hymn from the
Revolution fo 1821. ``This is too much.''
   The Greek-American politician is a far more relaxed campaigner
now that he has opened a big lead over Jackson. He mixes pleas for
a big turnout Tuesday with themes that he would use as the party's
nominee in the fall.
   ``We're going to take back the presidency for the Democratic
Party and for the country in November. It's out there to be won.
The people of this countryare ready for a change. You know and I
know. We hear it every day,'' Dukakis told about 100 people at a
Machinists Union hall, his second stop Saturday morning. ``They
want an Attorney General we can be proud of, not an Atorney General
we're embarrassed about.''
   Dukakis recalls his upset in the 1978 Democratic primary _ when
he as the incumbent lost to a lesser-know conservative candidate
after leading by 50 points in the polls.
   ``We were all looking at our statistics and we weren't
remembering that it's out on the ballfield where you have to win
that game,'' he said.
   As he has in recent days since his major New York vicory last
Tuesday, Dukakis have emphasized the tone he wants to set in the
campaign, a theme those who appear with him have adopted.
   ``He's going to take the high road all the way to Atlanta and
all the way to the White House,'' said Rep. Bob Borski, D-Pa.,
introducing Dukakis at the union hall.
   In particuarly, Dukakis rejects any suggestion of criticism of
Jackson.
   ``It's important that we run a strong and positive campaign,''
Dukakis said. ``I don't think the American people are interested in
what I think of Jesse Jackson or what he thinks of me. They want to
know what kind of leadership we're going to provide for this
country. They want to know whether I have the strenght, the values,
the experience and and the ability to lead this country''
   He has also been working on how to include his cousin Olympia _
who won an Oscar for best supporting actress two weeks ago _ in his
stump speech.
   ``This has been an incredible two weeks for the Dukakis
family...Who else but my cousin would hold up that Oscar in front
of a billion and half of people and say `Okay, Michael let's go.'
   ``That's our cry _ `Let's go'.'' ~

<HEAD>U.S. Studies Chinese Comments on Iran Arms Embargo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is studying the
Chinese reaction to the U.S. attacks on Iranian targets in the
Persian Gulf to see if Beijing has reversed its willingness to go
along with an arms embargo against Iran, U.S. officials said
Saturday.
   Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, informed Chinese
authorities about the U.S. decision to retaliate against Iran for a
mine explosion that damaged an American warship, and discussed the
issue with Chinese authorities, said the U.S. officials, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The United States has been pushing other Security Council
members to enact an arms embargo against Iran for refusing to
accept a call by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar for
a truce in the 7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   While lobbying for the embargo, the United States has been
seeking continuous reassurances from China that it will not
exercise its veto power if the rest of the U.N. Security Council
approves the ban.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian said during a visit to
Washington last month that his government thought the ban was a
poor idea, but would not block it.
   In their latest comments, the Chinese repeated their view that
an arms embargo would be a mistake and expressed concern that the
clashes in the gulf are creating an improper atmosphere for Perez
de Cuellar's mediation efforts, the officials said.
   The Chinese did not say point blank they would veto an arms
embargo, one official said. Nevertheless, he said, some U.S.
government experts believe the Chinese comments may represent a
step away from their earlier vow of passivity.
   China's concern about an Iranian arms embargo is more than
diplomatic. Its arms industry has sold billions of dollars of
weapons to both sides in the Iran-Iraq war, notably Silkworm
anti-ship missiles that have been fired at vessels in the Persian
Gulf.
   The officials noted that China's view on the arms embargo
remains a moot point because the Soviet Union _ another member of
the Security Council _ has refused to go along at all. The latest
refusal came on Friday during Secretary of State George P. Shultz'
talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow.
   ``You could argue it's not totally clear what the Chinese will
do,'' one official said. ``But at this point it doesn't seem to
make much difference because the Soviets are still clearly opposed
to the resolution.''

   Here is the text of President Reagan's
weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday from his Camp David
retreat:
   My fellow Americans, there's a memorable bit of dialogue between
Claude Raines and Humphrey Bogart in the movie ``Casablanca.''
Raines, playing the Vichy French police inspector, asked Bogart why
he came to Casablanca, and Bogart says, ``It was for the waters.''
   ``But this is the desert,'' replies Raines. ``There are no
waters here.'' And Bogart, unflappable as ever responds, ``I was
misinformed.''
   Well, when it comes to the issue of trade, the American people
have been misinformed. We seem to hear every night on the evening
news that the trade deficit is looming over our economy,
threatening at any moment to plunge us back into a second great
depression.
   Well, I'm sorry to disappoint these doomcriers, but the economy
is strong and getting stronger. What you don't hear so often in the
news is that the trade deficit has turned around. Exports are at
record levels, factories are expanding, and more Americans have
jobs than ever before in our history.
   Whether it's cars, steel, or high technology, the label ``Made
in the USA,'' is seen more and more around the world. This good
news doesn't get reported too much because the rising price of
imports makes it seem like we're importing more. The truth is, when
you account for price changes the trade deficit has decreased, and
is now 20 percent smaller than it was during the third quarter of
1986.
   The fearmongers had their high day, or their hey day I should
say, last October, when the stock market fell 508 points in one day
of trading. Many blamed the merchandise trade deficit and predicted
a dire future for the U.S. economy. Depression, recession,
catastrophe and calamity was all we heard.
   Well, I said at the time, the U.S. economy was in great shape,
and in fact in the six months since Black Monday, we've seen
unemployment drop from 5.9 percent to 5.5 percent, the lowest since
1974. We've had six more months of real growth in the longest
peacetime expansion in U.S. history, and that growth has been
impressive _ 4.8 percent during the last quarter of 1987. Some
catastrophe.
   Not simply content with predicting disaster, some in Congress
have put together legislation that would damage our ability to
compete with our trading partners. Everyone talks about wanting a
level playing field. But what Congress would be doing is putting
American workers and industries on the field with one hand tied
behind their backs.
   They call this a trade bill, but there's a lot in it that has
nothing to do with trade. Yes, I want a trade bill. And we've been
working with Congress in good faith to produce a bill that would
open markets and improve America's competitiveness. But we must
guard against enacting legislation that would reverse the gains of
the past five years.
   The draft legislation does contain a number of important
measures. It enhances our negotiating authority in the ongoing
international trade talks, repeals the windfall profits tax, and
creates a retraining program for workers who have been laid off. We
strongly support these measures. But it also contains provisions
that are unacceptable.
   I've made it very clear to Congress I will veto this bill, and
I'm confident that my veto will be sustained. Then I'll work
vigorously to secure responsible trade legislation and urge the
congressional leadership to schedule prompt action on the new bill.
As long as I'm president, we're going to keep traveling the road
we're on _ one of free and fair trade, record sustained growth, job
creation, rising incomes and technological leadership into the 21st
century.
   Now, I'd like to turn for a moment to events this past week in
the Persian Gulf. The actions that our forces took in the Gulf were
a measured response to Iran's resumption of mine-laying and
continued aggression against nonbelligerents. We have completed
these self-defense actions and consider this incident closed. I am
extremely proud of the courage and resourcefulness of our military
personnel in the Persian Gulf. Their performance under very
difficult circumstances has been superb.
   We're also very pleased with the role the European allies are
playing in a cooperative effort to counter the Iranian mining
threat and to help protect freedom of navigation. Such cooperative
effort supported by our Gulf Arab friends offer the best means of
deterring Iran and enhancing Gulf security.
   Working together, we can also put new life into the U.N.
Security Council's efforts to end the increasingly bloody, inhumane
Iran-Iraq war, and remove the root cause of tensions in the Gulf.
Our role in this war is neutral, and we do not seek to confront
Iran. However, its leaders must understand that continued military
and terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to
negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to Iran and its
people.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   Here is the text of the Democratic Party's
weekly radio address, as delivered Saturday by Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia:
   This is Senator Byrd. I have good news. Congress is one step
closer to passing the long-awaited trade bill. Last Thursday, the
House of Representatives did its part. The trade bill passed
overwhelmingly.
   Now, it is our turn in the Senate. Next week we are going to
send the trade bill to the president for his signature.
   The trade deficit has got to come down. America's standard of
living is being threatened. There are more of us working, but fewer
of us owning homes. In most families, it takes two people working
to keep the American dream in sight. And everyone is looking over
their shoulders, worried about the next crash on Wall Street.
   Year by year, we have slipped further into debt. The trade
deficit, like the budget deficit, is in triple digits. The trade
deficit is up again. That means fewer jobs for Americans.
   With this trade bill America will be telling the world: ``Watch
out, you've got competition.'' We will be telling the world that
America expects fair competition: ``If you get access to our
markets, we get access to yours.''
   The trade bill is a positive step for America. It is a good
bill. This bill creates programs for retraining workers, and gives
the president new tools to open up markets to American products. It
is not protectionist.
   The trade bill is comprehensive. It covers everything from
exchange rates to better education for our children. The trade bill
establishes a strong new export policy. At the same time, it
protects American inventions from piracy by foreign firms. In
addition, this trade bill prevents foreign investors from
dominating industries vital to our national security.
   This trade bill is a reasonable response to a trade policy that
hs gone awry. It opens up new markets, invests in people and ideas,
and creates new opportunities for American industries and workers
to work together _ to make America competitive again.
   We are at the 11th hour when it comes to dealing with our
nation's trade deficit. This is no time to dilly-dally. America has
got to get moving again. The trade bill gets us moving in the right
direction.
   But all this is at risk if the president vetoes the trade bill.
Despite months of working with the president, the Congress is still
unsure of his support. The president is still waving his veto pen
in the air.
   The president is upset that the trade bill includes one small
section to protect workers from suddenly being laid off without
notice. That's the issue: the plant-closing legislation that you
have been hearing about.
   Our bill says if your factory is going to close and you are
going to lose your job, you have a right to know 60 days in
advance. That is simple justice, simple decency. Right now, many
workers get only a week or two or a day or two of warning that
their jobs are about to disappear. About a third of all American
workers get no notice at all.
   The administration does not like this provision. I think the
administration is dead wrong. What they are saying is this: ``It is
OK to give golden parachutes to the big guys, but it is not OK to
give the little guy a warning that he is about to lose his job.''
Is that fair? Of course not.
   I have seen the impact of factories suddenly closing in my own
state of West Virginia. Men and women who have loyally worked for
years for a company suddenly are handed pink slips without warning.
``Go stand on the unemployment line. All your hard work does not
count.'' That's the message.
   The choice is simple. If the president stands up for America, he
will sign the trade bill. There will be no veto. It will be a great
day. If the president vetoes the trade bill, he will be sending
another message: The big boys with the golden parachutes count more
than the little guy.
   Mr. President, at the 11th hour, don't turn back the clock. We
need new policies, not old politics. Mr. President, put away your
veto pen and sign the trade bill when it comes to your desk.

   President Reagan predicted Saturday that
Congress will uphold his intended veto of a sweeping world trade
bill expected to be sent to his desk in the coming week.
   Senate Democratic leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia,
however, urged the president to sign the bill because ``it is no
time to dillydally'' on the trade issue.
   Reagan and Byrd exchanged views in the president's weekly radio
address, delivered from Camp David, and the weekly Democratic
response to the presidential talk.
   ``Some in Congress have put together legislation that would
damage our ability to compete with our trading partners,'' the
president said. ``Everyone talks about wanting a level playing
field, but what Congress would be doing is putting American
industries and workers on the field with one hand tied behind their
backs.''
   ``I have made it very clear to Congress that I will veto this
bill and I am confident that my veto will be sustained,'' he said.
   ``Then I will work vigorously to secure responsible trade
legislation and urge the congressional leadership to schedule
prompt action on the new bill,'' Reagan said.
   Byrd told his radio audience, ``We are at the 11th hour when it
comes to dealing with our nation's trade deficit. This is no time
to dillydally.''
   The majority leader took aim at Reagan's opposition to a
provision in the bill that would require businesses with more than
100 employees to give 60 days' notice before closing a plant or
instituting mass layoffs. Reagan says this provision, supported by
organized labor, would damage the competitive position of American
business and cause the loss of American jobs.
   Byrd, however, called the provision ``simple justice, simple
decency.''
   ``Right now, many workers get only a week or two or a day or two
of warning that their jobs are about to disappear,'' he said.
``About a third of all American workers get no notice at all.''
   ``If the president stands up for America, he will sign the trade
bill,'' said Byrd. ``If the president vetoes the trade bill he will
be sending another message: the big boys with the golden parachutes
count more than the little guy.''
   ``Mr. President, put away your veto pen and sign the trade bill
when it comes to your desk,'' Byrd advised.
   It takes a two-thirds majority of both houses to pass a bill
into law over a veto by the president. The House passed the measure
312-107 on Thursday. A vote in the Senate is expected in mid-week.
   The bill would strengthen laws against foreign unfair trade
practices, expand protection for workers who lose their jobs
because of imports, give the president authority to negotiate a new
global trade agreement and punish the Toshiba Corp. and a Norwegian
company for selling sensitive technology to the Soviets.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pickup truck packed with TNT exploded
in a crowded vegetable market in this northern port city Saturday,
killing 54 and wounding 125 in Lebanon's bloodiest such bombing in
nearly three years.
   Tripoli's eight hospitals and clinics were filled to capacity
with victims of the 8:45 a.m. (2:45 a.m. EDT) blast in the
low-income Tabbaneh district. The explosion knocked down several
buildings, gutted shops and set fire to dozens of cars.
   Police said the black Mercedes pickup was loaded with vegetables
and rigged with an estimated 330 pounds of TNT. It went off as the
area filled with midmorning shoppers on the seventh day of Islam's
holy month of Ramadan, when Moslems fast during daylight hours.
   ``Tongues of fire shot up into the air and I felt the earth
shaking under me. I fainted,'' said Ibtissam Khodor, a Moslem
housewife who was shopping when the truck exploded. She spoke from
her bed at Nini Hospital.
   Nine-year-old Ahmed Touni wept as medical attendants pulled a
white sheet over the body of his 29-year-old mother at the Islamic
hospital.
   ``My mother died. I have no mom,'' he cried.
   No group claimed responsibility for the bombing in Lebanon's
second-largest city, and police said they have no clues about who
the bombers are or their motive.
   Earlier car bombings have been blamed on the civil war between
Syrian-backed Moslems and Israeli-backed Christians as well as
other feuds involving Palestinians, Syrians and Israelis.
   Tripoli is 50 miles north of Beirut and has a predominantly
Sunni Moslem population of 850,000.
   Saturday's explosion was the first major car bombing in Lebanon
this year. Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni, condemned it
as a ``barbaric atrocity.''
   ``All hands must team up to stop these executioners from
committing further such crimes,'' he said.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity
according to regulations, said that ``several pedestrians and
vendors were torn to pieces.''
   He said Syrian troops in charge of Tripoli's security cordoned
off the scene of the blast as ambulances with wailing sirens rushed
victims to hospitals.
   Radio stations broadcast hospital appeals for urgent blood
donations. Police said hospital morgues were ``packed with corpses,
many of them burned or mutilated beyond identification.''
   The car bomb was parked near a wall of a cemetery at the
entrance to Tabbaneh's vegetable market. Several shops were gutted
and dozens of cars parked nearby were reduced to smoldering piles
of twisted metal.
   Many buildings collapsed and civil defense teams dug through the
rubble in search of trapped victims. Firemen doused the scene with
water to extinguish fires touched off by the blast. Glass shards
littered a 150-yard radius.
   Police said this was the worst car bombing since an
explosive-laden vehicle exploded outside an ice cream parlor in
Tripoli on June 29, 1985, killing 60 and wounding 100.
   Five people have been killed and 15 wounded in four relatively
small bomb attacks in Beirut and Tripoli in the past three months.
But there have been no car bombings.
   Last year 57 people were killed and 288 wounded in 16 car bomb
explosions in various parts of Lebanon, according to Lebanese
police reports.
   Car bombs are a byproduct of Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
More than 130,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke
out in April 1975.

   President Reagan warned Iran's leaders
Saturday that continued attacks on neutral countries and refusal to
negotiate an end to the Persian Gulf war ``will be very costly to
Iran and its people.''
   The president, in his weekly radio address delivered from Camp
David, Md., said, ``We do not seek to confront Iran.''
   But, he said, Iran's ``leaders must understand that continued
military and terrorist attacks against non-belligerents and refusal
to negotiate an end to the war will be very costly to Iran and its
people.''
   Reagan's tough comments came a day after administration
officials let it be known that under a new policy, the United
States will allow American warships to assist neutral vessels under
attack in the gulf.
   The United States, while remaining officially neutral in the
7{-year-old Iran-Iraq war, has guarded American-flagged Kuwaiti
tankers from attack since last summer.
   But the escort policy was expanded to allow U.S. warships to aid
neutral merchant ships under attack after the U.S. frigate Roberts
struck a mine in the gulf on April 14. Under the old rules, which
permitted retaliation only for attacks on American-flagged ships,
U.S. forces retaliated last Monday, sinking or crippling six
Iranian vessels that challenged them after the Americans destroyed
two offshore platforms.
   ``The actions that our forces took in the gulf were a measured
response to Iran's resumption of mine laying and continued
aggression against non-belligerents,'' the president said.
   ``We have completed these self-defense actions and consider this
incident closed.''
   In a statement on the gulf Saturday, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the
United States must face the issue of whether an intelligence
failure was involved in the Iranian mine-laying incident.
   ``Iran's minelayers have clearly found a large hole in our
procedures _ a hole large enough to drive at least two minefields
through,'' he said. ``We have to assume, for planning purposes,
that more minefields have already been laid, and we also have to
assume that more minefields will now be laid.''
   Aspin had said earlier that he suspected the mines were not laid
on orders from the Tehran government, but by revolutionary
malcontents. ``Regardless of who in Iran ordered the minelaying, we
are back to a state of confrontation,'' he said Saturday.
   The president, in his radio speech, said that he is ``extremely
proud of the courage and resourcefulness of our military personnel
in the Persian Gulf. Their performance under very difficult
circumstances has been superb.
   ``We are also very pleased with the role that the European
allies are playing in a cooperative effort to counter the Iranian
mining threat and to help protect freedom of navigation. Such
cooperative efforts, supported by our gulf Arab friends, offer the
best means of deterring Iran and enhancing gulf security.''
   ``Working together, we can also put new life into the U.N.
Security Council's efforts to end the increasingly bloody, inhumane
Iran-Iraq war and remove the root cause of tensions in the gulf,''
Reagan said.

<HEAD>Alabama May Be First State To Get `Survivable' Shelter For
Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NEWBERRY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Alabama has been chosen as the site for
the nation's first survivable state emergency operating center, a
disaster-proof shelter designed to allow state government to keep
running even during a nuclear attack.
   ``Many EOC's date back to the 1950s,'' said Bill McAda, a
spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ``We're
looking for a modern approach to civil defense.''
   If funding is approved by the state Legislature, the facility
would provide safe haven for the governor and other top officials
to direct evacuation procedures and other emergency operations
during a nuclear attack.
   ``The population would be in disarray,'' said J. Danny Cooper,
director of the state Emergency Management Agency. ``They would be
confused and afraid. ... They would have confidence in those they
have placed in high public office.''
   The federal agency chose Alabama to receive $1.1 million in
funding to build the center, but only if Alabama provides matching
funds. Cooper said the state was chosen based on its letter of
intent guaranteeing the center would provide for the number of
state officials and personnel needed to coordinate disaster
operations and resources.
   Cooper said recently that the facility has not yet been
designed, but it would have to be a subterranean, windowless
facility capable of accommodating as many as 270 members of state
government ``necessary to ensure a return to normalcy.'' That would
include the governor, top Cabinet officials, legislative leaders
and judges.
   Walls several feet thick would protect inhabitants from
radioactivity and a ventilation system would filter the air. Wells
would be dug to provide an adequate water supply for at least two
weeks.
   ``It would not be the Grand Hotel,'' said Cooper, referring to
an exclusive resort on Mobile Bay. ``It would provide food,
clothing and shelter.''
   More importantly, Cooper said, would be the center's
state-of-the-art communications capability, including retractable
antennas and equipment that would be functional even under
radioactive conditions. Such technology already is in place at
federal facilities.
   ``During a nuclear exchange, the atmosphere would eliminate
radio communications,'' he said. ``Our facility would be the
national model of a communications system that can function
regardless of the situation.''
   In addition to a nuclear attack, the center could be used during
hurricanes, tornadoes or any other natural or technological
disaster, such as a crisis at the state's two nuclear power plants.
   McAda said most states have some kind of emergency operations
center, but FEMA determined in a recent study that their
capabilities were ``low and declining.''
   ``The continuity of government concept is one that FEMA will be
pursuing very vigorously in the future,'' said Cooper.

   Many U.S. Navy officers in the Persian
Gulf eagerly had awaited the top-level policy change that now
allows them to intervene in Iranian attacks on neutral merchant
ships.
   Some expressed outrage in the past nine months over Iran's
gunboat attacks on unarmed shipping and their own inability to do
anything about them.
   ``It's like being a world-class athlete who's always ready for
the event but never gets to participate,'' Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn,
skipper of the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts, said recently.
   The sweeping policy change may encounter strong objections in
Congress. Many lawmakers have opposed any step that could draw the
United States into more confrontation with Iran, which has been
fighting neighboring Iraq for seven and a half years.
   The U.S. Naval command in the Middle East had no official
reaction Saturday to the policy swing. A spokesman for the U.S.
Joint Task Force Middle East, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
declined comment, saying it was a matter for discussion among high
administration officials.
   But many U.S. officers have privately made their feelings known
in past months.
   Only two days before the Reagan administration announced the
policy change Friday, a senior Navy commander described an incident
in which he had to order one of his frigates to pull back from an
Iranian attack on a non-U.S. flagged vessel.
   ``The captain knew the rules, but he really wanted to go after
the Iranian,'' said the officer, who spoke privately. ``He asked
for permission. I told him `no, back off.' He was pretty unhappy. I
had to say it twice.''
   Such officers have spoken hopefully of a policy change that
would enable them to bring their firepower to bear.
   ``If the Iranians were going to attack one of our convoys,
they'd probably have done it by now,'' one senior officer said.
``But it's pretty discouraging to watch them attacking these other
people and not be able to do anything to stop it.''
   Under a policy in effect since July, when the U.S. Navy began
escorting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers, American warships could
defend only ships flying American flags.
   The policy, included in so-called rules of engagement, allowed
the warships to provide humanitarian aid to a non-U.S. flagged
vessel in distress but only if the ship asked for it. They could
not intervene against the attacker.
   Thus, U.S. warships bristling with weapons were forced to stand
off while Iranian gunboats like the Sabalan _ the ``frigate Nasty''
as one Norwegian captain calls it _ blazed away at unarmed vessels
with virtual impunity. The Sabalan, which usually goes for the crew
quarters of its targets, was severely damaged by U.S. bombs in
clashes Monday.
   Indeed, the plan for a more active role in the gulf is a direct
result of the mining of a U.S. frigate and Monday's extensive
fighting between Iranian and U.S. forces, administration officials
said Friday. U.S. forces sank or crippled six Iranian vessels that
challenged them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in
retaliation for the mining of the U.S. vessel.
   The Washington officials stressed that the policy change does
not mean the U.S. Navy will assume a broader role escorting
merchant ships.
   ``It's a random, target-of-opportunity approach, designed to
throw the Iranians off guard,'' said one Washington official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``This will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a
lot of leeway to do as they see fit,'' said another.
   Some officers say hints of a policy shift had been in the wind
for months. They speculated that the move came as a result of other
high-level changes, including Frank Carlucci replacing Caspar
Weinberger as defense secretary.
   Rear Adm. Harold Bernsen, former commander of the U.S. Middle
East Force in the gulf, was reported last year to have been denied
expanded operating authority.
   Some officers felt that Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, a two-star
admiral who replaced Bernsen in late February, was in a position _
if he wanted _ to argue the case anew with more clout.
   One senior officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
believed a policy reappraisal was necessary because the U.S.
presence had not effectively discouraged Iranian threats to
international shipping.
   ``The Kuwait convoys have been a big success, but the gulf is
still a dangerous place for any ships not under that kind of
escort,'' he said.

   Politicians and diplomats say
President Jose Azcona's already weak government has been crippled
because of its apparent inability to stand up to the United States.
   Interviews with prominent Hondurans, as well as talks with
foreign envoys and people in the street, indicated that citizens of
this old friend of the United States are peeved with what they see
as Yankee high-handedness.
   Local politicians said a series of events have prompted a
fundamental review of U.S.-Honduran relations, which they said
probably will change definitively, if not drastically.
   In recent days, Hondurans have bristled at the transportation of
a Honduran national to the United States on cocaine charges, done
even though the Honduran Constitution prohibts extradition of
Honduran citizens.
   Many are angry about the use of Honduran territory by the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels in their fight against the Nicarguan
government.
   And the maneuvers of 3,200 American troops in Honduras last
month were also seen by many as another example of U.S. dominance.
   Even a presidential decision Monday to award a
multimillion-dollar compensation to a U.S. citizen whose farm was
expropriated in 1982 has incurred the people's wrath.
   ``Yankee garbage out of Honduras,'' and ``If the Yankees don't
get out, in Honduras they will die,'' about 2,000 people chanted as
they marched in the capital Thursday.
   The chants, which rhyme in Spanish, would have sounded foreign
on so many voices just a few months ago.
   The march came two weeks after a mob sacked and burned the U.S.
Consulate.
   The demonstrators, like others, say Azcona's submission to U.S.
wishes in recent months has reached the point where Honduran
insitutions, including the Constitution, are blatantly ignored.
   Despite the ire of the students who made up the core of the
marchers, most Hondurans are far from anti-American. Those
consulted last week seemed especially hurt because the perceived
slights are coming from a friend.
   ``Matta as an individual has no importance. He was just a
detonator,'' said Manuel Acosta Bonilla, a lawyer and member of the
directorate of the opposition National Party.
   He was referring to Juan Ramon Matta, who was arrested April 5
and hustled out of the country and into the federal penetentiary in
Marion, Ill., by Honduran authorities working closely with U.S.
officials.
   Matta, considered an international cocaine kingpin, was one of
the U.S. Druge Enforcement Agency's most wanted men.
   ``If they can kidnap Matta, they can kidnap anybody's brother,''
said truck driver Marcos Lezama. ``The servileness of this
president has no name.''
   ``There is complete indignation because of poor management of
this (Matta) situation,'' said Carlos Montoya, president of
Congress and a presidential hopeful for Azcona's Liberal Party in
fall 1989 elections.
   ``The image of Azcona has been eroded,'' he said. But Montoya
said he doesn't think a military coup is possible.
   ``The U.S. Congress would cut off aid, and the economic
situation here would go from bad to worse,'' he said.
   The armed forces governed Honduras for nearly 20 years before a
return to civilian rule in 1982. The military still continues to
exercise much political power.
   Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, with
50 percent unemployment or underemployment, 60 percent illiteracy
and a per capita annual gross national product of just over $750.
   Gilberto Goldstein, a National Party legislator, agreed that a
coup was almost out of the question ``because everyone involved
would lose.''
   He said these are trying times for what had until a few months
ago been an island of relative tranquility amid Central America's
turmoil.
   ``But some good comes out of this,'' he said. ``It will make the
United States realize its relations with Honduras must be
profoundly reanalyzed.''
   According to Acosta Bonilla, ``It doesn't matter that the small
left takes up this banner of resentment. But it (the resentment)
will consolidate the broader center-left for a revision of the
status quo.''
   Meza said the presidential candidate who taps into this
resentment will have an advantage.
   ``Our presidential campaign is virtually underway,'' he said,
``and no one who hopes to win can fail to take this resentment into
account.''

   The devil had better think twice about
wrestling with the five Assemblies of God ministers known as The
Power Team.
   These preachers crash chest-first through stacks of 2-by-4's,
break free of handcuffs and bend 1-inch steel rods between their
teeth _ all in the name of the Lord.
   ``If I walk into an auditorium in a suit and tie, probably
nobody would notice or listen,'' John Jacobs, the team founder,
told a crowd in Louisville last week. ``But if I break ice, crush
concrete and break out of handcuffs, it gets people's attention.''
   Capacity crowds of 3,000 screaming, cheering people showed up at
the Evangel Christian Life Center several nights last week to see
the team, which is made up of former professional athletes who all
are in their 20s.
   ``Tonight is for radicals only,'' Jacobs told one crowd. ``Men
pushing their bodies to the limit. But most important, they love
God. So, fasten your seat belts.''
   Jacobs, who weighs more than 300 pounds and has 21-inch biceps,
showed his stuff by freeing himself from two pairs of handcuffs.
Former Indiana University football star Berry Handley crashed
chest-first through a stack of 2-by-4's.
   And former Seattle Seahawks running back Mike Hagen, who boasts
of a 54-inch chest, crushed two 5-foot-thick slabs of ice with his
triceps.
   Team members competed to see which one would be first to blow up
a thick rubber hot-water bottle until it burst, bend a 1-inch steel
rod between his teeth and then snap a baseball bat across his knees.
   ``Hollywood has always shown Christians as sissies,'' Jacobs
said, ``but it takes more courage to live for God than anything
else in the world. Jesus was a real man.''

   A Greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile
plane 74 miles over the Aegean sea Saturday and broke the world
record for human-powered flight, but the aircraft was destroyed in
a crash landing.
   A gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight Daedalus
88, which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing
area on the island of Santorini 3{ hours after leaving the island
of Crete.
   ``It happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was
done. I didn't worry about it,'' the athlete-pilot, Kanellos
Kanellopoulos, told a news conference in the Greek capital. He was
not injured in the crash.
   ``The situation in the landing area was too rough for this
plane, which is built for calm conditions. I was under full control
but the tail boom couldn't take the pressure,'' said Kanellopoulos,
who also broke the records for endurance and straight-line
human-powered flight.
   Kanellopoulos, 31, Greek cycling champion for the past 14 years,
was flown to Athens aboard an army helicopter shortly after the
rough landing near the black sands of Perissa beach, on the
southeast face of the volcanic island also known as Thira.
   The 72-pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane, designed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, fell after hitting a wind
parallel to the beach, said MIT professor Mark Drela, who was in
one of the boats following the flight.
   But Drela, the senior engineer responsible for the plane's
aerodynamic design, said the project was ``definitely a success.''
   More than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the
beach to watch the plane, resembling oversized insect, glide
towards the sand.
   The snapped tail boom caused the plane's huge 112-foot long
wings to break, dropping the pink-and-silver aircraft 10 feet into
the water.
   ``I was underwater so I forced my way through the cockpit and
dove under the plane. Then I swam to shore,'' the tanned, blond
cyclist said.
   Kanellopoulos pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for
3 hours and 55 minutes to fly from Heraklion air base to Santorini.
   He lifted off at 7:06 a.m. (12:30 a.m. EDT) and landed at 11:00
a.m. (4 a.m. EDT).
   The flight was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth of
Daedalus, a Greek architect, sculptor and engineer who flapped his
way across the Aegean from Crete on wings of feathers and wax.
Daedalus' son, Icarus, flew too close to the sun, which melted the
wax, causing him to to fall to his death.
   The previous world record for human-powered flight was set by
the Light Eagle, a Daedalus 88 prototype piloted by Glenn Tremml,
who flew 37.2 miles around Edwards Air Base in California in
January 1987.
   Kanellopoulos also shattered the record for straight-line
human-powered flight set in 1979 by Bryan Allen, who pedaled the
Gossamer Albatross 22{ miles across the English Channel.
   The third record broken was for flight duration. The previous
mark was held by Allen, with a time of 2 hours, 49 minutes.
   Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue
craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the Aegean.
   The flight came after a 36-member team of MIT experts waited for
three weeks on the wind-swept island of Crete for a suitable day to
attempt the flight.
   Essential requirements were a calm sea, southerly winds of less
than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degress Fahrenheit and
visibility to the horizon, according to Steve K. Bussolari, an MIT
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations.
   ``Conditions for the flight were ideal. We even had a southerly
tailwind,'' Bussolari said.
   The southerly tailwind pushed the Daedalus 88 over the Agean
waters at a rate faster than expected by the MIT team, with the
plane averaging 18.5 miles per hour, team officials said. They had
not expected the ungainly flying machine to go over 14 miles per
hour.
   ``We were predicting the low speeds because we had been
estimating headwinds, which are prevalent. We have no idea where
the tailwinds came from,'' said project news director Ken Campbell.
   In addition to Kanellopoulos, three other athlete-pilots had
been standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible
record flight.
   They were Francis Scioscia, 27, of Scranton, Pa., Greg Zack, 26,
of Wilmington, N.C., and 27-year-old Tremml, the former
world-record holder and a medical student from New Haven, Conn.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Navy Retrieves Remains Of Downed Helicopter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's Revolutionary Guards on Saturday
retrieved remains of an American helicopter allegedly shot down by
Iranian forces in a showdown with the U.S. Navy, Tehran Radio
reported.
   The state-run broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said naval units
of the Revolutionary Guards found the remains in the Persian Gulf
and brought them ashore.
   It said inspection proved the parts belonged ``to the U.S. Cobra
helicopter which was shot by the Iranian forces and crashed in the
gulf'' on Monday.
   The U.S. Navy blasted two offshore Iranian oil platforms on
Monday, touching off the most serious engagement with the Iranians
since the American warships began escorting reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers in the gulf last July.
   The U.S. Navy sank or seriously damaged two Iranian naval
frigates and four smaller frigates, and fired on Iranian jets in
the a clash.
   Pentagon officials said in Washington that a U.S. helicopter
with a two-man crew was missing in that confrontation.
   Iran said its forces shot it down. But that report has not been
independently confirmed.
   Washington said the attack on the Iranian platforms was a
``measured response'' for a mine explosion that holed the American
frigate Samuel B. Roberts April 15, wounding 10 crew members.
   The United States blamed Iran for sowing mines in the gulf and
U.S. mine sweepers on Friday destroyed five such explosives.
   Pentagon officials said the Navy examined the mines before they
were detonated and found that they had been manufactured by Iran.
   In Washington, President Reagan warned Iran's leaders that
continued attacks on neutral countries and refusal to negotiate an
end to the Persian Gulf war ``will be very costly to Iran and its
people.''
   The president, in his weekly radio address delivered from Camp
David, Md., said, ``We do not seek to confront Iran.''
   On Friday, Reagan administration officials said that United
States will now allow American warships to assist neutral vessels
under attack in the gulf.
   Since last summer, the U.S. Navy has protected 11
American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from Iranian attack.
   But the escort policy was expanded to allow U.S. warships to aid
neutral merchant ships under attack after the Roberts struck the
mine April 14.
   Reagan said the United States had avenged the Roberts attack
planned no more raids.
   ``We have completed these self-defense actions and consider this
incident closed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hidden President Says Noriega May Want U.S. Invasion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo
Delvalle said in an interview broadcast Saturday that military
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega ``is not sound of mind'' and may
want a U.S. invasion of his country.
   ``Maybe he believes that (an invasion) will be an honorable way
out,'' Delvalle said in a videotaped interview on Cable News
Network's ``Newsmaker Saturday.'' The network said the interview
was taped Monday at an undisclosed location in Panama.
   ``He doesn't know what he wants. He just want to hold off and
prove that he can hold off an American invasion. ... Noriega is not
sound of mind,'' said Delvalle, who called for either a Panamanian
military uprising or an international military force to oust
Noriega.
   Delvalle, who tried to fire Noriega as military commander two
months ago and then was ousted himself by Panama's
Noriega-controlled legislature, said he would remain in the
country. He said he has been staying in the houses of six different
Panamanian families.
   But Delvalle, who is recognized as Panama's president by the
U.S. government, acknowledged little support in the streets of
Panama for toppling Noriega and called for people to sacrifice.
   ``We are sinking the ship to grab the captain,'' he said. ``We
know that.''
   Delvalle said Panamanians have not risen up against Noriega
because they are afraid of him.
   ``They're terrorized. They've got beaten. They don't dare go out
to the streets and protest,'' he said.
   Delvalle said Noriega, who is accused in U.S. courts of drug
trafficking, is backed by Cubans, Nicaraguans, the Colombia-based
Medellin drug cartel and other Panamanian military officers who
will have to be kicked out with him.
   The president-in-hiding said he doubted that Noriega would wage
a guerrilla war if he is finally forced out of office, because he
hasn't got that kind of support and ``I think he's too rich to do
any of that type of foolish action.''
   U.S. officials allege that Noriega has made millions of dollars
by supporting illegal drug operations.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas battling the
U.S.-backed government said Saturday they will prevent newly
elected mayors from taking office and cited their recent
assassination of one mayor.
   A message broadcast by the rebels' Radio Venceremos began with
``A call to all mayors'' in which the guerrillas said: ``The FMLN
will not permit you to exercise your functions.
   ``We warn that mayors will have to resign their posts or abandon
their towns. We will be strict in enforcing this measure,'' the
radio said.
   The FMLN is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, an
alliance of five guerrilla groups waging an 8-year-old campaign
against U.S.-backed forces.
   The radio referred to the April 15 slaying by guerrillas of
Pedro Ventura, mayor-elect of the eastern town of San Isidro.
   It said he was killed ``because he refused to withdraw. He had
been warned.''
   Ventura represented the rightist party Arena, which won
two-thirds of the country's 262 mayoralties in March 20 legislative
and municipal elections.
   The threat came a day after the Supreme Court admitted a writ
filed by Arena, charging the incumbent Christian Democrats with
fraud in counting votes for national legislators from the eastern
province of La Union.
   The court did not say when it would rule definitively. But it
suspended certification of the disputed legislator from the
province, which means Arena will have an outright majority when the
new Legislative Assembly is installed May 1.
   Arena has 30 seats assured in the 60-seat legislature, which
because of the suspension will have only 59 members until the La
Union case is resolved.
   The count disputed by Arena gave two of La Union's three
legislators to the Christian Democrats. Arena claims it won two of
the three.
   The disputed count gave Arena a total of 30 deputies, the
Christian Democrats 23 and the National Conciliation Party seven.
   But until the case is resolved, the Christian Democrats, who
have formed an informal alliance with the Conciliation Party, will
have 22 seats.
   An Arena-controlled legislature is expected to make President
Jose Napoleon Duarte's last year in office an uphill struggle.
Duarte is a Christian Democrat.

<TEXT>
   The last known letter written by
Adolf Hitler's wife, Eva Braun, was auctioned Saturday for $8,000.
   Braun's last passport was also auctioned for $8,000, an oil
portrait of her sold for $3,500 and small items of jewelry brought
another $3,000, according to officials at Munich's Hermann
Historica Auction House.
   The auction house declined to identify any of the buyers, citing
company policy.
   A spokesman for the Munich auction house said bidding for both
the letter and the passport opened at $2,900 on Saturday and was
not expected to rise dramatically.
   There were no bids for a book of speeches from Rudolf Hess, the
one-time deputy to Nazi leader Hitler.
   Braun was Hitler's girlfriend for years. She and the Nazi
dictator were married not long before the two took their lives in
Hitler's underground bunker in Berlin, as advancing Russian troops
closed in on the area.
   Braun wrote what was believed to be her final letter, to her
sister, on April 23, 1945, just seven days before she and Hitler
committed suicide.
   In the letter she wrote: ``Our end can come at any day and any
hour now. Even the Fuehrer himself has lost hope of a happy ending
for us.''

<TEXT>
   French negotiators seeking to free three
countrymen held by pro-Iranian extremists flew away empty-handed
Saturday after last-minute hitches.
   The deal to free the hostages fell through because the
kidnappers made last-minute demands that the French negotiators
could not meet, according to Syrian and Lebanese officials at
Beirut Airport. Lebanese press reports said French officials had
refused to pay ransom to the kidnappers.
   The government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac has been trying
to free the three men before the first round of French presidential
elections on Sunday. Such a release could boost the chances of
Chirac, who is favored to oppose President Francois Mitterrand in
the final round of voting May 8.
   A chartered Swiss executive jet carrying the four French
negotiators left Beirut Saturday for an unknown destination,
according to Beirut airport officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Radio monitors in Cyprus reported they heard the pilot
say he was heading for Paris.
   The arrival of the 12-seat Falcon 50 in Beirut from Larnaca,
Cyprus, two hours earlier prompted speculation the release of the
three Frenchmen was imminent and that the jet had come to pick them
up.
   After a similar shuttle Friday, the plane's pilot, who would not
give his name, told reporters at Larnaca Airport: ``We went to get
the hostages, but there were no hostages ready.''
   The three hostages are diplomats Marcel Fontaine and Marcel
Carton and journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann. Fontaine and Carton were
kidnapped separately March 22, 1985, and Kauffmann was seized later
that year on May 22.
   A fourth Frenchman, Michel Seurat, a scientific researcher, was
kidnapped with Kauffmann on May 22, 1985. Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
holy war, which has claimed the abduction of all four, said on
March 5, 1986, it had killed Seurat. Seurat's wife, Marie, says
French officials have confirmed her husband died in captivity.
   Syrian and Lebanese officials said Friday the release of the
three other Frenchmen was expected within hours. Dozens of
journalists rushed to a night-long vigil at the Summerland Hotel in
Beirut, where two other French hostages were freed Nov. 27.
   Voice of Lebanon Christian-run radio said a French negotiator
transmitted a new kidnappers' demand, which it did not detail, to
Paris Friday evening. However, the station reported that the French
government was divided and gave no answer.
   The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper, based in Christian east
Beirut, said the kidnappers were demanding $28 million. It said
Mitterrand opposed the ransom, although it would be paid by French
and Arab businessmen.
   The other French hostages, Roger Auque and Jean-Louis Normandin,
were freed in exchange for a French payment of $330 million on a $1
billion loan owned to Tehran. It was made by the late Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi and frozen by the French after the 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran.
   The April 5 hijack of a Kuwait Airways jetliner by Shiite
extremists also apparently delayed the release of Carton, Fontaine
and Kauffmann, intelligence sources have said.
   In addition to the French captives, 18 other foreigners are
missing in Beirut. They are nine Americans, three Britons, a West
German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified
foreign men.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, The Associated
Press' chief Middle East correspondent, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Underground Preacher Reportedly Arrested Trying to See Billy
Graham</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An underground preacher who spreads Christian
gospel in China was arrested in a Beijing park after he came to
hear U.S. evangelist Billy Graham, a religious rights activist said
Saturday.
   Xu Yongzhe, from China's central Henan province, was detained
April 16, one day before Graham preached to more than 1,500 people
in a Beijing church, said Jonathan Chao, director of the Chinese
Church Research Center.
   Graham was in Shanghai on Saturday as part of his two-week tour
of China and could not immediately be reached for comment.
   Chao described Xu as an itinerant evangelist who trains his
followers to conduct preaching services and establish new
non-denominational churches.
   Since 1980, Xu's team of evangelists has established more than
3,000 local churches that are loosely associated, Chao said. His
claim could not be independently verified.
   Chao's center is known in Hong Kong for having critical views of
the Chinese government.
   China permits freedom of religion but religious activity is
closely monitored by the state. Proselytizing to the general public
is banned, but preaching in the state churches is allowed.
   There are 4,000 state-sanctioned churches in China. The official
Patriotic Catholic Church, which split with the Vatican in the
1950s, claims more than 3 million members throughout China. An
unknown number of other Chinese remain loyal to the pope.
   China also says it has several million Protestants.
   Xu worked outside the state-sanctioned churches because if he
worked with the state he would have been ``forbidden to expand the
Christian faith by preaching,'' Chao said.
   Chao said Xu was arrested in 1982 for preaching and was put in a
detention center for several years.
   Xu has since worked clandestinely in the countryside of central
China spreading the gospel, Chao claimed.
   Chao said he was informed of Xu's arrest in a letter dated April
20 from reliable Christian sources inside China. There was no way
to independently confirm the information and authorities in Beijing
were unavailable for comment this afternoon.
   According to the four-page letter, Xu told a friend in Beijing
that he would come to the capital to see Graham. Chao believes the
letter was intercepted by authorities.
   Xu arrived in Beijing on April 13 and was arrested three days
later while walking in Yuetan park with friends, the letter says.
   ``He was arrested because he wanted to hear Billy Graham
preach,'' said Chao.
   Chao said he had no further updates on Xu's situation.
   Chao said his center publishes a weekly news report and a
monthly magazine about religion in China. He described himself as
being critical of the religious policies of China which he said
persecutes itinerant preachers.

   Street clashes between members of
rival parties left dozens injured Saturday, and police guarded
scores of rallies leading up to this week's elections, police and
newspapers reported.
   A neighborhood leader in Seoul died Saturday after he was
injured in a fight Friday over how to distribute gift towels from a
governing party candidate to voters, one newspaper reported.
   Opposition politicians said the case showed irregular campaign
methods by the Democratic Justice Party.
   Major local newspapers said their surveys indicated the
governing Democratic Justice Party was likely to win a majority
Tuesday in the 299-seat National Assembly. That would strengthen
the position of President Roh Tae-woo, who won office in December
with just 36 percent of the vote.
   Police said ``all available police forces'' were mobilized to
watch 148 campaign rallies Saturday. The Korean news agency,
Yonhap, reported the rallies were largely peaceful because of the
heavy security.
   At some rallies, police in full riot gear lined up three or four
deep along one side of the podium.
   A dozen people were injured overnight when students armed with
firebombs attacked a governing party office in the southern city of
Chonju and a nearby police station.
   In the central city of Taejon, a campaign minibus covered with
opposition party posters was set on fire overnight, and gangs
attacked opposition party supporters in some rural areas on
Saturday.
   Once again, the opposition is split and the surveys showed
governing party candidates leading for more than 90 of the seats
being decided in 224 districts. Seventy-five other seats are being
decided by nationwide vote proportions, with the leading party
predicted to win 38 of them.
   The last assembly had 276 seats, with 160 held by the Democratic
Justice Party.
   In Tuesday's voting, 1,045 candidates are competing for the 224
district seats. The winners will serve for four years, compared
with a five-year term for the president, who is limited to one term.
   In a news conference Saturday, opposition leader Kim Young-sam
contended that ``our country will enter a gloomy period if the
ruling party, controlled by tycoons, generals and corrupt
bureaucrats, wins a majority.''
   Rival opposition leader Kim Dae-jung warned that the Roh
government would face popular outbursts if it continued the
allegedly improper campaigning.
   In December, both Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam insisted on
running for president, splitting the opposition vote.
   Under a new constitution that took effect in February, the
assembly has greater powers to investigate government actions, and
the president no longer can dissolve the legislature.

   French voters enjoyed a lull Saturday on the eve of
elections expected to determine who eventually faces off with
President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist acting like a social
institution these days.
   Since the hectic two-week official campaign ended Friday, the
silence has been resounding. No media appearances or campaigning
were allowed on Saturday.
   Even the political grease of voter surveys had run dry. French
law prohibits polls in the week before the elections.
   Even so, voters had plenty to spin their wheels over.
   The confrontation marks the first time in the 30 years of the
Fifth Republic that a president and his own premier have faced one
another in a presidential election.
   All polls predict that Mitterrand, the 71-year-old president
seeking a second seven-year term, will square off in the May 8
runoff with Chirac, France's 55-year-old conservative premier.
   They have ``cohabitated,'' as the French put it, since the
right's victory in parliamentary elections in 1986.
   The main interest in Sunday's voting, then, was reduced to
numbers:
   _ What percentage will Mitterrand win? Will he be able to pick
up enough Communist and centrist votes to expand the 35-37 percent
the polls give him?
   _ What will be the combined totals of Chirac, predicted to gain
22-24 percent, and former center-right premier Raymond Barre, 16-17
percent? That number could give a good idea whether anyone can beat
Mitterrand in the final round of voting.
   Besides Chirac, 68-year-old Barre is the only other candidate
with a whisper of a chance to make it to the runoff. He was long
the top rightist candidate before nose-diving in the polls in the
past two months.
   Barre has said he can't be counted out now. But he pledges to
support Chirac if the premier comes out ahead in first-round
voting. Chirac has vowed to do the same.
   Much also depends on backers of extreme right National Front
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen's strident anti-immigration and
``French first'' appeal has won over an estimated 10-12 percent of
the electorate in an otherwise lackluster campaign.
   Actually, voters will choose from nine candidates Sunday.
Theoretically, it is possible to elect a president in the first
round, but the large number of candidates means that no one can
expect to win the required absolute majority of votes.
   Other candidates in the race are Andre Lajoinie, the official
Communist Party candidate; Pierre Juquin, leader of a splinter
Communist reformist movement; ecologist Antoine Waechter;
Trotskyist Arlette Laguiller; and another Trotskyist, Pierre
Boussel.
   The polls predict Mitterrand will win the runoff no matter who
he faces. He has reshaped his image toward the center in recent
months and has even been dubbed by the French with the avuncular
nickname of ``Tonton.''
   But Chirac was closing the gap when the final surveys were
published a week ago. Moreoever, the undecided vote was high, as
much as 20 percent.
   Many political analysts say Mitterrand must get 35 percent in
the first round in order to win May 8.
   On the right, it was generally thought that the combined
Chirac-Barre vote must total at least 43 percent to give
conservatives a chance in the runoff.
   However, many of Barre's more centrist supporters may abandon
Chirac in the second round.
   The polls open 8 a.m. Sunday and close in most areas at 6 p.m.
In major urban areas, however, they remain open until 8 p.m.
   None of the candidates has come out with a detailed program,
focusing instead on generalities. In his last television speech,
Mitterrand stressed the need for ``solidarity, equality of
opportunity'' and the ``refusal of privileges'' for some people.
   Chirac has responded by accusing Mitterrand of ``proposing
nothing precise for our country.'' He stands on his two-year record
as head of the government, which he says started the country on the
road back to prosperity.

   Twenty-five years of romance, turmoil,
romance, treachery, romance, mystery and more romance were toasted
by past and present stars of ``General Hospital'' at a black-tie
gala befitting the top-rated daytime drama.
   The ABC soap, which debuted April 1, 1963, placed No. 1 again in
the most recent Nielsen ratings, but one of its original stars,
speaking at Friday night's party at the Ambassador Hotel, recalled
its humble beginnings.
   ``When we started, I didn't think we were going to last 25
minutes let alone 25 years. It was very iffy,'' said Emily
McLaughlin, who as nurse Jessie Brewer is one of two original cast
members still with the show. ``We hit No. 1 in 1968, and then we
went down so far we were almost canceled.''
   ``We had a wonderful time,'' recalled actor Jack Betts, who was
on ``General Hospital'' during its first three years. ``(Actor)
Johnny Beradino had been a ball player and had never done a soap
before. Nor had I. We never thought it would last, and John kept
saying he'd have to go back and play baseball again.''
   Betts' character was written out of the show when he was sent to
South America to do medical research and never came back.
   ``General Hospital'' has been consistently first in the daytime
ratings, although it's locked in a tight race with CBS' ``The Young
and the Restless.'' The show has been a huge success throughout the
1980s.
   Nevertheless, ``General Hospital'' was on the brink of
cancellation 10 years ago, before Gloria Monty became executive
producer and turned the show around.
   The show became a pop phenomenon, led by anti-hero Luke and the
headstrong Laura, a tainted Romeo and Juliet involved in murder,
rape and other shady activities. Their wedding in 1981 sent the
ratings jumping off the chart, with Elizabeth Taylor as a guest
star for the wedding sequence.
   Although Tony Geary and Genie Francis, who played the lovers,
have left, there are enough plot twists and offbeat characters to
keep the audience happy.
   Gloria Monty has also left and been replaced by Wes Kenney.
   Beradino, as Dr. Steve Hardy, and Ms. McLaughlin have been with
the show since the beginning. Rachel Ames as the oft-married Audrey
Hardy, who finally settled down with her longtime love, joined soon
afterward.
   Former stars include actors who built careers on prime time,
like John Stamos, David Groh, Daniel J. Travanti, Emma Samms,
Richard Dean Anderson and Douglas Sheehan, as well as film stars
Mark Hamill and Demi Moore. TV personalities Mary Ann Mobley and
Richard Simmons also have appeared on the show.
   Besides Taylor, guest stars have included Milton Berle, Sammy
Davis Jr., June Lockhart, Shaun Cassidy, and three members of
baseball's New York Mets, Howard Johnson, Roger McDowell and Clint
Hurdle.

<TEXT>
   Two murder cases, one of them 20 years
old, have been closed with the conviction of a man police
considered a suspect from the beginning and whose arrest was
sparked by a national television program.
   To the women who knew him, Robert Weeks was a Clark Gable
lookalike. But authorities say he was a man whose jealous rages led
to the deaths of two women and most likely a third.
   Weeks was convicted Friday in the 1968 murder of his ex-wife and
the 1980 murder of a former girlfriend. The jury recommended that
he spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of
parole.
   ``I believe Bob Weeks is finally history,'' said deputy district
attorney Mel Harmon.
   Authorities had considered him the prime suspect in the killing
of his ex-wife, Patricia Weeks, right from the beginning. He also
was convicted in the killing of Cynthia Jabour, and police believe
he also killed a San Diego woman, Carol Ann Riley.
   All three women vanished after agreeing to meet Weeks for
dinner. All three had told him just before they disappeared that
they were ending their relationship with him.
   Ironically, it was Weeks' latest girlfriend, a Tucson, Ariz.,
free-lance writer, who turned him in last year after seeing the
television program ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and recognizing Weeks as
the man suspected of killing the women.
   None of the bodies was ever found, forcing prosecutors to put
together a painstaking case of circumstantial evidence.
   ``Generally in a murder case you've got a body and you put on a
medical examiner and he explains the cause of death,'' said Harmon.
``We didn't have a body so we couldn't do that.''
   Instead, Harmon put on members of the victims' families, former
neighbors, doctors, anyone he could find with a connection to the
victims and Weeks. In all, 52 witnesses were called during a
3-week-long trial.
   Many of the witnesses remembered Weeks as very much a ladies'
man, with a pencil-thin mustache and dark hair that made him
resemble Clark Gable.
   ``We had to put on a whole lot of people so we could make it
crystal clear that these disappearances couldn't be voluntary,''
said Harmon.
   Relatives testified that Mrs. Weeks would never have voluntarily
left her four young children.
   A friend testified of seeing Mrs. Weeks for the last time when
she got a threatening phone call from Weeks 15 days after their
divorce. The friend said he confronted Weeks after the woman's
disappearance and that Weeks matter-of-factly replied, ``She either
had a nervous breakdown or is probably dead.''
   A doctor testified about treating Mrs. Weeks several times for
bruises that she suffered at Weeks' hands.
   A friend of Miss Jabour testified that the real estate broker
would never have gone off without her valued clothes or a $47,000
securities account.
   And the father of Miss Riley recalled his daughter telling him
she owed Weeks one last dinner, at which she was going to tell him
of her engagement to a Colorado doctor.
   ``The real challenging part of the case was Patricia Weeks,''
said Harmon. ``We had to go back years with family members who have
done their best to block out the memory. And the other people just
didn't care that much about it.''
   Harmon has a theory about the fate of the victims.
   ``This fellow had a lot of interest in mining, he knew where
mineshafts were,'' the prosecutor said. ``If we knew where these
mineshafts were I think we'd find the remains of Patricia Weeks and
Cynthia Jabour.''

   Emotions boiled over with violence as vendors
failed to stop state lawmakers from selecting the place where the
vendors work as the site for a convention center.
   Several scuffles broke out as about 100 vendors, mostly
immigrants from Korea, surged from a Capitol meeting room, trying
to confront the lawmakers who were quickly escorted out by security
officers.
   Ten Honolulu police officers were dispatched to help a dozen
security officers quiet the crowd in the Capitol late Friday night.
   One Korean woman collapsed, apparently from emotion.
   ``No, No, No,'' went up the shouts as Senate Transportation
Committee Chairman Milton Holt and House Tourism Committee Chairman
Romy Cachola announced agreement on the International Market Place
in Waikiki as site for the convention center.
   Some called the lawmakers ``traitors,'' while others made death
threats. Women wailed and sobbed uncontrollably as others grabbed
and restrained several young men who attempted to chase the
lawmakers.
   Tension had been building throughout the evening as the House
and Senate conferees exchanged proposals and then recessed for
lengthy periods.
   Vendors have been staging rallies at the Capitol since February
and have attended every hearing to testify on the convention center
issue.
   ``I've been here 18 years and we've had all kinds of people here
as lobbyists, but this is the first time I went through this kind
of experience,'' said House Speaker Daniel Kihano.
   ``I just hope they (vendors) understand that the people who
intend to develop the market place are putting up a lot of money to
take care of their problems, to relocate them,'' said Kihano.
   Won Hee You, who has served as a spokeswoman for the 900
vendors, said they fear the convention center will wipe out years
of work to establish their businesses.
   The measure will allow a private developer to exceed the city's
280-foot height limit on the five-acre parcel and put up three
400-foot hotel and condominium towers.
   In exchange for the additional height, the developer has agreed
to build a 625,000 square-foot convention center facility which
would be turned over to the state. Such a facility would cost the
state $150 million to $200 million to build, according to Cachola.

   Israel's security and intelligence services have
become among the world's most efficient. Years ago there was the
successful raid on the Entebbe airport, then the destruction of the
Iraqi nuclear installation, and now, from all accounts, the
assassination of the No. 2 man in the PLO organization. Here is a
look at the fabled institutions.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   When an assassination team gunned down the
PLO's No. 2 man at his villa in Tunisia, it was widely accepted as
another daring action by the long arm of Israel's fabled security
and intelligence services.
   The slaying of Khalil Wazir 1,500 miles from Israel on April 16
bore the fingerprints of the Mossad, the agency responsible for
activities outside Israel's borders. By all accounts it was quick,
decisive, carried out with split-second timing and backed by
Israel's air and naval forces.
   Israel's intelligence has been able to gather precise
information on locations of homes or installations and the
movements of bodyguards. Teams have been able to make pinpoint
attacks and often escape without detection.
   Although Israeli officials declined public comment, Israeli
sources privately acknowledged the killing was planned by the
agency, approved by the government and carried out by elite Israeli
commandos. Tunisia accused Israel of carrying out the assassination.
   Israel's intelligence services have planted an agent in Syria,
found and kidnapped Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann from Argentina
in 1960, participated in the dramatic rescue of Israeli hostages
held at Entebbe Airport in Uganda in 1976 and the bombing of Iraq's
nuclear reactor in 1981.
   The Mossad has earned a reputation for carrying out imaginative,
high-risk operations to rescue Israeli captives or punish those
believed responsible for planning and carrying out attacks against
Israelis.
   ``Because of our special circumstances _ namely we are poor,
small and surrounded by belligerent countries _ the Israeli
intelligence is of utmost importance,'' said Meir Amit, head of the
Mossad from 1963 to 1968. ``We have to have ears and eyes beyond
our borders.''
   ``If you can bang in the nail in one hit instead of two, you
save money and energy. But to do that, you have to know where the
head of the nail is,'' Amit told The Associated Press. ``That's
where the Mossad comes in.''
   Despite some public failures, Israeli intelligence has been
effective, and the Wazir operation fits the pattern.
   Wazir, 52, also known as Abu Jihad, was deputy to Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat and head of the PLO's
military operations.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted Italian military officials,
who it did not identify, as saying a Boeing 707 reportedly involved
in the raid may have passed through international air space under
direction of Italian air traffic controllers.
   Italy's air traffic control center confirmed to The AP that it
tracked an Israeli plane identifying itself as a civilian aircraft
shortly before the commando attack at Wazir's house on the
outskirts of Tunis.
   Israelis say Wazir organized a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35
Israelis were killed and a Tel Aviv hotel takeover in 1975 in which
11 hostages were slain.
   More recently, Israelis contend he was the mastermind behind
nearly five months of Arab unrest as well as two successful
guerrilla infiltrations in which nine Israelis were killed.
   Founded in 1951, the agency is responsible for covert activities
outside the country, as is the CIA. Unlike the CIA, however, the
Israeli organization is so secret that Israeli law bars publishing
the name of the current Mossad chief. The agency is viewed as key
to Israel's survival.
   The agency is helped by the fact that Israel, because it is a
nation of emigrants, has among its ranks Jews born in Arab
countries who speak Arabic and can easily fit into enemy
environments.
   Eli Cohen, the legendary Israeli spy who developed close
friendships with Syrian government and military leaders, is a
classic example.
   The Egyptian-born Cohen, posing as an Arab, provided Israel with
critical information from 1960 until 1965, when he was unmasked,
tortured and hanged by the Syrians.
   In addition, many Jews who do not live in Israel feel a sense of
loyalty to the Jewish state.
   In 1966, the Mossad used an American woman to persuade an Iraqi
fighter pilot to defect to Israel with his Soviet-built MiG-21
fighter sought by Israeli military intelligence.
   Mossad agents also were led to Eichmann by a tip from a German
official who was Jewish.
   Although few details have yet emerged, the Wazir killing appears
to bear the most similarity to the 1973 raid on PLO offices in
Beirut in which three top PLO officials, including Wazir's
predecessor Kamel Adwan, were killed.
   As in the Wazir killing, that operation involved seaborne
commandos who managed to carry out the killings on enemy territory
despite the presence of armed guards.
   The leader of that earlier raid was Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, now
the head of military intelligence who reportedly helped organize
the Wazir killing.
   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, Israel's deputy chief of staff, planned
the 1973 raid. According to Israeli sources, Barak was the officer
who personally saw off the commandos who went to Tunis to gun down
Wazir.
   Israel also had experience making the long trip to Tunis over
the Mediterranean Sea. In 1985 Israel bombed PLO headquarters in
Tunis, reportedly killing 50 people including an Arafat bodyguard.
   There have been some failures. The Mossad was criticized for
failing to adequately warn Israeli leaders of an Arab military
build-up prior to the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
   In addition, Israeli agents killed the wrong man in July 1973 in
their hunt for an Arab guerrilla in Lillehammer, Norway. The 1972
Ben-Gurion Airport massacre, in which Japanese Red Army guerrillas
killed 26 people and wounded 72 in the Israeli passenger terminal,
was a serious security lapse.
   Wazir's killing was approved by key government ministers,
according to Israeli sources.
   But two, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Ezer Weizman, a
Cabinet minister without portfolio, publicly expressed displeasure
with the assassination, fearing it could kill U.S.-backed peace
efforts and fuel greater Arab extremism.
   ``At the very time that Israeli leaders are primarily concerned
with calming the territories, the elimination of Abu Jihad is like
tossing an enormous amount of fuel on the flames,'' wrote the daily
Hadashot.
   ``Moreover, if the PLO leaders are to be eliminated, with whom
then do we intend to discuss the issue of settling the Palestinian
problem?''
   Many Israelis, however, feel Wazir's assassination provided some
long-awaited good news.
   ``Whether or not Israel did it, there is no question that we had
not only the right, but the obligation to kill people like Abu
Jihad,'' said Uzi Landau, a legislator from the right-wing Likud
bloc. ``Such a success in our fight against terrorism cannot help
but be met here with praise and enthusiasm.''

   A pregnant woman shopping at a video store
with her children was shot to death before their eyes during a
holdup, but the unborn child she carried was alive Saturday
following a Caesarean section delivery.
   A gunman who apparently was irate at the small amount of money
in the cash register shot Anna Holmes at the base of the skull as
he walked out of the store, police said.
   ``He was demanding more money. The clerk was saying, `There
isn't any more money.' At that point, he turned around and shot
her,'' said Lt. Bernard Bailey of the Salt Lake County Sheriff's
Office.
   He said the gunman pulled the trigger with the comment,
``That'll take care of her.''
   No one else was hurt, authorities said.
   Mrs. Holmes, 31, of West Valley City, died about 30 minutes
after the unprovoked shooting at the Voyager Video store, where she
was shopping with her three children.
   An infant girl, a few weeks short of full-term, was delivered
minutes before Mrs. Holmes' death at the University of Utah Health
Sciences Center. She remained in critical condition Saturday, a
nursing supervisor said.
   Witnesses told police the man fled in a large, older model car,
although no one actually saw him get into it.
   The amount of cash taken in the robbery was undetermined.
   In addition to the victim's children, whose ages ranged from 5
to 13, and the clerk, about eight other people witnessed the
shooting.

   Israeli troops enforced a tight curfew Saturday
on 400,000 Arabs during a ``Day of Rage'' ordered by Palestinian
leaders. An Israeli policeman shot and killed a Palestinian man who
attacked him with an ax.
   The curfew, confining Palestinians in the occupied territories
to their homes, was maintained for a sixth straight day following
violent protests over the assassination of PLO military leader
Khalil Wazir.
   Two Palestinians were shot to death by Israeli troops during the
protests Friday in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
   A paramilitary border policeman shot and killed a Palestinian
man who attacked him with an ax during a protest in the West Bank
village of Qabatiya, the army said without identifying the dead man.
   Arab reports said the demonstration in the village 43 miles
north of Jerusalem was to protest Wazir's slaying. The army said
dozens of Palestinians participated.
   In Bethlehem, some 200 youths, many masking their faces with
their Arab headdresses, hurled rocks at troops in the Aida refugee
camp.
   An Associated Press reporter saw soldiers fire tear gas and
rubber bullets at the protesters. Witnesses said a 7-year-old Arab
boy was injured by rubber bullets and nine residents suffered from
tear gas inhalation.
   In the Gaza Strip's Maghazi refugee camp, troops arrested two
Arabs after a firebomb was thrown at an army patrol, Israel radio
said. No injuries were reported.
   The death on Saturday brought to 172 the number of Arabs killed
since the uprising began 19 weeks ago. An Israeli teen-ager and an
army soldier also have perished.
   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising had called for a
``Day of Rage'' in the occupied territories Saturday to mark a week
since Wazir's death.
   In Gaza City, burning tires filled the air with smoke. Most
shops were closed in response to a call for a general strike. But
vendors sold fruits, vegetables and other goods from carts on the
streets.
   The army curfew Saturday covered the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank towns of Anabta and Nablus, population 100,000, along with 20
refugee camps in the former Jordanian territory.
   The army said it would lift on Sunday a four-day-old ban on
travel to Israel by residents of the occupied lands.
   Israeli leaders had predicted that the uprising against Israel's
21-year occupation would falter both because of strong army action
and economic strains on the Palestinians caused by repeated general
strikes.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel's 40th anniversary
Thursday that he believed violence would end soon in the occupied
territories.
   An Israeli scholar said Saturday, however, that Wazir's
assassination, which has been blamed on Israel, could prompt more
bloodshed.
   ``We may see more terrorist operations not only against Israeli
targets in Israel itself,'' Asher Sasser of Tel Aviv University
told Israel Radio. ``There may be more terrorist operations against
Israeli objectives in Europe which Fatah at least has abstained
from for quite a few years.''
   Sasser, a terrorism expert, said that the PLO's mainstream Fatah
group may see the killing of Wazir ``as a change of the rules in
the war with Israel, that they would now be able to justify
operations against Israeli targets in Europe.''
   Wazir, a close associate of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, was slain
at his home in Tunis, Tunisia, on April 16. Tunisian authorities
and informed Israeli sources have said the assassination was
carried out by Israeli commandos.
   Israeli officials have said that Wazir directed much of the
uprising in the occupied territories, but Sasser said he doubted
Wazir's death would cause either a sudden outburst of violence or
an end to the uprising.
   ``I think it should be recognized that the uprising in the West
Bank was not a PLO-organized phenomena,'' he said. ``Although the
PLO certainly supported and encouraged the uprising, it was not
totally controlled or initiated by the organization.''

<HEAD>Lord Ramsey, Former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dead At 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lord Ramsey, who as archbishop of Canterbury from
1961 to 1974 left his mark as a champion of Christian unity and
liberal causes, died Saturday at the age of 83.
   He had been ill with bronchial pneumonia for several weeks and
died at St. John's Home in Oxford, the Church of England said.
   During his 13 years as archbishop of Canterbury, Ramsey thrust
the state Church of England and the 70-million-member worldwide
Anglican Communion toward unity with the Roman Catholic church and
other Christian denominations, a goal yet to be achieved.
   He traveled the world attempting to heal centuries-old schisms
and was president of the World Council of Churches from 1961 to
1968.
   Ramsey took a liberal stand on a range of political and social
issues during the volatile era of his primacy.
   He denounced South African apartheid and British restrictions of
Asian immigration while advocating nuclear disarmament, abolition
of the death penalty and relaxation of laws opposing homosexuality,
divorce and abortion.
   He authored numerous theological works and held honorary
doctorates at several universities.
   In announcing his death, the Church of England called Ramsey
``one of the great archbishops of this century.''
   Robert Runcie, the current archbishop of Canterbury, said his
predecessor ``was courageous in social comment and led the church
steadily and confidently into new ways of worship and government.''
   Michael Ramsey was born Nov. 14, 1904, the son of a lecturer in
mathematics at Cambridge University. The future archbishop's
paternal grandfather was a Congregationalist minister and his
maternal grandfather was an Anglican clergyman.
   Educated at Cambridge University, he was a regarded as brilliant
debater. He was ordained in 1928 and became bishop of Durham in
1952. Four years later he became archbishop of York, the Church of
England's second-highest rank.
   At his installment as archbishop of Canterbury, Ramsey described
his task as ``to bring home to the people God Himself'' and his
objective ``the unity of Christians.''
   He was made a life peer on retirement, taking the title Lord
Ramsey of Canterbury.
   A funeral is to be held at Canterbury Cathedral and a memorial
service at London's Westminster Abbey. The dates have not been set.
   He is survived by his wife, Lady Ramsey. They were married in
1942 and had no children.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III travels
Monday to Detroit, a city unhappy with the time he's taking to make
a decision affecting thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in
newspaper revenues.
   At his office, the embattled attorney general faces a desk piled
high with other policy questions, ranging from an intramural
dispute between the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service to
initiatives on drugs, pornography, gun control and the death
penalty.
   Meese's chief spokesman, Terry Eastland, says ``the attorney
general has indicated to anyone that has asked him that he is
moving as quickly as possible to make decisions on issues that rise
to his level.''
   But congressional critics pressing for Meese's resignation
suggest the tangle of ethical questions over his conduct and
staffing problems at the Justice Department are hindering his
ability to tend to regular business.
   ``I don't know how decisions can be made in a timely way in the
environment that he faces, where senior staff has quit,'' said Sen.
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat whose Governmental Affairs
subcommittee has held extensive hearings into Meese's affairs.
   Detroit is focusing on Meese's statutory authority to decide
whether the city's two daily newspapers, the News and the Free
Press, will be allowed to merge their business and production
operations and share profits, a move they say is necessary to
ensure that both survive.
   ``We have been in this process for more than two years now, and
it is frankly a wearying, exhausting process, with everyone's
future on hold, and in fact with people not knowing if the
newspaper or they have a future,'' said David Lawrence, publisher
of the Free Press. The paper's owners, Knight-Ridder Inc., say the
Free Press will be closed if a joint operating agreement is
rejected.
   Meese, however, has said he will not discuss the newspaper
question when he speaks before the Economic Club of Detroit. His
subject will be drug control.
   On that front, Meese has shaped several recommendations which
now must be steered through Congress, including a law controlling
chemicals used to process cocaine. He also seeks authorization to
provide better weaponry to drug enforcement officials in source
countries.
   Meese also seeks death-penalty legislation for presidential
assassins and prisoners serving life sentences who kill guards,
laws to modify the requirement that improperly obtained evidence be
excluded in criminal cases, stricter controls on pornography and
obscenity, a ban on guns invisible to metal detectors and increased
funding for prison construction.
   Beyond broad issues, Meese also has several specific policy
decisions to make, such as a 9-month-old dispute between the FBI
and the Marshals Service over which should have authority to track
down fugitives.
   Meese this month testified before a grand jury in an
investigation of a $40,000-a-year job for his wife, Ursula; his
involvement with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline, his ownership of
$14,000 in telephone company stock and his ties to the
scandal-plagued Bronx defense contractor, Wedtech Corp.
   Two key Justice Department posts became vacant last month when
the second-ranking official in the department and the head of the
criminal division both resigned abruptly.
   In a meeting with President Reagan last Wednesday, one of the
two, Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, told Reagan, Vice
President George Bush, and other White House officials that
``Meese's behavior was hurting the Department of Justice,'' an
administration source said, speaking on condition he not be
identified by name.
   ``I don't know how morale could not be affected by the mass
resignations and by the continual problems that the attorney
general faces,'' the administration official said. But Reagan,
after a follow-up conversation with Meese, expressed continued
support for Meese.
   The attorney general has said he spends virtually all his time
during the work week to the business of the department, and a
substantial portion of the weekends.
   But Levin said: ``I doubt that that's totally true. I can't
believe that given the amount of time that he has spent in front of
grand juries and preparing for those visits, that all of that was
done after office hours.''
   Asked if Meese's legal and personnel problems had delayed the
Detroit ruling, Eastland said: ``I just don't see that.''
   The News, owned by Gannett Co. Inc., and the Free Press sought
the partial merger on May 9, 1986 under the Newspaper Preservation
Act, designed to preserve newspaper competition in cities where one
publication is in danger of failing.
   Knight-Ridder said in January the Free Press has had operating
losses of $100 million since 1979, and the News in the same period
had operating losses of about $75 million. The News is the nation's
ninth-largest newspaper; the Free Press, the 10th largest.

   Hard-core smokers fidgeted and chewed their fingernails, or
candy or gum, Saturday at the start of the smoking ban on domestic
airline flights of two hours or less, but non-smokers rejoiced and
even some smokers didn't mind.
   ``It's been well publicized, so people really aren't very
upset,'' said TWA ticket agent Vicki Sharpeta at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
   Well, most people weren't upset.
   ``Flying is already stressful enough, and now they're going to
make it worse if they won't let me smoke up there,'' said Lother
Straschnitzki of Sonoma, Calif., waiting for his flight to be
called at San Francisco International Airport. ``It's going to
bother me a lot.''
   The federal ban on smoking on domestic flights of less than two
hours went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday, affecting some
13,600 flights a day or about 80 percent of all domestic flights.
   There were no early reports of violations, which could bring a
fine of up to $1,000. Tampering with a lavatory smoke alarm in
order to sneak a smoke could bring a $2,000 fine.
   But there was confusion. Gloria Mitchell of Philadelphia
described a mixup on her two-hour, six-minute United flight to
Chicago: ``First they said we couldn't smoke and then half-way
though they said we could smoke. We all had a fit, and then lit up
all together.''
   ``We don't want to take away smokers' rights,'' Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., the ban's main Senate supporter, said at a news
conference Saturday at Newark International Airport. ``We're
pro-health.''
   ``We try to appeal to their sense of fairness,'' Lautenberg said
of hard-core smokers. ``There are some folks who are upset about
it, and I apologize to them for it.''
   He said he would seek to extend the smoking ban to all flights
after the new law is reviewed in two years.
   ``I'm thrilled. I'm so happy. I just can't breathe anymore on
these flights,'' United Airlines flight attendant Terry Cale said
in San Francisco. ``I'm afraid to go to the doctor to have my lungs
examined for fear of what they'll find.''
   ``The new rule is a good idea,'' said Elva Witler of Green
Valley, Ariz., at the Los Angeles airport, who began smoking at age
16 but gave it up in 1965. ``I have been on planes where the smell
just permeates the plane.''
   An Eastern representative boarding passengers on a flight from
Washington's National Airport to Boston apologized over the
intercom to smokers. Her ``I'm sorry'' was greeted with a
spontaneous ``We're not'' from about a dozen waiting passengers.
   Ahron Leichtman, national president of Citizens Against Tobacco
Smoke, said from his home at Boca Raton, Fla., that the ban gave
him ``a very positive, upbeat feeling.''
   Some airlines offered substitutes for cigarettes, including hard
candy and a chewing gum designed to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Dr.
Don R. Powell, executive director of the American Institute for
Preventive Medicine, advised smokers to put a rubber band around
the wrist of their smoking hand and snap it whenever a nicotine
urge struck.
   Some smokers joked about the change.
   ``I can last two hours without cigarettes,'' said Kim
Silberberg, awaiting a flight from Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport. ``I can bite my nails.''
   ``I survived,'' said Tom Brand of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., but he
lit up the moment he stepped off a plane at Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport.
   ``A smoker joked with me today about the smoking regulations,''
said USAir ticket agent Heather McDonald at Albany, N.Y. ``He said
one good thing about them is that he can sit up in the front of the
plane now and get off sooner. He said he won't have to be in the
back of the plane waiting for 20 minutes to get off.''
   And some smokers even favored the ban.
   ``I've been trying to quit,'' Anita Carol Irvin, 36, of
Cincinnati, said while waiting to board a flight home at Richmond
International Airport.
   ``The ban is a good thing. If you can't last two hours without a
cigarette, you need help,'' said David Mutz, a smoker waiting to
board a flight to San Francisco from Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
   ``It's fine with me,'' said Betty Lockhart of Lompoc, Calif.,
who described herself between puffs at Newark International Airport
as a lifetime smoker. ``You can stand on your head for an hour if
you have to.''
   ``They're forcing me to do something I've been procrastinating
about. So I'm keeping a positive attitude,'' said Bob Wynn, a
smoker from Highland Mills, N.Y., who hopes the ban helps him kick
the habit.

<HEAD>Robertson Wins His First Delegates Since Super Tuesday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson
picked up 14 delegates at the Nevada Republican Convention on
Saturday, his biggest one-day showing so far and his first delegate
gain since Super Tuesday.
   Vice President George Bush won four delegates and another two
were elected as uncommitted.
   The state convention was dominated by Robertson forces who
sought conciliation rather than confrontation with supporters of
Bush, the all but certain winner of the Republican presidential
nomination.
   Support for Bush at this point ``is very wise,'' Robertson said
at a news conference as the convention opened.
   Republican National Committee Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, who was
elected as an uncommitted delegate from his home state, said
Saturday he met briefly with Robertson to talk about holding
``unity meetings'' that will involve all the GOP presidential
candidates, and Robertson supported the plan.
   Fahrenkopf also said the Robertson supporters are vital to GOP
efforts this year, especially in Southern states that have been
solidly Democratic, and will be a boon because of their eagerness
``to get involved at the grass roots level.''
   Rich Bond, Bush's deputy campaign manager who also was at the
convention, said the Robertson backers ``can have a very beneficial
effect in the party if we all merge. And that's our desire.''
   But Bond also said some antipathy still exists between Bush
supporters and the Robertson camp because ``passions were high,
words were spoken'' earlier in the campaign.
   He added that the Bush camp is prepared to smooth over those
``rough spots'' and work with Robertson to ensure he has a voice in
the GOP. Robertson said he now wants to be a ``rallying point for
conservatives.''
   The overwhelming Robertson victory in Nevada included the
election of his Nevada campaign strategist, Steve Wark of Las
Vegas, as state GOP chairman.
   The Nevada convention boosted Robertson's national delegate
total to 31, while Bush now has 1,081 delegates to the Republican
National Convention, according to The Associated Press delegate
count.
   That put Bush just 58 delegates shy of the 1,139 needed to win
the GOP presidential nomination.
   While Robertson did well in Nevada, he said Republican unity is
what's needed now and that for him, the 1988 race was over.
   Robertson got repeated applause Friday when he addressed the
convention, which at times took on a church-revival atmosphere as
some delegates, their eyes closed and hands raised, prayed aloud.
   The convention, whose 600 delegates included more than 400
Robertson backers, also began singing ``God Bless America'' at the
end of Robertson's speech.
   Robertson, who has ceased active campaigning, marked his last
delegate gain on March 8, when he won five in Arkansas, two in
Massachusetts and two in Mississippi. He won another eight
delegates at a stormy state convention in Michigan in January.

   Friends, admirers and political allies of
Robert F. Kennedy, assassinated as he sought the presidency 20
years ago, were reunited Saturday at a conference to remember the
senator and seek lessons from his life.
   ``R.F.K. Remembered'' is ``partially a reunion but also, and
more significantly, a reaffirmation and rededication ... to the
purposes for which Robert Kennedy lived and died,'' historian
Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. told the Loyola Marymount University
audience, setting the theme for the conference.
   Schlesinger, who served as an adviser to Kennedy's slain
brother, President John F. Kennedy, received a standing ovation
from a packed auditorium of onetime Kennedy supporters, friends and
classes of youngsters who came to learn about the candidate they
never knew.
   One of Kennedy's 11 children, lawyer Kathleen Kennedy Townsend,
also was to speak. Other participants included Kennedy's former
press secretary, Frank Mankiewicz, former Kennedy aide Edwin
Guthman, United Farm Workers President Cesar Chavez, former Carter
administration aide Midge Costanza and California Assemblyman Tom
Hayden.
   ``Twenty years ago this month many of us were working our heads
and hearts out to make Robert Kennedy president of the United
States,'' Schlesinger said. ``No one can tell where roads not taken
would have led.''
   But Schlesinger said he believed that Kennedy would have ended
the Vietnam War, slowed the nuclear arms race and provided new
opportunities for the poor and dispossessed.
   ``A Robert Kennedy presidency would have delivered the public
from Watergate with its attendant perversions of the
Constitution,'' Schlesinger said.
   In an address which had political overtones for this year's
presidential primaries, the scholar and author of many political
books said he believed American society was about to rouse itself
from the conservative Reagan years and move into a liberal
political future.
   ``Reaganism is finished, bankrupt, used up, played out,'' he
said to a loud round of applause. ``At last, it is truly bedtime
for Bonzo.''
   The day's gathering began with the showing of a film documenting
Robert Kennedy's life and his role in his brother's administration.
   Paul Schrade, the one-time Kennedy campaign organizer who was
shot with Kennedy but survived, billed the conference as focusing
on the legacy of ``a victory of life over death.''
   Kennedy was gunned down in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel
on June 5, 1968, moments after he claimed victory in the California
Democratic presidential primary. Sirhan Sirhan, a Jordanian
immigrant, was convicted of the killing and is serving a life term
at Soledad Prison.
   Questions have been raised over the years concerning a possible
second gun being fired at Kennedy. Last week's release of police
files in the nearly 20-year-old case has focused attention on
conspiracy theories and the circumstances surrounding Kennedy's
death.
   Schrade, who organized the conference, was chagrined at the
timing of the release of files he had sought for years.
   ``I thought it was monstrous bad timing by (Secretary of State)
March Fong Eu,'' he said, noting he had asked her to postpone the
release until the conference was over.
   Schrade said the release focused attention again on Kennedy's
death while the conference was meant to shift that focus to his
life.
   ``All of the pain and grief had buried a lot of the legacy,'' he
said.
   ``Bob was the best political candidate I've known in 40 years in
politics,'' said Schrade. ``He was committed to real social change,
to ending the war in Vietnam. He was committed to working for the
underclass in this country.''
   During a panel discussion, Hayden, a leader of the 1968 riots at
the Chicago Democratic Convention, said he believed that the
violence at the convention would not have occurred had Kennedy been
the candidate.
   ``That would have been a convention without chaos,'' Hayden
said, ``because Robert Kennedy could work with (Mayor) Richard
Daley. Anyone who could work with Tom Hayden and Richard Daley was
quite a fellow.''
   Among spectators at the conference was former California Gov.
Jerry Brown, who said he came because Schrade was his next-door
neighbor but also because he found inspiration in the principles
Kennedy pursued.
   ``He had such a clarity about what was right and what was
wrong,'' said Brown. ``He just went out and tried to change
things.''
   Brown declined comment on his own political future or on the
contents of the book he is writing about his life in politics.

   Supporters joined in singing ``We
Shall Overcome'' and offered advice Saturday to minority students
who occupied a building at Williams College for a second day to
protest racial policies at the school.
   Parents' Weekend is under way at the 2,000-student liberal-arts
college.
   An afternoon rally outside Jenness House, where the occupation
was taking place, drew about 80 people including parents and
faculty. The crowd, predominately white, sang the civil rights
movement anthem and listened to about 40 minutes of speeches by the
protesters, said college news director Ellen Berek.
   Kevin Hinton, 21, a junior from Little Rock, Ark., was among the
protesters who came out of the building to address the crowd.
   ``Our efforts are part of efforts initiated four years ago to
raise concerns about the presence of minority faculty here,
minority concerns in the curriculum and minority students at the
school,'' Hinton, who is black, said in an interview.
   ``There's a very strong sense of frustration, a sense of
inertia. There's certainly sympathy, but over the years the school
has failed to take forceful steps,'' he said.
   Minorities make up a record 28 percent of the 1,207 students
just accepted for the fall incoming freshman class, Ms. Berek said.
At present, members of minorities make up 13 percent of the student
body and 10 percent of the 278-teacher faculty.
   About 30 students stayed in the building overnight; an
additional 30 or 40 came in and out during the day, Hinton said.
   Parents visiting the occupied building included veterans of the
civil rights movement who shared advice on how students should
conduct themselves.
   White students were not allowed among the protesters, who
include Hispanic Americans and students from Polynesia, India, the
Caribbean and Asia, Hinton said.
   A group calling itself the Committee Against Racist Education
took over the building Friday. The Victorian house has served as a
makeshift dean's office during renovation of the main
administration building.
   School administrators intend to run the school as usual, working
out of different offices and continuing to hold talks with the
protesters, Ms. Berek said.
   College President Francis C. Oakley has agreed to meet Sunday
with the demonstrators.
   The students planned to stay in the building indefinitely, he
said.

   Officials of a federal agency created to sell
property from insolvent savings institutions traveled in high style
and awarded no-bid contracts to former business associates _ all
while receiving six-figure salaries and bonuses, a congressional
report charges.
   The House Banking Committee found the Federal Asset Disposition
Association, based in San Francisco, ``to be an organization out of
control'' that had ``mushroomed into a bloated bureaucracy.''
   Among the potential conflicts and abuses alleged in the report:
   _The owners of an executive search firm that recommended former
FADA president Roslyn Payne for her job later received $650,000 in
contracts from FADA through another firm that they owned.
   _Ms. Payne charged the agency for the personal travel of herself
and her husband and double-billed for some travel expenses.
   _Robert Axley, former chief legal counsel of the agency, ran up
a hotel bill of $1,200, including laundry, at a hotel in San
Francisco, even though he lived in the city.
   Neither Ms. Payne nor Axley had a published home telephone
listing in the San Francisco area, and calls to their former office
went unanswered Saturday. However, The Washington Post quoted Ms.
Payne as calling the report's allegations ``outrageous.''
   House Banking Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, in a statement
accompanying the report, published Friday in the Congressional
Record, called for FADA to be abolished ``as soon as possible'' and
its duties re-absorbed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp.
   ``We haven't the time to wait ... to rework the unworkable,'' St
Germain said.
   Gerald Carmen, who took over as FADA chief executive in
February, said in an interview Friday that he is taking about six
months to consider whether the agency should continue in its
present structure. However, in the meantime, he promised,
``problems that are real and exist, we're going to fix.''
   The purpose of FADA, created by the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, which regulates 3,147 federally insured S&Ls, is to bring in
money for FSLIC, the financially-strapped fund that guarantees S&L
deposits up to $100,000.
   Instead, the report _ the result of a seven-month investigation
_ said:
   _``FADA ... has not been, and in all likelihood could never be,
a cost-effective solution.''
   _It has evolved into a bureaucracy ``outside all prudent checks
and balances.''
   _``Quality performance was nearly nonexistent.''
   _ FADA employees awarded ``sole-source contracts ... to former
business associates'' and still ``maintain active interest in real
estate investment and development firms, and ties to the savings
and loan industry that would not be appropriate for government
employees.''
   _FSLIC ``employees and contractors (who criticized the agency)
often felt threatened and intimidated.''
   _``Meanwhile, FADA officials lived first class and received
excessive salaries and bonuses _ all at the expense of FSLIC.''
   FADA, according to the report, has more than $5 billion worth of
assets _ loans and real estate _ in its care, yet had managed by
the end of 1987 to sell only $124 million of the property.
   The report said it was ``difficult to determine'' how much money
FADA has wasted, but it said the agency has directly charged $20
million from receiverships of failed S&Ls and passed on $51 million
more in charges from subcontractors. Despite that revenue, the
agency has lost $15 million through the end of last year, the
report said.
   Since its creation in late 1985, FADA has spent $22 million on a
staff that has grown to more than 380, $3 million of that for the
1987 salaries of its 32 top officials, the report said.
   Ms. Payne, the former FADA chief executive officer, received
$325,000 in salaries and bonuses in 1986, a third more than the
salary of the president of the United States, the report noted.
   FADA has spent $1.8 million on travel _ over and above travel to
manage assets in its care _ including hotel rooms at more the $200
a night, the House committee said.
   Included in that is an August 1987 bill from Axley for ``$1,200
for charges at a luxurious San Francisco hotel, including laundry
bills, although he lived in San Francisco,'' the report said.
   It said that Ms. Payne used her FADA credit card to buy airplane
tickets for herself and her husband and included the charge on her
expense form, although FADA accountants refused to pay the bill.
   Between January and May 1987, Ms. Payne received $800 through
double-reporting expenses and did not repay the money until the
overpayment was pointed out by congressional investigators, the
report said.
   Also cited as a ``potential conflict of interest'' were the
$650,000 in payments to the San Diego-based ConAm Corp., an asset
management firm owned by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry.
   They also own Korn-Ferry International, an executive search firm
that was paid $125,000 to come up with a list of candidates for
FADA president. The list included Ms. Payne.
   Home telephone numbers for Korn and Ferry were not listed in the
San Diego area, and neither man returned a reporter's call to their
office. The Post quoted another Korn-Ferry executive as saying that
firm's recommendation of Ms. Payne and ConAm's subsequent work for
FADA were ``purely coincidental.''
   Carmen, Ms. Payne's replacement, said he is cutting FADA's
staff, having reduced the annual payroll so far by $1 million, and
is consolidating office space. He said he expects the agency will
be in the black for the first quarter this year.

   Ships and airplanes searched the
North Atlantic for survivors Saturday near the blazing remains of a
Greek tanker that broke in two, leaving one crewman known dead and
28 people missing.
   But as darkness fell, the U.S. Coast Guard said it was
suspending search operations and there was no plan to resume them
Sunday.
   Petty Officer Brad Terrill of the U.S. Coast Guard's Atlantic
Operations said, ``Search conditions were excellent all day with
good to excellent visibility, low seas and mild winds. But nothing
has been spotted since the one body was recovered Friday evening.''
   A Dutch cargo ship recovered the body of Polish seaman Andrej
Szukalski, 41, from the oil-slicked sea near the 500-foot Athenian
Venture around 6.p.m. Friday.
   ``He was in a lifejacket but not in a liferaft,'' said Terrill
in a telephone interview from New York. Terrill said an earlier
report that the ship's log was found with the body was incorrect,
and the document was the victim's passport.
   U.S. Coast Guard officials said there were 29 people aboard the
tanker, including the wives of five crewmen, and it was believed
that all of the victims were Polish nationals.
   Terrill said the stern section of the 18,000-ton tanker, hauling
gasoline and bunker fuel from Amsterdam to New York, was still
burning and ``probably will be burning for quite a bit of time.''
The bow portion sank Friday.
   The crippled tanker was about 800 miles east of New York when
the Canadian research ship Hudson spotted it ablaze after midnight
370 miles southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.
   The Hudson reported that one of the tanker's lifeboats had been
launched and a Canadian coast guard spokesman said three life rafts
and a lifeboat were missing from the tanker, leading to hope there
might be survivors.
   But Lt. Cmdr. Kent Fisher of the U.S. Coast Guard said the
lifeboats may have been missing because they burned and there was
little hope of finding any survivors.
   Although the Coast Guard initially said the tanker had sent no
distress signals, Terrill said Saturday: ``There was a very brief
SOS (Thursday) evening which was heard up and down the East Coast.
It was just one brief mayday and that's all anyone heard.''
   Terrill said a Canadian airplane and the Hudson were joined by
two U.S. Coast Guard C-130 aircraft and a cutter in the search for
survivors and they were working in much better weather late
Saturday that they had earlier.
   Early Saturday, the tanker's fiery hulk was being buffeted in
rain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 5-foot
swells. But later in the day, Terrill said, there were calm and
rolling seas three to five feet high, with good visibility and high
overcast.
   There was no indication what caused the fire.
   Patron Marine of Athens, owners of the Cypriot-registered
tanker, notified the Coast Guard that there had been 29 people
aboard the Athenian Venture _ including 24 crewmen and the wives of
five of them.
   About one-sixth of the ship _ the bow _ broke off and sank, with
five-sixths of the rear of the ship still burning intensely,
Terrill said.
   Capt. Loran Strum of the Hudson said the tanker was burning
fiercely and had broken in two by the time his ship approached.
   ``We could see fire through the house windows so she's all
burned out in the bridge sector,'' Strum said in a ship-to-shore
radio interview. ``I think I could quite safely say it would be
impossible for anyone to be alive aboard.''
   Strum, a 37-year veteran of the sea, said a column of smoke from
the tanker's stern could be seen for 30 miles.

<HEAD>Israel Reportedly Had Abu Jihad Killed Because He Planned New
Terrorism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel had the Palestine Liberation
Organization's No. 2 leader assassinated last week because he
planned new terrorist attacks on Israel and its allies, including
the United States, a magazine reported Saturday.
   U.S. News & World Report, quoting Jerusalem sources in its May 2
edition, says the decision to assassinate Khalil al-Wazir, also
known as Abu Jihad, despite known risks, was based on more than his
alleged involvement in a recent bus hijacking by the PLO that
resulted in three Israeli deaths.
   Quoting Israeli intelligence reports, the magazine says: ``Abu
Jihad was said to have struck deals with Libya's Moammar Gadhafi
and various East European intelligence agencies to restore the
sophisticated PLO terrorist and combat capability that Israel had
destroyed in the invasion of Lebanon.
   ``The PLO would then launch a major new series of terrorist
attacks against Israel itself and Israeli interests and supporters
in other countries, including the United States,'' the magazine
says.
   Abu Jihad was gunned downed April 16 in his villa in Tunis,
Tunisia.
   U.S. News says some foreign security specialists doubt key
aspects of the Israeli version of the story and Jerusalem's reasons
for revealing it.
   The magazine quotes one Western official as saying: ``It has
self-serving aspects, involves a strange bunch of bedfellows and
doesn't make sense for the PLO at this time.''
   The officials also are skeptical of Abu Jihad's alleged presence
at meetings with leaders he has fought for years, and whether the
Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, could identify precise
details of plans for joint actions by Arab groups that have battled
one another as fiercely as they have fought the Jewish state,
according to the magazine.
   ``But Israeli sources insist that the reasons for hitting Abu
Jihad _ and striking now _ were compelling,'' U.S. News says.

   Church bells tolled 28 times as
hundreds of people gathered Saturday for a memorial service in
honor of the construction workers killed a year ago in the collapse
of an apartment building.
   ``Look over your shoulders and remember the frailty of our
humanity and the eternalness of our spirit,'' Monsignor William
Scheyd, pastor of St. Augustine Cathedral, said just before
ceremony broke up early during a sudden downpour.
   Scheyd spoke in Wheeler park, which houses a monument to the men
killed in the L'Ambiance Plaza apartment building. The accident
site is visible from the park, which is adjacent to City Hall.
   Clergymen prayed and read each victim's name, and black-attired
survivors of the victims huddled with politicians in dark suits and
construction workers in jeans as the skies darkened.
   As the cold rain got heavier, the small group of politicans
standing under a covered platform who were scheduled to talk chose
to end the ceremony early, before a moment of silence planned for
1:36 p.m., the minute that the building collapsed on April 23, 1987.
   ``There was something very symbolic here ... that we were
covered and they (families and rescue volunteers) weren't,'' said
U.S. Rep. Christopher Shays.
   As the crowd quickly broke up, a lone construction worker in
jeans and a green hard hat lingered in the heavy rain, then turned
and walked slowly away, the last to leave.
   Shortly after the ceremony, there were no mourners at the site.
But two sprays of fresh red, white and pink carnations adorned the
fence and a twisted blue sign with the name of the project still
lay on the ground.
   The memorial service began earlier at St. Augustine's, where
clergymen encouraged survivors to reach out to each other and
remember the outpouring of generosity from people around the world.
They also noted that there had been two births and one adoption in
victims' families in the past year.
   ``Although we were stricken by tragedy on April 23, 1987, we
were not destroyed,'' Scheyd said.
   ``As we come here today to look back, let us not be afraid to
look forward. The future will come for each of us.''
   After the ceremony, several politicians and union leaders
focused on the future of legislative efforts to improve
construction safety.
   ``When people say this will never happen again, I wonder if it
will,'' said U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. He said a bill
requiring employers to post a notice if dangerous chemicals were on
a site was blocked by a recent Senate filibuster.
   ``Safety in the workplace seems to be a low priority with my
colleagues and with the people,'' Weicker said.
   ``There was a tremendous showing here (today) _ now we need to
work on legislation and see this doesn't happen again,'' said Frank
Carroll Jr., business manager for Local 488 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. ``The hearts of the families are
still broken.''

<HEAD>Karpov's Victory A Challenge To Kasparov</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first World Cup Chess Tournament
closed Saturday and experts said the victorious Anatoly Karpov
remains a force in the game and a threat to champion Garri Kasparov.
   The tournament was the first of six competitons that form the
World Cup championship. Soviet grandmaster Karpov won the the
$20,000 top prize Friday by scoring 11 points out of a possible 16,
a point ahead of fellow Soviet Valery Salov.
   The World Cup series was organized by the Grandmasters
Association, a body set up in 1986 at the urging of champion
Kasparov, also of the Soviet Union, to increase the influence of
the game's leading grandmasters.
   Kasparov and other grandmasters have feuded often with the the
World Chess Federation, the game's governing body.
   Experts said during closing ceremonies Saturday that Karpov
remains a major threat to Kasparov's supremacy. Kasparov, who did
not compete in this tournament, beat Karpov in 1985 to become the
world champion.
   ``This was a normal result for Karpov. He's the second-best
player in the world and there is clearly a big gap between second
and third in the world at the moment,'' said Leontxo Garica, a
Spanish chess commentator.
   In the World Cup series, each of the world's 25 leading
grandmasters will compete in four of the six events. The winner of
the cup will be the player with the best three results.
   Third place on Friday was shared by John Nunn of England,
Yugoslav Grandmaster Ljubomir Ljubojevic and Alexander Beliavsky of
the Soviet Union each with 9.5 points.
   Lajos Portisch of Hungary finished sixth after holding Viktor
Korchnoi to a draw with the black pieces. Portisch tied with Ulf
Andersson of Sweden.
   Korchnoi, 57, a Soviet defector who now plays for Switzerland,
finished way in 15th place.
   Jon Speelman of England placed eighth after agreeing to a draw
with Jan Timman of the Netherlands.
   Timman, the world's third-ranked player in the world, finished
10th.
   Andrei Sokolov of the Soviet Union defeated Luc Winants of
Belgium and finished ninth with eight points.
   Yasser Seirawan, the United States' highest-ranked player,
overwhelmed former world champion Miklhail Tal for a share of 10th
place.
   The other 1988 World Cup contests will be held in Belfort,
France, and Rekjavik, Iceland, with next year's competitions in
Barcelona, Spain; Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and Skelleftea,
Sweden.
   The Belfort tournament, which features both Kasparov and Karpov,
is scheduled to start June 12.

   A woman killed a man by running over his head
with her car, then told police she had mistaken him for her
boyfriend, authorities said.
   Donna Faye Williams, 31, was charged Friday with first-degree
murder in the death of Joel Robinson, 28, who died of massive head
injuries.
   Williams told police that she had mistaken Robinson for her
boyfriend, Louis Teague, 31, when she knocked him down with her
car, then returned to drive over his head.
   ``Whether she knew who he was is unknown,'' said Jeff Jamieson,
assistant circuit attorney. ``She said she thought it was her
boyfriend.''
   The incident occurred shortly after 1:30 a.m. Friday in front of
Robinson's north side home, where Teague and Williams had quarreled
earlier, Jamieson said.
   Williams got into her car and intentionally rammed the car
parked in front of hers. Robinson and Teague came outside to stop
her, Jamieson said.
   When Williams tried to sideswipe the parked car, she hit the car
and Robinson, knocking him to the ground, Jamieson said. Williams
then drove down the street, turned around and came back, running
over Robinson, police said.
   Williams, arrested at the scene about 20 minutes later, gave a
taped admission to police, Jamieson said.

<TEXT>
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita won final Parliamentary
approval Saturday for his new government but the five-party
coalition is already embroiled in a dispute over Italy's Middle
East policy.
   After a two-day debate, the Christian Democrat leader won a
confidence vote in the Senate 177-106. The coalition had won a vote
of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies Thursday.
   Both votes were a formality since the coalition has a
comfortable majority in both houses.
   De Mita formed Italy's 48th post-World War II government on
April 13 after a month-long political crisis caused by the
resignation of Premier Giovanni Goria, a fellow Christian Democrat
who served for 7{ months.
   The government is made up of the five parties that have governed
most of the decade _ the dominant Christian Democrats, the
Socialists and the small Republican, Social Democrat and Liberal
parties.
   De Mita has expressed hope his government can last through the
end of the legislative term in 1992, but a dispute developed as he
was winning parliamentary approval.
   It involves Italy's policies toward Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization including the months of violence in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and the April 16
assassination in Tunisia of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir. It is
widely believed Wazir was slain by Israeli commandos.
   Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, a former premier, proposed that
Italy give official recognition to the PLO. The PLO does have a
representative in Italy, but he does not have full diplomatic
status.
   Craxi's suggestion was criticized by the Liberals and
Republicans, the two most conservative parties in the coalition.
   At a news conference Saturday in Naples, Craxi added a new
element to the debate. He suggested the European Economic Community
(Common Market) assume a mandate to administer the Israeli-occupied
territories for a transitional period pending a solution of the
Palestinian problem.
   Craxi said Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were
oppressed and had the ``right and duty'' to rebel against Israeli
occupation. He said Israel had the right to demand secure frontiers
``but nothing else.''
   The Socialist leader also said the Italian government should
lodge a protest with Israeli if it is confirmed that Italian
airspace was violated by an Israeli Boeing 707 that reportedly
helped direct the commando team that killed Wazir.
   Italian air controllers have reported that an Israeli plane,
which identified itself as a civilian aircraft, passed through
their jurisdictional zone near Sicily the night of the
assassination.
   In his 90-minute speech before the Senate vote, De Mita said the
position of Italian governments on the Arab-Israeli conflict has
always been ``constant, intelligent and active'' and that he would
follow that path. Italy has maintained good relations with both
Israel and the Arab world.
   De Mita called the assassination of Wazir a ``useless crime,
which makes the process of peace more difficult.''
   On domestic issues, De Mita restated his intentions to
streamline political institutions. He has promised to make the
legislative process more efficient and strengthen the executive
branch.
   De Mita's close adviser on institutional reforms, Sen. Roberto
Ruffilli, was assassinated a week ago by Red Brigades terrorists.

   Separatist militants on this French
Pacific island clashed with police Sunday as voting began in
France's presidential election. Two policemen were reported shot in
separate incidents.
   Meanwhile, Melanesian separatists holding 27 police officers
hostage evaded a police search in this French territory and
demanded that elections be canceled.
   Minister of Overseas Territories Bernard Pons was dispatched
from Paris Saturday by Premier Jacques Chirac to oversee the voting.
   After the residents of the tiny French islands of Wallis and
Futuna, the New Caledonians were the first to cast ballots on
Sunday. It was still early morning in France. Voters in the French
territories also participate in France's national elections.
   Police in Noumea said separatists erected barricades in several
villages to disrupt voting. One policeman was reported wounded by a
gunshot in Pouembout, on the main island's west coast 160 miles
north of Noumea, and a second wounded at Canala on the east coast.
   In pre-election violence on Saturday, three security men of a
pro-French party were shot and wounded and police fired tear gas in
two towns to stop rioting.
   The hostages were taken Friday during a battle at a police
station that left three officers dead and about 20 people wounded
on the tiny island of Ouvea, about 80 miles off the coast of New
Caledonia.
   Two wounded officers and four others were hospitalized in
Noumea, the capital. One officers had been shot in the head and
flown to a hospital in Sydney, Australia.
   Kanaks, as native Melanesians are known, make up 43 percent of
the territory's 145,000 people. The rest are European settlers,
Polynesians and Asians.
   Many Melanesians seek independence from France, while most of
the European settlers wish to remain French. The separatists vowed
to boycott Sunday's election and do what they could to interfere
with voting.
   Leopold Joredie, security minister of the separatist
``government of Kanaky,'' said the kidnappers are demanding that
300 police reinforcements be withdrawn, that Paris send emissaries
to discuss independence and that the election be canceled.
   Joredie, who has been in contact with the kidnappers, said the
hostages were in good condition. However, he added, the kidnappers
were ``ready to keep them (the gendarmes) as long as necessary.
   ``If the government wants to intervene, they must take
responsiblity,'' he said.
   About 160 additional reinforcements from the National
Gendarmerie left Paris Friday to assist the 3,000 police already in
New Caledonia.
   The kidnappers were believed to have divided into groups and
fled into a forest in northern New Caledonia.
   A spokesman for the gendarmerie in Noumea, who refused to be
identified, said hundreds of officers were searching for the
hostages.
   Also Saturday, three security men with the pro-French Rally for
Caledonia in the Republic party were shot and wounded while driving
through Canala.
   Jacques Lafleur, the party's president, said the men were in
Canala to ``protect those who want to vote Sunday.''
   Lafleur's party is the local branch of Chirac's conservative
Rally for the Republic.
   The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, the main
separatist organization, is boycotting the elections. It also
boycotted last year's referendum on independence, saying only
Melanesians should be allowed to vote. The territory voted
overwhelmingly for France.
   The bloodshed is part of long-simmering tensions in New
Caledonia, which has been under direct French rule since 1853 and
is France's largest possession in the South Pacific.

   Jesse Jackson revisited a Democratic
stronghold Saturday to collect favors on a blue-collar cause he
supported and to tap the working class sentiments he hopes to
represent in the White House.
   ``In the Mon Valley I stood with you, fighting for our children
... fighting for justice. Now, on Tuesday, my friends ... stand
with me,'' Jackson said at the first of three riverside stops in
Monongahela Valley towns that have been staggered by the decline of
steelmaking in the American industry's birthplace.
   In January 1985, after losing the 1984 Democratic presidential
nomination, Jackson appeared in neighboring Duquesne with
unemployed steel workers to fight for the reopening of a giant
ironmaking blast furnace affectionately known as Dorothy Six.
   The furnace and the surrounding Duquesne Works have been closed
by USX Corp. and will be demolished to make way for an industrial
park.
   Jackson, reminded Saturday of the disappointing results of the
fruitless struggle to have the furnace restarted, said, ``It was
the principle ... to try to sustain their faith and their will to
fight back.''
   ``Those workers are fighting against the odds of a government
administration that does not care about their predicament, '' he
said as he campaigned before Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary in
which Jackson is pitted against the current Democratic
front-runner, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Between stops, Jackson and his campaign workers traveled the
Monongahela River on a sightseeing boat, floating past red brick
and aluminum-sided homes between scrap yards, coal piles, rail
sidings, fuel tanks, greening valley walls, churches and war
memorials of the struggling towns of Monongahela, Elizabeth and
McKeesport.
   The Democrats' 12,000-to-2,000 voter registration edge over
Republicans in McKeesport is typical of the grip the party has had
on Allegheny County over the last 50 years. Walter Mondale beat
Ronald Reagan by 88,000 votes in the county in 1984, said
Pittsburgh Democratic Chairman Frank Lucchino.
   Jackson was one of the biggest names to join the fight for
Dorothy Six.
   ``I think he's gone out on a limb to identify himself with that
sort of small and powerless struggle,'' said David Demarest of
Pittsburgh.
   The Carnegie Mellon University English professor and his wife,
Marlene, said they liked Jackson as one who could broaden the
Democratic Party.
   ``If we can't bring blacks into mainstream politics, we're in
trouble,'' he said.
   ``Our campaign is changing the face of America,'' Jackson said.
``Coalitions are coming together that never were involved in
politics before.''
   One such newcomer is Joseph Heckel, 62, of Mars.
   ``Jackson represents humanity. He'd like to build rather than
destroy,'' said Heckel, a World War II Navy veteran who has been to
Nicaragua to help the village of El Cedro rebuild after being
devastated by the U.S.-backed Contras.
   ``Our (foreign) policy is just a disaster, and Jackson is the
only one who represents change,'' Heckel said.
   Demarest favors worker-ownership as a way to revive the area's
manufacturing economy.
   ``The inability of Pittsburgh to do that in steel is kind of a
missing link, and I see Jackson as being able to communicate
strongly on that level,'' Demarest said.
   Jackson said rebuilding roads, bridges and other public
structures would re-employ displaced steel workers.
   ``We're not fighting for welfare, we're fighting for fair
share,'' he said at a park beside USX's closed National Tube Works,
the now silent engine of McKeesport's whimpering economy.
   Jackson salted his three speeches with invocations against dope,
despair and prejudice. He encouraged his listeners to have hope and
to organize behind him Tuesday.

<HEAD>Sister Supports Use of Brother's Heart Before He Was Identified</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of a brain-dead man's heart
for a transplant before he was identified was justified because it
helped save another life, the man's sister said.
   The transplant was criticized Friday by medical ethicists.
   ``I'm happy that at least, even if his body is dead, his heart
is beating in another person,'' said Maria Celsa Torres, 20, sister
of Eleno Ulloa Ramirez, 19. ``I'm also very satisfied with the
explanation that they gave me, the authorities.''
   Ramirez was found unconscious with no identification on a Costa
Mesa street early Tuesday and declared brain dead the next day
after surgery to remove a clot in the brain. Police believe he was
the victim of a blow to the head.
   Before he was identified, doctors at Hoag Memorial Hospital
Presbyterian transplanted his heart into Dr. Norton Humphreys, 58,
a retired Fountain Valley physician suffering from a degenerative
heart disease.
   A nursing supervisor who declined to give her name said Saturday
that Humphreys' condition was listed as critical but stable.
   Ramirez's heart was transplanted under a state law that allows
removal of an organ without the permission of the donor or his
family if police are unable to identify someone after making a
diligent effort for 24 hours.
   His relatives didn't find out his heart was transplanted until
Friday.
   ``I think it was good what they did, taking my brother's
heart,'' Mrs. Torres said Friday. ``They saved another life. Yes,
it is painful for us, but we have to accept the reality of it.''
   Mrs. Torres said she last saw her brother on Monday, and that on
Tuesday, her father, contacted her and said he had been unable to
reach his son.
   A friend who works at the hospital told family members a man on
life support there could be the missing man, and they gave
officials there information on Ramirez.
   Mrs. Torres said that on Friday morning, people she assumed were
police officers in plain clothes, took her to the hospital to
identify her brother's body.
   The use of organs for transplant before the victim was
identified drew some criticism.
   George Annas, a law and ethics professor at Boston University's
Medical School, said the procedure was ``incredible.''
   ``If other people have done it, they haven't talked about it in
the newspaper, that's for sure,'' Annas said.
   John Robertson, an ethics professor at the University of Texas
in Austin and a member of the National Task Force on Organ
Transplantation defended the operation.
   ``First of all, we're dealing with someone who is dead. It's not
like they're harming the person. That body is either going to get
cremated or buried,'' Robertson said. ``I'm not sure there's any
serious abuse if they're complying with applicable law.''

<HEAD>Movie `The Last Emperor' Draws Large Audiences in Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Last Emperor,'' the first movie shot
in communist China to be shown on this Nationalist Chinese island,
opened to large crowds Saturday.
   People formed lines to buy tickets to the movie that won nine
Academy Awards. It is about the life of China's last emperor and
was filmed by an international production company.
   ``It is very touching,'' reporter Huang Wu-lan of the China
Times Express said of the movie that opened in 20 theaters in
Taipei and five other cities.
   She said Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci presented a
Chinese world ``very real and persuasive to the young generation of
Chinese growing up in Taiwan.''
   A vast majority of Taiwan's nearly 20 million people are ethnic
Chinese. The Chinese Nationalist government fled to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war to the communists and has since refused
all official contacts with mainland China.
   Unofficially the policy has been relaxed in recent months.
Taiwanese Chinese can travel to China to visit family members and
many mainland products are now legally sold in Taiwan.
   Last month, the government sanctioned the showing of foreign
films shot on the mainland, but movies made by China still are
forbidden.
   Government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming said the Nationalists allowed
the showing of ``The Last Emperor'' because the movie ``does not
contain the poisonous elements of communism nor violate our
national interests.''
   But Shaw said government censors cut a 30-second jail scene in
which prisoners sing ``Dongfang Hong,'' or ``The East is Red,''
which praises communism.
   ``We don't have to listen to this song,'' Shaw told reporters
Thursday.
   Officials of the Government Information Office, which screens
movies, said a brief scene showing the young emperor flirting in
bed with his empress also was cut.
   ``The Last Emperor'' follows the life of Pu Yi as child emperor
of the Qing Dynasty, later Japan's World War II puppet ruler of
Manchuria, then a prisoner of the communists and finally a
gardener. Pu Yi died in Beijing in 1967.

   Enthusiastic bidders ran up prices Saturday at
the opening of a 10-day auction of Andy Warhol's personal
collection, paying more than $5 million for the art deco and art
nouveau items that went on the block first.
   ``It's amazing the prices people are paying _ some are going for
10 times the amount estimated,'' said Sotheby's spokesman Matthew
Weigman,
   More than 10,000 items, from paintings, rare art deco furniture,
watches and clocks and photographs of Marilyn Monroe are being put
on the auction block in one of the most extensive sales ever held
by Sotheby's in New York.
   Pieces auctioned Saturday included art nouveau and art deco
furniture, jewelry, lamps and household items.
   The two sessions fetched a total of $5,314,347, more than twice
what Sotheby's expected, said Diana Levitt, a spokeswoman for
Sotheby's auction house.
   ``It was a wonderful day,'' said Levitt, who said the sky-high
prices were attributable ``to some degree (to) the Warhol factor,
but to a great degree the quality and rarity of the objects.''
   Proceeds will benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, which will support and award grants to cultural institutions
in the United States and abroad.
   The highest bid was $275,000 by an anonymous private collector
for a wood center table by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, made about
1902. Sotheby's expected the table to sell for $30,000 to $50,000.
   The collection includes more than 60 works, including paintings
by Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist and Cy Twombly.
Before Saturday's bidding, Sotheby's had expected the collection to
sell for $10 to $15 million.
   The crowd, estimated by Sotheby's at 2,200, seemed as eclectic
as the collection. Some came to buy specific items and others came
to buy something connected with Andy Warhol.
   One man, Alan Dolleck, came to buy something for himself but was
disappointed: ``The prices are outrageous; they went out of sight.
It's not worth it.''
   Most of the people actually buying were dealers looking for rare
items.
   ``I came to buy some of the art deco vases because it is very
difficult to get them in Europe, but they are too expensive here,''
said Vincenzo Geddes da Filicaia, an antique dealer from Italy.
   ``I could get them cheaper elsewhere, but it is because of the
Andy Warhol name that I cannot afford them.''
   Warhol fans merely wanted something connected with the famed pop
artist, who died last year.
   ``I wanted a very strong piece of jewelry connected with
Warhol,'' said Sheila Tronn Cooper, a theatrical producer and
writer, looking at a piece that would go on sale Sunday. ``I saw
this bracelet and fell in love with it.''
   Cooper also came to buy a graduation present for her son, who
she said was ``an artist somewhat like Warhol, and I thought it
would be nice to get him a graduation gift that had belonged to
Andy.''
   Cooper, who has attended many auctions, decribed Saturday's sale
as one of the most exciting she had been to. ``It's mind
boggling,'' she said. ``There are so many newcomers, its like a
party.''
   Sotheby's distributed a special sheet of advice for first-time
bidders.
   A sharkskin-covered console by Pierre Legrain fetched $209,000,
as did a matching table, both purchased by a foreign dealer.
Sotheby's had estimated winning bids between $40,000 and $60,000
for each piece.
   An ivory inlaid armchair by Ebene De Macassar was sold for
$154,000 to a private collector. Sotheby's expected $40,000 to
$60,000.
   A silver tureen and cover made by Frenchman Jean Puiforcat,
which was bought by a London dealer for $55,000. Sotheby's had
estimated it would go for $10,000 to $15,000.
   A silver, four-piece tea and coffee set, also by Puiforcat, was
sold to a New York dealer for $44,000, while Sotheby's officially
had expected $12,000 to $16,000.
   One of the most unusual purchases, according to Weigman, was a
gold and silver ring by Jean Despres estimated at $1,800 to $2,500
and sold to an anonymous buyer for $28,600.
   The remaining auctions will offer an enormous collection of
wristwatches, Indian rugs, folk art, drawings and prints. Warhol's
collection of American classical and federal furniture, which
Sotheby's called the largest and most important available for
auction in many years, will be sold Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A year after Gov. Bob Martinez signed
one of the more controversial levies in Florida history, lawmakers
are avoiding tax talk because of battles that left many licking
political wounds in an election year.
   One year ago Saturday, Martinez signed a bill initiating a 5
percent tax on service industries ranging from lawn care to law and
from accounting to advertising.
   The tax sparked an outcry from many service groups, and
companies such as Lever Brothers, Procter & Gamble and Nabisco
withdrew local advertising of national brands. The protests
prompted Martinez to reverse himself and lead a successful drive to
repeal the tax and replace it with a sales tax increase.
   But the wear and tear of the tax battle is still evident, and
some say the state merely put off a long-term revenue problem.
   The Legislature, which is three weeks into this year's two-month
regular session, shows signs of burnout after five special sessions
in the last 15 months.
   ``I think the session in terms of actually starting has almost
been delayed by the backup of special sessions and the result of
everything that has happened in the last year,'' said House Speaker
Jon Mills.
   Three of the five sessions concerned the services tax, which had
been heralded as fair because it tapped the state's fastest growing
economic sector and because higher-income people purchase more
services than those with lower incomes.
   Martinez, a self-proclaimed fiscal conservative who does not
face re-election until 1990, still is working to rebuild his
tarnished standing with voters.
   Proponents of the services tax said it would ensure adequate
revenue to provide services to the state's burgeoning population,
and they were outraged when Martinez flip-flopped on the measure
last August.
   The governor also angered Republicans because he pushed for a 1
percentage point increase in sales tax as a replacement instead of
meeting a 1986 campaign pledge to cut $800 million from state
spending.
   In his State of the State address earlier this month, Martinez
promised to veto any tax bill sent to his desk this year.
   ``The governor has not intentions of supporting the services tax
again,'' press secretary Jon Peck said.
   But some legislators, including Mills, predict that the
Legislature is likely to consider another services tax eventually.
   The boost in the sales tax to 6 percent, which took effect Feb.
1, is projected to raise $1 billion this year, just as the services
tax was expected to do.
   But economists say the services tax would produce more revenue
over time as the state's services sector grows, revenue that some
lawmakers believe is badly needed.
   The governor has proposed a $20.3 billion budget for the fiscal
year beginning July 1, up from $18.5 billion this year. Many
Democratics say even that increase would not satisfy the needs of a
growing population _ the state had just over 12 million residents
in 1987 and officials say it is growing by up to 1,000 people a day
_ and correct for previous inadequacies in some programs.
   Martinez and the Legislature must reach a budget compromise by
July 1.
   The governor has proposed increasing fees for such things as
state university tuition, fishing licenses, and environmental
permits.
   Lawmakers have quietly discussed increasing gasoline taxes to
help pay for transportation needs, but no formal proposal has been
launched and Martinez has refused to consider such a plan.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was
quoted Saturday as saying he could retire any time, but that caving
in to U.S. pressure to resign would have a domino effect on the
rest of Latin America.
   ``Gen. Noriega can go any day, on Aug. 12, Nov. 3, Dec. 19, the
first of January, 1989,'' the armed forces chief and Panama's de
facto ruler said in an interview with the pro-government newspaper
``La Estrella de Panama'' (The Star of Panama). ``The calendar is
open and full of dates.''
   But Noriega gave no indication he is willing to step down soon.
   Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges he denies, has been head of the 15,000-member
Defense Forces since 1983. His official biography says he is 50
years old, but his high school yearbooks indicate he is 54.
   As he has in the past, Noriega said economic and other pressures
applied by the United States to force his ouster are motivated by
political considerations unrelated to the drug charges against him.
   Although he did not specifically refer to the matter, Noriega
has said previously that U.S. actions are the result of his refusal
to help the Reagan Administration overthrow Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   If he submits to U.S. pressure, the general said, ``It will mean
that like a domino, the destiny of all other Latin American peoples
is marked.''
   ``When a people are not docile to an empire, those people and
their leaders will be made a target of that empire,'' said Noriega.
   Noriega also scoffed at reports that some opposition figures and
the Roman Catholic Church have been secretly trying to negotiate
his resignation with his supporters, including leaders of the major
pro-government political party.
   ``It's too bad they're not talking with Gen. Noriega,'' the
general said, adding that many opposition leaders ``are trying to
ride the wave and gain prestige.''
   ``They all want to be like Monsignor Obando y Bravo, they want
to be like Oscar Arias, Vinicio Cerezo or the secretary of the
Organization of American States,'' he said.
   Obando y Bravo is the Catholic archbishop of Nicaragua who has
mediated talks between that government and rebels Arias and Cerezo
are the presidents of Costa Rica and Guatemala who pushed for those
negotiations.
   Panama's Catholic hierachy called on the Reagan administration
Friday to end its sanctions against Panama and said the country has
suffered enough.
   ``We cannot continue like this,'' the church said in an
eight-page pastoral letter signed by Archbishop Marcos Gregorio
McGrath and the nation's 10 bishops.
   Describing the sanctions as the cause of ``misery and
desperation'' for thousands of Panamanians, the letter said they go
beyond ``any strategy of political pressure and constitute by
themselves a threat to the life of our people.''
   Speaking with reporters on Saturday, McGrath said Panama was
going through ``the pathetic and slow agony of a nation whose
economy is rapidly being destroyed.''
   ``In two or three weeks there will be chaos in this country'' if
the sanctions are not lifted, he said.
   The archbishop called for urgent negotiations to resolve the
crisis. Some talks are being held but ``they are not the really
effective conversations that carry commitment that the nation
needs,'' he said.
   In its efforts to oust Noriega, the Reagan administration has
cut off all military and economic aid to Panama, blocked its assets
in the United States and prohibited any U.S. payments to the
government. Panama uses the U.S. dollar for its currency.
   The sanctions, combined with a lengthy shutdown of the nation's
120 banks and a two-week general strike in March, have brought
Panama's economy to a virtual halt.
   Noriega-backed supporters in the National Assembly voted Feb. 26
to oust President Eric Arturo Delvalle a day after Delvalle tried
to fire Noriega. Delvalle, whom the United States still recognizes
as the country's head of state, has remained in hiding in Panama
since his ouster.

<TEXT>
   The memory of an anti-slavery protest by
Quakers 300 years ago should stir consciences against modern-day
injustices, a group that marked the event was told Saturday.
   ``I think the real question that we should be asking ourselves
today, especially those of us who are white, is how in the name of
God could it be that it has taken us 300 years to get rid of racism
and we still haven't done it,'' Stephen Cary, chairman of the
American Friends Service Committee, said.
   ``The only thing that I can think of that's encouraging is that
for the past 35 years, we've been gaining on it.''
   Cary spoke to about 300 people at a vacant lot in the city's
Germantown section, which was the site of a house where where
Francis Daniel Pastorius and three other Dutch Quakers in 1688
drafted one of the earliest recorded protests against slavery,
according to The Germantown Protest, the organization that
sponsored the gathering.
   The statement was forwarded to larger Quaker assemblies, which
tabled it. It was not until 1776 that Quakers, who became leaders
of the abolition movement, forbade slaveholding by their members.
In 1780, Pennsylvania became the first state to pass a law phasing
out slavery.
   One speaker told the audience that the German and Dutch Quakers
who authored the statement saw only the beginnings of a rigid form
of slavery.
   ``We think of their protest as a protest against something that
was in place. It was not,,'' said Stephanie Wolf, president of the
Germantown Historical Society and a history professor at the
University of Pennsylvania
   ``It was a brave and courageous thing in a new land with a new
language for them to do.''
   The organizers of the commemoration drew up a petition called
``1988 Germantown Protest,'' which said, ``Our Germantown forbears
would have us stand today with the homeless, the hungry, the
unemployed and the neglected.''
   Robert Simpkins, a retired tax assessor, said the need for
protests still existed.
   ``Today, the idea of slavery of men doesn't exist, but the
shortcomings of life such as a lack of decent housing, waste of
youth and other areas where the quality of life is wanting,''
Simpkins said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who put his campaign
for the Democratic presidential nomination on hold Thursday, scored
big gains at the expense of Jesse Jackson as Kansas Democrats
elected national delegates at congressional district conventions
Saturday.
   But the big winner in Kansas was still Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, the front-runner for the party's nomination
following a big victory last Tuesday in New York's primary.
   Of 26 delegates elected at the district conventions Saturday,
Dukakis claimed 12, Jackson seven and Gore five, with two others
elected as uncommitted.
   That breakdown will dictate how 13 more Kansas delegates are
elected at a meeting of the Democratic State Convention on May 14.
   Dukakis will claim seven of those 13 for a total of 19 elected
delegates from the Sunflower State. Jackson and Gore of Tennessee
will split the other six at-large delegates, giving Jackson a total
of 10 of the elected Kansas delegates and Gore eight.
   Kansas also will have two uncommitted elected delegates and six
so-called super delegates from elected and party officials for its
total of 45 delegates at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta in July.
   The super delegates are officially uncommitted and none has yet
declared a preference between Dukakis and Jackson, the only
remaining active candidates.
   Based on voting at county caucuses held March 19, Dukakis had
been projected to win 11 delegates at the district level. He got
one more, when previously uncommitted delegates threw in with the
Dukakis forces at the 4th District convention in Wichita. That took
a delegate away from Jackson.
   Jackson also lost delegates to Gore at the 2nd District
convention in Topeka and at the 3rd District convention in Prairie
Village.
   When Gore gained those two delegates at the district level, it
enabled him to meet a party requirement that a candidate garner at
least 15 percent of the delegates in order to contend for the 13
state delegates.
   With eight delegates from the district conventions to Jackson's
10, Gore was able, mathematically, to claim three of the 13 state
delegates. Jackson also will get three of the delegates to be named
by the state committee, while Dukakis will get seven of them.
   Jackson would have won 10 delegates at the district level and
six more at the state level for a total of 16 if he had maintained
his support from the county caucuses. But the erosion cost him six
delegates, enabling Gore to add five to what had been projected for
him. Dukakis picked up the other delegate Jackson lost from his
projected total following the local caucuses five weeks ago.
   ``The reason for the shifts is the Gore people stayed in there
and picked up the uncommitted in key places,'' said state party
Chairman Jim Parrish.
   ``Had it not been for the 15 percent threshold, they would have
had five delegates based on the county caucuses,'' Parrish said.
``Now they recaptured them, plus one. This shifting around got him
the boost he needed.''
   Fred Phelps Jr., a Topeka attorney who was a chief organizer for
Gore in the 2nd District of northeast Kansas, said, ``We're just

   Democratic presidential candidates Michael
Dukakis and Jesse Jackson called on President Reagan on Saturday to
reconsider his threat to veto a trade bill that includes a
provision requiring companies to give advance notice before closing
plants.
   Debating for the second night in a row, Dukakis and Jackson
continued their kid-glove competition for their party's
presidential nomination, steadfastly avoiding strong criticism of
each other.
   Even when pressed to cite differences, the two candidates lapsed
into familiar campaign rhetoric that hardly qualified as political
attacks.
   Jackson cited his proposals for specific budget figures to deal
with national problems, while Dukakis cited his experience as
governor of Massachusetts.
   ``I have put the numbers together to pay for my dreams,'' said
Jackson. ``I take the heat, but I am consistent.''
   ``I don't just talk about jobs,'' said Dukakis. ``I've helped to
create and save hundreds of thousands of jobs.''
   After the debate, Jackson said Dukakis ``did not answer the
question of the budget. ... I know it's good to project for a
national health care plan, which I support. But it will cost.''
   Dukakis appeared in the debate press room after Jackson and
responded to the former civil rights actvist's criticism by saying,
``I've already made many commitments in dollars. ... I know what
it's like to walk into a deficit. ... The president of the United
States had better be somebody who knows how to mop up red ink.''
   The candidates were given some of the questions in advance of
the forum which concentrated on the problems of the steel industry.
   ``The point Jesse is making is a very sound one,'' Dukakis said
during a discussion on education. It was typical of the interchange
between the two candidates.
   Asked what promises the candidates would make to the
economically distressed residents of Western Pennsylvania, Dukakis
said: ``I hope the president will sign the new trade bill.''
   Jackson joined in that plea and also said, ``We cannot allow
slave or repressed labor to undercut organized labor. ... So long
as there is slave labor among the coal miners and steelworkers in
South Africa, slave labor will undercut organized labor.''
   Reagan has cited the plant-closing provision as one of his
principal objections to the legislation.
   Jackson also called for creation of an American investment bank
to finance projects to repair the nation's infrastructure. ``A
bridge closes in America every other day,'' he said.
   Earlier in the day, at a stop in Bethlehem, Pa., Dukakis said he
was unsure of whether Jackson has any interest in a No. 2 spot on
the Democratic ticket, a subject which came up at the Friday night
debate.
   ``I asked him if he were interested but he didn't tell me,''
Dukakis said.
   The two rivals began the day campaigning at opposite ends of the
state _ Dukakis in the east and Jackson in the west.
   Campaigning on the Philadelphia waterfront, Dukakis said, ``It's
important that we run a strong and positive campaign. I don't think
the American people are interested in what I think of Jesse Jackson
or what he thinks of me.
   ``They want to know what kind of leadership we're going to
provide for this country.''
   Jackson campaigned by boat, stopping for rallies along the
Monongahela River which runs through Pittsburgh.
   After his strong showing in the New York primary on April 19,
Dukakis was heavily favored to take another jump toward the
nomination when Pennsylvania Democrats vote on Tuesday. At stake in
Pennsylvania were 178 Democratic delegates.
   Pre-primary polls gave Dukakis a big lead among Pennsylvania
Democrats, and he was favored to win the two key contests on
Tuesday _ the presidential preference beauty contest vote and the
separate election of convention delegates.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Centre Daily Times in State
College endorsed Dukakis in their Sunday editions. On Friday,
Dukakis got the endorsement of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, while
Jackson received the support of The Philadelphia Daily News. Many
other newspapers in the state do not plan to endorse a candidate
before the primary.
   Jackson told a crowd of some 500 at the first of his three
riverside rallies that ``leadership does not follow opinion polls,
it molds opinion. It takes the heat.''
   Jackson's Saturday campaigning aboard a sightseeing boat was
aimed at communities struggling to overcome job losses and plant
closings that accompanied the decline of steel making in the
Pittsburgh area.
   In Kansas, meanwhile, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who put
his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on hold
Thursday, scored big gains as the state's Democrats elected
national delegates at congressional district conventions Saturday.
   Dukakis, however, claimed most of the delegates elected, winning
12, while Jackson got seven and Gore five, with two others elected
as uncommitted. That breakdown will dictate how 13 more Kansas
delegates are elected at a meeting of the Democratic State
Convention on May 14, when Dukakis will claim seven more and
Jackson and Gore will split the other six at-large delegates.
   The latest Associated Press delegate count gave Dukakis 1,075.15
and Jackson, the only other active candidate, 836.1. Gore has
427.55 and uncommitted number 599.75. A total of 2,081 was needed
for the nomination.
   In a reminder that there still was a race for the Republican
nomination, however lopsided, Pat Robertson captured the lion's
share of 20 delegates chosen Saturday at the Nevada Republican
Convention.
   The former television evangelist picked up 14 delegates, his
biggest one-day showing so far and his first delegate gain since
Super Tuesday, while Vice President George Bush won four delegates
and another two were elected as uncommitted.
   But the victory still left Robertson more than 1,000 delegates
behind Bush, the all but certain GOP nominee.
   A strong showing in Pennsylvania could boost Bush over the 1,139
delegates needed for the GOP nomination.
   The AP count gave Bush 1,081 and Robertson 31.
   Dukakis was campaigning as if his principal opponent were
overconfidence.
   ``Every single primary is important. Please don't pay any
attention to the polls,'' he told a union audience. ``We need a big
turnout. Everybody has to vote. And you have to vote not only for
me but for my delegates.''
   At nearly every stop he reminded voters that he was leading by
50 points in the polls in 1978 when he lost the Democratic
gubernatorial primary to a far lesser known opponent.
   ``We were all looking at our statistics and we weren't
remembering that it's out on the ball field where you have to win
that game,'' he said.
   At the same time he sounded optimistic about the chances of
taking the White House back from the Republicans.
   ``We're going to take back the presidency for the Democratic
Party and for the country in November. It's out there to be won.
The people of this country are ready for a change. You know and I
know. We hear it every day,'' Dukakis told about 100 people at a
Machinists Union hall in Philadelphia, his second stop Saturday
morning. ``They want an attorney general we can be proud of, not an
attorney general we're embarrassed about.''

   They are more subdued and thoughtful now, their
hair shorter and their waists larger. But 20 years after they shut
down Columbia University, these soulmates of the revolution
remember those heady days with pride.
   ``The moment we had there _ the power we felt, the experience of
turning defeat into victory _ has to be recovered,'' historian Mark
Naison told his classmates, gathered once more at the Morningside
Heights campus for a weekend reunion.
   At panel discussions, a picnic and a party, these veterans of
the campus uprising recalled how about 1,000 people, mostly
students, barricaded themselves inside five campus buildings for
the week of April 23, 1968.
   The protest closed the college and drew international attention
to their opposition to racism, the Vietnam War and the status quo
in general.
   Acting Columbia College Dean Henry Coleman was held hostage.
Professor Orest Ranum lost a decade's research when a protester
torched his files. Protesters Andrea and Richard Egan were married
in occupied Fayerweather Hall by Episcopal chaplain William Starr,
who crawled in through the window.
   After a week, Columbia officials called in the police to clear
the buildings. Nearly 700 people were arrested in brawls between
police and protesters, and 103 people were injured, 85 of them
students or teachers.
   A student strike ensued, and a month later students again
occupied a college building to protest the discipline of protest
leaders; again the police moved in, this time with 68 arrests and
177 injuries.
   ``This reunion is an example of what the university has always
provided _ a forum for the open discussion of ideas,'' said
Columbia spokesman Fred Knubel. ``Reunions can be useful. Looking
back almost always helps us look ahead.''
   Several hundred alumni milled around Earl Hall on Saturday,
wearing bright orange tags that listed the buildings they had
occupied.
   ``This is not the `me generation,''' said Tom Hurwitz of
Manhattan, a free-lance cinematographer. ``Everybody here and
everyone I know is a trace of the good things.''
   Hurwitz recalled ``the incredible unity, a kind of physical
feeling. It was a triumph of morality in a way that morality has
rarely triumphed since.''
   On Saturday, rain forced the picnic inside, after which more
than 500 people listened to a panel of former campus activists
discuss how their lives had been changed by the turbulent era.
   Then everyone adjourned for Chinese food and a party, with
dancing to rock 'n' roll, both old and new.
   ``There's an atmosphere of great camaraderie, people talking
about what they're doing now. It's a general good feeling,'' said
Eric Foner, one of the event's organizers and a graduate student in
1968.
   Dave Crebs, who attended Columbia in the 1970s, said the
informal conversations after the panel discussion were most
interesting.
   ``It's sort of sweet, like people around the campfire,'' said
Crebs, 33, who lives in Boston. ``When I was deciding on college,
people told me, `Don't go to Columbia, they go on strike there.'
And now it turns out all these are all well-meaning, kind folks who
had the best interest of the rest of us at heart.''
   On Friday night, the bluejeans were teamed with a few ties and
sports jackets, a few paunches, and plenty of smiles and embraces
as former soulmates greeted one another at a campus auditorium.
   Buzzwords like ``the perversion of capitalism'' surfaced now and
then. Someone in the balcony unfurled a banner that read, ``Smash
U.S. Imperialist Revolution!''
   ``Up against the wall!'' hollered members of the audience,
invoking the once-familiar phrase to request that a podium be moved
away from the movie screen.
   The crowd applauded Abbie Hoffman, who wore a tie-dyed T-shirt
and sat in the front row, a red bandanna adorning his frizzy gray
hair.
   Hoffman had helped fuel the strikers' conviction, along with Tom
Hayden, now a California assemblyman, black militants H. Rap Brown
and Stokely Carmichael, civil rights lawyer William Kunstler, poet
Allen Ginsberg and the Grateful Dead rock band.
   Many recollections were serious. A few brought laughter:
   _A pie tossed in the face of a Marine colonel recruiting on
campus.
   _Naison taking his Ph.D. oral exam in a building that was under
occupation. He passed the exam, and his professors exited through a
window.
   ``It was not a prank or a party, although many have described it
as the best time of their lives,'' said Mark Rudd of Albuquerque,
N.M., who was chairman of Students for a Democratic Society in 1968.
   In the old days, ``We were kids; smart kids _ but kids,'' said
ex-protester Nancy Biberman, 40, now a New York City housing lawyer
with two children of her own. ``One of the nice things about
getting older is that it does mellow some of the hard edges around
the anger.''
   As students, Rudd said, the protesters were ``intolerant,
arrogant, driven and out of touch with reality. Our rage blinded
us. ... We allowed the evil we were fighting to penetrate our
souls.''
   ``We failed to create a permanent, significant left in the
U.S.,'' Rudd said. Even so, he still is protesting _ this time
against U.S. involvement in Central America _ and is writing his
autobiography.

   Leftist guerrillas assassinated two mayors in
mountainous Arequipa state, officials said Saturday, bringing to
five the number of Peruvian mayors slain by Maoist insurgents in
the past three weeks.
   Andres Neyra of Choco and Daniel Lopez of Ayo were killed Friday
by members of the Shining Path rebel group, said Fernan Fernandez,
an Arequipa municipal official.
   Fernandez said the victims were slain in their homes by the
guerrillas, but he said other details were unavailable.
   Choco and Ayo are hamlets in the province of Castilla, 118 miles
northeast of the state capital.
   The government says more than 10,000 people have been killed
since the Maoist Shining Path began its violent campaign to
overthrow the government eight years ago.
   Officials said previously that rebels on Friday shot to death
the mayor of Socabaya, 545 miles southeast of Lima. On Thursday,
gunmen killed the mayor of the Macachacra, 210 miles southeast of
the capital.
   On April 13, the mayor of Andajes and four other local officials
were slain in the town 75 miles north of Lima.

   Strong thunderstorms developed Saturday over the South, with wet
weather scattered over the rest of the eastern half of the nation,
and lightning injured nine people during heavy rain in southern
California.
   Large hail fell in Mississippi, with ice chunks the size of
nickels at Lauderdale, as big as quarters in western Kemper County
and as big as golf balls at Bailey.
   Jackson, Miss., got 2.03 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2
p.m. EDT.
   Alabama also got hail as big as dimes at Selma, Marion and
Demopolis, the size of nickels at York and the diameter of quarters
at Cuba.
   High wind during thunderstorms downed power lines at Prattville,
Ala., the National Weather Service said.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed along a cold front
pushing through the Ohio Valley and the lower Mississippi Valley,
extending from southern Arkansas into southern Indiana and western
Kentucky.
   The cold front created a sharp contrast in temperatures across
Michigan. Temperatures across much of the state were in the 30s but
approached 80 degrees in the southeastern corner.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended from Maryland to New
York during the afternoon.
   Showers also produced rain and snow over much of the upper Great
Lakes, and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., got 3 inches of snow during the
six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Locally heavy rain fell on southern California, with heavy snow
at higher elevations.
   Eight girls and one adult were injured by lightning when they
huddled under a tree at a softball field to escape a sudden
downpour near Tustin. They were taken to local hospitals where
officials said their injuries ranged from minor to moderate.
   Rain fell at a rate of a half-inch an hour in the lower
mountains of Los Angeles County and water overflowed curbs on some
downtown Los Angeles streets.
   Elsewhere in southern California, heavy snow fell in the Frazier
Mountain area of Ventura County and snow advisories were issued for
elevations above 5,000 feet, the weather service said. Two inches
of snow was reported on Mount Wilson in the San Gabriel Mountains
and Pine Mountain in Kern County.
   Farther north, showers extended across Washington state into
western Montana
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 100 at McAllen, Texas. The low for the day was 11 degrees
at Chadron, Neb.
   For Sunday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from central
Oklahoma and eastern Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast into
northern Florida, with thunderstorms most likely over the Carolinas
and the central Gulf Coast states.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were forecast over the lower
Great Lakes region and the middle and northern Atlantic Coast, with
rain likely in the northern Atlantic Coast region. Scattered
showers were forecast from the northern Pacific Coast to the
central Rockies and the northern high Plains. A few showers were
forecast over the north-central states.
   Highs in the 40s were predicted in Upper Michigan and northern
Maine; in the 50s from Washington and northern Oregon through the
northern and central Rockies to New England; in the 70s from the
southern half of California through the Rio Grande Valley to the
middle Atlantic Coast; and in the 80s from south-central Texas to
the southern Atlantic Coast, and in the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>Bakker Renews Call To Return To Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker renewed his call Saturday to
be allowed to return to PTL to help erase its debts, but ministry
officials blamed the former television evangelist for the
revocation of its tax-exempt status and other financial problems.
   The Internal Revenue Service revoked PTL's exemption Friday and
said contributions to the organization were no longer tax
deductible.
   The IRS said Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker and their aides profited
excessively from donations to the ministry. The agency also said
much of PTL's Heritage USA theme park in Fort Mill was commercial
rather than ministerial.
   Bakker, in a telephone call to The Associated Press from his
home in Palm Springs, Calif., acknowledged that he made mistakes,
but he denied taking excessive profits and said contributions he
convinced people to send built PTL's evangelical empire.
   ``It's typical of the IRS. They throw everything at you but the
kitchen sink and then ask you to sort it out with documents and
vouchers and receipts and defend yourself,'' Bakker said.
   Bakker said PTL faces liquidation, so its current leadership
should give him another chance.
   ``Now that it's reached the end of the line and will be broken
up, what do they have to lose,'' Bakker said.
   Bakker resigned as leader of the ministry in March 1987 in the
midst of a scandal over his sexual encounter with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn in 1980.
   PTL trustee David Clark has said he has no intention of letting
Bakker return.
   Ministry officials probably will announce on Monday's ``PTL
Club'' television show their response to the IRS action, PTL
attorney Bradford Leggett said.
   If PTL appeals, contributions by individuals would be deductible
up to $1,000 until the appeal is decided, the IRS said.
   ``This ruling could have an impact on contributions if people
don't keep their focus on the fact that what we are dealing with
here is a legacy that was left by the Bakkers,'' Leggett said.
   PTL has applied for a new tax-exempt charter and wants to
legally separate its ministry functions _ the daily TV show,
satellite network and Heritage Village Church _ from its theme park
and hotel. There was no indication when the IRS would rule.
   The IRS says PTL owes more than $55 million in taxes from June
1983 to June 1987, the month PTL filed for protection from
creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court because of $72 million in other
debts..
   Meanwhile, the Rev. Jerry Falwell on Saturday criticized the IRS
ruling as a ``knee-jerk reaction'' that ``has guaranteed the demise
of the ministry.''
   Falwell, who headed PTL briefly after Bakker stepped down, said
in a speech to the North Carolina Associated Press Broadcasters
Association that the IRS should have revoked PTL's exemption only
for the years Bakker headed the ministry.

   Woman who admitted drowning her colicky
two-month-old son was under a court-ordered suicide watch in jail
Saturday because of fears that the might take her own life.
   Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Micki Scherer ordered the suicide
watch during Lucrezia Gentile's arraignment Friday on a charge of
second-degree murder in the death of her son Stephen.
   The order ``means a correction officer checks on her every 15
minutes,'' said Ruby Ryles, spokeswoman for the city Department of
Correction.
   The judge set bail at $75,000 and told Mrs. Gentile she may not
have unsupervised visits with her 7-year-old son, John Jr.
   Mrs. Gentile, 36, was arrested after admitting she lied when she
told police her son was snatched from her on the street by
kidnappers.
   Police said she admitted drowning the baby in the bathtub
Wednesday morning, dressing him, putting him in a plastic garbage
bag and dumped him in a trash can two blocks from her home.
   Police said her husband, John, a 32-year-old U.S. marshal, knew
nothing about circumstances of the child's death.
   Her lawyer, John DePaola, said she suffered from postpartum
depression. He said she had run up about $20,000 in medical bills
after having surgery to correct an infertility problem, then she
had gone through a difficult pregnancy.

   A Greek cycling champion pedaled a fragile
plane 74 miles over the Aegean sea Saturday and broke the world
record for human-powered flight, but the aircraft was destroyed in
a crash landing.
   A gust of wind snapped the tail boom off the ultralight Daedalus
88, which crashed into the sea just 10 yards short of the landing
area on the island of Santorini more than 3{ hours after leaving
the island of Crete.
   ``It happened in the last moments of the flight and the job was
done. I didn't worry about it,'' the athlete-pilot Kanellos
Kanellopoulos told a news conference in the Greek capital. He was
not injured in the crash.
   ``The situation in the landing area was too rough for this
plane, which is built for calm conditions. I was under full control
but the tail boom couldn't take the pressure,'' said Kanellopoulos,
who also broke the records for endurance and straight-line
human-powered flight.
   Kanellopoulos, 31, Greek cycling champion for the past 14 years,
was flown to Athens aboard an army helicopter shortly after the
rough landing near the black sands of Perissa beach on the
southeast face of the volcanic island also known as Thira.
   The 72-pound graphite epoxy and mylar plane, designed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, fell after hitting a wind
parallel to the beach, said MIT professor Mark Drela, who was in
one of the boats following the flight.
   But Drela, the senior engineer responsible for the plane's
aerodynamic design, said the project was ``definitely a success.''
   More than 500 islanders and foreign tourists gathered along the
beach to watch the plane, resembling an oversized insect, glide
toward the sand.
   The snapped tail boom caused the plane's huge 112-foot long
wings to break, dropping the pink-and-silver aircraft 10 feet into
the water.
   ``I was underwater so I forced my way through the cockpit and
dove under the plane. Then I swam to shore,'' the tanned, blond
cyclist said.
   Kanellopoulos pumped the pedals in the nose of the aircraft for
3 hours and 54 minutes to fly from Heraklion air base to Santorini.
   He lifted off at 7:06 a.m. (12:06 a.m. EDT) and landed at 11:00
a.m. (4 a.m. EDT).
   The flight was intended to emulate the 3,500-year-old myth of
Daedalus, a Greek architect, sculptor and engineer who flapped his
way across the Aegean from Crete on wings of feathers and wax.
Daedalus' son, Icarus, flew too close to the sun, which melted the
wax, causing him to to fall to his death.
   The previous world record for human-powered flight was set by
the Light Eagle, a Daedalus 88 prototype piloted by Glenn Tremml,
who flew 37.2 miles around Edwards Air Base in California in
January 1987.
   Kanellopoulos also shattered the record for straight-line
human-powered flight set in 1979 by Bryan Allen, who pedaled the
Gossamer Albatross 22{ miles across the English Channel.
   The third record broken was for flight duration. The previous
mark was held by Allen, with a time of 2 hours, 49 minutes.
   Greek navy and coast guard vessels along with inflatable rescue
craft had escorted the plane as it soared 15 feet above the Aegean.
   The flight came after a 36-member team of MIT experts waited for
three weeks on the wind-swept island of Crete for a suitable day to
attempt the flight.
   Essential requirements were a calm sea, southerly winds of less
than 3 knots, temperatures under 70 degress Fahrenheit and
visibility to the horizon, according to Steve K. Bussolari, an MIT
aeronautics professor in charge of flight operations.
   ``Conditions for the flight were ideal. We even had a southerly
tailwind,'' Bussolari said.
   The southerly tailwind pushed the Daedalus 88 over the Agean
waters at a rate faster than expected by the MIT team, with the
plane averaging 18.5 miles per hour, team officials said. They had
not expected the ungainly flying machine to go over 14 miles per
hour.
   ``We were predicting the low speeds because we had been
estimating headwinds, which are prevalent. We have no idea where
the tailwinds came from,'' said project news director Ken Campbell.
   In addition to Kanellopoulos, three other athlete-pilots had
been standing by for 48 hours each in readiness for a possible
record flight.
   They were Francis Scioscia, 27, of Scranton, Pa., Greg Zack, 26,
of Wilmington, N.C., and 27-year-old Tremml, the former
world-record holder and a medical student from New Haven, Conn.

<HEAD>Reagan Picking Federal Judge for Appeals Court, Wilson Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan will appoint Los Angeles
federal judge Pamela Ann Rymer to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals seat vacated by Anthony M. Kennedy, it was disclosed.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Friday that Reagan had picked
Rymer, now a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, to fill the
seat left in November when Kennedy was named to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   Wilson will nominate U.S. Attorney Robert C. Bonner of Los
Angeles to replace Rymer, said Wilson aide Bill Livingstone.
   The formal announcement of Rymer's nomination to the appellate
court is expected from the White House next week, Livingstone said.
Both appointments must be confirmed by the Senate.
   Rymer, 46, known for her stiff sentences, is a lifelong
Republican and she was on a list of candidates for the U.S. Supreme
Court before Reagan settled on Kennedy last year.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considering Using Coast Guard Vessels in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deployment of Coast Guard vessels in the
Persian Gulf has been raised again at the Pentagon, a Defense
Department official confirmed Saturday night.
   ``It was the brainchild of the commandant of the Coast Guard
last year and it went nowhere,'' said the official, who asked that
he not be identified by name. ``It was raised again last week. I
don't know how serious it is.''
   A Defense Department spokesman, Maj. Randy Morger, said he had
no information on the report.
   The New York Times said in its Sunday editions that the Coast
Guard vessels would assist larger warships in escorting merchant
vessels, keeping watch over sea lanes to prevent the laying of
mines and guarding offshore installations from attacks by small
craft.
   The vessels also would free larger ships from routine patrols,
the paper said.
   The Times quoted unidentified Pentagon officials as saying they
did not know how many or precisely what kind of Coast Guard vessels
would be sent if Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci approved the plan.
   The Coast Guard is eager to assume a role in the gulf
operations, officials told the Times.
   The idea of using Coast Guard vessels had been proposed last
October but was rejected by then Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
   The Reagan administration expanded its naval presence in the
Persian Gulf last summer at the request of Kuwait, an ally of Iraq
in the 7{-year Iran-Iraq war which had seen its tankers become
special targets of Iranian attack.
   President Reagan, saying it was essential to protect freedom of
navigation in international waters, announced the Navy would
protect any Kuwaiti-owned tankers that were re-registered to fly
the U.S. flag. Ultimately, 11 Kuwaiti ships were re-flagged.
   On Friday, administration officials said the Reagan
administration has decided to expand its policy to allow U.S.
warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack.
   The change resulted from the mining of the U.S. frigate Samuel
B. Roberts on April 14 and last Monday's extensive fighting between
Iranian and U.S. forces, the officials said.
   In that fighting, U.S. forces sank or crippled six Iranian
vessels that challenged them after they destroyed two offshore
platforms in retaliation for the mining of the Roberts.
   Despite the change in policy, the Pentagon hopes that it can
avoid the assignment of additional ships to the gulf, the officials
said.
   The Pentagon recently has deployed the following numbers and
types of ships in the Persian Gulf: two command ships, one cruiser,
one destroyer, six frigates, six mine-sweepers, and an amphibious
landing ship.
   The department announced last week that the Navy was deploying
13 ships to the gulf region but said it was part of a long-planned
and routine series of rotations. Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said
he announced the ship movements to head off speculation that the
United States had decided to increase the size of its Middle East
force.

   Rescue workers searching through the rubble
of a grain elevator Saturday found the bodies of the last of five
people killed in an explosion a day earlier, police said.
   Three bodies were discovered within half an hour of each other
late Saturday afternoon by rescue workers digging through debris,
corn and soybeans in the basement of the elevator, said police
detective Alan Horvath.
   ``There were five people unaccounted for and we have recovered
all five,'' said Joliet Police Captain James Grace.
   The three victims apparently had been in an office area of the
elevator when it exploded and were found under ``a whole roomful of
grain,'' Grace said.
   Authorities at first believed that another person had been blown
into the river from a barge by the force of the explosion, but
Grace said they no longer believe that report.
   He added, however, that rescue workers are continuing their
search in the area ``just as a precaution.''
   Two bodies were recovered Friday after the two explosions
flattened four solos and an office building at the ADM Growmark
granary, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago.
   ``This is just one of those tragic things that should never
happen,'' said Dan Stewart, whose 20-year-old son, Mark, was killed
in Friday's explosions.
   ``He was a good son, and I loved him,'' said Stewart, a farmer
from Anchor, Ill., whose son had been a trainee at the site as part
of a program at Joliet Junior College.
   The tragedy was especially horrifying for the family of Dale
Brent Slatton, 28, of Newark, Ill., whose younger brother was
killed in a car accident 10 months ago.
   ``It's totally devastating to have three sons and to lose two,''
said the victim's mother, Carol. ``To lose any is a tragedy. ...
Now, this is something we have to go through again.''
   After toiling overnight, workers using bulldozers and cranes had
cleared about 50 percent of the debris strewn over the site by the
explosions, said an official at the Joliet Police command post at
the site who would not identify himself.
   Authorities suspect grain dust may have caused the first
explosion, which apparently ruptured a natural gas main about 11
a.m. and touched off a second blast moments later, said Joliet Fire
Chief George Plese.
   But Plese said Saturday that the exact cause would be hard to
determine.
   ``We have no idea what caused the explosions ... and due to that
much destruction it will be very hard to try to pinpoint anything,
but we're going to try to make that attempt,'' he said.
   The bodies recovered Saturday were identified as those of Donald
E. Zack of Joliet, Daniel McLaughlin, 18, of Manhattan and Michael
Dupuis, 23, of Bourbonnais, said Will County Deputy Coroner William
Ferguson.
   David Munchalfen, a security guard, said there had been four
silos at the site, and only a sheet-metal covered grain dryer
remained standing. One of the silos crushed an adjacent one-story
office building.

   A rooftop parking area
collapsed Saturday during the grand opening of a grocery store,
dropping automobiles and blocks of concrete onto store displays and
injuring 21 people, police said.
   It was not immediately known how many people were in the
Save-on-Foods store when the parking area, holding about 22 autos,
collapsed, but Constable Lloyd Wall of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police in Burnaby said estimates ran as high as 900. Many were
elderly people being given a preview tour.
   Three of the injured were admitted to hospitals, with one in
serious condition.
   Police used cranes to remove huge blocks of concrete and cars
that fell about 40 feet from the parking area to the floor of the
store, in the Metrotown shopping center, Mounted Police Constable
Dave Muir said.
   It took several hours for searchers, who used police dogs, to
get through the rubble. Officials believed everyone was accounted
for, Wall said.
   ``We're being optimistic there won't be any deaths,'' said
Mounted Police Sgt. Gary Schauer. ``But we're still going through
the rubble.''
   Some cars were piled on each other on the supermarket floor amid
soda and produce displays, while above, other autos teetered on the
edge of a hole about half the size of a football field.
   ``I heard a crack and I looked up and saw the center beam wobble
and saw the floor from the parking garage come down so I
immediately told people to get outside,'' said one witness, George
Sanderson.
   ``As soon as the first crack came (in the beam), they started
getting people out,'' Heppell said.
   The collapse was preceded by the sound of a buckling beam and
spray from a bursting water pipe, officials said. There were three
warnings over the store's loudspeaker system to clear the area.
   Clarence Heppell, president of Overwaitea Foods, which operates
the store chain, said a structural failure caused the cave-in.
   Eight people were taken to a hospital by ambulance, and others
went to emergency wards on their own.
   ``The staff was well-organized but we had some problems with the
customers,'' said meatcutter John Hill, 38. ``They didn't appear to
be trying to move too fast.
   ``They were still checking out our prices. It's amazing how some
people react.''
   Free-lance photographer Robert Klein, who was taking pictures of
the preview event, said many thought it was a joke that a water
pipe should burst in a brand new supermarket.
   ``Then I could see that the roof was bent and old this older man
that the roof was going to go.
   ``I'd just turned my back for one second and down it came. There
was suddenly a tremendous gust of wind at my back as I ran,'' he
said. ``Suddenly everybody was in shock. Everybody was stunned. And
some of the people were really freaked out.''

<HEAD>Congressional Report Says Star Wars Would Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unpublished congressional report says
President Reagan's proposed missile defense system known as Star
Wars likely would ``suffer a catastrophic failure'' the first time
it was used, the Washington Post reported Sunday.
   The first time would therefore be the only time it was used to
protect the United States against a Soviet nuclear attack, the
newspaper said.
   The Post said the conclusions are contained in a report by the
Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan scientific arm of
the Congress which studied Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative
for the past two years.
   The OTA says in the report that the detailed computer
instructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streaking
towards the United States probably cannot ``be produced in the
foreseeable future,'' according to the newspaper, which said it
obtained a copy of the report's summary chapter.
   The Post said the report also says that the timetable for
missile defense deployment in the mid-1990s established by SDI
officials requires ``an act of faith'' in assuming that the system
could indefinitely stop a substantial portion of Soviet missiles
because there is no scientific evidence to date to support the
assumption.
   The conclusions are among the principal findings of a 900-page
report on SDI prepared by the OTA's staff, which was given access
to classified SDI data and drew advice from an expert panel
containing SDI supporters and opponents.
   Public release of an unclassified version of the report has been
withheld for seven months by Pentagon officials, who say it
contains sensitive information, the paper said. Although three of
the report's chapters remain in dispute, SDI officials last month
cleared nine others, including the summary chapter obtained by the
Post.
   The OTA report's overall conclusion is that, despite five years
and $12 billion worth of scientific research, ``many questions
remain about the feasibility of meeting SDI goals,'' which include
at the outset substantial disruption of a Soviet missile attack and
in later stages, ``elimination of the threat posed'' by Soviet
missiles, the paper said.
   Noting that the nation ``would not want to base a major change
in its nuclear strategy on a (missile defense) ... in which it had
little confidence,'' the OTA report cautioned that the system's
sheer complexity suggested ``there would always be irresolvable
questions about how dependable ... (the computer) software was.''
the Post said.
   ``Extrapolating from past experience ... it appears to OTA that
the complexity of (ballistic missile defense), the uncertainty ...
of the requirements it must meet, and the novelty of the technology
it must control would impose a significant probability of
software-induced catastrophic failure in the system's first real
battle,'' the newspaper quoted the report as saying.

a cockpit indicator light showed a problem with a hydraulic line, a
Continental spokesman said.
   The light came on shortly after takeoff Thursday night from
Newark International Airport, and the pilot requested permission to
return to Newark as a precaution to have fixed the line, which
serves an engine, spokesman Ned Walker said at company headquarters
in Houston.
   The line was replaced, and the 747 jet went on to London, he

   Just a week after announcing plans for a half-hour
nightly news program, the Christian Science Monitor says it will
publish a new monthly magazine, ``World Monitor.''
   The first issue of the glossy, four-color monthly will appear in
September, at the same time the TV show begins. The magazine will
include articles on world news, politics, the arts, economics,
culture and personalities with what is described as a ``global
focus.''
   ``We're hoping to throw a life preserver to people who are
drowning in a tidal wave of facts, info, dis-info and mis-info,''
said ``World Monitor'' Editor in Chief Earl Foell, who is also
editor of the Christian Science Monitor, flagship of the Christian
Science Publishing Society.
   Gary Thompson, associate publisher of ``World Monitor,'' said
marketing studies found there was a demand for the ``big-picture''
journalism that both the television show and magazine will offer.
   ``We saw that the newsweekly concept was being covered well but
that many people wanted more than headline type news,'' said
Thompson.
   In addition to the newspaper, magazine and TV show, the
Christian Science Monitor also offers radio news programming and a
worldwide radio shortwave radio system.
   Thompson said Monitor executives hope to make a profit with the
magazine, which will have a newsstand price of $2.50. The Christian
Science Monitor newspaper, with a circulation of about 200,000, has
lost money for years.

   A woman whose 2-year-old son died of

Friday to a maximum seven years in prison for manslaughter.
   Mark Mahon, attorney for Delores Lynn Blok, had asked Circuit
Judge David C. Wiggins to order probation and allow Mrs. Blok to

   Assistant State Attorneys Bernie de la Rionda and Lance Day

Aug. 2 was criminal negligence.
   The temperature that day was 92 degrees, and climbed to 115
degrees in the car, officials said. The child's body temperature
was 108 degrees when he was taken to Baptist Medical Center.
   Mrs. Blok said she she left the boy the the car when she went to
visit a friend because he was asleep.
   Wiggins ordered Mrs. Blok to report to prison Monday.

   One of the men who crawled beneath
crushed cement to search for survivors in the collapse of the
L'Ambiance Plaza building now is looking for a job on a rescue team.
   Tony Tufaro, nicknamed ``the Mole'' during the nine-day rescue
attempt that began April 23, 1987, was one of the short, wiry men
who tied ropes around themselves, crawled under the ruins and
searched in vain for survivors.
   Twenty-eight men were killed in the collapse; 14 were injured.
   Tufaro has a scrapbook full of newspaper clippings about his
rescue efforts, but he doesn't have what he wants most _ a job with
a rescue team.
   Tufaro, 25, completed a course in firefighter training in
November at the Southeast Florida Academy of Fire Science, paid for
by a $1,200 donation from a Bridgeport bank.
   He works as a carpenter, the kind of job he held before the
collapse.
   He has contacted an aide to Gov. William A. O'Neill to ask when
the state will set up a disaster response team. He said he was told
that thg team will be set up when funds are available.
   Tufaro said the L'Ambiance tragedy enabled him to discover what
he wants to do with his life, but he said he is frustrated because
he can't find a job.

   A Japanese man who is a suspected terrorist
was indicted Friday for allegedly carrying pipe bombs on the New
Jersey Turnpike, officials said.
   Yu Kikumura, 35, was charged with three counts of interstate
transport of explosive devices, three counts of possessing
unregistered explosive devices and three of possession of
explosives by an illegal alien, U.S. Attorney Samuel Alito said.
   Kikumura, identified by the Japanese Foreign Ministry as a
suspected member of the terrorist Red Army group, also was charged
with one count each of having an illegal passport, a fradulent visa
and the passport of another person, Alito said.
   The charges together carry a prison term of up to 90 years.
   Kikumura was arrested April 12 at a service area on the turnpike
in Ridgefield after a state trooper found the sophisticated
homemade bombs and falsified papers, authorities said.
   Officials said Kikumura used a passport stolen from a Japanese
hospital worker to obtain a U.S. entry visa. He entered the country
March 8, authorities said.
   Ronald Kuby, who along with William Kunstler is defending
Kikumura, said he found the number of charges incredible.
   ``You've taken a straightforward single offense, multiplied it,
pyramided it until you face a century in jail,'' Kuby said. ``He is
being indicted for what the government thinks he is rather than
what he has done.''
   Kikumura is being held without bail in the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in New York. Arraignment was scheduled April 29.

Washington report of new orders for Navy in gulf</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Navy mine sweepers detonated mines
Friday that were found earlier in the week near an offshore Iranian
oil platform in the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon and shipping
executives reported.
   In another development, officials in Washington said the Reagan
administration has decided to permit Navy warships in the gulf to
intervene with force to help neutral merchant vessels that are
attacked. Their orders have been to offer only humanitarian
assistance.
   Shipping executives said three mines were detonated Friday but
Pentagon officials in Washington, speaking privately, said mine
sweepers examined and destroyed five mines. They said the
explosives carried serial numbers indicating Iran manufactured them.
   The mines were spotted by a French warship Tuesday near the
Sassan oil platform about 80 miles from the Qatar peninsula. The
area was declared a navigational hazard and commercial vessels were
warned to stay away.
   Sassan is one of two Iranian platforms the Navy destroyed Monday
in retaliation for a mine explosion that damaged the frigate Samuel
B. Roberts last week and wounded 10 sailors.
   The Navy and other nations' mine sweepers have worked all week
to clear a mine field about 70 miles northeast of where the mines
were detonated Friday.
   That field is in a main shipping channel for reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers escorted by U.S. warships.
   Escort operations, which began last July, have been suspended
until the mines are cleared. At least three of the 11 Kuwaiti
tankers given American flags and registration were anchored outside
the gulf Friday.
   Under the new U.S. policy, Navy ships no longer would be
instructed to stay away when Iran attacks merchant ships sailing
under other flags.
   If a Navy warship observed an Iranian raid and was close enough
to intervene it would have the authority to do so, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's a random,
target-of-opportunity approach designed to throw the Iranians off
guard,'' one said.
   A Capitol Hill official briefed on the matter Friday said:
``This will give a lot of authority to local commanders and a lot
of leeway to do as they see fit.''
   Another official said: ``Our purpose is not to get into a war
with Iran. Our purpose is to secure safe passage for neutral
shipping moving back and forth between neutral ports.''
   They said the policy change does not extend U.S. military
protection to convoys of foreign-flag ships. Only ships flying the
American flag will be entitled to ``door-to-door protection'' in
convoys, one official said.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Talks On Bering Sea Adjourn With No Moratorium
Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week of U.S.-Soviet talks on the Bering Sea
fishery that included discussion of a possible ban on fishing in
the so-called ``doughnut hole,'' ended Friday with only a promise
of additional meetings.
   ``It was a good first meeting,'' said Edward Wolfe, the State
Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries who headed the
U.S. delegation. ``We agreed this was going to be an exploratory
meeting and we exchanged views.''
   Wolfe said no agreement was reached on a fishing moratorium in
the ``doughnut hole,'' a 4,500-square mile area in the center of
the Bering Sea that is one of the richest fishing grounds in the
world.
   Wolfe declined further comment, adding only that such a fishing
ban was discussed.
   ``We will continue to discuss this issue,'' said Wolfe, adding
that he would brief members of Congress next week.
   The two sides agreed to meet again in Moscow later this spring.
   Wolfe said the Soviet Union shares U.S. concerns that foreign
trawlers may be overfishing the ``doughnut hole'' and that could
cause a decline in the catch in the American and Soviet fishing
zones that surround the area.
   The catch by foreign vessels, including those from Japan, South
Korea, China and Poland, has risen from roughly 200,000 metric tons
in 1984 to more than 1 million metric tons in 1987.
   According to a joint statement issued after the negotiations
ended, both sides agreed to ``develop further cooperation between
the United States and the Soviet Union and the exercise of their

   Earlier this year, the Senate overhwelmingly approved a
resolution calling on the State Department to negotiate a fishing
moratorium in the ``doughnut hole.''
   The Senate vote came in the wake of the videotapping by American
fishermen of seven Japanese trawlers fishing illegally in U.S.
waters off Alaska.

   The Soviet Union on Friday accused Israel
of state terrorism in the assassination of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military commander.
   ``It is but another example of Israel's cynical contempt for
world public opinion,'' Soviet Ambassador Alexander Belonogov told
the Security Council.
   Belonogov also called the slaying ``another act of the policy of
state terrorism which has long been practiced by Israel.''
   Tunisia, which requested the council meeting, wants Israel
condemned for the assassination of Khalil Wazir at his home in
suburban Tunis last Saturday.
   Tunisian officials and Israeli sources say Israeli commandos
gunned down Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad. Officially, Israel has
neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.
   In a carefully worded statement issued Thursday by the Israeli
mission to the United Nations, the Jewish state denied it
``admitted'' the attack, as Tunisia claimed.
   The Soviets joined a growing list of nations condemning Israel
for the assassination. Most have singled it out by name. A few,
such as Britain and France, have not.
   Japan's ambassador, Hideo Kagami, noted the absence of firm
proof against Israel. Kagami said any condemnation ``must be based
on solid and irrefutable evidence.''
   Many diplomats said they expected United States to veto
Tunisia's resolution, as it has several resolutions on the unrest
considered by the council recently.
   They said the U.S. vote hinged on the wording of the resolution.
A direct condemnation of Israel was sure to be vetoed, but a
general condemnation of political assassination might survive, said
the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A vote was expected Monday. Dozens of nations have joined the
debate, including many accused of sponsoring terrorism, such as
Libya.
   Many speakers told the council the slaying further hampers the
prospects of a settlement between Israel and Arab neighbors.
   ``The shots in Tunisia are shots against peace in the Middle
East,'' said Yugoslav Ambassador Dragoslav Pejic.
   A number of speakers told Israel that Wazir's death will not end
the Palestinian unrest since Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip that has left 171 Palestinians and two Israelis dead.
   Wazir, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, was the PLO coordinator
for the uprising.
   The PLO has issued orders for a ``Day of Rage'' in the
Israeli-occupied terrorities Saturday to avenge Wazir, according to
a leaflet circulating in the area.

<HEAD>Report Government Inquiry Ends On Border Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports Friday said an Irish
government investigation has concluded that an unarmed civilian
fatally wounded near a British army checkpoint in Northern Ireland
was killed by a ricocheting bullet.
   The Justice Ministry would not confirm the report.
   Dublin's Irish Press newspaper quoted police sources as saying
the investigation found that a ricocheting bullet killed Aidan
McAnespie, 23, on Feb. 21 at the checkpoint in Northern Ireland
near the border with the Irish Republic.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, also quoted
police sources as saying the inquiry had determined that the
shooting was not deliberate. The British army has said it was an
accident.
   Britain was angered by the decision by the Irish government to
investigate the shooting, calling it interference in the affairs of
Northern Ireland, a British province.
   An 18-year-old British soldier, Pvt. David Holden, is being held
in military custody while awaiting trial on charges of unlawfully
killing McAnespie.
   Irish police spokesman Martin Casey told The Associated Press
that the investigation headed by Deputy Irish Police Chief Eugene
Crowley had been concluded but he could not comment on its results.
   A spokesman for Irish Justice Minister Gerry Collins said
Collins had been given the report and ``it will be considered by
the Cabinet at a future date.''
   The shooting occurred at a checkpoint near Auchnacloy, a County
Tyrone town half a mile from the border.
   McAnespie was an election worker for Sinn Fein, the legal
political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. The British
army said he was killed by a ricocheting bullet after a machine gun
was fired accidentally from the observation post.
   McAnespie's family and Roman Catholic leaders in Northern
Ireland claimed that McAnespie had been regularly harassed by
British soldiers on his way to and from work across the border.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey challenged the army's
version, saying the suggestion that the shooting was an accident
``must give rise to disbelief.''
   The mainly Catholic IRA is battling to unite Northern Ireland,
where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly
Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Surrogate Mother Of Twins Says Couple Told Her: Keep The Boy</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto DT8</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IONIA, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patty Nowakowski says she agreed to be a
surrogate mother and gave birth to a boy and a girl, only to find
that the couple wanted just the girl.
   Now the twins, not yet 3 weeks old, live separately because the
couple who hired her didn't want the boy. After some hesitation,
she and her husband, Aaron, have decided to raise the boy
themselves and have named him Arthur Jay.
   Nowakowski, 27, told her story this week to a special
legislative panel looking into surrogacy contracts.
   ``I was not aware of how carelessly the program is run,'' the
woman said. ``When I entered into it, I thought it would be a
wonderful thing to do for someone else, to help them have a family.
I never dreamed it would turn out this way.''
   The babies were born under a $10,000 contract arranged by Noel
Keane, a Dearborn attrney who specializes in surrogate birth
agreements. Keane arranged Mary Beth Whitehead's surrogate
pregnancy, which resulted in a protracted legal battle in New
Jersey known as the ``Baby M'' case.
   Keane said he did not know of a couple ever having rejected a
surrogate baby because of its sex, and would not discuss the
specifics of the Nowakowski contract.
   Nowakowski was given fertility drugs and became pregnant at the
first artificial insemination last July.
   She said she learned she was carrying twins, and underwent a
procedure to determine the sex of the babies. The test showed that
one baby was a boy, but the sex of the other could not be
determined.
   Two weeks before the twins were born, the other couple, who
already had children, told her a doctor had recommended against
adding more children to their family because of the added stress.
   ``They had decided they did not want the boy,'' Nowakowski said
in an interview Thursday with The Grand Rapids Press. But the
couple told her that if the other baby was a girl, they would take
her.
   ``At that point, I did not know what to do. I was very angry,''
Nowakowski said. ``It put us in a bad position.''
   Nowakowski said she and her husband, who have three other
children, thought they would put up the babies for adoption if they
were both boys. When the babies were born in a Lansing hospital,
the couple came and took the baby girl. The boy was sent to a
foster home.
   But that bothered Nowakowski, and she and her husband ended up
taking Arthur Jay home.
   ``It didn't seem fair to him, that he was rejected by his
biological father, then rejected again by his surrogate parents.
How can you make a child enter the world as a product of
rejection?''

   Spring had come to Moscow and Soviet officials
were busy observing the birthday of Vladimir I. Lenin, so George P.
Shultz went shopping. The secretary of state, accompanied by U.S.
Ambassador Jack Matlock and security aides, went Friday afternoon
to the Cheremushkinsky farmers' market and then visited the Old
Arbat pedestrian mall in central Moscow.
   At the mall, Shultz liked a landscape painting displayed against
a wall.
   The artist, Sergei Vasiliev, offered to give it to the visiting
American as a present, but Shultz thanked him and paid 100 rubles,
about $165, for the painting.
   Shultz was in Moscow for talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.

<HEAD>Peru and Ecuador Protest Coup Statement by U.S. Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry on Friday demanded an
explanation from the U.S. government after a State Department
official was quoted as saying that Peru and Ecuador face the threat
of military coups.
   Ecuador's interior minister, Heinz Moeller, also assailed the
statements attributed to Elliot Abrams, assistant secretary of
state for Latin American affairs, that were published in the
Argentine newspaper La Nacion earlier this week.
   La Nacion said that in the interview conducted in Buenos Aires,
Abrams was asked about threats to fragile Latin American
democracies. It quoted him as saying that in meetings with Latin
American leaders he is frequently told that Peru and Ecuador are
the most worrisome cases.
   Peru's Foreign Ministry issued a communique saying it has
``presented its protest and solicited an explanation'' from the
United States involving statements made in Buenos Aires two days
previously ``regarding the existence of dangers of a coup in Peru.''
   It added: ``Apart from being intrinsically erroneous, those
declarations constitute inadmissible interference in internal
matters that deserves our energetic rejection.''
   Moeller said Thursday, ``Mr. Abrams is damaging the democratic
process with his declarations.''
   There was no comment from the U.S. embassies in Lima and Quito.
   There are occasional rumors of possible coups in both Andean
nations, which are suffering severe economic problems. Peru also is
battling left-wing rebels in a revolt that has claimed more than
10,000 lives since 1980.
   Peruvian congressmen from various political parties discarded
the chances of a military coup against the centrist government of
President Alan Garcia.
   Political leaders in Ecuador also dimissed the possibility of a
coup against conservative President Leon Febres Cordero.
   Both countries had military governments during the 1970s.
Democracy was restored in Ecuador in 1979 and in Peru in 1980.

   North Korea on Friday accused South Korean soldiers
of firing across the demilitarized zone separating the two enemies
and destroying equipment. South Korea denied the report.
   A report by the North's official Korean Central News Agency,
monitored in Tokyo, said the soldiers fired on a North Korean post
in Changpung, an area northeast of Kaesong City, on Thursday
evening.
   ``The reckless bombardment seriously threatened the safety of
civil policemen of our side on routine duty and destroyed
facilities of the (guard) post,'' the report said. ``It was
entirely due to the patience of our side that the incident did not
expand into an armed conflict between the two sides.''
   South Korean defense officials said they were investigating.
   The North also accused Seoul of setting a fire Sunday that
burned nearly 3,000 acres on Pyongyang's side of the DMZ.
   In Seoul, the U.S.-led United Nations Command rejected the North
Korean charges.
   ``It's a total fabrication,'' said UNC spokesman Billy
Fullerton, adding that checks in the area found no shooting
incidents at that time.
   Shooting is occasionally reported along the DMZ, a strip of
territory dividing communist North from capitalist South. The two
Koreas never signed a formal peace treaty after an armistice ended
the Korean war in 1953.

Surgery</HEAD>

   Actor James Garner was conscious and in good
spirits Friday after quintuple bypass heart surgery.
   Garner, who won an Emmy Award for ``The Rockford Files,'' was
listed in satisfactory condition and was allowed visits from family
and friends one day after he underwent five hours of surgery, said
Paula Correia, spokeswoman at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center here.
   The 60-year-old actor is expected to remain in intensive care
through Saturday and probably will be hospitalized for another week
to 10 days, she said.
   Garner, who People magazine once dubbed ``the last real man'' in
America, entered the medical center on Monday for tests.
   Doctors had planned to perform surgery for an aneurysm, or
ballooning, of his aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the
heart. But they decided on the bypass surgery after a series of
tests this week.
   Surgery for the aneurysm will be scheduled later, hospital
officials said.
   Garner, a spokesman in the $30 million ``Beef, Real Food for
Real People'' advertising campaign for the beef industry, blamed
his heart problem on cigarettes.
   ``I went to visit him yesterday. He said he regretted having
smoked for 45 years,'' said Ron Wise, Cedars-Sinai spokesman.

   A ballot proposal to create Northern
California's largest gambling hall in the small river town of Rio
Vista was defeated Friday in a recount of last week's close vote.
   The measure, which appeared to have won approval by a two-vote
margin, was defeated after a recount by Solano County election
officials showed a tie, 755 votes in favor and 755 against. A tie
means the measure is rejected.
   The proposal would have established an extensive cardroom that
supporters said would bring millions of dollars annually into the
strapped coffers of the community southwest of Sacramento.
   The action marks the second time the controversial proposal has
gone before local voters. Last November, the measure was defeated
by 30 votes.
   Opponents were led by local church officials, while proponents
included business interests who said the measure would stimulate
the area's economy.

   The government disclosed Friday that
there are 158 people in jail for refusing to serve in the military
under the law that makes 18 months of service compulsory.
   Some church leaders and dissidents had demanded that communist
authorities say how many conscientious objectors are imprisoned.
   The official MTI news agency quoted government spokesman Reszo
Banyas as saying at a news conference Friday there are currently
158 conscientious objectors in jail.
   Of those, he said 146 are Jehovah's Witnesses, six are Roman
Catholics, one is a member of a Nazarene church, one a Seventh Day
Adventist and three are ``uncomfortable'' about military service.
   MTI quoted Banyas as saying the other prisoner, Zsolt
Keszthelyi, objected to military service on political grounds.
   Last spring, Keszthelyi was sentenced to three years after he
refused military service saying the government that controlled the
armed forces was not democratically elected.
   According to Western analysts, about 40 Catholics and many more
Jehovah's Witnesses have been jailed over the past 12 years for
refusing to serve in the army.
   Banyas was quoted as saying the government ``is looking into
this matter and considering adoption of a new decision on
conscientious objectors.''

<HEAD>Shamir's Office Predicts New Period In Israeli-Soviet Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret report prepared by a team of
specialists from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office said Israel
is facing a new and improved period in its troubled relations with
the Soviet Union.
   Israel television said it obtained details of the report and
quoted it on Friday as predicting ``a qualitative change'' in
Israeli-Soviet ties.
   The study was completed this week and was based on various
materials pertaining to the Soviet Union, open as well as
classified, and on an analysis of the Kremlin's latest contacts
with the Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization,
the television report said without attribution.
   Officials from Shamir's office were not available for comment.
   The Soviet Union and all East European countries except Romania
broke ties with the Jewish State following the 1967 Middle East
war. In 1986 and 1987, Israel reestablished low-level diplomatic
ties with Poland and Hungary.
   Last July, Moscow sent a consular delegation to Jerusalem, the
first Soviet diplomatic group to visit Israel in 20 years. A
similar Israeli group was expected to travel to Moscow this month,
but its visas have been delayed, according to Foreign Ministry
officials.
   The specialists' report said the Soviets may now make serious
concessions to Israel, including the issue of the emigration of
Soviet Jews, Israel television said but it gave not details.
   Soviet leaders recently permitted increased Jewish emigration,
which reached a 15-month high of 984 in March.
   Dozens of Soviet Jews, including some who have been denied exit
visas, have been allowed to visit relatives in Israel in recent
months. Some Israeli immigrants from the Soviet Union were
permitted to visit their families in the Soviet Union.
   The television broadcast quoted the report as saying the Soviet
Union may change its pattern of contacts with Israel while taking
into account Israel's close ties with the United States.
   According to the broadcast account, the report predicted an
intensive period of Soviet peace-making activity in the Middle East
and said it may result in an official visit of Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze to Israel during his upcoming Mideast trip.
   The study reportedly noted that Moscow is undertaking a
consistent course of restoring friendly relations with Israel while
demanding more diplomatic flexibility from the Arab states.
   The Soviet Union has said the Middle East conflicts should be
resolved by an international conference and the Palestine
Liberation Organization should participate in peace talks.
   Israel is not ready to accept the participation of the PLO,
which it views as a terrorist group. It also has said the Soviets
must restore diplomatic ties and increase Jewish emigration before
playing any major role in peace talks.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, opposes the proposal
for an international conference, which would include the Soviet
Union as one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council. Shamir has said Israel could be isolated at such a forum
and forced to make territorial concessions on the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir's political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, has
said an international conference is the only way to prepare for
peace talks with Israel's Arab neighbors.
   Peres, head of the socialist Labor Party, expressed optimism
Friday about possible Soviet involvement. Asked to comment on talks
by U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz over the last two days
in Moscow, Peres said:
   ``We still don't know the results of the meeting. But there is
one issue from which we may learn something: It's Afganistan. It
was a very severe case of regional conflict and the superpowers
agreed on how to stop it positively.''
   But Shultz could not persuade the Soviets to restore diplomatic
ties with Israel or pledge to increase Jewish emigration, a U.S.
official in Moscow said.
   The harsh tone of official Soviet statements also contrasted
with the reportedly optimistic study conducted by Shamir's office.
   On Friday, the Soviets accused Israel of state terrorism in the
killing of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir last week in Tunisia.
   ``It is but another example of Israel's cynical contempt for the
world public opinion,'' Soviet Ambassador Alexander Belonogov told
the U.N. Security Council. He called the killing ``another act of
the policy of state terrorism which has long been practiced by
Israel.''

   Leftist guerrillas assassinated two governing
party mayors, burned a textile factory and bombed government and
political party offices in rural districts, police reported Friday.
   Most of the attacks were blamed on rebels of the Maoist Shining
Path movement. The government places the death toll at more than
10,000 since the Shining Path began its violent campaign to
overthrow the government eight years ago.
   Police and government officials gave these reports of the latest
violence:
   Rebels on Friday shot to death Isidoro Garcia, the mayor of
Socabaya 545 miles southeast of Lima. The day before, gunmen killed
the mayor of the village Macachacra 210 miles southeast of the
capital.
   About 15 rebels seized the Cerro Alegre textile factory near
Canete, 85 miles south of Lima, before dawn Friday. They forced
more than 20 workers and security guards to flee and then tossed
incendiary bombs into the plant. The fire blazed for six hours,
destroying bails of cotton worth thousands of dollars.
   A car bomb exploded Friday outside an Industry Ministry office
in Chiclayo, 465 miles north of Lima, and a dynamite bomb went off
in front of the headquarters of the governing Aprista Party in
Huaraz 190 miles northeast of Lima.
   No injuries were reported in the bombings and the attack on the
textile factory.
   Police blamed the the pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement for the bombing in Chiclayo and said about 100 people were
detained for questioning. No arrests were repored in the other
attacks.

   David Eisenhower, who once left notes in the
White House saying ``I will return,'' said Friday that he or one of
his two daughters could follow his famous grandfather's footsteps
into politics.
   ``We're trying to set the stage where we'll be useful in
politics later on or be in a position to help our children become
involved,'' said the 40-year-old Eisenhower, grandson of Dwight D.
Eisenhower and husband of former President Nixon's daughter, Julie.
   Speaking at a regular Tulsa town meeting, Eisenhower said he
might consider a political future ``down the road'' and suggested
that everybody should run for office at some time.
   Eisenhower said in a news conference before his speech that he
believes Nixon has become an elder statesman for the country
because people have placed the Watergate scandal in perspective.
That scandal, which led to Nixon's resignation in 1974, was
responsible for ``cutting the presidency down to size,'' he said.

<HEAD>China Said to Withdraw Offer to Support Arms Embargo Against Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   China has reversed its position and told the
United States it would not endorse an international arms embargo
against Iran, according to a published report.
   China's Foreign Ministry informed U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord
of its new stand after American and Iranian naval forces clashed in
the Persian Gulf this week, The New York Times reported in its
Saturday editions.
   In Moscow, meanwhile, the Soviets turned down a renewed request
from Secretary of State George P. Shultz for support of an arms
embargo. Since China and the Soviet Union have veto power on the
United Nations Security Council, either could block a U.S. move for
U.N. sanctions against Iran.
   Last month, the White House said Chinese Foreign Minister Wu
Xuequian told President Reagan his country would go along with an
arms embargo against Iran if a majority of Security Council members
supported it.
   Following the recent clashes in the gulf, however, China
informed the U.S. that it did not see an arms embargo as the way to
bring the war to an end, The Times reported, quoting an
unidentified State Department official.
   On Monday, U.S. forces sank or crippled six Iranian vessels that
challenged them after they destroyed two offshore platforms in
retaliation for the mining of the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts
last week.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused President Reagan of
wrongly claiming superpower relations had warmed thanks to U.S.
pressure on the Soviets and suggested Reagan stop sermonizing, the
official Tass news agency reported.
   The agency said Gorbachev told Secretary of State George P.
Shultz Friday that despite recently improved superpower relations,
``sermons are again being delivered to us and we are being
instructed on how we should behave ourselves.
   ``Our foreign policy is being assessed only negatively while the
policy of the U.S. administration is assessed only positively,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   ``Morever, everything that has been achieved in Soviet-American
relations is being ascribed to the policy of strength and `putting
pressure on the Soviets,''' the Soviet leader told Shultz,

   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has convened an

women than previously believed are taking the drug Accutane despite
strict warnings that it is likely to cause birth defects.
   Short of an outright ban, the agency has no way to guarantee the

   Many U.S. Navy officers in the Persian
Gulf eagerly had awaited the top-level policy change that now
allows them to intervene in Iranian attacks on neutral merchant
ships.
   Some expressed outrage in the past nine months over Iran's
gunboat attacks on unarmed shipping and their own inability to do
anything about them.
   ``It's like being a world-class athlete who's always ready for
the event but never gets to participate,'' Cmdr. Paul X. Rinn,
skipper of the U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts, said recently.
   The sweeping policy change may encounter strong objections in

   The stock market's attempt to rally since the
crash last fall has failed to impress decision-makers at one of the
nation's largest money-management firms.
   ``It is a rally in a bear market, and we are toward the end of
it,'' contends Henry Gailliot, senior vice president and economist
at the Pittsburgh-based Federated Research Corp.
   ``Whatever you regard as your `defensive' position in regard to
the stock market, we believe you should now be in it,'' Gailliot
added in an interview.
   That puts him at odds with analysts at some of Wall Street's
most prominent brokerage firms, who argue that the current mood of
fear and pessimism is setting the stage for higher stock prices.
   Gailliot agrees rallies usually exhaust themselves only when
they have attracted a large following of true believers. ``I'd like
to see more enthusiasm at the top,'' he acknowledges.
   Nevertheless, he says, spotting the precise moment when such an
event occurs is a very difficult and chancy assignment. And, he
adds, ``the easy money in the rally has already been made.''
   Gailliot bases his reasoning on an appraisal of the
``character'' of the market's rise from its lows late last year.
   In the aftermath of the October crash, Gailliot asserted that
stock prices were almost certain to rebound. However, he added at
the time, the upswing itself would have to be watched for a while
to see whether it looked like only a passing phenomenon or
something more durable.
   By April 13, he concluded the rally had flunked that test.
   In its early stages, the market's rise produced a strong
plurality of individual stocks rising in price vs. those that
declined. But these ``very positive breadth characteristics'' have
``deteriorated significantly in the last month,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, volume of stock trading has contracted as prices have
risen, he observed. ``That is a classic bear-market
characteristic,'' he said.
   In spite of all the recent signs of strength in the economy,
Gailliot believes a recession is lurking in the not-too-distant
future.
   ``The Federal Reserve is being forced back into its old position
of fighting inflation and defending the dollar,'' he says. ``One
must remember that about one-third of all recessions are not
predictable. We only know after the fact.''
   But while he believes the portents are bad for stocks, Gailliot
takes a far more upbeat view of the outlook for bonds: ``A bull
market in bonds began on Black Monday,'' when 30-year Treasury
bonds were yielding about 10.4 percent.
   From that point, prices rose and yields fell to about 8.3
percent several weeks ago. Since then, they have climbed back up to
9 percent, creating what Gailliot views as ``another opportunity to
buy.''
   Once the recession he expects manifests itself and becomes
widely recognized, he maintains, the yield on long-term Treasury
bonds could get as low as 6 percent.
   The recession will eventually set the stage for a new bull
market that could cap off the 1980s as a true ``decade for
financial assets,'' Gailliot says, but he views the investment
outlook for the 1990s as less certain.
   By then, he says, the nation will have stretched its habit of
deficit spending, of consuming more than it produces, to an
important limit.
   At that point, he says, the world's financial markets will
provide the United States with only enough money to carry its
existing debts, rather than to expand them.
   When that happens, he says, the nation will be forced into
making tough choices about how to deal with its domestic and
international deficits, and the choices it makes will go a long way
toward determining the financial shape of the 1990s.

<HEAD>Vietnam Reconciling with Churches but Vatican Ties Still Strained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The communist government has taken
significant steps toward reconciliation with Vietnam's Roman
Catholic and Protestant minorities, but it remains in serious
dispute with the Vatican.
   The Vietnamese authorities object to Vatican plans to canonize
117 people, including 11 Spaniards and 10 Frenchmen, who died at
the hands of Vietnamese rulers in the 18th and 19th centuries.
   The Vatican holds the victims to be martyrs who died in a period
of repression of Catholicism, but Vietnam maintains they were
agents of French colonialism.
   Hanoi says it does not oppose the canonization as such, but
objects to the way it says Vietnamese abroad have seized on it to
make it an anti-communist political issue.
   ``This canonization is not any more a religious affair,'' Vu
Thai Hoa, an official of the government's Commission on Religious
Affairs, said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   The martyrs were beatified earlier this century as the first
step toward sainthood. Vietnam was a French colony at the time. The
Vatican announced the canonization last June and the elevations are
scheduled to take place this June 19.
   Hoa charged that the Vatican never consulted with Hanoi about
the canonization.
   He said those to be canonized include Frenchmen who invaded the
country disguised as missionaries.
   Hoa added that in the documents promoting the cause of
sainthood, the Vatican should delete charges that Vietnamese
authorities have persecuted the church for 300 years.
   He also said references to Republic of Vietnam _ the name of the
pre-1975 government in South Vietnam _ should be changed to the
Vietnam's current official name, Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
   He also said Vietnam also wants the the date of the ceremony
changed because June 19 was the army holiday of the old South
Vietnamese government, which the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
defeated in 1975.
   Hanoi's main concern, however, appears to be that thousands of
the estimated 1 million overseas Vietnamese will stage protests at
the ceremony to be officiated by Pope John Paul II at St. Peter's
Basilica and call on Catholics in Vietnam to oppose their
government.
   ``They are preparing South Vietnam flags and anti-communist
posters for the occasion,'' Hoa said.
   Vietnamese officials also are concerned that this may be the
first step in an attempt to set up a church in exile.
   (A Vatican source, speaking on condition of anonmyity, said
protests won't be permitted at the ceremony but added that the
documents of sainthood were prepared long ago and can't be changed.
The date was ``pure coincidence,'' the source said, adding that the
ceremony was to have been June 26 but had to be changed because
Pope John Paul II had another commitment.)
   Hoa said about 2,500 Catholic priests and 5 million Catholics
remain in Vietnam, along with about 400 Protestant pastors and
200,000 Protestants.
   Vietnam is a mainly Buddhist country of 63 million people.
   Vietnamese emperors executed some Catholics after the first
missionaries began arriving in the late 16th century. American
missionaries brought Protestantism to Vietnam early this century.
   Hundreds of thousands of Catholics streamed south when the
country was divided in 1954 into the communist North and
non-communist South. Many fled the country after the communists
reunified it in 1975.
   Protestants and Catholics were perceived as having backed not
only the French, but later South Vietnam and its ally, the United
States.
   South Vietnam and the Vatican had official relations.
   The Vietnamese Communist Party leader, Nguyen Van Linh, who came
to power in December 1986, has called for an end to discrimination
against Catholics, saying they have a valuable role to play in
Vietnam's development.
   Since then, dozens of priests, many of them military chaplains
or otherwise associated with the South Vietnam government, were
freed from so-called political re-education camps the communists
established after winning the war.
   Hoa said almost all priests have now been released.
   In February 1987, authorities reopened in Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon, the first Catholic seminary since all of them were
closed by 1982. This past February officials permitted the opening
in Hanoi, the nation's capital, the first Protestant seminary since
the last previous one was closed in 1976. Hoa said two more
Catholic seminaries probably will be opened by year's end.
   Last year, two Vietnamese Catholic prelates were allowed to
attend the Worldwide Synod of Bishops at the Vatican, and the head
of the Protestant church in northern Vietnam was permitted to go to
Western Europe for a church congress. Priests also have been freer
to travel inside Vietnam and to talk with foreigners.
   There are signs, too, that churches will be allowed to resume
social welfare work, such as in schools and orphanages, a move
likely to bring more aid from Christian relief agencies in the
West. In November, government officials met with Catholic relief
agency officials from 13 Western countries.
   Suspicions remain, however, that the government is actually
trying to co-opt church leaders rather than allow more freedom.
   The archbishop of Hue, the Rev. Nguyen Kim Dien, remains under
house arrest for opposing a state-supervised organization for
priests.
   The Rev. Tran Dinh Thu, who is 81 years old, has been sentenced
to life in prison after his conviction of printing propaganda and
training dissidents in his Ho Chi Minh City church.

<HEAD>Gephardt and Prestowitz Say Trade Bill Not Tough Enough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trade bill that emerged from the House this
past week was too strong for President Reagan, but it was too weak
for Richard Gephardt and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.
   The Washington insiders say the United States must go even
farther to force other nations to open their markets to U.S.
products and protect vital U.S. industries from unfair competition.
   Government needs to have a master plan for managing foreign
trade, say the people who are sometimes described as ``economic
nationalists.''
   According to their theory, Americans are only kidding themselves
by clinging to the idea that other nations will spontaneously drop
their trade barriers out of enlightened self-interest.
   In fact, they say, Japan has made a national policy of
protecting its domestic industries while picking off American
industries one at a time.
   The United States, which reigned supreme at the end of World War
II, foolishly allowed its economic power to deteriorate at the same
time it was spending billions on its military, the argument goes.
   Gephardt ran for president on this platform, and the Missouri
congressman continues to believe that the public agrees with him
despite his early exit from the Democratic race. He says he was
held back in the presidential primaries only by a lack of money to
get his message across.
   Now comes Prestowitz to add meat to the bones of the argument
with a book called, ``Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Take
the Lead'' (Basic Books, 365 pages).
   Prestowitz started the book in 1986 after quitting the Reagan
administration, where he was the Commerce Department's chief
negotiator on trade with Japan.
   Endorsers of the book include such high-technology business
leaders as David Packard, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., and
Robert W. Galvin, chairman of Motorola Inc.
   Prestowitz says people who oppose government involvement in
trade and industry need to recognize that the government is already
intimately involved in both areas, only in an inefficient and
unplanned way.
   ``We do manage trade, but because we kind of back into it and
say that we're not _ winking _ we come up with the worst of all
possible worlds. We protect industries that are practically corpses
without doing anything to rebuild them,'' Prestowitz said in a
recent interview.
   No more than 10 percent of world trade is fully free now, the
U.S. trade representative's office has estimated. Even the Reagan
administration has import limits, ``voluntary'' or otherwise, on
cars, steel, textiles and semiconductors.
   ``Let's be honest,'' Prestowitz said. ``Let's recognize what
we're doing and let's proceed in a way that gives us more
benefits.''
   Prestowitz praises the Reagan administration's semiconductor
accord with Japan, which he said made it clear that the government
would not let the U.S. chip industry go down the drain.
   That public assurance, which is rare in the United States but
common in Japan, gave companies like Motorola the sense of security
they needed to make a huge investment in returning to production of
memory chips.
   Gephardt, in an interview Friday, said Prestowitz ``performed a
great service by writing this book. Thre's no one in the country
who's had more epxierience in trying to get fair trade than Clyde
Prestowitz.''
   Gephardt was the only Democrat in the House who voted against
the trade bill this past Thursday because he thought it was too
weak. (One other Democratic dissenter, New York's Robert J. Mrazek,
thought the bill was too strong.)
   Fear is one reason many leaders in government and industry hold
back from more aggressive trading practices, Gephardt believes:
``Fear that if you disagree with somebody, as we disagree with the
Russians all the time, that we'll be accused of unfairness, of
racism.''
   In fact, the House-passed trade bill was reviled as
``anti-Japanese'' on Friday by Hajime Tamura, Japan's minister of
international trade and industry, according to Kyodo News Service.
In Japan, ``anti-Japanese'' is almost the same as ``racist.''
   The trade bill is the most comprehensive trade legislation since
1974 and garnered 24 more votes than the two-thirds necessary to
override a Reagan veto. A vote in the Senate is expected Tuesday.
   The most attention-getting portion of the bill was one that had
almost nothing to do with trade: a provision requiring 60 days'
notice of a plant-closing or long-term layoff by companies
employing more than 100 people.
   More significant was a provision requiring investigation of
countries with ``pervasive'' unfair trade practices. The government
could retaliate if the barriers were not eliminated.
   Similarly, industries seriously injured by imports could get
protection if they were willing to make a ``positive adjustment''
to foreign competition.
   Free traders say the United States is largely to blame for its
failure to penetrate foreign markets.

   How many Americans are working in Japan, and how many of those
speak fluent Japanese? asks George McIsaac, a professor at the
University of Rochester.
   At the other end of the spectrum, John Culbertson of the
University of Wisconsin says the United States should wipe out its
trade deficit with a single stroke by negotiating levels of imports
and exports with other countries on a government level.
   Freely importing cheap goods from low-wage nations ``is just
killing your future in the most outrageous way,'' Culbertson said
Friday.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The inflation rate took its biggest jump in 14 months in March,
with clothing, food and gasoline prices leading a 0.5 rise percent
in consumer prices.
   _The federal budget deficit rose to $29.1 billion in March, but
the deficit for the first six months of the fiscal year was 3.5
percent less than in the first half of 1987.
   _Housing starts declined slightly in March because gains in
construction of single-family homes failed to offset a sharp drop
in apartment building.
   _Orders to the nation's factories for ``big ticket'' items
remained strong in March. The Commerce Department said orders for
durable goods rose less than 0.1 percent.
   _General Motors Corp., the first of the big three automakers to
report first-quarter results, said it earned $1.09 billion, up
about 18 percent from $922.5 million the previous year.
   _Airlines offered candy as a reward and the federal government
threatened $1,000 fines as punishment as the law banning smoking on
domestic flights of two hours or more took effect Saturday.
   _Shaken by the cancer death of Chairman James E. Olson, American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. elevated President Robert E. Allen to the
top job and announced a 10.6 percent rise in quarterly profit.
   _Billionaire hotel owners Harry and Leona Helmsley pleaded
innocent to federal tax-fraud charges, the second set of criminal
charges filed in an alleged $4 million scam.
   _Lawyers for Ivan F. Boesky begged for a reduced prison term for
the stock speculator on grounds that his continuing cooperation
with authorities could lead to more indictments on Wall Street.
   _Home Shopping Network Inc. sued Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
alleging that Michael Milken and others in Drexel's junk bond
department schemed to drive down the price of Home Shopping's stock
while handling a bond offering.
   _The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a six-month
experiment to limit program trading on the New York Stock Exchange
on days when the market takes a big swing either up or down.
   _Disclosure that Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca earned
nearly $18 million last year prompted protests from the United Auto
Workers as contract talks opened at the automaker.
   _Tandy Corp. made big news in the personal computing and music
worlds by announcing introduction of a fast new PC and a new kind
of re-recordable compact disk.
   _International Business Machines Corp. took a major step out of
the copier business, signing an agreement that gives Eastman Kodak
Co. all of IBM's existing copier rental agreements and will put a
Kodak logo on IBM copiers.
   _A state judge ordered Irving Bank Corp. to hold a shareholders'
vote May 6 on whether the company should merge with rival Bank of
New York Co. or sell a major stake to Banca Commerciale Italiana of
Italy.
   _J.P. Stevens & Co. said it rejected a $1.22 billion takeover
offer from rival bidders whose joint buyout proposal includes
splitting the textile giant's assets among them.
   _Financier Carl C. Icahn offered to buy the 23 percent of Trans
World Airlines Inc. stock that he does not already own,
resurrecting his proposal to take the company private.

   The story of the stock market's behavior over
the past couple of months has been a whole lot of motion and very
little progress.
   Wide swings stretching over a few days or even a few hours have
been commonplace. Yet a glance back to mid-February shows most of
the popular market indicators barely changed from where they stood
then.
   As they survey this situation, many observers see the market
caught in a classic dilemma.
   Short-term volatility in stock prices in the aftermath of last
year's crash, they agree, has frightened away many individual
investors and money managers at investing institutions.
   But the presence of those same investors may be required if
volatility is going to be reduced.
   In the meantime, many Wall Streeters lament a market climate
that seems given over almost entirely to players with a gimmick _ a
takeover rumor, a matched set of buy and sell orders keyed to an
impending dividend payment, or a computer program ``index
arbitrage'' transaction.
   The outcry over program trading was raised again on Thursday
when the market rose sharply in early trading, took an abrupt drop
at midafternoon and then bounced back again at the close to finish
little changed.
   There seemed to be no fundamental reasons for all these sudden
swings, other than fluctuations in stock index futures that kept
changing the equations on which program trading is based.
   The situation has been described as ``the tail wagging the
dog.'' But William King, head equity trader at Nikko Securities
International, says that description doesn't go far enough.
   ``It has the dog by the tail and is whipping it around in the
air,'' he says.
   Defenders of program trading contend that, by serving an
arbitrage function of keeping prices in line between the futures
and ``cash'' markets, the practice actually serves as a stabilizing
influence over time.
   But King says that argument glosses over ``the dirty little
secret of program trading.''
   ``Derivative-product traders need volatility to prosper. If they
don't have it, they try to manufacture it,'' he said.
   ``They move into positions, and when the conditions are right
they try to `influence' prices.
   ``Instead of providing liquidity, they aggravate the movement in
the direction of the trend.''
   At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
stood at 2,015.09, up 1.16 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose .03 to 147.03;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
.14 to 374.04; and the American Stock Exchange market value index
slipped 1.21 to 298.03.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 155.02 million shares a day,
against 183.57 million the week before.
   The short-term trading mentality prevading the Street these days
also came under attack on April 14, when disappointing news on the
trade deficit touched off a 101.46-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   What sense could it make, many people asked, to chop $100
billion off the value of stocks on the basis of a single statistic
for just one month, which may or may not be reliable and could well
be substantially revised in the next monthly report?
   But longtime observers of the markets say such behavior isn't
really as irrational as it looks.
   After all, they say, professional traders aren't in the business
of contemplative analysis. They are engaged in trying to outwit
each other on a battleground that is constantly shifting.
   ``The latest number is new, additional information, even if it
is often unreliable,'' observed John Connolly at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   ``This information either fits preconceived notions or
challenges them. Arguments may be buttressed and markets moved.''

<HEAD>High Court Ruling Seen as Ratifying Authority Congress Felt It Had</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's ruling this past week that
the federal government may tax interest paid on state and local
government bonds was widely seen as ratifying authority Congress
already felt it had.
   But the decision enraged one group of bond issuers who called it
a ``butchery of the constitution'' and threatened ``drastic
remedies if necessary'' to protect tax exemption from further
erosion.
   Others worried the ruling may encourage a revenue-hungry
Congress to find ways to tax interest on such bonds to fill the
gaping budget deficit.
   The ruling had no effect on the tax-exempt status of the
estimated $730 billion in municipal bonds already outstanding nor
on future issues, which are expected to amount to another $100
billion this year alone.
   Bond fund managers reported no significant selling in tax-exempt
funds occurred after the ruling, and expressed confidence that
Congress would never remove tax exemption retroactively anyway.
   But the ruling could have long-range implications for issuers
who have been selling tax-exempt bonds at relatively low rates of
interest for projects such as schools and roads as well as for
investors who accept lower interest for their money because the
payments have not been taxed by the federal government.
   ``We don't take this as an inconsequential ruling,'' said
Randolph C. Arndt, a spokesman for the National League of Cities.
``It is a very big threat to the capacity of state and local
revenue systems.''
   The case was brought by the state of South Carolina, challenging
a law requiring that state and municipal bonds be registered in the
name of the owner if the interest paid is to be exempt from federal
taxation. It cited the 1895 case Pollock vs. Farmers' Loan & Trust
Co. in which the Supreme Court held that interest earned on a state
bond was exempt from federal taxation.
   This past Wednesday, the Supreme Court rejected the challenge.
In writing the majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan said
that owners of state bonds have no constitutional entitlement
against having to pay federal taxes on the interest earned on the
bonds.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, dissenting from the 7-1 decision,
said the court overruled ``a precedent it has honored for nearly a
hundred years'' and makes state and local government financing
activities partly dependent on ``whether Congress voluntarily
abstains from tapping this permissible source of income tax
revenue.''
   Word of the decision initially sent tax-exempt bond prices
lower, but the market quickly bounced back as traders appeared to
conclude that it made no fundamental changes in how Congress viewed
the issue anyway.
   ``Congress has been legislating for some time under the
presumption that the Pollock decision of 1895 was obsolete,'' said
George Friedlander, managing director for municipal bond research
at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   The chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Congress has presumed for 20
years that it could enact laws involving the federal tax treatment
of state and local government bonds. He said there was no reason to
believe that the court's latest decision ``will either prompt or
deter future congressional action.''
   The Public Securities Association, a trade group for bond
dealers, said it was ``surprised and disappointed that the Supreme
Court went out of its way'' to state its views on tax exemption.
   The group's president, Heather Ruth, said laws enacted in the
past few years have chipped away at the tax-exempt status of some
municipal bonds.
   Fears that Congress would enact restrictions as part of the 1986
tax law prompted issuers to sell a record $220 billion in new
long-term municipal bonds in 1985. New-issue volume has since
fallen to $151 billion in 1986 and $105 billion in 1987 and is
expected to fall to $100 billion this year, she said.
   Alan Beals, the executive director of the National League of
Cities, said local government officials have been ``angered and
disgusted by the unrelenting assault'' by Congress and the
executive branch on local revenue systems and was ``even more
outraged at the willingness of the judicial branch to condone and
even encourage such activities.''
   ``We do not accept this butchery of the constitution and we are
prepared to respond with drastic remedies if necessary,'' he said.
   Arndt said that among the remedies are the possibility of
amending the constitution, enacting legislation to spell out the
exemption or making the issue fundamental to support or opposition
for political candidates.

   Audi of America Inc. said Friday that the
suggested retail prices of 1988 Audi 5000 Series cars will rise by
3 percent on May 9.
   The increases will range from $670 for the least expensive 5000S
sedan, making that model cost $22,850, to $1,060 for the most
expensive 5000CS Turbo Quattro wagon, which will cost $36,310, the
West German automaker's U.S. sales and distribution arm said in a
statement.
   Prices of 1988 Audi 80 and Audi 90 series cars will not be
affected, nor will option prices or transportation charges for any
models, the statement said.

   Oil prices have closed out the week on a mixed
note, as traders took profits and looked ahead to upcoming OPEC
talks aimed at strengthening the market.
   In Friday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts
for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, settled at $18.30 per 42-gallon barrel, down 6 cents from
Thursday.
   Among refined products, contracts for May delivery of wholesale
unleaded gasoline edged 0.16 cent lower to 52.29 cents per gallon,
while wholesale heating oil closed up 0.06 cent at 50.60 cents per
gallon.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst at E.D.&F. Man
International Futures Inc., said technical trading dominated the
day's activity.
   ``The market rallied early on follow-through optimism over the
OPEC meetings next week, but when it failed to get going on the
upside, people just took profits,'' he said.
   Discussions are scheduled to begin Tuesday between
representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and officials of producing countries that are not members
of the 13-nation cartel.
   Later, the cartel will hold a full ministerial meeting.
   In both cases, OPEC will be seeking ways of coordinating
production cutbacks in order to reduce world supplies and boost
prices.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Remain Strong</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite lower-than-expected orders to U.S. factories in March,
analysts say the economy remains strong.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that orders for durable
goods, items expected to last at least three years, were virtually
unchanged last month, reflecting a drop in military hardware that
offset gains in other areas.
   That was far less than the 1.3 percent advance most economists
were expecting. However, the government raised its estimate of new
orders in February. The revised report shows a 0.1 percent gain for
the month, rather than the previously reported 1.1 percent drop.
   The net result was a relatively strong level of orders through
the first quarter of this year, 7.9 percent above a year ago when
compared March to March.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, said the report indicated ``modest growth in the
economy, not a boom but no signs of a big dip.''
   Roger Brinner, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, said it was premature to worry
about sluggish growth in new orders because shipments remain strong
and the backlog in unfilled orders remains high.
   But the lower-than-expected results for March, along with a
stronger dollar overseas, helped both the bond and stock markets,
which have been depressed over fears of inflation and higher
interest rates.
   The key 30-year Treasury bond's price rose about $5 per $1,000
in face amount Friday and its yield fell back under 9 percent. On
Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.69 points to
2,015.09.

<HEAD>Airline Smoking Ban Takes Effect</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new federal ban on smoking on domestic airline
flights lasting under two hours went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT
today.
   The new regulations, which outlaw smoking on flights of less
than two hours, carry stiff fines for violations: up to $1,000 for
smoking and $2,000 for tinkering with lavatory smoke alarms.
   They apply to around 80 percent of all U.S. flights, or an
estimated 13,600 a day.
   Under the new rules, airlines are required to announce to
passengers onboard before takeoff that smoking is prohibited on the
flight, and to keep the ``No Smoking'' indicator lights illuminated
for the duration of affected flights.
   Even if a flight is delayed in the air or on the ground and goes
beyond two hours, smoking will be prohibited if the schedule has it
as lasting two hours or less, according to officials of the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   In addition to the onboard warning, many airlines are making
announcements in the gate area before passengers board the plane.
   Travelers flying United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier,
are being advised individually of the new regulations when they
check in.
   Second-ranked American Airline's flight attendants and ticket
agents have been given special instructions to inform passengers
about which flights will be non-smoking, and boarding passes have
been changed.
   Northwest Airlines, whose tough policy goes beyond the federal
requirements by banning smoking on nearly all its domestic flights,
is handing out candies and mints as well as brochures to
passengers. American is providing cinnamon hard candies suggested
by the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association
as a substitute for cigarettes.
   And Continental Airlines is distributing more than 430,000
pieces of a gum called ``Ban Smoke,'' designed to temporarily
control the urge.
   Airlines say they have briefed their cabin crews on the new
regulations and how to handle potentially defiant smokers. Flight
attendants will tell the rebels that they are in violation of
federal law and advise them of the consequences.
   If a passenger persists in smoking, airlines say they may notify
authorities at the plane's next destination, arrange for the plane
to be met by the police or even divert the aircraft in some cases
involving unruly smokers.
