veterans have been changed, officials said.
   The new number is 1-800-225-4712, officials said Friday.
   The previous phone numbers, one for New York state and one for
the rest of the country, were disconnected in order to consolidate
them into one number at the Aetna Life Insurance Co., which will be

   The $240 million settlement fund resulted from a suit against

<TEXT>
   Preliminary figures from Mexico's
presidential election show the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party candidate winning, but with the lowest margin in its six
decades in office.
   Federal Electoral Commission figures obtained from a reliable
source show Carlos Salinas de Gortari with 47.4 percent of the 4.5
million votes counted so far. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist
National Democratic Front was second with 26.7 percent and Manuel
J. Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party third with
20.7 percent.
   The 4.5 million votes counted are out of 11.7 million ballots
reported so far to the commission. Mexico has 38 million registered
voters but no figures are available how many voted in Wednesday's
election.
   In addition to the presidency, 64 Senate seats and 500 in the
newly expanded Chamber of Deputies are at stake.
   A final vote count is not expected until Sunday. The early leak
appeared designed to counter growing speculation that the ruling
party, known as the PRI for its initials in Spanish, had suffered a
devastating loss.
   Jorge de la Vega Dominguez, chairman of the PRI, proclaimed a
party victory in at least 27 of Mexico's 31 states and said
opposition accusations of fraud were meant to confuse the
electorate.
   ``The PRI is going to defend its legal and unobjectionable
electoral triumph with all the means of the law. It is going to
mobilize the force of all its organizations to combat the
provocation and irresponsibility'' of the opposition, he said.
   A relaxed and smiling Salinas, meeting Friday night with foreign
reporters, insisted that he was more concerned that the vote count
be credible than with his margin of victory.
   ``Those results reflect real votes,'' he said. ``The results so
far ratify this circumstance of plurality ... and a new political
reality in Mexico.''
   He said opposition parties will be most visible in the Chamber
of Deputies, where presumably would have a role in approving or
blocking constitutional changes that require a two-thirds majority.
   At a news conference earlier Friday, Clouthier accused the
government of delaying an announcement in order to falsify results.
``They are waiting to see how to disguise the figures,'' he said.
   ``I believe we won, but I don't want to boast prematurely as my
adversary has,'' he said of the victory claim by Salinas de
Gortari. ``Mexico has changed. Totally changed. ... We will never
have only one party again.''
   Clouthier said he and Cardenas met earlier in the day and agreed
to share their information on voting results in order to challenge
government figures.
   He said they also agreed not to release figures publicly for the
time being, because when the government finds out what information
the opposition has, then officials will know which results they can
``dress up.''
   No PRI presidential candidate since the party's founding in 1929
has won less than 70 percent of the vote.
   The slow count also is making evident splits within the PRI
between the 40-year-old Salinas de Gortari and the old-style
politicians.
   The Federal Electoral Commission, which controls the vote count,
is headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett, who was among
Salinas de Gortari's chief rivals for the presidential nomination.
   Salinas de Gortari has insisted throughout the campaign that he
will introduce a new era in which opposition voices will be heard.
   Cardenas, a former PRI governor in the central state of
Michoacan until his break with the PRI last year, waged an
unusually strong campaign that capitalized on widespread discontent
with the hardships caused by six years of economic crisis.
   The leftist candidate is the son of the revered late President
Lazaro Cardenas. In renouncing his own presidential hopes and
endorsing Cardenas last spring, Heberto Castillo of the rival
Mexican Socialist Party described the Cardenas movement as a
``phenomenon.''
   Salinas de Gortari appeared ready to concede losses to Cardenas
in Michoacan, the central state of Morelos and in the Federal
District, the core of the sprawling Mexico City metropolitan area.
   A fourth Cardenas victory could come in the populous state of
Mexico, which abuts the Federal District on three sides.
   The vote count made available to The Associated Press also
showed Gumersino Magana Negrete of the conservative Mexican
Democratic Party with 0.95 percent of the vote and Rosario Ibarra
de Piedra of the radical Revolutionary Workers Party with 0.4
percent.
   Most districts recorded so far are urban, where Cardenas and
Clouthier are strongest. The Salinas de Gortari percentage could be
expected to rise slightly with reports from rural district where
the PRI is traditionally strong.
   Bartlett said soon after the election that technical
difficulties with a new computer system delayed the returns. He
later blamed bad weather.
   The government says the elections were peaceful and clean. PRI
officials have said charges by opposition parties that the
balloting was fraudulent were a publicity move.
   The Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a civic watchdog group,
recorded 1,100 cases of voting irregularities ranging from
ballot-stuffing to tampering with voter registration rolls.

   Smokers will not be punished for violating
Norway's tough new anti-smoking law, a government official said.
   But operators of restaurants, hotels or other public areas risk
fines if people are found smoking where they shouldn't, Trine Lind,
information secretary of the Social Ministry said Friday.
   The law went into effect July 1, but its provisions were only
set at a cabinet meeting on Friday. Maximum fines were not
immediately published.
   The law bans smoking outside special smoking sections in public
transportion, theater lobbies, banks, post offices and work places.
   The government has said it wants to make Norway tobacco-free by
the year 2000. Four out of 10 adult Norwegians now smoke.

   Mayor Edward Koch told the Pittsburgh Pirates
they'll walk the plank in their next series with the New York Mets,
in another inning _ er, round _ of good-natured goading between
Pittsburgh and New York.
   When the Pirates ran a series of ads two weeks ago calling the
Mets another good reason to hate New York, Koch said of Pittsburgh,
``Where is it?''
   Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff sent Koch a map and reminded him
of Pittsburgh's considerable charms. And Koch, through a television
reporter, invited her to lunch in the Big Apple.
   Koch sent a letter Wednesday to Masloff saying he was
``delighted to learn that Pittsburgh has been designated one of
America's `most-livable cities.''' But the designation obviously
was made, Koch said, by someone ``with a sense of humor.''
   ``I can't promise your Buccaneers (the Pirates) will be walking
on a red carpet when they arrive in the Big Apple for their next
series with the Mets, but we will be looking for an appropriate
plank,'' Koch said.
   The Pirates will be at Shea Stadium for a four-game series
starting July 29. The Mets visit Three Rivers Stadium Aug. 5 for a
four-game meeting.
   Koch's office released his letter Friday, as well as a letter
sent June 30 by Masloff to Koch.
   Masloff wrote, ``While I felt your comment on Pittsburgh's
location was tongue in cheek _ Pittsburgh having been designated
America's most-livable city and being the third-largest corporate
headquarters in the nation _ just to be on the safe side, I am
sending you a map of Pittsburgh.
   ``It would be nice if you could make use of it when the Mets and
Pirates tangle here again,'' she added.

<HEAD>Aegis System Got Poor Marks In GAO Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Aegis air defense system, used by the
cruiser Vincennes last week to track and shoot down an Iranian
passenger jet, may not have been adequately tested before it was
deployed, according to a classified review by a congressional
watchdog agency.
   The General Accounting Office study concluded that the $1
billion system has not proven its ability to discriminate among
targets, said congressional sources who have seen the document.
They spoke Friday on condition they not be named.
   The GAO review started last year and did not mention last week's
destruction of Iran Air flight 655 that killed all 290 people
aboard. The Vincennes fired at the airliner after mistaking it for
an Iranian F-14.
   Pentagon officials have said the Aegis system was not
malfunctioning. A ``minor degradation'' of the Aegis radar was
repaired before the ship entered the Persian Gulf last month, they
said.
   Aegis, named for the shield of Zeus in Greek mythology, is a
complex mix of radars and computers. It was developed as the main
component of protection for Navy surface ships against enemy ships
and planes.
   The Navy is building a fleet of Aegis cruisers, of which the
Vincennes is the third. The service is also using some components
of the Aegis system aboard other surface ships. The system was
first deployed in 1983.
   The GAO review looked at the Aegis testing program before the
system went into service, said the sources.
   The study criticized a series of 1984 tests in which the Aegis
system tracked 11 targets and guided the firing of weapons which
hit 10, the sources said. At one point, two targets were fired upon
at the same time.
   The 1984 test program was set up specifically to answer
complaints from Aegis critics who argued that the system needed
more realistic tests. But the tests were set up so carefully they
did not approximate a ``real-life'' combat environment, the sources
quoted the GAO report as saying.
   In other developments Friday:
   _President Reagan said the issue of whether to pay compensation
for the families of those killed is ``under consideration.'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there were ``still some open
questions'' on the issue.
   _Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the United States should adopt a new stance in the
Iran-Iraq war ``equidistant'' from the two warring countries. ``I
do believe that we'd be much better served in trying to end the war
if we were really in a position of condemning both attacks by Iran
and by Iraq and also condemning the chemical warfare being
conducted against innocent people by Iraq,'' he said.
   _Pentagon officials said they are awaiting results of an
investigation to learn why the Vincennes missed air traffic
communications and other clues indicating that the jet was a
civilian plane and not an F-14 fighter, as officers aboard the ship
believed.
   Iranian officials have said U.S. systems should have been able
to monitor 21 minutes of conversation in English between the
jetliner and the airport control tower in Bandar Abbas.
   But Pentagon spokesmen said they were not sure U.S. forces were
monitoring, or were able to monitor, air traffic control
communications at the time of the incident.
   ``We are looking forward to an analysis of the tapes to help
clarify the issue,' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Baumann, a Pentagon
spokesman.

<HEAD>Order Could Hinder Prosecution On Main Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge's order giving Oliver L. North broader
access to secret government documents for his defense strongly
raises the possibility he won't be tried on the main charges of the
Iran-Contra indictment.
   But the order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell clears the way for the fired White House aide to go to trial
at least on charges he lied to cover up his activities and
personally gained from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The judge's order scheduling the trial for Sept. 20 set the
stage for the proceeding to take place in the middle of the fall
presidential campaign.
   In addition to fixing the trial date, Gesell ruled that North is
entitled to use highly classified documents that might show the
covert activities that are the basis of the Iran-Contra conspiracy
charge were authorized by the Reagan administration.
   The judge noted that some highly sensitive portions of documents
in the prosecution's case that government security experts want
deleted ``tended to exonerate North of guilt on certain charges.''
   Gesell ruled North was entitled to cite these passages in a
public trial. If the government continues to object, those charges
could be dismissed under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
known as CIPA.
   The judge further ordered that independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh and the government must provide North with such highly secret
documents as references in President Reagan's daily intelligence
briefings to covert aid to the Contras.
   The fired National Security Council aide is charged along with
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter and arms
dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.
Secord with conspiring to defraud the government by illegally
diverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   All four defendants, ordered by Gesell to be tried separately,
are also charged with theft of government property and wire fraud.
   Walsh contends that the defendants corrupted the legitimate,
fully authorized presidential initiative of trading U.S. arms for
American hostages by funneling weapons-sale proceeds to the Contras.
   According to court pleadings by Walsh, some of the documents
sought are so sensitive that only the president and a handful of
top officials have access to them.
   Gesell said he was not endorsing North's defense or even the
admissibility of the documents as evidence. But he said the
material should be made available to the retired Marine lieutenant
colonel ``to assure that the truth, whatever it ultimately proves
to be, `will out.'''
   The judge gave North until Aug. 1 to notify the government of
his intention to use classified portions of the documents he
already has as evidence. He set an Aug. 15 deadline for North to
file a similar list of material turned over as a result of Friday's
order.
   ``A jury trial on those counts remaining after the CIPA process
takes it course is set for Sept. 20,'' Gesell said.
   ``It presently appears that, at a minimum, substantive charges
of cover-up, falsification and North's alleged receipt of personal
benefit derived from his conduct as a government employee can
proceed to trial,'' Gesell said.
   In a brief statement, Walsh said: ``We are ready to proceed as
directed by the court.''
   Even if the three major counts are dismissed, North is charged
with 12 other felony counts, including allegations that he:
   _ lied to Congress in 1985 about covert administration aid to
the Contras
   _ shredded documents during Attorney General Edwin Meese III's
November 1986 investigation of the Iran-Contra affair
   _ created phony documents to obstruct an FBI investigation into
the construction of a $15,000 security fence around his home.
   _ accepted the fence as an illegal gratuity from Secord.
   _ pocketed $4,300 worth of traveler's checks from $90,000 given
to him by a Contra leader to defray expenses for helping the rebel
cause.

<HEAD>House Probe Charges Improper Use Of Legal Services Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Legal Services Corp. is defending its
chairman against congressional allegations that he improperly used
government funds for presidential politics, personal business and
to help destroy the agency.
   The corporation, in a prepared statement issued late Friday,
said it has uncovered no evidence ``that would lend credence to
insinuations of misappropriation'' by W. Clark Durant III.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., outlined the allegations and
called for the resignation of Durant, who has served as chairman of
the agency's board since December 1984 and was an adviser to Rep.
Jack Kemp's failed presidential campaign.
   ``He's been undermining the Legal Services Corporation by
personal and political activities ... at the expense of the
taxpayers,'' Morrison charged.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on courts, civil liberties and the
administration of justice, agreed that the evidence appears to show
``significant improprieties in the financial management of the
corporation.''
   ``It's very unlikely that (Durant) could explain these matters
satisfactorily,'' he said.
   Durant, reached by telephone at his Detroit law office, denied
the allegations and countered that the congressional attack was
motivated by political and policy disagreements over the direction
of the agency, which funds legal assistance programs for the poor.
   The corporation said that it discovered during its examination
of the records that ``Mr. Durant is entitled to approximately
$8,800 in attendance fees, which he has not claimed.'' The agency
said it was continuing to review records at the subcommittee's
request.
   The agency said the congressional investigation ``is being used
by some in an attempt to derail needed reforms in the delivery of
government-funded legal services to the poor and to discredit the
efforts of Chairman Durant.''
   Morrison said a preliminary congressional investigation of
corporation records covering an 18-month period revealed that
Durant used Legal Services telephone credit cards to call Kemp
headquarters nine times and may have charged campaign-tied trips to
the agency. Morrison said there were 23 trips to Washington charged
to the agency that have no documentation tying them to Legal
Services work.
   Durant also charged to the agency long-distance phone calls to
high-ranking federal transportation officials, an apparent link to
his private sector post as a railroad trustee, Morrison alleged.
   And the congressman said Durant is ``the man behind'' the
agency's controversial move to hire lobbyists who were instructed
to urge lawmakers to cut the Legal Services budget. The General
Accounting Office said last month that federal law prohibits such
lobbying.
   Morrison added that documents provided by Durant at the
subcommittee's request showed dozens of calls to private,
conservative organizations that have advocated the abolition of
Legal Services, including the Heritage Foundation. Dismantling
Legal Services was an early goal of President Reagan, who appointed
Durant, and the chairman has been a leading critic of his own
agency.
   Morrison, who headed a Legal Services program in New Haven,
Conn., before his election to Congress in 1982, estimated the cost
of ``questionable'' telephone calls at more than $5,000 plus
thousands more in air travel.
   Durant scoffed at the allegations. ``This is purely rooted in
policy and political differences,'' he said.
   ``I don't have anything to hide ...,'' he said. ``If there are
any calls that are not strictly related to Legal Services, I have
no objection and think the corporation should be reimbursed.''
   But he said those would not come close to the dollar estimates
provided by Morrison.
   Durant said he knew of $2.35 in telephone calls that were
mistakenly charged to the agency, and he said he knew of no travel
expenses.
   The decision to hire the lobbyists was made by John H. Bayly
Jr., then president of Legal Services, Durant said. But the
congressmen said Durant was behind the move to hire the lobbyists
and then orchestrated a move to force Bayly out of his job.

to perform some sacramental acts for members who object to having a
female bishop.
   Approval of the measure was in doubt briefly Friday after a
minor amendment was tacked onto it by the House of Delegates, one
of two bodies meeting at the church's 69th General Convention here
through Monday. But the House of Bishops, the church's other
legislative body, concurred later Friday.
   While some at the meeting saw the resolution as watering down a
1976 decision approving the ordination of women, it sets a six-year
time limit on the authority to name a ``visitor,'' as the man would
be called.
   The resolution was approved 122-94 in the House of Delegates and
140-28 in the House of Bishops.
   There are no women yet serving as bishops in the Episcopal
Church, but about 900 female priests have been ordained.
   ``I'm sorry that the statement was accepted. I'm glad there is a
time limit, I can live with it,'' said the Rev. Terry Meadows, a
female priest from southern Ohio.
   Patricia House, a lay member of the House of Deputies from San
Diego said the time limit ``undermines the Episcopate in the long
run. I feel that a woman bishop would hasten the day of
understanding.''
   The Rev. Robert Carey of the east Oregon diocese backed the
proposal and its limit.
   ``I think the death of a belief is as painful as the death of a
relationship,'' he said. ``There is a belief system dying. We need
to be concerned during grieving process and reach out as often as
we can.''
   Also on Friday:
   _The House of Bishops approved a resolution in response to a
call by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu to boycott American
companies doing business in South Africa. The resolution goes to
the House of Delegates.
   _The House of Bishops unanimously approved an economic
development package that passed the House of Deputies on Wednesday
and calls for $250,000 from the church over the next three years to
create community land trust, cooperative housing, employee-owned
businesses, and community credit unions.

   Dudley Moore says his sensitivity to alcohol
abuse tempered his portrayal of the lovable lush ``Arthur'' in the
sequel ``Arthur 2 On The Rocks.''
   Moore, who won an Oscar nomination for his performance as the
drunken millionaire Arthur Bach, said his approach to the character
this time was different because of a heightened awareness of
alcoholism.
   ``There was no official pressure from the studio or from any
organized groups,'' Moore said recently. ``But I personally have an
educated awareness of the problem.''
   The producers also avoided any scenes in ``Arthur 2 On The
Rocks'' of Arthur drinking and driving, unlike the original, in
which Arthur is seen cruising in his Rolls Royce swigging from a
bottle.
   ``There's a scene in which Linda (Liza Minnelli) says she never
lets him drink and drive,'' Moore said. ``And you can tell that
Arthur knows exactly what he should or should not do. He still gets
very drunk, but that's because he feels panicked and isolated
sometimes and unable to cope with the world.''
   But Moore is quick to point out that the film doesn't preach.
   The sequel opened Friday at theaters nationwide.

   The Duchess of York, who is eight months pregnant,
escaped injury when her chauffeured car collided with an oncoming
vehicle, police and Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident occurred Friday on a section of the M40, a busy
highway about 20 miles outside of London. Part of the road was
closed for repairs, police said.
   A police bodyguard was driving the duchess' Jaguar. She
continued the journey in an accompanying police car, Buckingham
Palace said.
   The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, is married
to Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II. She is

   The Ramones, the band that gave the world
``Cretin Hop,'' ``Teen-age Lobotomy'' and other short, loud, fast
and somewhat silly punk tunes, is celebrating its 15th anniversary.
   The Ramones _ Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee, and Marky Ramone, who are
not related but took the surname for the stage _ marked the
milestone recently by releasing ``Ramonesmania,'' a two-record
anthology of their best-known material.
   Except for an occasional guitar solo by Johnny Ramone _ a lapse
some fans equate with selling out _ the anthology shows the punk
pioneers have stuck to the formula of two-minute, three-cord
head-bangers.
   ``We're a band that our fans can count on,'' Joey Ramone said
recently.

   A Tallahassee police officer was killed
and three heavily armed Maryland prison escapees were wounded in a
gun battle that erupted Friday when the officer stopped to check a
suspicious vehicle, a spokesman said.
   The slain officer was Ernest Ponce De Leon, 40, said police
spokesman Phil Kiracofe. A former reserve officer and probation
official, Ponce De Leon became a full-time member of the department
in December 1986.
   He died Friday morning from two gunshots to the chest, said
Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center spokesman Ron Brafford.
   Four injured people, all occupants of the car Ponce De Leon had
investigated, were arrested after the shooting behind a laundry
several miles southwest of downtown.
   Police said Clarence J. Jones, 33, had gone to the trunk to
retrieve identification but instead pulled a pistol from the
vehicle and opened fire.
   The three escapees were wounded by gunfire returned by backup
Officer Greg Armstrong, a member of the department for less than a
year. A fourth occupant of the car, a Jacksonville woman, also was
wounded, apparently by gunfire from one of the other suspects, said
Kiracofe.
   Armstrong ``did very well. He emptied his weapon at least once
and had to reload under an awful lot of pressure. He fired a lot of
rounds'' with a .357-caliber Magnum service revolver, said Kiracofe.
   The escapees were identified late Friday as Jones, who was
serving 25 years for robbery with a deadly weapon and attempted
robbery; Henry Goins, 26, who was serving 12 years for rape,
kidnapping and robbery with a deadly weapon; and Irvin Griffin, 28,
who was serving 45 years for assault with intent to murder.
   Jones was treated for a gunshot to the face and then released
for police questioning, said Kiracofe.
   Goins was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the
head, said Brafford. Kiracofe said he might survive but would have
brain damage.
   Griffin was listed in stable condition with a gunshot to the
thigh at Tallahassee Memorial.
   Beverly Lee Harris, 39, a longtime acquaintance of Griffin, was
in stable condition at Tallahassee Community Hospital, said Ronald
Rudderman, assistant hospital administrator. She was expected to be
released to police for questioning.
   All four face possible first-degree murder charges and if
convicted under Florida's felony-murder law they could be sentenced
to die in the state's electric chair.
   The location of the fourth Maryland escapee, Douglas Edgerton,
21, who was serving a 20-year sentence for second-degree murder,
was unknown.
   The four escaped June 25 by overpowering a guard in a recreation
yard at Maryland House of Correction. Their escape was the largest
from the 1,600-inmate medium-security institution since 1979 when
30 men got away.

   Sixty-four men survived the Piper
Alpha oil rig fire by leaping into the burning sea in the dark, but
they had to leave behind more than 100 colleagues trapped and
screaming for air in the inferno.
   ``I am one of the lucky ones,'' Harry Calder said in an
interview Friday. ``I am pretty sore, I am badly bruised and my
hands are burned. But at least I'm alive. I have lost a lot of
friends.''
   Seventeen bodies have been found and 166 men are presumed dead
in the North Sea oil field where the rig exploded Wednesday night.
   At least 100 men died screaming for help, trapped in their
sleeping quarters after surviving the first explosion, said Calder,
a 35-year-old helicopter landing officer.
   The workers were in the smoke-filled galley of the platform,
which was plunged into darkness when the emergency lighting failed,
he said in an interview Friday.
   ``Windows and the emergency door were cracking under the intense
heat. There must have been at least 100 men in there,'' Calder
said. ``Men were shouting into their radios: `We need breathing
apparatus. What's happening? Is there anybody getting out? We are
all going to die.'
   ``It was sheer panic. A lot of guys were lying on the floor,
just trying to breathe. We had towels and we were just dipping them
in anything to help us breathe,'' he said.
   Calder and a co-worker got out through a rear door just in time,
he said, ``but I don't think the others made it. I would have
perished with them if I hadn't got out when I did.''
   He said he was asleep when the first explosion ripped through
the rig, but he and his colleague had climbed on to the roof of the
helicopter deck by the time the second blast hit. They made their
way to the pipe deck and lay under a steel table for protection.
   ``We were hardly getting any breath. It was really bad,'' he
said. ``Then, all of a sudden, the floor collapsed and we found
ourselves lying at an angle. We saw a clear view looking through
the smoke. We said rather than burn, we can get through that and
jump.
   ``We crawled along pipes which were scalding hot. I burned my
hands,'' he said. ``We got to the edge of the platform and just
jumped. It was well over 100 feet to the sea. I missed the flames
in the water.
   ``I didn't have a life jacket,'' Calder said. ``I hit the water
and came up and I was OK. I started swimming and kept swimming.''
   The two men got clear and Calder said he held onto his
co-worker's life jacket. ``Then a life jacket appeared on the water
in front of me and I put it on. It was a stroke of luck.
   ``There was debris everywhere and a lot of guys were sitting on
pieces of debris. The waves were coming over my head.
   ``Then I saw a supply boat. It was easily a mile away. I kept
swimming and swimming and waving and shouting. I wasn't sure
whether I had been seen.
   ``I was sure the skipper had given me a flash with his lights,
but the boat seemed to be going away,'' Calder said. ``I thought
that was going to be it _ that I was going to die.
   ``Then the boat went into reverse and turned round. It came to
me and threw me a lifeline. They pulled me aboard. My friend was
picked up by another vessel. I was told later that he was OK.''
   Another survivor, 50-year-old James McDonald, said that when he
and some others tried to leave the crew's quarters, ``the flames
were shooting into the doors. ... For about three-quarters of an
hour we were sitting inside. Nobody seemed to know what to do.''
   Fire spread rapidly, turning metal girders red-hot and bringing
decks crashing down in half-molten heaps.
   The men faced a hard choice: stay aboard and hope aid got to
them before the flames, or jump into a sea that was cold enough
below the burning oil to kill them. Even on a clear summer night,
the water temperature was 57 degrees.
   Burning oil was spreading across the few bare patches of water
remaining and the decision had to be made quickly.
   ``I decided to get myself out,'' McDonald said. ``I wasn't going
to sit down and get burned to death. ... You either stayed where
you were and burned to death or you tried to get out.''

   President and military leader Augusto
Pinochet said a plebiscite to choose the president for 1989-97 will
take place within the next 90 days. He is expected to be the only
candidate.
   Pinochet also said Friday he already has a platform for his next
presidential term, but he refused to disclose it because the
opposition ``would copy it.''
   ``The plebiscite is near. There are less than 90 days left,''
Pinochet told an audience of 16,000 supporters in this southern
port city 330 miles from Santiago.
   The 72-year-old army commander has ruled this South American
nation since a 1973 coup. His remark was the most precise
indication so far of a date for the ballot.
   According to the 1980 military-drafted Constitution, the
nation's next presiddnt will be picked in a plebiscite in which
Chileans will only be able to vote yes or no on a single candidate
nominated by the heads of the three armed services and the national
police.
   Pinochet himself will participate in the nomination as
commander-in-chief of the army and is considered the most likely
nominee. He is allowed by the Constitution to seek re-election and
has clearly indicated he intends to do so.
   If voters approve the nominee, he will serve for eight years
starting in March 1989. If rejected, Pinochet will remain in power
until 1990, and an open election would take place.
   Pinochet blasted opposition leaders seeking support from the
international community as ``traitors.''
   He said some critics who recently were given limited access to
television are going too far in their broadscast remarks.
   ``When those bad Chileans make insults on television, because
they know we are in a democracy and we won't do anything to them,
let's tell them that our patience has limits and that they could
soon discover those limits,'' Pinochet warned.
   He predicted an overwhelming victory in the upcoming plebiscite
and said of his opponents, ``We will wipe them out.''

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, saying the timing his appearance at a GOP
fundraiser in Atlanta isn't aimed at the Democrats: ``We are not
going to rain on their parade. That is not to say we're not praying
for rain.''
   
   PAUL KIRK, Democratic party chairman, suggesting Bush may have
violated the law by using tax money for campaign trips: ``The only
thing that matches the hypocrisy of the Republican Party of the
1980s claiming to be the party of fiscal conservatism is the
Republican Party of the 1980s preaching about law and order.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, appearing in Texarkana with Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, asked whether Bentsen might be more valuable remaining in
the Senate than joining him on the Democratic ticket: ``I'm
pondering. He could make a great contribution in this county in
many, many ways. He already has.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, on Bush's recent pledge to appoint a Hispanic to
his Cabinet if elected president: ``Bush came through here the
other day talking about his conversion to a new religion _
respecting Hispanics is a new religion of his.''

<HEAD>Senators Urge Reagan to Divert Water from Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES HANNAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Falling water levels on the Mississippi River
that have stranded barges are threatening to trigger a regional
water fight on Capitol Hill, pitting southern senators and others
against Great Lakes lawmakers.
   On Friday, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., asked President Reagan
for an emergency diversion of water from the Great Lakes.
   Sasser and 12 other senators urged Reagan in a letter to direct
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to increase the flow of Great
Lakes water to the Illinois Waterway and the lower Mississippi from
3,000 to 10,000 cubic feet per second for 100 days.
   The action triggered immediate opposition from several Midwest
lawmakers led by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who said it would
be illegal unless approved by all the Great Lakes governors.
   And in Canada, Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn told Parliament
that Canada's ambassador in Washington, Allan Gotlieb, would
deliver a formal notice to the State Department saying that Canada
is unalterably opposed to any diversion.
   Hnatyshyn said Canada can veto any diversion proposal as a
result of several treaties. ``We control our resources,'' he said.
``We will continue to control our resources.''
   Sasser said the drought has pushed water levels on the
Mississippi three feet lower than they have been since 1872, when
officials first began keeping records. As many as 3,000 barges are
stranded, with the loss to the barge and towing industry possibly
exceeding $60 million, he said.
   ``Communities along the river face the prospects of drinking
water shortages and drinking water pollution because of the
drought,'' said Sasser.
   He said the diversion would raise the level of the river by one
foot in St. Louis and six inches in Memphis and only lower the
level of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron by one inch.
   Metzenbaum said the Great Lakes states are hurting as well. He
said Great Lakes water levels have fallen two feet in the past 18
months and are likely to continue to fall.
   Metzenbaum also said any action to divert the water would be
illegal because the 1986 Water Resources Development Act bars
diversion unless it is approved by all of the Great Lakes governors.
   Also, the Supreme Court has set a limit on how much water can be
diverted without its permission.
   Sasser said he believes the president has the authority to take
the action as commander in chief in a national emergency.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said corps officials he has talked to
do not believe they have the legal authority to take the action or
that it would do much good. He said they believe that reducing the
loads of barges would be more effective.
   Lake levels have dropped by 30 inches in the past two years,
said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich.
   Added Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., ``Diversion of water from
the Great Lakes into the Mississippi may damage navigation,
hydroelectric generation and the environment.''
   Signing the letter to Reagan urging the diversion were Sasser
and Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., David Pryor,
D-Ark., Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Paul Simon, D-Ill., John Stennis,
D-Miss., Bennett Johnston, D-La., John Breaux, D-La., Wendell Ford,
D-Ky., Alan Dixon, D-Ill., John Danforth, R-Mo., and Christopher
Bond, R-Mo.
   Others joining Metzenbaum in speaking against the action were
Sens. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., and Bob Kasten, R-Wis.

   Firefighters battling a 5-day-old,
16,500-acre blaze near Mount Rushmore National Memorial finally had
the weather on their side Friday as they worked to reinforce
existing fire lines before digging new ones.
   Brief late-afternoon thundershowers pelted parts of the fire in
the Black Hills National Forest, including the southwestern side
considered the most serious problem area.
   ``This southern portion of the fire got dumped on pretty good,''
said fire information officer Jerry Hagen. ``We don't think the
whole fire got rained on.''
   Rainfall amounts were not known, but firefighters getting ready
to go on the night shift were smiling during a 30-minute
thundershower and hail storm.
   Earlier, Dennis Neill of the U.S. Forest Service said the
showers helped lower the temperature and raise the humidity, but
also could bring stronger winds and the possibility of lightning.
   Lightning is believed to have started the fire Monday night in
Custer State Park. It spread Wednesday into the Black Hills
National Forest, site of the memorial to four presidents. Friday
afternoon, flames jumped a highway and 30 families were ordered to
evacuate.
   The blaze could be contained by Sunday night if the weather
holds, said Richard Homann, a spokesman for the state Division of
Forestry.
   In Alaska, meanwhile, 32 fires burned, four of which had
consumed more than 290,000 acres. Fires also burned on in
drought-parched timber and grassland in Wyoming, Utah and South
Carolina.
   The South Dakota fire threatened Mount Rushmore National
Memorial and the town of Keystone on Wednesday night, but it
stopped short of the tourist stops, both of which had been
evacuated. Mount Rushmore and Keystone were reopened Thursday, but
Custer State Park remained off-limits.
   The fire had burned an estimated 16,500 acres by late Friday.
Seventeen miles of fire line had been built and 64 percent of the
perimeter had been contained, Hagen said.
   The cost to fight the fire so far is $361,000, and it could cost
$1 million when all the expenses are tallied, Homann said.
   In Alaska, a blaze that had come within 10 miles of the Alaska
Pipeline was held in check for a second day. Northern Alaska's
major fires are a 126,000-acre blaze 15 miles north of Livengood; a
40,000-acre fire near Ambler; a 53,000-acre fire northeast of Fort
Yukon; and a 51,000-acre fire north of Central.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Wyoming, three fires in the Bridger-Teton National Forest
totaling nearly 1,500 acres were spreading firefighters thin in the
rough terrain. Although one of the fires was only three acres,
officials warned that it had to potential to rapidly become a major
blaze. The fire near Pinedale, at 1,300 acres by far the largest of
the three, was declared controlled Friday morning.
   Firefighters working on a 1,650-acre fire in Wyoming's Shoshone
National Forest continued mop-up work, and state Forestry Division
crews contained fires covering almost 2,000 acres in Converse,
Sheridan and Weston counties.
   _A wind-whipped fire in Echo Canyon in northern Utah doubled in
size overnight to about 650 acres, but fire bosses were optimistic
it would be contained late Friday, said Interagency Fire Center
spokesman Pete Hansen. Firefighters controlled both the 900-acre
blaze in Zion National Park and a 3,500-acre fire near the Nevada
border.
   _A 1,000-acre timberland fire near Nixonville, S.C., that jumped
plowed fire lines in five places Thursday was declared contained
Friday. Two water bucket-equipped helicopters helped contain the
blaze, which began Wednesday on land owned by International Paper
Co.

<HEAD>Caribbean Leaders Say US Drug Fight Should Not Interfere In Region</HEAD>
<HEAD>By HELEN J. SIMON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of 13 Caribbean nations
have accused the U.S. Justice Department of interfering in their
region's affairs as it cracks down on drugs and urged President
Reagan to halt the meddling.
   Members of Caricom _ the Caribbean Community and Common Market _
ended five days of talks Friday without agreeing on Haiti's coup
but they agreed to work toward eliminating obstacles to regional
trade by Oct. 1.
   The leaders drafted a letter to President Reagan saying that the
U.S. Justice Department was overstepping its jurisdiction by
investigating alleged drug traffickers in Panama and the Caribbean.
   The contents of the letter were not revealed, but Antigua Deputy
Prime Minister Lester Bird said it would be signed by the Caricom
secretary general to represent all the leaders.
   Bird announced it would protest what the leaders considered a
``derogation'' of their local laws and U.S. violations of their
sovereignty as the Reagan administration seeks to win favor in an
election year.
   Some of the leaders criticized Bird for making the announcement
prematurely. Prime Minister James Mitchell of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines said it was ``bad manners.''
   Others stressed their traditionally close ties with the United
States and said it had not intervened directly in their affairs.
   Bird, reading from a communique drafted by the leaders, said
they also ``reaffirmed their total commitment to the fight against
... all illegal trafficking in drugs.''
   ``They expressed their willingness to ccoperate with other
countries for the establishment of internationally acceptable
mechanisms to bring offenders to justice,'' he said.
   The Caribbean has long been a source and an important conduit
for drugs coming into the United States. Cocaine from South America
traditionaly passes through Caribbean ports before entering the
United States. Much marijuana is also grown in the area.
   From the start of the meeting Monday, it was apparent the
leaders were unlikely to reach unanimous agreement, as required by
Caricom rules, on what position to take on the Haitian military
government that ousted President Leslie Manigat in a coup June 19.
   They debated options ranging from revoking Haiti's status as an
observer on four Caricom standing committees to simply issuing a
strong statement denouncing the coup.
   The leaders were more successful when talking about
intra-regional trade.
   The leaders agreed to remove all trade obstacles, such as stamp
duties and import licenses, by Oct. 1 and to study a request by the
smaller countries to protect 23 items they consider too fragile to
compete with imports.
   Trade and industry ministers will meet before the Oct. 1
deadline to decide which items should be excluded and for how long.
   Caricom, established in 1973 to promote regional trade and set
common positions on international events, includes Antigua-Barbuda,
Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica,
Montserrat, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines and Trinidad-Tobago.

   One of two pilots of a West German
army helicopter that crashed in the Alps and killed all nine people
aboard was drunk at the time, the Defense Ministry said.
   Five civilians, the three-man crew and another West German
soldier were killed when the Bell UH-1-D helicopter smashed into a
cliff in the Bavarian Alps on Sunday.
   The ministry said Friday that one of the two dead pilots was
found to have had a blood alcohol content of .25 percent. It did
not say which pilot was operating the aircraft at the time of the
crash.
   In the United States, a blood alcohol content of around .1
percent is considered drunk. A blood alcohol content of .25 is
considered very drunk.

   A cruise ship officer stripped to his shorts and
leapt more than 50-feet into choppy night seas to rescue a drowning
woman, the Coast Guard said Friday.
   The woman either fell or jumped off the Scandinavian Sky cruise
ship 11 miles east of Cape Canaveral Thursday night, said Petty
Officer Tom Leyden.
   Sylvie Mullaly, 31, of Cocoa Beach, and her rescuer, Staff Capt.
Lars Kragelund, were treated and released from Cape Canaveral
Hospital following the ships return, the Coast Guard said.
   Mullaly, who works at a topless nightclub in Cocoa Beach, is
under investigation for possible intoxication, Leyden said. An
investigation of the entire incident, including the ship's safety
procedures, is underway, he said.
   Ms. Mullaly was spotted bobbing in the water as the ship
returned from a daylong cruise, Leyden said. Kragelund raced from
the ship's wheelhouse, peeling off his uniform as he ran and dived
from a ship's rail, he said.
   As he swam to the woman, the ship's crew assumed ``man
overboard'' alert stations and the vessel swung in a wide circle
around the couple, Leyden said.
   ``Apparently they were retrieved from the water via ladder. The
Coast Guard headed to the scene but turned back when we found out
they had her'' out of the water, he said.
   The Scandinavian Sky is owned by Miami-based Sea Escape Limited
and registered in Panama, according to Coast Guard reports.

<HEAD>Investigators Looking Into Whether Paisley Took Bribes In Navy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Court papers have revealed for the first time
that federal agents are looking at whether one of the Navy's former
top officials accepted bribes while he helped direct President
Reagan's defense buildup.
   A search warrant used by the FBI in the June 14 search of
defense consultant Melvyn R. Paisley's home in nearby McLean, Va.,
said agents sought details about ``payment from General Dynamics
and McDonnell Douglas to Paisley in the form of checks, gifts or
other forms of remuneration, or to his wife, Vicki'' at the time he
was an assistant Navy secretary.
   Another entry states agents wanted information about ``payments
or gratuities from Pratt & Whitney employees to Paisley'' before he
left the Navy in March 1987. Pratt & Whitney is a division of
United Technologies Corp.
   As an assistant Navy secretary between 1981 and 1987, Paisley,
63, played a key role in guiding the enhancement of the Navy under
then-Navy Secretary John Lehman Jr. A former executive at the
Boeing Co., Paisley left government to become a consultant.
   Paisley has surfaced as a key figure in the investigation into
allegations that defense contractors and consultants, many of them
former military men, bribed Pentagon officials for contracting
details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of
dollars. To date, no one has been charged in the case.
   The Washington Post reported today that the unnamed informer
referred to in an early government affidavit who helped
investigators launch the probe is a retired Marine Corps major who
is now serving a prison sentence for child molestation.
   The Post, quoting unnamed sources, said consultant John P.
Marlowe offered inside information on Marine contracts to a defense
firm and later agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and secretly tape his conversations with other consultants.
   Marlowe, 45, is serving a six-year sentence at a Virginia state
prison for his 1985 conviction on charges of indecent exposure and
aggravated sexual battery in cases involving two girls aged nine
and 10, the Post reported.
   Paisley's house was one of as many as 40 premises across the
nation searched on June 14, the day the FBI revealed the existence
of the investigation of alleged massive corruption in the $150
billion-a-year Defense Department purchasing system.
   The search warrant, which was released by a magistrate's clerk
in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., said the FBI also sought
evidence that Paisley gave James E. Gaines, a deputy assistant
secretary of the Navy, a Western painting titled ``Lonesome
Whistle.''
   They also sought evidence that Paisley or fellow consultant
William Galvin provided gratuities to Gaines, including ``money to
Gaines' companies, entertainment tickets, and tires.''
   The FBI documents showed the government is investigating
Paisley's work as a consultant to 10 defense contractors and
disclosed the names of several Pentagon employees, or former
Pentagon employees, whose contacts with Paisley are being
investigated.
   The warrant sought any document ``establishing an employee or
contractual relationship'' between Paisley and these 10 companies:
McDonnell Douglas Corp., Martin Marietta, BDM, EMS, Pocal, Ball
Aerospace, United Technologies Corp., Norden, Unisys and Whittaker.
   Agents are looking at Paisley's efforts to obtain government
contracts for them from 1981 through 1988.
   Among the people mentioned specifically in the warrant was a
person identified as Rumpf.
   Richard R. Rumpf, the principal deputy assistant secretary of
the Navy for research, engineering and systems, was Paisley's
deputy in the Pentagon. His wife, Lenore, works for the Navy Air
Systems Command.
   Rumpf did not return a telephone call to his office Friday.
   Also mentioned was Ann Berman, a former deputy assistant
secretary of the Navy who now works for United Technologies. Berman
said she would have no comment.
   Paisley has not commented on the probe, but his attorney, E.
Lawrence Barcella, has criticized leaks of information about the
probe and has dismissed the allegations as ``garbage.''
   Of interest to investigators is Paisley's involvement _ both in
the Pentagon and as a consultant _ in the Advanced Tactical
Aircraft, one of the Navy's biggest procurement programs.
   McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics are partners in the $4
billion program awarded last year to build the new aircraft.
   In another instance, the government searched for evidence that
Paisley supported Pratt & Whitney for the ``JVX project and V-22
engine,'' and ``payments or gratuities from Pratt and Whitney
employees to Paisley during his tenure as assistant secretary of
the Navy.''
   Paisley's involvement with foreign concerns also was targeted in
the search warrant. Investigators sought information about
Paisley's involvement with the Mazlat Co., an Israeli company.
   In 1986, the Navy awarded a $26 million contract to consortium
comprised of Mazlat and the American AAI corporation to build three
remotely piloted vehicles, known as drones.
   The FBI sought several items dealing with McDonnell Douglas, the
St. Louis-based defense contractor. The company supplies American
forces with helicopters and fighter planes, and is involved in
efforts to sell advanced fighter aircraft to several nations.
   An FBI list of items seized by agents at the Paisley's home
included tax returns, bank account numbers, Paisley's security
badge from General Dynamics and a ``confidential 12 pg memo re
visit to China.''
   Pentagon spokesman Fred S. Hoffman said the Defense Department
had no reaction to the revelations. ``We have it in hand and are
studying it,'' he said.
   Al Spivak, a spokesman for General Dynamics, said the company
``knows of no payment of bribes by this company or any of its
people'' to Paisley or his wife while Paisley was in the Navy or in
private life. James Linse, a spokesman for Pratt & Whitney, said he
could not comment because he had not seen the warrant.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimmy Edwards, the mustachioed radio and
television actor who kept Britons laughing in the dark days of food
rationing after World War II, has died, his brother Alan Edwards
said. He was 68.
   The comedian died Thursday of bronchial pneumonia in London's
Cromwell Hospital.
   He had been ill for several weeks after returning from a show
business tour in Australia, his brother said.
   Edwards was famed for his huge 11-inch-long mustache, burly
frame and gravelly voice.
   After the war, Edward's starring role in the British
Broadcasting Corp.'s radio series ``Take It From Here'' ran for 11
years.
   He appeared in several plays in London's West End theaterland
and gave a memorable performance in the 1956 movie version of
Jerome K. Jerome's classic comic novel ``Three Men in a Boat''
about a trip up the River Thames in a rowboat in the 1880s.
   During the war, Edwards flew with the Royal Air Force and won
the Distinguished Flying Cross, one of Britain's highest awards for
flying bravery.
   In 1962, he tried to become a House of Commons legislator for
the Conservative Party but was narrowly defeated.
   In 1959, he married actress Valerie Seymour but they were
divorced 11 years later.

<HEAD>US Cruiser Had Radar Malfunction In June</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Airliner Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. missile cruiser that shot down
an Iranian passenger jet it mistook for a fighter plane was out of
action last month because its radar malfunctioned, U.S. officials
said.
   But a Navy spokesman said the breakdown on the USS Vincennes in
June was only a ``minor degradation'' and had no bearing on
Sunday's disaster that left 290 dead in the Persian Gulf.
   U.S. officials say the billion-dollar warship's high-tech radar
system received signals from the Iran Air Airbus A300 identifying
it as an Iranian F-14 fighter coming in for an attack. Iran said
all 290 people aboard were killed.
   The breakdown was reported on June 13 by The Associated Press,
although gulf-based U.S. Navy officials refused then to confirm
that the problem lay in the computerized system, called Aegis.
   The Aegis system of computer-linked radar and weapons is
designed primarily for defending a naval fleet in the open ocean
from air and missile attack. The Navy says it can detect, identify
and head off a threat developing hundreds of miles away.
   The 9,600-ton Vincennes arrived in the gulf May 27, the first of
the Navy's Aegis cruisers to be assigned to the U.S. naval force in
the waterway.
   It was assigned to patrol in the southern gulf, but by about
June 10 it was anchored off Bahrain, where Navy sources said it was
undergoing repair work on the radar system that lies at the core of
its capabilities.
   A Navy spokesman in the gulf, asked about the reported breakdown
at that time, said only that the ship was in port for ``maintenance
upkeep,'' the result of an unspecified problem.
   Officials here refused comment Friday, but a Navy spokesman at
the Pentagon, Lt. Brian Cullin, confirmed the Vincennes had been
down with a ``minor degradation'' of its radar system. He said
there was no connection between that and the shooting down of the
Iranian jetliner.
   ``The problem had absolutely no bearing on the whole incident,''
he said in a telephone interview. ``It (the cruiser) was never less
than 100 percent up on any mission capability, including
anti-aircraft warfare.''
   He said he could not confirm that the ship was out of action for
16 days, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.
   Cullin said the problem had actually been detected during the
Vincennes' 32-day voyage from San Diego to the Arabian Sea, where
it arrived May 22.
   A necessary replacement part was flown to the ship and installed
by the ship's own crew, he said, ``and the ship was back up on line
by June 6.''
   He said he did not know why the ship was then off the line
again, spending at least three days around June 10-13 at anchor
outside Bahrain, before it returned to its duty station in the
southern gulf.
   Some of the Vincennes' crew said they were puzzled why the ship
had been ordered to make a rush departure from San Diego after only
90 hours of port preparation, and on arrival spent five days in the
Gulf of Oman, ``sailing in circles'' as one officer described it,
before entering the Strait of Hormuz.
   Many Navy ships, especially those with sophisticated electronics
and other equipment, have civlian experts, known as ``tech reps,''
aboard to maintain and repair the gear. Most are employees of the
manufacturers.
   There were no such representatives aboard the Vincennes. Its
officers told journalists who rode the ship into the gulf that the
crew was fully capable of maintaining and repairing the ship's
complicated systems.
   The Vincennes was riding at anchor off Bahrain for a third day
Friday, but two other warships that contributed data to the
investigation of the jetliner incident, the frigate Elmer
Montgomery and the missile frigate John H. Sides, returned to duty
in the gulf.
   Both had been nearby when the aircraft was shot down. The
disaster followed a clash involving the Vincennes, the Elmer
Montgomery and some Iranian speedboats, two of which were sunk,
U.S. officials said.
   Computer tapes from the warships are being sent back to the
United States for analysis at the Navy's Surface warfare Center in
Dahlgren, Va. U.S. sources said they could offer no indication of
when a team of six military investigators sent here to investigate
the incident would complete their task and return to the United
States.
   The team, headed by Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, arrived here
on Tuesday with orders to deliver a report in 15 days if possible.

<HEAD>Namphy Voids Haitian Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Less than three weeks after he
seized power in a military coup, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy shredded
Haiti's popular Constitution and dealt a major blow to the
country's move toward democracy.
   Namphy said in a live television broadcast Friday night from the
Presidential Palace that a new constitution will be written soon.
He said the one approved by a massive voter turnout in March 1987
was ``unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and
emotion.''
   ``It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of
rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which
nearly 70 percent of the population in the country is vegetating,''
Namphy said.
   ``The future depends on what we do, or refuse to do now,'' he
said, adding that the new constitution will take ``Haitian reality
into account.''
   Namphy pledged his government would respect freedom of speech
and assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and
political parties.
   Port-au-Prince remained calm late Friday night, as it was after
the June 19 coup that sent President Leslie Manigat into exile.
   Namphy said the current constitution _ the most liberal in
Haiti's 184-year history and ardently defended by civic and
political groups _ introduced foreign elements to Haitian
traditions.
   The constitution, approved by 99 percent of Haitians who voted
in a March 29, 1987 referendum, prohibited close Duvalier
collaborators from running for public office for a period of 10
years. It also provided for an independent Electoral Council to
organize national elections.
   During the 20-minute speech, Namphy was flanked by Manigat's
Cabinet ministers and top aides to former dictators Jean-Claude
Duvalier and his father Francois Duvalier.
   After Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in 1986, Namphy ruled
until Manigat's inauguration last February, a period tainted by
army killings of peasants, demonstrators and opposition leaders.
   On Nov. 29, 1987, Duvalierists shot and hacked to death at least
34 voters while soldiers looked on and in some cases escorted the
gunmen. The same day Namphy dissolved the independent Electoral
Council, then hand-picked another council, which ran the
fraud-riddled January vote resulting in Manigat's election.
   Namphy spoke in the same Hall of Busts where Manigat had held
his three monthly news conferences. The entire High Command of the
Haitian military was present, including Col. Jean-Claude Paul,
indicted earlier this year by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges on drug smuggling.
   Sitting in the front row among the invited guests were three
former presidential candidates, Francois Latortue, Gerard
Phillipe-Auguste _ Manigat's minister of agriculture _ and Gregoire
Eugene, now Namphy's adviser on constitutional law.
   Also present were two Duvalier supporters who had been rejected
as presidential candidates by the former independent Electoral
Council, Claude Raymond and Clovis Desinor.
   Asked if he thought the new constitution would promote democracy
in Haiti, Philippe-Auguste responded: ``Democracy is one thing, a
constitution is another. ... All depends on whether the law,
written or unwritten, is obeyed.''
   Eugene insisted that civil liberties would be respected under
the new constitution. He said he opposed the constitutional
provision banning Duvalier suporters from running for office.
   ``I think it is better to let the people decide for themselves
whether they want to vote for former Duvalierists,'' he said.

   He survived Vietnam, a dangerous tour as an
undercover decoy cop and two bouts with cancer that cost him his
legs. Now Bruce Neberieza is fighting to keep a desk job that
officials contend he can no longer handle.
   ``They say that because I use two canes, I can't defend
myself,'' the 43-year-old Neberieza said Friday.
   Since his first amputation in 1980, Neberieza has been assigned
to the front desk of a local precinct. The Police Department has
tried since last summer to strip away that job, either by
suspending him or putting him on medical disability, claiming he is
medically unfit for the post.
   The city told Neberieza on Tuesday it was suspending him without
pay or insurance until the city Police Board rules on whether he
should be put on disability pension.
   ``What has been filed with the Police Board are specifications
stating that, based on evaluations, he is not able to fully perform
the functions of a police officer,'' said Robert Karmgard, the
city's assistant corporation counsel.
   But Circuit Judge Thomas Rakowski ruled Thursday that Neberieza
is entitled to a Police Board hearing before the board rules, and
extended an order he first issued in October that bars the city
from taking Neberieza off the payroll without such a hearing.
   ``It makes no sense for a person who has performed his duties,
is performing his duties, has a doctor's affidavit that he can do a
desk job, to be denied (salary and medical insurance) without a
hearing,'' the judge said.
   The Police Board hearing is scheduled for July 15.
   Neberieza, who supports his wife and three children on his
$35,000 salary, said he wants to stay on active duty another 15
years to qualify for full pension. On disability, he would receive
half pay for four years, and a small annuity thereafter.
   ``I can't afford to settle for a small annuity,'' he said. ``I
have a mortgage and bills like anyone else.
   ``I feel I fit the definition of a policeman. I've done
everything they've asked me to do.''
   ``He has proved he can do the job,'' said John Dineen, president
of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police. ``He has been doing it for
seven years.''
   Neberieza joined the police force 15 years ago after a Vietnam
tour with the Air Force.
   He eventually was assigned to an undercover unit of decoys who
prowled subways, acting like drunks or sleeping commuters to lure
muggers.
   But in 1980, his right leg was removed at the hip because of
cancer.
   That meant a limited-duty job; he was assigned to a neighborhood
police station's front desk.
   Five years later, he developed heart trouble and had quadruple
bypass surgery.
   It wasn't until last year, when Neberieza lost his left leg
below the knee to cancer, that the city decided it no longer could
use him.
   ``The two requirements to remain on the job are that they must
be able to ambulate independently and be able to fire a firearm. If
he can't protect himself, how could he protect the citizen?''
Police Commander Hubert Holton, the department's personnel
commander, told the Chicago Tribune.
   Neberieza, who walks on two artificial legs, said he is no more
disabled than any number of other handicapped officers performing
limited-duty jobs.
   His attorney, Anne Burke, said the department has 600 ``light
duty'' jobs and Neberieza easily could fill one of them. Except for
his court appearance, she said, he hasn't missed a day of work.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov
says the Red Army will withdraw from foreign lands by the end of
the century, but a U.S. official says a Soviet pullout may be
imminent in Hungary.
   A State Department official said Friday that there are
``increasing indications'' of a unilateral withdrawal from Hungary,
which was invaded by Soviet troops in 1956 to crush an uprising.
   Reports of a possible Soviet withdrawal have circulated for a
year and a half. The State Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said its information is based on U.S.
intelligence reports.
   Ryzhkov, speaking to Western reporters Friday, gave no
indication that the Soviet union was preparing a unilateral
withdrawal from an East bloc nation before 2000.
   The Soviet government chief told Western reporters such moves
could come only in the context of a general withdrawal involving
Western forces as well.
   He said his government feels no armies should be on foreign
territory _ U.S., British or Soviet.
   ``Our proposal is this: let us take out all the armies,'' he
said. ``The armies in Czechoslovakia are part of the Warsaw Pact
armies. Let us agree on a radical solution in the West and in the
East.''
   Red Army units are stationed in several Soviet bloc countries,
including Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley cautioned that after
announcing troop withdrawals form East Germany in 1983, the Soviets
built their forces in that country back to the same levels within
three years.
   Currently, four Soviet tank and motorized rifle divisions remain
in Hungary. The troops are not on the front lines opposite NATO
forces, however, because Hungary is bordered to the west by three
Warsaw Pact nations and politically neutral Yugoslavia and Austria.
   Even with a withdrawal, said Oakley, the Warsaw Pact would hold
a 2-1 advantage over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in
tanks, artillery and armored personnel vehicles.
   In talks with reporters, Ryzkhov also seemed to dash hopes for
any rehabilitation soon of Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist
Party leader in Czechoslovakia who is famed for his liberal
policies.
   Ryzhkov confirmed that at the recent Communist Party conference,
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev stressed the need for
``socialism with a human face.''
   That phrase was used to describe Dubcek's ``Prague spring'' of
1968, which provoked a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in August of
that year and cost Dubcek his job as party chief in Prague.
   Western reporters asked Ryzhkov, who attended a three-day
economic conference that ended Thursday, whether the time had not
come for Dubcek to be rehabilitated.
   He replied: ``The rehabilitation of Dubcek, that is a question
for Czechoslovakia. I do not intend to deal with the internal
problems of Czechoslovakia. As far as I know the Czechoslovak party
does not intend to deal with that.''
   Dubcek, now 66, said in an Austrian Television interview
broadcast Thursday that the current leadership in Prague should
adopt Gorbachev's reforms. Most are similar to reforms Dubcek
introduced here 20 years ago.

   Evert Clark, who specialized in aviation,
science and space in 40 years of reporting for publications
including The New York Times and Newsweek, has died. He was 62.
   Clark, who was technical news editor for Business Week and other
magazines serviced by the McGraw-Hill World News Bureau for the
last 10 years, died Thursday at Montgomery General Hospital in
suburban Maryland after surgery for an aneurysm.
   Born in Gainesville, Ga., Clark began his career in journalism
in 1947 as a reporter and editor for the Durham, N.C., Morning
Herald.
   He became a feature writer for the Washington Daily News in 1948
before he turned his passion for aviation and space into a position
as the first space editor for Aviation Week and Space Technology
Magazine in 1956.
   He covered the U.S. effort to land a man on the moon and was
cited with an award by the National Space Club in 1969 for his
``penetrating, consistently informed and lucid writing.''
   He joined The New York Times in 1963 as an aviation and space
reporter in 1963 and moved to Newsweek in 1968, covering science
and technology as well as the Watergate break-in during his 10
years in the magazine's Washington bureau. He wrote a book titled
``Contrabandista'' with Newsweek colleague Nicholas Horrock on the
drug trade.
   Clark served in the Navy from 1944 to 1946 and graduated from
the University of North Carolina in 1947. He lived most recently in
Gaithersburg, Md.
   He is survived by his wife, June; one son, David S. Clark; and
two daughters, Kristin L. Dougherty and Amy S. Bockhaus.

   The U.S. downing of an Iranian jetliner has
prompted airlines flying over the Persian Gulf to seek ways to
avoid military confrontations.
   The issue topped the agenda when technical experts from six
major airlines operating passenger flights in the gulf area held a
regular meeting at the Geneva headquarters of the International Air
Transport Association.
   Thursday's session also was attended by an official of the
International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that on
July 13 is to consider Iran's request for an investigation into the
tragedy.
   Association officials would not comment when asked about the
possibility of rerouting flights. They also declined to talk about
reported complaints of the U.S. Navy's contradicting plane
instructions from civilian air controllers.
   ``We reviewed procedures in the gulf area to see if the airlines
could help improve civil-military coordination,'' said Norman
Jackson, head of the group's technical department.
   ``We saw a number of areas where we could be helpful,'' he said
in a telephone interview. He declined to elaborate.
   Asked whether rerouting was discussed, he said: ``Any routing
changes through the gulf is a matter for ICAO _ the governments.''
   But the association, an industry association grouping most of
the world's airlines, seemed certain to be considering the idea,
too.
   ``We are in close touch with ICAO on technical aspects,''
Jackson said.
   Navy officials say they were unable to communicate with or
identify Iran Air flight 655 on Sunday before blasting it out of
the sky with a missile. All 290 people aboard were killed.
   The technical group did not discuss details of the incident
because it is still under investigation, Jackson said.
   ``We have no firm information to work with and see no point in
speculating,'' he said.
   Jackson declined to identify the airlines that took part in the
one-day meeting or the ICAO representative.

<TEXT>
   The former top education adviser to Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis received a 2{-year prison term and was ordered to repay
the $80,000 he admitted he helped skim from an adult education
program he ran.
   Gerard T. Indelicato, 42, of Norwood was ordered Friday by U.S.
District Judge Douglas Woodlock to surrender to federal officials
Aug. 5. Woodlock did not decide where Indelicato will serve his
term.
   The sentence was half the five-year term Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ralph Gants had sought.
   ``He saw the hopes and dreams of these people for adult
education to be his hopes and dreams for a Cape Cod house or a
boat,'' Gants said.
   Indelicato administered an adult education program designed to
help immigrants and the illiterate.
   He was considered the mastermind of a plan that involved paying
inflated classroom rent and receiving some of the money back,
taking the salaries of fictitious employees and skimming funds
indended to pay for classroom renovations.
   He pleaded guilty in April to five charges of conspiracy, mail
fraud and tax evasion in a scheme with three others accused of
bilking the program of some $80,000.
   Indelicato would be eligible to seek parole in 10 months, Gants
said, but would likely serve between a year and 18 months.
   In a plea bargaining agreement, Indelicato testified in the
trial of Michael Freedman, whom federal prosecutors called one of
the scheme's ``minor players.'' Freedman, whose trial ended in a
mistrial, pleaded guilty to a single count of mail fraud in a plea
bargain last month and received a suspended sentence.
   Before Indelicato's sentencing, he apologized ``to the citizens
who entrusted me with public responsibility because I did not live
up to that.''
   His case centered around activities that began between 1979 and
early 1983 and ended a few weeks before Dukakis named him as his
chief education adviser.
   Indelicato was the highest-ranking member of Dukakis'
administration to face criminal indictment. The Democratic
presidential contender condemned Indelicato's activities and said
his administration is cooperating with all investigations,
including two pending state probes.
   Woodlock also sentenced Joseph Indelicato, Gerard's older
brother, to two years in prison on a related conviction. He also
must pay a $22,000 fine.
   Sentencing was delayed for a third convicted conspirator,
Antonio B. Perrotta.
   The judge said Indelicato also is cooperating with a pending
federal investigation, the details of which have not been revealed.
   Earlier this week, Indelicato pleaded innocent to state charges
stemming from his activities as Dukakis' education adviser and from
his term as president of Bridgewater State College. The charges
include forgery, larceny, conflict of interest, tax evasion and
theft.

   David Atlee Phillips, 65, former chief of
Latin American and Caribbean operations for the Central
Intelligence Agency and later a vocal defender of the CIA, has died.
   Phillips, who died Thursday at his home, had suffered from
cancer.
   A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Phillips became a public defender
of the agency following his retirement from clandestine service in
1975. His actions came when the agency suffered criticism for a
number of abuses, including charges of domestic spying.
   He undertook the one-man public relations campaign after a
discussion with his 15-year-old daughter in which he revealed his
true occupation _ an undercover intelligence officer. ``But that's
dirty,'' was her response.
   A former actor who served as an Army Air Force gunner in World
War II, Phillips escaped from a German prisoner-of-war camp after
being shot down over Austria in 1944. After the war, Phillips
purchased an English language newspaper in Chile, where he was
recruited by the agency.
   During his quarter of a century with the CIA, Phillips served as
station chief in Venezuela, Brazil and the Dominican Republic; he
operated a radio station on an island off the coast of Cuba in the
early months of Fidel Castro's rule, and did undercover duty in
Guatemala, Mexico City and Beirut.
   Phillips was founder and president of the Association of Foreign
Intelligence Officers, a frequent speaker of the college lecture
circuit, and the author of ``The Nightwatch: 25 Years of Peculiar
Service.''
   He is survived by his wife, Virginia Phillips, of Bethesda, Md.,
four children and three stepchildren.

<HEAD>Death Toll Rises To 115, Reports Say 5 Million Marooned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Torrential rains swelled rivers and
sparked flooding that crushed homes and capsized boats, marooning
millions of people and killing up to 115, authorities said.
   The Water Development Board warned that the flooding that has
plagued the country for the past week could worsen in the next two
days.
   The board said in a statement issued Friday that all rivers in
the Brahmaputra basin were rising from the rain and the onrush of
waters from northeastern Indian states.
   The army was called out Friday to assist with rescue opertions.
Press reports said as many as 5 million people were marooned in
northeastern districts.
   ``The number of marooned people is so huge you cannot bring all
of them to safer places,'' said an official in the town of
Sunamganj, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sunamganj is 112 miles northeast of the capital at Dhaka.
   Vice President Nurul Islam flew to the Sunamganj area by
helicopter Friday to assess flood damage. The aircraft was unable
to land because no suitable dry ground could be found, an aide said
today on condition of anonymity.
   Twenty-four more deaths occurred Friday, according to local
government officials and newspaper reports, raising the unofficial
death toll to at least 115.
   The government confirmed 10 new deaths and said its official
count stood at 60.
   The New Nation, an independent English-language daily, and
Ittefaq, a Bengali-language daily, blamed the deaths on houses
collapsing and boats capsizing.
   Most of the deaths were reported in the northeast, which has
been hardest hit by the floods.
   Bangladesh, one of the poorest nations in the world with a
population of more than 105 million, often suffers flooding during
the annual monsoon rain season.
   Its low-lying land is vulnerable because not enough dams have
been constructed on major rivers to control water flow.
   Press reports said rescue efforts were hampered by relentless
rain.
   Thousands of people were trapped on rooftops or high ground
without food, press reports said. The Ittefaq newspaper said there
were reports of outbreaks of diarrhea and other water-borne
diseases because of a shortage of pure drinking water.
   The northeastern tea-growing district of Sylhet was all but cut
off from the rest of the country Friday when the main highway
bridge washed away. Air service to the region was suspended earlier
in the week when runways flooded.
   In Hobiganj, just southwest of Sylhet, a tributary of the
Brahmaputra River was flowing more than 5 feet above flood level,
the highest in memory, the Water Development Board said.
   In Moulvibazar in the district just south of Sylhet, town
leaders urged residents to leave for higher ground as the town's
protective embankment threatened to cave in, officials there said.

<HEAD>Window Service to be Restored to Normal Levels in September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service will be restoring full
window service that was cut at the nation's post offices in
February to save money.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank said on Friday that managers
have found enough savings in other areas to re-open windows Sept.
10 to ``the same level of service that existed prior to Feb. 13.''
   Frank said local managers will have the discretion to decide
what changes are best for their community. For example, in some
areas evening hours may be expanded, while in others an extra clerk
may be put on at busy times instead of having longer hours with
fewer clerks.
   The cuts in window service, one step to trim spending by $160
million, amounted to about half a day a week, and in many areas
that meant closing offices on Saturdays.
   Other communities had their post offices closed one morning or
one afternoon a week.
   The changes drew considerable criticism, particularly since they
occurred just before an increase in postal rates.
   Frank has struggled in his four months in office to explain that
the rate hike was initiated more than a year ago because of growing
deficits, while the service cuts were required when Congress
ordered a sudden reduction in postal spending.
   In a related development later Friday, the Postal Service
announced it was suspending all work on a controversial contract
with Texas computer billionaire H. Ross Perot, who was studying
ways to improve the agency's efficiency.
   Under terms of the deal with Perot, the initial $500,000 phase
of the work was to be followed by a second phase in which payment
would be based on a percentage of any savings realized by the
Postal Service. That apparently open-ended deal has generated
controversy.
   At least two competitors of Perot complained to the General
Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals, which ordered
the pact suspended. The Postal Service, however, has argued that
board has no jurisdiction over its activities.
   The Postal Service said late Friday it believed its contract
with Perot was a ``valuable and innovative approach'' to making
operations more efficient, but that it suspended the contract
because of GSA board's order.
   The dispute probably will have to be settled in federal court.

<HEAD>Assembly Passes Laws To Subpoena Ex-President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Assembly today passed two
laws that could force former President Chun Doo-hwan to testify on
charges of corruption that allegedly occurred during his seven-year
tenure.
   Government party officials said they would ask President Roh
Tae-woo to veto the laws approved by the opposition-controlled
legislature. The proposals were passed 164-125, with three
absentions.
   If vetoed, the bills likely would die because the opposition
lacks the two-thirds legislative majority needed to override a
presidential veto. South Korea's three predominant opposition
parties together control 166 seats in the 299-member National
Assembly.
   The governing Democratic Justice Party criticized the proposals
and said Roh would certainly veto them. Party officials argued the
bills are unconstitutional.
   ``It is highly regrettable that the opposition rammed the law
bills through the Assembly in disregard of our repeated warnings
that they would be vetoed,'' Democratic Justice Party floor leader
Kim Yoon-hwan said.
   Kim Won-ki, floor leader for the Party for Peace and Democracy,
the largest opposition group, said he doubted Roh would veto the
bills.
   ``I don't think President Roh would veto the bills. He has
repeatedly promised that there would be no sanctuary in
investigating past corruption and irregularities,'' the opposition
leader said.
   The legislation contains a provision that empowers the National
Assembly to subpoena witnesses with writs of arraignment issued by
courts of law.
   Opposition politicians said such a law is needed to compel all
witnesses to testify in South Korea's huge government corruption
case.
   They said privately that the main targets of the laws are Chun
and his family.
   Roh and other top government officials maintain that they would
support efforts to ferret out all past corruption and
irregularities under Chun but the president oppose any moves to
make the Chun testify or stand trial.
   Chun, whose term ended in February, has come under public fire
for alleged involvement in large-scale financial scandals. One of
his brothers, Chun Kyung-hwan, was arrested in March for embezzling
millions of dollars.
   Several parliamentary committees were organized this week to
look into alleged corruption and other problems under Chun.
   One committee is charged with probing a 1980 anti-government
uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left nearly 200 dead
and more than 800 others injured, according to official count.
   Opposition and dissident groups allege that Chun, along with Roh
and the United States, helped mastermind the brutal suppression of
the uprising.

   Astronaut Charles Bolden says his
two rides in an escape basket down a ``slide-for-life'' wire should
give other astronauts and workers confidence that the space shuttle
launch pad emergency system is safe.
   Bolden made the first trip alone Friday, then was joined by two
safety workers for the second zip down the wire from the 195-foot
level of shuttle launch pad 39B. A platform at that level provides
access to the crew cabin of space shuttle Discovery.
   ``It was not a thrill ride, it was a very gentle ride; it looks
worse than it is,'' Bolden told reporters.
   It was the first time humans had ridden the basket since it was
installed several years ago for the shuttle program. Astronauts and
launch pad personnel would use the system in case of a fire, fuel
or gas leak or other emergency on the pad that gave them time to
reach the baskets.
   The baskets, dropping at 50 mph, are halted abruptly at the
bottom of the wire by a braking system, backed up by a rope net.
There are seven baskets, each designed to hold three people.
   Each trip Friday took about 20 seconds, with a quick run to an
underground bunker at the bottom taking another 15 seconds.
   Until recently, some NASA officials felt the swift ride would be
risky and should be attempted only in an actual emergency. Earlier
tests were run with sandbags substituting for humans.
   But with the added emphasis on safety after the loss of the
shuttle Challenger and its seven crew members, the space agency
decided to test the basket system with humans after making several
improvements.
   Bolden and the two safety workers volunteered for the job.
   ``I've always had confidence in the system, but I felt it was
important to put someone in the basket to show people that it
worked the way it is designed,'' Bolden said.
   ``Maybe people were hesitant about using it before, but I think
this test will give them confidence and they will have no qualms
about getting in the baskets if they have to,'' he added.
   Among the system's improvements were the addition of two
baskets; a side exit in each basket to ease exiting; added
flame-protective material; and an anti-rollback brake to ensure the
basket stops as quickly as possible.
   Discovery was moved to the launch pad on Monday to prepare for
the first shuttle launch since Challenger exploded after takeoff on
Jan. 28, 1986. The launch is scheduled for early September.

<HEAD>Thailand Calls For International Pressure To Prevent Return of

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand's foreign minister said today
that an international peacekeeping force could prevent the Khmer
Rouge from retaking power in Cambodia after Vietnamese occupation
forces leave.
   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila said Thailand and its
Southeast Asian allies do not want to see a return of the Khmer
Rouge, who killed up to 3 million people when they ruled Cambodia
from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
   Previously, officials of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, which strongly backs a three-party resistance coalition
that includes the Khmer Rouge, did not issue a strong public stand
on the issue.
   Siddhi spoke at a news conference ending a three-day annual
conference of foreign ministers of ASEAN.
   ``I think the Khmer Rouge know that they cannot come back
because we don't support them to come back,'' he said. ``So I think
we can use a lot of pressure besides the peacekeeping force.
   ``They know that ASEAN ... is trying to support a resolution of
the Cambodian problem by not supporting the return of the Khmer
Rouge,'' he said.
   At the same news conference, Secretary of State George Shultz
said that during his upcoming visit to China, he plans to stress
America's opposition to the Khmer Rouge. China is the Khmer Rouge's
main source of arms.
   ``The Chinese attitude toward the Khmer Rouge and the nature of
the continuing support to an overall Cambodian settlement will be a
very important factor, and recent statements by China are
encouraging in that regard,'' Shultz said.
   Also important to a political settlement, Shultz said, is the
Soviet Union's influence on Vietnam. He said the Kremlin gives
Vietnam $2 billion in military aid a year.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 until the Vietnamese
invasion in December 1978. During that time, they killed millions
of Cambodians. The group is known for its radical agrarian
communism.
   Shultz reiterated U.S. support for a central role in any
settlement for Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a former Cambodian head of
state who now leads the guerrilla coalition. The third group in the
resistance is led by Son Sann, a Western-leaning politician.
   Shultz said he hoped the Cambodian peace talks planned for
Indonesia on July 25 would be successful. The talks are to involve
the guerrilla groups, the Vietnamese-installed government in
Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and the ASEAN countries.
   Vietnam has said it will pull its estimated 140,000 troops out
of Cambodia by 1990 and has begun withdrawing 50,000 troops in an
operation to be completed in December.
   Delegates said ASEAN ministers did not discuss the Khmer Rouge
issue during their conference on Monday and Tuesday. Bit it became
a dominant topic when the Western dialogue partners joined in
consultations starting Thursday.
   ASEAN groups Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Brunei. Its dialogue partners are the United
States, Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the European
Community.

   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has chosen
his fourth government since his Socialist Party won a landslide
electoral victory in October 1982.
   Government spokesman Javier Solana said the new cabinet, which
includes the first two women named to a Gonazalez government, would
be sworn in on Tuesday. Seven cabinet posts changed hands and 10
others remained unchanged.
   The announcement of the cabinet selections Friday came after
reports of conflicts among education, justice, transportation and
industry ministers.
   The most notable change came in the Interior Ministry, where
labor activist and Socialist Party executive committee member Jose
Luis Corcuera replaced Jose Barrionuevo, who moved to the Ministry
of Transport, Tourism and Communications.
   Also named were were:
   _Matilde Fernandez, as social welfare minister, a new post.
   _Rosa Conde Gutierrez del Alamo, government spokeswoman.
   _Jorge Semprun, culture minister.
   _Enrique Mugica Herzog, justice minister.
   _Claudio Aranzadi, industry minister.
   _Solana, minister of education.
   Spokesmen for the country's largest trade unions, the
Socialist-led General Workers Union and the Communist-oriented
Comisiones Obreras, said they did not believe the changes would
alter Gonzalez's centrist economic policies.
   Both unions have made strong calls for Gonzalez to take a more
left-wing approach to economic issues.
   Antonio Hernandez Mancha, leader of the largest opposition
party, the conservative Popular Alliance, told reporters Friday
``the new cabinet represents a very little change, and recognizes
the rightness of our party's views that basic government services
had collapsed.''
   Police unions praised Barrionuevo on Friday. But human rights
groups have criticized him for alleged reluctance to investigate
charges police brutality and misconduct.
   A series of strikes last spring by teachers demanding higher
wages and protests by students and university professors over
reform programs undermined the standing of former Education
Minister Jose Maria Maravall.
   Conservative opposition leaders and Justice Ministry employees
angry over low pay had attacked former Justice Minister Fernando
Ledesma as ineffective.
   The removal of Transport, Tourism and Communications Minister
Abel Caballero was viewed as a response to criticism over a failure
to improve public transportion and telephone service.
   No changes were made among the other 10 cabinet ministers, which
includes Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra, Foreign Affairs
Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez and Defense Minister Narcis
Serra.

   Rescuers today called off their

Surveillance Authority.
   Aircraft have found no sign of the vessel, she said.
   ``The planes have searched over a wide area but haven't come up
with anything,'' Jorgensen said. ``We are now just in a
wait-and-see situation.
   ``There is still hope that the Singa Sea might simply have
veered off course to avoid storms and have suffered from radio
failure,'' she said.
   The ship was carrying a load of mineral sand when it was in an
area where 50-knot winds were recorded.

<HEAD>Personnel Shift Indicates Partial Change Of Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Nationalist Party indicated
today that several, but not all, of the island's old-guard leaders
are to retire.
   Ten of the 31 members of the Nationalist's policy-making Central
Standing Committee were named to the Central Advisory Committee,
which is composed primarily of retired officials.
   Nationalist Party spokesman Raymond Tai told reporters that
advisory panel members will not sit on the new Central Standing
Committee to be named Thursday at the end of the weeklong 13th
party congress.
   The average age of current Central Standing Committee members is
70, with seven members more than 80 years old. More than half fled
to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek from the Chinese mainland when his
Nationalist government was routed by the Communists in 1949.
   Leaders of the Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang,
have stressed the importance of promoting younger party members who
represent the Taiwan public.
   Young party members have criticized old-guard conservatives from
the mainland for not being enthusiastic about the liberalization
policies initiated by President Chiang Ching-kuo before his death
in January.
   Chiang, the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, lifted martial law,
allowed new political parties and eased a ban on travel to mainland
China.
   Still to be changed is the parliamentary system in which
mainland Chinese Nationalists hold a majority of seats to back the
party's claim that it remains the rightful ruler of China.
   President Lee Teng-hui, who was acclaimed the first native
Taiwanese party chairman Friday, has vowed to continue the process
of democratic change and liberalization but has moved cautiously in
past months as he has sought to consolidate power.
   The new members of the advisory committee, proposed by Lee and
approved by the congress, include five of seven octagenarians on
the Central Standing Committee.
   Three media executives on the Central Standing Committee who
have said they want to give way to a younger leadership also were
named to the advisory panel.
   But Premier Yu Kuo-hwa and Shen Chang-huan, secretary to the
president, were not named to the advisory group. The two
74-year-olds are influential conservatives and liberals fear they
could block reforms.
   ``This will be a very conservative restructuring,'' said
political journalist Antonio Chiang. But he added that the
conservative old-guard's power base was dwindling and younger
members would likely be more willing to speak up.
   The 1,209 congress delegates will elect a 180-member Central
Committee on Tuesday. For the first time, the vote will not be
limited to candidates proposed by the party.
   The new Central Committee will meet Thursday to name the new
Central Standing Committee. A Cabinet overhaul is expected later.

<HEAD>Migrant Workers Become Drought Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   The drought has claimed yet another group of victims: the
migrant farm workers who find their labor is unneeded as the crops
they normally pick shrivel in the dusty fields of the Midwest.
   ``We want to cry,'' said Norma Nieto, who recently traveled with
14 others from her home in Brownsville, Texas, to Wisconsin. ``We
need the money and we have come so far. It will be sad to go back
in worse shape than when we came.''
   Ms. Nieto, 21, said the group stopped in Michigan first. They
found a little work there, but no housing.
   Now Ms. Nieto and her family and friends are stranded in
Wisconsin, where officials estimate 4,000 to 5,000 migrant workers
are victims of the nation's worst drought since the 1930s.
   Ms. Nieto's mother, Concepcion Zamorano, told a translator:
``Each year we leave our home wondering what is going to happen,
and hoping we will have a good year. This year, it's been real
bad.''
   The group includes eight adults and seven children who took the
harvest route north from Texas to work in beet fields of Sandusky,
Mich. Twelve of the 15 are Zamorano family members.
   Roberto Silva, a migrant farm worker who arrived in Hoopeston,
Ill., on June 25 with his family of 12, is in no better shape.
   ``We were working in Michigan and heard rumors there was a lot
of work down here,'' he said. ``Since there has been no rain, there
is no work in the fields yet,'' said Silva, 40, of Edinburg, Texas.
   In Hoopeston, the Illinois Migrant Council so far has registered
about 70 Mexican-American families _ nearly 300 people, said
council supervisor Hada Reed.
   For the past 25 years, Silva's family has made the trek to
Michigan for farm work. This year they found little, so they headed
to Hoopeston, an east-central Illinois town of 6,400.
   But the parched summer stymied them.
   ``There is very little sweet corn because of the drought, and as
far as I'm concerned there will be no lima bean or pumpkin
harvest,'' Ms. Reed said.
   Most of the workers earn the minimum wage of $3.35 per hour.
What they make during seven months on the road must carry them to
the next harvest season.
   ``Some have been here since June, and have worked two or three
days at the most _ they're getting checks of $40,'' Ms. Reed said.
Many have been living in parks, she added.
   David Granadas and his family _ his wife and their five
children, eight brothers, his parents, an uncle and a cousin _ have
been renting a home in Oxford, Ind., about 40 miles to the east.
   ``But I am worried because I have to pay the rent,'' which is
$250 a month, said Granadas, who has been looking for work since
June 20.
   Wisconsin's United Migrant Opportunity Services, a support
agency for migrant workers, appealed this week to Gov. Tommy G.
Thompson for emergency money for food, shelter and transportation
for the itinerants who can't find work.
   The agency's $73,000 assistance budget for 1988 will be
exhausted in a month, executive director Lupe Martinez said.
   Thompson's office said Friday the request was being reviewed.
   This time last year, Mrs. Zamorano, her husband, Justo, and two
of their children worked at a cannery in Belgium, Wis., about 30
miles north of Milwaukee.
   They had full-time jobs on the assembly line and housing in the
company's migrant camp. By the end of the season, they earned
$7,000.
   This year, the Zamoranos have free housing but little to do.
   United Migrant Opportunity Services has provided groceries and a
little money for gasoline and spare parts for the 1976 pickup in
which the group of 15 made the 1,500-mile, three-day trip from
Brownsville.
   But without the money for the return trip, even giving up and
going home seems impossible.

   The pilot of the Iranian jetliner the U.S.
Navy shot down last weekend had a 5-year-old daughter who is an
American citizen, and family members say explaining the way her
father died won't be easy.
   ``She was proud to be an American,'' said Nahy Sadeghi, the
sister of pilot Mohsen Rezaian's wife. The child was born in
Oklahoma while Mrs. Rezaian was visiting her sister.
   ``She always said to the other children, `I'm the American.' How
is she (the mother) going to tell her that her father was shot down
by Americans when she's an American?'' Mrs. Sadeghi said Friday.
The Rezaians had two other children.
   Mrs. Sagedhi and her husband, Kamran, said the pilot considered
the United States his second home.
   ``He liked the United States very much,'' Mrs. Sadeghi said.
   ``He had a good time here,'' added Kamran Sadeghi, who said
Rezaian was trained in Texas by Boeing Co.
   The Sadeghis said because of the increased U.S. presence in the
Persian Gulf, they knew their brother-in-law's job had become more
dangerous.
   Even so, said Mrs. Sadeghi, she considered his job routine. She
was a stewardess in Iran from 1968 to 1973. ``I'm familiar with the
flights. They are all so crowded.''
   Kamran Sadeghi came to the United States in 1971 to attend the
University of Oklahoma and now works for the school as a computer
programmer.
   The couple said they aren't sure who to blame for the incident
Sunday, in which the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus A300, which
carried 290 people.
   ``All Iranians do not represent the Iranian government,'' Mrs.
Sadeghi said. ``Same with the Americans and the American
government. They are following their own policies. I blame the
situation. It's the war that made the American Navy to be there.''
   Mrs. Sadeghi said her sister has been living in West Germany for
10 months because of the fighting between Iran and Iraq.
   The Sadeghis had a strong reaction to early reports that the
downed flight was a ``suicide mission,'' with orders to crash into
the Vincennes.
   ``No, no. If you had known him, if you could talk to him once,
you would never imagine that,'' Mrs. Sadeghi said. ``It's not even
possible. He was a very good human being. He valued people. He
valued people's lives.
   ``He loved his family, he loved his kids,'' Mrs. Sadeghi said.
``He was very responsible and would never do anything to jeopardize
his own life.''
   Now, Mrs. Sadeghi said, her concerns lie with her sister, and
how she ``can survive this with her children.'' She said the
children had not been told yet how their father died.
   The couple said that if the United States offers to provide
financial help, the payment should go directly to the families.
   ``If the United States pays them money, I don't want them to pay
the government of Iran,'' Sadeghi said. ``If they do, they should
pay the victims directly. Iran needs money. Without it, maybe it
would stop the war.''

<HEAD>Government Proposes Regional Black Councils</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has proposed
the creation of regional legislative councils to address matters
related solely to blacks. Anti-apartheid activists condemned the
proposal.
   Blacks would elect members to the regional councils under the
proposed Extension of Political Participation Bill, which was
published Friday in the official Government Gazette.
   The bill did not specify how many councils would be established.
President P.W. Botha would have the power to veto bills passed by
the councils.
   Presently, blacks can vote only in municipal elections and in 10
homelands. Elected black officials are widely viewed in their
communities as collaborators with the white-led government.
   South Africa's 26 million blacks have no representation in
Parliament and cannot vote in national elections. Its 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   The proposed councils would have authority over regional matters
concerning blacks such as education, welfare, local government and
community development.
   ``It is the government's viewpoint that all communities should
participate in the government process on the different levels,''
said Chris Heunis, minister of constitutional development and
planning.
   Helen Suzman, member of Parliament for the Progressive Federal
Party, said the proposal was ``one of those hopeless efforts to
avoid the realities of the South African situation.''
   ``The duplication of (government) structures to run this country
has become totally absurd,'' she said.
   Anti-apartheid activists have rejected all the government's
major political reform proposals in recent years, saying they
entrench white domination and continue to divide political
participation by race.
   The government is seeking comment on the latest proposal before
deciding whether it will be introduced in Parliament, Heunis said.

<TEXT>
   The Malaysian Bar Council today
urged acting Lord President Justice Abdul Hamid Omar, the country's
highest ranking judge, to resign and said it would begin contempt
of court proceedings against him.
   The unprecedented action by the Bar Council, which represents
2,500 lawyers in Malaysia, was the latest move in a battle between
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the judiciary, the only branch
of government still independent of his control.
   The battle began May 26 when the government suspended the
previous Lord President, Mohamad Salleh Abas, and accused him of
``lack of dignity, judicial propriety and impartiality.''
   Salleh had written to King Sultan Mahmood Iskandar and
complained that Mahathir had been attacking the judiciary.
   Last Saturday, five Supreme Court judges ordered a tribunal
hearing the charges against Salleh not to advise the king on
whether to remove Salleh permanently until it received further
orders.
   On Wednesday, the king suspended the five judges and ordered
them to face a tribunal that will decide whether they will be
removed permanently.
   He acted on a request from Hamid, who alleged that the five were
guilty of misbehavior.
   ``By his recent actions ... Hamid Omar has shown himself as
unfit for judicial office,'' the council said.
   ``The Malaysian Bar calls for immediate revocation of the
suspension of the five judges of the Supreme Court, as the
suspensions are totally inconsistent with the independence of the
judiciary and will lead to the destruction of the judiciary as an
independent branch of government,'' the council said.
   Deputy Prime Minister Abdul Ghafar Baba denied on Friday that
politicians were undermining the independence of the judiciary.
   In February, the high court ruled that Mahathir's party, the
United Malays National Organization, was illegal because it had
branches that were not registered with the authorities as required
by law. Since then, Mahathir has set up a new party called ``New
UMNO'' and has been busy recruiting old members.

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Pilot Arrives In New York Prior To Paris Trip</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: May be led.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old aviator who plans to emulate
Charles Lindbergh's flight to Paris arrived in New York with a bit
of a scare.
   Christopher Lee Marshall was piloting his Mooney 252 two-seater
toward busy La Guardia Airport on Friday evening when the plane's
electrical power _ and radio _ went dead.
   ``I thought we might get in trouble if we can't call the
tower,'' Chris said later.
   But the power outage lasted only about 10 seconds and he landed
safely.
   ``I thought it was neat to land at a big airport,'' the Oceano,
Calif., boy said.
   Chris, who is accompanied by a former Navy pilot, hopped across
the country from San Diego to Kerrville, Texas, then to St. Louis
and New York.
   Today _ if the plane's electrical problems are sorted out _ he
and his companion planned to head toward Europe. His flight plan
calls for stops in Montreal, Greenland and Iceland.
   ``I want to show all other kids across America that if I can do
this trip, they can do this trip,'' Chris said Friday at Lambert
Airport in St. Louis before taking off for New York.
   Chris, the son of a commercial pilot, first took the controls of
a plane at age 4, and began flying with an instructor at 7.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
before completing his 33{-hour, non-stop solo flight across the
Atlantic to Paris in 1927.
   Last year, Chris became the youngest flier to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-to-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris, who will be a fifth-grader this fall, said this trip
would make him the world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot. He is
accompanied by Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, 46, a retired commander
at Miramar Naval Air Station, Calif., and Vietnam War pilot.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
Chris' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But Chris
has done all of the flying, Cunningham said.
   The two flew to Texas in a borrowed plane, then traded it for a
new aircraft that was built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
   Because Cunningham is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the flight will be stretched out over
five days.
   ``He's doing good; he's a tiger,'' Cunningham said. ``He was
sick on the flight from Texas, but he flew right through it. He's
got around 270 hours of flying time in and he's very responsive.
Tell him to do something and he does it.''
   Chris' mother, Gail Marshall, founded a company that raised
money to pay for the flight.

   A pilot who crash landed in Greenland while
making a charity flight to the German battlefield where he was shot
and partially paralyzed during World War II says he will leave his
plane behind as a historical marker.
   Clark Harrison, who is paralyzed from the chest down, said
Friday he was abandoning the trip to Stolberg, West Germany. He
made the emergency landing Thursday after his single-engine,
hand-controlled Piper Cherokee ran out of gas about 40 miles north
of the U.S. Air Base at Sondrestrom, Greenland.
   The 63-year-old Decatur businessman suffered a cut and some
bruises in the crash. He said he would take a military flight to
the United States and a commercial flight home tonight.
   ``We've decided to leave it up there,'' Harrison said of his
airplane during a telephone interview from the base. ``It's going
to be a historical marker,'' he added, half in jest.
   Although the plane was not badly damaged, Col. Guy Sumter,
commander of the supply base at Sondrestrom, said it may not be
possible to remove the aircraft, which is nose down in a ditch next
to a pond.
   Harrison left DeKalb-Peachtree Airport in suburban Decatur on
July 1 but was delayed in Canada by bad weather. He finally resumed
the flight Thursday morning, three days after he had planned to
reach Greenland.
   But he ran into more harsh weather off the coast of Canada and
his 19-year-old plane was blown off course. Harrison put in an
emergency call and was shocked when it was answered by Pat Epps,
the owner of Epps Air Service at DeKalb-Peachtree Airport, who was
in Greenland on business.
   ``I felt God was answering,'' Harrison said of hearing his old
friend's voice. Epps notified the base that Harrison was lost and
almost out of fuel. On Epps' advice, Harrison climbed to 7,000 feet
so the base could locate him on radar.
   Harrison said he got his bearings when the clouds cleared as he
approached the coast of Greenland and saw an island he recognized
from his maps as being north of his plotted course. As he turned
south toward the Air Force base, the plane ran out of fuel.
   ``All I saw was mountains and rocks. I looked down and I saw a
little lake and it had a little green next to it and I said, `That
looks better than anything else,''' he said.
   ``I was pretty sure I wasn't going to be in this life when I got
on the ground,'' Harrison said. ``I realized the plane had stopped
and I was on the ground, but I couldn't remember where I was and
what I was doing there.''
   He was rescued a short time later.
   ``We knew when he got to the coast (by tracking him on radar)
and we knew where he should have been,'' Sumter said.
   Harrison's trip was planned as a fund-raising project for the
Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta and its Center for Independent
Living. Supporters pledged up to $1 for each mile covered by
Harrison, a founding director of the 13-year-old medical facility
for spinal-cord-injured patients.
   Harrison had planned to complete the 4,669-mile flight to
Aachen, West Germany, on Monday. City officials from nearby
Stolberg, site of the World War II battlefield where he was shot by
a German sniper in 1945, had planned a reception at historic
Stolberg Castle in his honor.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Drench Midwest; Heat Bakes East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain drenched parts of the Midwest today while triple-digit,
record-setting temperatures were forecast for many Eastern states
in a continuing heat wave that contributed to the death of a
Pennsylvania infant.
   Much of the central Plains reported heavy rains Friday night and
early today from thunderstorms extending across western Kansas,
much of Nebraska and northwest Iowa.
   Severe thunderstorm activity diminished early Friday evening
after touching off almost a dozen tornadoes over northeast
Colorado. No major damage was reported.
   In Indiana, Pa., a 3{-month-old girl died Thursday of
dehydration and exposure to extreme heat after her mother
apparently left her in a closed car for four hours. At Pittsburgh
International Airport, about 30 miles to the west, Friday's high of
99 broke the record of 97 set in 1876.
   West Virginia broiled under a second straight day of 100-degree
heat Friday. Triple-digit record highs were reported in Charleston
and Huntington.
   In Indiana, the South Bend high of 97 on Friday broke the record
of 96 set in 1985. Other Indiana cities sweltered under even hotter
conditions, including 102 at Evansville; 101 at Fort Wayne,
Indianapolis and Lafayette; and 100 at Terre Haute.
   In Illinois, the state issued an ozone advisory for parts of
Madison and St. Clair counties and some adjacent territory Friday
after levels of the pollutant reached up to 127 parts per billion.
A level of 120 parts per billion is considered ``unhealthful,''
said an agency spokesman.
   Ozone is created when heat and the sun react with other
pollutants such as hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides.
   In New Hampshire, state officials said brook trout and other
fish were dying as water temperatures in southern streams and
rivers rose to more than 80 degrees.
   ``They're cold-water animals and they die of heat stroke,'' said
Sgt. Ronald Evans, a Fish and Game Department district manager.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from northern Michigan across the upper Mississippi Valley, the
central and southern Plains and the central and southern Rockies to
portions of Arizona; and showers and thunderstorms over the lower
Mississippi Valley, central and southern Florida and the northern
Atlantic Coast states.
   Most of the nation was forecast to have high temperatures
between 85 and 95 degrees; record temperatures of around 100
degrees were forecast through the Tennessee and Ohio valleys,
across Indiana and Ohio and over portions of the East Coast; in the
lower 80s over northern Minnesota and across the western Great
Plains; the upper 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast; over 100
through interior valleys of California; and near 110 in the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49 at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 98 at Phoenix, Ariz.

die.''' _ Harry Calder, who survived an explosion and fire aboard

   Authorities today lifted a dusk-to-dawn
curfew that was imposed in Rangoon after thousands of students
rioted in the streets on June 21, state radio said.
   A ban on public gatherings also was lifted, the broadcast said.
   According to the government, six policemen and three civilians
were killed in the rioting. The violence erupted after university
students pressed demands, including release of colleagues detained
in earlier protests, and the government responded by closing the
schools.
   The government said that on Thursday and Friday, it freed all
784 people detained in connection with last month's riots and other
rioting in March. Of those, 288 were students, it said.
   The government also for the first time made a concession to
student demands, announcing on Friday that students expelled from
schools for the March-June demonstrations will be readmitted.

<HEAD>Government Drafts Regulations To Protect Women Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has drafted comprehensive rules
for women workers, barring them from hard physical labor and
lengthening their maternity leaves, a report said today.
   The regulations also ban discrimination against women, but only
if the work is deemed ``suitable for women workers,'' according to
the official China Daily.
   It said the regulations stipulate the kind and intensity of work
suitable to women and bar them from labor-intensive jobs such as
mining and leather-making. The criteria used in determining what
jobs were suitable was not given.
   The regulations were drafted by the ministries of labor and
public health, the All-China Trade Union and the All-China Women's
Federation, and have been approved in principle by the State
Council, the top executive body, the report said.
   The rules guarantee women the right to refuse job assignments
that could harm their health; allow one year of maternity leave
with 90 paid days, up from the current 56; and guarantee rest
periods for pregnant and menstruating women and those who have just
had abortions.
   The newspaper did not comment on the possibility that the
regulations would discourage employers from hiring women, who
according to official reports already face greater difficulty than
men in finding urban jobs.
   In the countryside most women do farmwork, although growing
numbers of male peasants are leaving the land to work in small
factories.
   The traditional belief that women are inferior to men is still
deeply ingrained in Chinese society. The Guangming Daily reported
last year that dozens of women graduates of People's University in
Beijing were rejected by the work units to which the state had
assigned them. Some units said they did not employ women.
   Now that factory managers have been given the power to fire
workers in recent years, women have been dismissed in larger
numbers than men, official reports have said.
   The China Daily said the new regulations ``contain clear
stipulations that all working units suitable for women workers
should not reject female job applicants on any pretext.''
   It did not say what sanctions, if any, would be applied against
employers found guilty of discrimination.
   Chinese law already bars women from working in mines, but
thousands are estimated to do so because mining often is the
best-paid work in rural areas.
   Despite the egalitarian ideology of Mao Tse-tung and the
equality still promised in the Constitution, women have always been
treated as second-class citizens in China.
   During Mao's rule, when government and party committees on
various levels were handpicked, one or two women would be put on
them. Now there is limited choice in elections for such committees,
and women are getting voted out.

   Two white men pleaded innocent to
charges that they helped batter down the door of a black family's
home, yelled racial slurs and hurled cinder blocks before they were
driven away at knifepoint.
   The two _ Robert J. Waterhouse Jr., 27, and Robert A.
Blanchette, 29 _ were arraigned Friday in Middlesex Superior Court
on charges of assault and battery, malicious destruction of real
property, threats, assault in a dwelling, and violation of civil
rights.
   Waterhouse and Blanchette, both of Burlington, were held on
$300,000 double surety bonds, or $30,000 cash bail.
   The two men were indicted last week in the June 19 attack on the
Burlington family, along with two other white men from Burlington
and a white woman from nearby Woburn. Both towns are suburbs of
Boston.
   ``This is considered a serious serious matter and is being
prosecuted as a priority,'' said Tom Samoluk, a spokesman for the
district attorney's office. ``The DA is making it clear that it
will not be tolerated.''
   Assistant District Attorney George Murphy said in court that
Waterhouse was the ``leader of the pack'' that battered down the
door of Sherwin Moyston's home, entered yelling racial slurs and
forced 32-year-old Moyston from the livingroom into the kitchen.
   ``They came in yelling, `We want you, nigger! We want a piece of
you, nigger!''' Murphy told Middlesex Superior Court Judge Hiller
Zobel.
   Moyston grabbed a knife in the kitchen and drove the attackers
back out the front door, where he was joined by a relative, Marvin
McNichols.
   Waterhouse struck McNichols in the mouth, knocking him
unconscious and opening a wound that took 18 stitches to close,
Murphy said.
   The five attackers left the property after hurling cinder blocks
at the house and breaking windows, authorities said.
   ``When they were leaving, they said, `We're going to take care
of you, niggers, we're going to come back,''' Murphy said.
   The prosecutor had asked Zobel to hold Waterhouse on $500,000
double surety and Blanchette on $200,000.
   During the hearing, Murphy said he requested a higher bail for
Waterhouse because of the suspect's record of violent behavior and
because Waterhouse is currently the target of a grand jury probe
into the stabbing death of a black man whose body was found in
Woburn last month. He refused to elaborate after the hearing.
   The co-defendants, Barbara J. Lindsay and John C. Soda, both 18,
and Mark Gilmartin, 20, are scheduled to be arraigned July 15.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
said today that the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner in the
Persian Gulf was dramatic proof of what an American policy of
building up tensions can lead to.
   It was the highest-level official Soviet comment to date on
Sunday's disaster, in which the cruiser USS Vincennes shot down an
Iran Air Airbus.
   The United States said he crew mistook the plane for an F-14
fighter. Iran said all 290 people aboard were killed.
   Shevardnadze met in Moscow with U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock at
Matlock's request to discuss various regional issues, the Tass news
agency said. It provided a brief report on the meeting.
   Commenting on the airliner's destruction, Shevardnadze said,
``This was not an accident, but dramatic evidence showing what a
policy from positions of strength and of building up tensions can
lead to.''
   Shevaradnadze also repeated the Kremlin's demand that all
foreign warships withdraw from the Persian Gulf. The Soviets
contend such a concentration of military might increases the danger
of conflict.
   Since the airliner's destruction, Soviet officials have issued
relatively mild criticism of the United States, apparently because
of reluctance to cause any chill in improved superpower relations.
State-run media have carried much tougher remarks, including
accusations that the U.S. Navy warship committed ``deliberate mass
murder in cold blood.''
   Shevardnadze, a member of the 13-man ruling Politburo, was the
highest-level Kremlin official to comment publicly on the Iranian
airliner disaster.
   Tass said the Soviet foreign minister and Matlock also discussed
the Nicaraguan conflict and that Shevardnadze criticized ``the
anti-Nicaraguan policy of the U.S.''
   Shevardnadze said the Soviets firmly intend to keep providing
aid to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, which is fighting
U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   He said Nicaragua's government ``is fighting for the
independence and sovereignty of its country, for the right of its
people to have a free choice,'' Tass reported.

   Five people, including three Britons, died
in raging forest fires on the western resort islands of Cephalonia
and Corfu, police said today.
   The officials said Irene Evans, a 32-year-old mother of three,
died from burns on Friday while being airlifted by helicopter to a
hospital in the town of Argostoli in Cephalonia.
   Two of Evans' daughters, Jenny, 10, and Maria, 3, also died in
the fire that broke out early Friday near the village of Lakithra
on the Ionian island.
   The officials, who declined to be identified in accordance with
Greek practice, said 14-year-old Angela Evans survived the flames
but was listed in critical condition in an Athens hospital.
   They said five other Greeks were also hospitalized with burns.
   A police spokesman on Cephalonia said Evans, of Greek origin,
had been vacationing on the island without her husband, Tom. He
said the Evans family lived in London.
   The spokesman said two hotels on the island were evacuated and
some tourists spent the night on a beach.
   A Greek woman, Eleni Konstantatou, 82, also died in the fire on
Cephalonia, according to the officials.
   The officials said George Efthimiades, 60, died while battling
the flames with teams of firefighters on Corfu.
   High winds gusting up to 25 miles were hampering firefighters'
efforts to put out the blazes on both resort islands, forestry
officials said.
   Another fire was raging out of control through the forests of
Mount Olympus, home of the legendary Greek gods in northern Greece,
Alekos Voutsaras, a forestry official at the agriculture ministry
said.
   ``We've got hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and nine
firefighting planes battling all three blazes but the strong winds
are really hampering us,'' Voutsaras told The Associated Press.
   The forestry official said it still wasn't clear how any of the
three fires started or how much damage they had caused.
   The blazes on both islands broke out on the seventh day of a
heat wave that has sent temperatures soaring past 104 degrees
Fahrenheit range and has left more than 30 dead.
   More than 3,000 people have been admitted to hospitals because
of the blistering temperatures.

   Oil troubleshooter ``Red'' Adair
boarded the Piper Alpha oil platform today to try to stop fires
still raging on the twisted wreckage, where 166 people died in the
world's worst oilfield disaster.
   Adair was lowered by crane onto the North Sea rig from the
nearby support vessel Tharos in a personnel basket, said Occidental
Petroleum, the rig's American owner.
   Occidental Petroleum hired the 73-year-old Texan to make the
platform safe, seal gas leaks and determine whether he can save the
oil wells to which the rig is connected. Adair, of Houston, Texas,
has gained fame for capping out-of-control oil wells.
   Occidental says it believes a gas leak caused an explosion last
Wednesday night that turned the 34,000-ton rig into a fireball.
   Sixty-four workers escaped and survived. Eighteen remained in
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, one in serious condition and the rest
stable, the hospital said today.
   Adair and two assistants flew to the disaster site, 120 miles
off Scotland's east coast, on Friday. They have been using the
Tharos, a semi-submersible support vessel that Adair helped design,
as a temporary base.
   On Friday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Occidental
Petroleum chairman Armand Hammer agreed that the explosion shows
major design changes are needed on offshore oil platforms.
   Hammer, Mrs. Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana met
some of the survivors and families of the dead on Friday. The royal
couple brought skin graft equipment from London to treat survivors'
burns.
   Hammer said Occidental was donating $1.7 million to a trust fund
for the injured and the bereaved. The government matched the figure
and the European Economic Community added $952,000.
   The 90-year-old oil magnate told a news conference after meeting
with Mrs. Thatcher in this east Scottish port city Friday night:
   ``Mrs. Thatcher thinks, and we think, that when we complete our
inquiry and the government completes theirs, it may very well be
that the living quarters for the men may have to be removed from
the precarious position they are in.''
   Survivor Harry Calder, 35, said 100 men died screaming for help,
trapped in the living quarters after they survived the initial
explosion.
   The quarters were directly above the rig's gas compression
chamber, where Occidental officials say they think a gas leak
caused the blast.
   Hammer said living quarters and production facilities probably
would remain on the same platform, but would be separated instead
of adjacent as at present.
   In a statement released in London, Occidental confirmed British
news reports that the rig's gas compression chamber had previous
problems, including a gas leak and a fire.
   But it said the problems were minor, they were corrected and
they had no bearing on Wednesday's disaster.
   Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife, Princess Diana, were
driven to the emergency entrance of the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary
and spoke briefly with doctors before going to visit the injured.
   Charles brought with him skin graft equipment for the
infirmary's burn unit to replace a machine that was not working
properly.
   ``It was much needed,'' said Oliver Fenton, a plastic surgeon.
``We were having to shuttle the only one working effectively round
the operating theaters.''
   Flags flew at half-staff in Aberdeen, capital of Britain's North
Sea oil industry, when Mrs. Thatcher arrived at the Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary.
   ``I'm amazed at how well they are in themselves,'' she said.
``Even though they have burns and internal burns, their morale is
very high. These are people with great inner strength and great
capacity to tackle the disaster.''
   Hammer said the six Occidental employees who survived and the
families of 31 who died would receive compensation worth about
$170,000 each, plus lifetime pensions, and Occidental will fix
compensation later for the employees of 25 contractors.
   About 120 workers on British Petroleum's West Sole gas platform
in the North Sea resigned Friday, saying they were concerned about
safety. They said access from the living quarters to evacuation
positions on one platform was difficult.
   But British Petroleum said in a statement: ``We are regularly
inspected and have to meet the regulations. If we did not come up
to standard we would not be able to continue producing.''

   Libraries are considered mines of
information but a student digging for knowledge got more than she
expected when she uncovered 12 uncut diamonds tucked inside an
86-year-old diary.
   Gerda Ray, a doctoral student at the University of California at
Berkeley, was doing research work at Yale University's Sterling
Memorial Library last month when she found the gems wrapped in old
cigarette papers inside a letter. The letter was tucked into a 1902
diary of author Katherine Mayo.
   ``Though there have been lots of discoveries here, they have
always been intellectual ones,'' said Mary LaFogg, an archivist at
the library.
   Researchers have used the Mayo collection for almost 30 years,
said LaFogg, but no one noticed the diamonds before.
   ``I can't think of anything quite as exciting,'' LaFogg said,
adding that there has never been a similar discovery at the library.
   Peabody Museum mineralogist Eleanor Faller said the diamonds are
not valuable but they match stones found during the early 1900s in
British Guiana, now Guyana, in South America.
   The stones were sent to Mayo, who died in 1940, by a friend
living in British Guiana.
   The diamonds will be housed in the Peabody museum.

   People who complain about their daily commute
might find solace in the long, long drive of advertising salesman
Rod Conklin, named in a promotional contest as the nation's No. 1
commuter.
   Conklin, 34, drives each morning from his home in Darien, Conn.,
to his office in Boston, then back home again at night. His commute
through three states takes seven hours; it's 408 miles round trip.
   Sometimes, if he stops to see a client, it takes longer.
   ``We are all very adaptable creatures,'' Conklin said after
winning a car stereo and other prizes Friday in a nationwide
commuter contest sponsored by Kraco Enterprises, a Southern
California car stereo company.
   ``It's funny how you get into a rhythm of something and make the
best of it.''
   Conklin's rhythm begins when he awakens at 4:30 a.m. He leaves
home at 5:30 a.m. and gets to work at about 9 a.m. He usually
leaves at 5 p.m. and arrives home after 8 p.m.
   He passes the time by listening to music and language-course
tapes.
   ``I really don't see much of my wife during the week,'' he said.
   The commute was the result of a job transfer 1{ years ago to
Boston from New York City, which is within conventional commuting
distance of Darien, a suburban community in southwest Connecticut.
   He expects to continue the commute for another 1{ years.
   ``Then I'll move to the Boston area and get this thing under
control,'' he said.

Outraged</HEAD>

Cardenas' comments; no pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   An opposition candidate in Mexico's
presidential elections said today the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party was seeking to steal victory with its demand
for a recount of votes in the capital.
   National Democratic Front candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas told a
news conference that the governing party had petitioned the Federal
Elections Commission to nullify voting in the Federal District
because thousands of voters had used differing party symbols to
cast ballots for Cardenas.
   Cardenas is listed on the ballots as the presidential candidate
of three different parties. Those parties subsequently merged as
the National Democratic Front to back his candidacy.
   The Commission had rejected a Democratic Front request before
the election that ballots be reprinted to list Cardenas only once.
   The governing party's recount request is ``absurd,'' Cardenas
said. ``Our information shows we have won in nearly all, if not
all, 40 districts of the Federal District.
   ``I call upon the president of the Republic (and governing
party) candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari to comply with their
word and their commitment to preserve the legality of this
electoral process,'' he said.
   Early and partial returns released by the Federal Electoral
Commission on Friday showed Salinas with 47.4 percent of the 4.5
million votes tabulated. The commission said Cardenas had 26.7
percent of the vote and Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative
National Action Party had 20.7 percent.
   Final results for the presidential election and for the 64-seat
Senate and 500-seat Congress are to be released Sunday.
   The governing party has won every presidential election since it
was created in 1929, but this year's presidential and congressional
balloting was expected to be the closest in years.
   The Commission did not say how many of Mexico's 38 million
registered voters actually cast ballots on Wednesday.
   The governing party's chairman, Jorge de la Vega Dominguez,
earlier had proclaimed victory in at least 27 of Mexico's 31 states
and said opposition accusations of fraud were meant to confuse the
electorate.
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a Front Senate candidate and former
chairman of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, charged that the
governing party was printing extra ballots to replace those it was
seeking to annul. The new ballots would be marked with
Institutional Revolutionary Party votes, he said.
   ``Just Friday morning everyone in the government knew we had
won'' the Mexico City race, Munoz Ledo said. ``Now they are
de-legitimizing everything.''
   Munoz Ledo also indicated the Front was leading in the states of
Michoacan, Mexico, Morelos and Guerrero.
   On Friday, Salinas appeared to be preparing supporters for the
party's first federal losses since it was founded in 1929.
   ``The results so far ratify this circumstance of plurality ...
and a new political reality in Mexico,'' Salinas said.
   Cardenas said today the election commission had promised not to
release any returns until the vote count was completed and charged
the figures included results from voting stations where the
Institutional Revolutionary Party said it won 100 percent of the
votes or did not permit opposition poll-watchers to be present.
   ``The Interior Secretary broke the commitments he gave'' not to
publish incomplete results and ``released these data without
consulting the various parties,'' Cardenas said.
   Institutional Revolutionary Party officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity, had said Friday the governing party may
have to concede that Cardenas won in Michoacan, Morelos and the
capital. They said Cardenas might also win in the state of Mexico,
which abuts the federal district on three sides.
   Salinas said the opposition's presence will be most felt in the
Chamber of Deputies, where a two-thirds majority is necessary to
pass legislation. The chamber traditionally has been little more
than a rubber stamp for the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   ``There we're going to see intensely this new reality,'' Salinas
said.
   Earlier Friday, Clouthier accused the government of delaying an
election announcement ``to see how to disguise the figures.'' He
called a rally for today in Mexico City's central square, where his
party planned to release its own vote count.
   Hundreds of National Action Party supporters celebrated Friday
in Ciudad Juarez to mark what they believed was a victory there. A
party motorcade crisscrossed the city in triumph, but all was quiet
at the city's Institutional Revolutionary Party offices.
   The Assembly for Effective Suffrage, a watchdog group, said it
discovered 1,100 cases of irregularities ranging from
ballot-stuffing and tampering with voter registration rolls.
   Alfonso Bravo, president of Justice and Peace, one of the
organizations comprising the assembly, said the group had detected
voting irregularities in 20 percent of the approximately 28,000
voting booths it had monitored.

<TEXT>
   The governors of Iowa and Kentucky declared drought emergencies
in their states while unhealthy air warnings were issued in the
East because of pollution trapped by stiffling heat.
   The Army Corps of Engineers received approval Friday to spend
$3.4 million to try to slow the advance of salt water up the
Mississippi River and clear salt-tainted drinking water, while a
Corps official in Memphis, Tenn., said a plan of diverting Great
Lakes water to the Mississippi might not be much help.
   Dairy farmers in Ohio and Wisconsin were selling off herds at
record clips. Farmers in Oregon and United Parcel Service made
plans to airlift hay to stricken farmers in Kentucky.
   Even law enforcements officers had their problems with Alabama's
billion- dollar marijuana crop _ they're having trouble finding it
because the stunted plants are difficult to spot from the air.
   And the heat rolled on.
   The national weather service reoported that more than two dozen
high temperature records were broken or tied Friday. Temperatures
reaching 100 degrees were common over the Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys and lower Michigan.
   Triple-digit, record-setting temperatures were forecast today
for many Eastern states.
   Much of the central Plains reported heavy rains Friday night and
early today from thunderstorms extending across western Kansas,
much of Nebraska and northwest Iowa.
   The White House said President Reagan will go to the Midwest on
Thursday to talk to farmers, and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, who
declared the entire state a disaster area Friday, said he will meet
next week with Reagan and push for drought-relief measures.
   A group of U.S. senators Friday asked the president to send more
water from the Great Lakes into the record-low Mississippi River, a
plan Canadian Justice Minister Ray Hnatyshyn said that country
would oppose.
   But John Elmore, chief of operations for the Army Engineers,
said while diverting water from the Great Lakes could raise the
Mississippi at Memphis by 4 to 6 inches, towboats still would be
hindered by barge groundings and dredgings.
   The air quality in parts of New Jersey reached ``unhealthful
levels'' Friday afternoon because of ozone, the state Department of
Environmental Protection said. People with heart or respiratory
problems were advised to limit outdoor activity. The problem was
expected to continue through the weekend.
   In metropolitan areas of Ohio and three areas of Illinois
similar warnings were issued Friday as well as in five major urban
areas of Kentucky.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson declared a state of emergency in Kentucky
Friday and put into motion the apparatus that could allow the state
to take over water distribution systems.
   Under one measure, Kentucky is planning to buy more than 10,000
tons of hay in Oregon so farmers with dried-up pastures can feed
their livestock. A 100-car train loaded with several hundred tons
of hay will leave Oregon within a month, and United Parcel Service
agreed to fly 300 tons to Louisville next week free, said Kentucky
Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch'' Burnette.
   The hay will be sold to farmers for $80 to $90 a ton. Burnette
said brokers seeking to take advantage of the drought have quoted
him prices as high as $240 a ton.
   In northeastern Ohio, hay has been selling at auction for $350 a
ton, said auction manager John Sprunger, adding ``That's like
buying gold.''
   Also in Ohio, residents of seven counties announced they had
raised $70,000 of the $125,000 needed to bring Fresno, Calif.-based
Atmospherics, Inc., to the area to seed the clouds with chemicals
in hopes of increasing rainfall.
   Seeding could begin as early as next week, said Kevin Hooper, a
Ohio Farm Bureau official.
   In Wisconsin, the shortage of livestock feed is forcing dairy
farmers to cull their herds, a trend that could raise milk prices.
   If the number of cows in the state decreases 25 percent as some
observers predict, the milk shortage by autumn could mean an
increase of 8 to 10 cents a gallon at the supermarket, said Truman
F. Graf, University of Wisconsin farm economics professor.
   In Ohio, a 16-hour auction in Wayne County Thursday and Friday,
1,274 head of cattle and calves were put on the block, double what
the auction usually handles, said Sprunger.

   Divers retrieved 13 more bodies today
from a train that derailed on a bridge and tumbled into a lake,
raising the death toll to 103, government and navy officials said.
   The divers used gas torches to cut open a last passenger car
that could not be searched immediately after the accident on
Friday. There had been fears that as many as 50 passengers were
trapped in the car when it plunged into the water.
   But Vice Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas, chief of the Southern
Naval Command, said he believed most victims had been found.
   ``We have searched the entire lot,'' he said after returning
from the accident scene. ``It is most unlikely that we will find
any more bodies, though there may be odd ones stuck somewhere.''
   However, teams of navy divers kept looking for bodies in the
20-to 30-foot water as far as 400 yards from the sunken wreckage.
   Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia today ordered a formal
inquiry into the derailment.
   He told a news conference after visiting the crash site that
families of victims would be compensated, the United News of India
reported.
   Nine cars of the 14-car Island Express derailed Friday on a
bridge over Lake Asthamudi near the town of Quilon in Kerala state,
about 1,200 miles south of New Delhi.
   Abdul Latif, additional district magistrate in Quilon, said most
victims died of drowning.
   At least 167 people remained hospitalized today, he said.
Officials had said after the train wrecked that 500 people were
injured, but most of the injured were treated for minor injuries
and released.
   Efforts to recover the bodies continued into the night under
floodlights, but had to be called off at 10 p.m. because of rain
and poor visibility. The search resumed this morning.
   Six of the brick-red cars were partly or fully submerged in the
water, and three hung from the bridge, which is about 15 feet above
the lake. The engine and the following luggage car crossed the
bridge safely, and the last four cars did not go off the trestle.
   Fishermen in long, narrow boats were the first to reach the
scene, and the rescue official said they saved more than 200 people
from drowning.
   The rescue official said 36 divers from the Naval Base at
Cochin, 70 miles northwest of the accident site, continued the
rescue effort.
   The railway administration still does not know how many people
were aboard the train bound from Bangalore in neighboring Karnataka
state to Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala and about 30 miles south
of Quilon.
   Government television and Indian news agencies reported that a
cave-in on the 540-foot bridge caused the derailment, but Railways
Ministry officials said the cause had yet to be determined.
   Matthew John, a railway safety official, said two spans of the
bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as
the train cars plunged into the water.
   Witnesses told Indian news agencies that the train engineer
jammed on the brakes just before the derailment. But Subramaniam
said, ``It wouldn't cause a disaster of this magnitude.''
   The Indian railway system, second largest in the world and
carrying 9 million passengers daily, has been plagued with
accidents.
   According to a report to Parliament in February, 227 people were
killed in 613 train accidents during 1987.
   The world's worst train accident occurred in India, according to
the Guinness Book of World Records. More than 800 people were
killed when a train plunged into a flood-swollen river in the
eastern state of Bihar in June 1981, Guinness says.

   The American Bar Association has named 19
winners, including The Associated Press, in its Silver Gavel Awards
competition for increasing public awareness of the American system
of law and justice.
   The AP award was in the ``wire services-news syndicates''
category, for the national series called ``Guardians of the
Elderly: An Ailing System.'' The AP series examined the
guardianship system that affects the lives of up to 400,000 elderly
Americans deemed mentally incompetent.
   The awards, decided by an 18-member judges' committee and
announced Friday, are presented for ``outstanding public service in
increasing public understanding of the American legal system.'' The
31st annual competition drew 500 entries from 298 media
organizations that produced or presented their entries in 1987, the
ABA said.
   ABA President Robert MacCrate will present the gavels at an
awards luncheon Aug. 8 during the ABA's annual meeting in Toronto.
   Among winners in the newspaper category were:
   _ The Advocate, of Stamford, Conn., for a special section called
``The Constitution'' which included writings of local readers as
well as constitutional scholars;
   _ The Bucks County Courier Times, of Levittown, Pa., for
``District Justices,'' a series disclosing politicial activities of
elected community magistrates;
   _ The Courier Journal, of Louisville, Ky., for ``Great
Constitutional Cases from Kentucky;''
   _ The Dallas Times Herald of Dallas for ``The Immigration
Scramble: Will it Work?''
   _ The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, for ``The Constitution: Then and
Now,'' which illustrated constitutional issues with old and current
stories.
   In the television category, winners include:
   _ ABC News for ``The Blessings of Liberty,'' a program tracing
constitutional development through use of narrative, music, movies
and drama;
   _ Cable News Network for selected segments of its series ``A
More Perfect Union,'' designed to teach the public about the
constitution;
   _ Columbia University Seminars on Media and Society for a
televised series called ``The Presidency and the Constitution;''
   _ WCBS-TV in New York for ``Out of the Shadows,'' about
immigration laws and their enforcement;
   _ WNEV-TV of Boston for ``Power of Silence,'' about the Fifth
Amendment and its use in forums including the Iran-Contra hearings;
   _ WOKR-TV, of Rochester, N.Y., for ``Special Report on the Bill
of Rights;''
   _ KRMA-TV of Denver for ``First Degree Murder Trial,'' which
showed most of a real trial;
   _ Maryland Public Television of Owings Mills, Md., for ``The
Rise and Fall of Prohibition.''
   In the radio category, the only winner was National Public Radio
of Washington for ``Children as Witnesses in Court,'' which
examined how testimony is elicited from children, and how to
determine its credibility.
   Publishers of three books will also get awards, including:
   _ The University of California Press in Berkeley, for ``American
Broadcasting and the First Amendment,'' a book by Lucas Powe;
   _ Viking Penguin, Inc. of New York, for ``Fighting Faiths,'' by
Richard Polenberg, dealing with immigrants;
   _ West Publishing Co. of St. Paul, Minn., for ``The Enduring
Constitution,'' by Jethro Lieberman.
   The New York Times was the winner in the newspaper magazine
supplement section for its article called ``The Great Voyage,''
tracing the Constitution's role in guiding the growth of the
country.
   The Associated Press project on guardians was based on a
yearlong examination of more than 2,200 probate court files around
the country by a team of 67 reporters and editors.
   The six-day national series, written by reporters Fred Bayles
and Scott McCartney, examined the guardianship system, a poorly
regulated network aimed at caring for the 300,000 to 400,000
elderly Americans deemed mentally incompetent to handle their own
affairs, but found too often to provide opportunities for abuse and
fraud.
   Each state's system was described in separate series that moved
on AP state wires. All told, more than 300 stories were transmitted.

   The pilot of the Iranian jetliner the U.S.
Navy shot down last weekend had a 5-year-old daughter who is an
American citizen, and family members say explaining the way her
father died won't be easy.
   ``She was proud to be an American,'' said Nahy Sadeghi, the
sister of pilot Mohsen Rezaian's wife. The child was born in
Oklahoma while Mrs. Rezaian was visiting her sister.
   ``She always said to the other children, `I'm the American.' How
is she (the mother) going to tell her that her father was shot down
by Americans when she's an American?'' Mrs. Sadeghi said Friday.
The Rezaians had two other children.
   Mrs. Sagedhi and her husband, Kamran, said the pilot considered
the United States his second home.
   ``He liked the United States very much,'' Mrs. Sadeghi said.
   ``He had a good time here,'' added Kamran Sadeghi, who said
Rezaian was trained in Texas by Boeing Co.
   The Sadeghis said because of the increased U.S. presence in the
Persian Gulf, they knew their brother-in-law's job had become more
dangerous.
   Even so, said Mrs. Sadeghi, she considered his job routine. She
was a stewardess in Iran from 1968 to 1973. ``I'm familiar with the
flights. They are all so crowded.''
   Kamran Sadeghi came to the United States in 1971 to attend the
University of Oklahoma and now works for the school as a computer
programmer.
   The couple said they aren't sure who to blame for the incident
Sunday, in which the USS Vincennes shot down the Airbus A300, which
carried 290 people.
   ``All Iranians do not represent the Iranian government,'' Mrs.
Sadeghi said. ``Same with the Americans and the American
government. They are following their own policies. I blame the
situation. It's the war that made the American Navy to be there.''
   Mrs. Sadeghi said her sister has been living in West Germany for
10 months because of the fighting between Iran and Iraq.
   The Sadeghis had a strong reaction to early reports that the
downed flight was a ``suicide mission,'' with orders to crash into
the Vincennes.
   ``No, no. If you had known him, if you could talk to him once,
you would never imagine that,'' Mrs. Sadeghi said. ``It's not even
possible. He was a very good human being. He valued people. He
valued people's lives.
   ``He loved his family, he loved his kids,'' Mrs. Sadeghi said.
``He was very responsible and would never do anything to jeopardize
his own life.''
   Now, Mrs. Sadeghi said, her concerns lie with her sister, and
how she ``can survive this with her children.'' She said the
children had not been told yet how their father died.
   The couple said that if the United States offers to provide
financial help, the payment should go directly to the families.
   ``If the United States pays them money, I don't want them to pay
the government of Iran,'' Sadeghi said. ``If they do, they should
pay the victims directly. Iran needs money. Without it, maybe it
would stop the war.''

   Three Maryland prison escapees face
first-degree murder charges in the slaying of a police officer who
was shot to death after he stopped the vehicle they were riding in.
   Officer Ernest Ponce De Leon, 40, was the first full-time
officer killed in the police department's 143-year history. Four
people in the car, including the escapees, were wounded in a gun
battle Friday with another officer who came to the scene to assist
Ponce De Leon.
   Ponce De Leon died minutes after he was shot twice in the chest,
said police spokesman Phil Kiracofe. A former reserve officer and
probation official, Ponce De Leon became a full-time officer in
1986.
   The four injured people were arrested after the shooting behind
a laundry several miles southwest of downtown.
   Police say Clarence J. Jones, 33, went to the trunk of the
vehicle supposedly to retrieve identification but pulled a pistol
and opened fire, said Kiracofe.
   The three escapees were wounded by Officer Greg Armstrong, a
member of the department for less than a year. The fourth person in
the car, a Jacksonville woman, was probably hit by gunfire from one
of the escapees, Kiracfe said.
   Armstrong ``emptied his weapon at least once and had to reload
under an awful lot of pressure. He fired a lot of rounds,'' said
Kiracofe. Armstrong was armed with a .357-caliber Magnum service
revolver.
   The escapees were identified as Jones, who was serving 25 years
for robbery with a deadly weapon and attempted robbery; Henry
Goins, 26, who was serving 12 years for rape, kidnapping and
robbery with a deadly weapon; and Irvin Griffin, 28, who was
serving 45 years for assault with intent to murder.
   Jones was treated for a gunshot to the face and turned over to
police for questioning, said Kiracofe. Goins was in critical
condition with a gunshot wound to the head, said Ron Brafford,
spokesman for Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center. Griffin
was listed in stable condition with a gunshot to the thigh at
Tallahassee Memorial.
   They were charged with first-degreee murder Friday night, and
under the state's felony murder rule could be given a death
sentence if convicted.
   The fourth occupant, Beverly Lee Harris, 39, a longtime
acquaintance of Griffin, was reported in stable condition at
Tallahassee Community Hospital by Ronald Rudderman, assistant
hospital administrator.
   The whereabouts of the fourth Maryland escapee, Douglas
Edgerton, 21, who was serving a 20-year sentence for second-degree
murder, were unknown.
   The four escaped June 25 by overpowering a guard at the Maryland
House of Correction.
   In Tallahassee, it was the department's first death of an
officer in the line of duty since 1982 when a reserve motorcycle
officer was killed in an accident while escorting astronaut John
Young. Until then, no Tallahassee officer had been killed in the
line of duty, said Kiracofe.

<TEXT>
   A former Iranian Air Force pilot was
convicted early today in the shooting death of a doctor, also a
native of Iran, in what the family of the dead man called a
political assassination.
   The Berkeley County Circuit Court jury recommended mercy at the
sentencing of Mozaffer Shivaee, 30, of Escondido, Calif.
   Shivaee was convicted in the slaying of Dr. Morteza Fard, 50.
Fard was killed at a city park in this eastern West Virginia city
on July 3, 1987.
   Shivaee could be sentenced to life in prison. No sentencing date
has been set, pending the filing of post-verdict motions, officials
said.
   Psychologist Leroy Stone, testifying for the defense, said
Shivaee may have had ``delusions'' of an affair between his wife
and the physician. Stone said he was unable to find any evidence
that an affair actually took place.
   Shivaee worked for Fard in his Tehran clinic from 1978 to 1982.
Fard also lived in California for a time after leaving Iran in 1982.
   After the shooting, Fard family members said the two men had
been on opposite political sides in Iran and they contended that
the shooting was a political assassination.
   When arrested minutes after the shooting, carrying a .38-caliber
handgun, Shivaee told the arresting officer that he was on ``a
mission.''
   The day of the shooting, a Washington television said it
received a telephone call indicating that the doctor was
assassinated because of his political views.
   Fard was a staff physician at City Hospital in Martinsburg and
was an expert on nerve and muscle therapy.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Calls For Sept. 1 Cease-Fire in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. official today called for a
Sept. 1 cease-fire in Afghanistan and establishment of an interim
Afghan government that would exclude guerrillas or officials under
Marxist President Najib.
   U.N. envoy Diego Cordovez, making his comments a a news
conference after returning from the Afghan capital of Kabul, said
the proposed government would consist of ``recognized independent
and impartial'' Afghans.
   Cordovez said the new government would be effective Sept. 1,
when a cease-fire would go into effect, and that it would convene a
grand council of leaders no later than March 1.
   The grand council is a traditional Afghan decision-making body
whose leaders were chosen according to the country's tribal
structure.
   Cordovez said he believes such a council would be able to
establish a government with broad-based support, while Najib's
national reconciliation plan and attempts by supporters of the
guerrillas to generate mass support have failed.
   The guerrillas did not immediately comment on Cordovez' peace
plan, but a spokesman for a moderate guerrilla group opposed any
negotiations with the communist Afghan government.
   ``We will not have anything to do with communists, any kind of
communists,'' said Azim Nasser-Zia, of the National Islamic Front
of Afghanistan.
   He also called for a ``cooling-off'' period in the fighting
before Sept. 1, during which the interim government would be
chosen. Afghan guerrilla leaders, backed by China, Pakistan and the
United States, have insisted that they will continue to fight until
Soviet troops are out of Afghanistan and the Kabul government is
toppled.
   ``I doubt whether there could be a cooling-off period,'' said
Ikram Gran, spokesman for the seven-party Afghan Alliance, which
has its headquarters in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar.
   Gran said, however, that he and Nasser-Zia both supported the
selection of the ``independent and impartial'' representatives.
They suggested the new leaders could be chosen among former Cabinet
ministers and officials now living in exile.
   Cordovez returned to Islamabad Friday from Kabul, where he met
with Najib, other Afghan leaders and Soviet Gen. Valentin Verenikov.
   Cordovez negotiated the April 14 Geneva accords which provide
for the phased withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   The Kremlin sent troops and tanks into Afghanistan in December
1979 to back the Communist government. In the April pact, the
Soviets agreed to pull out the more than 100,000 troops they
deployed.
   Half of the troops are to be out of the country by Aug. 15 and
the remainder by Feb. 15.
   Cordovez said 32,000 Soviet troops have already left
Afghanistan. He said Soviet military representatives assured him
the withdrawal was proceeding as planned.

<TEXT>
   Faced with its toughest opposition in years,
the machine that runs Mexico is torn between adapting to a changing
political climate or clinging to a formula that has kept it in
power for six decades.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party has been beset by
infighting between old-guard operatives who want to keep the system
intact and a new breed led by presidential candidate Carlos Salinas
de Gortari, who want to modernize the party machine.
   The political system now is made up of a huge network of
patronage and pork-barrel projects that can create or eliminate
jobs, and which provide a raft of favors to loyal party members.
Corruption has been a key ingredient in its succes.
   Under the system, the outgoing president usually names his
successor, subject to approval by the party. Other candidates are
chosen in closed conventions, and the party machinery makes sure
they get elected.
   The system has kept the party in power under various names since
it was formed in 1929. Its presidential candidate always has won
with at least 70 percent of the vote.
   It has held the governors' offices in all of Mexico's 31 states
and lost only one Senate race, to a coalition that included the
party. In the Chamber of Deputies, it has tolerated a weak
opposition.
   Opponents or opposition groups who became to powerful often were
bought off with plush jobs, or gradually swallowed by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   ``For years it worked slowly, like an amoeba, assimilating and
incorporating opposition groups,'' one old PRI hand, who spoke on
condition he not be identified, said recently.
   As long as Mexico remained even relatively prosperous, it could
finance the party's system and the party kept Mexico politically
stable and generally content.
   The bubble burst in 1982, when prices of oil _ Mexico's
principal export _ plunged, bringing on one of the severest
economic crises in half a century.
   Jobs suddenly were not plentiful. Real income plunged by at
least 40 percent.
   One of the engineers of the austerity program was Salinas di
Gortari, 40, a Harvard-educated economist who served for five years
as President Miguel de la Madrid's budget and planning secretary.
   The crisis also brought widespread discontent, and this
strengthened the parties both on the right and the left of the
governing party. The tensions between the old guard and the
technocrats became more visible after Salinas' nomination for
president last year.
   De la Madrid, a Harvard educated technocrat himself, ignored
objections from powerful groups and selected Salinas as his
successor.
   Many favored Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett, and others
backed then-Energy and Mines Secretary Alfredo Del Mazo.
   Fidel Velazquez, 88, general secretary of the party's power
Mexican Labor Federation and a member of the old guard, made no
bones of his displeasure when Salinas de Gortari was proclaimed by
the party as its presidential candidate.
   Preliminary election figures from the Federal Electoral
Commission show the party won the presidency by its slimmest margin
yet.
   Early returns indicate Salinas de Gortari won an estimated 47.4
percent, while Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist National
Democratic Front had 26.7 percent and Manuel J. Clouthier of the
conservative National Action Party had 20.7 percent.
   Even before Wednesday's elections, Salinas said in his speeches
the party should be modernized to meet the growing challenge of the
opposition.
   The left's apparent success in the elections was spurred by
Cardenas, who broke with the governing party last year after his
push for reforms was rebuffed.
   Salinas' aides now speak of a ``multi-party system'' for Mexico,
in which the Institutional Revolutionary Party would occupy an
expandable center.
   Salinas campaigned for democratic reforms, less state
intervention in the economy and the need for ``clean elections.''
   Aides said throughout the campaign that he was prepared to
sacrifice ideology to practicality in a bid not just to get to Los
Pinos, the presidential residence, but to get there with some of
his party's credibility intact.
   The major question for him in his first months of office will be
how much resistance the ``old guard'' puts up to his proposed
changes.

   Communist rebels on Saturday blamed
President Corazon Aquino for the upsurge in attacks by right-wing
deaths squads on leftists and human rights activists, and they
pledged reprisals.
   Government troops killed at least 15 rebels in separate clashes
on the main island of Luzon and on southern Mindanao island, the
military said.
   ``The Aquino government and its U.S. backers cannot escape their
full responsibility for the crimes committed by forces of state
terrorism against the people,'' the National Democratic Front said
in a statement sent to news agencies.
   ``At the same time, unofficial death squads have killed a
mounting number of prominent individuals who had courageously made
common cause with their suffering countrymen.'' it said.
   The Front, the political wing of the outlawed Communist Party of
the Philippines, said it is futile for victims of right-wing
extremists to expect justice from Mrs. Aquino's government. It
urged them to support the 19-year-old communist insurgency instead.
   On July 2, gunmen believed to be right-wing extremists
assassinated human rights lawyer Emmanuel Mendoza in Manila.
Mendoza was the third human rights lawyer to be killed in two weeks
in the Philippines.
   On June 30, Nemesio Prudente, a leftist university president,
was seriously wounded in an ambush. The ambush, the second on
Prudente in seven months, left three of his security aides dead and
five others wounded.
   Police have arrested five Manila policemen and an anti-communist
vigilante in connection with Prudente's second attack.
   ``By its declared total war policy and refusal to heed popular
clamor against state-sponsored terrorism, the U.S.-Aquino regime is
called to account for these crimes,'' the Front said.
   The rebels pledged ``that revolutionary justice will be done _
fascist criminals will be punished, the people will be defended _
firmly and judiciously.''
   In Quezon province, government troops backed by artillery fire
and four helicopter gunships have killed at least 10 communist
rebels since Friday in a bid to rescue five officers held captive
by the guerrillas, Col. Hernani Figueroa said Saturday.
   Figueroa, spokesman for the Southern Luzon Command, said the
clash occured on the outskirts of Tayabas town in Quezon province,
about 55 miles south of Manila.
   Soldiers were pursuing rebels believed to be holding five
military officers they captured June 1 at a guerrilla checkpoint in
a nearby town, he said.
   In Davao del Sur province, soldiers killed five rebels Friday in
a battle on the outskirts of Davao city, 600 miles south of Manila,
Lt. Col. Franco Calida said. He said 15 rebels were wounded but
were able to escape.
   In Pangasinan province, the military reported that it uncovered
two mass graves Friday with 20 bodies in the village of San Macario
Sur, about 100 miles north of Manila. The victims were believed to
have been executed by communist rebels.
   At least 65 soldiers, policemen and civilian informers have been
killed in Manila this year in attacks blamed on the rebels, police
say.

   The wife of the deposed president of
Burundi sat in the VIP lounge of Nairobi's international airport
for the fifth straight day Saturday after being barred from
traveling to Burundi to see her children.
   The Burundi government, in a statement issued in Nairobi,
claimed former leader Jean-Paul Bagaza was orchestrating the
protest from Uganda. He has lived there intermittently since being
ousted in a bloodless coup Sept. 3.
   Bagaza's wife, Faust, has been living in the lounge at Nairobi's
Jomo Kenyatta International Airport since arriving from Uganda on
Tuesday, when she was refused permission to board Kenya Airway's
flight to Burundi. Burundi authorities advised Kenyan authorities
they would refuse landing permission to any plane carrying her.
   Mrs. Bagaza refused Kenya's invitation to stay at a hotel in the
capital, Nairobi, and continue her negotiations with Burundi
officials from there, the Burundi statement said.
   Bagaza has made several attempts to return home since his
ouster, which occurred while he was on official business in Canada.
Each time, Burundi's new leader, army Maj. Pierre Buyoya, has
closed the airport.
   Bagaza's wife was with him at the time of the coup, but their
four daughters, ages 9 to 13, were in Burundi.
   Burundi's ambassador to Kenya, Marc Nteturuye, reiterated
Burundi's offer to send Bagaza's children to him if he supplied his
address and told the government who should supervise the children
during the trip.
   ``The government of Burundi has waited and is still waiting for
an emissary to come to take the children,'' the government
statement said. ``Bagaza, instead of making a formal request to the
government of Burundi, has chosen this sensational method in
sending his wife to go on a hunger strike in the Nairobi airport
lounge.''
   Authorities refused to allow reporters into the airport to
interview Mrs. Bagaza. The African Lawyers Association has charged
the Bagaza children are living under bad conditions in Burundi.
Burundi denies that.

   A heat wave has caused a run on electric fans and
watermelons in the eastern cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, official
reports said Saturday.
   Temperatures have hovered at 100 degrees for the past week in
Nanjing with little relief at night, the Xinhua News Agency said.
   Shanghai on Friday recorded its second hottest day in 37 years
when the mercury rose to 99 degrees. The record was 100 degrees,
set in 1978.
   Television news showed Shanghai residents sleeping on cots
outside in hopes of catching a breeze. Xinhua said Nanjing
residents were doing the same.
   Sales of watermelons, China's favorite summer treat, have
soared, and prices in Nanjing have more than doubled, to about 8
cents a pound, Xinhua said.
   It quoted a salesman at the Xinjiekou Department Store in
Nanjing as saying they sold 1,000 electric fans on Friday alone and
that fan sales were five times higher than last year's.

   One area hit especially hard was Dongduchon, where 1,500 people
were evacuated to nearby schools and highlands, the officials said.
   The downpours destroyed seven bridges and 17 river or reservoir

   Officials today reopened beaches along the south
shore of Long Island that were closed for as many as three days
after needles, blood vials and other debris washed up on shore.
   Federal and state investigators said Friday that the debris that
had closed 25 miles of beaches did not appear to be hospital wastes
as originally thought, but instead looked like household and
boating garbage.
   Jones Beach, Robert Moses State Park and beaches on Fire Island
were reopened today to weekend beachgoers.
   City Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen C. Joseph said Friday that
the waste that washed up on a seven-mile beach in the city's
borough of Queens, causing officials to close it Friday, did appear
to be medical in origin. But Stern said today that the debris
seemed to be of ``local origin'' _ or syringes used by drug addicts.
   Joseph and New York City Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said
the evening tide Friday and the morning tide today brought nothing
new and the beach was reopened.
   Ron Foley, the Long Island regional director for state parks,
said officials searched Jones Beach, which was reopened Friday
afternoon, and Robert Moses Beach this morning and found no other
waste.
   Foley said he believed the problem with the waste washing ashore
is over.
   Debris that collected since Wednesday on the Long Island beaches
included fewer than three dozen syringes of the type used for
insulin injections, three blood vials, vials associated with the
drug crack and some plastic tubing of an uncertain source, said
James Marshall, a spokesman for the federal Environmental
Protection Agency.
   ``We don't believe this is the result of illegally dumped
hospital waste,'' said Randy Braun, an EPA worker who examined the
ocean water from a helicopter.
   Ice cream sticks were mistaken for tongue-depressors, a
carpenter's mask was thought to be a surgical mask and a pair of
household rubber gloves used by a lifeguard to pick up wastes from
the beach were taken for surgical gloves, said August V. Sellitto,
an assistant to U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney of Brooklyn
Borough, who has been investigating the episode.
   Eight miles of Long Island beaches in the town of Bablyon were
closed Friday for the first time. In addition, Long Island's Tobay
Beach and six small beaches on Fire Island were closed for the
second day.
   In Long Island's Nassau County, health department tests of the
ocean water indicated it was in good to excellent condition, with
minimal risks for bathers. Additional tests are planned for the
weekend, the department said.
   The garbage recovered from the beaches will be turned over to
the U.S. attorney's office to determine whether it can be traced
and whether criminal charges are appropriate, said U.S. Rep. Thomas
Downey, D-N.Y.
   Twice in the last month, vials of blood that washed up on the
nearby New Jersey shore were found to contain traces of the AIDS
virus. The source of the vials has not been traced.

   Firefighters dug with picks and shovels
today to finish the last three miles of fire line around a
16,500-acre forest fire near Mount Rushmore that stopped growing
after thundershowers dampened the area.
   ``We're looking at 90 percent containment this morning,'' said
Dennis Neill, fire information officer. ``We got some good work
done last night.''
   Today's forecast was for warmer, drier weather, he said. But on
Friday thundershowers lifted the spirits of the estimated 1,200
people fighting the fire south of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.
About 100 of the men and women concentrated on finishing the fire
line today.
   ``With the combination of the lower temperature, lower wind
speeds, higher relative humidity and the rain, I'd say we got a
significant amount of help on the fire,'' fire information officer
Jerry Hagen said.
   Lightning is believed to have started the fire Monday night in
Custer State Park. It spread Wednesday into the Black Hills
National Forest and briefly threatened Mount Rushmore and the town
of Keystone.
   Twenty-seven miles of fire line were complete this morning,
Neill said. Smoke from the fire was no longer visible in Custer,
about four miles away.
   Hagen said one drawback to the thunderstorms was lightning that
could cause new fires, but he added: ``If we get some moisture
along with the lightning, I think we'll be hitting it pretty good.''
   Thirty families living along French Creek Road outside the west
boundary of the park were allowed to return home at their own risk
today, but the area remained closed to the public.
   Residents were ordered to evacuate Friday after flames jumped a
highway on the southwest edge of the fire. Officials said the
flames had burned within 1{ miles of some of the homes.
   Custer State Park remained closed to the public with police
stationed at the entrances.
   Crews for Black Hills Power & Light Co. returned to the park
Friday to restore electrical service. Electricity was shut off
Wednesday night to prevent any live lines from falling on fire
crews, said Joe Rovere, a company spokesman. He said at least 30
utility poles would have to be replaced.

<HEAD>Pentagon Spokesman Gets Good Marks For Handling Iran Airliner
Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Airliner-US Policy Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard admits he is no
expert on the high technology of the Iranian airliner crisis but,
after more than 15 years in the State Department and at the White
House, neither is he any stranger to dealing with reporters in
times of trouble.
   For nearly 2{ hours during the past week, Howard fielded
questions in the cramped Pentagon briefing room about such things
as transponders, air corridors, black boxes and the differences
between Mode 2 and Mode 3 electronic signals.
   He had been a State Department public affairs officer dealing
with the Philippines when President Ferdinand Marcos was forced
from office.
   He had been spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus when Shiite
gunmen seized a TWA airliner and killed Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   He had been expelled from Poland for his contacts with Polish
intellectuals after the Warsaw government declared martial law in
1981.
   He had been a stand-in spokesman at the White House at the
height of the Iran-Contra crisis.
   But nothing in his career had been quite like this.
   ``It's a very different environment from the White House,'' he
said in an interview. ``Everybody has an opinion and a point of
view, and the place is so big, there are so many points of view,
there are so many kinds of experts, and not all those experts
agree. ... And so we have the battle of the experts in the briefing
room some of the time.
   ``The long-time news people here are the ones that, on some
issues, it's very difficult to deal with, because you end up
getting a counterbriefing from the floor.''
   In the give-and-take, Howard sometimes simply has told reporters
that their questions go beyond his technical knowledge, saying, for
example, ``I am not the final authority on widths of air
corridors.''
   ``I am simply trying to explain the matter the best I can with
the information available to me,'' he said Thursday.
   Television, newspaper and magazine reporters covering the
Pentagon generally agree that he has done a good job, although to
some he seemed a bit impatient at times.
   ``He gets testy over some things, as most any briefing officer
does, but by and large he tries to be helpful,'' said Carl
Rochelle, Pentagon correspondent for Cable News Network. ``He tries
to answer your questions. If he can't answer them, he tries to make
it clear to you that he can't answer them, and sometimes he even
tries to help when he can't answer.''
   Bruce van Voorst, national security correspondent for Time
magazine, said, ``I`m amazed that Dan dares to stand up in front of
that crowd out there, which is for the most part a pretty
professional operation, and talk about Mode 2 or Mode 3 operations
and that sort of stuff. He has obviously made every effort to at
least become reasonably familiar with the technical issues he was
talking about.''
   David Evans, Pentagon correspondent of the Chicago Tribune,
said, ``I was very pleased on Tuesday that he took an hour to have,
I think, a viable exchange with the assembled reporters.''
   The twice-weekly Pentagon briefings usually last about half an
hour. Tuesday's was roughly an hour and Thursday's was more than 80
minutes, almost entirely devoted to the shooting down of an Iranian
Airbus by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes on Sunday.
   ``This is not the kind of a story that any spokesman likes to
deal with, of course, but all you can do is the best you can,''
said Howard.
   The spokesman, 45, from Chattanooga, Tenn., is married and has
three children, the oldest a boy studying astronomy at Boston
University. His wife, Mary, a real estate agent, watched him brief
on Thursday for the first time.
   Although he may not know everything about transponders, Howard,
does have some technological expertise he can call upon. He is an
old car buff, and likes to fix them up himself.
   The airliner incident and the current investigation of Defense
Department procurement are the biggest stories he has had to handle
since he came to the Pentagon in February as assistant secretary of
defense for public affairs from his previous post as a deputy White
House press secretary.
   The week after the procurement story broke in mid-June, Howard
had planned to go on vacation. He hasn't had the vacation yet.

<HEAD>Heat Wave Boosting Ozone Levels Over Big Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heat wave in much of the country is
pushing up concentrations of ozone, a major air pollutant, over big
cities to levels sometimes not seen for a decade.
   ``We are having an absolutely horrendous summer,'' commented
Bill Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air
Pollution Program Administrators Association, on Friday.
   Ozone prompted air pollution advisories in Chicago every day
last week and caused standards to be violated in Vermont for the
first time in recent memory.
   Several states and cities warned people with lung problems to
curtail activities and stay inside during the afternoon. New York
had a statewide advisory on Friday.
   The new peaks come at a time when the Environmental Protection
Agency is considering whether new ozone standards are needed
because of unexpected lung damage under certain conditions.
   They also coincide with warnings from some scientists that the
long-predicted ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth has
begun, and hot, dry ozone-prone summers are going to become more
frequent.
   James Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, says hot summers _ with ``hot'' defined as
the warmest one-third of all summers in 1951-1980 _ could occur
half the time in the mid-1990s.
   Heat speeds up ozone formation. Temperature inversions may trap
ozone near the ground and keep it from dispersing.
   Though in the stratosphere ozone protects the earth from harmful
ultraviolet rays of the sun, at ground level EPA has defined it as
unhealthy in concentrations over 0.12 parts per million for an
hour. Ozone constricts the air passages in the lung. It is the
chemical than makes your chest feel tight in smog.
   Three things make ozone: sunlight, oxides of nitrogen from
burning fossil fuels and compounds like those found in unburned
gasoline vapor, which react with the nitrogen oxides.
Concentrations peak in the afternoon and decline at night.
   The chief weapon for fighting ozone is reduction of gasoline
vapors through controls on cars. Some areas require auto
inspections and vapor recovery at service stations.
   The junking of older, dirtier cars has brought cleaner air to
many cities, but EPA lists 68 cities and rural areas as violating
ozone standards.
   The latest research, part of a wave of new findings that started
about two years ago, could mean an additional standard covering a
longer period like six or eight hours, said Bruce Jordan, head of
the standards section in EPA's air program. That could take 18
months to develop, he said.
   Most ozone research has concentrated on peak exposure, but new
work shows that several hours of exposure at elevated levels means
it takes less exercise to bring on restricted breathing. ``We've
seen an effect at 0.08 ppm for 6.6 hours,'' said Jordan. ``Our real
concern is multiple hits (of peaks and valleys of exposure) ... you
seem to get more damage than with a constant exposure.''
   Animal studies show that lung damage from high concentrations
tends to persist, something the agency hopes to confirm or rule out
through human autopsy studies.
   Some reports from the field:
   _At Bennington in the southwest corner of Vermont, a monitor
recorded ozone concentrations of 0.125 ppm on two days in June.
``I'm not prepared to say what the origin is, but the majority has
to be interstate transport,'' said Brian Fitzgerald of the state
Natural Resources Agency.
   In other words, pollutants emitted in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, New York and other upwind points early in the day were
still forming ozone after having been blown into Vermont.
   He said no one could remember the last violation, but he
believed it was three or four years ago.
   _Washington, D.C., as of Friday had seen 15 days in which the
standard had been violated, compared with six expected in a normal
year. The peak reading, 0.19 ppm on Thursday, has not been matched
in nine years.
   _Chicago has had nine days over the standard, compared with an
estimated seven in a normal year. The city issued its first
``yellow alert'' in a decade, the first step up from an advisory,
for readings at three monitors over 0.20 ppm last Thursday, with a
peak of 0.223 ppm.
   _Louisville, Ky., has had seven days over the limit vs. six in
all of 1987. Gary Wilson, technical services supervisor, said, ``My
only comment is, Lord, send us some rain.'' But the long-range
forecast, he said, is ``dismal,'' with the same weather pattern
expected for all of July.
   _Five cities in Pennsylvania _ Harrisburg, Scanton-Wilkes Barre,
Reading, Altoona and Erie _ have had readings high enough this year
alone to win them official designation as ``non-attainment areas,''
something EPA does after averaging data for three years.
   _Richmond, Va., has had nine days above the standard this year,
tying the 1983 record.
   _New York City has had 11 days over, compared with 16 in all of
last year.

<HEAD>New Rules Tightening Immigration To Britain Start Aug. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new law making it harder for some Commonwealth
citizens to immigrate to Britain takes effect Aug. 1 over
objections from critics who say it is discriminatory and will break
up families.
   Under the law, male Commonwealth citizens living in Britain will
have to prove they can financially support their families before
relatives living abroad are allowed to join them.
   The law will require proof that the families have somewhere to
live in Britain and that a marriage was not entered into primarily
for immigration reasons.
   The Aug. 1 start-up date for the new law, written by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, was announced
Friday by the Home Office, which is responsible for immigration.
   The opposition Labor Party opposed the law as it proceeded
through Parliament but failed to stop it. The bill formally became
law on May 10 but left it up to the government to announce when the
new measures would come into force.
   ``This is a shameful betrayal of the promises given by
successive Home Secretaries and will cause great misery and
hardship,'' said Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader of the Labor
Party. He said Labor would fight for immigration controls that
respect family unity.
   The government said the new law was necessary because it was
being left with the responsibility of supporting families of
immigrants who couldn't afford to do so themselves.
   The government also charged that in some cases, marriages were
entered into solely to permit people who would not otherwise be
allowed in to come to Britain.
   Timothy Renton, a junior minister of state at the Home Office,
said: ``The changes... will improve our ability to carry through
the government's commitment to a system of immigration control
which is both firm and fair.''
   Of Britain's 56 million people, an estimated 2.4 million are
non-white, mostly immigrants who arrived after World War II from
the so-called New Commonwealth countries of Asia, Africa and West
Indies and their descendants.
   The Commonwealth is a 48-member organization of Britain and its
former colonies. Critics said the new measures unfairly target
Bangladeshis in particular, the last wave of immigrants of the
Commonwealth.
   In 1961, the annual number of immigrants coming to Britain from
New Commonwealth countries reached 136,000. The next year, Britain
introduced its first controls on immigration by Commonwealth
citizens.
   More curbs introduced by successive governments followed, and
the annual number of immigrants admitted to Britain now stands at
under 47,000, the lowest level 1962.

   Nearly 40,000 people have applied for
political asylum in West Germany in the first six months of 1988,
and the number could top 100,000 by the end of the year, Interior
Minister Friedrich Zimmermann said Saturday.
   He said if the number of asylum seekers continued to grow at the
present rate, the annual total could equal the record years of 1980
and 1987, when more than 100,000 people requested asylum.
   By the end of June, 39,885 people had applied for asylum, about
36 percent of them from Soviet bloc countries, Zimmermann said.
   The largest number of asylum seekers so far this year came from
Poland, with 12,136, followed by 7,543 Turks, 5,251 Yugoslavs,
3,784 Iranians, 1,308 Lebanese and 1,139 Pakistanis, Zimmermann
said.

   In the aftermath of labor unrest this past
spring, the government is moving to hasten economic reform,
increase supplies of consumer goods and legalize some independent
groups in hopes of heading off more outbursts.
   But some opposition quarters doubt the government will succeed
and that more strikes are inevitable.
   An unknown factor, however, is Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
reformist Soviet leader who is scheduled to visit Poland sometime
soon.
   Five strikes in Poland from April 25 to May 10, and brief
stoppages or strike threats in 25 more workplaces, constituted the
worst labor unrest in the country since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown on the Solidarity independent trade union.
   The spring strikers demanded the legalization of Solidarity and
wage increases to counter price increases of 45 percent so far this
year.
   The rising prices are part of the government's multifaceted
program to reform the moribund economy.
   The program calls for introducing market equilibrium through
higher prices, encouraging private and managerial enterprise and
reducing central economic controls _ all similar to what Gorbachev
is attempting in the Soviet Union.
   ``The recent events produced an impulse to think deeper and move
faster,'' said one senior Communist Party activist, speaking only
on condition of anonymity. ``There is no way back. The only way is
forward and forward with much bigger steps.''
   The Polish leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, emphasized the need
for quick improvements in production in an unusual, eight-hour
meeting June 5 with the directors of the country's 41 largest
enterprises.
   Jerzy Malkowski, spokesman for the economic reform program, said
the government plans to introduce some steps ahead of schedule.
Long-awaited laws on setting up private businesses and easing
limits on foreign investment were approved by the government
shortly after the strikes and are expected to be enacted by the
Sejm (parliament).
   In one of the first uses of new special economic powers, the
government cut off tax benefits for companies that increase exports
at the expense of supplies for the domestic market, Malkowski said.
   On the political front, the government has signaled that it will
grant legal status to several independent groups, including the
Economic Society whose aim is to promote and aid private
businesses, a Warsaw political discussion club and the dormant
Polish chapter of the PEN writers' club.
   But authorities remain firmly opposed to legalizing Solidarity,
an issue that many in the opposition regard as the litmus test of
officials' sincerity in reaching an accord.
   The Communist Party activist said legalizing Solidarity would
lead to an escalation of pay demands in the factories, which he
maintained Poland cannot afford in its current economic condition.
When the economy improves, he argued, authorities can then think of
allowing union pluralism.
   The answer does not satisfy Solidarity activists.
   ``The basic question at the moment is whether, on the part of
the authorities, there is political willingness for deep changes in
the system,'' said Bronislaw Geremek, a historian and leading
adviser to Solidarity. ``Poland at the moment needs a spectacular
change so that it could create a psychological shock.''
   Otherwise, he added, ``there is no possibility of launching
political and economic changes.''
   Legalizing groups like PEN would have been signs ``of
extraordinary political significance'' a year ago, before the
strikes, said Geremek. But now they are ``too little, too late''
because they are addressed to a limited circle of intellectuals and
do not try to answer worker frustrations, he said.
   Malkowski acknowledges that the average Pole has seen very few
benefits of the economic reform program so far and contends that is
hindering public support.
   ``Obviously one does not convince people by rhetoric and words,
but by facts. This is why I say this year the problem is that we
have too few facts.''
   The situation should be better next year when, he said, people
will see the effects of a freer marketplace and greater competition
and supplies.
   ``Now we have the paradoxical situation in which an item is more
expensive and not available,'' he added. ``I think this is one of
the more significant factors arousing social frustration. As long
as the warehouses and stores do not get filled with goods, society
will question the sense of price increases.''

   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard admits he is no
expert on the high technology of the Iranian airliner crisis but,
after more than 15 years in the State Department and at the White
House, neither is he any stranger to dealing with reporters in
times of trouble.
   For nearly 2{ hours during the past week, Howard fielded
questions in the cramped Pentagon briefing room about such things
as transponders, air corridors, black boxes and the differences
between Mode 2 and Mode 3 electronic signals.
   He had been a State Department public affairs officer dealing
with the Philippines when President Ferdinand Marcos was forced
from office.
   He had been spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus when Shiite
gunmen seized a TWA airliner and killed Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   He had been expelled from Poland for his contacts with Polish
intellectuals after the Warsaw government declared martial law in
1981.
   He had been a stand-in spokesman at the White House at the
height of the Iran-Contra crisis.
   But nothing in his career had been quite like this.
   ``It's a very different environment from the White House,'' he
said in an interview. ``Everybody has an opinion and a point of
view, and the place is so big, there are so many points of view,
there are so many kinds of experts, and not all those experts
agree. ... And so we have the battle of the experts in the briefing
room some of the time.
   ``The long-time news people here are the ones that, on some
issues, it's very difficult to deal with, because you end up
getting a counterbriefing from the floor.''
   In the give-and-take, Howard sometimes simply has told reporters
that their questions go beyond his technical knowledge, saying, for
example, ``I am not the final authority on widths of air
corridors.''
   ``I am simply trying to explain the matter the best I can with
the information available to me,'' he said Thursday.
   Television, newspaper and magazine reporters covering the
Pentagon generally agree that he has done a good job, although to
some he seemed a bit impatient at times.
   ``He gets testy over some things, as most any briefing officer
does, but by and large he tries to be helpful,'' said Carl
Rochelle, Pentagon correspondent for Cable News Network. ``He tries
to answer your questions. If he can't answer them, he tries to make
it clear to you that he can't answer them, and sometimes he even
tries to help when he can't answer.''
   Bruce van Voorst, national security correspondent for Time
magazine, said, ``I`m amazed that Dan dares to stand up in front of
that crowd out there, which is for the most part a pretty
professional operation, and talk about Mode 2 or Mode 3 operations
and that sort of stuff. He has obviously made every effort to at
least become reasonably familiar with the technical issues he was
talking about.''
   David Evans, Pentagon correspondent of the Chicago Tribune,
said, ``I was very pleased on Tuesday that he took an hour to have,
I think, a viable exchange with the assembled reporters.''
   The twice-weekly Pentagon briefings usually last about half an
hour. Tuesday's was roughly an hour and Thursday's was more than 80
minutes, almost entirely devoted to the shooting down of an Iranian
Airbus by the U.S. cruiser Vincennes on Sunday.
   ``This is not the kind of a story that any spokesman likes to
deal with, of course, but all you can do is the best you can,''
said Howard.
   The spokesman, 45, from Chattanooga, Tenn., is married and has
three children, the oldest a boy studying astronomy at Boston
University. His wife, Mary, a real estate agent, watched him brief
on Thursday for the first time.
   Although he may not know everything about transponders, Howard,
does have some technological expertise he can call upon. He is an
old car buff, and likes to fix them up himself.
   The airliner incident and the current investigation of Defense
Department procurement are the biggest stories he has had to handle
since he came to the Pentagon in February as assistant secretary of
defense for public affairs from his previous post as a deputy White
House press secretary.
   The week after the procurement story broke in mid-June, Howard
had planned to go on vacation. He hasn't had the vacation yet.

<HEAD>Bush's Vice Presidential, Campaign Staffs Sometimes At Odds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Because he is vice president as well as the
certain Republican presidential nominee, George Bush must contend
with twin staffs. And insiders say the two sometimes-feuding
factions have produced an ongoing tug-of-war over policy.
   A sharing of responsibility for Bush's daily activity between
chief of staff Craig Fuller and campaign manager Lee Atwater is
causing tensions within the Bush operation, according to campaign
officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   And while Bush has a committee of six trusted advisers to
oversee the broad strokes of his campaign, advisers claim that turf
battles are likely to continue until the vacant seat at the end of
the table is occupied.
   That's the chair reserved for the still-unfilled post of
campaign chairman, presumably being left open for Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III.
   ``At this point, with all due respect to everybody who's down
there, the final decision-maker is not in the room,'' said
Republican consultant Eddie Mahe, a Bush campaign adviser.
   Although officials in recent days have made efforts to smooth
over differences _ including a well-publicized strategy session
last week among President Reagan, Bush and top White House and
campaign aides _ Bush campaign workers still report some rough
going in the coordination department.
   Atwater is in charge of Bush's campaign staff and oversees all
political activity. Fuller, who works out of Bush's vice
presidential office in the Old Executive Office Building and is on
the public payroll, deals with the official vice presidential side
of Bush's routine, including scheduling.
   However, insiders said that Fuller has far more input over the
entire Bush operation, including all details of campaign
appearances and policy, than organizational charts might suggest.
   ``Fuller has got the keys,'' said a Bush campaign adviser
familiar with Bush's campaign operations.
   The adviser said Fuller has enormous say on all matters dealing
with Bush's schedule. And these days, Bush's schedule, not
surprisingly, is mostly political.
   ``Often, it gets to be a real bureaucratic problem,'' said the
adviser, who declined to be identified by name.
   Fuller and Atwater said no frictions exist and suggested that
the Bush campaign is well oiled.
   But officials in both offices claim privately that while Fuller
and Atwater make a show of working together, there are many times
when one side of the operation doesn't know what the other side is
doing.
   Frustrations about a lack of such coordination prompted the
former campaign communications director, Peter Teeley, to quit his
job in May.
   For one thing, until recently Bush had two separate press staffs
_ one answerable to Atwater, the other to Fuller.
   Now, all campaign-related inquiries are fielded through the
office of Shelia Tate, Bush's new press secretary, who said she has
``unbridled input and access'' to Bush.
   One of her first acts was to put a halt to the mailing of Bush
campaign speeches to news organizations by the office of the vice
president _ at taxpayers' expense.
   James Lake, Bush's senior communications adviser, said there
still may be glitches, but fewer than before. ``Sometimes, the
campaign may seem top heavy. But that's what's required if it's
going to work.''
   David Carmen, a GOP consultant, said that fragmented
jurisdiction is not new with the Bush campaign. ``The Reagan
campaign had a lot of factions. I'm sure it's frustrating for
everybody involved, but they both (Atwater and Fuller) have valid
perspectives.''
   However, Carmen said, Bush should ``leave the campaigning to
Atwater and the scheduling to Fuller. Then they'll be in good
shape.''
   The campaign is overseen by a sort of board of directors,
composed of Fuller, Atwater, media consultant Roger Ailes, pollster
Robert Teeter and two close friends of Bush, former New Jersey Sen.
Nicholas Brady and Texas oilman Robert Mossbacher.
   The group meets, sometimes as frequently as once a week, to
discuss strategy.
   According to Fuller, general concepts of the vice president's
schedule are discussed at these meetings, but not the details,
which he said are worked out between himself and Atwater.
   Ed Rogers, deputy to Atwater, said that ``we've done all right
so far'' in seeking to coordinate the different roles of the office
of vice president and the campaign office. In the meetings of the
six campaign officials, ``everybody brings a unique set of
responsibilities to the table,'' he said.
   Treasury Secretary Baker is expected to join the campaign around
the time of the Republican convention Aug. 15-18.
   Meanwhile, friction between an official staff and a campaign
staff ``come with the territory'' when an incumbent is running
either for re-election or for higher office, said GOP consultant
Mahe.
   ``There are going to be misunderstandings, there is going to be
confusion, there are going to be personality battles, there are
going to be ego wars,'' Mahe said.
   ``But it will never be as brutal as it is to deal with an
incumbent U.S. senator. Because at least here, the two staffs may
be in different buildings but the buildings are only four blocks
apart. When you've got an omnipotent U.S. senator's staff and a
poor campaign staff out in the state someplace, then you have real
double grief.''

   Vice President George Bush rules out paying reparations to
Iran's government but says the Reagan administration is considering
compensating families of the 290 people killed when the U.S. Navy
shot down an Iranian jetliner. Michael Dukakis says ``some form of
humanitarian assistance would probably be appropriate.''
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee-to-be, said Friday in
Atlanta he feels ``terribly sad for the families of those people''
who died in the downing of the Iranian passenger plane by an
American warship in the Persian Gulf last Sunday.
   ``I would never, ever under any circumstances offer reparations
to the Iranian government,'' Bush said. He added that he
understands payments to the victims' families are being considered
by the administration.
   In Washington, President Reagan also said the question of
compensating the families is among matters ``under consideration.''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there were ``still some
open questions'' on the compensation issue.
   Dukakis indicated Friday in Texas that he favors payments to the
families. ``I think some form of humanitarian assistance would
probably be appropriate,'' said the Massachusetts governor and
likely Democratic presidential nominee.
   Bush told Nebraska Republicans today via a telephone hookup that
polls showing people think Dukakis is more conservative than he is
are ``crazy, nutty.''
   Speaking from Washington, D.C., to more than 300 delegates of
the state GOP, Bush said Dukakis is a ``card-carrying member of the
American Civil Liberties Union,'' while ``I am a card-carrying
member of the National Rifle Association.''
   Dukakis planned to campaign in California, Oregon and
Washington. Jesse Jackson scheduled a meeting in San Francisco with
supporters of his Democratic presidential campaign.
   Republicans were continuing their unity rally today in Atlanta,
scene of the Democratic National Convention July 18-25, and
prepared to hear from Bush's former rivals Bob Dole of Kansas,
Senate GOP leader, and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
   Addressing the Republican rally Friday, Bush stressed national
defense policy and said ``multilateralism seems to be my opponent's
answer to Soviet aggression.'' Bush contended Dukakis would leave
the United States generally depending on the United Nations to
maintain peace in the world.
   At a news conference before the rally, Bush, questioned at
length about whether his campaign was properly repaying the
government for the cost of his campaign trips on Air Force planes,
maintained ``we are not abusing the public trust.''
   Bush may have used tax money on campaign trips, Democratic
National Chairman Paul Kirk said Friday at a news conference in
Atlanta, where he questioned whether the vice president can travel
in the next month without violating spending limits.
   Bush called Kirk's allegation ``an outrageous charge.''
   Dukakis, meanwhile, was still searching for a vice presidential
choice and campaigned in Texas with one potential running mate,
Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen Jr. of Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee. ``I'm pondering,'' Dukakis said of Bentsen at a rally
Friday in Texarkana.
   When asked if he wanted the job, Bentsen seemed to play down the
possibility. ``I don't think we have to worry about that,'' Bentsen
said.
   In Dallas, Jackson said Friday that his campaign does not have
any veto power in Dukakis' hunt for someone to share the Democratic
ticket and does not ``choose to exercise the appearance as though
we have a veto over anyone in the process.''
   Dukakis, responding to news from Washington that the nation's
civilian unemployment rate dropped in June to a 14-year low of 5.3
percent, said the figures masked economic suffering.
   ``National unemployment rates don't tell you a great deal about
what is happening in communities and neighborhoods and regions
across this country,'' Dukakis said. ``For one thing, a great many
of these jobs are low-wage jobs, many of them paying no more than
$7,000, $7,500 a year. They don't have health insurance,'' he added.

   Hundreds of workers clearing debris
from the collapse of a department store reached the first floor of
the three-story building today but had little hope of finding any
more survivors in the massive pile of rubble.
   Authorities said at least 16 people were killed and 47 injured
in the disaster, but six survivors _ four of them children _ were
pulled from the debris of the Amigo Store on Friday.
   ``By this time tomorrow morning, the building won't be there
anymore,'' Terry Ray, a construction foreman who was leading the
digging effort, said this morning. ``We're no longer allowing any
tunneling. We're in the process of taking apart the building layer
by layer.''
   Police Sgt. Dean Poos said rescuers using sensitive equipment
thought they heard noises, including tapping sounds, from within
the rubble and were encouraged.
   But later today, Poos said the workers believed they would not
find any more survivors.
   ``It doesn't sound like we'll find anybody else alive,'' Poos
said, adding the city had asked for more volunteers to help in the
clean-up.
   ``The crews here are a little bit tired and we need some help,''
Poos said.
   Meanwhile, an official told The Dallas Morning News that clogged
drainage holes allowed rain to collect on the store's flat roof,
possibly overloading it. The roof collapsed during a torrential
rain Thursday afternoon.
   ``The roof is not designed to carry all that weight,'' said
Brownsville building inspector Fernando Romero. ``It's a tragedy
and one that may happen again at any time.''
   A seven-member unit of the Pittsburgh, Pa.-based Special Medical
Response Team, which works in mine disasters, arrived late Friday
and burrowed through tunnels dug into the concrete, broken
cinderblocks, shattered glass and twisted steel.
   ``Things like this are always tough,'' said Monte Jenkins, a
spokesman for the team of six paramedics and a physician. ``The
process is to shore up the tunnels to make sure that no one else is
hurt while we are trying to rescue other people.''
   The collapse of the three-story store trapped an undetermined
number of people, many of whom were seeking shelter from the rain.
   The cause of the collapse remained unknown. Brownsville Mayor
Ygnacio Garza said investigations were being launched by the city,
the building's insurance company and the federal Occupational
Safety and Health Administration.
   Garza said the rainstorm, which poured 2 inches in less than 30
minutes, may have been a factor, but that other factors also may
have played a role.
   ``We have a report from witnesses that a bolt of lightning
struck behind the building and hit some transformers and perhaps
knocked them down,'' Garza said.
   Minimal construction standards and inconsistent inspections also
contributed to the tragedy, other officials charged.
   ``That old store was nothing more than a stack of blocks,'' said
Kermit Cromack, Cameron County's tax assessor-collector. ``This was
bound to happen sooner or later.''
   A 2-year-old girl who was pulled from the rubble Friday after
she was buried nearly a day ``appeared to have been protected by
some other people around her who are believed dead,'' said police
Lt. Victor Rodriguez.
   A 14-year-old girl also rescued was wedged between two concrete
slabs. Pamela Downing of the city's public utilities board called
the girl a ``miracle child'' for having survived.
   Cries from the children, feedback from microphones and seismic
tools, and dogs trained to search for humans led the rescue crews
to the survivors.
   Cheers and wild applause erupted from 300 onlookers as each
survivor was lifted from the tangle of concrete.
   A Brownsville maintenance worker, Freddie Gonzalez, 34, took
advantage of his 4-foot-8 frame to snake his way through the heaps
of concrete, widening a path for two workers who followed in the
90-degree heat.
   ``The people were running out of oxygen,'' Gonzalez said. ``We
ran a little tube through a small hole. Then we made a bigger hole
and put in a bigger pipe'' to get air to the victims.
   Other rescuers dug a makeshift 17-foot tunnel to reach some of
those trapped.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
met Indonesian officials and said he discussed human rights with
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia today during his last
official trip to Asia.
   Shultz arrived in Jakarta for talks with President Suharto and
other officials about informal talks scheduled July 25 in the
Indonesian capital aimed at a political settlement of the Cambodian
war.
   Earlier today, in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Shultz
met with Mahathir for three hours and said the Malaysian leader
assured him prisoners detained without trial in Malaysian jails
would be accorded their full rights.
   Twenty-eight U.S. congressmen, the Washington-based Asia Watch
human rights group and the New York City-based Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights asked Shultz to bring up concerns over detentions
under Malaysia's Internal Security Act in his talks with Mahathir,
the two human rights groups said.
   The act allows the government to arrest and detain people
without trial indefinitely.
   Last fall, the prime minister ordered the arrest of 106 people
critical of his government _ including the leader of the opposition
in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang. He said then that their arrests were
necessary because they had instigated racial clashes between the
country's Malays and ethnic Chinese.
   ``The subject was discussed ... fundamentally in a satisfactory
way,'' Shultz said, speaking to a news conference before leaving
for Jakarta, Indonesia.
   ``We took note that 71 people have been released and that the
prime minister and foreign minister assured me that that those
remaining under detention would be accorded full statutory and
constitutional rights and as time went on we would see them dealt
with properly,'' said Shultz.
   But on Friday, the Malaysian House of Representatives voted to
strengthen the security act so that detainees can no longer
challenge in court the reasons for their detention in court.
   When Mahathir became prime minister in July 1981, about 550
people were held without trial in Malaysian prisons.
   Shultz arrived in Malaysia from Bangkok, Thailand, where he held
talks with the foreign ministers of the member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   In Jakarta, he was met at the military airport by the defense
minister, Gen. L.B. Murdani. Shultz will hold talks with Suharto
and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas before leaving for the Philippines
Monday.
   Shultz also will visit Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan and
new Marshall Islands republic in the Pacific on the trip.
   Indonesia will be the host of informal talks between Cambodia's
Vietnam-backed government and three guerrilla groups. The
guerrillas have been fighting the government and Vietnamese troops
since Vietnam invaded in 1978.

<HEAD>Butler Found Innocent In Stolen Paintings Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The butler didn't do it, ruled 12 jurors who
deliberated the fate of a man accused by his wealthy ex-employer of
stealing two paintings worth more than $500,000.
   Rune Gunnar ``Roy'' Donnell, a Swedish butler who had been
jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail since his arrest last September,
was freed Friday after a jury found him innocent of two counts of
grand theft.
   ``In other words, the butler didn't do it,'' said Donnell's
attorney, Donald C. Randolph.
   Donnell, 62, had worked for Elizabeth Keck for 15 years, but
quit about three months before she discovered a 19th-century
English painting missing from her Bel-Air home.
   The impressionist work ``I Fria Luften,'' by Swedish-born artist
Anders Zorn, was reported missing last September. A French work,
``Fete Gallante,'' also was missing.
   The paintings were sold to a Stockholm, Sweden, firm that paid
$500,000 for ``I Fria Luften,'' and $5,000 for ``Fete Gallante.''
   Donnell testified that he received permission to act as Mrs.
Keck's agent in selling the paintings in Stockholm.
   Mrs. Keck denied Donnell's story and told police Donnell often
admired the Zorn painting and said it would fetch a high price in
Sweden.
   ``Suffice it to say that we feel that the jury was misled by the
defense,'' said Mrs. Keck's attorney, Steven Knowles. He said she
was considering filing a civil suit.
   Mrs. Keck is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art and her
husband, Howard B. Keck, is a retired oilman who has been listed by
Forbes Magazine as one the country's 400 richest people.

<HEAD>Democrats To Convene For Southern-Style Coronation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats will convene in Atlanta next week in a spirit of unity
and optimism unseen in a dozen years, assuming that Michael Dukakis
can find a way to have Jesse Jackson on his side without placing
him on the ticket.
   As the Democrats' 1988 nominee-in-waiting, the 54-year-old
Dukakis unquestionably will command center stage in the convention
city in the heart of Dixie.
   And a southern-style political coronation it will be for the man
from New England, from the convention site itself to the selection
of a Texas Treasurer Ann Richards as keynote speaker and the
decision to have Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton place Dukakis' name in
nomination a week from Wednesday night.
   All this from a political party hoping to reclaim at least a
portion of the South that has become a political desert in recent
presidential elections, with the exception of Georgian Jimmy
Carter's Southern success in 1976 en route to the White House.
   Judging from the public opinion polls, the South remains a
difficult hurdle to overcome for Dukakis. Overall, Democrats
haven't enjoyed this much of a chance to win the White House since
Carter's narrow victory of a dozen years ago, even though Dukakis'
double-digit lead of late spring has all but evaporated in the wake
of persistent attacks by Vice President George Bush.
   While Dukakis' hold on a nominating majority of the delegates is
unquestioned and the convention's nightly two-hour prime time
program has been designed to convey his campaign themes, Jackson
has reserved a starring role.
   He'll arrive at the confab at the head of a ``Jackson Action''
three-day bus tour but denies his pre-arranged fanfare will steal
the thunder from Dukakis.
   ``It has nothing to do with thunder. Mr. Dukakis had no
intention of bringing any thunder to Atlanta,'' Jackson said
Thursday.
   The runner-up in the primary season will have the support of
more than 1,100 delegates at the convention and almost certainly
will have his name placed in nomination on Wednesday night,
providing a symbolic challenge to Dukakis' nomination. A noisy
floor demonstration will ensue.
   Jackson's campaign is organizing a series of events outside the
convention hall to maintain enthusiasm. In addition, Rep. Gus
Savage of Illinois, a Jackson delegate, holds a police permit for a
demonstration outside the Omni, which is expected to urge Dukakis
to name Jackson as his running mate.
   And Jackson's response to the nomination of the vice
presidential candidate on the final night of the convention has the
Dukakis campaign on edge. The Massachusetts governor is widely
expected to turn elsewhere for his running mate, and Dukakis aides
are concerned that rebellious Jackson forces may place their man in
nomination and force a prime-time showdown on the final night of
the convention, or perhaps even stage a public walkout.
   ``I think he has been and will be positive no matter what
happens,'' says Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a one-time
primary rival and one of the contenders to be Dukakis' running mate.
   But Dukakis' aides concede they need support from Jackson and
the millions who voted fo him during the primaries to defeat Bush
in the fall campaign.
   Jackson himself has provided conflicting clues of his intentions
in the five weeks since the primaries. He has criticized the
platform, campaigned publicly for the vice presidential nomination
and dismissed the other contenders as ``unknown quantities.'' Yet
he has spoken consistently of expanding the Democratic party, and
when he left Boston earlier this week after spending the Fourth of
July with Dukakis, he said, ``our interests converge.''
   Dukakis says he hopes to settle on a running mate and perhaps
squeeze in a little campaigning time before flying to Atlanta next
weekend. The leading contenders are believed to be Sens. John Glenn
of Ohio; Bob Graham of Florida; Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee as well as Gephardt and Rep. Lee Hamilton of
Indiana.
   Sens. Sam Nunn of Georgia and Bill Bradley of New Jersey have
ruled themselves out, as has House Democratic leader Tom Foley of
Washington.
   The vice presidenial issue aside, Democrats say there is little
controversy that could seriously mar the four-day spectacle that
party officials hope will speed Dukakis on his way to the White
House.
   Disputes over party rules and delegate credentials _ forums for
nasty disputes in conventions of the recent past _ have been ironed
out between the Jackson and Dukakis campaigns.
   The two sides are expected to continue meeting over their
platform disagreements. But Dukakis' aides seem to welcome a floor
vote to reject an expected Jackson call to raise taxes on the
wealthy and to freeze Pentagon spending.
   Unlike the conventions of 1980 or 1984, there has been little
question that Dukakis holds a majority of the delegates, and no
talk of a convention showdown that might loosen his grip.
   Aside from Jackson, nearly all of Dukakis one-time rivals have
not only warmly endorsed him but campaigned by his side in recent
days.
   Dukakis wrapped up the nomination early and also has benefitted
from the lack of animosity that has accompanied recent Democratic
races. In 1980, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy waged a last-ditch floor
fight in an unsuccessful attempt to wrest the nomination from
Carter. And in 1984, Walter F. Mondale struggled to win his
nominating majority on the final day of the primary season, while
fending off repeated challenges from Gary Hart and Jackson.
   However harmonious the proceedings are inside the hall, the
Democrats will attract the normal complement of street
demonstrators, ranging from white supremacists to gay rights
activists to animal rights groups.
   Not to mention a group of Georgians opposed to a four-lane
highway to Carter's presidential library.
   Republicans will try to grab their share of media attention at
the Democratic meeting. They will send several well-known officials
to Atlanta to make themelves available for newspaper and television
interviews.
   But one group's protest is another's opportunity.
   Local leaders figure the convention will be worth roughly $60
million to the economy.
   The Georgia Tourist Division has sent each of the 4,000-plus
delegates a can of state-grown popcorn with the words ``Georgia's
Popping.'' The hope is to entice some convention goers _ and their
convention dollars _ out of Atlanta and into other regions of the
state.

<HEAD>Zoning Error Leads 2 Couples To Build Modern Houses In Historic
District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One couple say they will fight an order
to tear down their nearly complete modern house that was built in
the town's historic district after the town mistakenly said the
property was zoned residential.
   A second couple are considering a similar fight.
   The zoning board voted unanimously Thursday to deny Fred and
Janet Sallah an exception to the zoning ordinance because the shape
and vertical siding of their silo-shaped house are not compatible
with other buildings in the district.
   Carolyn Baldwin, lawyer for the couple, said she would seek a
second hearing, and will go to court if the board does not change
its mind. She said state law says such zoning decisions can only be
made by historic district commissioners, and Canterbury has none.
   Another couple, Debbie and Richard Desmarais, said they were
considering a suit against the town after they were told they would
have to modify the ranch house they are building. Their house also
is nearly complete.
   Both couples applied for building permits earlier this year, and
the building inspector told them the property was zoned residential.
   Later, members of the zoning board later acknowledged that the
town zoning map was erroneous, but maintained that the historic
district and its New England style of architecture should be
preserved.
   Harry Kinter, chairman of the planning board who wanted to halt
the building, and building inspector Charles Cook, who favored
allowing the building, both resigned over the dispute.
   The Sallahs paid $75,000 for their 3.7 acres less than one mile
from the center of the town of about 1,500, and are building the
house from a kit valued at $50,000. The circular part is two
stories with a more conventional one-story attachment.
   Board member Jeff Brillhart said compensation may be the only
solution. Board Chairman Joe Halla said a decision on compensation
would be left to the town selectmen. Selectman John Pratt said he
didn't think the Sallahs should pay for the town's mistake, but he
did not offer compensation.
   Baldwin expressed frustration with the town's architectural
conservatism.
   ``If everybody had built houses that look exactly alike, we'd
still be living in wigwams,'' she said. ``You need to allow for
change and variety.''

<TEXT>
   A former state Highway Patrol officer
was sentenced to eight years in prison for running a brothel near
the popular Huntington Beach Pier.
   William Scott Taylor pleaded guilty last month to 29 sex-related
carges, including pimping, pandering and engaging in lewd and
lascivious conduct with minors. Superior Court Judge Luis Cardenas
sentenced him Friday.
   Taylor, 49, was known as James E. Sutton during the 14 years he
worked for the highway patrol. He retired in 1979 on a disability
pension.
   He agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the eight-year
sentence.
   In a handwritten statement to the court, Taylor admitted that he
had ``encouraged and procured'' five females _ including two
younger than 16 _ to work as prostitutes. He also admitted engaging
in sex acts with two teen-agers, giving them cocaine and
encouraging them to sell cocaine.

<HEAD>Second Step Taken In Rehabilitation of Bukharin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has readmitted Nikolai I.
Bukharin, a major Bolshevik theorist, and more than a dozen others
shot during purges under Josef Stalin a half-century ago, Tass
reported Saturday.
   Bukharin had been cleared in February of trumped-up spying
charges for which he was shot in 1938. But the second step in his
rehabilitation, restoration to party rolls, was not taken until now.
   Political rehabilitation had been expected, because Bukharin's
moderate economic program contains elements similar to those being
implemented by Soviet leader Mikahil S. Gorbachev.
   But in today's Communist Party announcement, the official news
agency said a special commission of the party's ruling Politburo
found that Bukharin and an associate, Alexei I. Rykov, had made
mistakes.
   ``However, their mistakes and dissenting positions are not of an
anti-party character,'' the commission said.
   The Tass dispatch did not detail the mistakes Bukharin and Rykov
had made.
   In the 1920s, Bukharin favored a continuation of Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy, which permitted some private
enterprise and left farms in the hands of the peasants. Bukharin
hoped to encourage farmers to combine property voluntarily and move
onto collective farms.
   Gorbachev's reforms also allow some private enterprise and
families to lease farmland from their collective and state farms
and till the soil themselves.
   Last November, Gorbachev announced that the drive to
rehabilitate the millions of victims of Stalin's purges would
resume. Stalin ruled from 1924 to his death in 1953.
   Tass said the Politburo commission heard a report from the party
control committee saying Bukharin and Rykov, expelled from the
party in March 1937, were readmitted June 21. The news agency did
not explain why it took 2{ weeks to announce the action.
   Fourteen other victims of Stalin's purges who had been tried
along with Bukharin and Rykov were also restored to party rolls,
Tass said.

   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said Saturday he sees eight possible explanations for why
the cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iranian passenger jetliner a
week ago.
   There is evidence that both supports and discredits each of the
explanations, according to Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.
   ``The bottom line is that we do not yet have a bottom line,'' he
said.
   Pentagon officials are reviewing last Sunday's incident in the
Strait of Hormuz, when the cruiser fired a missile and knocked down
the airliner and killed all 290 people aboard in the mistaken
belief that it was an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   Aspin, along with other legislators, have received a series of
classified briefings on Pentagon efforts to determine the sequence
of events and why the missiles were fired.
   Aspin said the main question centers around Pentagon claims that
the Vincennes was receiving signals from the jet on a frequency
reserved for military transmissions. Those transmissions led to the
belief than an F-14 jet fighter was approaching the cruiser, Navy
officials say.
   According to Aspin, the possible explanations for the attack are:
   _There were no military signals. That would mean the ship's
Aegis air defense system that detected the signals malfunctioned.
Aegis has problems, Aspin noted, but those problems don't include
picking up signals that aren't there.
   _Human error aboard the cruiser in reading the signals. Aspin
noted that although the crew members were experienced in reading
Aegis information, they hadn't spent much time in the volatile gulf.
   _The United States intended to fire at a civilian plane. Aspin
noted that argument is made by Iranian officials and he gave it no
credence.
   _The Iranian plane was carrying a military transponder on
purpose, which would have sent the fighter-like signals, because it
sometimes used the plane to ferry troops to combat.
   _The jetliner was carrying a military transponder that was
unknowingly turned on. Aspin noted that a transponder may have been
taken from military stockpiles, but he also noted that there is no
previous evidence that such a move occurred.
   _The jet was carrying a transponder that was activated on
purpose in hopes of causing the Navy to attack.
   _The military-type signals were sent from an F-14 that was
flying elsewhere in the gulf.
   _The military-type signals were sent from an F-14 that was
flying in extremely close vicinity to the Airbus.

   Divers working under 30 feet of water
used blowtorches Saturday to cut open a railway car and found 13
more victims of a train wreck in southern India, bringing the death
toll to 103, officials said.
   The massive rescue operation stretched into Saturday night as
divers searched for more bodies beneath the sunken coaches in Lake
Asthamudi in Kerala state.
   At least 103 bodies were recovered, and 167 people were
hospitalized, said Abdul Latif, a senior official in Quilon, a town
near the accident site. At least 1,000 police and navy personnel
were involved in the search.
   Nine cars of the crowded 14-car Island Express tumbled toward
the lake Friday after the train derailed crossing a bridge. Six
coaches were partly or fully submerged, and three hung into the
water from the bridge 15 feet above.
   It wasn't known how many people were on the train, which crashed
at about 1:15 p.m. At least 500 people were treated for injuries.
The train had a capacity of 1,700 people, but survivors said it was
extremely crowded.
   Vice Admiral Laxminarayan Ramdas, chief of the Southern Naval
Command, told The Associated Press by telephone, ``It's a ghastly
disaster. Today, the relatives have managed to accept their
miserable fate, but yesterday it was terrible.''
   ``The scenes in hospitals are reminiscent of casualties from a
battlefield .... Bruises, wounds, cuts all over,'' he said.
   Railway Minister Madhav Rao Scindia ordered a formal inquiry
into the accident. He announced that victims' families would be
given 100,000 rupees, or $7,142, in compensation.
   During a news conference in Quilon, he refused to comment on the
cause of the accident.
   Latif, a magistrate in Quilon district, said train engineer T.
Paul reported that the train developed mechanical trouble. Paul was
not hurt.
   Latif, reached by telephone, quoted Paul as saying that the
fast-moving train suddenly braked before the derailment.
   ``At this stage, we cannot be sure if it was human error or
mechanical failure,'' Latif said.
   Several survivors told Indian news agencies that they believed
the crew applied the brakes just before the train derailed.
   Government television and Indian news agencies reported that a
cave-in on the 540-foot bridge caused the derailment.
   Matthew John, a railway safety official, said two spans of the
bridge were damaged but that investigators believe this happened as
the train cars plunged into the water.
   Most of the victims died from drowning, Latif said.
   The line of grieving relatives outside hospitals in Quilon
stretched for a mile, news agency reports said.
   The crash was Kerala's worst train accident, but both witnesses
and officials said fatalities could have been worse without quick
rescue work by fishermen and farmers.
   Paddling dozens of long, narrow fishing boats, they rushed to
the wreckage and pulled out more than 200 passengers before rescue
workers could make it though the jungle to the lake.
   The Indian railway system is the second largest in the world,
carrying more than 9 million passengers daily.But train accidents
are common and claim hundreds of lives annually. Last year, 227
people died in 613 train accidents in India.
   The world's worst train accident occurred in India, according to
the Guinness Book of Records. More than 800 people were killed when
a train plunged into a flood-swollen river in the eastern state of
Bihar in June 1981, Guinness said.

<HEAD>US Says Soviets Preparing Troop Pullout From Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intelligence reports indicate the Soviet Union
may be ready to withdraw up to 65,000 troops from Hungary,
according to a senior State Department official.
   A pullout from the East European country has long been a subject
of speculation here and in Western allied capitals. Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already begun pulling back in Afghanistan
while Soviet-backed Vietnam has announced a troop withdrawal in
Cambodia.
   The U.S. official, who briefed reporters Friday under rules of
anonymity, said the United States would welcome the Hungary
pullout. He said Gorbachev may have already passed the word about
it to Warsaw Pact leaders.
   Last year Gorbachev set the stage for a nuclear missile
reduction treaty with the United States by announcing Soviet
short-range rockets would be withdrawn from Eastern Europe.
   The prospective move on Hungary could be a preliminary step to a
Soviet acceptance of Western terms for holding wide-ranging
negotiations to reduce conventional troops and armor concentrations
in Europe.
   At the same time, the Soviet leader is faced with growing unrest
in several Eastern countries, including Hungary, where economic
conditions are falling short of workers' expectations.
   A recent change in government in Budapest seemed to indicate
Hungary, in some ways the most liberalized of the communist states,
was about to embark on a reform program matching Gorbachev's
perestroika policies at home.
   In Prague on Friday, Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov repeated a
Kremlin proposal to withdraw the Red Army from all foreign
territory by the year 2000.
   But the Soviet government chief told Western reporters that such
moves could come only in the context of a general withdrawal _
involving other nations as well as the Soviet Union.
   ``Our proposal is this: let us take out all the armies,'' he
said. ``The armies in Czechoslovakia are part of the Warsaw Pact
armies. Let us agree on a radical solution in the West and in the
East.''

   Fire raced through an old, two-story
wood-frame hotel early today, killing three people, as nearly a
dozen other fires broke out in this small city in south-central
Washington state, officials said.
   Fire officials said arson was to blame for all of the fires
except the one that destroyed the hotel which was used as
apartments for low-income residents.
   In addition to the three dead, Assistant Fire Chief John Fifer
said one person was seriously burned. Firemen searched the rubble
for other possible victims; 20 to 25 people were reported to have
lived in the building.
   Fifer said the four victims were males, but added that their
identities and ages were not available.
   Firefighters were kept busy chasing from fire to fire, Fire
Chief Larry Dickinson said. About 10 fires broke out in garbage
bins, brush along fence lines and in another apartment 20 blocks
from the destroyed hotel.
   The fires at the second apartment building were set in a garbage
can and a laundry room, but were quickly extinguished, said fire
officials.
   A state fire marshall was called in to investigate the fatal
fire, Fifer said.

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Plants May Have Bought Used Circuit Breakers Listed
As New</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear power plants across the nation may
have bought used circuit breakers that were falsely labeled as new,
according to documents filed in federal court by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   The NRC is investigating five southern California companies for
their alleged role in supplying the circuit breakers, which serve
the same function as fuses in shutting off power to prevent short
circuits or fires.
   The NRC is unsure where the breakers are being used or what
dangers they present, except that they appear prone to failure,
officials said.
   After seizing documents during searches at the companies'
offices Thursday, the NRC sent notices Friday to nuclear power
plants across the United States.
   ``We are advising plant operators of what we are doing, but we
are not asking them to do anything at this time,'' said Frank
Ingham, an NRC spokesman in Washington.
   It is too early to determine the extent of the potential
problem, Ingham said.
   Federal officials said the used breakers were first discovered
at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo when
they failed tests there four months ago.
   According to court documents, the breakers that failed at Diablo
Canyon were purchased for use in non-safety-related areas, or areas
that are separate from a plant's nuclear reactor.
   However, an examination of breakers seized from the five
companies showed that it would be possible for power plant workers
to believe that a breaker was new and to ``upgrade a circuit
breaker to a safety-system use,'' wrote Robert Marsh, the NRC's
regional director of investigations.
   According to a warrant filed in federal court, the following
companies were searched: ATS Circuit Breakers, General Circuit
Breakers, HLC Electric Supply Co., General Magnetics and AC Circuit
Breaker-Electrical Supply.

   Israeli security forces clashed with Arab
protesters in six towns and cities today as Palestinians heeded
underground uprising leaders and shut down the occupied Gaza Strip
and West Bank.
   At least 32 Palestinians reportedly suffered injuries from
beatings, rubber bullets, and tear gas, Israel radio and Arab
reports said.
   The army put the injured figure at 11, saying it included an
Arab teen-ager who suffered a bullet wound after a clash in the
Gaza Strip and a soldier who was hit in the shoulder by a large
rock.
   The violence broke out a day after Israel launched a crackdown
on the uprising by ordering 10 Palestinians deported after accusing
them of planning a series of anti-Israeli attacks and riots.
   Today's strikes paralyzed commercial life by shutting shops and
halting public transportation in Arab east Jerusalem, Nablus,
Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem and Gaza City.
   In one clash, soldiers opened fire at the Aida refugee camp near
Bethlehem after several Palestinians tried to grab a gun from one
of the troops and one of them threw stones, an army spokesman said.
   Six Arabs were injured by rubber bullets, the spokesman said.
   Troops also confronted rioters outside the villages of Abwein
and Arura near the West Bank town of Ramallah, beating and injuring
three, including a woman, the radio said.
   The army confirmed the incident saying soldiers used
``reasonable force'' to detain Arab protesters after several dozen
of the demonstrators blocked roads near the villages and pelted
troops with large blocks.
   One soldier was hit in the shoulder by a block and taken for
medical treatment, the army said.
   Troops also injured three Arab protesters during a 90-minute
clash in Bani Naim near Hebron, Arab news reports said.
   Among the casualties was a 45-year-old woman identified as
Itimad Daoud Al Manasra, 45, who was hit by three rubber bullets
and two Arabs treated after inhaling tear gas, the reports said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers detained 20 Palestinians
and beat one of them after a stoning incident in Beit Hanoun, just
north of Gaza City, said an Arab reporter, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The reporter said Shawki Mohammed Khalil Odeh, 22, told him from
his bed at Alia Hospital in Gaza that soldiers detained him at his
home after the stoning incident, beat him about the head and kicked
him.
   Soldiers also maintained curfews for a second day on four
refugee camps and part of a fifth in Gaza, Arab news reports said.
   On Friday, one Arab youth was killed and five were wounded in
clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The fatality raised to 216 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel occupied
in the 1967 Middle East war. Four Israelis also have been killed.
   Underground leaders, apparently from rival factions, issued
conflicting leaflets calling for a complete commercial shutdown.
Each leaflet called for strikes, but differed on when they would
begin.
   One leaflet distributed this week by an underground Islamic
group known as Hamas said today should be ``a day of escalation and
striking at Jews.''
   The army said Friday it would deport six men from the West Bank
and four from Gaza and accused them of planning and carrying out
recent anti-Israeli riots and attacks.
   The men, aged 23 to 45, all have served prison terms on charges
ranging from armed assault to membership in either Fatah or the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the army said.
Both are factions of the PLO, which Israel outlaws as a terrorist
organization.
   In a statement, the army gave no date for the deportations and
said the men could appeal the orders to a military advisory board
or Israel's Supreme Court.
   Israel has deported 21 Palestinians since the start of the
uprising despite repeated U.S. protests that the expulsions violate
human rights.
   Friday's fatality was in the West Bank town of Tubas. Troops
opened fire, apparently during a protest, and wounded Abdel Kader
Amer, who later died of his wounds, a hospital official said.
   The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating the
circumstances.

   Republican leaders on Saturday took turns
assailing Michael Dukakis in a rally just nine days before
Democrats gather in the same city nominate the Massachusetts
Governor for president.
   ``If you're undertaxed, vote for Dukakis. If you're overtaxed
... we want you in our party,'' proclaimed Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.,
one of several of Vice President George Bush's former challengers
for the GOP nomination.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., another former contender, said, ``We're
not going to run around this country and try to bloody up the
opposition. But let's contain (Dukakis) to Massachusetts.''
   The rally was the third in a series designed to raise money and
demonstrate Republican solidarity. The first two were in Denver and
Cincinnati.
   The theme of this weekend's meeting was winning the South. Bush
kicked off the weekend with a speech to a Friday night rally,
predicting the South would be solid for Republicans in November.
   Playing on a theme the GOP will use repeatedly in the South, he
attacked Dukakis' national defense policy as too reliant on U.S.
allies and not strong enough on nuclear arms and the Star Wars
missile defense system.
   `We don't want to rain on the Democrats' parade, they'll do it
by themselves,` Bush said, evoking cheers and laughter from the
partisan crowd.
   Some of the South's top elected Republicans joined in the rally
with appearances Saturday, including South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, Sen. Strom Thurmond, also from South Carolina, Gov. Bob
Martinez of Florida, and Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
   Thurmond called Dukakis ``a mere midget compared to George
Bush.''
   Martinez said the differences in experience between Bush and
Dukakis amounted to ``the tale of the tall and the short,'' using
the same analogy as Thurmond, referring to the difference in height
between the two candidates.
   ``Can you imagine the folly of them coming down South and
holding their convention?'' said Lee Atwater, Bush's national
campaign manager and a South Carolina native, in his speech
Saturday.
   Atwater said the convention would serve to highlight issues
where Dukakis' record would cost him votes in the South, including
that as governor he has been ``dumb enough to raise taxes in the
middle of a campaign.''
   Dukakis' support of gun control, opposition to the death
penalty, and the problems with Massachusetts' prison furlough
program also would make Dukakis unpalatable to Southernors, he said.
   Atwater said Dukakis' indecision on a running mate was ``making
Hamlet look like the rock of Gibralter.''
   ``After the rest of the public gets to know him (Dukakis) in the
South, this guy couldn't get elected dog catcher down here,'' he
said.
   Dole said Dukakis is ``simply embarrassed by American power.''
   ``Have you heard him say one kind word about President Reagan's
arms control triumph in Moscow?'' he said, referring to
implementation of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning medium and
shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Bush did not attend Saturday's sessions, flying off late Friday
for his home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Despite the rhetoric, Atwater predicted that Bush would fall in
the polls following the Democratic National Convention because of
all the media attention Dukakis will receive. He said most voters
would not decide until the final weeks of the campaign, and then
voters will move to Bush when they find out ``what an honest,
decent fellow he is.''

   President Reagan, saying that ``the time for
excuses and delays is long past,'' appealed to Democrats in
Congress today to appoint members to a task force aimed at
stripping politics from the national drug debate.
   In his weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office, the
president also disclosed that White House employes were given
notice on Friday that random drug testing will begin in 60 days.
   Reagan recounted the formation of ``Just Say No'' clubs as part
of first lady Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign among youth, and
said, ``I figure if young people across the country can come
together against illegal drugs, then why shouldn't the grown-ups in
Washington be able to do the same?''
   ``In May, I proposed that both houses of Congress, both sides of
the aisle, join together with our administration in a bipartisan
executive-legislative task force to advance America's uniform
anti-drug policy.''
   ``If we are going to get the drugs out of schools, we need to
get the politics out of drugs,'' he said.
   ``I believe that partisan bickering or seeking political
advantage can only impede our progress in seeking to achieve a
drug-free America,'' the president said.
   ``I hope that the Democratic leaders in Congress will now join
in this united effort,'' he said. ``The time for excuses and delays
is long past.''

   In the Democratic response to the president's speech, Rep.
Charles B. Rangel of New York, chairman of the House Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, also discussed the drug issue, saying
that outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III had ``failed the
American people by not putting together the type of cabinet team
necessary to start the fight in the war on drugs.''

   Before Reagan prodded Democrats to get on board his joint
executive-legislative task force, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater voiced hope that the appointments would still be made.
   Asked why Democrats had not yet done so, Fitzwater said: ``Well,
we believe they will ... because they've expressed interest in the
drug issue, they have said they care about it and would like to
develop some initiative. ...
   ``They're waiting to get reports from their committee chairmen
and others who are advising them. I just can't imagine, after all
the talk they've made around the country on drugs, that they
wouldn't want to participate.''
   Reagan said May 16 in a speech to the graduating class of the
Coast Guard Academy that the national drug policy debate had become
too politicized. At the time, he called on Democratic and
Republican members of Congress to join the executive branch on a
task force to recommend solutions.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., named members of their chambers to
the task force some time ago.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., have not named their members.
   Reagan had said in the Coast Guard address that little headway
could be made in the effort to combat drug abuse and drug
trafficking so long as national debate on the issue took on
partisan tones.
   Reagan did direct the members of the task force to concentrate
on strategies aimed at attacking demand for illegal narcotics. The
president had said in the past that interdiction efforts would be
futile so long as demand continued unabated.
   The president sent his marching orders to the
executive-legislative task force as Republican senators unveiled a
$1.5-billion-a-year anti-drug plan that would install a top drug
enforcement officer in the president's Cabinet, deny federal
benefits to users and allow the death penalty for convicted dealers.
   The measure, sponsored by Dole and 10 GOP colleagues, also would
boost the drug-enforcement authority of the Border Patrol and
Forest Service, launch a federal initiative against gangs and crack
down on illegal use of firearms.
   In his statement, Reagan said: ``Much has already been done, but
there is much more to do. The task force offers us the rare
opportunity to lift the battle above politics, to make broad
progress with bipartisan policy. ... We must not rest until the
message to every drug user is clear: We mean business. No more
drugs.''

<TEXT>
   The House of Representatives voted
to strengthen the Internal Security Act, which allows the
government to arrest and detain people without trial indefinitely.
   The House passed the law Friday and sent it to the Senate.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz visited Malaysia today
and said he discussed human rights issues with Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
   Last fall, the prime minister ordered the arrest of 106 people
critical of his government _ including the leader of the opposition
in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang. Mahathir said then that their arrests
were necessary because they had instigated racial clashes between
the country's Malays and ethnic Chinese.
   ``The subject was discussed ... fundamentally in a satisfactory
way,'' Shultz said at a news conference before leaving for Jakarta,
Indonesia.
   ``We took note that 71 people have been released and that the
prime minister and foreign minister assured me that that those
remaining under detention would be accorded full statutory and
constitutional rights and as time went on we would see them dealt
with properly,'' said Shultz.
   Twenty-eight U.S. congressmen, the Washington-based Asia Watch
human rights group and the New York City-based Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights had asked Shultz to bring up American concerns
over the detentions with Mahathir, according to the two human
rights groups.
   The official Bernama news agency reported that the amendments
passed by the House, among other things, ``prohibited any action,
suit, prosecution, or any other legal proceedings from being
brought, instituted or maintained in respect of any detention.''
   Forty-seven representatives supported the amendments and 18 were
opposed. The amendments will go to the Senate for approval later
this month and then to the king before they become law.
   The Senate is dominated by government appointees, and the king,
like Britain's Queen Elizabeth, is a constitutional head and
normally signs all laws passed by the legislature.
   ``By completely depriving the right of the people to seek legal
redress in court, the situation is worse than during the colonial
days,'' former foreign minister Rais Yatim, a governing party
member who opposes Mahathir, said during the parliamentary debate.
   Malaysia won independence from Britain in 1957 and inherited the
Internal Security Act from the days of colonial rule.
   Lee Lam Thai, acting leader of the parliamentary opposition,
said the amendments would prohibit anyone who has been improperly
detained from asking a court to secure his release.
   Deputy Home Affairs Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayub said during
the debate the government would not abuse its powers and that the
Internal Security Act was necessary for the security of the country.
   The U.S. congressmen and human rights groups have called for the
detainees to be brought to trial or released.
   About 80 people now are being held under the act. When Mahathir
became prime minister in July 1981, more than 500 people were under
detention.

   Police used mine detectors
Saturday to check cars arriving at a Pretoria rugby stadium as part
of tightened security measures following a series of bombings.
   A mine attached to a telephone pole exploded outside the
clubhouse of a field hockey team in a Johannesburg suburb. No
serious injuries were reported.
   At a rugby match in Cape Town, a police helicopter circled the
stadium.
   Last weekend, a car bomb exploded outside a Johannesburg stadium
as spectators left a rugby match. Two people died and 35 were
injured. Other recent targets included a video game arcade and a
beachfront restaurant.
   On Saturday, a large police contingent was on duty at Pretoria's
main rugby stadium. Spectators arriving for the game were searched
as they entered the grounds, and mine detectors were used to scan
underneath vehicles entering parking lots.
   Police have blamed the recent bombings on the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement, which has neither claimed nor
denied responsibility. The ANC is the main group fighting to
overthrow South Africa's government.
   Authorities across the country have launched a ``bomb awareness
campaign'' to encourage greater public vigilance. City officials in
Johannesburg are publicizing a special emergency telephone number
to be used for reporting suspected bombs, and the Cape Town Chamber
of Commerce has published a set of security guidelines to
shopowners.
   Even before the bombings intensified over the past four months,
posters were on display in many government buildings to help the
public identify limpet mines, one of the devices most commonly used
in the bomb attacks.

   Teddy bears are the newest tool of street-savvy
police in the Miami area, whose officers routinely deal with armed
drug smugglers and other criminals.
   ``I think these teddy bears will be a great tool in working with
children. We plan to stock at least two teddy bears in each patrol
car, and we'll start using them sometime next week in 50 of our
patrol cars in the northwest Miami area to see how it works out,''
said Metro-Dade Cmdr. Lou Diecidue.
   ``When a child sees a police officer in a negative situation
like an accident or maybe a child abuse case, that child is usually
very frightened,'' Diecidue said.
   ``We hope that offering these teddy bears will ease a lot of
that initial pain and fright they experience.''
   Miami police Sgt. Roberson Brown said all three shifts of his
patrol units will carry the bears and distribute them among poor
children throughout the city.
   ``We think this is a great idea, and we hope it will bridge the
gap sometimes existing between a small child and a police
officer,'' Brown said.
   Miami radio station WPOW-FM is working with area Burdines
department stores to collect at least 5,000 teddy bears for
donation to Miami, Metro-Dade, Hollywood and the Broward Sheriff's
police agencies.
   WPOW assistant promotions director Lori Alterman said the idea
came from a magazine article mentioning that Seattle patrol
officers carry teddy bears.
   ``We felt that if the officers approaching a crime scene where a
child is involved offer that child a teddy bear to hug and hold and
keep for his own, it would help ease a lot of the fear and anxiety
that the child experiences at that moment,'' Ms. Alterman said.
   ``We see it as a stranger offering the child something that's
not so strange.''

   President Reagan lauded outgoing Attorney
General Edwin Meese III today as a ``public servant of dedication
and integrity'' whose ``name has been cleared.''
   Reagan's weekly radio address, delivered from the Oval Office,
coincided with a published report that independent counsel James C.
McKay's investigation of the attorney general shows that Meese
initially indicated he may have had knowledge about possibly
illegal payments to the Israeli Labor Party in connection with a $1
billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   Meese announced his upcoming resignation Tuesday, the day
McKay's report, which has not been made public, was filed in court.
The attorney general said the independent counsel's investigation
vindicates him.
   ``With the announcement by Ed Meese, now that his name has been
cleared, that he will be returning to private life this summer, I
would like to take a minute to recognize a public servant of
dedication and integrity who has been a close friend for over 20
years,'' the president said.
   ``As counselor at the White House and as attorney general, Ed
Meese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals
behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement
and to fight organized crime,'' Reagan said.
   He said Meese also ``led our Justice Department as it
aggressively ``achieved more convictions for civil rights
violations than any previous administration.''
   He also praised Meese's anti-terrorism efforts, saying he
``worked closely with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute
those who wage war on innocent members of free societies.''

   Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, delivering the Democratic
response to the president's speech, said, ``Mr. President, now that
the attorney general has finally resigned, I sincerely hope that
you will take the initiative to appoint someone that can restore
the dignity and the integrity to this great office that it
deserves.''

<TEXT>
   The New York Times, which obtained portions of the independent
counsel's report, reported today that Meese was asked in November
1987 by McKay about his understanding of a memorandum from longtime
friend E. Robert Wallach on the pipeline.
   McKay asked whether Meese understood when he received the memo
in September 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would go
directly to the political party.
   McKay asked, ``Was that your understanding in September 1985
that was the arrangement?''
   Meese replied, ``Again, I can't recall specifically, but that
certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would
explain why Mr. (then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres was
personally interested.''
   However, two months later, Meese submitted a clarification of
his testimony, saying he didn't recall that part of the memo. The
clarification came a few weeks after the first news accounts
reported that the memo from Wallach to Meese mentioned planned
payments to the Labor Party, constituting a possible violation of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   Meese's lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, told the Times
that Meese had been consistent in his statements about his
knowledge of the plan to make payments to the Israeli Labor Party.
Lewin said Meese does not recall reading the portion of the memo
dealing with payments to the political party and that is what Meese
meant to say when he gave the statement to McKay in November 1987.
   McKay determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of a
bribery plan and that the available evidence is therefore
insufficient to conclude Meese's activities on behalf of the
pipeline violated the corrupt practices act.
   The independent counsel said his pipeline investigation was
hampered because Israeli officials, including Peres, were
unavailable to be questioned and several American witnesses invoked
their right not to incriminate themselves.
   McKay also said a sensitive Justice Department memo to Meese
about the pipeline was missing from his department files. Meese had
testified he had received the memo and might have shared it with
Wallach, said the report.
   The memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possible
U.S. backing for the financial and security guarantees for the
pipeline, according to the report.
   The memo from a department attorney and written at Wallach's
urging recommended a possible solution to the legal problem.
Department officials were unable to locate it in Meese's files,
said the report.
   McKay also found that Meese was ``closely involved'' in 1985 in
discussions about building the pipeline. McKay said the project was
of limited interest to the U.S. government until Meese made a
``highly unusual'' phone call to the White House in 1985 at
Wallach's request. Wallach was representing one of the project's
partners, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport. Meese repeatedly has
characterized his involvement in the project as limited.
   The McKay report also said Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns
told McKay he was ``astonished'' because Meese told him that an
offer of a high Justice Department job to Wallach was still pending
even after Meese learned that Wallach was the subject of a criminal
investigation.
   The report says Meese learned from his subordinates on April 6,
1987, that Wallach, who currently is under indictment on
racketeering charges in the Wedtech scandal, was the subject of a
federal criminal probe of Wedtech Corp., a South Bronx, N.Y.,
defense contractor.
   Meese immediately recused himself from all involvement in
Wedtech matters, but subsequently told Burns he ``had offered Mr.
Wallach the position of counselor to the attorney general'' and
``that the offer was still open.''
   Burns told McKay's office he was ``astonished'' to hear this
from Meese but ``maintained a `poker face' and responded by saying,
`oh,''' the report said. William Bradford Reynolds, head of the
department's civil rights division, eventually got the job instead
of Wallach.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, today I want to tell you about some new
anti-drug initiatives. But first, with the announcement by Ed
Meese, now that his name has been cleared, that he'll be returning
to private life this summer, I'd like to take a minute to recognize
a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close
friend for over 20 years.
   As counselor at the White House, and as attorney general, Ed
Meese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals
behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement
and to fight organized crime. And, in a system usually focused on
the criminal, he never forgot the victims of crime or their rights.
   As attorney general, Ed Meese led our effort to appoint highly
qualified federal judges who would crack down on crime and also
faithfully interpret the Constitution. He led our Justice
Department as it aggressively defended civil rights. In fact, this
administration has achieved more convictions for civil rights
violations than any previous administration.
   In fighting terrorism, Attorney General Meese worked closely
with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute those who wage
war on innocent members of free societies. And in our campaign
against the menace of illegal drugs, Ed Meese has been a central
figure, serving as chairman of the National Drug Policy Board.
   Now, let me turn to our anti-drug efforts. I believe that drug
testing is a key tool to help promote public safety and a drug-free
work force. In fact, to set a good example, White House employees
were informed yesterday that random drug testing would begin in 60
days. I hope the White House program will encourage increased
testing programs in the private sector.
   In addition, as I mentioned earlier, I have just approved a new
set of drug abuse policy recommendations. These proposals send a
strong message to drug traffickers and illegal drug users that we
have zero tolerance for those who sell or use illegal drugs.
   For example, we would require businesses and colleges that
receive federal funds to adopt effective, anti-drug programs. For
pregnant women who use illegal drugs, there should be priority
treatment to help them and their unborn children. We would give the
military a greater role in coordination with our drug enforcement
agencies.
   Criminals on probation or parole would be drug-tested and
testing positive might send them right back to jail. And yes, for
for those who commit drug-related murders or kill law officers, we
we favor a federal death penalty.
   Since 1981 when Vice President George Bush and I took office, we
have better than tripled total federal spending for drug
enforcement, prevention and treatment. And we've requested a
further 13 percent increase that will put nearly $4 billion into
the federal effort next year. And we're beginning to see results.
Arrests are up, seizures are up, and use in some categories is
coming down.
   But by far the most important development is the change in
attitude in America. You can feel it. People are angry about
illegal drugs. We're a patient people, but we've lost our patience
and this is good news because more needs to be done. And as never
before, the American people are doing it _ in their neighborhoods,
through their churches, at their schools and workplaces.
   For example, today 28 percent of our largest corporations have
drug testing programs. Communities are working with police to get
rid of drug dealers, and in thousands of schools throughout
American, there are now ``Just Say No'' clubs.
   I have to tell you that whole movement began when a young girl
asked Nancy what to do if someone offered her drugs. And Nancy told
her, ``Just say no.'' Well I figure if young people across the
country can come together against illegal drugs, then why shouldn't
the grown-ups in Washington be able to do the same.
   In May I proposed that both houses of Congress, both sides of
the aisle, join together with our administration in a bipartisan
executive-legislative task force to advance America's unified
anti-drug policy. I proposed this task force for a simple reason _
if we're going to get the drugs out of our schools, we need to get
the politics out of drugs. And fortunately on the drug issue, there
is near unanimous agreement. I can tell you that was not the case
seven years ago. But it is today.
   This is my final year in office, and I believe that partisan
bickering or seeking political advantage can only delay our
progress in working to achieve a drug-free America.
   Yesterday I gave a set of policy proposals to my representatives
to the executive-legislative task force. I hope that the Democratic
leaders in Congress will now join in this united effort. The time
for excuses and delays is long past. I hope that through this task
force we can all come together and work in good faith for the good
of this country.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   A newly released court document more directly
links a Pratt & Whitney vice president to the Pentagon fraud and
bribery investigation than the company has previously indicated.
   Officials at the East Hartford, Conn., jet engine manufacturer
have played down any alleged involvement by Eugene Tallia, who is
head of the company's Washington office as well as a company vice
president. The officials have said that Tallia's name appeared on
an FBI search warrant for the company's Washington office simply
because he is in charge of the office. The Associated Press
obtained a copy of the warrant last month.
   But another warrant, used by the FBI to search the suburban
Virginia home of a key figure in the probe, Melvyn R. Paisley,
revealed that agents were looking for notes, memoranda and other
correspondence between Paisley and Tallia regarding bidding
information from Pratt & Whitney's rival, General Electric Co.
Tallia was the only Pratt & Whitney official named in the warrant.
Pratt & Whitney is an operating unit of United Technologies Corp.
   The document, released Friday by the U.S. District Court in
Alexandria, Va., said that agents believed they would find
documentation in Paisley's McLean, Va., home with General Electric
bidding information for the F-404 engine. The search warrant of the
Pratt & Whitney office sought the same documents.
   The bidding information, if obtained by Pratt & Whitney through
Paisley during the contract competition, would have given the
Connecticut company an enormous advantage over General Electric.
   Federal investigators are looking into allegations that defense
contractors and consultants, many of them former military men,
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details that could be
vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars.
   No one has been charged in the case.
   Tallia and other company officials have refused to comment on
the investigation. A spokesman for United Technologies said
Saturday that ``since the investigation is ongoing and all of the
relevant facts aren't known, we simply aren't in a position to
comment further.''
   Spokesman Larry Bingaman added that company officials are
cooperating with investigators and that Tallia remains in his post.
   The contract to build engines for the Navy's F-18 fighter jets
had been held exclusively by GE. But in 1984, then-Navy Secretary
John F. Lehman decided to have the two contractors compete _ a move
that Paisley, who was then assistant Navy secretary, supported.
   GE and Massachusetts lawmakers complained at the time about the
dual-sourcing move and Lehman's decision to give Pratt & Whitney a
GE engine to help Pratt build its own F-404.
   The Navy's actions followed Pratt & Whitney's loss of its
longtime monopoly on engines for the F-15 and F-16 fighters.
   Last year, Pratt began winning about a third of the F-18 engine
contracts. Union officials have charged that GE's loss of some F-18
contracts cost up to 500 jobs at GE's engine-building plant in
Lynn, Mass.
   The newly released search warrant also reveals for the first
time the government's belief that unidentified Pratt & Whitney
officials paid Paisley during his tenure as assistant Navy
secretary in connection with information regarding another contract
that the two companies competed for.
   The document said that FBI agents sought ``information
pertaining to Paisley's support on behalf of Pratt & Whitney'' for
engines to power the V-22 Osprey, a helicopter-airplane hybrid
designed for vertical takeoffs.
   Pratt & Whitney was chosen over GE to be the second contractor
on that engine.
   Paisley resigned from his Navy post in March 1987 and set up a
lucrative consulting firm. Pratt & Whitney, one of major defense
contractors to hire Paisley, paid him $200,000 a year to consult
for the two engine programs, according to unidentified sources
quoted by The Washington Post.
   Tallia, 52, a company vice president, has headed Pratt &
Whitney's Washington office since 1979. Before that he worked for
25 years at Sikorsky Aircraft, another operating division of United
Technologies.

<HEAD>Dog Trainer Barbara Woodhouse Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dog trainer Barbara Woodhouse, whose teaching
methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died
Saturday at the age of 78, relatives said.
   Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire,
northwest of London after suffering a stroke a month ago. She
suffered a first stroke in 1984.
   Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said: ``We shall miss her very
much but she had been very ill for some time.''
   In the 1970s and early 1980s, millions of dog owners in Britain
and the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on the
British Broadcasting Corp. television program ``Training Dogs the
Woodhouse Way.'' Before long, loyal viewers were telling their
dogs, ``Walkies!'' as her byword caught on.
   Mrs. Woodhouse's book, ``No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a
bestseller in 1982.
   She insisted no dog was untrainable and showed they could be
taught within minutes with ``tone of voice, telepathy and a little
bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to
breathe into its nose.
   Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short
gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In
1980, she was ``flabbergasted'' to be named female TV personality
of the year in Britain.
   ``She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr.
Michael Woodhouse, said.
   The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north of
London.
   The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knack
with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned
she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice.
   She trained dogs as her three children were growing up and at
one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.
   She made her first dog training film, ``Love Me, Love My Dog,''
in 1955 using her Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theaters
around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance
sales of 25,000.
   Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when the
television program was running.
   She once told The Associated Press that because of the
television appearances, she could not go out in public without
being asked for her advice, but she said she didn't mind.
   The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going
through passport control at a London airport, the inspector said
``Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, today I want to tell you about some new
anti-drug initiatives. But first, with the announcement by Ed
Meese, now that his name has been cleared, that he'll be returning
to private life this summer, I'd like to take a minute to recognize
a public servant of dedication and integrity who has been a close
friend for over 20 years.
   As counselor at the White House, and as attorney general, Ed
Meese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals
behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement
and to fight organized crime. And, in a system usually focused on
the criminal, he never forgot the victims of crime or their rights.
   As attorney general, Ed Meese led our effort to appoint highly
qualified federal judges who would crack down on crime and also
faithfully interpret the Constitution. He led our Justice
Department as it aggressively defended civil rights. In fact, this
administration has achieved more convictions for civil rights
violations than any previous administration.
   In fighting terrorism, Attorney General Meese worked closely
with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute those who wage
war on innocent members of free societies. And in our campaign
against the menace of illegal drugs, Ed Meese has been a central
figure, serving as chairman of the National Drug Policy Board.
   Now, let me turn to our anti-drug efforts. I believe that drug
testing is a key tool to help promote public safety and a drug-free
work force. In fact, to set a good example, White House employees
were informed yesterday that random drug testing would begin in 60
days. I hope the White House program will encourage increased
testing programs in the private sector.
   In addition, as I mentioned earlier, I have just approved a new
set of drug abuse policy recommendations. These proposals send a
strong message to drug traffickers and illegal drug users that we
have zero tolerance for those who sell or use illegal drugs.
   For example, we would require businesses and colleges that
receive federal funds to adopt effective, anti-drug programs. For
pregnant women who use illegal drugs, there should be priority
treatment to help them and their unborn children. We would give the
military a greater role in coordination with our drug enforcement
agencies.
   Criminals on probation or parole would be drug-tested and
testing positive might send them right back to jail. And yes, for
for those who commit drug-related murders or kill law officers, we
we favor a federal death penalty.
   Since 1981 when Vice President George Bush and I took office, we
have better than tripled total federal spending for drug
enforcement, prevention and treatment. And we've requested a
further 13 percent increase that will put nearly $4 billion into
the federal effort next year. And we're beginning to see results.
Arrests are up, seizures are up, and use in some categories is
coming down.
   But by far the most important development is the change in
attitude in America. You can feel it. People are angry about
illegal drugs. We're a patient people, but we've lost our patience
and this is good news because more needs to be done. And as never
before, the American people are doing it _ in their neighborhoods,
through their churches, at their schools and workplaces.
   For example, today 28 percent of our largest corporations have
drug testing programs. Communities are working with police to get
rid of drug dealers, and in thousands of schools throughout
American, there are now ``Just Say No'' clubs.
   I have to tell you that whole movement began when a young girl
asked Nancy what to do if someone offered her drugs. And Nancy told
her, ``Just say no.'' Well I figure if young people across the
country can come together against illegal drugs, then why shouldn't
the grown-ups in Washington be able to do the same.
   In May I proposed that both houses of Congress, both sides of
the aisle, join together with our administration in a bipartisan
executive-legislative task force to advance America's unified
anti-drug policy. I proposed this task force for a simple reason _
if we're going to get the drugs out of our schools, we need to get
the politics out of drugs. And fortunately on the drug issue, there
is near unanimous agreement. I can tell you that was not the case
seven years ago. But it is today.
   This is my final year in office, and I believe that partisan
bickering or seeking political advantage can only delay our
progress in working to achieve a drug-free America.
   Yesterday I gave a set of policy proposals to my representatives
to the executive-legislative task force. I hope that the Democratic
leaders in Congress will now join in this united effort. The time
for excuses and delays is long past. I hope that through this task
force we can all come together and work in good faith for the good
of this country.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   President Reagan said Saturday Attorney
General Edwin Meese's ``name has been cleared'' by an independent
counsel investigation, but a Democratic spokesman said Meese
``failed the American people.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., in the regular Democratic response
to Reagan's weekly radio message, urged appointment of ``someone
that can restore the dignity and integrity to this great office''
and lead the fight against illegal drugs.
   Meese announced Tuesday that he would resign next month, saying
he had been vindicated by the investigation of his affairs by
independent counsel James B. McKay. McKay's report has been filed
in court, but not made public.
   The White House has said the president hopes to nominate a
successor to Meese during the coming week.
   Reagan, speaking from the Oval Office, said, ``With the
announcement by Ed Meese, now that his name has been cleared, that
he will be returning to private life this summer, I would like to
take a minute to recognize a public servant of dedication and
integrity who has been a close friend for over 20 years.''
   ``As counselor at the White House and as attorney general, Ed
Meese worked for stricter sentencing to put dangerous criminals
behind bars, and also for greater resources for drug enforcement
and to fight organized crime,'' Reagan said.
   He said Meese also ``led our Justice Department as it
aggressively defended civil rights'' and ``achieved more
convictions for civil rights violations than any previous
administration.''
   The president lauded Meese's anti-terrorism efforts, saying he
``worked closely with our allies to detect, apprehend and prosecute
those who wage war on innocent members of free societies.''
   Rangel, speaking for the Democrats, said Meese had failed Reagan
both as a friend and as the member of his Cabinet who should have
led a broad-based anti-drug effort.
   ``Mr. President, now that the attorney general has finally
resigned, I sincerely hope that you will take the initiative to
appoint someone that can restore the dignity and the integrity to
this great office that it deserves,'' Rangle said.
   The New York Democrat, who is chairman of a special House
committee on drugs, said one of Meese's failures was ``not putting
together the type of Cabinet team necessary to start the fight in
the war on drugs.''
   After enumerating what he said were other shortcomings of Meese,
Rangel said, ``Loyalty is one thing, but when you list those
failures of this personal friend, the attorney general, you cannot
overlook how he has failed to bring together this team to be
engaged in the war on drugs.''
   Reagan also spoke about the drug issues in his speech,
announcing that White House employes were told on Friday that
random drug testing will begin in 60 days.
   He also renewed his appeal to Democratic leaders in Congress to
appoint members to an executive-legislative drug task force,
recounting first lady Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign among
youth and saying, ``I figure if young people across the country can
come together against illegal drugs, then why shouldn't the
grownups in Washington be able to do the same?''
   ``If we are going to get the drugs out of schools, we need to
get the politics out of drugs,'' he said.
   ``I believe that partisan bickering or seeking political
advantage can only impede our progress in seeking to achieve a
drug-free America. I hope that the Democratic leaders in Congress
will now join in this united effort. The time for excuses and
delays is long past.''
   Reagan said May 16 in a speech to the graduating class of the
Coast Guard Academy that the national drug policy debate had become
too politicized. At the time, he called on Democratic and
Republican members of Congress to join the executive branch on a
task force to recommend solutions.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., named members of their chambers to
the task force some time ago.
   But House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Senate Majority
Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., have not named their members.

<HEAD>Report: Meese Gave Differing Accounts of Knowledge Of Alleged
Bribe Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III was ``closely
involved'' in discussions about a proposed $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline and gave conflicting accounts about whether he knew of an
alleged bribery scheme connected with the project, according to an
independent counsel's report.
   The sealed report, portions of which were obtained by The New
York Times, also calls ``highly unusual'' Meese's 1985 call to the
White House about the pipeline, and reveals that a sensitive memo
discussing financial guarantees for the project is missing from
Meese's files.
   The report makes no recommendation that Meese be prosecuted but
is said to raise numerous instances of questionable conduct and to
provide indications that Meese may have known about the plan to pay
off Israel's Labor Party to prevent Israel from attacking the
pipeline.
   Meese has previously said that his involvement in the pipeline
was ``limited'' and ``totally lawful.''
   The attorney general announced last week that he will step down
later this summer, saying the report by independent counsel James
McKay had ``vindicated'' him because it recommended no criminal
prosecution.
   In an interview aired Saturday, Meese said he couldn't comment
on the specifics of the document. He was asked about a National
Public Radio report that said that McKay concluded in another
aspect of his investigation that Meese could have been charged in
connection with his holdings of $14,000 in regional Bell stock.
   ``I think it's very unfair, quite frankly, for anyone to leak
information that is purportedly in a report that I can't even
comment on,'' Meese said on the Cable News Network show, ``Evans
and Novak.''
   McKay submitted the report last week to a three-judge federal
appeals court panel. Portions were also given to individuals
mentioned in it so they could make rebuttal comments before it is
made public.
   The Times published a story on the report in Saturday's editions
but did not identify its source. One source, speaking on condition
of anonymity, told The Associated Press that the portions obtained
by the newspaper were made available to E. Robert Wallach, Meese's
former lawyer and confidant. Executives of the Times have declined
comment.
   Wallach is awaiting trial in New York on a racketeering
indictment accusing him and two others of taking illegal payments
from Wedtech Corp., a Bronx, N.Y., defense contracting firm, to
influence Meese and other government officials.
   McKay issued a statement Friday saying he would ``seek sanctions
against the person or persons responsible'' for leaking material in
violation of a court order. His office refused to elaborate further
Saturday.
   Wallach did not returned a reporter's telephone calls. His
lawyer, George Walker, said by telephone Saturday from San
Francisco that he could not comment on the McKay report because it
was under seal.
   Walker said he did not know who leaked the report but added:
``If the order indicates that the document cannot be released, then
obviously McKay would have a right to request sanctions to anyone
who did that. Other than that, I don't want to speculate as to who
may or may not have done it.''
   According to the Times account, Meese was asked in November 1987
by McKay about his understanding of a memorandum from Wallach on
the pipeline, which was to take Iraqi oil to the Gulf of Aqaba.
   McKay asked whether Meese understood when he received the memo
in September 1985 that a portion of the pipeline funds would go
directly to the Labor Party.
   Meese replied that he couldn't ``recall specifically, but that
certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would
explain why Mr. (then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon) Peres was
personally interested.''
   However, two months later, Meese submitted a clarification of
his testimony, saying he didn't recall that part of the memo. The
clarification came a few weeks after news accounts reported that
the memo from Wallach to Meese mentioned planned payments to the
Labor Party, constituting a possible violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.
   Meese's lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap, said Meese had
been consistent in his statements about his knowledge of the plan
to make payments to the Israeli Labor Party. Lewin said Meese does
not recall reading the portion of the memo dealing with payments to
the political party and that is what Meese meant to say when he
gave the statement to McKay in November 1987.
   McKay determined that the memo was the only direct evidence of a
bribery plan and that the available evidence was therefore
insufficient to conclude Meese's activities violated the corrupt
practices act. Israeli officials were unavailable to be questioned
and several American witnesses invoked their right not to
incriminate themselves.
   McKay found that Meese was ``closely involved'' in 1985 in
discussions about building the pipeline. McKay said the project was
of limited interest to the U.S. government until Meese called
Robert McFarlane, then national security adviser, at the White
House to set up a meeting for Wallach and Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, one of the pipeline project's partners.
   ``It was highly unusual for a Cabinet officer to request Mr.
McFarlane to meet with the Cabinet officer's friend about a matter
of commercial interest to the friend,'' the report said.
   Before Meese's phone call, the pipeline project was being
monitored in a limited way by the National Security Council and
other U.S. agencies. Afterward, members of the NSC staff worked
diligently, sometimes outside normal government channels, to try
and get U.S. backing for the financial and security guarantees for
the pipeline, the Times quoted the report as saying.
   McKay also said a sensitive Justice Department memo to Meese
about the pipeline was missing from his files.
   The memo dealt with a financial option pertaining to possible
U.S. backing for the financial and security guarantees for the
pipeline, according to the report. The memo was written at
Wallach's urging by a department attorney, whom Wallach had
recommended that Meese hire for the position, and recommended a
possible solution to the legal problem, the Times reported.
   The pipeline project was never built. It was scuttled in 1986 by
McFarlane's successor, John Poindexter.

<HEAD>Stung By Schism, Vatican Moves Quickly To Recover Followers</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: SUBS 13th graf, `Lefebvre has...' to fix quote.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shaken by the first schism in the Roman Catholic
Church in more than a century, the Vatican has moved with unusual
speed to try to win back followers of renegade Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre.
   But it is showing no leniency for those who intend to follow the
82-year-old Frenchman, who consecrated four bishops without papal
approval June 30 and was excommunicated.
   Lefebvre contends the Vatican has broken with true Catholicism
by adopting Mass in languages other than Latin and by taking other
modernist steps.
   Within days of Lefebvre's defiant act, the Vatican firmly stated
that it would not tolerate Lefebvre sympathizers, but it made clear
that it hoped to persuade them to be loyal to the Roman Catholic
Church rather than follow Lefebvre out of it.
   It warned that excommunication awaited those who followed
Lefebvre and the bishops he consecrated, who also were
excommunicated. An excommunicated Catholic cannot participate in
the life and sacraments of the church.
   Pope John Paul II said Catholics would be committing ``a grave
offense to God'' by joining the archbishop and sympathizing with
the traditionalist views of his followers. The renegade movement
claims to have millions of sympathizers worldwide, but the Vatican
says only about 500,000 Catholics turn to Lefebvre's priests for
various church functions.
   In an attempt to win back Lefebvre's sympathizers, the pope
announced the Vatican would permit wider use of the 16th century
Latin Mass. Its suppression by the Second Vatican Council in the
1960s was challenged by Lefebvre and his supporters.
   John Paul also appointed a special commission to help meet the
``spiritual and liturgical'' needs of Lefebvre's followers, while
keeping them in the mainstream church.
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris acted on the pope's words
July 3, celebrating the Tridentine Mass in Latin at Notre Dame
Cathedral and announcing that Mass in Latin would be said in three
churches in Paris each Sunday.
   The Tridentine Mass was decreed by Pope Pius V in 1570 and is
used by Lefebvre and his sympathizers. In this Mass, unlike the
so-called New Mass that followed Vatican II, the priest has his
back to the congregation.
   ``If 12 years ago the church of Rome had allowed Lefebvre to
celebrate Mass in Latin, in the Pius V rite, surely today we
wouldn't have come to a schism,'' said Cardinal Silvio Oddi, a
conservative Italian prelate.
   But others view Lefebvre's differences with Rome as going well
beyond the Mass and reflecting the tensions in the church created
by the modernizing reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council.
   Lefebvre has accused the church of accepting ``modernism,
liberalism, communism, Sillonism,'' referring to a Roman Catholic
movement called ``Le Sillon'' that was condemned by Pope Pius X in
1910 for its modernist concepts. Lefebvre objects, among other
things, to the church's openness to other denominations and faiths.
The Second Vatican Council formally recognized that other faiths
have elements of truth and that their members stand in the love of
God.
   Lefebvre and his followers in the St. Pius X Fraternity see
Vatican II as generating the ``cancer of liberalism'' in the
church. Other groups have waved the flag of the council to
challenge Rome on issues ranging from papal authority to the ban on
women becoming priests.
   The Vatican had offered concessions to Lefebvre, but the
Frenchman reneged to assure what he called the ``survival of
tradition'' by his consecration of bishops. Church law allows only
bishops to perform ordinations so, Lefebvre says, his movement
would be ``orphaned'' unless he acted before dying.
   ``Those who worked very hard for an agreement are very
disappointed,'' said a senior Vatican official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The fact that the pope, a conservative himself, sought
reconciliation with the group ``could possibly encourage other
groups to push for independence in a different sort of way,'' said
the official.
   ``(Lefebvre) has opened the gates to many who would say the
progressives were right and the position of traditionalists in the
church will be weakened.''
   On the other hand, the schism has produced a wave of support for
John Paul, whose papacy now has been scarred by the first major
rupture in the church since the Old Catholics split from the
Vatican in 1870 to protest the dogma of papal infallibility decreed
by the First Vatican Council.
   Bishops from around the world have rallied around the pope,
stressing the need for unity in a church whose history has been
marked by division _ from the 11th century break with the patriarch
of Constantinople and his Orthodox church, to the excommunication
of Martin Luther, who led the Protestant Reformation in the 16th
century.

   As New Yorkers sweltered through temperatures in
the 90s last week, some of their favorite beaches were vacant _
except for a few men and women who picked through tidal debris.
   The beachcombers were not looking for shells. Syringes, blood
vials and other waste had washed up at Jones Beach, Robert Moses
State Park and other locations along 25 miles of Long Island shore.
The workers were enlisted to comb the closed beaches for additional
items of waste.
   Although at first the debris was thought to be hospital waste,
federal and state officials concluded on Friday the debris
resembled household and boating garbage. Most of the beaches were
reopened on Saturday.
   ``We don't believe this is a medical or hospital-type washup,''
William J. Muszynski, the deputy regional administrator of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, told The New York Times.
   He suggested that fears had been raised by the discovery of 145
vials of blood a few days earlier on the shore in industrial
Bayonne, N.J.; five of the vials were contaminated with the AIDS
virus. A month ago, five vials of blood were found farther south,
in Ocean County, N.J.
   The debris on the Long Island beaches focused attention on the
issue of medical-waste disposal, commonly called red-bag trash
because of the color of the bags in which it is put to distinguish
it from regular garbage.
   Those bags often contain lab waste, body parts, disposable
medical supplies, blood vials, needles, syringes, intravenous
tubing and any other material used to puncture the skin.
   A 500-bed hospital will spend an average of $120,000 annually to
a specially licensed carter to haul it away, said Kenneth Raske,
president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. Larger
hospitals which treat many AIDS patients often pay twice as much.
   Carters then must take the trash to high-tech incinerators
capable of burning the waste at temperatures of more than 2,000
degrees and up and pay anywhere from 50 cents to 90 cents a pound
to burn it.
   Most of these incinerators are far from the trash's point of
origin, some as far away as Pennsylvania, resulting in added
trucking costs.
   This, state environmentalist spokesman R.W. Groneman says, is an
invitation to the ``midnight dumper.'' Carters can either undercut
their competition or raise profits by promising to abide by the
law, then dumping the refuse at sea or on land.
   ``As we apply tighter and tighter standards on managing garbage,
we're also making it more costly and as a result we're getting a
lot of illegal dumping,'' said J. Winston Porter, EPA assistant
administrator of solid waste.
   Though the EPA has seen isolated incidents elsewhere, Porter
says it's ``nothing like what we've seen in New York and New
Jersey, which have very stringent laws concerning garbage.''
   In New York, all potentially infectious waste must be burned in
special incinerators. Outside of New York City, all other medical
waste can be buried in landfills. In New York City, however, all
medical waste must be burned.
   If medical trash is traced back to a particular hospital, they
face fines of up to $25,000, even if it was illegally dumped by the
carter.
   Though New Jersey laws are less definitive, a bill is currently
pending in that state's Legislature to monitor how hospitals and
haulers dispose of potentially infectious waste.
   Porter said environmental advocates have been pushing for a
national law committing red-bag haulers and facilities to a
``cradle-to-grave paper trail'' like the manifest system used in
hauling hazardous waste.
   Proponents argue it would stem illegal dumping, but Porter said
it would be inefficient to impose a nationwide law when it's
generally a two-state problem.

   The Iranian airliner shot
down a week ago was a victim of confusion that arises in modern
regional wars about the right of passage in battle zones.
   The problem led many airlines to shift routes away from the busy
Persian Gulf air corridors years ago. Some that still fly over the
gulf have altered their flight paths since a U.S. warship shot the
Iran Air Airbus down last Sunday, killing all 290 people aboard.
   Iran Air must continue flying over the gulf, but its planes are
taking routes that avoid the Strait of Hormuz, where missiles fired
by the cruiser USS Vincennes destroyed Flight 655.
   It left the military-civilian airport at Bandar Abbas on the
short flight to Dubai as the Vincennes and USS Elmer Montgomery
sank two Iranian attack boats and damaged another in a skirmish in
the narrow strait. U.S. officials said the Vincennes mistook the
Airbus A300 for an Iranian F-14 fighter.
   ``The particular problem is the commingling of civil traffic and
a war zone; when you put these two factors together, you're
creating a time bomb from the safety standpoint,'' said Hal Ewing,
a cargo pilot who flies the gulf.
   How civilian aircraft can avoid military confrontations was the
main topic at a weekend meeting of technical experts from six major
airlines operating passenger flights in the gulf region. It was
held at the International Air Transport Association headquarters in
Geneva.
   In their efforts to protect the sea lanes, naval vessels
sometimes disrupt those in the air.
   Charter pilots and journalists who monitor gulf radio traffic
say U.S. Navy vessels often urge aircraft to leave assigned flight
paths to avoid the warships, and declare no-go areas of up to
several miles for light aircraft.
   Last week, the Washington Post quoted a Dubai air controller as
saying one such order would have put two aircraft on a collision
course but that the jetliner told to alter its path ignored the
order.
   Ewing said the Navy has no legal right to order pilots off
courses assigned by air controllers. But he said if a military
vessel warned him to change course, ``I'm going to do what the
warship tells me to do. I have great respect for the air traffic
controllers, but the air traffic controllers don't control any
missiles. The warships do.''
   He added, however: ``For the most part, its is possible to go
out in the gulf and fly down the airways and not see any
(war)ships.''
   The cargo pilot noted that the Vincennes fired when the Iranian
airliner was only minutes away. Pentagon officials said the ship
detected military radar responses from the Airbus, but Iran denies
it carried a military transponder.
   ``They have a difficult mission,'' Ewing said of warships trying
to protect themselves and commercial shipping, but ``it's largely
incompatible with the needs of civil aviation transportion in the
region.''
   The Khaleej Times in Abu Dhabi said in an editorial Friday that
air traffic authorities ``should meet on an emergency basis and
work out a system that lessens the strain on pilots and the
possibility of error.''
   On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Daniel Howard blamed Iran for
the tragedy. He said the Iranian boats ``began the shooting.''
   It is not clear whether Iranian air officials were aware of the
battle in the strait below the airliner's flight path. Diplomats
and military observers say the speedboats sometimes appear to
operate under local command.
   The gulf, a transit point for flights from Europe and America to
Asia and Africa, is one of the world's busiest air traffic regions.
More than 4 million passengers used Dubai International Airport
last year.
   Flight 655 was following a route most international carriers
abandoned years ago because of the Iran-Iraq war, which began in
September 1980.
   Mansour Ahmadyan, deputy senior air traffic controller at Dubai,
said only Iran Air still uses the route.
   Most other airlines now avoid the war zone by flying up the gulf
around Iran or bypassing the tense Strait of Hormuz and approaching
Dubai across the horn of land occupied by Oman, he said.
   Iran Air did not announce a route change for flights from Bandar
Abbas to Dubai, but British journalist Robert Fisk was on the first
one after the Sunday flight. He said it took a circuitous route and
approached Dubai from the west.

   The expansion of U.S. Naval power in the
Persian Gulf has failed to curtail attacks on merchant shipping or
to promote negotiations to end the bloody eight-year war between
Iran and Iraq.
   Leading members of Congress are restive, their concern
heightened by the U.S. destruction of an Iranian commercial
jetliner last Sunday that killed all 290 people aboard.
   ``The United States has unilaterally assumed the role of
policeman in the Persian Gulf,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``Our naval
forces are protecting shipping in some of the world's most
congested waterways, and under heavily trafficked skies.''
   The Soviet Union, after initially calling the disaster an ``act
of murder,'' toned down its rhetoric but renewed its demand for the
immediate withdrawal of the 18 U.S. ships that now patrol the Gulf,
with license to open fire on Iranian planes and helicopters that
threaten 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers or any other neutral shipping.
   A number of Arab countries normally hostile to Iran have
condemned the downing of the plane despite U.S. assurances that it
was an accident.
   President Reagan has persisted in defining as his main aim in
the gulf protecting ``the right of navigation in international
waters,'' and his policy has the support of a number of allies and
prominent Americans.
   ``I happen to think it's correct,'' said Zbigniew Brzezinski,
who was President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. ``It's
designed to keep the Russians out and to keep the Iranians from
winning. That's the purpose of the policy and that has not been
altered by the tragedy.''
   The 18 U.S. ships keeping an eye on the 7.7 million barrels a
day of oil that pass through the tense Strait of Hormuz are backed
up by the carrier Forrestal and seven other American vessels,
including the cruiser Vincennes, which shot down the Iranian Airbus.
   The Navy has fired on Iranian helicopters and destroyed oil
installations and been the victim of collisions with mines and a
tragedy second in scope only to the Airbus disaster: the May 17,
1987, misdirected attack by an Iraqi war plane that killed 37
American sailors aboard the U.S. frigate Stark.
   Ironically, the U.S. Navy's presence tilts in Iraq's favor even
though the Reagan administration's stated policy is one of
neutrality between the gulf combatants. By protecting the Kuwaiti
and other merchant ships, the United States seeks to curb Iran's
ability to conduct a ``tanker war'' as a pressure tactic against
Iraq and its Arab allies.
   In the meantime, Tehran has not bowed to U.S. demands that it
enter negotiations and attacks on ships in the volatile gulf region
have increased.
   According to the Center for Defense Information, a private
research group, there have been 184 attacks on commercial vessels
in the area since last July 22, when the first convoy of Kuwaiti
tankers carrying U.S. flags moved through the gulf. Iran carried
out 104 of the attacks and Iraq 80, Brian McCarten of the Center
said.
   Over the same period a year earlier, there were 115 attacks: 52
by the Iranians and 63 by the Iraqis.
   Sen. Pell urged consideration of a U.N. naval peace-keeping
force to protect nonbelligerent shipping in the gulf. ``It could
enhance gulf security while reducing risk of future tragedies,''
Pell said.
   The proposal has the endorsement of Cyrus R. Vance, secretary of
state in the Carter administration, and Elliot Richardson, a former
undersecretary.
   Another former undersecretary of state, George W. Ball called
the reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers an example of ``the vice of
unilateralism'' and said the Reagan administration should have
accepted a Soviet proposal for a U.N. naval forces.
   The proposal was rejected ``and now we see the consequences of
that,'' Ball said by telephone from Princeton, N.J.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., a member of the Foreign Relations
committee, suggested a varied approach. He said in an interview
Friday U.S. ships should protect American merchant vessels, British
warships protect their nation's cargoes, and so on.
   ``What we've had is a great escalation, and we only get 10
percent of our oil from the gulf, and a tilt toward Iraq,'' Adams
said.
   With the U.S. Navy admittedly in a combat zone, Adams said, the
Reagan administration should formally invoke the War Powers Act
giving Congress the power to decide whether the warships should
remain there.
   This concern was clearly heightened by the downing of the
Iranian jetliner. But even last November, the staff of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee warned: ``The United States seriously
risks being drawn into war in the Persian Gulf. Although the stated
purpose of the large American fleet in the region is narrowly
defined _ to escort U.S.-flagged vessels through the gulf _ this
mission, given the circumstances, is dangerously nebulous.''
   On the diplomatic front, a year ago Secretary of State George P.
Shultz led a successful drive in the United Nations Security
Council for adoption of a cease-fire resolution.
   But he has failed to persuade the Soviet Union or China to
promise not to use their veto powers to block a follow-up
resolution to impose an arms embargo against Iran for refusing to
negotiate with Iraq.
   As a result, the cease-fire resolution is an empty statement of
principle.
   Iran has sent a number of ``probes'' to the administration, and
in the wake of last Sunday's disaster the White House and State
Department revealed American entreaties to Tehran to talk about
ending the war and freeing the nine American hostages in Lebanon
held by pro-Iranian forces.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, said the United States should now take advantage of
whatever diplomatic opportunities the situation may present.
``Ironically, this is the kind of event that may offer some
possibilities for a push toward settlement,'' he said on CNN's
``Newsmaker Saturday'' program.
   Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Larijani sent a
message last April through U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar expressing hopes for a meeting. But the State Department
was unable to confirm that the probes were ``authoritative'' and
had the support of the entire Iranian government.
   Reagan's message last Sunday of ``deep regret'' contained an
offer to work jointly to end the war. So far, Tehran has not
replied.

   Actress Brigitte Nielsen and New York Jets'
defensive lineman Mark Gastineau have split up but they can't leave
behind one memento of their 6-month engagement.
   They each have a tattoo of the other's name on their bottoms.
   Ms. Nielsen and Gastineau called it quits because their career
demands made a ``stable and long-lasting relationship'' impossible,
said her publicist, Joel Brokaw.
   The couple announced their engagement last February and said in
May that they were expecting a baby this fall.
   But Ms. Nielsen, 25, suffered a miscarriage while filming a
movie in Rome. She is divorced from her second husband, Sylvester
Stallone.
   A divorce between the 31-year-old Gastineau and his wife, Lisa,
is pending.

following a minor car accident, Buckingham Palace said Saturday.
   ``There are no problems. She is OK,'' said a palace spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   The 28-year-old duchess, formerly Sarah Ferguson, is married to
Prince Andrew the Duke of York, second son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Friday's accident occurred on a section of the M40, a busy
western highway into London, part of which was closed for repairs,
Thames Valley police said.
   A police bodyguard was driving the duchess's Jaguar. Police said
the duchess's car received a punctured front tire and other slight
damage. She continued the journey in an accompanying police car.

   Real estate developer Donald Trump is branching
out into the sport of boxing.
   Trump told The New York Times that he's agreed to act as
business and boxing manager for heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
   ``I like the concept because I like Mike Tyson,'' Trump said.
``Also because it's so different from what I've done before.''
   Trump, the hotel and casino owner who bankrolled Tyson's
successful title defense June 27 against Michael Spinks in Atlantic
City, N.J., said Tyson had asked him to act as his career adviser
and help him with lawsuits against his current manager, Bill Cayton.
   Tyson is suing Cayton in an attempt to void contracts under
which Cayton received one-third of all of Tyson's boxing earnings.
Tyson received a little less than $21 million for the Spinks fight
alone.
   Although Trump would not disclose details, he said he would be
paid a substantial fee, which he would donate to various charities.
Trump said he would hire a boxing expert to help with decisions
concerning future opponents.

   Renowned attorney Melvin Belli and Wheldone
Rumproast IV have been reunited.
   Belli, 80, went to court last week to gain custody of ``Rumpy''
from his estranged wife, Lia Belli. The publicly feuding Bellis are
in the process of ending their 16-year marriage.
   On Friday, Mrs. Belli delivered the Italian greyhound to Belli's
yacht, ending a dogfight that began a week ago when Belli went
through the Bellis' $6 million mansion to clear out his belongings.
He took his three other dogs, but Mrs. Belli insisted on keeping
Rumpy as a watchdog.
   ``She (Lia) doesn't like the dog and the dog doesn't like her,''
her husband responded. He complained that Mrs. Belli was making
Rumpy sleep alone on the mansion's cold stone basement floor.
   Mrs. Belli, 39, issued a statement Friday explaining that she
sent Rumpy packing because ``Mel's ranting and raving has gotten so
ridiculous.''

   Computer whiz Steve Wozniak, whose
divorce was finalized this month, is suing his former wife for
slander following the exchange of numerous bitter accusations
between the couple.
   Wozniak, 37, co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., seeks
unspecified damages from Candi Wozniak and her sister, Diddo Clark,
in the lawsuit filed Friday in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
   He complains in the suit that his former wife's widely reported
allegations about his behavior on two occasions accused him of
``committing the crime of assault and battery'' and of ``being an
unfit father and one who had treated his own baby son with a
callous disregard.''
   ``I don't know why he hates so much, but that's what it sounds
like,'' Mrs. Wozniak said after the suit was filed. ``Maybe it's
guilt because he left his pregnant wife.''
   Divorce papers in the couple's seven-year marriage were
finalized earlier in the week, although custody and property
arrangements have still to be worked out, according to Candi
Wozniak.
   Weeks after Wozniak filed for divorce in April 1987, his wife
announced that she was pregnant with their third child. One of the
issues in their break-up was that he wanted more children.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines union leaders say a new safety
agreement with the carrier could be a sign of progress, but add
that tense labor-management relations will improve more if the high
number of firings and suspensions is reduced.
   ``We've had five terminations this week, so nothing has
abated,'' said Nancy Currier, a vice president of the Transport
Workers Union local representing 7,000 flight attendants. The rate
of firings ``is far higher than it was last year, and far higher
than it was before (Frank) Lorenzo.
   ``It would be one of the most meaningful areas for improvement.''
   Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp. took over Eastern more than two years
ago, inheriting some $2.5 billion in debts and a recent history of
labor-management conflict.
   At the district office of the Machinists union, Eastern's
largest with 12,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp workers,
union officials keep detailed charts tracing the steady rise of
disciplinary measures, particularly firings, since the takeover.
   ``Our big concern is the unjust terminations. Lorenzo talks
about mending fences, but I don't think the word has filtered down
to his front-line management, who keep burning bridges,'' said Rick
Iacino, a Machinists general chairman.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Eastern wouldn't comment on
the safety agreement announced Wednesday in Washington beyond a
statement from President Phil Bakes.
   While Bakes praised the agreement as important to separating
safety from other issues, he said a ``missing link'' remains until
contract negotiations are completed with the Machinists, who have
been in federal mediation for seven months, and the pilots, with
whom talks started about a month ago.
   Former Labor Secretary William Brock, who brought the two sides
together in Washington, said battling between Eastern management
and its union leadership threatens the carrier's survival.
   ``It is the commitment of labor and management leaders which
will make or break this effort,'' Brock said. ``Frankly, this
presents some cause for concern.''
   ``All observers have said when looking at this that they've
never seen anything this severe and such shrill treatment between
management and labor _ maybe going back to the '40s and the coal
miners,'' said veteran Machinists leader Charles E. Bryan.
   The agreement calls for more outside, impartial scrutiny,
increased communications between labor and management, and promises
no reprisals against employees who point out safety problems.
   The Machinists claim that employees who balked at hurry-up work
have been disciplined; in addition, workers have been fired for
insubordination, refusing to work excessive overtime or for union
activities.
   The Machinists union has had 41 shop stewards fired in the last
two years. This year, 129 Machinists have been fired so far,
compared to 157 in the first six months of 1987, the union says.
   The Machinists say they have fared well in grievances, winning
back pay and reinstatement in a majority of cases. But the
grievance procedures are backlogged more than a year, they say.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, representing 3,500 Eastern
pilots, has had a different problem: many of its pilots have gone
to other airlines or left the industry entirely because of
Eastern's tense situation and uncertain future.
   Pilots spokesman J.B. Stokes said nearly 1,000 pilots will have
left Eastern since 1986 by the end of this summer, according to
projections.
   ``You're talking about 25 percent. Without the pilots, these
planes are taco stands,'' Stokes said.
   Pilots last year launched a MaxSafety program in which they
highlighted alleged safety laxity and took their complaints into
congressional hearings.
   Eastern has said toughened absenteeism policies and increased
discipline are part of efforts to correct years of worker abuses
that have driven up costs. Management has indicated it still
believes cuts in labor costs are essential.
   This spring, federal officials conducted special inspections of
aircraft flown by Eastern and Continental Airlines, another Texas
Air subsidiary. They also examined Texas Air's management and
finances.
   They said that they found no unsafe conditions but warned of
possible safety problems because of the labor-management battles.

   Here is the text of the weekly Democratic
response to President Reagan's radio address, given by Rep. Charles
B. Rangel, D-N.Y.
   I'm Representative Charles Rangel, Chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotic Abuse and Control.
   Mr. President, now that Ed Meese has finally resigned as acting
attorney general, you now have the opportunity to appoint a person
that can restore the dignity and integrity that the office
rightfully deserves.
   Ed Meese not only let you down as a personal friend, Mr.
President, but when you made him your personal coordinator in the
war against drugs, there was no strategy, there was no policy. In
short, there was no war.
   You appointed Ed Meese to head up your Drug Policy Abuse Board
composed of your highest ranking Cabinet officials. And yet, Mr.
President, he let us down. With every major drug-producing country
having bumper crops year after year, Mr. Meese has never been able
to persuade our Secretary of State to even place drugs on our
foreign policy agenda.
   On the Middle East, communism, terrorism, arm controls _ we've
all heard the eloquence of our outspoken secretary of state. But
even today, we've yet to hear one word from Secretary of State
George Shultz on narcotics control, as we see drug-traffickers
assassinate international leaders, plunder and corrupt governments,
and even hold fragile democracies in our own hemisphere hostage.
   Even when you, Mr. President, admitted that narcotic abuse and
trafficking was a threat to our national security, it wasn't enough
to get former Secretary of Defense Weinberger or now Secretary
Carlucci to pitch in and lend their support with the multi-trillion
dollar technology we've invested in our military to back up and to
support our Border Patrol, our Coast Guard, and Customs officials.
   Surely Mr. President, the protection of our borders and shores
against the intrusion of this deadly epidemic-causing poison
warrants the support of our sophisticated military leadership. Mr.
President, Mr. Meese and your Drug Policy Board has never been able
to get Secretary Bennett _ Secretary of Education Bennett _ to get
beyond ``just saying no.'' ``No'' to preventive program, ``no'' to
educational programs, and even ``no'' to our local and state
governments as we try to give assistance to formulate their own
programs.
   Today we have no health programs designed for drug abusers from
the secretary of Health and Human Services. We don't have any
health policy that encourages research and treatment modalities to
share with private and public health providers. And throughout
these great United States in this possession, we don't even have
one federal rehabilitation center to serve as a model for our
nation.
   As Mr. Meese was conducting a war against drugs, Mr. President,
he certainly needed more than a Drug Enforcement Agency that
although these are hard-working, dedicated agents that we only have
2,800 agents to cover the entire United States and the foreign
countries that allow their presence.
   Mr. President, the local and state law enforcement officials
know that the federal government can't do this job alone. They have
been in the trenches for nearly eight years, outnumbered, outarmed,
but always on the job. But they've never been invited as full-time
partners in this so-called war against drugs.
   Every budget that has been projected by the Congress to provide
for federal assistance to these dedicated officials have been
rejected or resisted by you, Mr. President, your Office of
Management and Budget, and yes, your attorney general. Now Mr.
President, even after seven-and-a-half years, we can start anew.
   You can now appoint an attorney general that will work with the
Congress and to help us to prepare legislation that can truly make
a national war against drugs, and that can make all Americans
proud. The ever-mounting increase of narcotics that's entering our
classrooms and even our boardrooms indicate that this is not a
local issue, and certainly it can't be considered a Democratic or
Republican issue.
   Let us know, Mr. President, now that as late as it is, we can
appoint an attorney general that will work with Speaker Jim Wright
and his bipartisan House legislative team headed by Democratic
Majority Leader Tom Foley, and Republican Minority Leader Bob
Michels that can fashion a bill and a policy that makes some sense.
For those of us that are faint at heart and who believe that we can
win this war by legalizing drugs, let them be on notice, Mr.
President, that this battle can and shall be won. We can't do it
just by slogans.
   We can't do it by throwing up our hands in frustration and
despair, but we can begin to get started by stop blaming each other
and coming together and working together in a joint effort. With
your new attorney general we can start a new relationship. The
Congress can't do this job alone. It's not too late for us together
to provide the resources, the programs, but most of all, Mr.
President, the leadership to get the job done.
   Thank you.

   The Communist Party restored Nikolai I. Bukharin's
membership Saturday, completing the rehabilitation of Lenin's old
comrade 50 years after Josef Stalin had him shot as a spy for
opposing the dictator's policies.
   Retrieving Bukharin's memory from disgrace is part of the effort
by Mikhail S. Gorbachev to clear the names of dozens of people who
became Stalin's victims after helping lead the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution and form the Soviet state.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the Party Control Committee
of the policy-making Central Committee readmitted Bukharin, another
old Bolshevik, Alexei I. Rykov, and 14 other people.
   Millions of Soviet citizens heard the announcement on state
television's evening news program.
   The rehabilitations began Feb. 4, when the Supreme Court cleared
Bukharin and the others of the charges for which they were executed
or imprisoned. Many articles examining Bukharin and his policies
have appeared in the Soviet press.
   In Bukharin's case, rehabilitation has special significance
because it implies endorsement of his opposition to the harsh
policies with which Stalin forced the industrialization of the
Soviet Union and the collectivization of agriculture.
   It answers an emotional plea he made for rehabilitation before
he was shot in 1938. In it, he said: `Know, comrades, that on the
banner which you will carry in your victorious march to communism,
there is a drop of my blood.''
   Bukharin also incurred Stalin's displeasure by advocating a
greater role for voluntary work cooperatives, more individual
enterprise and other policies resembling reforms Gorbachev has
promoted.
   Gorbachev noted in a speech Nov. 2, however, that Lenin regarded
Bukharin as not ``fully Marxist'' and said rapid develolpment of
Soviet industry and agriculture had been necessary.
   Saturday's announcement praised Bukharin and Rykov for helping
build communism. It said they took ``dissenting positions in the
determination of courses and methods of socialist construction''
but added that the ``mistakes and dissenting positions are not of
an anti-party character.''
   Since gaining power in March 1985, Gorbachev has attacked Stalin
for his ``cult of personality,'' tried to dismantle much of the
central bureaucratic structure Stalin built and acknowledged that
innocent people suffered under the dictator's terror.
   In the November speech, he announced a resumption of the effort
begun by Nikita S. Khrushchev 30 years ago to rehabilitate the
millions of victims.
   He told the Communist Party conference July 1, in a reference to
Stalin's purges, that it is important to ``restore justice with
regard to the victims of lawlessness'' and it is the party's
``political and moral duty'' to do so. He endorsed building a
monument to Stalin's victims in Moscow.
   Tass said the Control Committee restored the party memberships
June 21, but the agency did not explain why the action was not
announced for more than two weeks.
   Bukharin, Rykov and Stalin were allies in 1926, two years after
Lenin's death, in the power struggle with Leon Trotsky.
   Two years later, with Stalin firmly in control, Bukharin and
Rykov were branded leaders of a ``rightist deviation'' in the party
and Bukharin was labeled a ``falsifier of Marxism.'' They were
stripped of their party posts in the ensuing years.
   On June 13, the Soviet Supreme Court reversed the convictions of
three other Bolsheviks who perished under Stalin: Lev Kamenev,
Gregory Zinoviev and Karl Radek.
   Trotsky has not been rehabilitated.
   He was accused of leading an anti-Soviet plot and murdered in
Mexico City in 1940, apparently on Stalin's orders. On June 17,
Soviet historian Yuri N. Afanasyev suggested Trotsky be exonerated
of criminal charges and his writings be published in the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports 2,000 More Cuban Troops In Angola</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Portuguese newspaper reported Saturday
that 2,000 Cuban troops have been sent to Angola to bolster
government defenses near the border with Namibia.
   The independent weekly Expresso quoted unidentified reliable
sources as saying the Cubans, described as experts in mounting and
firing missiles, landed in the former Portuguese colony in June.
   The newspaper said the reinforcements were sent to strengthen
the position of the Marxist Angolan government and Cuba in
negotiations with South Africa and the United States to end the
13-year civil war in Angola.
   The reinforcements arrived shortly before a second round of
peace negotiations between the four countries in Cairo, Egypt, the
newspaper said. Lower level delegations scheduled more talks Monday
and Tuesday in New York.
   In a separate story, Expresso quoted unidentified diplomatic
sources in Havana as saying Cuban forces had mounted a defensive
line involving 26,000 men in the south of Angola, close to South
African-administered Namibia, also known as South-West Africa.
   Angola and Cuba have acknowledged that Cuba began sending
reinforcements of elite troops to Angola in November to help the
35,000 Cuban soldiers already stationed there contain South African
advances in the south.
   Western analysts believe those reinforcements brought the number
of Cubans in Angola to about 46,000.
   Expresso claimed the Cuban reinforcements were creating
differences between the Angolan government and Cuba.
   Last week, Jorge Risquet, the chief Cuban negotiator at the
peace talks, strongly denied any rift. He told a news conference in
Lisbon all military decisions were made by the Angolan government.
   South African troops in Angola support guerrillas of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, also backed by
the United States, who have been fighting since 1975 to force the
Soviet- and Cuban-supported government to share power.
   A peace settlement turns on securing a withdrawal of foreign
troops from Angola and implementing a U.N. resolution to make
Namibia independent.

   The death toll from a weeklong heat wave
rose to 56 Saturday, officials said. Forest fires blamed in part on
the heat raged across Greece and killed four people, including
three British tourists.
   Temperatures topped 104 degrees Saturday in Athens and hit 109
degrees in the northern Greek city of Larissa, the National Weather
Service said.
   The National Center for Emergency Aid said more than 3,600
people have been admitted to hospitals, and hospital officials
reported 25 more heat-related deaths Saturday.
   ``In the past 24 hours, we've had six heat-related deaths in
Athens,'' said a center spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Nineteen other deaths were reported in other parts of
the country.
   On the western resort island of Cephalonia, a forest fire burned
out of control for a second day, leaving four people dead,
including a woman from London and her two daughters, police said.
   Irene Evans, 32, and daughters Jenny, 10, and Maria, 3, died of
burns Friday after the fire broke out near the village of Lakithra,
said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A 82-year-old Greek woman, Eleni Konstantatou, also died in the
blaze and eight people were injured, the spokesman said.
   ``The fire's now burning on five fronts and has destroyed
thousands of acres of pine forest and olive orchards,'' the
spokesman said.
   Other fires broke out across central and southern Greece and on
the islands of Corfu and Chios, forestry officials said.
   Blistering temperatures sent thousands of Athenians fleeing to
beaches surrounding the capital. Several hundred people camped in
an air-conditioned stadium in Athens' port of Piraeus to escape the
heat.
   The weather service predicted temperatures would fall into the
90s Sunday.
   ``Our forecasts show that from tomorrow we'll have normal
temperatures for this time of year and we'll be able to forget this
nightmare,'' a weather bureau spokesman said.

<HEAD>Lockheed Closing Plant Opened in Wake of 1965 Watts Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The closing of a Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
plant will end one of the few successful efforts by a major
employer to create jobs in the impoverished Watts neighborhood
following the 1965 riots.
   The Watts-Willowbrook plant, which makes parts for the C-5 cargo
plane, will close by October when work on the C-5 is completed, the
company said Friday. The plant is on the city's south side, about 8
miles from downtown.
   Of the plant's 117 workers, 78 have enough seniority to qualify
for transfers to the company's Burbank plant, about 20 miles away.
Lockheed said it will attempt to find employment for the rest with
other aerospace firms.
   A Lockheed spokesman said the company had expected to use the
plant for other work after the completion of the C-5 program, but
Lockheed's aircraft business has been dwindling and no suitable
projects could be found.
   ``We had hoped that Lockheed would be able to feed more work to
Watts-Willowbrook,'' said Mark Molli, an aide to U.S. Rep. Augustus
F. Hawkins, D-Calif. ``We want to see that the workers are taken
care of.''
   Former Lockheed President A. Carl Kotchian recalled in a recent
interview that the company's decision to open the plant four years
after the devastating riot was considered controversial.
   ``I had my own people take issue with me,'' Kotchian said.
``They said I was going to spend a lot of money and the place was
going to be run down and there was going to be thievery and
muggings at the plant. None of it came to pass.''
   Instead, the plant matched the productivity and efficiency of
most Lockheed factories, he said.
   The arrest of a black man by a state highway patrol officer on
Aug. 11, 1965, touched off a week of rioting that turned Watts into
a national symbol of racial strife.
   Thirty-four people died in the riot and 4,000 people were
arrested. Damage from the six days of looting, fires and shooting
reached $40 million.
   DV Industries, a smaller aerospace company that has operated in
Watts for 30 years, plans to take over Lockheed's 25-year lease on
the factory, which is owned by Economic Resources Corp., a
non-profit group formed after the riot.
   The company expects to double its 55-person work force over the
next year and will give hiring preference to former Lockheed
workers, said Carl La Barbera, DV's executive vice president.
   DV Industries, a privately held company with sales under $10
million per year, inspects and paints aircraft parts for Lockheed,
Boeing and other aerospace firms.

<HEAD>Strong Opposition Showing Marks End of PRI Monopoly, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition's strong showing in
presidential elections marks a watershed in Mexican politics _ a
transition from 59 years of a one-party system and the awakening of
a long passive electorate, political analysts say.
   Early returns indicated that Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, would
finish with no more than 52 percent of the vote, party officials
say. That is far below the 70 percent the party had considered the
minimum.
   The PRI has not lost a presidential, gubernatorial or senate
race since it was founded in 1929. Partial returns have shown
Salinas leading with 47.8 percent of the vote.
   PRI officials appeared willing to concede that Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas of the leftist National Democratic Front and Manuel J.
Clouthier of the conservative National Action Party would finish
better than original polls indicated.
   PRI sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, conceded
Salinas had likely lost in Michoacan, the Federal District, and
adjoining Morelos state and probably in the state of Mexico. The
Mexico City metropolitan area accounts for about 20 percent of the
38 million registered voters.
   Cardenas' and Clouthier's parties said Salinas lost, and they
claimed widespread fraud.
   The voter turnout and final results were not expected until
Sunday, but partial results were leaked in an attempt to defuse
allegations of manipulation of the vote.
   Salinas insisted on a small but credible margin of victory
rather than the frequently fraud-tainted results the party is known
for. But the almost certain loss of congressional seats and the
opposition entry into the Senate for the first time is hard for the
party's old guard.
   ``Psychologically, it means a big blow,'' Adolfo Aguilar, a
Mexican economist with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, said.
``Politically, just imagine the slice of people they have to cut.
This chunk of votes means many PRI candidates. It's going to be
disastrous for the PRI.''
   Political analyst Jorge Castaneda said Cardenas did much better
than expected, particularly in urban areas.
   Salinas, who has said he wants to modernize Mexico, will owe his
vote ``to the poorest, most backward peasantry of the country,''
Castaneda said.
   In a victory proclamation before any results were released,
Salinas acknowledged the opposition would have more congressional
representation than in the past and said, ``The times of virtually
having a single party are over, and we now enter a new political
stage in the country's life, with a majority party and a very
intense competition by the opposition.''
   Clear-cut opposition from both the left, united for the first
time, and the right swept away decades of apathy, and voters turned
out in what officials say were record numbers.
   ``Young people turned out not just to vote but also as polling
place officials to protect the cleanliness of the election,'' Jorge
Bustamente, director of the Northern Border College in Tijuana,
said.
   ``The country is changing ... very broad sectors went to vote
even though they knew'' there would be the traditional fraud,
something that kept them away in the past, Luis Javier Garrido, a
political analyst who wrote a book on the PRI, said. ``They went to
vote for another system.''
   Lorenzo Meyer, academic director of the Colegio de Mexico, a
think tank and graduate school, said the change was long in coming.
   ``From 1940 to 1988 you can't see many political changes,'' he
said. But in the same half century, Mexico evolved from a sparsely
inhabited rural country whose people had little education to a
fast-growing urban nation with schools and well developed
communications.
   A PRI official says the answer in the Salinas administration
will be to ``play by clean rules, and on economic issues you
deliver.''
   Castaneda, reflecting a view expressed by others, said the
election ``means the end of the one-party system and also the end
of a situation where the government could do what it wanted.''
   But Garrido said he believed the PRI's assurance of a majority
in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate would keep the opposition
from influencing the government and still allow Salinas to carry
out his programs.
   ``I don't think it necessarily means more pluralism,'' he said.
He said that would come when there is the opposition's ``same right
to govern is recognized.''
   Others interviewed said Salinas would have to take the
opposition into consideration and negotiate.
   Much also will depend on the credibility of the final election
tally and the elections themselves.
   A critical factor will be whether the long-splintered left's
fragile unity for the campaign continues after the election.
Cardenas has emerged as the leader the left lacked.
   ``It's him or nobody,'' Meyer said, but he warned,
``consolidating it (the left) in a party is a formidable task.''

<HEAD>Pope Appoints Commission For Lefebvre</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Vatican-Lefebvre, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday appointed an
eight-member commission to seek ways to persuade followers of
excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre to remain loyal to the
Roman Catholic Church.
   The pope warned on July 2 that Lefebvre sympathizers will be
excommunicated if they remain with the rebel prelate. But John Paul
also promised to try to meet their traditionalist needs _ including
Mass said in Latin _ if they follow the pope.
   Lefebvre created the first church schism in 118 years when he
consecrated four traditionalist bishops on June 30 without papal
permission. The act caused the automatic excommunication of the
five, as well as of Monsignor Antonio de Castro Mayer, a Brazilian
prelate who assisted Lefebvre in the ceremony.
   John Paul said the special Vatican commission will seek to
preserve the ``spiritual and liturgical traditions'' of Lefebvre
followers, such as the 16th century Tridentine Mass in Latin.
   Lefebvre and his followers reject many modernizing reforms of
the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, including the replacement of
the Latin Mass with a simplified liturgy in the local language.
   The 82-year-old French prelate's defiant act has produced the
first major rupture in the church since the Old Catholics split
from the Vatican in 1870 to protest the dogma of papal
infallibility decreed by the First Vatican Council.
   The commission will be headed by West German Cardinal Paul
Augustin Mayer, who until recently was prefect of the Vatican's
Congregation for the Sacraments and of the Congregation for the
Divine Cult.
   Other commission members are Monsignor Tere Tena Garriga,
undersecretary of the Congregation for the Divine Cult; Monsignor
Milan Simcic of the Congregation for the Clergy; Monsignor Jesus
Torres Llorente of the Congregation for the Religious; Tarcisio
Bertone, an expert in canon law; Monsignor Frantisek Rypar of the
Congregation for Catholic Education; Benedictine theologian Benoit
Duroux; Don Fernando Ocariz for the Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith.

<BYLINE>Changes In Robeson County: Are They Real Or Cosmetic?
^By ERICA JOHNSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five months after two American Indians took
hostages at a newspaper to protest local conditions, changes have
been made to address their concerns, but some say it remains to be
seen whether the reforms will bring lasting change.
   Others say the real change is that residents of Robeson County
have realized ``that they can control their lives.''
   ``It's truly cosmetic,'' Eddie Hatcher said last week of the
changes, which include a second superior court judgeship and a task
force named by Gov. Jim Martin to investigate alleged corruption in
the county.
   ``It's nothing more than to douse the fire, hoping it will go
out,'' said Hatcher, one of two Lumbee Indian men who entered the
offices of The Robesonian newspaper Feb. 1, allegedly armed, in
what they said was a protest of local corruption and discrimination
against minorities. The daylong siege ended when the governor
agreed to appoint the task force.
   The county's population of about 100,000 is 37 percent Indian,
37 percent white and 26 percent black.
   The Rev. Mac Legerton, executive director of the Center for
Community Action, also was cautious.
   ``The policy changes which have occurred relate to the
administration of the law,'' he said. ``Hopefully, these changes
will provide better treatment under the law. But they will not
ensure justice throughout Robeson County.''
   Other residents were more optimistic.
   ``From my point of view, we got the second judgeship, and we're
going to get a public defender,'' said Harvey Godwin, a Lumbee
community leader who led Julian Pierce's campaign for superior
court judge.
   ``That's pretty good,'' Godwin said. ``But we're making sure
that people don't forget and don't let up. We're taking care of
business.''
   Pierce, a Lumbee who was running against District Attorney Joe
Freeman Britt for Robeson County's superior court judgeship, was
shot to death in March in what initially was called an
assassination but was later termed a domestic dispute. That left
the post to Britt, who has sent more people to death row than any
other prosecutor in the nation.
   After it became apparent that the judgeship would go to Britt,
the state agreed to create a second judgeship, which would go to a
member of a minority group.
   Hatcher said the second judgeship ``was just to appease the
people of Robeson County, hoping that the people will die down.''
   Because Britt is expected to be the county's senior judge, he
``will be able to set the (judicial) calendar, pick a magistrate,
and set the bail-bond policy,'' Hatcher said. ``What have we
gained? Nothing.''
   But Hatcher said real change has come in the minds of Lumbee
Indians and blacks.
   ``The people have seen changes in themselves because they have
realized that they can control their lives,'' he said.
   ``Now it's not just me and (fellow accused hostage-taker Timothy
Jacobs) speaking out,'' Hatcher said. ``Now it's the poor farmer,
it's the grass-roots people. They're realizing they can do
something. They're unaccustomed to politically fighting back. But
they're beginning to.''
   He cited a referendum vote to unite the county's five-school
system that passed by a razor-thin margin this spring. Supporters
say it will lessen economic and educational disparities among
schools in the system and foster a sense of common purpose.
   Godwin agreed that many people in Robeson County who previously
have felt powerless now feel differently.
   ``People are angry, but the point is, they realize that they can
do something about it,'' he said. ``I think people are going to
take advantage of that, especially the younger people.''
   ``It used to be we were just lost,'' said Georgeanna Chavis, 66.
``Now, it seems that we are coming out.''
   Mrs. Chavis also said she thought whites have treated her better
in recent months.
   ``Maybe they feel that we're trying to pull ourselves out of
where we were,'' she said. ``It's like white people are saying `We
don't see why they waited so long.'''
   Would those changes have come about without the protest Hatcher
and Jacobs staged?
   ``I think they certainly can be given credit,'' said the Rev.
Joy Johnson, a leader of Concerned Citizens and vice-chairman of
the county's human-relations commission. ``We don't approve of
their means. But I think they gave us the impetus for change in
Robeson County.''

   The former chief attorney of the U.S.
Postal Service for the Western region has been charged with four
counts of battery or abusive sexual contact against female
employees.
   Lyman Johnston, 62, a 21-year employee of the Postal Service,
was indicted by a federal grand jury on four charges, two of them
felonies, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said Friday. The maximum
punishment is nine years in prison.
   All of the incidents took place at the regional headquarters in
San Bruno, south of San Francisco, between June 1985 and last
December, the grand jury said.
   Johnston, whose title was regional counsel, was notified in
February that he would be removed from his job, but was allowed to
retire voluntarily in April, Russoniello said.

   A runaway car jumped a sidewalk and
struck and killed three young children as they played in front of a
house, police and witnesses said.
   The children died after they were taken to two hospitals after
the accident Friday night. Killed were Jason Northrup, 9; his
sister, Marlene, 7, and a 2-year-old neighbor, R.J. Murray.
   The car driver, Stan Dlugolenski, 79, was slightly injured. He
said the car ``just went like a rocket on me'' as he turned a

   ``It just kept going,'' he said. ``I had the car serviced
yesterday. I tried the brakes and they wasn't working. I just
couldn't get it to stop.''
   Police Lt. Victor Gillis said authorities would check the
vehicle for mechanical failure. No charges had been filed Saturday,
Gillis said.
   The car knocked over a small tree before hitting the children.
The car then swerved back onto the road, rolled several hundred
feet, hit another tree and plowed into three cars before stopping.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Nationalist Party began
Saturday to partially dismantle its old-guard leadership, but it
has yet to decide how much new blood to inject into its top ranks.
   The party removed 10 of the 31 members of the policy-making
Central Standing Committee, including five who are in their 80s.
The 10 were named to the Central Advisory Committee, an honorary
supervisory group of mostly retired officials.
   Nationalist leaders have stressed the importance of promoting
younger members of the party, known as the Kuomingtang, which was
formed 94 years ago on the Chinese mainland and has for four
decades claimed to be the sole rightful ruler of China.
   Party spokesman Raymond Tai told reporters that the new Central
Standing Committee will be named Thursday at the end of the
weeklong 13th party congress. A Cabinet overhaul is expected later.
   Most of the aging leaders in the current Central Standing
Committee _ whose members' average age is 70 _ fled to Taiwan from
the Chinese mainland in 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek and his
Nationalist government were routed by the Communists.
   These older Nationalists still hold a majority of seats in the
Parliament and support the party's claim that it has the right to
govern China.
   The personnel changes are likely to determine the pace for
continuing the liberalization program started by President Chiang
Ching-kuo before his death in January. Chiang, the eldest son of
Chiang Kai-shek, lifted martial law, allowed new political parties
and eased a ban on travel to mainland China.
   President Lee Teng-hui, who Friday was elected the first native
Taiwanese party chairman, has vowed to continue the democratic
changes, but he has moved cautiously in the past months in order to
consolidate his power.
   The new members of the advisory committee were proposed by Lee
and approved by the party congress.
   Three media executives on the Central Standing Committee who
have said they want to give way to a younger leadership also were
named to the advisory panel.
   But two influential 74-year-old conservatives on the
policy-making committee _ Premier Yu Kuo-hwa and Shen Chang-huan,
secretary to the president _were not reassigned.
   The Independence Evening Post newspaper said Saturday that Yu
and four other elder statesmen will remain a major force as ``the
old generals lead the team while the young officials intern.''
   ``This will be a very conservative restructuring,'' wrote
political commentator Antonio Chiang. He added that as the older
politicians' power base diminishes, younger members of the party
may be more willing to speak out.
   The 1,209 delegates to the party congress will elect a
180-member Central Committee on Tuesday. For the first time, the
vote will not be limited to candidates proposed by the party.
   Discussions among congress delegates on topics ranging from
agriculture to China reportedly became heated Saturday.
   ``The atmosphere of this congress is different'' from previous
ones, said spokesman Tai. ``There was serious debate and
discussions, and delegates made candid suggestions to party
leaders.''

<HEAD>Reagan Invites Capitol Hill Storytellers For Evening Of `Yarn
Swapping'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With the first lady out of town and the
president looking for a good time, invitations went out to some of
the best storytellers on Capitol Hill for an evening of ``yarn
swapping'' at the White House.
   ``He just wanted to have the boys come in, have dinner, and have
a bull session,'' Alabama Sen. Howell Heflin said Saturday. ``Most
of it was just levity and jokes. It was just sort of a night out
with the boys.''
   Mrs. Reagan was in New York to meet with her publisher, Random
House, about plans to write her memoirs.
   Democrat Heflin was one of six legislators who shared their best
stories with President Reagan during a four-hour session Friday
night in the president's private quarters at the White House.
   And what were some of those best stories?
   ``That's one thing there's a pledge of secrecy on,'' Heflin
said. ``At least on the stories he might have told, anyway. ...
There were a lot of good ones, but they're all super secret.''
   Heflin said he told Reagan his story about ``expectations,''
where the elderly lady, after striking up a conversation on an
airplane with an elderly gentleman, pats him on the knee and tells
him he reminds her of her third husband.
   ``The man said, `Oh, is that right. And how many times have you
been married?' And she replied, `twice,''' Heflin said.
   The evening's conversation drifted into serious discussion only
rarely, according to Heflin. Once was when Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., asked Reagan what he would most like to see his successor
accomplish.
   ``He said he would like to see him push forward and adopt a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget and also to get a
line item veto,'' Heflin said. ``And then we discussed those
aspects of fiscal responsibility.''
   On another occasion, Heflin said, Reagan told the group about
some of his discussions with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
during the Moscow summit in May.
   Reagan also talked at length about his early days in the movies,
Heflin said, and at one point he described all the ``considerations
and ethics boards and everything'' that had to be cleared before
Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, could use the word ``damn'' in
the closing scene of ``Gone With The Wind.''
   ``He was in effect decrying the ways movies have changed,''
Heflin said. ``He talked about how the movies used to have a power
of suggestion that the mind worked on and now there is so much
activity that it leaves nothing for the mind to imagine.''
   In addition to Heflin and Rostenkowski, others invited to the
Friday evening session with the president were Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill., Rep. Gene Taylor, R-Mo., Rep.
Marvin Leath, D-Texas, and Kenneth Duberstein, the White House
chief of staff.

<HEAD>Critics Denounce Namphy's Revocation Of Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Critics said Saturday that Lt. Gen.
Henri Namphy's decision to discard the constitution approved 15
months ago demonstrates that the army has no intention of returning
the country to democracy.
   ``The army is sick of this talk of democracy. The truth is they
don't want elections,'' said Paul Latortue, a former senatorial
candidate in Haiti who lives in exile in Puerto Rico.
   Namphy said Friday night on state television that the existing
constitution included ``elements foreign to Haitian tradition'' and
was ``unhappily written and ratified in a climate of passion and
emotion.'' He said a new constitution would be written ``taking
Haitian reality into account.''
   ``We are experiencing a catastrophe,'' said Louis Roy, co-author
of the constitution and its most prominent defender. ``The entire
army and its commander-in-chief, Namphy, have committed perjury.
They swore allegiance to the constitution a year ago in spite of
the faults that they find in it now.''
   In a June 19 coup, Namphy ousted President Leslie Manigat, a
political science professor who was elected four months earlier and
is now in exile.
   Namphy ruled Haiti between the fall of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier in February 1986 and Manigat's inauguration two years
later. The military officer repeatedly pledged to respect the
constitution, approved by 99 percent of Haitians in a March 1987
referendum.
   Among the guests invited to listen to Namphy's speech Friday at
his palace in Port-au-Prince were former presidential candidates
Gerard Phillipe-Auguste, who was Manigat's agriculture Minister,
and Gregoire Eugene, now Namphy's adviser on constitutional law.
   Also present were two former Duvalier aides, Claude Raymond and
Clovis Desinor, and the entire army High Command, including Col.
Jean-Claude Paul, recently indicted in Miami on charges of drug
trafficking.
   ``It was a comic and pathetic gathering Friday night at the
palace,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a prominent opposition leader.
   ``A gang of dinosaurs have emerged from their caves to reassure
each other that their treasure would not be threatened by several
million human beings on the way to the polls to vote,'' said Bajeux.
   In January, Manigat was declared the winner of army-organized
elections boycotted by most Haitians.
   When asked to comment on Namphy's allegation that the
constitution was inspired by foreign ideas and was contrary to
Haitian tradition, Latortue said, ``He is saying returning exiles
bring undersirable ideas of change. I think Namphy regretted the
decision to open the door to exiles after Duvalier left.''
Meanwhile, at the end of a four-day summit of Caribbean Community
leaders in Antigua, Trinidad-Tobago Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson
criticized the organization for not condemning Namphy.
   ``I have no doubt whatsoever from the history of Gen. Namphy
that he has no commitment to the democratic process,'' Robinson
said.
   Streets were quiet in Port-au-Prince on Saturday and business
and public transportation functioned normally.
   ``It is obviously illusory to think of the full enjoyment of
rights and liberties in the context of absolute poverty in which
nearly 70 percent of the population ... is vegetating,'' Namphy
said in his speech.
   But he said his government would respect freedom of speech and
assembly and the right to participate in labor unions and political
parties.
   Latortue said Namphy's action pushes Haiti even farther away
from democratic rule. ``The army and the Duvalierists never liked
the constitution. They want an authoritarian regime. I see the path
to democracy as blocked,'' he said.
   The army has directly or indirectly ruled this impoverished
Caribbean nation for most of its 184-year history.

<HEAD>With Oil-Rig Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The list of dead in the disaster on
the Piper Alpha oil platform is an index of 166 private disasters.
   A bride of a few weeks became a widow. A man died because he
volunteered to return to work a week early. A 19-year-old who had
worked offshore only a few days perished in the explosion and fire
120 miles east of Scotland in the North Sea.
   Alice Williamson, a 25-year-old nurse, was settling into married
life in Aberdeen when her 24-year-old husband Paul returned to
Piper Alpha on Wednesday, the day it exploded.
   She waited 24 hours for her worst fears to be confirmed.
``Something inside me told me he wouldn't be coming back,'' she
said Saturday. ``I just knew.''
   Rig worker David Henderson, 28, would have returned returned
home Monday, the day before his wife Margaret expects to give birth.
   Safety officer Cyril Gray, 49, was to begin vacation Tuesday and
telephoned his wife two hours before the explosion.
   ``He phoned every night,'' Mrs. Gray said. ``He said he would
phone me the next day and then said he loved me.''
   Offshore production manager Donald Reid arrived on Piper Alpha
only hours before the explosion.
   Mark Ashton, 19, was a trainee technician who started working
offshore just a few days before.
   ``He ... was very enthusiastic about his new job,'' said
Ashton's 16-year-old brother Jonathan. ``He was really looking
forward to going offshore last Saturday.''
   William McGregor, 48, volunteered to return to work a week
early. He had been planning to marry in a few weeks.
   The platform's entire catering crew of 18 was killed. They
arrived on Piper Alpha a week earlier when their employers, Kelvin
Catering, took over the food contract.
   Engineer John Cooper, 37, was telephoning his mother to tell her
he would be home on leave the following day when Piper Alpha blew
up, she said.
   Cooper told his mother, Harriet: ``Just a minute, I think
there's been an explosion,'' then the line went dead.
   Two girls, aged 9 and 10 could not accept that their father, oil
rigger Harold Green, would never come home again and they are under
sedation.
   Green's wife, Lesley, said: ``I think they think he is only hurt
and that he's still going to come home.''
   Tony Sinnett survived and said his workmate, rigging foreman
Tommy Hayes, 39, was a hero.
   Sinnett said Hayes took breathing equipment from the platform's
reception area and urged men sheltering in the crew's quarters to
leave the rig. He said Hayes saved as many as 17 lives but the time
it took cost his own.
   Hayes had a wife, Lynda, and two teen-age children.
   The brother of one victim watched from another platform as
flames engulfed the Piper Alpha.
   Keith Ellis was on a rig 20 miles away, watching the Piper Alpha
burn with his brother David on board.
   ``We could see the blaze clearly and I couldn't take my eyes off
it for 12 hours,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who took a child's playhouse from a
judge's home and was later tracked down, held at gunpoint and
handcuffed by the judge has been sentenced to 15 years in prison.
   Jimmy Garcia, 17, also had his probation revoked Friday by
Wallace Moore, visiting state district judge. Garcia had been on
probation for burglary.
   Moore also complimented Harris County Judge Al Leal, who handles
misdemeanor cases and caught Garcia.
   ``I wish you'd come to my neighborhood,'' Moore told Leal.
   Leal spotted Garcia and another man stealing a children's
playhouse at Leals' home on April 25, a day after the judge's car
was burglarized.
   On April 27, after receiving information that the missing
playhouse was at a nearby apartment complex, Leal flagged down a
policeman and led him on a search for his missing property.
   Leal saw Garcia on a bicycle and accosted the youth. The judge
pulled a gun on the teen-ager and put handcuffs on him.
   Prosecutor Jules Laird said Leal was fully within his rights to
carry a gun and function as a policeman.

<HEAD>Carlucci: Stable Funding Needed For Military Projects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci called
Saturday for stable congressional funding to discourage military
contractors from seeking short-term profits and political advantage.
   Carlucci said a lack of such funding provides incentives for
contractors to neglect long-term investment, to try to influence
funding decisions by the Pentagon and Congress, and to gain
information about contract awards through consultants.
   Carlucci said the ``cumbersome and complex'' defense procurement
system provides too many chances for ``congressional
micro-management and influence by special advocates.''
   That system has led contractors to look for short-term
advantages, both financially and politically, he told the
Philadelphia World Affairs Council.
   ``And the best way for contractors to do that in our current
system is to invest in `market intelligence' _ a euphemism for
hiring consultants and lobbyists to intervene in the process in the
executive branch and on Capitol Hill,'' Carlucci said.
   ``Multiyear budgeting, long-term contracts, freezing weapons
design, simplifying requirements, contracting to performance _ all
of these techniques can be used to streamline the process and
strengthen the hand of the program manager, while weakening the
influence of the special advocates,'' he added.
   Carlucci, who would not answer questions from reporters after
his speech, said he was disturbed by the allegations raised by a
Justice Department investigation that military contractors and
consultants had bribed Pentagon officials. No one has been charged
in the case.
   ``As soon as information becomes available to us from the
Justice Department, we will act promptly to review contracts and
take appropriate suspension, debarment and termination actions, as
we have already done,'' he said.

<HEAD>State Threatens To Revoke Insurance Company's License</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance company faces revocation of
its license in Minnesota if it refuses to issue drought-insurance
policies to about 1,000 farmers who paid for more than $40 million
in coverage, a state official says.
   Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch said Friday that
New Jersey-based Chubb Insurance Cos. informed farmers who paid for
the policies by a June 15 deadline that the policies will not be
issued.
   But under a 1987 state law, once an insurance agent accepts and
cashes a check from a farmer, the policy cannot be canceled by
either party, Hatch said. All checks were cashed by June 15, Hatch
said.
   ``We've told the company that we want the policies issued,''
Hatch said. ``We're saying if you don't issue the policies, we'll
ask the attorney general's office to prepare documents to revoke''
the company's license to do business in Minnesota.
   Hatch said a meeting is scheduled Monday between state officials
and company representatives.
   Company officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Chubb had told Minnesota insurance agents that the sales should
be canceled and premiums refunded to buyers, Hatch said. The
company explained that sales exceeded its capacity.
   Hatch said Chubb was remiss for deciding halfway through a
drought-stricken summer to refund premiums on drought coverage.
   When the issue first arose last week, Chubb contended that it
had taken applications that didn't translate into coverage until it
approved them. Some of the applications contain such a statement
and others don't, Hatch said.
   The insurance would begin paying buyers a percentage of the full
amount if rainfall fell below 70 percent of normal at the nearest
official rain gauge during June, July and August. The lower the
rainfall, the higher the amount paid.

   Dozens of television and print
reporters tagged along as Broward Sheriff's deputies busted 107
drug suspects and swung sledgehammers to demolish five abandoned
houses frequented by crack dealers.
   The activities Friday were part of ``Operation Crackdown,'' the
third sweep this year conducted by the sheriff's office for the
media to watch. Some of the arrests were sting operations, in which
deputies posed as drug dealers.
   ``The media draw attention to it,'' said sheriff's spokesman Al
Gordon. ``We want people to know that when they buy drugs in
Broward County, they may be buying from a deputy. And they're going
to jail.''
   Also taking part in the arrests were officers from Margate,
North Lauderdale and Pompano Beach police agenices. But not all
area police forces like the idea.
   ``An arrest is an arrest is an arrest whether or not it's on the
6 o'clock news,'' said Hollywood Police Chief Richard Witt,
describing Broward Sheriff Nick Navarro as ``a media mogul.''
   ``When we conduct street-level operations, to us, the media gets
in the way,'' said Fort Lauderdale Police Chief Joe Gerwens. ``I
think narcotics operations are complicated enough without dragging
the media along.
   ``We don't operate that way. We turned away Geraldo (Rivera, the
television talk show host) ... on two occasions,'' Gerwens said.
   Rivera in September 1986 took part in a similar sweep by the
Broward Sheriff's Office.
   The television personality posed as the financier in the
undercover sting, and used videotape of it for his television
special, ``American Vice: The Doping of a Nation,'' broadcast
months later.
   In Friday's sweep, besides demolitions and the arrests,
Operation Crackdown netted 10 guns from one home, had 40 cars towed
from in front of vacant houses, and small amounts of crack and
marijuana, said spokesman Gordon. Crack is a form of cocaine that's
smoked.
   Among those arrested was former Pompano Beach policeman James
Evans, who was charged with trying to buy cocaine from an
undercover officer.

   You've got to have art and it shouldn't be
confused with pornography, a Kenosha woman contends.
   So she is challenging an obscenity law in hopes of helping other
artists after she was forced to put her wooden sculpture of a nude
man and woman under wraps.
   Marta Brewer, 31, filed a suit last week in U.S. District Court
here asking the court to declare unconstitutional a Kenosha
ordinance because it infringes on her First Amendment rights to
free expression.
   ``The reason I filed the suit was partly for myself and partly
for all the artists who I'm sure don't appreciate censorship,''
Brewer said.
   Eunice Z. Edgar, executive director of the Wisconsin Civil
Liberties Union, said the ordinance wrongly places Brewer's
sculpture ``in the same category as hard-core'' pornography.
   Brewer displayed the life-size sculptures with some of her oil
paintings in May in front of her home. Police said the sculpture of
the nude figures has movable joints and can assume a sexual
position and thus violated the ordinance barring the public display
of explicit sexual material.
   Although she conceded that the figures can assume a sexual
position, Brewer said smut was not the main focus of the work and
that the figures never were displayed in a sexual position.

   They call it ``canuding'' and
it's part of National Nude Weekend.
   Michael Gesner and about 30 friends plan to celebrate with a
canoeing trip on the Delaware River Sunday in the nude.
   ``Being a naturist has to do with feeling good about yourself,''
said the 42-year-old Gesner, head of two nudist groups.
   Gesner and members of the Tri-State Sun Club and Tri-State Metro
Naturist Inc. said they'll gather at the Delaware Water Gap
National Recreational Area for fun in the sun on a 40-mile stretch
of the river between the Pennsylvania communities of Stroudsburg
and Shawnee.
   As for other people who might encounter the ``canudists,''
Gesner said, ``If they haven't seen us already, they've heard of
us. And because of the canoes, they can only see the top half.''
   National Nude Weekend, sponsored by The Naturist Society of
Oshkosh, Wis., and The American Sunbathing Association of
Kissimmee, Fla., will also feature political discussions in the
nude in Alabama, square dances in the buff in Massachusetts and
nude sky diving in Georgia.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain was widely scattered over the eastern two-thirds of the
nation Saturday, and extreme heat returned to the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys with more record temperatures.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along a cold front crossing
the north-central states, and a severe thunderstorm watch was
posted for sections of northern and central Minnesota, northeastern
South Dakota and a small part of southeastern North Dakota.
   Showers and thunderstorms were fairly numerous from northwestern
Oklahoma through the eastern half of Nebraska to southwestern
Wisconsin.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed across western Texas,
along the central Gulf Coast, across southern and central Florida,
in the middle Atlantic Coast region; and in New England,
particularly in northern Maine.
   Atlantic, N.J., got 1.62 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2
p.m. EDT.
   Showers prevailed in the southern and central Rockies.
   Temperatures soared above 100 degrees across parts of Tennessee,
Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio.
   Record highs included 95 at Binghamton, N.Y.; 100 at Huntington,
W.Va.; 102 at Louisville, Ky.; 100 at Knoxville, Tenn.; 94 at
Mansfield, Ohio; 101 at Nashville, Tenn.; and 99 at Roanoke, Va.
   Buffalo, N.Y., tied its record for the date of 92, marking a
record six days in a row of 90 or higher heat. As far north as
Maine, Portland tied its record of 92.
   On the other hand, Jacksonville, Fla., had a record low of 66
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at Hoquiam, Wash., to 110 at Needles and Palm Springs,
Calif. The early morning low for the day was 33 degrees at Jackson,
Wyo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
across much of the area from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic
Coast, expecially in the upper Great Lakes and Florida.
   Highs only in the 70s were predicted from North Dakota to Upper
Michigan, and along the Pacific Coast; above 90 in much of the area
from the southern Plains to the Atlantic Coast states; and above
100 in the Tennessee Valley, the lower Ohio Valley and the desert
Southwest, where some readings will approach 115. Elsewhere,
temperatures will generally be in the 80s.

   Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protesters
clashed in street battles across the occupied territories Saturday.
One Palestinian was fatally shot, raising the death toll to 217 as
the uprising against Israeli rule entered its eighth month.
   A general strike shut down commerce in major cities and towns.
   Palestinian reports said at least 34 protesters were injured.
The army put the figure at 11.
   Palestinian reporters said soldiers fatally shot 25-year-old
Fayek Suleiman Hussein in the heart after opening fire on
stone-throwing protesters in Jebalya refugee camp in the occupied
Gaza Strip. Hospital officials said two people were injured.
   The army confirmed the death in Jebalya but said it was
investigating the circumstances.
   Officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza said a woman, Suad Dib
Ippbail, 34, was wounded in the hand by gunfire during the clash in
Jebalaya.
   A five-year-old boy, Samir Mahmud Zidan, also suffered wounds in
the face, left hand and left leg when he played with an explosive
during or after the clash, the officials said. It was not
immediately known what kind of explosive was involved.
   Palestinian reporters said earlier that both people injured in
Jebalya were wounded by gunfire.
   In Arura, near the West Bank city of Ramallah, witnesses said
soldiers beat five demonstrators during a raid and fractured a
man's skull by knocking his head against a wall and beating it with
a rifle butt.
   The army said troops detained several stone-throwing youths in
Arura after chasing them into homes. It said it was investigating
charges of excessive force.
   Stores were closed and public transportation was halted in Arab
East Jerusalem, Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron, Gaza City and other main
towns in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The shutdowns, expected to last at least through Sunday, follow
the instructions of a leaflet signed by the ``Unified National
Leadership of the Uprising-the PLO.''
   In some cities, such as Nablus, the strike began Friday under
orders contained in different leaflets apparently issued by a rival
underground faction.
   The strikes signified the start of the eighth month of the
uprising, which began Dec. 8. According to official figures, 217
Arabs have been killed. Four Israelis have died.
   Clashes broke out in half a dozen towns and refugee camps in the
occupied territories.
   In Arura, a village of 3,000, Arabs hurled blocks and bottles at
soldiers, the army said, after soldiers apparently entered the area
after midnight to conduct arrests.
   One soldier received medical treatment after being struck in the
shoulder by a block, and then the troops chased the stone-throwers
into homes and detained several of them hiding under beds, an army
spokesman said.
   During the ensuing raid, soldiers broke furniture and windows in
at least 10 homes and beat five villagers with sticks and rifle
butts, said Joost Hiltermann, a spokesman for Law in the Service of
Man, the West Bank affiliate of the Geneva-based International
Commission of Jurists.
   Hassan Abdel Rahman, 23, was in intensive care at nearby
Ramallah Hospital with a fractured skull after being beaten with a
rifle butt and having his head smashed into a wall, hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed three Palestinians were injured and
hospitalized after soldiers used ``reasonable force'' to try to
detain them. It said it would investigate complaints about the
beatings and vandalism.
   In a clash at the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, soldiers
opened fire on stone-throwers who surrounded the troops, wounding
17-year-old Mohammed Abu Silmiya in the leg, the army said.
   Palestinian reports said 17 people were treated for tear gas and
beating injuries after the incident.
   Also in Gaza, a Palestinian reporter said a 22-year-old man,
Shawki Mohammed Khalil Odeh, was hospitalized and his right eye
swollen shut after soldiers beat him in the head and kicked him
after a stoning attack on troops.
   The army said soldiers imposed curfews on four refugee camps in
Gaza and closed the West Bank's largest city of Nablus to
reporters, declaring it a closed military zone.
   Soldiers fought for 90 minutes with protesters in Bani Naim near
Hebron, and three protesters were injured by rubber bullets, Arab
reports said.
   The army said six demonstrators were injured by rubber bullets
in the Aida refugee camp near Bethlehem after soldiers fired on
several Palestinians who tried to grab a gun from a soldier and
stoned the troops.

   Fire quickly engulfed an old, wood-frame
rooming house early Saturday, killing three people and seriously
burning another, and a rash of smaller fires was reported across
the city.
   Fire Chief Larry Dickinson said firefighters were kept busy
going from fire to fire as flames broke out in 10 separate places
in garbage bins, brush along fence lines and in an apartment
building 20 blocks from the destroyed rooming house. Only minor
damage was reported in those fires.
   John Fifer, assistant fire chief in this south-central
Washington town of 18,000, said a state fire marshal had been
called in to determine whether the fatal fire was linked to the
others, which he said were probably arson.
   ``We are presuming those (others) are all set fires,'' he said.
There have been no arrests, officials said.
   The state investigator was on the scene Saturday afternoon, said
firefighter Dennis Morris. But he and others said they did not want
to be too quick to label the fatal fire as arson before they had
ruled out other possible causes.
   ``You can always say arson, but that is a pretty easy way out,''
Morris said.
   The dead were tentatively identified, but authorities were
withholding their names pending positive identification and
notification of relatives. All three victims were males, Fifer said.
   The manager of the destroyed building, Godfrey Davis, said he
discovered the fire at 3:45 a.m. as he got up to go to work.
   ``When I opened the door, it seemed like all hell was busting
loose,'' Davis said. ``It knocked me back. So then I started
hollering, `Get everybody out there! It's a fire!'''
   One of the victims was a double amputee who called down the
stairs from the second floor that he couldn't find his artificial
legs in the smoke, Davis said. He said he told the frightened man
to jump, but he wouldn't.
   Morris said the rubble from the rooming house was searched and
no other victims were found. There were reportedly 20 to 25 people
in the two-story building when the fire hit.
   Davis said it seemed to him that the fire had begun outside the
building, but fire officials said they had not determined where it
began.
   The fires at the apartment building 20 blocks away were set in a
garbage can and a laundry room, but were quickly extinguished, said
fire officials.
   The burned man was taken to Our Lady of Lourdes Health Center
and later transferred to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, said
Lourdes nursing supervisor Peggy Tschauner. She identified him as
Steven Knight, 32.
   At Harborview, Knight was listed in serious condition with
second and third-degree burns over 30 percent of his body.
   The Red Cross was handing out food and blankets to those left
homeless by the blaze.
   The first fire was reported in a garbage bin, and the second to
be reported was the fatal fire, Fifer said. The other eight fires
were discovered later.
   ``While we were fighting the fire at this location (the rooming
house), we had a couple of engines as a task force going from one
fire to another ... handling those (smaller) fires,'' Fifer said.

   NATO sailors who were diverted from
their maneuvers in the North Sea to help search for victims of the
Piper Alpha oil platform disaster said Saturday it caused in them
the dread all seamen have of fire.
   ``When you have been at sea, you know you are always one step
away from a disaster like that,'' said Rear Adm. John Scott Redd of
the U.S. Navy, who commands the alliance's Standing Naval Force
Atlantic.
   ``You live with that. Whenever it happens there is a desire to
come to the assistance of those in trouble on the sea,'' he said.
   Redd said conditions were excellent in the normally brutal North
Sea as the six NATO ships approached the burning wreckage, with
good visibility and relatively calm waters.
   ``We had all the conditions required to find survivors, had
there been any,'' he said. ``If you looked anywhere except where
the platform was burning, it was a nice, pleasant day.''
   The scene around the Piper Alpha was different, however.
   ``It quickly became apparent what an awful tragedy had occurred
when you saw things like a burned-out lifeboat, bits of furniture
and floating debris from the platform,'' he said.
   Redd spoke to reporters after the NATO warships involved in the
search returned to Portsmouth, 65 miles southwest of London.
   Cmdr. Alan Phillips of the Royal Navy said his ship, HMS Phoebe,
sometimes was only 400 yards from the platform, which exploded and
burned Wednesday night with the loss of 166 lives.
   ``You could hardly see the rig,'' he said. ``it was engulfed in
flames. It brought home the fear any mariner has of fire at sea.''

<HEAD>Shultz Criticizes China for Building, Selling Missiles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
Saturday criticized China for building and selling the same
missiles Washington and Moscow have agreed to destroy.
   ``There is an irony in that just as we are eliminating
nuclear-armed ballistic missiles in the range of 500 to 5,000
kilometers (310 to 3,100 miles), the Chinese are producing exactly
those weapons,'' Shultz said.
   He said Beijing was selling the rockets, without nuclear
warheads, to countries ``around the world.'' He did not specify the
countries.
   Shultz spoke at a news conference in Bangkok, Thailand, before
traveling to the Indonesian capital of Jakarta for discussions on
informal talks scheduled later this month on a political settlement
of the Cambodian war.
   He also voiced opposition to a long-standing proposal to declare
Southeast Asia a nuclear-free zone, saying: ``Deterrents have kept
peace in parts of the world.''
   The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations has
endorsed the concept of a neutral region free of nuclear weapons.
Shultz said attempts should not be made ``to restrict the quality
of deterrents by a zonal approach'' but rather by balanced
reductions of existing nuclear stockpiles held by the superpowers.
   Shultz is expected to raise the issue of missile sales when he
meets with leaders in Beijing during his two-week, nine-nation
Asian tour.
   The tour, which began Wednesday in Bangkok, also includes
Malaysia, the Philipines, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the
Marshall Islands.
   In recent years, China has become the fourth largest seller of
weapons to the Third World. It has provided Silkworm missiles to
Iran and fighter planes to Iran's enemy Iraq as well as ``East
Wind'' intermediate-range missiles to Saudi Arabia.
   News reports have quoted Israeli officials as saying they fear
China may sell the advanced M-9 missile, still in an experimental
stage, to Syria, Israel's arch enemy. Syria has denied trying to
buy the missile.
   Also Saturday, Shultz discussed human rights with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in the Malaysian capital, Kuala
Lampur.
   Shultz said that in their three-hour meeting, Mahathir assured
him that prisoners detained without trial in Malaysian jails would
be accorded their full rights.
   Twenty-eight U.S. congressmen, the Washington-based Asia Watch
human rights group and the New York City-based Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights asked Shultz to raise their concerns over
detentions under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, the two human
rights groups said.
   The act allows the government to arrest and detain people
without trial indefinitely.
   Last fall, Mahathir ordered the arrest of 106 people critical of
his government, including the leader of the opposition in
Parliament, Lim Kit Siang. He defended the arrests at the time by
saying the detainees instigated racial clashes between the
country's Malays and ethnic Chinese.
   ``The subject was discussed ... fundamentally in a satisfactory
way,'' Shultz said, speaking to a news conference before leaving
for Jakarta.
   Opposition leaders have accused Mahathir of emasculating the
legal system, curbing the press and endangering democracy on the
pretext of quelling tensions between ethnic Chinese and Malays.
   Shultz offered no specific plan to end the Cambodian quagmire,
saying Washington was following ASEAN's lead. The organization
calls for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops from Cambodia,
the introduction of an international peacekeeping force and
U.S.-supervised elections.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman, who briefed reporters
on the flight to Jakarta, said Shultz received assurances from both
Thailand and Malaysia they would continue to grant temporary asylum
to Vietnamese boat people refugees. Both countries, facing a new
influx of Vietnamese, had threatened to take tough action.
   Shultz also gained informal support, Redman said, for a U.S.
proposal to set up a Bangkok-based working group to explore fresh
solutions to the 30-year-old refugee exodus from communist Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia.
   ``We will continue our strong support for humanitarian treatment
of refugees and we will continue our strong intake,'' Shultz said
at the news conference in Kuala Lumpur.
   In Bangkok, Shultz held talks with the foreign ministers of
ASEAN member countries.
   Shultz plays golf Sunday with top Indonesian officials and on
Monday holds talks with President Suharto.

<HEAD>Defense Ministry Reports Two Rebel Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said U.S.-backed
rebels twice attacked troops Saturday in violation of a
government-declared cease-fire, killing two soldiers in one attack
and losing four dead in another.
   The ministry said in a statement that the rebels, known as
Contras, killed two soldiers, wounded one and captured four others
in a morning ambush about 90 miles northeast of Managua in the
province of Matagalpa.
   In another incident in a remote region near the Caribbean coast,
four rebels were killed when they attacked Sandinista troops, the
statement said.
   The government has declared a unilateral cease-fire until July
31 to allow time to restart stalled peace talks.
   A fragile truce has been in effect since March 21, but no new
sessions of talks have been scheduled to end the nearly 7-year-old
war between the Contras and the leftist Sandinista regime.
   The Contras agreed to go along with the latest cease-fire as
long as they weren't attacked. Saturday's Defense Ministry
statement was the latest in a series of government charges that the
rebels are ignoring the truce.
   It said Defense Minister Humberto Ortega has asked a monitoring
commission set up after the first round of talks to verify a rebel
attack July 4 in the Chontales province. The government says 12
soldiers and civilians were killed in that attack.
   The Sandinistas came to power in July 1979 after 42 years of
rule by the rightist, pro-U.S. government of Anastasio Somoza.

<HEAD>Woman in Critical Condition After Tiger Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOTHELL, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman was critically injured when a
tiger attacked her after she fell during a filming session for the
Boeing Co. at a wild game farm, authorities said.
   Clara Frobig, 40, was listed in critical condition Saturday at
Evergreen Hospital in Kirkland following surgery for severe wounds
to the head, neck and shoulder.
   The owner of Animal Advocates wild game farm, Anne Gordon, said
Ms. Frobig had been working as a volunteer about a month.
   Boeing needed footage of a tiger running through tall grass. The
tiger, named Sultan, was to be unleashed by an assistant and run to
Ms. Gordon, who was holding food, for the filming. Volunteers held
portable fencing to help corral the animal.
   After a successful dry run, the tiger began his lope, then
veered toward the fence that Ms. Frobig was holding, Ms. Gordon
said. Ms. Frobig moved to readjust the fence but fell in the bumpy
grass.
   ``When she fell down, the tiger was thinking, `Oh, this is a fun
toy.' When he did bite, he became possessive and didn't want anyone
to take her away. He carried her about 10 feet,'' Ms. Gordon said.
   She said one assistant hit the tiger with a heavy stick and
another dove onto the animal, trying to get him to let go. After
the tiger backed off, Ms. Gordon calmed it down and took it back to
its cage.
   Sultan, a 3-year-old, 500-pound Bengal tiger, remained in
quarantine at Animal Advocates. Ms. Gordon said she had owned him
since he was 3 weeks old, and he never attacked anyone before.
   Ms. Gordon, 30, a former zookeeper in Seattle, said she had
operated the farm as a non-profit organization for five years,
mostly to raise and train animals and take them to schools to teach
children about wildlife. She said she would now close the farm.
   It was animals from Animal Advocates that starred in the movie
``Harry and the Hendersons,'' Ms. Gordon said.

<HEAD>Jackson Denies He Will Walk Out Of Convention; Promises Lively
Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA METZLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson on Saturday denied reports he
and his delegates might stage a walkout at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta but promised the convention would feature
lively debate.
   ``It will not be sterile,'' he said. ``We can deliberate and
debate without being divisive.''
   Although Democratic rival Michael Dukakis is assured the party's
presidential nomination, Jackson gave no sign Saturday of backing
down.
   ``Some people have made unreasonable requests, like if we would
just surrender, we would have a prime-time speaking place,'' he
said.
   ``My name will be in nomination,'' he said. ``We will have
(platform) planks on the floor, those that are not resolved between
now and that time, and that should be a reasonable expectation.''
   But he added that he does not plan to lead a walkout of his
delegates.
   ``It would not be to our advantage to walk out,'' Jackson said.
``The threat is not that we're going to walk out. The threat is
that we're going to stay and expand and build and grow and make a
difference.''
   Jackson spoke to reporters as he attended a small private
fund-raiser for his Keep Hope Alive Political Action Committee at
the Bel Air Estates home of director-producer Larkin Arnold.
   The Jackson and Dukakis camps already have resolved disputes
over party rules and delegate credentials, and Jackson said he
expects negotiators for both campaigns to continue meeting to
settle differences on other subjects.
   He called for an expanded schedule at the convention to allow
minority issues to be addressed.
   ``We're making history not hysteria,'' he said. ``We're doing
what's standard and what's normal and what we've earned the right
to do.''
   Jackson reserved comment on potential vice presidential
candidates, and said he and Dukakis have yet to personally discuss
in depth the possibility of Jackson being the running mate. Jackson
said he expects to have such a private talk before the start of the
convention on July 18.
   Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin told the Boston Globe
this week that Jackson's followers would be ``outraged,'' as would
Austin himself, if Dukakis picked former presidential candidate
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee as his running mate.
   Jackson said the comment had been Austin's personal opinion.
   ``No one is authorized in my campaign to give a value judgment
or a political evaluation of anyone else under consideration,'' he
said.
   Jackson confirmed he had sent a private message to Gore stating
that he personally has not made any private or public judgment
regarding any potential running mate's qualifications for the vice
presidential slot.

   Iraq said its forces recaptured a series
of mountain peaks in its northern Kurdistan mountains Saturday
after a four-day battle with Iranian forces.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus,
said numerous areas along the northern front were taken back,
including 14 mountain peaks.
   It also said Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery shot down an Iranian
F-4 jet fighter as it attempted to cross into Iraqi territory.
   A report carried by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
denied losing any planes Saturday. IRNA, also monitored in Nicosia,
confirmed there was fighting in the northern mountains.
   In the last three months, the Iraqis have achieved important
victories including the recapture of an oil terminal at Faw in
April, the Salamcheh region in May and the southern oil-rich
Majnoon marshes in June.
   After its victories in the south, Iraq has been concentrating on
driving Iranian forces out of its the northern mountains. Previous
Iraqi communiques have claimed the Iranians were dislodged from
their last mountain strongholds, but the fighting has apparently
continued.
   In another development Saturday, Iran's acting
commander-in-chief Hashemi Rafsanjani met with Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's designated heir to discuss strengthening the war effort,
Tehran radio reported.
   Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri met at
Montazeri's home in the holy city of Qom, 100 miles south of Tehran.
   Montazeri has said Iran's Revolutionary Guards should be merged
with the regular army to streamline the chain of command.
Rafsanjani favors a joint command but has argued against merging
the two formations.
   The guards are a major power base for Rafsanjani.
   There have been sharp differences in Iran's religious hierarchy
over the military formations, especially after recent defeats in
the nearly 8-year-old conflict with Iraq.
   Rafsanjani was appointed acting commander-in-chief by Khomeini
on June 2.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said Saturday a plan
by George Bush to boost fees for some government services amounts
to raising taxes, something the Republican vice president has said
he would not do.
   ``I understand yesterday he had some difficulty distinguishing
between certain kinds of taxes and other taxes,'' Dukakis said.
``Back where I come from, if it looks like a duck and walks like a
duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.''
   Jesse Jackson, as he attended a private fund-raiser in Los
Angeles, denied reports he and his delegates might stage a walkout
at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   ``The threat is not that we're going to walk out,'' he told
reporters. ``The threat is that we're going to stay and expand and
build and grow and make a difference.''
   He gave no sign of surrendering to the Dukakis camp, saying,
``my name will be in nomination. We will have (platform) planks on
the floor, those that are not resolved between now and that time,
and that should be a reasonable expectation.''
   Dukakis was referring to comments by the vice president that he
favors higher fees including higher payments for Medicare
recipients who choose to accept catastrophic health care coverage
under terms of recent health legislation.
   ``I don't know if Mr. Bush has problems trying to distinguish
between taxes and premiums, but I think we'd better read the fine
print in that insurance policy very, very carefully before we sign
on,'' Dukakis said in opening remarks at a news conference.
   Republicans, meanwhile, holding a rally in Atlanta, attacked
Dukakis on his search for a running mate, his fiscal policies and
his size.
   Lee Atwater, national campaign manager for Bush, said Dukakis'
search for a vice presidential candidate to join him on the ticket
was ``making Hamlet look like the rock of Gibraltar.''
   Atwater also said the Massachusetts governor's decision to raise
taxes in his home state while running for president was ``dumb.''
   ``If you're undertaxed, vote for Dukakis. If you're overtaxed
... we want you in our party,'' said Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., a
former candidate himself for the GOP presidential nomination.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and Florida Gov. Bob Martinez made
cracks about Dukakis' height.
   Thurmond called Dukakis ``a mere midget compared to George
Bush.''
   Martinez said the differences in experience between Bush and
Dukakis amounted to ``the tale of the tall and the short.''
   Dukakis is 5 feet 8 inches tall.
   Dukakis spoke to a group of about 250 students at the Evans
Community Adult School, a public school for immigrants in downtown
Los Angeles.
   Dukakis reminded them of his own immigrant heritage and said to
them, ``You are the future of this country.''
   Dukakis, who will pick up the Democratic presidential nomination
next week in Atlanta, again found himself faced with repeated
questioning on his continuing deliberations about the vice
presidential candidate.
   He said he had not made a decision, did not know when he would
announce one and would meet with senior aide Paul Brountas after
returning to Boston Sunday to discuss the choice.
   At a later appearance in Portland, Ore., Dukakis toured a Navy
ship being refitted at the port shipyard and spoke to a small
crowd. He cited the investigation into alleged fraud on Pentagon
weapons contracts and blasted the Reagan administration, saying it
``not only doesn't believe in public service, it's contemptuous of
public service.''
   ``I don't know what the true nature is of this breaking scandal
over the Pentagon. I don't take any particular pleasure in it _ I
think it's a very sad day,'' Dukakis said. ``But I'll tell you this
_ I'm going to do everything I can as president of the United
States to stop that revolving door'' between the Pentagon and
defense contractors that often hire former military officials.
   Dukakis was flying on to Tacoma, Wash., for a tour of the port
on a tugboat. He was ending the day in the Rocky Mountains at Estes
Park, Colo.
   Dukakis was accompanied throughout his California stop by Sen.
Alan Cranston, who sat with him at a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball
game Friday night. Cranston said he believed Sen. John Glenn of
Ohio remained the most likely vice presidential choice and that
Tennessee Sen. Albert J. Gore Jr. would pose a problem if selected
because he did not run as well in the presidential race as did
Jackson.
   ``I kind of doubt that it will be somebody who ran,'' Cranston
said. ``Unless they pick No. 2, and that's Jesse Jackson, it's a
little awkward to go to somebody who ran third, fourth, fifth,
sixth or seventh.''
   Shortly after arriving in California, Dukakis was asked if he
was consulting with Jackson on the selection of a running mate.
   ``Am I consulting him? No,'' Dukakis said.``We're talking, and
he's one of a number of people I'm considering. As he himself has
said, it's up to the nominee, and I'll make that decision.''

   Eight members of a convoy carrying aid to
Nicaraguan civilians were arrested Saturday during a melee after
they tried to cross a bridge into Mexico.
   The scuffle broke out on the international bridge when officers
sprayed a cayenne-based irritant into the truck of the Veterans
Peace Convoy, which had blocked a traffic lane for four hours.
   Police arrested the eight as 50 of their supporters chanted,
``The whole world is watching!'' and rushed past a line of police
at the bridge toll booth that separates the United States from
Mexico.
   Customs officers said allowing the trucks to leave the United
States without assurances they would be returned would violate a
trade embargo against Nicaragua.
   The convoy, which had tried to cross the same bridge a month
ago, had intended to take 17 vehicles into Mexico at noon Saturday.
Two trucks were driven to the toll booth where Customs officers and
police stopped them.
   Frank Zapata, acting chief Customs inspector, told Bob Livesey,
driver of the convoy's lead pickup, that he could not allow him to
turn onto the Mexico-bound lane.
   ``This is as far as you're going to get,'' Zapata told Livesey.
``You can turn north (back to Texas) here if you want.''
   Livesey responded: ``We're not moving. ... We're either going to
Nicaragua through Mexico here _ this is a free border _ or we're
going to jail.'' He then placed several boxes of baby food on the
hood of his car and refused to budge.
   Four hours later, police again told the trucks' occupants they
must move the vehicles or be arrested. The trucks stayed put, and
officers stuck a nightstick into a window of a truck driven by
Harry Meserve, 45, of Santa Cruz, Calif. The window shattered as
Meserve tried to roll it up. Officers simultaneously sprayed the
cab with the substance laced with cayenne, a very hot, irritating
spice.
   About 50 supporters of the convoy had been watching and rushed
past officers as the arrests began. Some started pounding on a
convoy truck, shouting, ``The whole world is watching!''
   Livesey, 46, a Vietnam veteran from Massachusetts, and Meserve
were among those arrested.
   ``There was a little bit of pushing and shoving but there was
nothing where anybody was in any real, serious danger,'' said
Police Chief Victor Garcia. Once the arrests were made, the crowd
began following officers' orders and moved back, he said.
   Police towed the convoy's pickup trucks off the bridge, and
traffic across it was restored to normal soon afterward.

   ``Caengratulations'' reads an editorial
headline saluting 50 years and about 4.9 miles of columns about the
city's sights and characters by writer Herb Caen.
   ``For 50 years now, Herb Caen has painted word portraits of San
Francisco,'' said state Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, in a short
piece in the San Francisco Chronicle's Sunday Punch section.
   ``Caen's San Francisco may not always be the city we remember,
but it is the city we want to remember,'' he said.
   In its editorial in Sunday's editions, the Chronicle commended
Caen for his ``verve, panache, brilliance, incisiveness, humor,
sympathy.''
   Caen recalled starting the column at the age of 22, as a lucky
young greenhorn from the Sacramento Valley farming city of
Sacramento.
   He referred to himself as the ``kid in the candy store, Dorothy
in Oz, Alice in Wonderland, Tom Swift and his Electric Column.''
   And he expressed his continuing fascination with San Francisco.
   ``A marvelous city to write about,'' he said. ``Like a snake it
sheds its skins, changes its shape, wanders off in unexpected
directions. A hard city for sentimentalists, which most writers
are.''

   Troubleshooter ``Red'' Adair took the
first steps Saturday toward capping the wells of a burned-out oil
platform. The rig's owner said it might take three weeks to find
the bodies of 149 men killed in the North Sea disaster.
   Adair's men explored the twisted remains of the Piper Alpha
platform for about an hour Saturday and used a camera-equipped
submersible vessel to assess the damage, said a statement from the
platform's owner, Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Occidental hired Adair to make the rig safe, seal gas leaks and
save the oil wells to which the rig is connected. The 73-year-old
Adair, based in Houston, Texas, has gained fame over several
decades by capping out-of-control oil wells.
   ``It seems to me there are three or four wells that are burning
... and two are burning pretty good,'' Adair said after examining
the remains of the platform. He said everything was going well
``and we expect to stay on schedule,'' but did not elaborate.
   ``I'd like to say one thing. ... I've never seen so many
safety-conscious people in my life and I think they are doing an
excellent job,'' Adair said.
   The Piper Alpha exploded Wednesday night in a fireball that
Occidental says may have been caused by a gas leak directly below
the living quarters.
   Sixty-four men escaped. Eighteen remained in the Aberdeen Royal
Infirmary on Saturday, one in serious condition.
   Seventeen bodies were recovered before the search was called off
Friday night around the ruined platform 120 miles east of Scotland.
   John Brading, chief executive of Occidental International Oil
Co., told a news conference Saturday the company wants to recover
the bodies but must clear debris from the site of the world's worst
oil field disaster and make the area safe for divers.
   ``I think it's going to be some days before we remove the
debris, and then the capping will begin,'' Brading said in
Aberdeen, where most of the bereaved families live or have
gathered. ``Once the situation is safe, we will send divers down
whose first task will be to search for remains.''
   Occidental said fires still burned at several of the platform's
36 wellheads. It said all leaking oil was burning and none was
escaping to the sea.
   Brading predicted the Piper Alpha disaster would bring ``a whole
number of changes'' in North Sea oil rigs, echoing the views
expressed Friday by Occidental chairman Armand Hammer and Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. The government has ordered public and
technical inquiries.
   ``What might have been an acceptable standard for this day last
week appears to be an unacceptable standard today,'' Brading said.
   David Martin, president of Occidental Oil and Gas, said living
quarters may be separate from the production platform in future.
   ``Living on something which produces oil and gas is, in my
opinion, too dangerous,'' he told the news conference. Martin said
workers would have had to be a quarter-mile from the Piper Alpha to
have been safe. ``There is going to be the question of, `should not
people living there be on something that can back away _ in effect,
be a floating hotel?' '' he said.
   Survivor Harry Calder, 35, has said at least 100 men died
screaming for help, trapped in the rig's living quarters after
suriving the initial explosion.
   Occidental reported part of the rig's accommodation quarters was
retrieved from the site Saturday and a spokesman said: ``It was
described as in good condition. As far as I know no bodies were
found on board.''
   Company officials played down a report in The Scotsman newspaper
quoting retired safety manager Jack Donaldson as saying the company
ignored safety recommendations, after a 1984 explosion on the Piper
Alpha, that included replacing the wooden living-quarters module.
Occidental said the platform complied with all government standards.
   A memorial service for the dead will be held Wednesday in
Aberdeen.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new president of the party allied
with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told the United States Sunday to
keep its ``hands off'' Panama and end what he called immoral
policies toward the country.
   Carlos Duque made the demands in a speech accepting the
presidency of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, the party
tied to Noriega.
   Noriega, head of the Defense Forces and the nation's de facto
ruler, was not at the party meeting.
   Duque called U.S. economic sanctions against Panama and its
backing for the opposition campaign to oust Noriega immoral. He
said his party together with the Defense Forces will fend off the
``gringo invader.''
   Duque also said the Democratic Revolutionary Party will field a
candidate in presidential elections scheduled for May 1989,
although he did not say when it would name its nominee.
   Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking indictments in the United
States, has been rumored to be planning to run for president.
   Duque, a businessman, said it was time the United States
realized it will ``lose its struggle against a noble and dignified
people.''
   He said the Reagan administration ``hasn't been able to bend
us'' despite its ``lies'' and economic sanctions, which he called
``brutal.''
   He called on Nicaraguan business and labor to redouble efforts
to save Panama ``from the economic crisis that is threatening to
ruin our country.''
   The Reagan administration imposed economic sanctions on Panama
and froze Panamanian assets in the United States earlier this year
in a bid to force Noriega to step down. The sanctions have crippled
Panama's economy but have failed to force Noriega's departure.

<TEXT>
   Four Iranian children carrying a large paper
airplane splattered with red paint led about 600 other Iranians
past the U.S. Embassy on Saturday to protest the U.S. downing of an
Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf.
   Marchers shook clenched fists as they passed the embassy in
central London's Grosvenor Square and shouted repeatedly, ``Down
with U.S.A.!''
   Some held banners demanding the withdrawal of U.S. warships from
the Persian Gulf. Others carried life-size photographs of Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Before the marchers started out from Marble Arch in central
London, they said prayers for the victims of the incident July 3 in
which Iran says 290 people died.
   The United States said the warship that shot down the plane
mistook the aircraft for a hostile Iranian fighter jet.
   The march was organized by Iranian students. Scotland Yard, the
London police headquarters, said there were no disturbances and no
arrests were made.

<TEXT>
   Arab governments in the Persian Gulf find
the U.S. naval presence oppressive at times but do not plan to
start opposing it because an American warship shot down an Iranian
airliner, officials said Saturday.
   There also are no signs of a major shift in public opinion in
the week since missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes
destroyed the Iran Air jet over the gulf, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   The incident was ``a very big disaster,'' said Egypt's President
Hosni Mubarak. ``At the same time, I blame Iran because of the
existence of the state of war and because of its refusal to accept
peace efforts.''
   Mubarak, speaking to reporters Cairo after meeting with Jordan's
King Hussein, apparently was referring to the U.N. Security
Council's Resolution 598 calling for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq
war that has often spilled into the gulf. He called on Iran to
accept the resolution ``in order to avoid more disasters.''
   Iran reported Saturday that navy divers pulled five more bodies,
all men, from the gulf. The bodies were taken to the southern
Iranian city of Bandar Abbas for identification. The airliner took
off from the city's airport before it was downed.
   One body was identified as that of Jamshar Morad Ibrahim, a
citizen of the United Arab Emirates, according to an Iranian TV
report monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. Previous Iranian reports said
less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only 150 identified.
Thirty-eight of the passengers were foreigners.
   Some statements by governments and editorial writers criticize
the U.S. action for causing loss of life but generally express the
view that the culprit is the Iran-Iraq war rather than the United
States. The two Persian Gulf neighbors have been at war since
September 1980.
   Public attitudes appear to reflect that sentiment, said editor
Mahbub Jamal Zahedi of the Khaleej Times, a major newspaper in the
United Arab Emirates, just across the southern gulf from Iran.
   Sympathy for Iran's point of view is perhaps stronger in the
Emirates than in any other Arab gulf state. About 150,000 Iranian
citizens and many other ethnic Iranians live in the federation,
which has close commercial ties with Iran.
   ``The widespread feeling is that the tragedy should not have
taken place,'' Zahedi said. ``It would not have taken place if the
war had stopped. As long as the war continues, such things will
happen.''
   Seventeen residents of the Emirates were on the passenger list
of last Sunday's Flight 655 from Bandar Abbas across the Strait of
Hormuz to Dubai.
   Zahedi's newspaper printed a full page, black-bordered ``thanks
for condolences'' ad Saturday signed by a ranking police official
of the Emirates, whose father was among the dead.
   Khaled Abdul Latif Ahmed, a young Kuwaiti staying at a hotel in
Dubai, said the tragedy ``made people in the Emirates very angry.''
When asked whether the U.S. fleet should be withdrawn from the
gulf, he replied: ``No. But maybe there is a problem between Iran
and America.''
   Most editorials have stressed the need to end the war, but some
newspapers took the opportunity to condemn the United States for a
Middle East policy built around support for Israel, the universal
Arab enemy.
   The United States ``downed the whole region decades ago,'' said
Al Khaleej, published in the Sharjah emirate.
   Many Arab officials say the U.S. military commitment has helped
bring stability but they find the Navy's presence sometimes
difficult to bear.
   On Monday, the day after the Iranian plane was shot down, an
Arab diplomat said privately that a broadening U.S. role ``can only
mean more explosive situations.''
   A Western diplomat whose territory includes most of the gulf,
from Kuwait in the north to Oman on the Strait of Hormuz, said most
officials with whom he deals feel the war is to blame for the
disaster.
   ``They are stunned by the tragedy, but they're not blaming the
United States, although they are trying now to distance themselves
from the Americans as much as possible. They are not prepared to
kick Uncle Sam,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   That viewpoint came through in statements by Arab governments,
which avoided direct criticism of Washington.
   ``Continuation of the destructive Iraq-Iran war threatens the
entire region with more tragedies day after day,'' said an official
source in Bahrain, an island state that provides limited port
facilities to the U.S. Navy.
   Kuwait's Foreign Ministry said ``more painful incidents could
take place'' unless the war ends, and Qatar issued a similar
statement.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, which broke relations with Iran this
year after accusing it of terrorism and subversion, was said to
have called for ``vigilance to confront any sudden development.''
His apparent reference was to threats of revenge some Iranian
officials made after the plane was shot down.
   Concern about Iranian retaliation is especially strong in
Kuwait, which has been hit by Iranian missiles and terrorist
bombings blamed on pro-Iran extremists. Iran accuses the sheikdom
of helping Iraq. The United States, at Kuwait's request, has
reflagged 11 Kuwaiti tankers so the Navy can protect them.
   ``They are expecting something dramatic,'' said a Western
diplomat based in Kuwait. ``They think they are the ones to take
the heat. They think American actions have got them in trouble.''

<HEAD>House Subcommittee Investigating Influence-Buying Charges Against
IRS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. House subcommittee is
investigating allegations of attempts to influence senior Internal
Revenue Service officials in Washington and six other cities, a
panel aide says.
   ``The allegations of misconduct concern high-level people at
district and regional office levels,'' Peter Barash, staff director
of the Commerce Consumer and Monetary Affairs subcommittee of the
House Government Operations Committee, told the Lawrenceville-based
Gwinnett Daily News on Friday.
   For seven weeks, subcommittee investigators and the General
Accounting Office have been looking into charges of abuse by senior
staffers in Los Angeles; Cincinnati; Newark, N.J.; San Francisco;
Chicago; and Dallas, as well as Washington, Barash said.
   The investigators also are trying to determine if top officials
at IRS headquarters in Washington failed to act against senior
regional officials who allegedly misused their authority, Barash
said.
   Barash said the subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Doug Barnard,
D-Ga., received a number of allegations in the spring about
misconduct within the agency.
   ``We checked out some things and found out that the allegations
appear at this preliminary stage of the investigation to be true
enough to begin a formal investigation,'' he said. ``It looks like
some people, some top IRS senior staffers, were involved in
misconduct, abusing of their power for private, personal gain or
enrichment.''
   Barnard's subcommittee will conduct hearings by early October on
the results of its investigation, Barash said.
   The staff director described one case in Los Angeles involving a
senior criminal investigator who went to work for Guess Jeans Inc.
after leaving the federal agency.
   ``The allegation with regards to Guess Jeans is it had an IRS
senior employee in Los Angeles under its control and influence and
got this employee to either initiate criminal tax fraud
investigations (against a competing jeans company) or to kill
criminal tax fraud investigations at the behest of Guess Jeans,''
said Barash.
   The Gwinnett Daily News quoted a spokesman for the jeans maker
as saying the company did nothing wrong and has agreed to cooperate
with federal investigators.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bartenders on Saturday approved a
settlement with pub owners over a pay dispute that developed after
the Irish Parliament passed new laws to extend pub hours.
   The laws, approved last month in an effort to accommodate the
tourist industry, came into operation smoothly in the rest of the
country but in Dublin the bartenders demanded extra pay and
threatened to strike Saturday morning.
   The 3,000 union bartenders in the city earn an average $300 a
week and wanted $45 a week more and an extra half day off every two
weeks if they were going to work the new hours, which would
increase their 40-hour work week by an hour.
   Publicans offered a one-time ``goodwill payment'' of $150 to
bartenders with more than six months' service, and an extra $18 a
week.
   Union leaders recommended acceptance of the offer and barmen
approved it by a vote of 628 to 539.
   There are about 750 pubs in the city area _ about 500 of them
employing union members. The rest of the pubs are run by families
and have been operating the new hours.
   The pubs used to close at 11:30 p.m. in summer and 11 p.m. in
winter, Monday through Saturday. Now they can close at midnight in
summer and 11:30 in winter. They get an extra hour Sunday, closing
at 11 instead of 10 p.m.
   The one-hour afternoon closure between 2:30 and 3:30 p.m., in
effect in Dublin and Cork only, also has been eliminated.
   The main aim of the new laws was to answer complaints from the
tourist industry that visitors thought closing time was too early.

<TEXT>
   Residents of this southern Indiana farming
town offer nervous jokes about the 13 dynamite bombs that were
found beneath bridges, behind businesses and two historic buildings.
   The bombs, traced to a theft of dynamite last month in another
Indiana town, were defective and failed to detonate, but the
thought of what might have happened has made an impact on the town
of 6,000.
   Patrons at Donanna's Restaurant kidded each other Friday about
the 300 sticks of dynamite found with clocks and makeshift blasting
caps.
   ``They'll look under a chair and say `Is there a bomb under
here?' and laugh,'' said Forest P. Noland, a manager at the
restaurant.
   But, says Noland, ``it isn't anything to joke about, really.''
   Rewards totaling $10,000 have been offered for information about
the explosives. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
posted the original $5,000 reward Thursday, and the Indiana Arson
Crime Association matched that Friday.
   ``Now anyone who calls stands to gain $10,000, so maybe it will
help,'' said ATF spokesman Joe V. Thurman.
   Thurman said about 35 investigators from his agency, the FBI,
the Army and state police were in the town about 30 miles northwest
of Louisville, Ky.
   On Saturday, Thurman said the dynamite used in the bombs had
been traced to a theft at Mulzer Crushed Stone in English.
   He said the dynamite, which was stolen between June 6 and 13,
also has been linked to a bomb similar to those planted in Salem
that exploded along Indiana 37 about a mile south of English on
July 1. The town of English is about 30 miles southwest of here.
   ``A passing motorist reported some smoke and fire at a roadside
rest area,'' Thurman said. ``It was the same type of device and the
dynamite was from the same theft.'' There have been no arrests in
the theft.
   Three of the dynamite bundles found Tuesday morning detonated
partially, producing smoke and small fires. Authorities closed off
the central business district and disarmed the 10 remaining bombs,
which had been concealed in brown grocery bags and covered with
debris.
   Mayor Frank Newkirk Sr. said the explosives were the work of
terrorists, but others disagree.
   ``I think whoever did it just wanted publicity,'' said Noland.
``If they were serious, they could have rigged at least one of them
to go off, anyway, out of 13.''
   The bombs failed to explode because black powder charges
intended to trigger the dynamite was improperly packed,
investigators said.
   Dynamite is no harder to obtain than a handgun in Indiana since
it is used in road construction, in quarries and in mining. It
requires careful handling, but the techniques are widely known in
the construction and mining trades.
   ``I'm no expert, but you don't need to be a specialist for
something like that,'' said Noland, who also owns a 130-acre farm
outside nearby Pekin.
   Mitch Ferguson, a retired contractor who used explosives in road
construction, noted reports from investigators that the amount of
dynamite involved could have leveled a sizable portion of the
downtown.
   ``They were just lucky that whoever did it didn't know anything
about (black) powder,'' Ferguson said.
   Police have refused to discuss a possible motive, and residents
could point to no community-wide disputes in the town.
   ``I think they're interested in any theory,'' said state Rep.
Frank Newkirk Jr., a former deputy county prosecutor who now has a
private law practice.
   A bomb containing 52 sticks of dynamite was found beneath the
wooden back steps to his office, and Newkirk had a long meeting
with investigators late in the week.
   Newkirk doubted he was the target of the explosives. And the
fact that most of the bombs were placed near government property
might not mean much either, he said.
   ``Often with a crime like this, when you look for some
philosophical explanation, what you find instead is some personal,
selfish explanation,'' he said. ``It's just as likely that this was
done to destroy documents or collect insurance.''
   Police and federal agents set up a command post at Salem High
School and questioned residents door-to-door throughout the week.
Some found the police presence reassuring but wondered what would
happen if authorities left without making an arrest.
   ``I find myself, when I drive down the street, looking in the
faces of the people I pass,'' said Newkirk. ``I'm asking myself `Is
this the kind of person who would do something like that?'''

   A train collided with a truck
loaded with opposition party activists going to vote Saturday, and
at least 16 people were killed and 11 seriously injured, officials
said.
   The accident took place at El Quebrachal, a small town 150 miles
southeast of the provincial capital of Salta. The town's mayor,
Pedro Sandez, said the crash occurred when a flatbed truck collided
with a train at an unmarked rail crossing.
   Thirty people were in the truck, including several children.
Most were opposition Peronist Party activists headed to vote in
primary elections to choose their party's presidential candidate.
   Seven of the injured were taken to a hospital in grave condition
in the nearby town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez, officials said.
   No further details were immediately available.
   The presidential election will be held next year. Last week,
Eduardo Angeloz was chosen the candidate of the governing Radical
Civic Union Party.

   Rain fell Saturday on parts of the parched Midwest, including an
Iowa town where Hopi Indians performed a rain dance the night
before, but elsewhere in the drought region the sky was clear and
dry and temperatures rose as high as 102 degrees.
   Clouds kept temperatures below the 90s across much of the Plains
and the Mississippi Valley, but readings hit 100 in Tennessee,
Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, the National Weather Service said.
   Louisville, Ky., hit a record high of 102. It was the first time
since July 1954 that there were three consecutive days of 100 or
higher readings in Louisville, the weather service said. Other
records were posted in cities from Indiana and Tennessee to New
England.
   Government observers, meanwhile, spent most of Saturday
surveying drought-stricken river basins in central and southeastern
Kentucky. The field work was the immediate result of the executive
order signed Friday by Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, declaring a
statewide water emergency.
   ``The effort this weekend has been to establish valid priorities
for emergency response efforts,'' William C. Burger, who heads the
Kentucky Cabinet's environmental response team, said Saturday. ``We
want to apply our available resources to the areas of greatest
need.''
   In Boston, a hot-weather emergency was declared and two
community centers were opened for anyone over 60 who needed an
air-conditioned escape.
   And while the weather in most of the nation was arid, snowplows
worked nearly four hours clearing a foot of hail from Interstate 25
on the north edge of Colorado Springs on Saturday afternoon, the
Colorado State Patrol said.
   The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issued an ozone warning
because the hot air over the state's metropolitan areas has trapped
pollution.
   ``What's happening is we have a lot of hot, stagnant air sitting
here and it's been sitting here for a while,'' Jennifer Lane Maier,
a spokeswoman for the OEPA, said Friday.
   Cincinnati Mayor Charles Luken declared a heat emergency in his
city, extending the hours of operation at five of the city's
air-conditioned ``cooling centers.''
   Strong thundershowers and gusting winds swept through southern
and central Kansas on Saturday, as well as northwestern Wisconsin
and Iowa.
   ``This is going to help, although I don't think you can call it
a drought-buster,'' said Brian Hahn, forecaster for the National
Weather Service in Des Moines, Iowa. ``You'd need several more days
like this in a row.''
   Several Iowa cities reported more than an inch of rain,
including 1 inch at Audubon, where 16 Hopi Indians performed rain
rituals Friday night.
   ``The miracles are still here, we just have to ask for them,''
said retired farmer Elmer Carlson, who helped organize the
appearance.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms swept through northern
Wisconsin.
   Racine, Wis., Mayor N. Owen Davies urged residents of every
faith to ``take a moment to pray for the end of the drought at
their place of worship'' on Sunday.
   Milwaukee has 30 water trucks operating around the clock to save
the city's trees. At least half of the 30,000 young trees planted
in the past three years at a cost of $8 million will die if they do
not get water, City Forester Bob Skiera said.
   Thunderstorms that moved over Minnesota late in the week
provided the first heavy rain there in several months, the weather
service said. As much as 5 inches fell at Finlayson in central
Minnesota, the weather service said.
   In spite of that, ``We are on the verge of a major disaster in
Minnesota, and it's from north to south and east to west,'' Don
Friedrich, state director of the U.S. Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service, told a legislative hearing Friday.
   If the drought doesn't end ``we are headed for suspension of all
surface water irrigation in the state,'' Ron Nargang, head of the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' water division, told the
lawmakers.
   Much of the Corn Belt is entering the critical pollination stage
when kernels are formed on the corn ears, agriculture experts said.
But heat speeds up the shedding of pollen from corn tassles and
delays the emergence of corn silks, which accept the pollen grains
to form the seed, agronomists say.
   Agronomists at Purdue University in Indiana won't speculate on
potential losses, but say at least 25 percent of that state's $1.2
billion corn crop already has been lost.
   ``It's potentially one of the worst things we've ever seen in
corn,'' said agronomist Robert Nielson, Purdue's top corn expert.
   Experts in Iowa have estimated that half of that state's corn
crop will be lost; Gov. Terry Branstad declared the entire state a
disaster area Friday.
   Corn yields in North Dakota are expected to be cut by about 40
percent, and even with adequate rain through the rest of the
summer, yields could be as low as 56 bushels an acre statewide,
according to Robert Thompson, president of the North Dakota Corn
Growers Association. Last year, the state averaged 96 bushels of
corn per acre.
   ``We'd have to have better than average rainfall to get that 60
percent (yield potential),'' Thompson said. ``If we don't get three
or four inches of rain in the near future, we won't get that.''

<HEAD>Senators Demand Elections: Criticize Presidential Actions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of the Pakistani Senate on
Saturday demanded immediate elections and criticized President Gen.
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq for dissolving the National Assembly and for
dismissing the civilian Cabinet.
   ``President Zia should not play with the constitution,'' Sen.
Khurshid Ahmed said on the opening day of the Senate, the upper
house of the Parliament, which was not dissolved.
   The Senate met for the first time Saturday after Zia dissolved
the National Assembly _ the powerful lower house of the Parliament
_ on May 29.
   Zia also had dismissed his civilian Prime Minister Mohammad Khan
Junejo and his 33-member Cabinet the same day, accusing them of
corruption, incompetence, and failure to speedily introduce Islam
or prevent breakdown of law and order.
   The senators protesting Zia's actions challenged these steps and
charged Zia with ``insulting the entire Parliament,'' and bringing
``parliamentary and democratic institutions into disrepute,'' by
making false allegations of corruption against the assembly members.
   ``In Islam, punishment for false accusations is to be flogged 80
times,'' Sen. Ahmed said while criticizing Zia actions.
   Junejo also has called Zia actions as ``arbitrary'' and accused
the president of ``disrupting the democratic process which was
smoothly under way,'' after eight years of martial law during which
the president ruled the country up to 1985.
   All the senators demanded holding of elections within 90 days of
the dissolution of the assembly as the constitution provides, which
means by Aug. 27.
   Although Zia originally indicated he may hold the polls by 90
days, he has remained silent on the subject and refused to set an
election date so far, in spite of demands by all political parties.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peronist Party's first
presidential primary in four decades Saturday gave La Rioja
provincial Gov. Carlos Menem an upset victory over Buenos Aires
provincial Gov. Antonio Cafiero, officials said.
   Electoral board returns to choose the Peronist candidate for the
1989 presidential election showed the charismatic Menem leading
735,799 votes (53 percent) to Cafiero's 641,163 votes (46.2
percent).
   The remaining percentage went to lesser candidates or nullified
ballots.
   The labor-backed Justicialist Party, more commonly known as the
Peronist Party, is Argentina's main opposition group. It made a
comeback in national elections in September last year after five
years of electoral setbacks, capturing the governorships of 17 of
the 22 provinces.
   The party has been split in recent months over the candidacies
of Menem, a fiery orator, and party president Cafiero, a member of
a reform faction. Observers had given Cafiero, the former economy
minister, a slight edge going into the voting.
   Menem, 53, appeared smiling on television late Saturday.
   ``Of course I'm happy. We won. We ran a good race,'' he said.
   In remarks from a downtown hall in the capital Buenos Aires,
Menem dedicated his victory to ``the poorest people, those who need
it the most.''
   Cafiero, 66, whom Menem described as ``my friend ... a loyal man
(who ran) a dignified campaign,'' went on television later Saturday
for about three minutes to congratulate ``Carlos Menem, the
winner.''
   Complete official results were expected Monday.
   Cafiero said he would support Menem in the presidential
elections, dispelling fears in political circles of a split in the
main opposition party, which is favored to defeat the ruling
Radical Civic Party next year.
   Both candidates had favored declaring a moratorium on the
interest portion of Argentina's huge $53 billion foreign debt. The
upcoming campaign is expected to focus on economic issues in
inflation-plagued Argentina.
   In a related development, a flatbed truck carrying some voters
to the polls collided Saturday afternoon with a train at an
unmarked rail crossing in northern Argentina, killing at least 16
people and seriously injuring about 20 others, police and hospital
officials said.
   The accident occurred as the truck was taking voters to a
polling station in El Quebrachal, a village 150 miles southeast of
Salta.
   Up to 4.1 million card-carrying party members were eligible to
vote in the nationwide internal elections. No other incidents were
reported as voter turnouts of up to 65 percent in some interior
provinces were reported.
   The party, founded in the late 1940s behind the populist,
pro-union tendencies of former President Gen. Juan Peron, mainly
attracts working-class adherents, some of whom beat bass drums
fervently at mass rallies. Its politics range from center-left to
rightist, often defying traditional party definitions.
   The governing Radical Civic Union Party of President Raul
Alfonsin elected its candidate, centrist Cordoba provincial Gov.
Eduardo Angeloz, on July 3. By law, Alfonsin cannot run for
re-election.
   The presidential elections are tentatively scheduled for next
May or June, and the president will be elected to a six-year term
beginning in December.
   Alfonsin's election in 1983 ended a harsh nearly eight-year
military dictatorship during which at least 9,000 suspected
leftists were abducted and vanished without a trace during the
``dirty war'' waged by the military against subversion.

<HEAD>Radioactive Water Released Into Stream At Savannah River Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 360,000 gallons of radioactive water
were released into a stream at the Savannah River Plant,
environmental officials were told Saturday.
   Plant spokesman James Felder, who attributed the release to a
procedural error, said the spill Friday should not affect the
health of the workers or the public around the plant, located in
Aiken County, S.C., across the Savannah River from Augusta.
   South Carolina and Georgia environmental authorities were
notified Saturday morning, although the amounts of the release did
not require notification, The Augusta Chronicle and the Augusta
Herald reported in their combined Sunday editions.
   The water contained two to three millicuries of Cesium-137, a
waste byproduct known to cause cancer. Felder said standards allow
a maximum annual release of 175 millicuries. By the end of May, 50
millicuries had been released at the plant.
   ``It's a very high release for a 12-hour period,'' Felder said.
``But it's well within our guidelines.''
   The contaminated water was expected to reach the Savannah River
about 6:30 p.m. Sunday. Felder said most of Cesium-137 would settle
to the bottom of Four Mile Creek.

   Firefighters cut the final three miles of fire line through a
steep, rocky area on the southwest edge of a fire that stalled
Saturday after burning 16,500 acres in the Black Hills of South
Dakota.
   Meanwhile, a fire that scorched hundreds of acres in a Michigan
state forest forced the evacuation of about 200 people, Wisconsin
firefighters battled several fires in drought-parched areas of the
state, and Utah crews contained a stubborn blaze and hoped to have
it controlled by Sunday.
   Elsewhere:
   _ Firefighters brought the blaze in Wyoming's Shoshone National
Forest under control Saturday afternoon, helped in part by rainy
weather earlier in the week.
   _ Fires that have scorched more than 2,000 acres of Harriman
State Park in New York were contained, a park ranger said.
   _ A single-engine plane crash-landed on a highway in the
foothills behind Palo Alto, Calif., Saturday, triggering a small
brush fire and forcing closure of a five-mile stretch of the
roadway. Sheriff's Sgt. Gary Hoss said the pilot suffered minor
injuries in the incident just above Devil's Canyon.
   _ And firefighters contended with forest fires across eastern
Kentucky as temperatures soared into triple digits, and a Division
of Forestry spokesman called on the governor to consider declaring
a fire emergency in the state.
   In South Dakota, more problems arose when four new fires
started. Some of the 1,200 firefighters at the main fire scene were
pulled away to douse the latest blazes that apparently were started
by lightning Friday night, said Steve Libbey, fire information
officer.
   One of the new fires came within a half-mile of the Blacks Hills
Playhouse, a summer theater that was narrowly missed by the main
fire earlier in the week.
   Only one of the new fires, at Flint Hill west of Edgemont, had
been contained by Saturday afternoon, Libbey said.
   Roads skirting the northwest and northeast corners of
73,000-acre Custer State Park were reopened Saturday, but the park
itself remained closed to the public.
   Thirty families evacuated from an area just outside the western
park boundary were allowed to return home at their own risk, a fire
spokesman said. They had been ordered to leave Friday after flames
jumped Highway 87 on the southwest edge of the fire in the area
around Mount Coolidge.
   The main fire has been burning since Monday night. Fire
officials suspect lightning that ignited the extremely dry forest
in the north-central part of Custer State Park.
   The blaze, named the Galena Fire, is by far the largest fire
ever in the park, but not the biggest in the Black Hills, officials
said.
   In Michigan, residents who live near Clear Lake had to leave
their homes when a fire roared through Au Sable State Forest on
Saturday.
   The fire spread rapidly, burning at least 400 acres with 3{
hours, said John MacGregor of the Michigan Department of Natural
Resources.
   About 100 firefighters were battling the blaze, he said.
   ``We've got a good organization in place and a lot of good
equipment so we're in a good position to hold the fire,'' MacGregor
said.
   Authorities said the cause of the fire was still under
investigation.
   In Wisconsin, three fires near Portage burned a home, an acre of
grass and 26 acres of woods and grass. A sheriff's deputy suffered
minor burns and a firefighter suffered heat exhaustion fighting the
most extensive blaze, about five miles northeast of Portage.
   Portage Fire Chief Rick Trevaskis said the fire was started by a
farmer who was burning trash in violation of the statewide burning
ban.
   The lightning-caused Echo Canyon fire that charred 475 acres of
sagebrush and some aspen trees in Utah was contained Friday night,
said Interagency Fire Center dispatcher Lori Ensley.
   Containment of the Echo Canyon blaze followed recent battles
against a number of fires in Utah, including a 900-acre fire in
Zion National Park and a 3,500-acre fire near the Nevada border.

   Rescue workers removed the last four
victims from the wreckage of a collapsed department store Saturday
and said the death toll was 14, not 16 as feared earlier. Officials
said the disaster might have been caused by a clogged storm drain
on the building's roof.
   ``There is no need to check again. We have checked,
double-checked, triple-checked and quadruple-checked. There are no
more bodies in there,'' said Walter Plitt, head of a heavy
equipment company that supplied some of the machinery used in the
rescue effort.
   Mayor Ygnacio Garza concurred, saying officials were convinced
that the last victim had been found.
   Two adults and four children were rescued from the massive pile
of rubble Friday, but at least 47 were injured in addition to the
14 who died.
   In all, four bodies were recovered Saturday. Confusion about the
death toll continued until the final victim, Leticia Silva de
Carrera, was removed from the debris late Saturday afternoon.
   Officials had said they believed that the body of Mrs. Carrera's
4-year-old son, Israel, was with her under the rubble. But they
later determined that Israel's body was one of those that had been
found earlier in the day. They had also thought they saw another
victim near Mrs. Carrera's body, but when her body was recovered
this proved not to be the case, they said.
   Clogged drainage holes on the building's flat roof could have
contributed to the collapse by allowing rain water to accumulate
and possibly overload the building, said Kermit Cromack, tax
assessor-collector for Cameron County.
   ``If you were the owner of the store, how many times would you
go up and see if the drainage pipes were clogged, especially if
it's a three-story building?'' Cromack asked.
   Tony Yzaguirre Jr., a city tax assessor-collector, said the
building was inspected earlier this year by the fire department, as
it is annually.
   Minimal construction standards contributed to the tragedy, other
officials charged.
   ``That old store was nothing more than a stack of blocks,''
Cromack said. ``This was bound to happen sooner or later.''
   The third floor of the 20-year-old building was added in 1975
and Cromack said the building's construction was average for one
that age in the area, explaining ``we don't build as heavy as they
do elsewhere because we don't have snow.''
   ``The roof is not designed to carry all that weight,''
Brownsville building inspector Fernando Romero told The Dallas
Morning News. ``It's a tragedy and one that may happen again at any
time.''
   Bernard Levin, owner of the Amigo Store, could not immediately
be reached for comment. A woman who answered the phone at his home
said she was a friend and she didn't know where he was or when he
would return.
   Garza said investigations were being launched by the city, the
building's insurance company and the federal Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
   Garza said the rainstorm, which poured 2 inches in less than 30
minutes, may have been a factor, but that other factors also may
have played a role.
   ``We have a report from witnesses that a bolt of lightning
struck behind the building and hit some transformers and perhaps
knocked them down,'' Garza said.
   Rescue workers had concentrated their efforts Saturday on two
sites in the rear of the building, where U.S. Border Patrol
drug-and people-sniffing dogs indicated spots where people, living
or dead, might be trapped. Workers formed human chains to remove
debris basket by basket.
   Rescuers were removing chunks of concrete, broken cinderblocks,
shattered glass, merchandise and splintered tables.
   ``By this time tomorrow morning, the building won't be there
anymore,'' Terry Ray, a construction foreman leading the digging
effort, said Saturday. ``We're no longer allowing any tunneling.
We're in the process of taking apart the building layer by layer.''
   By late afternoon, all but about 10 percent of the debris had
been removed.
   Medical workers forced volunteers and rescue workers to take a
break because of the 90-degree heat and high humidity.
   ``We're losing more fluids now than we're taking in,'' said
police Sgt. Dean Poos.
   Alan Mesh, a demolition expert with Ferromar Inc. of Brownsville
who has assisted in the rescue since Thursday, said workers had to
tunnel through three layers of two-inch-thick concrete before
reaching the six survivors.
   Mesh said the store's safe acted like a tent pole and kept the
main beam from collapsing on the six.

<HEAD>Excavation Unearths 18th Century Artifacts Near Independence Hall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Excavation at a construction site near
Independence Hall has stopped while archaeologists examine a trove
of pottery, glass and other artifacts unearthed from an
18th-century privy.
   Archaeologists said they believe the site was honeycombed with
other shafts into which the debris of everyday life in colonial
Philadelphia was tossed, creating over the decades a layered time
capsule of the 18th century.
   Athough the extent of the find still is unknown, archaeologists
are excited.
   ``I haven't seen the artifacts. I just went down there and
eyeballed the privy, and I was very much impressed with it. This
could be quite significant,'' said John Cotter, former chief
archaeologist for the National Park Service's Eastern Region and
curator emeritus of American historical archaeology at the
University of Pennsylvania.
   On Wednesday National Park Service employees alerted excavators
to the presence of the privies _ brick-lined shafts built beneath
outhouses.
   Eight privies and potentially thousands of artifacts in them
were destroyed by the latest digging at the site, said Robert
Giannini, assistant curator of cermics and glass for the park. But
the top of one crumbling, dirt-filled brick shaft was saved when
digging was halted Thursday.
   A 140-bed hotel and 442-car garage, to be operated by Omni
International, is being built at the site by developer Kevin F.
Donohue.
   He agreed to stop the excavation after park service employees
saw the pottery shards and the privy shafts' brick linings being
lifted out by the construction crew.
   Philadelphia Historical Commission members and the developer
plan to meet to figure out how to remove the artifacts and allow
construction to continue, said Richard Tyler, the commission's
preservation officer.
   Cotter said some privy shafts of the 18th century were actually
deep wells illegally used as privies. The area was residential in
the 18th century, but in the 19th century was developed into a
banking area. Construction of a bank on the site probably caused
the razing of the outhouse structures and the destruction of the
top of the shafts, Cotter said.

   For some of those inside the Amigo
Store, the discount department store was merely a refuge from a
powerful rainstorm.
   Some of the people killed when the store's roof collapsed had
never shopped at the store along a busy commercial section
downtown, blocks from the Mexico border. They ducked inside the
three-story building for shelter from the 2 inches of rain that
fell in a half hour Thursday afternoon, relatives said.
   Adrian Davila Silva, 15, vividly recalls the moments before and
after the collapse, saying his family never had shopped at the
store.
   ``We were just walking down the street, but we couldn't walk
anymore because it was raining too hard,'' he said. ``We all got
into the store.
   ``We were five meters inside the store and I was near my cousin,
Charlene, and then suddenly there was something like an explosion.
It got dark and the walls fell,'' said Davila.
   ``I saw some light and that's where we climbed out of there,''
he said. ``I expected to see destruction everywhere when I got out,
but it was only this building.''
   About 100 people were in the store when the 30-ton roof
collapsed. At least 14 people were killed and 47 injured. Rescue
workers continued clearing debris late Saturday afternoon but said
they believed they had recovered all the bodies.
   Officials had said earlier that 16 people died in the collapse,
but revised the figure downward Saturday afternoon.
   Six survivors were found Friday underneath tons of concrete,
twisted steel and broken glass that showered down on them when the
roof collapsed.
   ``It doesn't sound like we will find anybody else alive,'' said
police spokesman Sgt. Dean Poos.
   Relatives of those trapped had stayed near the scene and prayed,
including Dr. Jose Carrera of Matamoros, Mexico, whose wife,
Leticia, and their 4-year-old son, Israel, had been among the
missing. Their 8-year-old daughter Denise was rescued Friday and
was recuperating at home.
   ``She is doing fine,'' Carrera had said. ``But she is just sad
that her mother is still in there. We are praying that they will
find her and my boy alive.''
   But the Carrera family's worst fears were confirmed Saturday
when the son's body was found, and later in the day Mrs. Carrera's
body was the 14th to be discovered.
   Services were held Friday for one of the victims, Bertha C.
Musquiz, 77, and two mother-daughter funerals were held Saturday
afternoon in Matamoros.
   Among those laid to rest Saturday was 19-year-old Maria Dolores
Acosta Reyes, who had been deaf since birth, and her mother,
Antonia Reyes de Acosta.
   Marty Price, pastor of the Brownsville Baptist Deaf Church,
described Miss Acosta as ``very sweet, very likable. She was very
easy to get to know and she had a lot of friends. A lot of the
children here are expressing some surprise to a lot of this. They
can't understand why she had to die.''
   Among the rescue workers was Jose Hinojosa Hernandez, 35, an
architect from Monterrey, Mexico, who helped in the rescue effort
during the Mexico City earthquakes in September 1985.
   ``The mayor wanted to thank me for coming, but I am thankful to
him because I am working,'' said Hernandez, who was granted a visa
waiver by U.S. Customs officials.
   ``I like working because I know someone is down there waiting
for me,'' he said. ``Whenever I go to a rescue, I know I might not
return.''

   The government has welcomed Vietnam's
willingness to discuss the problem of Vietnamese boat people with
other countries.
   A Hong Kong government statement Friday said the British Embassy
in Hanoi has received an invitation for government officials in
this British colony to visit Vietnam to discuss the issue of the
boat people.
   The statement said the Hong Kong authorities will respond
postively to the invitation but gave no other details.
   It would be very useful to discuss the ``problem with the
Vietnamese authorities and seek their cooperation in stopping the
ouflow (of boat people) and in repatriating those who are not
geninue refugees,'' the statement added.
   In a broadcast made available in Bangkok Friday, Hanoi radio
quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that while Vietnam
was ``striving to stop illegal evacuees,'' a number were still
attempting to flee the country.
   ``Vietnam with its humanitarian spirit and mutual understanding
is ready to exchange bilateral views with countries and
international organizations concerned to resolve this problem,''
Hanoi radio quoted the spokesman as saying.
   There are more than 16,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong.
   In a new policy announced last month, the Hong Kong government
regards all arriving Vietnamese refugees as illegal immigrants
unless they can prove they are fleeing Vietnam because of political
or religious persecution.
   Those found to be illegal immigrants are housed in detention
centers and face repatriation to Vietnam.

   Eleven-year-old pilot Chris Marshall took off
from New York Saturday on a trip to Europe, just like his hero,
Charles Lindbergh _ but with a few stops and a grown-up co-pilot.
   Bad weather and a thorough mechanical inspection of his Mooney
252 two-seater delayed the takeoff from La Guardia Airport until 5
p.m.
   ``I want to show all the kids in North America that if I can do
this trip, then they can achieve their dreams too,'' Chris said
after arriving at his first stop along the way, Montreal.
   He arrived in New York on Friday evening after a disconcerting
moment when the electrical system shut down for 10 seconds during
his approach.
   Chris landed safely, though, and all systems were go Saturday _
onboard video cameras were suspected of having drained the
batteries on Friday.
   Chris, of Oceano, Calif., has flown from San Diego to Texas to
St. Louis to New York. He plans stops in Montreal, Greenland and
Iceland on his way to Paris.
   Though space was at a premium because of emergency gear required
for flights over the North Atlantic, Chris made room for his
stuffed bear, outfitted with goggles, named ``Charles Lindbeargh.''
   The fifth-grader, the son of a commercial pilot, is also
accompanied by Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham, 46, a retired Miramar
Naval Air Station, Calif., commander and pilot in the Vietnam War.
   Cunningham sits in the pilot's seat in the two-seat craft.
Chris' seat is boosted to window-level by a foam cushion. But Chris
has done all of the flying, Cunningham said. The boy's flight time
is limited to less than eight hours at a stretch.
   Chris first took the controls of a plane at age 4, and began
flying with an instructor at age 7.
   Last year, he became the youngest flier to cross the United
States. Tony Aliengena, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., broke the record in April by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris said this trip would make him the world's youngest
transatlantic pilot.
   Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, then to New York
City before completing his history-making solo flight across the
Atlantic Ocean to Paris in 1927. The non-stop flight took 33{ hours.

<HEAD>Report: BI Bomber Beset By Design Flaws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New tests show that the B1 bomber's electronic
warfare system has design flaws that could prevent it from reaching
the Air Force's planned capabilities for the warplane, according to
a published report.
   The Washington Post, in its Sunday editions, said the flaws
detected in the tests could force the Pentagon to reroute possible
bombing runs through the Soviet Union in the event of nuclear war.
   The newspaper cited an internal congressional document written
by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., who
received a classified Air Force briefing late last week on the
problems, and Pentagon sources.
   ``The plane was designed to be capable of a nuclear attack
against the Soviet Union,'' Aspin said. ``It is now called into
question whether it will ever be able to do that mission in the way
it was advertised.''
   The Air Force said ``the existing system was discovered to be
incapable of meeting the ... specification requirements.''
   Aspin was in Wisconsin for the weekend and could not be reached
for comment by The Associated Press. Pentagon spokeswoman Capt.
Nancy Laluntas had no comment on the report.
   Air Force officials said the tests found that parts of the
plane's electronic countermeasures system _ designed to help
protect the low-flying, penetrating aircraft on its most critical
bombing missions _ does not work and cannot be corrected without
major changes, the newspaper said.
   Aspin, who has been a critic of the Air Force's management of
the B1 program, said the test results were a major setback for the
$28 billion bomber program.
   The B1 bomber's history has been beset with controversy. The
Pentagon began production of the B1, but former President Carter
killed the program, saying it was too costly and was made
unnecessary by development of ``Stealth'' bombers designed to make
detection difficult.
   President Reagan revived the B1, calling it a critical leg of
his strategic plan, and won congressional funding for 100 planes by
vowing to keep a ceiling on the price.
   Since the first bombers became operational in the fall of 1986,
the plane has been plagued by problems ranging from its flight
controls to its terrain-hugging radar.
   Aspin sent committee members a memorandum stating that the
recently completed tests, carried out by the Air Force and Eaton,
the electronic countermeasures system's builder, revealed
``limitations within the current system architecture'' that will
``prevent the B1 ECM from ever achieving full operational
capability,'' the newspaper said.
   The architecture ``isn't any good and ... it's back to the
drawing board,'' he said.

   Sentimental thieves on Saturday returned a

   Mrs. Elena Torresan made a televised appeal on Antenna Tre

15-year-daughter Nadia, who was killed in a car accident last year.
   ``We're sending you the treasured possessions of Nadia. Next
time take better care of them,'' the thieves said in a message sent
with the jewelry to the network at Treviso, about 19 miles west of
Venice.
   Mrs. Torresan had said about $440 and other precious items were
stolen, but she was only interested in getting back the ring and
bracelet with Nadia's name engraved on them.
   But the thieves disputed her version of the story.
   ``Don't say that we took the money, because it's not true,''
they said in the message. ``Greetings. Terribly sorry.''

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
will return home Monday and his work load will be determined by the
progress of his terminal liver cancer, the government said.
   ``The operation of the government will be left to his
judgment,'' Vice President Rodolfo Castillo Claramount told a news
conference Friday. ``The president's course of action will be
determined by the evolution of his illness. Only when he is back
will we be able to resolve this uncertainty.''
   Castillo has been acting president since Duarte went to the
United States for treatment May 31,. He said the president will be
discharged Saturday from Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington, D.C.
   He said Duarte, 62, would rest Sunday and meet with President
Reagan on Monday before flying to El Salvador on the same U.S. Air
Force hospital plane that took him to Washington. He denied local
news reports that Duarte had decided to resign soon after returning.
   Duarte is undergoing chemotherapy, which is often debilitating.
   Salvadoran officials say he must return to Washington at least
once in the coming months to continue the treatment, which is
intended to slow the cancer's advance. Doctors have given him 18
months to live.
   Communications Minister Roberto Viera told the news conference
reports of Duarte's impending resignation ``are the work of
political sectors that want to give the impression that there's a
power vacuum and division within the government.''

   Iran's ambassador tried
to cool the tempers of mourners at an embassy memorial service for
the 290 people killed when a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian
airliner.
   ``Imam Khomeini becomes the inheritor on earth of any one of us
who is unjustly killed, and only he has the right to decide when
and how to take revenge for those innocent victims,'' Ambassador
Mustafa Foumeni Haeri told hundreds of mourners in the embassy
grounds late Thursday.
   ``Let's not take any hasty action,'' he said in Farsi, the
Iranian language.
   After an hour of weeping conducted by two poets trained in the
mourning ceremony, the crowd chanted: ``Khomeini, Khomeini, we
await your orders! Long life to you, death to Reagan!''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is the supreme religious guide for
Iranians and leader of the fundamentalist Islamic revolution that
ousted the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February 1979.
   Haeri's appeal for calm coincided with the mood of statements by
Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's military commander and parliament
speaker. He told a prayer meeting Friday Iran would not seek
revenge for destruction of the airliner.
   ``The United States is trying to push us to commit the same
crime ... but if we did that the world would turn against us,''
Rafsanjani said. ``That is why we do not push to take revenge. Wise
people understand why we do not take revenge.''
   About 150,000 Iranians live in the United Arab Emirates, across
the southern Persian Gulf from Iran. The memorial service was held
in a mosque attached to the new embassy. Its Persian arches were
festooned with anti-American slogans.
   The ambassador said: ``The mode and style of the revenge will
not be such that the world would condemn it and thus (we) lose the
international sympathy with Iran over the Airbus victims.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators failed to
reach a new grain agreement in a third round of talks which ended
here Friday, Alan F. Holmer, the head of the U.S. team, announced.
   Under a five-year agreement that expires on Sept.30, the Soviets
are committed to buying 9 million tons of U.S. grain a year,
including a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn.
   Holmer, who is deputy U.S. trade representative, said Friday,
``There remain differences on four major areas in the negotiations.
That involves quantities of grain, the pricing of grain, the access
of Soviet ships to U.S. ports and also expanding Soviet exports to
the United States.''
   He refused to say if Moscow wants to decrease its annual
purchasing total.
   The drought in the United States was not a significant issue in
the discussions, Holmer said in reply to a question.
   He said that Thomas Kay, administrator of the Foreign
Agricultural Service, explained to the Soviets ``why we have ample
stocks and production more than meet U.S. domestic needs and export
commitments.''
   ``There are a number of signficiant issues where we would like
to have changes and where they would like to have changes,'' Holmer
said, but added, ``I sense a strong desire on both sides for a new
agreement.''
   The Vienna talks lasted two days. Previous negotiating rounds
took place in Washington in March and in London in May.
   Holmer told reporters no new talks were scheduled, but he
expected negotiations to resume early in September.
   A U.S. delegation official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
put the value of present annual grain sales to the Soviet Union at
about $1.5 billion.
   Holmer said he hoped that before the Soviet negotiations chief,
J. N. Chumakov, goes on vacation on July 25, ``we will know when
and where and whether there will be another round of discussions.''
   Holmer said the Vienna meeting had been useful and ``we made
considerable progress in a number of areas. ... But differences
still remain.''
   The two sides now are now at a stage where they need to review
their positions with their governments, said Holmer, who met
reporters at his hotel.

   The Duchess of York, who is eight months pregnant,
escaped injury Friday when her chauffeured Jaguar struck an
oncoming car on a highway 20 miles outside London, police and
Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident involving the former Sarah Ferguson occurred on a
section of the M40, a busy western highway into London. Part of the
road was closed for repairs, police said.
   A police bodyguard was driving the duchess' Jaguar, and she
continued the journey in an accompanying police car, Buckingham
Palace said.
   The 28-year-old duchess is married to Prince Andrew, the second
son of Queen Elizabeth II. She is expecting their first child.
   Thames Valley police said later in a statement that the driver
of the other car involved was a 31-year-old financial consultant
from Cardiff in Wales.
   They did not identify him by name, but said he was taken to
Newbury police station near the scene of the incident. They said
the officers involved formally submitted a report accusing him of
careless driving and failing to stop after an accident, with a view
to possible prosecution.
   Police said he took an alcohol test which proved negative. He
was later allowed to leave the police station.
   Police said the car in which the duchess had been riding
suffered a punctured front tire and other slight damage.
   The duchess' pregnancy has undergone other health scares since
she fell while skiing in the French alps last March, when she was
four months pregnant.

<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the International Monetary Fund
cautioned participating banks on Friday that failure to upgrade aid
to the debtor nations would slow their financial growth.
   ``Unless the banks do more to support adjustment efforts of
middle-income counties, the notion that our debt strategy is a
collaborative one oriented to growth will not pass serious
scrutiny,'' Michel Camdessus said.
   ``Indeed, it will prevent the resumption of an adequate rate of
growth, and all sides will lose,'' he said in a speech prepared for
a meeting of the United Nations' Economic and Social Council in
Geneva.
   Camdessus endorsed agreements between the debtor nations and
creditors for new arrangements to reduce the estimated $1.2
trillion debt of certain Third World. The nations with the largest
debts are in Latin America _ Brazil, Mexico and Argentina _ where
U.S. banks are the largest lenders.
   He expressed concern over difficulties in developing loan
packages for those governments trying to adjust to their
international debt problems. Such packages usually include loans by
the fund itself, by commercial banks and by intergovernmental
lenders like the World Bank.
   Adjustments required in return for the loans generally include
austerity programs that debtor governments find difficult.
   Camdessus said programs to adjust debtor countries to a better
handling of their funds will in many cases have costs in the short
run but will eventually help their citizens and particularly the
poor.
   ``The poor would almost certainly suffer much more in the
absence of corrective action,'' he said, noting that ``the poor can
be protected, at least to some degree by compensatory measures.''
   Camdessus noted that some adjustment measures are of immediate
help to some poor people, such as increased prices for farm
products that help the poor in rural areas.

<TEXT>
   A Montreal police officer who shot and killed an
unarmed black teen-ager last year, raising a storm of protest from
the city's black community, was fired from the force Friday by
Police Chief Roland Bourget.
   Bourget told reporters he accepted last month's recommendation
by a police disciplinary committee that Constable Allan Gosset, a
16-year veteran of the force, be dismissed for negligence in the
arrest and death of 19-year-old Anthony Griffin last November.
   The committee said Gosset, 38, pointed his gun at Griffin
``without justification,'' then fired, killing him with a single
bullet to the forehead.
   Gosset shot Griffin outside a police station after the youth
bolted from custody. He obeyed an order to stop but was shot as he
turned to face Gosset.
   Gosset said the gun went off accidentally. He was suspended from
his job and charged with manslaughter. An all-white jury acquitted
him in February but the prosecution has appealed the verdict, as
Canadian law allows.
   Protests among Montreal's 120,000 blacks prompted Quebec Justice
Minister Herbert Marx to order inquiries by the Quebec Police
Commission and Human Rights Commission.
   The police commission concluded June 9 that Gosset was
``negligent, thoughtless and lacking in vigilance and judgment''
but found no evidence the shooting was racially motivated. Both the
commission and the police department's internal disciplinary
committee recommended Gosset's dismissal.
   Montreal has six blacks among its 4,481 police officers.
   Gosset and a policewoman arrested Griffin after a taxi driver
complained that a customer refused to pay a fare. A identity check
showed Griffin was wanted on breaking and entering charges.
   Gosset and his lawyer, Serge Menard, spent two hours with
Bourget on Friday in an effort to prevent the dismissal. The police
officer's union, the Montreal Police Brotherhood, pledged to fight
for his reinstatement.

   The United States agreed Saturday to

   The agreement was initialed in a ceremony by visiting U.S.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and his Thai counterpart Siddhi
Savetsila.
   The funds, to be used to help some 300,000 Thais in 412
villages, bring to $42 million the total amount Washington has
provided since 1980 to help the frontier villagers, the embassy
said.
   The funds are to be used to construct reservoirs and irrigation
systems, rural access roads and public health facilities in the

   Fighting between Vietnamese and Cambodian guerrilla forces
frequently spills into Thailand and border clashes between the
Thais and Laotians have flared periodically since communist forces
triumphed in that country in 1975.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on
Friday repeated a Kremlin proposal to withdraw the Red Army from
all foreign territory by the year 2000, apparently ruling out any
imminent pullout of Russian troops from Czechoslovakia and other
Soviet bloc countries.
   The Soviet government chief told Western reporters such moves
could come only in the context of a general withdrawal _ involving
other nations as well as the Soviet Union.
   He also seemed to dash hopes for any rehabilitation soon of
Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist Party leader in
Czechoslovakia.
   His exchanges with the reporters were often acrimonious.
   Ryzhkov confirmed that at the recent Communist Party conference,
Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev stressed the need for
``socialism with a human face.''
   That phrase was used to describe Dubcek's liberal ``Prague
spring'' of 1968, which provoked a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion
in August of that year and cost Dubcek his job as party chief here.
   Western reporters asked Ryzhkov, who attended a three-day
economic conference that ended Thursday, whether the time had not
come for Dubcek to be rehabilitated.
   He replied: ``The rehabilitation of Dubcek, that is a question
for Czechoslovakia. I do not intend to deal with the internal
problems of Czechoslovakia. As far as I know the Czechoslovak party
does not intend to deal with that.''
   Dubcek, now 66, said in an Austrian Television interview
broadcast Thursday that the current leadership in Prague should
adopt Gorbachev's reforms. Most are similar to reforms Dubcek
introduced here 20 years ago.
   Red Army units are stationed in several Soviet bloc countries,
including Czechoslovakia.
   Ryzhkov said his government feels no armies should be on foreign
territory _ U.S., British or Soviet.
   ``Our proposal is this: let us take out all the armies,'' he
said. ``The armies in Czechoslovakia are part of the Warsaw Pact
armies. Let us agree on a radical solution in the West and in the
East.''
   On the theme of ``socialism with a human face,'' Ryzhkov said:
``Socialism must work for man. All our deeds and our reforms must

   ``A great step has been taken toward democratization, toward
glasnost (openness), and that is not possible without man.''
   A Soviet journalist complained about lack of information during
the conference of COMECON, the Soviet bloc equivalent of the
European Economic Community.
   Ryzhkov said he agreed and the practice should be changed
``fundamentally'' because ``95 percent of our the questions
discussed are not in any way secret.''
   He expressed hope the next session in Sofia, Bulgaria would be
different because ``we really have nothing to hide.''
   In reference to communiques issued after Soviet bloc meetings,
which rarely reveal differences of opinion, Ryzhkov declared: ``It
is useless to say that 10 countries have the same opinion. This is
naive.''

   Police Friday began arresting 135 people
indicted on more than 2,000 felony charges resulting from an
undercover investigation that brought in 380 cars valued at more
than $4 million, authorities said.
   ``We worked 12- to 14-hour days buying cars and returning them
to the insurance companies,'' said Detective Thomas Del Regno of
the Cleveland Police Department.
   The rented garage the undercover operation used held only six
cars, so officers had to turn the vehicles over to insurance
companies quickly, Del Regno said.
   The 16-month undercover operation netted stolen cars from 50
cities as far away as Pennsylvania and Michigan, he said. Cleveland
has one of the 10 highest auto theft rates in the country, he added.
   Del Regno said police arrested 45 to 50 people Friday and served
arrest warrants against 20 other who are already behind bars on
other charges. Arrests are expected to continue during the weekend.
   Those arrested were charged with receiving stolen property and
possession of criminal tools, Cuyahoga County assistant prosecutor
Mary Haas said.
   Two people who allegedly sold police more than 50 cars each face
nearly 100 counts. ``The total number of charges is well over
2,000, but I really haven't kept track,'' she said.
   Del Regno said two undercover police officers set up the
operation by contacting alleged thieves through an informant who
``let it be known that if they came across any cars, we were
available.''
   He said police, who videotaped their car deals in three
Cleveland parking lots, never had to solicit business.
   Thieves often came to sell cars within hours of stealing them,
Del Regno said, ``sometimes even before people knew their cars were
stolen.''
   He said most cars came from young independents known as
``rippers'' who were only interested in ``a quick buck,'' but the
large number of cars some sellers turned over made police suspect
the involvement of several car theft rings.

<HEAD>Inflation Reaches 41.3 Percent for First Half of 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 41.3 percent for the
first half of 1988, the business daily El Financiero reported
Friday.
   It tabulated the figures from the Bank of Mexico's announcement
that inflation rose 2 percent in June, slightly above the 1.9
percent increase in May.
   El Financiero's report noted that despite an increase in June,
figures for both months were the lowest registered since November
1981.
   Inflation has been reduced by an Economic Solidarity Pact
designed by the government in December and endorsed by business and
labor. Consumer prices hit a record 159.2 percent last year.
   President Miguel de la Madrid announced the program after
officials became worried that Mexico was on the verge of spiraling
into hyperinflation, a problem that has plagued other Latin
American countries.
   Critics say the pact was intended to artificially control
inflation before Wednesday's general elections.
   The president concludes his six-year term on Nov. 30, with his
successor virtually certain to be Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party that has governed Mexico since
1929.
   The budget and planning secretary, Pedro Aspe, said Wednesday
that it will be up to the next administration to decide if the pact
continues past November.
   He told reporters that the agreement remains in effect at least
through August and that its status for the last three months of de
la Madrid's term won't be determined until the middle of next month.
   A Bank of Mexico report issued late Thursday said a beef
shortage in turn prompted increases in prices of chicken and pork
and so contributed to higher prices, as did a longer than usual dry
season that caused increases in fruit and vegetable prices.
   Among other factors in June's consumer price rises were
residential rents, which were 4.3 percent higher and represented
the largest single increase, the central bank said. Prices on basic
foods and other essentials rose .4 percent.
   Of the 35 cities checked, the highest increases were 4.3 percent
in Zamora, in western Michoacan state, and 2.5 percent in Toluca,
40 miles west of Mexico City.
   The bank's report said the solidarity pact ``continues being
successful in holding down the inflationary process.''
   A key component of the inflation-fighting program is a freeze on
the minimum wage, prices of government-regulated goods and services
and the exchange rate of the peso currency.

   Sixty-four men survived the Piper
Alpha oil rig fire by leaping into the burning sea in the dark, but
they had to leave behind more than 100 colleagues trapped and
screaming for air in the inferno.
   ``I am one of the lucky ones,'' Harry Calder said in an
interview Friday. ``I am pretty sore, I am badly bruised and my
hands are burned. But at least I'm alive. I have lost a lot of
friends.''
   Seventeen bodies have been found and 166 men are presumed dead
in the North Sea oil field where the rig exploded Wednesday night.
   At least 100 men died screaming for help, trapped in their
sleeping quarters after surviving the first explosion, said Calder,
a 35-year-old helicopter landing officer.
   The workers were in the smoke-filled galley of the platform,
which was plunged into darkness when the emergency lighting failed,
he said in an interview Friday.

   The Aegis air defense system, used by the
cruiser Vincennes last week to track and shoot down an Iranian
passenger jet, may not have been adequately tested before it was
deployed, according to a classified review by a congressional
watchdog agency.
   The General Accounting Office study concluded that the $1
billion system has not proven its ability to discriminate among
targets, said congressional sources who have seen the document.
They spoke Friday on condition they not be named.
   The GAO review started last year and did not mention last week's
destruction of Iran Air flight 655 that killed all 290 people
aboard. The Vincennes fired at the airliner after mistaking it for
an Iranian F-14.
   Pentagon officials have said the Aegis system was not
malfunctioning. A ``minor degradation'' of the Aegis radar was
repaired before the ship entered the Persian Gulf last month, they
said.

   A judge's order giving Oliver L. North broader
access to secret government documents for his defense strongly
raises the possibility he won't be tried on the main charges of the
Iran-Contra indictment.
   But the order issued Friday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell clears the way for the fired White House aide to go to trial
at least on charges he lied to cover up his activities and
personally gained from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The judge's order scheduling the trial for Sept. 20 set the
stage for the proceeding to take place in the middle of the fall
presidential campaign.
   In addition to fixing the trial date, Gesell ruled that North is
entitled to use highly classified documents that might show the
covert activities that are the basis of the Iran-Contra conspiracy
charge were authorized by the Reagan administration.
   The judge noted that some highly sensitive portions of documents
in the prosecution's case that government security experts want
deleted ``tended to exonerate North of guilt on certain charges.''

   The Legal Services Corp. is defending its
chairman against congressional allegations that he improperly used
government funds for presidential politics, personal business and
to help destroy the agency.
   The corporation, in a prepared statement issued late Friday,
said it has uncovered no evidence ``that would lend credence to
insinuations of misappropriation'' by W. Clark Durant III.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., outlined the allegations and
called for the resignation of Durant, who has served as chairman of
the agency's board since December 1984 and was an adviser to Rep.
Jack Kemp's failed presidential campaign.
   ``He's been undermining the Legal Services Corporation by
personal and political activities ... at the expense of the
taxpayers,'' Morrison charged.
   Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on courts, civil liberties and the
administration of justice, agreed that the evidence appears to show
``significant improprieties in the financial management of the
corporation.''

   Arab governments in the Persian Gulf find
the U.S. naval presence oppressive at times but do not plan to
start opposing it because an American warship shot down an Iranian
airliner, diplomats said Saturday.
   There also are no signs of a major shift in public opinion in
the week since missiles fired by the cruiser USS Vincennes
destroyed the Iran Air jet over the gulf, killing all 290 people
aboard.
   Iran reported Saturday that navy divers pulled five more bodies,
all men. The bodies were taken to the southern Iranian city of
Bandar Abbas for identification. The airliner took off from the
city's airport before it was downed.
   One body was identified as that of Jamshar Morad Ibrahim, a
citizen of the United Arab Emirates, according to an Iranian TV
report monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus. Previous Iranian reports said
less than 200 bodies had been recovered and only 150 identified.
Thirty-eight of the passengers were foreigners.

   Leading members of Congress are restive, their concern

   ``The United States has unilaterally assumed the role of

comrade 50 years after Josef Stalin had him shot as a spy for

   Retrieving Bukharin's memory from disgrace is part of the effort

became Stalin's victims after helping lead the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution and form the Soviet state.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the Party Control Committee

old Bolshevik, Alexei I. Rykov, and 14 other people.
   Millions of Soviet citizens heard the announcement on state

   As New Yorkers sweltered through temperatures in
the 90s last week, some of their favorite beaches were vacant _
except for a few men and women who picked through tidal debris.
   The beachcombers were not looking for shells. Syringes, blood
vials and other waste had washed up at Jones Beach, Robert Moses
State Park and other locations along 25 miles of Long Island shore.
The workers were enlisted to comb the closed beaches for additional
items of waste.
   Although at first the debris was thought to be hospital waste,
federal and state officials concluded on Friday the debris
resembled household and boating garbage. Most of the beaches were

   The heat wave in much of the country is
pushing up concentrations of ozone, a major air pollutant, over big
cities to levels sometimes not seen for a decade.
   ``We are having an absolutely horrendous summer,'' commented
Bill Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air
Pollution Program Administrators Association, on Friday.
   Ozone prompted air pollution advisories in Chicago every day
last week and caused standards to be violated in Vermont for the
first time in recent memory.
   Several states and cities warned people with lung problems to
curtail activities and stay inside during the afternoon. New York
had a statewide advisory on Friday.
   The new peaks come at a time when the Environmental Protection
Agency is considering whether new ozone standards are needed
because of unexpected lung damage under certain conditions.

   Attorney General Edwin Meese III was ``closely

pipeline and gave conflicting accounts about whether he knew of an
alleged bribery scheme connected with the project, according to an
independent counsel's report.
   The sealed report, portions of which were obtained by The New

White House about the pipeline, and reveals that a sensitive memo
discussing financial guarantees for the project is missing from
Meese's files.
   The report makes no recommendation that Meese be prosecuted but
is said to raise numerous instances of questionable conduct and to
provide indications that Meese may have known about the plan to pay

   Residents of this southern Indiana farming
town offer nervous jokes about the 13 dynamite bombs that were
found beneath bridges, behind businesses and two historic buildings.
   The bombs were defective and failed to detonate, but the thought
of what might have happened has made an impact on the town of 6,000.
   Patrons at Donanna's Restaurant kidded each other Friday about
the 300 sticks of dynamite found with clocks and makeshift blasting
caps.
   ``They'll look under a chair and say `Is there a bomb under
here?' and laugh,'' said Forest P. Noland, a manager at the
restaurant.
   But, says Noland, ``it isn't anything to joke about, really.''
   Rewards totaling $10,000 have been offered for information about
the explosives. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
posted the original $5,000 reward Thursday, and the Indiana Arson

   Five months after two American Indians took
hostages at a newspaper to protest local conditions, changes have
been made to address their concerns, but some say it remains to be
seen whether the reforms will bring lasting change.
   Others say the real change is that residents of Robeson County
have realized ``that they can control their lives.''
   ``It's truly cosmetic,'' Eddie Hatcher said last week of the
changes, which include a second superior court judgeship and a task
force named by Gov. Jim Martin to investigate alleged corruption in
the county.
   ``It's nothing more than to douse the fire, hoping it will go
out,'' said Hatcher, one of two Lumbee Indian men who entered the
offices of The Robesonian newspaper Feb. 1, allegedly armed, in
what they said was a protest of local corruption and discrimination
against minorities. The daylong siege ended when the governor
agreed to appoint the task force.

   Shaken by the first schism in the Roman Catholic
Church in more than a century, the Vatican has moved with unusual
speed to try to win back followers of renegade Archbishop Marcel
Lefebvre.
   But it is showing no leniency for those who intend to follow the
82-year-old Frenchman, who consecrated four bishops without papal
approval June 30 and was excommunicated.
   Lefebvre contends the Vatican has broken with true Catholicism
by adopting Mass in languages other than Latin and by taking other
modernist steps.
   Within days of Lefebvre's defiant act, the Vatican firmly stated
that it would not tolerate Lefebvre sympathizers, but it made clear
that it hoped to persuade them to be loyal to the Roman Catholic
Church rather than follow Lefebvre out of it.

<HEAD>`Gee-Whiz' Gear and a Split-Second Decision: Tragedy in the Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Before noon last Sunday, Capt. William C. Rogers III was at war.
His ship, the guided-missile cruiser USS Vincennes, had engaged
five Iranian speedboats in the Strait of Hormuz.
   On the Iranian side of the strait, at the military-civilian
airport in Bandar Abbas, Capt. Mohsen Rezaian of the airline Iran
Air was revving up his Airbus A300 for a 150-mile hop across the
water to Dubai. He had nearly a full load _ 290 passengers and crew.
   Among the passengers: Pakistan's military attache in Iran, who
boarded with his wife and two children; an Iranian couple flying to
Dubai to shop for a daughter's wedding; a woman flying with her
eight children to meet her husband, an Iranian merchant in Dubai;
Indians, Afghans, Yugoslavs, an Italian, going about their peaceful
business in a region at war.
   The old Persian port of Bandar Abbas was a place Capt. Rogers
had to keep an eye on. It was becoming an important base for Iran
in the 8-year-old conflict with Iraq.
   U.S. officials said Iran had moved a few of its hottest fighters
_ U.S.-built F-14 Tomcats _ to Bandar Abbas. It also was believed
to be a base for anti-ship Silkworm missiles, and the Vincennes'
assignment was to protect merchant ships from the Silkworms.
   The mix of civilian and military traffic through the Gulf's hazy
skies was a headache for U.S. patrols.
   ``An Iranian F-4 would take off from Bandar Abbas and right
behind it is a commercial aircraft,'' said one Navy veteran of the
Gulf, Rear Adm. R.G. Zeller. ``They would both take roughly the
same route for a while. Initially it's very difficult to
distinguish between the two. We had to be awfully careful for
obvious reasons.''
   The billion-dollar Aegis-class cruiser Vincennes, a major piece
of U.S. muscle, had been in the Gulf only a month.
   It carried the latest in what Rogers jokingly called ``gee-whiz
merchandise,'' including phased-array radars designed to
simultaneously identify and evaluate the threat from dozens of
potential targets.
   ``Putting this ship with its radar into the gulf will put a lot
of battle management on the scene,'' Rogers had told reporters who
toured the newly arrived vessel.
   To deal with hostile targets, the Vincennes bristled with
Harpoon and Standard missiles, anti-submarine rockets, two 5-inch
guns and two Phalanx close-in, rapid-fire guns to knock down
incoming missiles. ``If it flies, it dies,'' boasted the crew of
the first Aegis cruiser.
   At 10:10 a.m. last Sunday, the Pentagon later reported, Iranian
patrol boats fired on a helicopter from the Vincennes. The patrol
boats are 43-foot Boghammar pleasure boats made in Sweden, souped
up with big engines, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
   At 10:37 a.m., according to Brig. Gen. Mansour Satari, the
Iranian air force commander, Rezaian switched on the twin engines
of the A300 and opened communications with the tower to prepare for
takeoff.
   Five minutes later, by the Pentagon's chronology, the Iranian
patrol boats turned toward the Vincennes at high speed and opened
fire. The Vincennes and the frigate Elmer Montgomery returned fire,
sinking two patrol boats and damaging a third.
   At 10:45 a.m., Iran Air Flight 655 was airborne, and within two
minutes the Vincennes was checking it out by radar. Quickly
reviewing the data from the ``gee-whiz merchandise,'' Rogers
concluded that the blip was an attacking F-14. He gave the order to
fire, and one of two SM-2 Standard missiles from the Vincennes
scored a kill.
   It was then 10:54 a.m., 2:54 a.m. in Washington.
   At 3:45 a.m. EDT, the White House ``situation room'' notified
national security adviser Colin Powell and other officials of the
incident. At 4:52 a.m., Powell woke up President Reagan at Camp
David to report that U.S. forces believe they had shot down an
Iranian jet fighter.
   Meanwhile, news reports from the region quoted shipping sources
as saying an Iranian Airbus had crashed in the Persian Gulf.
   Within an hour, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported
that the plane had been ``downed by the U.S. forces.''
   At the Dubai airport, a shipping executive reported seeing
dozens of people crowding the Iran Air booth for information about
the overdue plane. Among them, the executive told the AP, was the
Iranian merchant.
   ``The man just went out of his mind, going from pillar to post
and banging his head,'' the executive said.
   Shortly before 8 a.m. EDT, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Arnold
Williams, told reporters that U.S. forces sank two patrol boats and
shot down an F-14. U.S. officials are aware of the Iranian claim,
he added, ``and we're checking it out.''
   At 8:11 a.m., Reagan was given a written update, noting the
Iranian claim. At 9:50 a.m. Reagan was notified that the target
apparently was a civilian aircraft.
   In the early afternoon, the president issued a statement saying
U.S. forces, ``in a proper defensive action,'' unintentionally shot
down a passenger plane.
   ``The course of the Iranian civilian airliner was such that it
was headed directly for the USS Vincennes, which was at the time
engaged with five Iranian Boghammar boats that had attacked our
forces. When the aircraft failed to heed repeated warnings, the
Vincennes followed standing orders and widely publicized
procedures, firing to protect itself against possible attack,''
Reagan's statement said.
   Said Rogers, in a message back to the States: ``This is a burden
that I will carry the rest of my life, but I took this action to
defend my ship and my crew. I alone am responsible.''

<HEAD>New Developments in Boesky Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tentacles from the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal surfaced in a surprising way this past week with the
indictment of GAF Corp. for stock manipulation.
   Securities lawyers said such charges against a large U.S.
industrial company are highly unusual and suggest the government is
toughening and expanding its crackdown on Wall Street corruption.
   At the same time, however, they said stock manipulation is
always difficult to prove and that federal prosecutors could face a
time-consuming and possibly embarassing court fight with GAF, a
major producer of chemicals and building materials based in Wayne,
N.J.
   The 10-count indictment returned by a Manhattan federal grand
jury last Wednesday against GAF, vice chairman James T. Sherwin and
two subsidiaries alleges they manipulated Union Carbide Corp. stock
in 1986 after a failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemical
company.
   The object of the purported scheme was to induce other investors
to buy Carbide shares and thereby inflate the price, so GAF could
sell its 10 percent stake at a better profit or with minimal loss,
the indictment alleges.
   If convicted on all counts, GAF could face $15 million in fines,
while Sherwin could face a 50-year prison term and $2.5 million in
fines. GAF and Sherwin have proclaimed innocence and vowed to
contest the charges.
   It is the first indictment brought against an American
industrial concern stemming from evidence supplied indirectly by
Boesky, a well-known stock speculator now serving a three-year
prison term for his central role in the biggest insider trading
case in history.
   The connection between Boesky and GAF is Boyd L. Jefferies,
former head of a West Coast brokerage that bears his name. He was
implicated by Boesky after the speculator agreed to cooperate with
the government's investigation.
   Jefferies, who also has pleaded guilty to criminal charges and
is cooperating with the government, is the main source of
information that led federal prosecutors to investigate GAF.
   ``This appears to be part of the government's pattern of looking
at market practices of all kinds,'' said John F. Olson, a
securities attorney at the Washington law firm of Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher and chairman of the American Bar Association's task force
on insider-trading regulation.
   ``We're seeing more of that and more focus on it,'' he said.
``This also shows that prosecutors are continuing to reap the
benefits of deals they made with Boesky and Jefferies.''
   Nevertheless, securities lawyers said that in the GAF case, one
of the main legal challenges facing the government will be to prove
a conspiracy existed to influence the price of Carbide's stock.
   Carbide is one of the largest publicly held companies and a
component of the Dow Jones industrial average, with more than 127
million common shares. On any given day, its stock price could
change for a number of innocuous reasons, ranging from an analyst's
earnings estimate to a stock-buyback rumor.
   Some people familiar with the GAF indictment, who spoke on
condition they not be identified, said a second potential problem
facing the government is its possible use of Jefferies as a
witness. Because Jefferies is an admitted felon, defense lawyers
could successfully destroy his credibility before a jury.
   A third problem confronting prosecutors is whether the alleged
manipulation succeeded. The government claims Carbide shares rose
in price as a result, although records show GAF didn't sell its
stake until several days later.
   Several attorneys said they doubted prosecutors would have
sought an indictment unless they had much more than evidence
supplied by Jefferies.
   Others also noted that, unlike civil cases, rules concerning
evidence in criminal matters are biased in the government's favor.
The defendants may not know until trial what incriminating material
the prosecutors will present.
   ``I have to assume that if it's a criminal case, the government
will be ready to go to trial, and the judge will certainly push the
case to trial relatively quickly,'' said Gerald Walpin, a partner
at the New York law firm of Rosenman & Colin and a former assistant
U.S. attorney. ``I think certainly within six months we'll know
exactly what the government's case is.''
   The GAF indictment wasn't the only development in the Boesky
scandal this past week. Speculation heightened that the Securities
and Exchange Commission was about to file civil charges against
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment firm that
has been under government investigation for months.
   Another Boesky conspirator, inside trader Dennis B. Levine, was
transferred from prison to serve the remainder of his two-year term
in a Manhattan halfway house. But in a setback for Levine, a
federal judge ruled he must use his $12.8 million in illicit
profits to repay defrauded investors and not back taxes, which
total $12.2 million in federal claims alone.

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _The nation's two largest financial markets took a joint step
toward averting another stock crash, proposing reforms that include
special attention to small investors and coordinated trading halts
when the Dow Jones industrial average falls 250 points. The
announcement by the New York Stock Exchange and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange addressed many issues raised by government studies on the
causes of the October crash.
   _The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to limit American
companies' ability to weaken the voting power of their stockholders
as a way of fighting hostile takeovers. The new one-share, one-vote
rule spells out how shares with reduced voting power can be issued.
   _Federal regulators said it will cost $15.2 billion to bail out
Texas' ailing savings and loan institutions, more than double their
previous estimate.
   _The government said youth summertime employment helped drop the
nation's civilian jobless rate to 5.3 percent in June, the lowest
since 1974. Another government report showed Japan was the only
industrial power to best the United States in reducing
manufacturing labor costs in absolute terms last year.
   _The nation's major retailers said sales rose between 3.5
percent and 4 percent in June, helped by the hot weather and
consumer purchases of summer clothing.
   _Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, after meeting with six
farm-state governors, said there was an urgent need for legislative
action to provide drought relief.
   _Officials of the Farm Credit System announced a merger that
will combine nine of the system's banks for cooperatives into one
lending institution.
   _The United States and Japan signed an agreement opening Japan
to more American beef and citrus.
   _American Suzuki Motor Corp. said sales of its Samurai sport
vehicle plunged 70.6 percent in June from a year earlier. It was
the automaker's first sales report since Consumers Union alleged
the Samurai tips too easily.
   _Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. said their car sales
rose in late June, and the Big Three automakers all finished the
first half of 1988 ahead of the same period last year.
   _Singer Co. agreed to sell its motor products division to Ryobi
Limited of Japan for about $325 million. The division is a major
source of power tools for Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   _Sun Co., a leading producer and distributor of gasoline and
petroleum products, agreed to buy the smaller Atlantic Petroleum
Corp. for $513 million.
   _Tropicana Products Inc. sued Coca-Cola Co. over labeling and
advertising claims for its ``premium choice'' pasteurized Minute
Maid orange juice.
   _Bank of New York Co. got a reprieve in its hostile pursuit of
Irving Bank Corp. when a state judge struck down a provision of
Irving's anti-takeover ``poison pill.''
   _Eastern Airlines and its unions signed an agreement designed to
defuse years of bitter battling and improve safety procedures at
the often-criticized carrier. The pact comes a month after federal
investigators warned that safety could be threatened.
   _USG Corp. shareholders approved a recapitalization and
restructuring plan that increases the company's debt four-fold. The
plan was part of the company's successful defense against a
takeover bid from Desert Partners L.P.
   _Financier Marvin Warner was stunned by a Florida jury verdict
requiring him to pay $22.6 million for fraudulently removing money
from ESM Government Securities, a failing securities dealer.
   _The Postal Service announced that window service at the
nation's post offices, reduced earlier this year to save money,
will return to normal in September.

<HEAD>Some Commodity Markets Cooling Down After Ride On Drought Train</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   After weeks of playing follow-the-soybeans, traders in a number
of commodity markets are looking elsewhere for signals on whether
to buy or sell.
   Some of these markets, such as gold and sugar, have only a
marginal interest in grain and soybean prices to begin with.
   Others _ cotton in particular _ have almost no real relationship
to soybeans and are cooling down after a frantic ride on the
drought train, courtesy of market speculators.
   The Midwestern drought remains the dominant influence in the
grain and soybean markets and in the livestock markets, where the
price of feed grain is directly related to production costs.
   But the drought's diminishing impact on the prices of other
commodities illustrates how the powerful psychology of a runaway
market can sweep others along with it _ until the facts get in the
way.
   ``In the end, the fundamentals always reign supreme,'' said
Ernest Simon, cotton specialist with Prudential Bache Securities
Inc. in New York.
   In the cotton market, the fundamentals include the Agriculture
Department's prediction of a 5.6 million-bale surplus on July 31,
the end of the current marketing year, and a whopping 6.8
million-bale surplus a year later. There is nearly enough cotton in
storage to fulfill all of next year's expected domestic demand,
twice as much as experts consider adequate.
   Before the drought began, the USDA estimated 1988-89 cotton
production at 14 million bales. Analysts say even severe drought
damage wouldn't reduce the oversupply.
   ``We could lose 2{ million bales and not be hurt,'' said Ed
Whitten, cotton specialist with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   So why did near-month cotton futures follow the soybean market's
sharp springtime surge, rallying from about 60 cents a pound on
April 15 to almost 70 cents by June 20?
   ``Cotton very often is called soybean's little brother,''
Whitten said. ``It follows it slavishly.''
   Added Rich Cantor, cotton analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.: ``It wasn't so much the fabulous buying that brought
the prices up, it was that you didn't have anybody willing to sell
it. That allowed the speculative element to move prices higher in
tandem with the other markets.''
   Cotton futures prices have since come back down to around 60
cents a pound.
   ``People finally became convinced the fundamentals had been
ignored too long, said Simon.
   The inflation-sensitive gold market followed a similar, albeit
shorter path. In early June, gold for August delivery surged above
its recent $440-to-$460 trading range to more than $470 a troy
ounce. The accepted explanation was that traders feared the sharp
rise in grain prices would lead to greater inflation.
   Those worries were quickly calmed by economists, who pointed out
the miniscule impact of food prices on the Consumer Price Index,
and gold prices eased back into their well-worn trading range.
   ``The soybean market and the rally we had in previous weeks
certainly constituted a psychological inducement to rally the
precious metals. But in general you have to keep the advance in
perspective,'' said George Anagnos, metals analyst with Thomson
McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``The gold market indicated ... that food-inspired increases
alone were not going to boost inflation rates to dangerously high
levels.''
   In fact, commodity markets almost never take their direction
from a single source and single-day moves often have no easy
explanation, said Steve Chronowitz, director of futures research
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   ``The media naturally wants to know why gold is up a dollar
today or why it's down a dollar,'' he said. ``Sometimes there is no
reason. But when they're at a loss to explain a move, analysts will
tend to tie it to something else.''

<HEAD>With Unemployment Down, Pressure Building For Bigger Wage Demands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a long break from inflation, the United
States is entering the early phase of a new cycle of quickly rising
prices, some economists now say.
   A resurgence of inflation may take a year or more, but if it
does set in again, it might not be stoppable by anything short of a
government-induced recession, these economists say.
   The U.S. economy has defied expectations of trouble many times
before during this record, nearly 6-year-long expansion, and it may
do so again.
   The bond market, which is the most sensitive barometer of
inflation, has been fairly calm lately. Interest rates are down
from their highs of late May.
   But inflation alarms went up Friday when the government reported
that the nation's civilian unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in
June, its lowest level in 14 years.
   The report added to inflationary concerns caused by the
export-led boom in manufacturing, which has resulted in bottlenecks
and spotty shortages. Meanwhile, industrial commodity prices have
jumped 25 percent in the past two years.
   A low jobless rate means employers are having trouble finding
and keeping qualified workers. By the laws of supply and demand,
that means wages could start rising rapidly.
   American workers have been tolerating low wage increases for so
long that some economists have concluded that they have permanently
lowered their expectations.
   In the last year, for example, wages rose 3.2 percent, failing
to keep up with a roughly 4.4 percent increase in consumer prices.
   In June, the average hourly wage rate in private industry was no
higher than the May rate: $9.27 an hour.
   At some point, though, the tables are likely to turn. Workers
will be in such demand that they will be able to insist on pay
increases that help them catch up, or at least stop falling farther
behind.
   And since wage costs account for about 55 percent of the cost of
production, big pay increases could push the economy into an
inflationary cycle.
   Kenneth Goldstein, labor economist for the Conference Board,
says the ``startling'' June jobless rate is probably a quirk caused
by an underestimate of the size of the labor force. He says there
is no strong evidence of a tight labor market.
   But Lacy Hunt, chief economist of the CM&M Group, said, ``Wages
are slow to react, but when they turn, they turn decisively and
rapidly and then they're hard to contain.''
   Hunt was the most pessimistic on inflation of 32 economists
included in a forecasting chart published last week by the Wall
Street Journal, predicting an inflation rate of 6.8 percent in the
first half of 1989.
   Still, even economists who are relatively optimistic say the
situation is worsening. ``There are a lot of little pieces of
evidence that inflation is starting to accelerate,'' said Nancy
Lazar, an economist for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
   The drop in the dollar from its 1985 peak has created strong
demand for American-made products and strained the production
capacity of U.S. factories. The dollar's recent rise could take off
some of the edge, but it may not last.
   Adding to the strain is the huge federal budget deficit, which
has become more of a problem now that the economy is already in
danger of overheating. When the government spends more than it
takes in, it can overstimulate an economy that is barely coping
with strong private demand.
   Hunt said the government should try to slash the federal deficit
to less than $100 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but
realistically expects the gap to spread to as much as $180 billion.
   With government spending out of control, the only remedy for
inflation is on the supply side. The Federal Reserve, not known for
its finesse, would have to cool off the economy by jacking up
interest rates, very likely choking off the historic expansion,
Hunt said.
   ``We're in the early stages of an insurgence of inflation,''
Hunt said. ``This is the equivalent of the Vietnam inflation of the
mid-'60s, the early stages of the Nixon inflation of late '72, and
the early stages of the Carter inflation around 1977 or 1978.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Uninspired by `Banner Year'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the stock market has rallied since late
spring, Wall Street is still having trouble working up much
excitement over what President Reagan has labeled a ``banner year
for peace and prosperity.''
   The occasion for Reagan's statement was a Labor Department
report Friday that the civilian unemployment rate fell three-tenths
of a percentage point in June to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
   That figure, and the accompanying news of a 346,000 increase in
non-farm payroll employment, far exceeded advance estimates on Wall
Street.
   The dramatic numbers seemed to leave the stock market with a
clearly defined choice: Either it could jump ahead on the evidence
of solid economic growth, or it could drop sharply amid the
inflation fears that have been raised by many other favorable
economic reports of late.
   As it turned out, however, the market did neither of those
things. Instead, it spent the day drifting quietly lower, almost as
though there was no news of any note to deal with.
   One primary source of caution in the financial markets of late
has been a widespread suspicion that the state of the economy is
too good to last.
   Before long, many investors fear, strong growth will bring with
it increased inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.
Indeed, rates moved up significantly on Friday after the employment
statistics were issued.
   To some analysts, this amounts to nothing more than the latest
of a series of false inflation scares that have hit the markets in
recent years.
   Yes, they say, the rise of the Consumer Price Index in 1988 is
likely to be a little larger than it was last year, with production
closer to full capacity and special influences like the drought in
the farm belt.
   But no, they argue, inflation is not about to reach the point
where it forces stringent credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve
and brings an end to the economic expansion.
   ``The economic cycle will last longer than any investors
expect,'' maintains Donald Carver at Centre Square Investment Group
in Philadelphia.
   ``Peak earnings are still several quarters away. Inflationary
pressures from some commodity prices are offset by weakness in
energy.
   ``Interest rates are unlikely, anytime soon, to reach levels
that would dampen the economy.''
   Such assurances did little for the stock market in the past
week, however. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
25.43 points to 2,106.15.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell .87 to 152.81,
and the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
.37 to 394.33. The American Stock Exchange market value index edged
up .02 to 309.02.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 163.40 million shares a day,
down from 208.42 million the week before.
   Susan Berge Kent at Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day Inc. takes a
different slant on the inflation debate: She regards fears of
upward pressure on prices as misguided, but thinks the stock market
is headed for trouble anyway.
   Ms. Kent argues that the basic question facing the stock market
is how the nation will deal with ``the greatest debt problem this
country has faced since the late 1920s.
   ``Since the early 1980s,'' she says, ``deflation has been a
greater risk than inflation, particularly in light of the debt
problem.''
   But, in her view, fears of inflation could lead policymakers,
notably the Federal Reserve Board, to take actions that would turn
many heavy debtors into bankrupts.
   She concludes, ``The risk is that the Fed will tighten, raise
the discount rate, at a time when free market forces are already
pulling in the direction of deflation rather than inflation.''

<HEAD>Low Unemployment Rate Raises Inflation Fears</HEAD>

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Droves of teen-agers on summer employment rolls helped push the
nation's unemployment rate to a 14-year low in June, but the news
rekindled inflation fears and sent stock and bond prices tumbling.
   The Labor Department reported Friday before trading began on
Wall Street that the unemployment rate for June stood at 5.3
percent.
   The unexpectedly strong report sent the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials down 16.54 points to a close at 2,106.15 in light
trading.
   Concern that inflation might rise as the economy heats up also
rippled through the credit markets, where the Treasury's bellwether
30-year issue fell about $10 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield
jumped to 9.09 percent from 9.00 percent late Thursday.
   But the unemployment report was welcomed in the currency
markets, where the dollar jumped despite central bank intervention.
   Traders reasoned that a big reported rise in manufacturing
employment was an indication that exports remained strong, which
could help shrink the trade deficit and support the dollar.
   The Labor Department said the sharp drop from May's 5.6 percent
jobless rate was caused by a seasonally adjusted surge of 820,000
people _ three-fourths of them youths 16 to 24 years old _ onto the
nation's payrolls.
   Joblessness among black youths plummeted more than 6 percentage
points to its lowest level on record.
   Analysts had anticipated a large increase this year in the
number of available summer jobs, especially in the tourist
industry, as foreigners taking advantage of the devalued dollar
flock to the United States for their vacations.
   In other economic developments Friday:
   _The Federal Reserve Board reported that Americans increased
their installment borrowing at a modest annual rate of 4.6 percent
in May, as growth in consumer credit slowed from the rapid
expansion of earlier this year.
   Consumers took out $2.42 billion more in credit than they paid
off in May, compared with net growth of $3.85 billion in April.
   _Oil futures turned mixed in moderate trading as dealers
reassessed the impact of the recent North Sea oil rig explosion on
petroleum supplies and prospects for an emergency OPEC meeting
diminished.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
fell 37 cents to $15.46 per 42-gallon barrel.

   Oil futures gave up some of their recent gains
as dealers reassessed the impact of the recent North Sea oil rig
explosion on petroleum supplies and prospects for an emergency OPEC
meeting diminished.
   ``It may be a case of calmer heads prevailing today,'' Peter
Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said of Friday's
trading session.
   Prices for petroleum futures and contracts for refined products
had soared on Thursday as traders reacted to reports that the
Scotland rig explosion would affect about 12 percent of total North
Sea production, or as much as 300,000 barrels of oil per day.
   In addition, there was concern that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting countries might call an emergency meeting to
discuss overproduction among some of its members.
   ``I think they over-reacted to the effects of the platform fire
and they realized it really didn't mean that much ... and the gains
were given back,'' said James R. Steele, an energy analsyt with
Refco Inc. ``I think the market also realized there wasn't going to
be an emergency meeting.''
   As a result, he said, Friday's trading was highlighted by
profit-taking and a general correction from Thursday's overbought
condition.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 37 cents to
$15.46 per 42-gallon barrel after closing 47 cents higher on
Thursday. The contract had traded well above $16 during that
session.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, home heating oil
fell 0.90 cent to 43.39 cents a gallon.
   Unleaded gasoline rose 0.05 cent to 53.17 cents a gallon.
Analysts attributed the slight rise to reports of strong seasonal
demand.
