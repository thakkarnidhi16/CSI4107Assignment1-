   A Northwest Airlines crew had to postpone
their takeoff when a group of eight deer strolled across the runway.
There was no sign of a sleigh or a jolly man in a red suit,
witnesses said.
   The crew of another plane noticed the deer Friday and radioed
Kansas City International Airport's control tower, which notified
the Northwest pilots, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Bob Raynesford.
   Raynesford said no passengers were injured during the aborted
takeoff, which he called ``an unusual event but really rather
routine.''
   The flight, which was headed to Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport, got
off a few minutes later, he said.

   A jury ordered a psychiatrist to pay nearly
$1.9 million to a female patient with whom he had sex numerous times
over a 12-year period, billing her for each visit.
   The Multnomah County Circuit Court jury deliberated for five
hours Thursday before reaching its verdict against Dr. James L.
Petroske of Portland.
   The woman, a 55-year-old former elementary school teacher, was
awarded $832,000 in general damages for pain and suffering, $1
million in punitive damages and $43,800 in lost wages.
   Testimony and evidence presented during the two-week trial
indicated Petroske began treating the woman in 1967 and started
having sexual relations with her in 1975.
   James Huegli, the woman's attorney, said Petroske ended the
sexual relations in early 1987 while he was being investigated by
the state Board of Medical Examiners about allegations that he was
having sex with another patient.
   Petroske admitted he lied to the state board about the number of
patients with whom he had sexual relations. In early July, the board
suspended him from practice for 90 days, fined him $5,000 and placed
him on probation for 10 years.
   Petroske's attorney, Carol A. Hewitt, told jurors during closing
arguments that her client is ``not going to be practicing medicine
under any circumstances after this case is over.''
   Hewitt admitted Petroske had inflicted physical damage on the
patient, but she contended it was not permanent. Huegli, however,
said other doctors thought the woman suffered permanent brain damage
from what he called a ``long, insidious, poisoning regimen'' of
drugs prescribed by Petroske.
   Huegli said Petroski billed the woman for all her visits,
including the ones in which they engaged in sex.

   A Chicago-bound United Airlines jet with 311
people on board dumped fuel over the Pacific Ocean and returned for
a safe landing Friday after it developed engine trouble.
   United Flight 108 reported problems with the DC-10's rear engine,
shortly after takeoff from Los Angeles International Airport, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Barbara Abel.
   Frightened passengers who disembarked from the disabled plane
told of hearing two loud bangs shortly after takeoff.
   After dumping fuel over the ocean, the pilot landed the plane
about 2:20 p.m. PST. FAA investigators were checking the engine, and
there was no immediate determination of what caused the trouble.
   The plane has three engines and is designed to be able to fly
even if two out of three are disabled.

   Two groups of feuding nuns at a
monastery here will be separated by an iron gate as they celebrate
the same Christmas Mass unreconciled after a 2{-month standoff.
   Five nuns who remain locked in the monastery's infirmary have
said they will not rejoin eight other nuns until the Vatican in Rome
answers their pleas to end the dispute over liberalizations of their
order.
   ``They'll watch the midnight Mass from the where they are,
through the bars,'' said Sister Eliane, a Carmelite who lives at the
Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel but is not among the 13
cloistered nuns.
   ``They'll all be doing the same thing, only they won't be doing
them together.''
   The five nuns will watch the Christmas midnight Mass through two
small openings covered by an iron gate in the infirmary, which
overlooks the darkened chapel of the monastery, Sister Eliane said
this week.
   The rebel nuns locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4 to
thwart what they say was their imminent eviction from the monastery.
They said their mother superior, Prioress Mother Teresa Hewitt,
wanted them kicked out for speaking against such liberalizations as
the introduction of television and sweets to the monastery.
   Mother Teresa has said the dispute revolves around the barricaded
nuns' unwillingness to follow her orders.
   Vatican officials so far have declined comment.
   The standoff at first was marked by a bitter media campaign, with
Sister John of the Cross, one of the protesting nuns, fielding
reporters' questions by telephone, and Sister Teresa holding a news
conference to lambaste the nuns' ``attempted anarchy.''
   Both sides have been virtually silent since.
   Meanwhile, friends and family of the nuns are trying to make the
holiday a little brighter.
   The infirmary is decorated with a 2-foot Christmas tree adorned
with red ribbons, an Advent wreath and small felt banners plastered
with biblical passages, Sister Eliane said.
   ``They're not down in the dumps or anything, but they're anxious
to hear from Rome,'' she said of all the nuns who live at the
monastery. ``It's obvious that it's not going to be settled before
the holidays. We're just hoping it won't be too long after the new
year.''
   Christmas dinner also will be segregated.
   A man who caters a Christmas meal of fish for the monastery each
year will carry on a tradition that was started by his late brother,
a priest, Sister Eliane said. The donor, whom she would not
identify, said he would provide dinner only if all the nuns share
the food.
   They will, but they'll maintain their separate quarters, Sister
Eliane said.
   ``Christmas is Christmas no matter what your problems are at the
time,'' she said. ``We all plan on making the most of it.''

<HEAD>American Red Cross Focusing On Long-Term Aid To Soviet Armenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross has begun focusing on
long-term plans to help earthquake-stricken Soviet Armenia rebuild
its destroyed and damaged health care facilities.
   Richard F. Schubert, president of the American Red Cross, said
the pipeline of emergency aid supplies is full and flowing well, and
no further immediate aid is needed at this time.
   Priority attention is being given to the construction of a new
general hospital, he told a news conference Friday. The earthquake
destroyed the only one, killing all doctors and staff inside the
building.
   In a related development, the office of President-elect Bush said
his son and grandson are flying to Soviet Armenia over the Christmas
weekend to deliver toys and medical supplies to earthquake victims.
   Jeb Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, and his son, George,
12, will spend about six hours in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, on
Christmas Day.
   The Bushes are traveling to Armenia as volunteers for Americares,
a private relief agency that has chartered a DC-8 cargo plane to
transport supplies to the region when 55,000 people were killed in
the earthquake and about 500,000 were left homeless.
   Schubert said the Red Cross has received $3.5 million in cash
contributions and pledges for Armenia disaster relief and that more
money is coming in ``every hour.''
   He said the Red Cross will use the funds to help replace health
and medical facilities that were destroyed by the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   The Red Cross will be prepared to help fill any gaps that appear
at the request of the Soviet Red Cross, he said.
   Schubert said priority long-term needs in Armenia include:
   _The building of a general hospital to replace one that was
totally destroyed in the quake.
   _The creation of a facility to make and install artificial limbs.
   _The establishment of a permanent tracking center to trace
families of earthquake victims.
   _A disaster preparedness program to reduce deaths and injuries in
the event of another earthquake in Armenia.
   _The rebuilding and expansion of a destroyed school for
handicapped children.
   Schubert, who returned Thursday from an inspection tour of the
disaster areas in Armenia, said 27,000 railroad cars of relief
supplies have arrived so far in addition to 148 planes carrying
emergency equipment.
   He said Soviet officials have been conscientious in keeping track
of the incoming supplies. They have promised to return expensive
equipment to donors or to seek permission to use it elsewhere once
it is no longer needed in Armenia, he said.
   There have been reports of confusion and inept rescue efforts at
the disaster scene, but Schuster said he believes the work went well
given the immensity of the destruction and the relative inexperience
of Soviet officials in disaster relief.
   ``Given the size of the disaster, I think they responded well,''
he said. ``It's impossible to have a disaster site in which there is
not confusion initially.''
   In addition, he said, it should be noted that in the first day or
so, ``all of the people present were affected; they all lost family
members.''
   ``The people displayed wonderful warmth and dignity,'' Schubert
said. ``Time after time they expressed their thanks to the American
public, particularly to thank those in the American-Armenian
community,'' he said. ``When they stopped to thank us on the streets
the profusion of gratitude made it difficult to hold back tears _
theirs and ours.''
   Schubert said the Soviet Red Cross helped deal with the crisis
effectively and offered all forms of cooperation to its American
counterpart.
   ``Bad times bring good people together,'' Schubert said.
   In addition to the $3.5 million in cash and pledges, Schubert
said the American Red Cross has received more than $8 million worth
of medical and other supplies and shipped them to Armenia.
   These include kidney dialysis machines, blood collection bags,
plaster dressings, needles and syringes, finger splints, bandages,
antiseptics, sutures, cervical collars, antibiotics, orthopedic
pins, ultrasound machines, plastic eating utensils, blankets and
plastic sheeting.

<HEAD>Two Suits In Continental Airlines Crash Resolved by Settlement
Master</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of 17 lawsuits filed after the crash a
Continental Airlines jetliner last year have been settled out of
court, according to court documents filed by Friday's deadline.
   Continental Flight 1713 crashed on takeoff during a snowstorm
Nov. 15, 1987, killing 28 of the 82 people on board, and injuring 54.
   The 15 remaining lawsuits are scheduled to go to trial beginning
Jan. 9.
   Also Friday, U.S. District Judge Sherman G. Finesilver denied
motions from the airline for dismissal of punitive damage claims,
rejecting Continental's contention that various provisions of the
Federal Aviation Act pre-empt traditional areas of state regulation.
He also ruled that Texas law could be used to calculate damages,
rather than Colorado law which more severely limits such damages.
Continental's parent company, Texas Air, is based in Houston.
   Details of the two settlements disclosed Friday, both of which
involved passengers who survived but were seriously injured, were
not released.
   Initially, 36 lawsuits were filed but several have been settled
out of court and several other new suits have been filed.
   Lawyers for Continental say Denver airport officials are
responsible for allowing snow and slush to build on the runway and
that the Federal Aviation Administration allowed flights to continue
throughout the snowstorm.
   Continental also contends that the crash occurred because of
swirling winds created by a jumbo jet that landed shortly before
Flight 1713 took off.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has authorized the
Soviet Union to begin a new round of subsidized wheat purchases from
the United States.
   Acting Undersecretary Richard W. Goldberg said Friday that Moscow
has been allocated 2 million metric tons of wheat under the
department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, which allows
designated foreign buyers to buy U.S. commodities at cut-rate prices.
   The Soviets bought about 9 million tons of wheat under EEP
arrangements during the 1987-88 year that ended Sept. 30 but so far
has not ordered any for 1988-89 delivery.
   Goldberg also said the Soviet Union will be allowed to buy up to
16 million tons of U.S. grain in the 1988-89 year. The limit under a
recently extended agreement between the two countries was 12 million
tons.
   Meanwhile, the department said Moscow has bought more corn, which
does not carry the EEP subsidies. Both wheat and corn are included
in the agreement.
   The EEP arrangement allows American exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Earlier this week, for example, USDA announced an EEP wheat sale
to China that carried a subsidy rate of $23.10 per ton, or about 63
cents per bushel.
   Officials also said Friday that the Soviets bought an additional
750,000 tons of U.S. corn, bringing the total sold to 8.78 million
tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1.
   Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly
less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized,
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of
corn would be about 29.5 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $77 million.
   Besides the corn and the likelihood of wheat for 1988-89 delivery
under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans
and 532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.

   Under pressure from Congress, the Farmers Home
Administration is easing some of the paperwork requirements for
delinquent borrowers. But it says a 45-day deadline for responding
to overdue notices won't change.
   A growing number of lawmakers have been urging the Agriculture
Department agency to extend the deadline, which gives farmers 45
days in which to respond after receiving official notices to begin
settling overdue loan accounts.
   The notices were sent out last month to more than 80,000
delinquent borrowers who owe FmHA more than $8 billion.
   ``There's just no way legally we can stretch it (the deadline),''
acting agency Administrator La Verne Ausman said Friday. ``We must
hear from the farmer within that time.''
   Several basic ``response'' forms must be completed and returned
within 45 days as the minimum requirement.
   Ausman said that in order to ease paperwork requirements for late
repayers, FmHA county offices will accept supporting documents for
the applications after the 45-day deadline, but that such agreements
must be worked out with those offices.
   The notices were sent out to FmHA borrowers who were at least 180
days delinquent in repaying loans. The notices informed them of loan
servicing and restructuring options, and said failure to respond
would trigger ``acceleration'' of loan collection, a step toward
foreclosure or forced sale of assets.
   ``We have advised our field offices to use a test of
reasonableness with borrowers who, through no fault of their own,
are unable to complete all the forms on time,'' Ausman said.
   ``For example,'' he added, ``if because of illness or other
circumstances beyond his or her control, a farmer couldn't obtain
all the information he or she needed, we won't be hard-nosed if they
have given us completed response forms, and farm and home plans. But
we will be looking for evidence of a good-faith effort on the part
of the borrower to get all the forms in a timely manner.''
   Ausman said that as a minimum, the documents that must be sent in
within 45 days include:
   _Form FmHA 410-1, Application for FmHA Services.
   _Form FmHA 431-2, Farm and Home Plan, including the balance sheet.
   _Attachment 2, Acknowledgement of Notice of Program Availability,
or Attachment 4, Response to Notice Informing Me of FmHA's Intent to
Accelerate My Loan.

   A scientific advisory panel says it has
concerns about NASA's efforts to continue improvements in the design
of the space shuttle's booster rockets.
   H. Guyford Stever, chairman of the National Research Council
panel, said Friday that although NASA has flown two successful
missions since the 1986 Challenger accident, he has a ``broad
concern'' that the space agency continue to monitor and evaluate the
redesigned booster rockets.
   ``Success breeds confidence, and that's what you want, but it can
also threaten you with complacency,'' Stever said in an interview.
   He added, ``I don't see complacency developing, but I do know
they have budget problems, and how they'll solve that is difficult
to say.''
   Stever's panel, in its final report delivered to NASA on
Wednesday, cited two new problems with the redesigned boosters used
in the Sept. 29 launch of the shuttle Discovery:
   _Small pieces of cork used to cover external diagnostic
instruments and their electrical leads were lost during flight and
one piece is believed to have damaged thermal tiles on the orbiter.
Cork is also suspected of causing extensive damage to tiles on
Atlantis, which was launched Dec. 2.
   _Metal-to-metal seals were scratched and pitted. Stever said that
removal of the seals could raise shuttle program costs, but he said
the scars were small and did not threaten safety.
   The report also lists nine problem areas that need to be
addressed before the redesign effort can be considered complete.
   Among the remaining tasks are strengthening of the conical base
of the booster rocket, more testing of booster segments to determine
their potential to be reused safely, improving materials for bonding
booster parts, developing alternative materials for O-ring seals and
more test-firing at cold temperatures, the report said.
   In the Challenger accident, one of the O-rings between the
booster segments failed, allowing hot exhaust gases from the rocket
to leak and cause the explosion that destroyed the shuttle and
killed its crew of seven. Cold temperatures also contributed to the
O-ring's failure.
   NASA said it will ``carefully consider all the group's
recommendations.''
   Stever said NASA officials have told him the agency has plans to
carry out some of the tasks cited in the report, including a
cold-weather test scheduled next month, and is considering the
others on the list.
   The booster rockets worked for 24 flights before failing on the
Challenger mission, Stever pointed out. Referring to the redesigned
booster rockets, he said, ``we don't consider it a bad design, it's
just that things could be improved further.''
   The report also recommends several risk-reduction steps,
including maintaining technically competent personnel familiar with
booster design to evaluate and improve quality control, assembly and
launch operations and maintaining ground-testing and in-flight
performance measuring programs.
   It also recommends insulating the budget for these safety
activities from ``competitive pressures'' from other programs.
   The panel of independent scientists was set up at the request of
the White House-appointed Rogers commission that investigated the
Challenger accident. The commission asked the panel to monitor
NASA's compliance with its recommendations.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Robinson Tried To ``Change the Temperature''</HEAD>

   Former ABC News anchorman Max Robinson, who
died of complications resulting from AIDS, was eulogized by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson as a man who ``wouldn't adjust, wouldn't knuckle under
the face of ... racism.''
   Jackson, a close friend of Robinson's, delivered the eulogy
Friday at a Washington church where friends and co-workers of the
nation's first black network television anchor paid their last
respects.
   Robinson, said Jackson, ``wouldn't adjust, wouldn't knuckle under
the face of obvious and not so obvious racism.''
   Robinson had been ill for more than a year when he died Tuesday
at Howard University Hospital at age 49.
   ``Max Robinson never adjusted,'' Jackson said. ``He sought to
transform. He was not a TV thermometer who measured things and
spilled them back out. He tried to be a thermostat _ to change the
temperature.''
   Jackson told reporters that he talked to Robinson about how he
had contracted AIDS and that Robinson told him: ``It is not
homosexuality but it was promiscuity. ... Let my predicament be a
source of education to our people.''
   Among those attending the ceremony were ABC News President Roone
Arledge, ABC anchorman Peter Jennings, CBS anchorman Dan Rather, 60
Minutes reporter Ed Bradley and CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw.
   ``I think ABC News is a better place today than it was before Max
was there,'' said Arledge. ``A lot of that is due to his efforts.''
   Robinson began his broadcasting career as a radio station disc
jockey in his hometown of Richmond, Va. He moved to Washington in
1965 and three years later became the first black to anchor
newscasts at a major TV station, appearing on the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m.
news on Channel 9 WTOP, now WUSA, with co-anchor Gordon Peterson.
   Robinson then left Washington after 10 years at the top of the
ratings to join ABC as the first black to anchor a network news
show. He was one of three anchors at ABC, along with Jennings and
Frank Reynolds.
   The frustrated Robinson made headlines publicly denouncing racism
at the news organization during a speech at Smith College in
February 1981.
   Arledge was supervising news coverage when Robinson was an
anchor, and he changed ABC News' three-anchor format after Reynolds
died in 1983. At that point, Jennings inherited the job as sole
anchor of the newscasts, and Robinson was assigned to do news briefs
and weekend anchor.
   In 1984, he left ABC News in Washington and joined WMAQ-TV in
Chicago. The following June, he entered a hospital specializing in
alcohol rehabilitation suffering from emotional and physical
exhaustion, according to Nick Aronson, director of communications at
WMAQ-TV. Aronson said Robinson never returned to the station, and
did sporadic freelance work after that.
   He is survived by his mother, Doris Robinson Griffin, and
stepfather, the Rev. James Griffin, both from Norfolk, Va., and four
children, Mark, Maureen, Michael and Malik Robinson.
   Robinson also leaves three surviving siblings, Jewel R. Shepperd,
Jean Robinson Yancey and civil rights activist Randall Robinson, the
head of TransAfrica. All live in Washington.

   John Gonella, a former aide to President Lyndon
Johnson and Capitol Hill lobbyist, died Friday at his Maryland home
at age 71.
   Gonella, most recently an assistant to the vice president of the
Association of American Railroads, began his career in Washington in
1949, when he moved here to work as an information officer for the
embassy of Pakistan.
   He was a press spokesman and congressional liaison with a number
of firms before joining the State Department's congressional
relations office in 1965. He joined the Johnson White House staff in
1966 and served as a congressional liaison through 1969.
   Gonella worked as a Washington consultant for two years and then
worked from 1971-77 on the staffs of Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia and Harrison A. Williams of New Jersey.
   During the 1950s, Gonella also wrote a golf column for The
Washington Post.
   Gonella, a native of Dollar, Scotland, graduated from Glasgow
University with degrees in economics and political science. He
served in the British Army during World War II and came to New York
in 1948, where he was a professional golfer and radio and television
newsman before moving to Washington a year later.

   Twenty-five journalists were slain around the
world in 1988, seven fewer than in 1987, but other forms of violence
and intimidation against news gatherers increased, according to a
survey of press freedom.
   During the year, 225 journalists were arrested or detained in
various countries and 24 expelled, Freedom House said Friday in its
annual survey.
   Fourteen were kidnapped or disappeared, 28 wounded, 90 beaten or
otherwise assaulted, 43 were targets of death threats and 12 had
their homes raided or destroyed, it said.
   It said 40 newspapers or radio stations in 12 countries were
closed and that nine were bombed, burned or destroyed. Also, more
than 200 instances of lesser harassment occurred.
   The anti-press actions occurred in 70 countries, compared with 57
countries the year before.
   ``The figures do not reflect other forms of official and
unofficial editorial censorship, and diverse methods of economic and
political pressuring of the mass media,'' said the survey report by
Leonard Sussman, a Freedom House senior scholar.
   ``The statistics are a clue, however, to those official actions
which generate self-censorship by journalists.''
   The figures for 1988 are as of Dec. 10.
   The world survey rated press conditions as ``most free'' in 57
countries, including most states of the Western alliance, and
``least free'' in 83, including the communist bloc and much of the
Third World. Nineteen other countries were described as
``intermediary'' and included some of Central America and scattered
Third World nations.
   It said the United Kingdom, whose press is in the most-free
category, was slipping by using its Official Secrets Act to try to
block publication of some stories.
   It said that such least-free nations as China, the Soviet Union
and Hungary had improved by displaying more openness while remaining
centrally controlled.
   Freedom House describes itself as a non-partisan national
organization that monitors political and civil rights and tries to
strengthen free societies.

   Drivers who overstayed their parking meters
received a surprise holiday message _ in meter _ from Montgomery
County.
   Parking employees in the county north of Washington, D.C., put a
few lines of poetry on the windshields of violators Thursday instead
of the usual $10 tickets. The 4-by-8 inch cards bore this greeting:
   ``The meter was red as time had expired
   ``In the rush of the season we knew you'd be tired,
   ``A parking ticket would just make you blue
   ``In the holiday spirit this just wouldn't do,
   ``So during this time of friendship and good cheer
   ``Season's Greetings to you and best wishes all year.''
   The holiday gesture cost the county approximately $10,000 in
potential fines, officials said.

   For 56 years, Betty Sedat and Grace
Dutton have been exchanging Christmas cards _ or rather one
Christmas card, sent back and forth year after year.
   The greeting features a bagpipe-playing Scotsman with the verse:
``Hoot! for a Jolly Christmas! I'll send a card to wish ye a
Christmas full of cheer. I'll send my name in pencil so ye'll use
the card next year.''
   Mrs. Sedat first sent the card to her friend in 1932.
   ``I thought it was funny,'' she said. ``So I did sign it in
pencil along with the date, mailed it off to Grace, and forgot all
about it.''
   Sure enough, a year later it returned with Ms. Dutton's name
signed below Mrs. Sedat's.
   ``We signed and dated it every year, in pencil of course, first
on the front, then on the back, until we ran out of room,'' Mrs.
Sedat said.
   The exchange continued even after Mrs. Sedat moved to Guatemala
with her husband to do missionary work for several years with the
Nazarene Church.
   The friends say their relationship has been as durable as the
card.
   ``We keep in touch, and see each other several times a year,''
said Mrs. Sedat.

   Fuel oil from a leaking barge began
washing ashore on resort beaches of the southwestern Washington
coast Friday, and at least 50 birds were found with oil on their
feathers, officials said.
   The barge trailed an oil slick that grew to 30 miles long and 100
feet wide in the hours after a Thursday night collision with a
tugboat, Coast Guard officials said.
   Authorities closed 1{ to 2 miles of beach in the Ocean Shores
area near here, on the north side of Grays Harbor, where oiled birds
were found. The area contains numerous wetlands and marshes that are
home to migratory waterfowl.
   Rescue teams were being mobilized to try and clean and save as
many birds as possible, authorities said.
   ``The latest reports I'm getting indicate an average of 12 dead
or distressed birds are being found every quarter of a mile along
the beach,'' said Mark Stewart, a spokesman for the state Divison of
Emergency Management.
   The leaking barge was towed south to the mouth of the Columbia
River, which separates Oregon and Washington. It bobbed 25 miles
offshore Friday night while authorities waited for daylight to
assess how best to repair it.
   Washington state officials estimated some 70,000 gallons of oil
had spilled from the barge, said Bob Steelquist of the Washington
state Department of Wildlife.
   The oil was leaking from a tank holding about 250,000 gallons of
oil, said Coast Guard Lt. Eldo DeLong in Seattle. In all, the barge
held about 2.75 million gallons of oil, but only the one tank was
leaking.
   Sause Bros. Ocean Towing Inc., of Coos Bay, Ore., operators of
the barge and its tugboat, hired crews to clean up the beaches.
   The accident occurred Thursday night as a tow line either broke
or was being adjusted in heavy seas between the tug Ocean Services
and the barge, named the Nestucca. The accident occurred about two
miles off Grays Harbor, on the southwestern Washington coast.
   The barge had been scheduled to make a delivery at Grays Harbor,
then head to Portland, said Dick Lauer of Sause Bros.
   Officials said they would have a better idea Saturday of the
extent of the damage to beaches and wildlife.
   Grays Harbor County Sheriff Dennis Morrisette said he could smell
oil in the air and the sand was darker than usual.

   The Federal Aviation Administration has advised
airports worldwide to tighten security because of concern _ not yet
confirmed by investigators _ that a terrorist bomb may have caused
the Pan Am crash in Scotland.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said Friday the alert was
prompted by the crash, the heavy Christmas travel period and ``what
obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions''
regarding terrorist activities.
   The advisory to beef up security applies to both major U.S.
airports and airlines and foreign airports served by U.S. carriers,
he said.
   McArtor, in an interview with reporters, declined to discuss
specifically Wednesday's crash of Pan Am Flight 103, in which all
258 people aboard perished.
   There has been widespread speculation _ and some preliminary
indications _ that an explosion may have caused the crash, although
no clear evidence of terrorist involvement has yet to surface.
   Suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the unexplained sudden
breakup of the plane, a claim of responsibility and disclosures that
the U.S. government had been warned of a plot to bomb a Pan Am
flight between Frankfurt and New York in December. The ill-fated
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, with a change of planes in
London.
   McArtor said Pan Am had imposed ``a very heightened level of
security'' at Frankfurt airport after the FAA alerted the airline in
early December that an anonymous threat had been received by the
U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, from a caller who said a bomb
would be planted aboard a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt.
   McArtor said Pan Am's precautions at London's Heathrow Airport,
from which Flight 103 had departed 54 minutes before the crash, were
still under review. British officials at the airport said they had
not been notified about the specific threat.
   At Frankfurt, McArtor said, Pan Am briefed gate personnel about
the possible threat, kept ground baggage handlers and caterers
``under constant surveillance'' and checked all luggage by X-ray
instead of only at random. All passengers and their bags also were
matched prior to boarding, he said.
   President Reagan, leaving the White House for a California
vacation, mourned the victims of the Pan Am disaster and asked
Americans to ``say a special prayer'' this Christmas for families
and friends of those killed in the crash.
   Meanwhile, some aviation safety and crash investigation experts _
though not directly involved in the Pan Am investigation _ suggested
that while the investigation in Scotland may take months the cause
of the crash is expected to be found.
   ``It will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces,'' said
Ronald Schleede, chief of aviation accident investigation at the
National Transportation Safety Board. ``But they're going to solve
it because the evidence will be there.''
   ``We will know what brought down Pan Am 103,'' McArtor said, but
he cautioned ``it could take months.''
   Neither McArtor nor Schleede, who has been briefed daily by
telephone by NTSB officials at the crash site, would discuss
specifically the Pan Am findings so far.
   But Schleede and other experts noted in interviews that the Pan
Am crash investigators have some advantages.
   For example:
   _Most of the aircraft appeared to have escaped serious fire
damage, with the exception of a destroyed right wing where a fuel
tank exploded.
   In many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into
flames, critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that
bends metal and destroys evidence.
   _The wreckage, although strewn across the countryside, is not
exposed to ocean elements that could destroy critical evidence. If
the plane had continued on course it would have been over the
Atlantic in less than an hour.
   _The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were
recovered in apparently good shape.
   In the coming days, investigators will pay close attention to how
parts of the aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there
is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive.
   They also will search for fragments that might have been used as
a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well
as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments. Such holes
leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion, one expert
said.
   Some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible
to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how
the pieces broke apart.
   The flight data recorder, which monitors the performance of the
aircraft, and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined further
and their times coordinated. A key question is whether all of the
plane's electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously, one
veteran investigator said.
   It is known that Flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar
transponder, radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice
recorders, this investigator said.
   If all of these functions failed simultaneously, there is strong
evidence of a massive electrical failure, possibly cause by an
explosion near the forward baggage compartment, which is adjacent to
the electrical and computer systems on the Boeing 747, experts
suggested.

   Comedian Rodney Dangerfield is suing a hotel
chain he claims didn't give him any respect when it hired an actor
to impersonate his voice in radio commercials.
   The commercials for Park Inns International of Irving, Texas,
carried a disclaimer that said the voice was an impersonation of
Dangerfield.
   But the comedian's lawsuit contends the disclaimer wasn't clear
because it was followed by the actor saying Dangerfield-style, ``You
mean this guy ain't a real announcer? He really had me fooled.''
   The advertising campaign was launched in the summer without
permission from Dangerfield or his agent, according to the suit
filed recently in U.S. District Court.
   Daryl Robertson, an attorney for the chain, was unavailable for
comment late Friday. There was no response to a message left with
the hotel's management company, Emerson Management of Dallas.

curtain will come down Jan. 7.
   ``The last couple of weeks, audiences have only been about 40

   Bill Cosby says his efforts to modernize
his mother's kitchen with Christmas presents were for nought _ she
insisted on treating the gifts as trophies.
   ``I tried to give her presents I really thought she needed _ an
electric toaster, a waffle iron, a percolator coffee pot; She loved
them all,'' the comedian said. ``But did she use them? No.
   ``She put them all on top of the refrigerator like they were
trophies from the Olympics and she'd get really mad if anyone took
them down and tried to use them.''
   Cosby, who is to appear at a hotel-casino Jan. 3-8, said he
particularly remembers looking up at a shiny new toaster while
browning bread the hard way.
   ``For years, we still made our toast in the bottom of the oven,''
he recalled recently. ``You put it in, wait a while, then turn it
over and burn your fingers while that terrific stainless steel
toaster ... sat on top of the refrigerator.
   ``My mother was a little strange about Christmas.''

California grape growers.
   Morales, who starred in the 1987 hit movie ``La Bamba,'' accepted
a crucifix made of dried grape vines from union leader Cesar Chavez

   The cross was worn by Chavez, president of United Farm Workers
Union, during his 36-day fast that ended Aug. 21. It has been passed
on since then to politicians and celebrities including the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and Martin Sheen.
   The union claims the pesticides have caused cancer in farm worker
families.
   Morales plans to fast through Christmas Day.

   Former Minnesota Vikings quarterback Joe
Kapp is recuperating from a broken collarbone after being struck by
a taxi while jogging with his dog.
   Kapp, 50, was crossing a street in nearby Los Gatos on Thursday
when a car driven by Festus Banjo, 46, turned a corner and hit Kapp
with its right front bumper, police said.
   Kapp was knocked unconscious and was taken to Valley Medical
Center in San Jose. The dog wasn't hurt.
   ``We're fine,'' Kapp said from his hospital bed Thursday night.
``It was a rainy morning; I didn't see the car at all. I was lucky.
It could have been worse. The last I heard, the car wasn't hurt too
badly.''
   Los Gatos police said Banjo would be cited for violating a
pedestrian's right-of-way.
   Kapp led the Vikings to the Super Bowl in 1970 and later coached
the University of California-Berkeley football team for five years.

<TEXT>
   The second-degree murder conviction of a
woman who claimed the ``baby blues'' caused her to run over her
infant son with a car was set aside Friday by a judge who found the
woman innocent by reason of insanity.
   Sheryl Massip, 24, who testified that post-partum depression
drove her to kill the colicky, constantly crying boy, was not guilty
of murder, said Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald.
   ``I do not believe the prosecution's evidence established that
she had the requisite mental state of malice aforethought,'' the
judge said. He said while he knew his ruling was unusual, he felt he
had no choice.
   Unless overturned on appeal by the prosecution, the judge's
ruling invalidates a Nov. 17 jury verdict of second-degree murder,
which called for a sentence of 15 years to life.
   Fitzgerald delivered what he referred to as an ``unprecedented''
decision: first reducing the charge against her from second-degree
murder to voluntary manslaughter, then ruling that she was not
guilty by reason of insanity. The decision, however, still leaves
the defendant eligible for commitment to a mental hospital for up to
11 years.
   ``This is new ground that we plowed today,'' the judge said in an
interview with the Los Angeles Times after issuing his ruling. ``I
don't know of another court that came to a decision like the one I
ded to set aside the jury verdict altogether.
   ``I know people will say I've overstepped my bounds. But the more
I thought about it, the more I realized I didn't have any choice but
to find her insane. ... She was bonkers.''
   Mrs. Massip welcomed the verdict.
   ``I was praying the people would understand,'' she said outside
court. ``The jury did not understand, but I'm thankful that the
judge did.''
   Mrs. Massip testified at the trial that on April 29, 1987, her
own 23rd birthday, she hit her 6-week-old son, Michael, on the head
with a garden tool, then put him under the wheels of the family
station wagon, ran over him and put his body in a trash can.
   Defense witnesses said an exceptionally bad case of post-partum
depression, a hormonal ailment known as the ``baby blues,'' was to
blame. Defense attorney Milton Grimes said the young mother was
wracked by lack of sleep and hallucinations and that she heard
voices telling her to put the boy out of his misery.

   President Jose Azcona Hoya said
Honduras may file a countersuit against Nicaragua before the U.N.
International Court of Justice.
   His accusation that Nicaragua's Sandinista army has intruded into
Honduran territory, killing soldiers and civilians, came after the
court announced Tuesday it will rule on a complaint filed by
Nicaragua against Honduras on July 28, 1986.
   Azcona said his country is ready to defend itself against
Nicaragua's accusation that Honduras has aided the U.S.-backed
troops, known as the Contras, by allowing them to use Honduran
territory as a staging ground for a war against the Sandinista
government.
   Azcona Hoyo told reporters the decision by the court in The Hague
did not surprise him.
   But, he added, ``We have enough proof that the Sandinista army
has entered Honduran territory. ... We have documented proof of
numerous armed attacks and that have resulted in the death of
Honduran soldiers and civilians.''
   Azcona Hoya said the Contras have taken refuge in Honduras
because they were driven there by the Sandinista army. He said they
are not fighting in Nicaragua now.
   Azcona Hoyo said he considered the Contras to be political
refugees and predicted U.S. aid for them would be renewed in 1989,
after George Bush is inaugurated president.

   Gramercy has a population of 3,600, except for Christmas Eve when
upwards of 40,000 people crowd into town for the lighting of the
bonfires along the Mississippi River levee, Oubre said.
   For 260-plus years the bonfires have blazed to guide Papa Noel
down the Mississippi to the small south Louisiana communities about
30 miles north of New Orleans.
   ``The bonfires are an old tradition passed on from my grandfather
and his grandfather and all the other grandfathers, I guess,'' said
the 65-year-old Oubre, who has been in charge of building the
bonfires for 50 years.
   People began building the structures they'll torch on Christmas
Eve almost a month in advance.
   ``They used to be just simple teepees but about eight years ago
people started getting real imaginative in what they made. Now it's
amazing to see what they come up with,'' Oubre said.
   About 100 bonfires a year in the shape of riverboats, plantation
homes, cabins and Viking ships spring up on the river banks along a
three-mile stretch.
   In fact, the builders' imaginations soared to such heights that
size restrictions were imposed. Bonfires can be no larger than
12-feet wide and no taller than 25 feet.
   ``Those are about the only restrictions,'' Oubre said.
   The crowds attracted by the celebration bring traffic that backs
up for miles along State 44, but Oubre said he doesn't consider it a
problem.
   ``It may be a problem for the folks in the cars, but not for us.
They can only go about three or four miles an hour so it's not
dangerous and they can watch the bonfires just fine,'' he reasoned.
   Not everyone will be stacked up in traffic. At least six river
boats will carry thousands of people upriver from New Orleans to
watch.
   ``This is the second year we've done it, and we sold out before
we even advertised or planned it this year. We added a third boat,
the River Rose, and still have better than 200 people on a waiting
list,'' said Anna Catherine Viator, spokeswoman for New Orleans
Paddlewheels Inc.
   For between $35 and $55, those on the various ships get dinner,
champagne, jazz and about an eight-hour trip, cruise officials said.
   Oubre and his 12-man crew worked almost three weeks to build a
38-foot-long pyre that looks like a shrimp boat. They cut willow
trees, which he said burn best and make a ``beautiful fire,'' and
carefully assembled them.
   Oubre said watching his creations go up in smoke each year isn't
sad in spite of the work and time that go into them.
   ``No, that's why you build them,'' he said. ``You've got it in
mind all the time to see them burn so you look forward to that part
most of all.''

<HEAD>Presents Stolen by Children Turn up Under Neighbors' Tree</HEAD>

   Several children broke into a
neighbor's house in this Florida Panhandle town, stole presents from
underneath a Christmas tree and placed them under their own tree,
authorities said.
   Donald and Dixie Shumpert returned from a shopping trip Wednesday
evening to find a window broken, their Christmas tree toppled and
three presents missing, police said.
   A broken cane fishing pole and a brick were on the floor near the
tree. Deputies say they believe the brick was thrown through the
window and the fishing pole was used to reach inside to pull the
gifts within grabbing range.
   Walton County Sheriff's deputies said they followed three sets of
child-size footprints to a mobile home across the street and
confronted the mother of two of the children.
   ``The deputies knocked on the door and she was kind of surprised
when she saw the presents under the tree,'' Donald Shumpert said
Thursday.
   When the children couldn't explain to deputies or their mother
where the presents came from they admitted they had taken them from
the Shumperts' home, rewrapped them and put them under their own
tree, said sheriff's Sgt. Rick Sutton.
   Also, he said, two bathroom rugs missing from the neighbors' back
porch were wrapped as a Christmas gift.
   The culprits were two boys, ages 9 and 11, and a 12-year-old
girl, Sutton said. The two older children were charged with
burglary, petty theft and criminal mischief and then released to
their parents pending an appearance before a juvenile judge. No
charges were filed against the youngest child.
   The Shumperts said the stolen gifts were intended for their
daughter and two grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   The Canada-U.S. free trade agreement won final
approval early Saturday by a vote of 141-111 in the House of Commons.
   It was the final reading for the trade agreement's enabling
legislation, and the new pact is scheduled to take effect New Year's
Day after approval by the Senate.
   The Senate, which is to complete its work next week, has promised
not to oppose the trade legislation.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose Progessive Conservative
Party won a second consecutive majority government in Nov. 21
elections, signed the trade agreement with President Reagan in
January. The opposition had bitterly opposed the pact, claiming it
would cost Canadians jobs.
   The agreement is to phase out all remaining tariffs between the
two neighbors over a 10-year period.
   A smiling Mulroney said early Saturday that the deal will bring
economic prosperity.
   ``People will look back on this and say it was a good day for
Canada.''

   A 63-year-old homeless man was found dead on a
city sidewalk with $5,200 in cash on him, police said.
   The victim was identified Thursday as Timothy Simmons, based on
fingerprints taken when he was arrested for vagrancy in 1949, said
homicide Detective Paul Marraway. Simmons had no known address in
Pittsburgh.
   Simmons was found Monday in a cubbyhole outside a boiler plant in
a housing complex. He was covered by several blankets, and his feet
were bare.
   Police originally suspected Simmons froze to death, but an
autopsy showed he died of natural causes, said Allegheny County
Deputy Coroner Floyd Coles.
   Officers searched Simmons on the sidewalk and said they found a
wad of bills worth $1,250 in his pocket. The coroner's staff later
found a packet containing $4,000 strapped to his thigh.
   Simmons apparently saved the money from his wages as a laborer
unloading food trucks in the city's produce section, known as the
Strip District.
   The coroner's office is trying to locate Simmons' relatives, who
would inherit the money, Coles said.

<TEXT>
   Bickering between Nicaragua and
Honduras is threatening a summit planned for next month by Central
American leaders anxious to end the civil wars and hostilities in
the region.
   The latest stumbling block comes from the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, Netherlands. The World Court agreed this week
to hear Nicaragua's claims that Honduras has been harboring and
supporting U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, who are fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said Wednesday
the World Court's decision threatens the future of negotiated
settlements to the region's problems. He said the court's move is
politically charged and sets ``a judicial precedent totally
incompatible with peace negotiations.''
   In addition, President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras has
threatened to boycott regional peace talks unless Nicaragua drops
its World Court case.
   Lopez and the foreign ministers of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Costa Rica met earlier this month in Mexico. There
they agreed that heads of state would convene in January in an
effort to breathe new life into the stalled August 1987 peace plan.
   The plan sets three-month deadlines for cease-fires in El
Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala.
   It also mandates that governments of all five nations enact
political amnesties and democratic freedoms and reconcile with
political opposition groups. It calls for an end to outside aid for
rebel insurgencies and a ban on the use of one country's territory
to destabilize another.
   The peace proposal was written by President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica, who was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his effort.
   Honduras says anti-government Nicaraguan rebels and refugees camp
exist on Honduran territory because of a lack of democratic freedoms
in Nicaragua.
   ``For reasons of national security, Honduras doesn't want the
Contras,'' Lopez said. ``Nor do we desire the presence of more than
60,000 refugees from Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua.''
   However, Lopez said Honduras cannot eject the Contras because,
``We would be accused of being responsible for massacres and
violating human rights.''
   Lopez denounced what he called the Sandinista practice of using
international organizations to pressure other nations.
   But Nicaragua hailed the court's decision, and Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega said Honduras should accept it.
   The same court ruled in Nicaragua's favor in 1986 in a suit
against U.S. support of the Contras. The United States has refused
to recognize the court's jurisdiction in the area.
   As the main judicial organ of the United Nations, the court has
no enforcement powers.
   The Arias plan sought to end the Honduran problem as well as long
wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala. But the heady days
following the 1987 signing later turned to disappointment and
frustration.
   The four U.S. allies in Central America _ El Salvador, Honduras,
Costa Rica and Guatemala _ blame Nicaragua and its largest backer,
the Soviet Union, for the persistent turmoil. Nicaragua says the
United States is trying to militarize the region and find a pretext
to invade Nicaragua.
   In both El Salvador and Guatemala, talks between leftist
guerrillas and the two U.S.-backed governments have fallen apart.
Wars rage on with no end in sight.
   In San Salvador on Friday, leftist rebels attacked the Defense
Ministry with car bombs and explosives, killing at least three
people and wounding at least 35, officials said.
   The assault on the military headquarters compound and on a nearby
government health clinic appeared to be part of a major rebel
offensive.
   The regional talks did lead to a cease-fire agreement in
Nicaragua last March that sharply curtailed fighting there. A month
earlier, the U.S. government cut off military aid to the Contras.
   About 10,000 Contra fighters have now moved back to base camps in
Honduras. The presidents last met in Costa Rica on Jan. 15, the date
set by the Arias plan to mark the end of the wars and full democracy.
   Instead, they signed a statement vowing to continue their
efforts. El Salvador's President Jose Napoleon Duarte, whose
government is fighting growing rebel activity, said further meetings
would be useless unless concrete progress could be made.

   A 10,000-gallon propane truck exploded
Friday on a highway, killing seven people, sparking a huge fireball
and sending the tanker crashing into a house 125 yards away,
officials said.
   Six people were admitted to hospitals, including one who later
died and another in critical condition, and five others were treated
and released. A traffic jam caused by the crash led to an accident
that claimed a eighth life.
   ``I heard the explosion and saw the tanker flying through the
air. It fell on the house and just blew up,'' said Marvin Mitchell,
a witness.
   The wood-frame, duplex house was destroyed and a 10-year-old girl
inside died, authorities said. An elderly woman also inside the
house died later of her burns.
   The six other deaths, including the driver of the truck, and most
of the injuries occurred mainly on Interstate 240 near downtown as
the fireball engulfed the truck and several other vehicles, said
fire Capt. Benny McDow.
   The people taken to hospitals suffered mostly from burns, McDow
said. One was listed in critical condition early Saturday in the
burn unit of the Regional Medical Center and four other people were
also hospitalized. O
   Authorities issued tentative identifications, but said dental
records would have to be used for positive identification, because
some of the bodies were so badly burned.
   The propane truck apparently skidded off an exit ramp on
Interstate 240 as the driver tried to turn onto Interstate 40 toward
Arkansas, McDow said. The roadway was dry.
   ``He was trying to exit and lost control and hit a retaining
wall,'' McDow said. ``That exit there is short. It's one of those
tight turns.''
   Jed Tennison, who works at a sheet metal plant near the crash
scene, said he rushed to a highway overpass when he heard the
explosion.
   ``There was a guy on fire rolling on the road and there was
another just lying on the ground where somebody must have put him,''
Tennison said.
   Gaines Tennison, Jed's father and manager of the sheet metal
plant, said he felt the shock of the blast and looked out to see
what had happened.
   ``I thought it was an earthquake,'' he said. ``The whole sky was
white, just lit up. You could feel the heat inside the building.''
   Frank Baker, a deputy chief in charge of fire department crews on
the scene, said victims killed by the blast had little chance to
escape the flames.
   ``There was a huge fireball, maybe 700 to 800 feet. It engulfed
three or four cars,'' Baker said.
   In addition to the destroyed duplex, the fireball damaged five
houses, three on one side and two on the other side of the six-lane
highway, authorities said.
   James Edgeston, who lives two doors away from the destroyed
duplex, said a truck axle with four wheels attached ended up in his
kitchen. He suffered a cut on the head but was not seriously hurt.
   John Stonecipher, a city fire marshal, said the tanker ruptured
on one end and blasted off like a rocket when the fuel ignited. ``It
was like an unguided missile,'' he said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board planned to send a team
of investigators, said Michael Benson, NTSB spokesman in Washington.
   Authorities tentatively identified the victims as Shelanda
Towles, 10, killed in her house; Randall Benson, 29, West Memphis,
Ark., the propane tanker driver; and four people who were in
vehicles near the exploding truck: Harrison G. Lee, 34, Brighton,
Tenn.; Robert Wardlow, 40, Memphis; and Tina Wiles, 30, and her
father-in-law, Warner Wiles, 70, both of Vicksburg, Miss.
   The elderly woman who was inside the duplex with Shelanda was not
identified because her family had not been notified, said police
traffic Lt. James Krepela.
   After the accident, traffic backed up for several miles north and
south of town. A second truck driver was killed when his 18-wheeler
plowed into the rear of a car tied up in the traffic jam, police
said. That driver was identified as David Bailey, 29, of West
Helena, Ark.

   A crack addict desperate for treatment brought
police his paraphernalia, then smashed windows at two precincts
before a judge relented and sentenced him to a drug program he calls
his ``best Christmas gift yet.''
   ``I will thank him for giving me an opportunity for starting my
life back over. He is an understanding man, one of very few,''
Alexis Vega said Friday of Bronx Criminal Court Judge John Moore.
   Vega, 34, said his life had bordered on the insane until Moore
sentenced him to 90 days in a drug treatment program. As a crack
cocaine addict, Vega lost his job as a construction worker. He
stopped paying bills. He became irresponsible and dirty. His wife of
two years, Josephine Coulter, feared for their 11-month-old son and
her two daughters, now 12 and 13.
   Last July, Miss Coulter threw him out of their home in New York
City's tough South Bronx section ``because I was doing wrong,'' he
said. ``She is a Christian and I didn't want to be around her.''
   ``It's bad to see a good husband turn into a monster. I've known
him nine years and I had never seen that side of him,'' Miss Coulter
said. ``I was praying he would get into a program before it was too
late. He was getting out of hand.''
   Vega knew he was getting out of hand, so he turned for help. He
applied for admission at several Bronx hospital programs and one in
Manhattan.
   ``They all told me they were filled up. Until February or the end
of January. That was too far for me to look forward to,'' Vega said.
   On Oct. 28, he sought help from the desk sergeant at the 47th
Precinct. That did not work, so Vega tried something else: He placed
a syringe and some crack vials on the sergeant's desk.
   ``I didn't know what else to do,'' Vega said. ``They roughed me
up. They were very shocked that I did this. They didn't understand.''
   And neither did the judge who handled the case, releasing him two
days later without sending him to treatment.
   On Nov. 5, Vega tossed a chair through the window of the 48th
Precinct. Another judge put him in the streets without treatment.
   On Nov. 14, he threw a padlock through a window of the 46th
Precinct. He was processed by a third judge who did not offer
treatment.
   ``I told them I needed help,'' Vega said.
   All the pending cases of drug charges and criminal mischief came
together Dec. 1 before Moore, who decided to do something.
   ``I got a call from the judge on Tuesday the 20th. From the judge
himself,'' said Luis Sierra, a worker at and graduate of Way Out
Church Ministries Inc.
   ``It was strange. To me, a judge has a lot to do. He went out of
his way to help this particular person. The probation report was not
favorable.''
   Sierra said the program, which is funded by donations and other
churches, has 58 beds and 600 people on the waiting list. One bed
was available and Vega got it. Vega, who had previously written to
the program, was given a 90-day sentence Wednesday to Way Out.
   ``He's got a long way to go here,'' Sierra said. ``It is a strain
on his life. We are a very strict program.''
   ``Strict'' means no leaving the program for two months, no
visitors, no cursing, no smoking and plenty of prayer.
   The Bronx District Attorney, Paul Gentile, commended the judge
and said ``this case dramatizes the critical need for treatment upon
demand for all individuals addicted to drugs.''
   No one knows it better than Vega, who said, ``I think (the judge)
gave me the best Christmas gift yet, to redeem my life back over.''

<TEXT>
   The search for survivors of the
Armenian earthquake is over, and crews will now focus solely on
clearing away tons of concrete and debris so rebuilding can begin, a
government official said.
   No one has been found alive in the mountains of bricks,
splintered wood and steel since Thursday, when workers pulled a
woman from what used to be a building in Leninakan. She later died.
   ``We did everything to sift the ruins to save the lives of
whomever might be under them. At this time, we know that no one can
be alive,'' Vardkes Artsruny, a deputy prime minister of Armenia,
said in an interview Friday.
   ``The gigantic problem now is the cleanup,'' he said, speaking in
makeshift offices previously used as a children's center.
   Lights in the two-story relief headquarters sputtered as he spoke
because of the varying levels of power provided by portable
generators. During a blackout Friday, he met with agricultural
officials by candlelight.
   Fields around Leninakan, whose shoddy buildings collapsed when
the earth shook Dec. 7, are filled with debris. Twisted wire and
remains of stairs protrude from piles of formless rubble trucked
from the Armenian republic's second-largest city.
   Rescuers said a 16-year-old boy was found alive Monday, 12 days
after the quake, in the remains of a nine-story building. A bed
apparently shielded him from tons of concrete raining down.
   One of the boy's arms was broken. He asked rescuers to bandage
his eyes so he wouldn't be blinded when exposed to light after so
many days.
   Leninakan, on a mountain plateau near the Turkish border, had a
population of 280,000 before the quake. About 18,000 people were
found in the ruins, 8,000 of whom survived.
   Survivors taking part in the rescue, aided by 20,000 workers from
elsewhere in the Soviet Union and 15,000 soldiers, live in heated
tents sent from the Russian republic and in yurts, shepherds' tents
sent by Kazakhs and Mongols.
   Workers have nearly completed disinfecting and burying about
80,000 carcasses of cattle, sheep and pigs killed in villages, the
official news agency Tass reported.
   In a dispatch today, Tass estimated agricultural damage to
Armenia at about $3.2 billion. Of 342 populated areas in the quake
zone, 58 were destroyed, Tass said.
   Government officials have said Leninakan, Spitak and the dozens
of other cities and towns of northwestern Armenia destroyed by the
quake will be rebuilt in two years, but Artsruny said it may take
longer.
   ``It's not important that we reconstruct Leninakan in two years
and three months,'' he said. ``It's the fact that we're doing it.''
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, said Friday authorities had
not decided whether to rebuild Leninakan and Spitak on the same
sites or move them to nearby spots less susceptible to earthquakes.
   The quake has brought world figures to Armenia as well as
rescuers.
   President-elect George Bush's son and grandson are scheduled to
visit Armenia on Christmas Day to help distribute American aid. Jeb
Bush, 35, a Miami real estate developer, and his 12-year-old son,
George, will spend about six hours in Yerevan, according to Bush's
office in Washington.
   Most Armenians are devout Christians, but like other members of
Eastern churches, will celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6.
   U.S. aid has come in many forms. American volunteers are putting
up 100 plastic shelters at Spitak, and Tass said American
seismologists were establishing 25 earthquake monitoring stations in
the area of the quake's epicenter.
   In Washington, the American Red Cross said it would shift its
effort from immediate to long-term assistance, including buiding a
hospital. President Richard F. Schubert said the Red Cross has
received $3.5 million in cash contributions and pledges.

<HEAD>Christmas Eve Disaster Still A Touchy Subject</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trampling deaths and suffocations of 73
people on Christmas Eve remain a touchy subject in this town, even
though the tragedy occurred 75 years old today.
   ``I don't suppose it will ever heal,'' said amateur historian
Jack Foster, a resident of Calumet.
   It happened when a false fire alarm was sounded during a party
for children in 1913, at the height of a bitter strike at copper
mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   ``The death certificates blame persons unknown and some of the
stories are so insidious that I understand why over the years people
in the town didn't want to talk about it,'' said Peggy Germain, a
former Calumet council member.
   Even so, the town council voted Tuesday to hold a memorial
service today at the site where the hall once stood. Planned are a
non-denominational prayer service, a candlelight vigil, and the
reading of the victims' names.
   Nobody ever discovered who sounded the false alarm, Foster said.
Union and company supporters blamed each other for the strike
violence they attributed to the disaster.
   Unionized members of the Western Federation of Miners had been on
strike for 10 months over the Calumet and Hecla Mining Co.'s
decision to switch from two-man drills to one-man drills. The WFM
contended the new drill was unsafe.
   In June 1913, more than 14,000 unionized miners and 1,500 mill
and smelter workers were laid off as Calumet and Hecla moved to
reopen its mines with non-union workers, according to an account by
historian Angus Murdock.
   That fall, two company guards chased a striker into a boarding
house in Calumet and fired gunshots, killing two men. The guards
claimed they had been shot at first.
   Then on Dec. 7, three non-union Canadian miners were gunned down
as they slept in a second boarding house. Days later, a miner and a
guard were killed in another shootout.
   It was in that atmosphere that the WFM women's committee held a
Christmas party for the children of striking miners on the second
floor of Calumet's Italian Hall, above a saloon.
   The party was under way, witnesses said, when someone from the
first floor stairwell shouted out a fire alarm.
   Children and adults panicked to escape, tripping over each other
to get into the stairwell and out the only exit. Witnesses said 57
children and 16 adults were crushed to death or suffocated before
anyone realized what was happening.
   ``I was so scared,'' said Lena Rigotti, an 88-year-old Hurley,
Wis., nursing home resident who survived the tragedy. ``I told my
sister, `Stay with me and we'll get home.' I don't know how we ever
made it.'''
   National Guard troops were ordered out to keep the peace, and a
congressional investigation was held. The WFM called a halt to the

   The Japanese coast guard launched a search today in
the Sea of Japan for a Panamanian freighter carrying a crew of 20
that has not been heard from for eight days, officials said.
   Officials of the Maritime Safety Agency said the 16,194-ton
Megataurus with 20 South Korean crew members aboard last reported on
Dec. 16 that when it would be arriving three days late due to poor
weather.
   The ship left Hinatuan, the Philippines, on Dec. 13 carrying
30,000 tons of nickel and was expected to dock at Hachinohe, a
northern Japan port, the officials said.

<HEAD>China White, One of Most Powerful Drugs Known, Triggers New Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>

   Authorities say 18 victims in one of the
nation's longest string of deaths caused by China White, a powerful
synthetic heroin, were at the mercy of dealers who don't check the
quality of drugs they sell.
   ``There's no way to prevent this,'' Allegheny County Coroner
Joshua Perper said. ``Anybody who has the knowledge to produce a
so-called designer drug can cause this sort of thing.''
   The drug, 3-methylfentanyl, has been confirmed as the cause of 18
overdose deaths in the Pittsburgh area, Perper said. Laboratory
tests are under way for five others. The drug also is suspected in
as many as 60 non-fatal overdoses.
   ``Our information from the street is that (dealers) marketed it
as a real powerful heroin,'' Pittsburgh Assistant Police Chief
Chester Howard said. ``They had no idea of its potency. Three
granules are enough for one dose. We consider it one of the most
powerful drugs known.''
   Twelve people have been arrested, including Thomas L. Schaefers,
48, of suburban Aspinwall, a Calgon Corp. chemist suspected as the
source of the narcotic.
   The deaths were the longest series of China White fatalities
outside California, where the drug surfaced 11 years ago.
   ``This is really the first major incident outside of California
from a clandestine laboratory putting material on the street,'' said
Gary Henderson, professor of pharmacology at the University of
California-Davis medical school. ``And it's certainly the most
fentanyl activity we've seen since 1984.''
   Henderson developed a method of testing for the presence of China
White and drugs with similar compositions, fentanyl analogs, in
overdose victims and is helping city, county and federal officials
in Pittsburgh with their investigation.
   China White, also called Persian Heroin and Gasoline Dope, is
several hundred times more powerful than heroin, and even extremely
small amounts can be fatal. It can be manufactured by anyone with a
background in college chemistry, according to the National Institute
on Drug Abuse in Rockville, Md.
   Federal authorities first noticed the presence of China White in
December 1979, when two users died in California, Henderson said.
   Henderson said 115 have people died from fentanyl overdoses in
California, Arizona and Oregon since 1980. The number of annual
deaths in California peaked at 50 in 1984, just before the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration cracked a drug ring in Los Angeles.
Eighteen people died there in 1985, and one died in 1986.
   Most of the dead in the Pittsburgh area were men in their 30s who
took the drug either by itself or with heroin and cocaine, Perper
said. Authorities began investigating after noticing a rash of fatal
and non-fatal overdoses in September, October and November.
   Seven people were arrested Dec. 1, including Schaefers, who lived
with his elderly parents and had no record of prior involvement with
illegal drugs, investigators said.
   All seven were charged with manufacturing and distributing the
drug. Four were charged with supplying the dose that killed Jay A.
Duschl, 38, of Verona on June 2 and injured Brenda Drennan, 29,
formerly of Harmar on May 22. Three are charged with selling the
dose that killed Daniel Kostopodis, 41, of Bellevue on July 24.
   Five others suspected to be lower-level dealers were arrested in
November.
   Schaefers has been suspended without pay pending results of the
investigation, Calgon spokesman Tom Erdner said.

   A renowned molecular biologist from Indiana
was among the passengers aboard Pan Am Flight 103 when it exploded
and crashed near Lockerbie, Scotland, killing everyone aboard.
   Irving S. Sigal, 35, was returning to his home in Pennington
Borough, N.J., when the plane crashed Wednesday, family members in
Indianapolis said. He had delivered a lecture before the Royal
Biochemical Society of London.
   Sigal was the senior director of molecular biology at the Merck
Sharp & Dohme Laboratories of Westpoint, Pa. Friends said his
principal area of concentration was in AIDS research.
   He had also made great strides in cancer research, having seen
both his parents die of cancer when he was young. His father, Dr.
Max V. Sigal, was a senior scientist at pharmaceutical giant Eli
Lilly and Co.
   Alvine Levine, a professor at Indiana University School of
Medicine, described Sigal as among the most brilliant people he had
ever known.
   ``After spending 35 years to prepare himself, he was just
arriving to where he could make a contribution to humanity, and now
he has been removed,'' said Levine. ``It is a loss in a dimension of
human values that is truly immeasurable.''
   Sigal attended North Central High School in Indianapolis and
graduated from Indiana University. He earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry
at Harvard University.
   After joining Merck in 1982, he established a program to study
the structure and function of proteins using techniques he had
helped develop. Family members said his work was leading to major
insights into the function of an oncogene protein, an enzyme that
plays a role in many human cancers.
   The dead also included several government officials, business
executives, 35 students taking part in a Syracuse University study
abroad program and others coming home for the holidays.

<HEAD>Pacific Storm Pushes Rain, Snow into Oregon, Northern California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading edge of a winter storm was spreading rain into
western Oregon and Northern California early today and was expected
to blow a white Christmas into several western states.
   Mild weather predominated east of the Rockies and rain covered a
wide part of the nation's midsection from southern Illinois to the
Gulf Coast.
   The Pacific Coast storm was expected to intensify today as it
moves inland, triggering storm warnings for snow and high winds in
several states.
   In Oregon and California, a winter storm warning was in effect
for the Cascade, Siskiyou, Shasta and Sierra Nevada mountains, and
for southwest and eastern sections of Oregon. Heavy snow was falling
in the mountains of Oregon early today.
   The coastal mountains of California could get 2 to 4 inches of
rain, with 1 to 2 feet of snow likely at elevations above 7,000 feet
and gusts of up to 50 mph forecast.
   A winter storm warning also was in effect for southern and
central Idaho, with winds up to 30 mph expected. A winter storm
warning also was in effect for the western mountains of Nevada.
   A low pressure system threatened Wisconsin with some heavy snow,
with up to 6 inches expected in the southern part of the state.
   Rain and fog covered much of the central and eastern states.
   A line of showers and thunderstorms extended from southern
Illinois to northern Louisiana. Thunderstorms in Arkansas produced
pea-size hail at Swifton and marble-size hail at Patterson late
Friday.
   Showers also doused extreme southern Florida early today and the
Carolina coast, and fog was widespread from the central Gulf Coast
to New England.
   Today's forecast called for rain and thunderstorms from the
eastern Great Lakes to western New England, the Middle Atlantic
states, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the central Gulf Coast.
Rain also was likely along the northern and central Pacific Coast,
the central California valleys and Southern California.
   Snow was predicted in the Cascades of Washington and Oregon, the
Sierra Nevada in California, and in much of Nevada, Utah, Idaho and
eastern portions of Washington and Oregon. Snow also was forecast
for the upper Great Lakes and the lower Missouri Valley.
   Highs in the 30s or 40s were forecast for much of the nation.
Highs were expected to be in the 20s from the northern Plateau
through the central Rockies, the middle Missouri Valley into
northwest Wisconsin and western upper Michigan; between 10 and 20
degrees in the northern Plains and northern Minnesota; the 50s and
60s from the central and southern California coast through much of
Texas, the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys to the Middle Atlantic
coast; and in the 70s over southern Texas, along the Gulf Coast and
across Florida and southeast Georgia.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 3 degrees below zero at
Glasgow, Mont., to 73 degrees at Homestead and West Palm Beach, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 58 fog; Boston 34 fog; Buffalo 38 fair;

<HEAD>Amazon Ecologist Slain In Jungle Two Weeks After Threatened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internationally acclaimed
ecologist who led a fight to save Brazil's tropical forests was
ambushed and killed in a remote jungle village, police said.
   The victim, 44-year-old Francisco Mendes, said two weeks ago that
his life had been threatened.
   Mendes was shot Thursday night when he stepped outside his home
in Xapuri, a western village near the Bolivian border, said Federal
Police Chief Mauro Sposito.
   Mendes was playing dominos with friends and two police bodyguards
assigned to care for him when he went to take a shower in an outdoor
stall, Sposito said in a telephone interview from Rio Branco, 2,650
miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Moments later, Mendes was shot once in the upper chest with a
rifle at point-blank range, the chief said. The killers fled before
the bodyguards could leave the house, he said.
   The shooting occurred a half-block from the local police precinct.
   Police made no arrests and said there were no definite suspects.
   ``There was no way to stop them (the killers),'' Nilson Alves, a
Xapuri police officer, told The Associated Press by telephone. ``It
was starting to get dark, we only had one search lamp, and the
jungle is pretty thick in these parts.''
   Mendes was known worldwide for leading a campaign against Amazon
rain forest destruction. He was a representative for the World Bank
in Washington and other international lending institutions in
Britain and West Germany and tried to stop loans to Brazil for
development of the region.
   Mendes said he received repeated death threats for organizing
demonstrations against deforestation of the Amazon rain forest by
cattle ranchers and was under local police protection.
   In June 1987, he was honored by the United Nations for leading
members of a local union in a fight to preserve the Amazon jungle.
   The Rubber Tappers Union often staged peaceful ``empate,'' or
stalemate demonstrations, by standing in front of bulldozers with
family members and friends in areas where acres of forestland were
being cleared for grazing.
   Two union members were fatally shot in October.
   On Dec. 9, Mendes told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro he had
received death threats from Darly and Alvarnho Alves, brothers and
ranch owners who had past conflicts with the Rubber Tappers Union.
   The debate over how to develop the Amazon jungle, a vast expanse
of rain forest about two-fifths the size of the continental United
States, has led to frequent violence.
   Land disputes involving squatters, environmentalists and
landowners have caused about 250 deaths a year since 1985.
   Mendes, who is survived by a wife and two children, is to buried
today in Xapuri.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Jury's Murder Verdict Against `Baby Blues' Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A murder conviction returned against a
mother who admitted killing her ailing son by running him over with
a car was rejected by a judge who said the woman was driven insane
by post-childbirth depression.
   Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald, in announcing his
ruling, said he believed Sheryl Massip, 24, was made insane by what
some health experts call postpartum depression or ``baby blues.''
   ``I know people will say I've overstepped my bounds,'' Fitzgerald
told a stunned Orange County courtroom as he announced the decision
Friday. ``But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I
didn't have a choice but to find her insane. ... She was bonkers.''
   Prosecutors said they will review whether an appeal can be filed
on grounds that Fitzgerald's ruling went beyond his authority.
   ``We believe, on a cursory review of material, that he exceeded
his authority,'' Deputy District Attorney Tom Borris said. ``We
believe the best that he could have done is order a new trial.''
   Borris also said Fitzgerald didn't first inform attorneys about
his decision, as judges often do when they are about to issue a
reversal.
   The judge said afterward that he had not decided what the ruling
would be until the moment he delivered it.
   Ms. Massip, 24, had been convicted of second-degree murder.
Fitzgerald reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter, but then
ruled that she was not guilty by reason of insanity, essentially
negating the voluntary manslaughter conviction.
   She still faces a maximum sentence of 11 years confinement in a
mental hospital. Her jury conviction called for 15 years to life in
prison.
   The judge ordered Ms. Massip to surrender Feb. 3 for at least 90
days of psychiatric observation. He then will decide if she needs
further treatment.
   Ms. Massip's family burst into cheers after the decision, which
came during a hearing originally scheduled for her sentencing on the
murder conviction.
   ``I couldn't have asked God for a better Christmas present,''
said Ms. Massip, who read a Bible before the decision. ``I got the
gift of life.''
   Her former husband, Alfredo Massip, whom she testified refused to
help care for the child, fled the court in tears and refused to talk
to reporters. He divorced Ms. Massip shortly after her arrest.
   During her trial, Ms. Massip admitted killing her 6-week old son,
Michael. But she testified that the child cried 15 to 18 hours a
day, adding that she heard voices telling her to put the infant out
of his misery.
   Experts summoned to testify by her lawyer said she had a severe
case of postpartum depression, brought on by hormonal imbalance
sometimes associated with childbirth.
   The rare disorder is believed to spur severe anxiety, delusions
and even violence in approximately three of every 1,000 new mothers.
   On April 29, 1987, Ms. Massip's 23rd birthday, she tried to toss
the child in front of a car near her Fullerton home, but the driver
swerved and missed him.
   She then beat the infant on the head and finally placed him
face-up under the tire of her Volvo station wagon and ran him over.
   After the killing, she first told investigators the child had
been stolen by a red-haired mystery woman with a gun.
   But the child's body was found in a trash can.
   ``The pain hasn't gone away. I have to live with the death of my
son, the loss of my son, for the rest of my life,'' Ms. Massip said
after the ruling. ``I pray that this doesn't happen to anyone else.''
   The judge's decision came after an impassioned plea from defense
attorney Milton Grimes.
   ``There's nothing in human experience that can justify what
Sheryl Massip did ... other than the fact that she was crazy at the
time,'' Grimes argued.

   British transportation minister Paul
Channon is vacationing in the Caribbean, drawing angry cries from
home because his department is in charge of investigating the Pan Am
jet crash in Scotland.
   ``It is unbelievable,'' said John Prescott of Britain's
opposition Labor Party on Friday, after Channon left for Barbados.
Channon and his wife, Ingrid, made no comment after landing later
Friday in Bridgetown.
   Channon was seen checking in with Mustique Airways and was
believed to be flying to Mustique, a tiny island about 40 miles away
that is a popular and exclusive getaway spot.
   ``It is quite intolerable and totally insensitive for the
transport secretary to leave for his holidays so soon after
Britain's worst aviation disaster, when bodies are still being
retrieved and a major security review is under way,'' said Prescott,
his party's transport spokesman.
   Investigators are still searching for dozens of bodies and for
clues to what caused Pan Am Flight 103 to break apart in the air
Wednesday night. The Boeing 747 plummeted into the Scottish village
of Lockerbie, killing all 258 people on board and leaving 20 people
on the ground missing and feared dead.
   The British Embassy in Barbados said it had no information on
Channon's visit because he was not on official business.
   In London, the Trade Ministry said Channon would be kept informed
on the investigation and planned to return soon after Christmas but
would fly home earlier if necessary.
   Prescott said Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative prime minister,
should ``call him back immediately'' and declared: ``Such lack of
judgment should justify his removal.''
   Geoffrey Dickens, a Conservative member of Parliament, said Labor
was ``trying to make capital out of other people's misery and
death.''

   Investigators today were analyzing a
faint noise heard in the final moments of a cockpit tape-recording
for clues to whether a bomb downed Pan Am Flight 103 while it was
flying six miles above Scotland.
   ``There were no abnormal noises on the tape until the signals
ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at 31,000 feet,'' said
Paul McKie, a spokesman for the Department of Transport whose Air
Accident Investigation Branch is studying the tapes.
   Nothing in the cockpit conversations preceding the Wednesday
night crash was unusual until the ``faint noise at the end, which
needs a bit more analysis,'' he said.
   NBC News quoted unidentified U.S. officials as saying the top CIA
official in Beirut, Lebanon, was on the jet. The report Friday night
did not name the CIA official, and the White House and State
Department refused comment on whether a CIA official was on the
plane.
   The search continued today for bodies and clues, and police said
there would be no break for Christmas.
   David Learmount, a respected aviation editor at Flight
International, the industry magazine, said the ``black box''
recording supported the theory that a bomb caused the crash, which
killed all 258 people aboard and devastated the Scottish village of
Lockerbie with its flaming wreckage.
   Twenty townspeople were missing and feared dead, including
drivers of three cars caught in the inferno.
   ``The black boxes have told us that it was an instantaneous
catastrophe. That is why the bomb theory's very much the favorite,''
Learmount told Independent Television News on Friday night.
   ``The bomb theory explains everything which happened. ... If this
case was just simple metal fatigue failure, it would have had to
have been cataclysmic, really extraordinarily unlikely. But if it
did happen, we really have to know and know fast,'' he said.
   But Mick Charles, head of a team of 40 U.S. and British
investigators at the site, said, ``We have no evidence whatsoever
yet of sabotage.''
   Strong suspicions of a terrorist bombing built swiftly following
an Iranian group's claim of responsibility, the revelation that the
U.S. government had been warned of a threat against a Pan Am plane,
and the fact the plane suddenly broke apart in flight.
   Anger at the government's failure to notify the public of the
threat _ against a Pan Am jet flying from Frankfurt to New York
sometime in December _ surfaced Friday when it became known the
United States notified Britain.
   The government's reticence meant ``the poor, ignorant traveling
public taking greater risks,'' charged John Prescott of the
opposition Labor Party. Anthony Beaumont-Dark of the governing
Conservatives agreed.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo, responding to the criticism,
said the threat, phoned in to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki on Dec.
5, was ``confidential, classified U.S. intelligence information and
we didn't have the right to divulge it.''
   Heathrow Airport's security for American flights was reviewed and
determined to be strict enough not to warrant divulging the
anonymous threat, Portillo said on British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
   Victims' relatives began to arrive in Lockerbie, a community of
2,500, to claim their dead. Seven Americans were among the arrivals,
who were being counseled by social workers.
   Makeshift morgues in the town hall and in an ice rink have
received 155 bodies, and the search goes on.
   Wreaths appeared outside the morgues. One bouquet, from a
passenger who took Flight 103 from Frankfurt to London, was to a
child flying on to New York.
   ``To the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made my
flight from Frankfurt such fun. You didn't deserve this,'' the note
said.
   Officers hacked open the nose section of the plane, which lay on
its side in a field, and troops carried away the bodies of the crew.
   Fourteen adults and three children from Lockerbie remained
unaccounted for and there was no word on the occupants of three cars
hit by wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway, Police
Superintendent Angus Kennedy said.
   The missing toll had been 22, but one man was found to have been
treated for injuries Wednesday and released, and another was
accidentally listed twice as missing.
   More than 600 troops and police, assisted by rescue experts and
dogs, criss-crossed wide areas of the countryside looking for bodies
and any fragment that might help explain the crash.
   An Air India jumbo jet bound for New York with 250 people aboard
returned to London on Friday afternoon after Air India in New York
received an anonymous bomb threat, officials said.
   It was evacuated at Heathrow, but the airline announced nothing
suspicious was immiedately found. Passengers were offered seats on a
flight today.

   Newspapers today published Christmas
letters to American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland
and to British captive John McCarthy from their family and friends.
   The U.S.-based Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson
urged the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Islamic Jihad to free the
journalist and Sutherland ``in the name of humanity.''
   ``As Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland face their fourth
Christmas and New Year holidays as hostages, we, their friends and
colleagues, ask you once again in the name of humanity to set them
and others you are holding free,'' the committee said in a 20-line
letter.
   An Arabic translation was published by five of Lebanon's 14 daily
papers.
   The independent An-Nahar and conservative Ad-Diyar also published
the original English text in the apparent hope Anderson and
Sutherland would be allowed to read it. The two men did not know
Arabic when they were kidnapped.
   Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held of the
15 foreign hostages. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut when he was
abducted June 9, 1985.
   The letter noted that on July 24, Lebanon's most prestigious
Shiite religious leader, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
``acknowledged the human suffering of the foreign hostages in
Lebanon and said that the time has come for a happy ending to their
plight.''
   ``At this special time of year, we ask that you consider Sheik
Fadlallah's words and bring an end to this tragedy for the foreign
hostages and their families,'' it said.
   Fadlallah is the reputed mentor of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, believed to be the umbrella for Islamic Jihad and
other factions holding hostages.
   Fadlallah on Friday reiterated his call for the release of the
hostages on condition that Iranian, Palestinian and Lebanese
captives held by Lebanese Christians, the Israelis and their allies
were also freed.
   ``There should be no distinction among kidnap victims,''
Fadlallah said at a sermon in southern Beirut.
   ``Let the cry be for the release of all hostages with no
discrimination. Let's treat the case from its humanitarian angle.
Let us preserve the humanity of all the captives.''
   Three Iranians and their Shiite driver were seized by militiamen
of the right-wing Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia,
when they drove across the Christian enclave north of Beirut during
the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
   All are believed dead.
   Israel and its militia allies of the South Lebanon Army hold
hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese Shiites.
   The journalists' committee called on the kidnappers to ``please
relay to Terry and Tom and others that they are not forgotten.
   ``Their friends and families pray for them every day and there
are many people who work every day for the time when they are free
and return to the light and the love of their families.''
   It said that the kidnappers' ``serious consideration of this
request is appreciated by many. We hope that the new year brings
peace to all the peoples of Lebanon.''
   Beirut's leftist As-Safir daily published letters in English to
McCarthy, a producer for the London-based Worldwide Television News.
They were paid for by his parents and friends.
   McCarthy, 32, of Barnet, north London, was kidnapped April 17,
1986.
   A three-line message signed by his parents said: ``All our love
John. Happy Christmas and we're sure we'll see you soon.''
   McCarthy's fiancee, Jill Morell, wrote: ``Darling John, we are
spending another Christmas wishing you were here with us.
   ``Don't despair. Try to keep your spirits up and be sure you'll
be home with us soon.''
   A friend of McCarthy's, identified only as Sean, wrote: ``You are
in our thoughts and prayers.''

<HEAD>Play Closing after Co-Producer Recently Disclosed To Be In Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Broadway comedy ``Checkmates'' is to close
Jan. 1, less than three weeks after it was revealed that a
co-producer is serving a 28-years-to-life prison term in
California's San Quentin for attempted murder.
   The United States Attorney's office in Los Angeles has also
indicted the co-producer, Michael Harris, on drug conspiracy charges.
   The play, a comedy about two married couples in an apartment
building, opened Aug. 4 and will have had 177 regular performances
and 17 previews when it closes. It stars Ruby Dee, Paul Winfield,
Denzel Washington and Marsha Jackson.
   A production spokesman, Adrian Bryan-Brown, said poor box-office
receipts led the show's two remaining producers to decide to close
it. The decision was also based on Washington's intention to leave
the show to do a movie, and his stand-by's television project, the
spokesman said.
   Harris, 26, who with a partner put up half of the $770,000 it
cost to take the show to Broadway, received producer's billing on
posters for the comedy until it was revealed earlier this month that
he had been convicted of killing a man he accused of stealing from a
drug operation.
   The play was originally produced in Los Angeles by Harris and
Hayward Collins. When it opened in New York, its producers also
included James M. Nederlander, James L. Nederlander and Philip Rose.
The Nederlanders withdrew in September after disappointing reviews
and ticket sales.

   Fuel oil darkened the sand at this
resort town and soaked at least 50 birds after an oil spill of at
least 70,000 gallons from a ship collision left a slick 30 miles
long, authorities said.
   Authorities closed 1{ to 2 miles of beach in the area near here
along the central Washington coast, where oiled birds were found.
The area contains numerous wetlands and marshes that are home to
migratory waterfowl.
   The collision occurred Thursday night after a towline snapped in
heavy seas, causing a tugboat from Sause Bros. Ocean Towing Inc., of
Coos Bay, Ore., to collide with the barge Nestucca.
   Authorities estimated 70,000 gallons of oil leaked from the barge
off Grays Harbor by late Friday, said Bob Steelquist of the state
Department of Wildlife, and Coast Guard officials said more was
escaping as the vessel pitched and tossed in 15-foot swells about 25
miles off the coast.
   In Portland, Ore., Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Guy Nolan said the spill
was about 30 miles long and 100 feet wide. No damage or cleanup cost
estimate was immediately available.
   Global Diving and Salvage Inc. of Seattle was hired by Sause
Bros. to clean up the mess, said Karen Johnson of the state Ecology
Department.
   The leaking barge was towed south Friday night to the mouth of
the Columbia River, which separates Oregon and Washington. Company
and government officials were planning to decide today whether to
try to make repairs at sea or tow the barge to a port on the river.
   Grays Harbor County Sheriff Dennis Morrisette closed a mile and a
half of beaches as state Ecology Department officials prepared a
rescue effort for oil-soaked birds. At least 50 oil-soaked birds had
been found by late Friday.
   ``The latest reports I'm getting indicate an average of 12 dead
or distressed birds are being found every quarter of a mile along
the beach,'' said Mark Stewart of the state Division of Emergency
Management.
   Western Wildlife Rescue and Volunteers for Outdoor Washington
established a bird-cleaning and recovery operation Friday at Our
Lady of Good Help Catholic Church in Hoquiam.
   Morrisette, who doubles as county director of emergency services,
said the sand was darker than normal in the area.
   The Nestucca carried 2.7 million gallons of oil, but the only
reported damage was a gash about 18 inches below the main deck in a
tank containing about 250,000 gallons.

   Northwest Airlines officials searched a Los
Angeles-bound jet for explosives to calm passenger fears that a
woman who deplaned had left a bomb on the jet.
   Flight 335 had backed away from the gate at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport Friday when the woman, saying she was sick, asked to be
allowed off the plane, said another passenger, Associated Press
sports writer Harry Atkins.
   The jet returned, and when she got off, some other passengers
asked to get off and insisted that the plane be searched, Atkins
said.
   Their wish was granted, delaying the flight for 1\ hours.
   ``There were some passengers who believed the lady got on with
three pieces of carry-on luggage and was getting off with two,''
said Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons. ``Just to be cautious, we
asked everyone to get off the plane. We searched it. And found
nothing.
   ``As it turned out, she got on with two,'' said Gibbons. ``We put
everyone back on the plane and away it went.''
   He said he believed Wednesday's crash of Pan Am's Flight 103,
which killed all 258 people on board when it went down in Scotland,
has put passengers on edge.
   ``I think everyone has their thoughts with the people with Pan
Am,'' Gibbon said.

<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization and
the Shiite Moslem Amal militia have reached a new peace pact to end
their bloody 3-year conflict, Beirut newspapers reported today.
   The papers published the 11-point pact, which is the sixth since
1985 when Amal moved against Palestinian refugee camps to prevent
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat from rebuilding a power base in Lebanon.
   The five earlier accords fell apart, and there is widespread
doubt the latest accord will hold.
   More than 3,000 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded in the
Amal-PLO conflict.
   Amal has an estimated 10,000 armed militiamen. The PLO has 4,500
guerrillas based in the Sidon region, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Syria, which supports Amal, last month withdrew 66 truce
observers from the highlands east of Sidon. That raised fears of
major clashes, but so far only localized skirmishes have occurred.
   The new pact provides for a disengagement of forces and the
removal of frontline barricades to enforce a cease-fire between Amal
and the PLO around Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon.
   The conflict has centered on the city and its environs since
Arafat's fighters were driven out of their strongholds in Beirut's
refugee camps by rival Syrian-backed Palestinian factions in July,
something Amal had failed to do.
   Amal and the PLO pledged in the accord to resolve friction by
peaceful means and reopen all roads in the region for unrestricted
movement.
   The accord stipulated that Amal should lift its 3-year siege of
the Rashadiyeh refugee camp in the southern port of Tyre. About
18,000 Palestinians live there.
   It also provided for repairing the devastation in Sidon's Ein
el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh camps and repatriating thousands of
displaced Palestinians and Shiites in the region.
   The leftist Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which has stayed
neutral in the Amal-PLO conflict, will oversee the new cease-fire.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Says He'll Return Body Of American Killed In 1986 Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi said he is willing to hand over
the body of a U.S. pilot killed during the 1986 air raid on Libya,
the official news agency JANA reported today.
   Gadhafi said the body of Capt. Paul Lorence would be given to his
family ``through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in London
and Rome.
   Lorence, 31, of San Francisco, and Fernando Ribas-Dominicci, 33,
of Utuado, Puerto Rico, were in an F-111 that disappeared during the
April 15, 1986, raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. The other 17 U.S. Air
Force bombers returned safely to their bases after dropping about
100 tons of bombs on the two cities.
   The attack was in retaliation for what the Reagan administration
said was Libya's support for international terrorism. Libyan
authorities said the raids killed about 40 people, including
Gadhafi's 15-month-old adopted daughter.
   ``The brother leader has also invited the family of the U.S.
pilot (Capt. Paul) Lorence, whose plane was shot down during the
failed U.S. barbaric and savage attack on Tripoli and Benghazi ...
to take possession of his body which will be handed through the pope
(of the Vatican), especially since this occasion coincides with the
end of the rule of the Reagan administration, the `murderer of
children,''' the JANA dispatch said.
   It said he made the comments to a group of Arab Christians.
   At the Vatican, deputy spokesman Giovanni D'ercole said the Roman
Catholic Church had no immediate comment.
   After the 1986 raids, diplomats in Libya said Gadhafi was
demanding a ransom or concessions from the United States before
returning the airman's body.
   Three months after the attack, Libyan television showed pictures
of a body it said was Lorence.
   Western witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crash into the
Mediterranean Sea soon after being hit, apparently by a missile,
during the raid on Tripoli.
   Relations between the United States and Libya have been more
strained than usual lately. President Reagan has charged Libya has
constructed a plant to produce chemical weapons, and has said
Washington was talking with its allies about a possible attack on
the facility.
   Gadhafi has claimed the plant produces pharmaceuticals.

   One thousand homeless people sleeping in
chilly Skid Row doorways and on grimy sidewalks were awakened in the
middle of the night by police, only to find the officers were
bearing blankets instead of billy clubs.
   The officers were among the host of Americans playing Santa Claus
at Christmastime, including a cigar-puffing Mercedes-Benz driver who
passed out thousands of dollars to Skid Row denizens here and a man
who bailed eight prisoners out of a New York state jail.
   Los Angeles police Capt. Carley Mitchell bought special
waterproof, insulating blankets with $240 of his own money, then
passed them out early Friday to the street dwellers, many of whom
had little more than strips of cardboard to protect them.
   ``I was hoping I could keep some people warm for the holidays and
make Christmas a little better for them,'' said Mitchell, who runs
the Police Department's training academy.
   Mitchell said he staged the giveaway in the middle of the night
to make sure the blankets got to those who really needed them and to
avoid the news media.
   ``I didn't want it to be any big deal, just a concerned citizen
in street clothes doing something on his own time,'' he said.
   Later Friday in Skid Row, a hoard of homeless people were handed
$10 bills by a self-styled Santa puffing a stogie, driving a
Mercedes-Benz and wearing a bright red three-piece suit and a
crimson fedora.
   The giveaway at the Midnight Mission came a day after the seventh
annual visit there by a secretive philanthropist known as the
Cadillac Santa, who also hands out cash.
   ``The guy in the Mercedes said he read about the Cadillac Santa
and thought he could do better,'' said mission spokesman Clancy
Imislund.
   However, the Cadillac-driving benefactor spent about twice as
much as the $3,000 or so his imitator handed out, Imislund said.
   Imislund said the Mercedes Santa's red suit, red tie and red
fedora were ``the most God-awful getup you could imagine, but his
heart was in the right place and nobody cared what he was wearing.
   ``He was ho-ho-hoing like nobody's business and just like the
other one, wouldn't reveal who he is,'' the spokesman said.
   In Manhasset, N.Y., just east of New York City, Sal Miglio spent
$2,000 to bail out seven women and one man who would otherwise have
spent Christmas in the Nassau County Jail and gave them a choice of
toys to bring home to their children.
   ``To be in jail just because you can't make bail of a couple of
hundred dollars just doesn't make sense,'' said Miglio, a
55-year-old developer playing Good Samaritan for the 14th year in a
row.
   The prisoners were chosen through interviews with Miglio and by
recommendations from jail workers, counselors and police. The crimes
involved are usually petty larceny, trespassing or shoplifting, said
Sheriff Joseph Jablonsky.
   At the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, Ind., inmates
collected $1,700 to buy more than 1,000 Christmas toys for needy
children in hospitals and elsewhere in town.
   ``We're saying, `Just because we're here, that doesn't mean we
don't have a heart,''' said inmate Billy Hicks, who is chairman of
the toy project.
   The prisoners raised the money through donations and by
collecting aluminium cans for sale at a recycling site, said Hicks.
   ``In some way, I would say that just about every one of the 1,600
or so men in the prison population helped with the project,'' he
said. ``We've been working on this since about July.''

   A leader of the governing Jatiya Party
was fatally shot in a resort town by a suspected Buddhist Chakma
rebel, officials said today.
   Shantimay Dewan, 62, was shot by a lone gunman in a crowded
bazaar in Rangamati on Wednesday and died Friday, doctors at a
military hospital said when contacted by telephone.
   Dewan had been helping the government in peace talks with the
Chakma rebels. He was the chairman of the Rangamati subdistrict
council, the local adminstrative body.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thought
hardcore rebels who oppose the peace talks were behind the attack.
   The tribal rebels have been campaigning for a separate state in
the Chittagong Hill Tracts, which adjoin the Indian states of
Tripura and Mizoram. The rebels claim their cultural identity has
been eroded by Moslem settlers.
   About 90 percent of Bangladesh's 110 million people are Moslems.
   The government says at least 2,000 armed rebels operate in the
region, organizing hit-and-run attacks against army patrols and
Moslem settlers. At least 4,000 people have been killed in the
fighting since 1974, three years after Bangladesh became an
independent nation.
   The government has been conducting peace talks with moderates
among the rebels for two years.
   At least 50,000 Chakmas have fled to India to avoid violence,
Indian officials say.

   The daughter of a radio traffic reporter who was
killed in a helicopter crash while on the air will receive $325,000
in a settlement rather than face the agony of a trial, her lawyer
says.
   Naomi Knickerbocker, 19, is the only child of reporter Jane
Dornacker, 39, who was killed in 1986.
   Miss Knickerbocker's attorney, James Molesky of Oakland, Calif.,
said a court fight might have gained his client more money, but said
she wanted to dispose of the matter because, she said, her mother's
``tragic death has been most difficult and painful'' for her.
   The settlement was approved Dec. 14 by Manhattan Surrogate Court
Judge Marie M. Lambert. It was disclosed on Friday.
   Ms. Dornacker, who came to New York from San Francisco, was
broadcasting a traffic report for WNBC radio when the helicopter in
which she was riding crashed into the Hudson River.
   As the chopper plunged toward a pier, listeners heard Ms.
Dornacker scream at the pilot, ``Hit the water! Hit the water!''
   Ms. Dornacker's body was pulled from the submerged helicopter
about 10 minutes later.
   Spectrum Helicopters of Ridgefield Park, N.J., owners and
operators of the crashed aircraft, will pay $250,000 of the
settlement. The remaining $75,000 will be paid by Enstrom Helicopter
Corp. of Menominee, Mich., manufacturers of the chopper, and the
Formsprag Industrial Power Transmission division of Dana Corp.,
makers of the helicopter's failed transmission.

   A passenger train bound for Beijing crashed into a
bus packed with peasants, killing at least 45 people and injuring
67, national television reported today.
   The accident, in northeastern China's Liaoning province, occurred
Friday at about 8 p.m., the news program said.
   The report said 84 peasants were heading home to Inner Mongolia
when the bus they were riding in crossed the railroad tracks in
Liaoning.
   The Dandong-to-Beijing train crashed into the bus, crushing the
vehicle, the report said. The locomotive also left the track and
overturned.
   The TV showed a row of bodies and said many of the injured were
in critical condition. It said police were investigating the cause
of the accident. The report did not specify whether all the dead
were from the bus.
   The report also showed the bus, which was mangled almost beyond
recognition.
   Train service was restored to the line this morning, the report
said.
   So far this year, there have been four other major train wrecks,
including a derailment in Yunnan province in January that left 88
dead.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat and the PLO's executive
committee gathered today for a meeting to discuss forming a
provisional government for the newly declared independent
Palestinian state.
   The closed-door meeting was scheduled amid growing opposition by
radical Palestinian factions and some figures within the Palestine
Liberation Organization to Arafat's recent peace initiative.
   The PLO chairman has explicitly recognized Israel and renounced
terrorism.
   PLO officials said Arafat met with senior aides in the Iraqi
capital before the meeting.
   Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 15-member
committee will discuss last week's talks between the PLO and the
United States, efforts to convene an international Middle East peace
conference, and the formation of the provisional Palestinian
government.
   The PLO chief in Baghdad, Azzam al-Ahmad, told The Associated
Press on Friday that the executive committee will also review the
year-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories
and ``ways of escalating resistance to the occupation forces.''
   The sources said the provisional government might not be named
during the meeting of the executive committee because ``further
consultations may be needed.''
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
declared the Palestinian state at a meeting last month.
   Scores of countries have recognized the still-symbolic
Palestinian state. PLO officials said that while Arafat is in
Baghdad, he will lay the cornerstone of a Palestinian embassy
building in the Iraqi capital.
   Arafat arrived in Baghdad late Friday after flying from Rome,
where he met with Pope John Paul II and with Italian Prime Minister
Ciriaco De Mita and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti.
   Those attending the Baghdad meeting included Mustafa el-Zibri,
deputy leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, who has bitterly condemned Arafat's moves.
   El-Zibri is the front's sole representative on the executive
committee, which includes three members of Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction, the biggest of the several guerrilla groups in the PLO.
   Those groups are also represented on the committee, which
includes various other non-guerrilla Palestinian organizations and
independents.
   The front's leader, George Habash, reluctantly endorsed Arafat's
moves at the Palestine National Council meeting to preserve unity.

   A 10,000-gallon propane truck burst into a
fireball and blasted off ``like an unguided missile,'' smashing into
a house 125 yards away, killing two people inside and five
motorists, authorities said.
   The tanker skidded on an interstate exit ramp near downtown
Friday morning, hit a wall and exploded, authorities said. An eighth
person, the driver of an 18-wheel truck, was killed after plowing
into a traffic jam caused by the wreck.
   Ten other people were injured, including James M. Malone, 57, who
was burned in another home and was listed in critical condition
today at the Regional Medical Center.
   The huge fireball destroyed six cars and damaged half a dozen
houses in addition to the duplex crushed by the tanker truck,
officials said.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board in
Washington were to inspect the scene today, said agency spokesman
Michael Benson.
   The truck crashed on Interstate 240, rupturing its tank and
releasing liquid propane that turned into a gaseous cloud as it
escaped. A spark apparently triggered the explosion, authorities
said.
   ``All of a sudden everything was on fire,'' said Dorothy
Hettinger, who lives next door to the wood-frame duplex. ``It was
like an earthquake. My whole house was shaking.''
   ``The whole sky was white, just lit up,'' said Gaines Tennison,
manager of a nearby sheet metal plant. ``You could feel the heat
inside the building.''
   The victims had little chance to escape the flames, said Frank
Baker, a deputy fire chief at the scene.
   ``There was a huge fireball, maybe 700 to 800 feet,'' Baker said.
``It engulfed three or four cars.''
   ``I heard the explosion and saw the tanker flying through the
air. It fell on the house and just blew up,'' said witness Marvin
Mitchell.
   ``It was like an unguided missile,'' said John Stonecipher, a
city fire marshal.
   Witnesses said the tanker skidded on the 25-mph ramp, according
to fire Capt. Benny McDow. The surface of the heavily used ramp onto
Interstate 40 was dry.
   ``He was trying to exit and lost control and hit a retaining
wall,'' McDow said. ``That exit there is short. It's one of those
tight turns.''
   The tanker remained mostly intact, but one end was blown out like
a spent rocket. The burned-out hulks of cars were left scattered
along I-240 and blackened a quarter-mile of grassy shoulder. A
fender from the truck wound up in a tree, and a truck axle with four
wheels attached ended up in the kitchen of James Edgeston's house
two doors from the destroyed duplex.
   ``I didn't know the wheels were in there until I got back from
the hospital,'' said Edgeston, who suffered a cut head but was not
seriously hurt.
   Some of the dead were so badly burned they had to be identified
through dental records, Stonecipher said.
   The dead included Shelanda Towles, a 10-year-old girl in one
apartment in the duplex, and Iva J. Rubesheim, 87, who lived in
another apartment, police said.
   Police Lt. James Krepela identified the other dead as the
tanker's driver, Randall Benson, 29, of West Memphis, Ark.; drivers
Harrison G. Lee, 34, of Brighton; Robert Wardlow, 40, of Memphis;
Tina Wiles, 30, and her passenger, mother-in-law Warner Wiles, 70,
both of Vicksburg, Miss.
   The accident left traffic backed up miles north and south of
Memphis. Trucker David Bailey, 29, of West Helena, Ark., was killed
when his tractor-trailer slammed into the rear of a car tied up in a
traffic jam on I-240, said Patrolman Jim Greenland.
   Eleven people were taken to hospitals, officials said. Six were
admitted, including the elderly woman who died later, and five were
treated at emergency rooms and released.

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's bid to reform the
tax system today cleared its last hurdle when the upper house of
parliament passed the measures after 24 hours of delaying tactics by
opposition parties.
   The new laws give Japan a 3 percent sales tax and reduce its
heavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upper-level
income taxes. The legislation is to take effect April 1.
   Opposition parties introduced censure motions against Takeshita
and four other government officials Friday afternoon and then
shuffled to the podium at a snail's pace to delay voting.
   The tactics carried parliament through its first overnight
session in 13 years. Opposition parties have blocked previous
attempts by other premiers to overhaul the tax system, which was
drafted by U.S. occupation authorities in the lean years after
Japan's defeat in World War II.
   Voting on the tax bills took place more than 24 hours after the
censure motions were introduced. Legislators from the Japan
Socialist and Japan Communist parties left the chamber in a show of
protest, and the bills were quickly approved by the majority Liberal
Democrats.
   Since the Takeshita administration formally submitted the tax
reform package to Parliament in July, opposition legislators led by
the Japan Socialist Party and Japan Communist Party have boycotted
sessions, demanding the government first fully investigate a
high-level stock-trading scandal.
   The scandal, involving Takeshita and other top officials who
profited from questionable sales of unlisted stocks bought at
bargain prices, has led to the resignations of politicians, business
leaders and media executives, including Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, who stepped down on Dec. 9.
   Takeshita took over the finance portfolio then.
   Tatsuo Murayama was one of the chief architects of the tax reform
package.
   A former Finance Ministry bureaucrat, he is a considered a tax
specialist and played a leading role in the Liberal Democratic
Party's tax review committee, which he has chaired since 1985.
   The Communist Party and local business groups on Friday protested
the sales tax at a rally in Takeshita's hometown.
   About 100 people shouting ``Destroy the tax bill'' and calling
for the resignation of the Cabinet marched near the Takeshita
family's sake brewery in Kakeai-cho in western Shimane prefecture,
organizer Jiro Wada said.
   A study by the Shimouma Consumers' Cooperative Association, a
Tokyo consumers' group, says that under the new tax plan, a typical
four-member household with an annual income of $53,225 will pay
$1,305 less in income and residents' taxes, but the new sales tax
will cost it an additional $500.

   Americans who lost loved ones on Pan
Am flight 103 visited the disaster site today, and police questioned
whether more than 100 bodies still missing will ever be found.
   American Joe Horgan said he had been out across the search area
near this Scottish village this morning.
   ``I think you feel better once you actually see the site for
yourself,'' said Horgan, who spoke at a news conference on condition
that his hometown and details about his relative aboard the flight
were not disclosed.
   He said he came to Lockerbie ``first and foremost to assist in
the identification process of the bodies, and for our personal need
to be near our loved one.''
   As more than 600 police, troops and rescue workers combed
Lockerbie and a wide area of the surrounding countryside for the
third day today, police said there would be no halt for Christmas.
   ``Nothing will change over Christmas,'' said police spokesman
Angus Kennedy. ``The search will go on and on. There are no plans at
all to scale down the search operation.''
   But it was uncertain whether the missing bodies would be found.
   ``We will not be able to answer that question for many days,''
Kennedy said Friday night after the second full day of searching.
   Bodies of 155 people, killed Wednesday when a Pan Am Boeing 747
slammed into the village of Lockerbie, have been placed in two
temporary mortuaries.
   But the approximately 20 relatives who have arrived in Lockerbie
have been unable to see any of the bodies because none has been
positively identified.
   Horgan said experts were ``using comparative information from
bodies they have found'' to try to identify them.
   ``Any little piece of information, whether it be clothing,
articles, anything at all, would definitely help the process come to
a speedy conclusion,'' Horgan said.
   Asked about the mental state of the relatives who flew to Britain
from the United States, he said: ``You run quite a gamut of emotions
_ grief, loss, frustration, anger.'' The anger, he said, was related
to conjectures about the cause of the disaster.
   Tom McMenamay, the local director of social work, said that
increasing numbers of relatives were arriving in Lockerbie without
advance notice.
   As soon as relatives made contact with local authorities, he
said, they were provided with a counselor. ``Everybody's been
wonderful,'' Horgan said. ``Everybody's doing a great job.''
   Pan Am says 258 people were aboard the flight to New York, and
police are looking for about 20 people on the ground who have been
missing since the crash. Six hundred people are participating in the
search, backed by helicopters and dogs trained to seek bodies.
   Heavy equipment was brought in to help move large pieces of
wreckage.
   One body was found Friday where the wreckage carved a
20-foot-deep furrow into sticky red clay and obliterated four houses.
   The explosion, which witnesses said created a 300-foot fireball,
turned much of the 747 into shrapnel that tore holes in roofs and
windows more than 100 yards away.
   Bits of debris were strewn across the devastated Sherwood
Crescent street. A chunk 10 feet long was knifed into a lawn, but
most other pieces were much smaller.
   ``On the other end in the countryside, part of the area being
searched is very difficult bogland _ so you have natural
difficulties and disaster-made difficulties,'' Kennedy said.
   The main search area extends 15 miles east of Lockerbie in the
rolling countryside of southwestern Scotland.
   Police reduced their list of missing villagers from 22 to 20. One
person whose car was caught in the inferno had been treated for
injuries and released Wednesday night, and the other was found to be
already on the list of missing.
   ``First, you search for the living, then you are searching for
the dead, then for property, evidence, bits of airplane. These
searches will go on and on and on,'' Kennedy said.
   He said as many as 30 relatives of the victims had visited
Lockerbie and had been briefed by police. He offered no details
about the visits.
   Police were not discouraging relatives from coming, Kennedy said,
but he added: ``As a police officer and a person, I would say
Lockerbie and the site of the terrible tragedy is perhaps not the
place you should be visiting at this point _ and I say that on
humanitarian grounds.''

<HEAD>Streets Empty In The Biblical City Of Bethlehem</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with annual procession, details. No

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The streets of Bethlehem
were nearly deserted today as hundreds of Israeli soldiers set up
checkpoints to prevent Christmas violence.
   As Christmas eve began in the biblical town, the bishop of
Jerusalem entered the Church of the Nativity, which marks the site
where the Bible says Jesus was born, amid the smoke of incense and a
crowd of Israeli security men.
   The bishop, Michel Sabbah, was greeted in rain-drenched Manger
Square by the Israeli military governor of Bethlehem, Lt. Col.
Shaltiel Lavy, and the city's Palestinian mayor, Elias Freij.
   Christian pilgrims seemed to be outnumbered by hundreds of
Israeli police and troops and dozens of journalists as Sabbah was
greeted under a tradition that goes back to when the region was
governed by British and Turkish rulers.
   Sabbah, the Roman Catholic patriarch, was led into the church in
a procession headed by the traditional Moslem guides in red fezzes
banging large canes on the ancient stones outside the church.
   Holy water was sprinkeld at the door of the church as Sabbah
entered, surrounded by other church officials and altar boys.
   Israeli police formed a path holding hands to keep back
journalists and others trying to get a glimpse of Sabbah in his red
robe.
   Freij said that despite the sparse number of tourists during the
day he expected that St. Catherine's Church, next to the Church of
the Nativity and where midnight Mass will be said, would be full of
pilgrims by evening.
   Asked about his message to the world on Christmas eve, Freij said:
   ``We say to God on the highest, peace on earth. My message is
that we want peace with our Israeli neighbors so both Arabs and Jews
can live in peace and security as good friends, as free people, as
equal people.''
   Only one coffee stand was open in Manger Square. The other
restaurants and tourist shops closed because of a strike declared by
the PLO-backed leaders of the year-old uprising against Israel's
occupation.
   Security was tight around Manger Square. Anyone wanting to enter
had to pass through metal detectors and be searched by Israeli
security men.
   The Rev. Stephen Doyle, a Franciscan priest from a nearby
ecumenical research center, said he thought the security might
discourage Palestinian Christians from attending midnight Mass. Many
Arab Christians have said they will not attend Mass because of the
strike.
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have asked Christian Arabs to
boycott Mass to show their solidarity with the more than 330 people
who have been killed during the rebellion. Fourteen Israelis also
have been slain.
   ``We will punish everybody who leaves his house,'' said a slogan
painted in red on one town wall. ``Let's make this day a mourning
day for our martyrs'' said another, which was signed by the pro-PLO
underground leadership.
   Freij and other city officials decided to cancel a traditional
parade by Boy Scouts during the evening ceremonies in sympathy with
the uprising.
   ``This is Christmas, but there will be no celebration or
decorations and the Christmas trees will not be put up,'' Freij said
on Israel radio.
   ``The whole mood of the West Bank is one of anger, sorrow,
frustration and anxiety,'' he said.
   Doyle was asked if he thought the cancellation of festivities was
a good idea on Christmas eve.
   ``I think they are right on target,'' said the Philadelphia-born
priest. ``There is a memory to celebrate, but the present reality is
very depressing.''
   Jean Holladay, a visitor from Wheelock, Vt., said she thought the
heavy media and security presence interfered with the holiday spirit.
   ``I think the situation here has a numbing effect on Christmas,''
she said. ``All I see now are TV people and soldiers.''
   In Nablus, 25 miles north of Bethlehem, a 21-year-old Arab man
who was shot in the head by soldiers during a demonstration last
week died of his wounds.
   A 55-year-old man from the nearby village of Ijah was shot in the
left leg during a demonstration today.
   In the Gaza Strip, stores were shut and the army closed three
schools after students set up rock barricades in the street and
pelted soldiers with stones.
   A 15-year-old boy from Gaza's Jebaliya refugee camp was shot in
the right leg after a clash with troops. He was taken to Ahli Arab
hospital and discharged after the bullet was removed.

<TEXT>
   The southern province of Guangdong has held
communist China's first civil service examination, and 11,000 of the
120,000 applicants were selected for government employment, a report
said today.
   The examination in September was reminiscent of the system used
in imperial China, where civil servants also were selected through
tests.
   In present-day China, however, the functions of Communist Party
and government officials often overlap, and political connections
frequently play a role in obtaining jobs and promotions.
   Last year, Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang proposed a civil
service system, suggesting government employees not engaged in
political work should obtain jobs on the basis of an examination,
and wages and promotions should depend on merit.
   ``The idea of giving priority to seniority and other worn-out
concepts that stifle people's initiative and creativity should be
eradicated,'' he said.
   The Guangdong examination was ``a prelude to the civil service
system,'' said the independent Ming Pao newspaper, quoting the
pro-government China News Service.
   The examination was adminstered to 120,000 people in an ``open,
fair and competitive'' manner, the report said.
   About 11,000 applicants passed the examination, including
workers, high school and university graduates, and 3,000 people from
rural areas, the report said. It did not give a breakdown of
participants by age or sex.
   The new employees will work in provincial departments, including
security, courts, finance and revenue, the report said.

   Armed men landed a helicopter in the
central yard of a Colombian prison, fired at guards and flew away
with at least five inmates connected to cocaine gangs, police said
today.
   Leonel Cruz Chaparro, warden at the Bellavista prison, said the
raid occurred Friday as about 600 inmates and their families were
celebrating Christmas in the prison yard.
   The pilot, identified as Nestor Morales, was injured and arrested
minutes later as he landed alone at the Olaya Herrera airport in
this city 170 miles northwest of Bogota.
   Police launched a manhunt for the fugitives, who were apparently
dropped off somewhere between the prison and the airport, officials
said.
   Nobody was injured on the ground, Cruz Chaparro said.
   Police said the helicopter, stolen from the private company
Helicol, landed at the yard, picked up at least five inmates and
flew away.
   The fugitives included two members of the Los Nachos gang, a
Colombian group that has been linked to killings ordered by the
Medellin cartel, which is believed responsible for most of the
cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Commandos twice have tried to raid the Bellavista prison this
year in attempts to free prisoners. Prison guards thwarted both
attacks.

   An oil tanker with 34 men aboard broke
its mooring and drifted for five hours in the stormy North Sea today
before two tugboats chased it down and began towing it back to
Scotland.
   The tugboats attached lines to the tanker about 200 miles east of
the port of Dundee, a coast guard spokesman in Aberdeen said.
   The tanker's engines were removed when it was permanently moored
in the North Sea as a storage facility where smaller tankers picked
up oil, so it drifted in strong winds and turbulent seas.
   The vessel was moored at a loading point in the Fulmar oil field
when it broke from its mooring about 5:30 a.m. in 15-foot waves and
60 mph winds and began drifting to the southeast, said the
spokesman, who demanded anonymity.

   Tornadoes swept across a section of
central Tennessee early today, killing at least one person, injuring
15 others and destroying several homes, authorities said.
   A tornado watch was posted for middle Tennessee.
   ``There's been at least eight touchdowns, numerous homes have
been destroyed and I've just been told that an apartment complex was
possibly involved,'' said David King of the Tennessee Emergency
Management Agency.
   Williamson County Sheriff's dispatcher Sharon Lambert said the
line of storms ``killed one so far we know.'' The identity of the
victim and other details of the death were not being released, she
said.
   The injured were taken to Williamson County Medical Center, south
of Nashville, some suffering minor cuts and bruises and others
serious injuries, said Tracy Fuston, nursing supervisor.
   ``Things are a little still a little crazy out here,'' she said.
``We're trying to determine the extent of the injuries.''
   The tornadoes, which struck just after 6 a.m., also ``did a lot
of property damage,'' Lambert said.
   About 16 homes were damaged in Franklin, Brentwood and the area
of Moores Lane, King said.
   Elizabeth Maranise of Franklin got a look at the debris from the
tornado as she drove from her home on Interstate 65 to work in
Nashville about half an hour after the tornado touched down.
   ``There was a car in the median,'' she said. ``Then there was
debris on both sides of the expressway just past the Moores Lane
exit _ pieces of metal and I don't know what all there was.''
   A tornado watch, which tells residents to keep an eye out for
twisters, was in effect until noon for much of western and central
Tennessee and adjacent sections of northern Mississippi.

<TEXT>
   An uprising by inmates who were denied
Christmas pardons was crushed by police, but 22 people, including
the prison warden, died in gunfights between authorities and
prisoners, officials said today.
   The incident began Thursday at the Venustiano Carranza
penitentiary in Nayarit state, when about six inmates took 12 to 14
prison employees hostage. It ended about 11 p.m. Friday when two
commando teams stormed the prison.
   ``The total counted this morning is 22 dead and five or maybe six
people seriously injured. Four, including the penitentiary director,
were killed before special forces stormed the place. Eighteen were
killed when the commandos stormed the place,'' a police officer who
demanded anonymity.
   He didn't break the death toll down into prisoners and employees.
   Another officer, Sergio Anzaldo, said: ``There was a fierce
gunfight lasting about 15 minutes before the special forces could
quell the mutiny.''
   Anzaldo, who was the duty officer when the commandos attacked,
said everything was quiet in the penitentiary today. ``The guard has
been doubled and reinforced with special elements,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   The chain of events in Tepic, 500 miles northwest of Mexico City,
began when about six inmates who had sought appointments with the
warden arrived at his prison office Thursday, said Francisco Flores,
a state government spokesman. At the same time, two well-dressed
visitors posing as lawyers approached the building, according to the
spokesman.
   The men posing as attorneys entered the prison without being
searched, then took out guns, Flores said. It was not immediately
clear who started the shooting, which Flores said ended in three
deaths.
   The dead included warden Samuel Alvarado, 31, who bled to death
from a leg wound, a security guard, and an inmate _ the brother of
the apparent leader of the assault _ officials said.
   The prisoners, angry that they were denied Christmas pardons for
good behavior, seized hostages, and Flores said about 200 soldiers,
police and guards surrounded the penitentiary.
   As dusk fell Friday, Mexico City's Zorro and Escorpion commando
teams sprayed tear gas and rushed the prison, causing what Flores
called a ``very violent confrontation.'' The ensuing violence more
people dead, including the head of the Zorro commando team, he said.
   Three hours later, the commandos staged a second raid, which
killed more people and ended up freeing the hostages, he said.
   On Friday the prisoners demanded an armored car and high-powered
firearms with the apparent intention of leaving the place, then
canceled the demand.
   Except for the few inmates holding hostages in the administrative
offices, the rest of the prison's 1,200 inmates remained under
control, Flores said. He said the mutinous prisoners included people
serving time on drug charges.
   Flores said the state attorney general, Rodolfo Leon, tried to
talk the mutineers _ who had guns, knives and clubs _ out of further
violence. He said the inmates appeared to be uncertain of what they
wanted to do.

   Susan and Shaun McMillin thought the loss of a

good Samaritan returned the purse and all the money.
   And the woman who found the purse in the street near the
McMillins' home refused to give her name or to accept a reward.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Mrs. McMillin said. ``She brought my
purse back to me and every cent was in there. She even apologized
for going through my purse to find some identification.''
   The woman told Mrs. McMillin she was running errands and saw the
purse wide open on the ground with several dollar bills sticking out.
   ``Christmas would have been ruined,'' said Mrs. McMillin, who had
lost the purse while taking money from her husband's business to a
bank. ``My husband was already talking about taking back my
presents.''

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, considered a stodgy
technocrat, has suddenly been thrust into the public eye during the
disaster caused by the Armenian earthquake.
   The Soviet Union's dynamic leader, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, has retreated into an unusual silence and been absent
from public view after making a brief trip to Armenia.
   Ryzhkov went to Armenia the morning after the Dec. 7 earthquake.
Until he returned to Moscow last week, Ryzhkov received heavy
coverage in the state-run media doing the things Soviets have come
to expect from the more voluble Gorbachev.
   Ryzhkov directed the machinery of government in full view of TV
cameras, hugged homeless Armenians and met crowds on street corners.
   Gorbachev, by contrast, rushed home from New York, spent a stormy
weekend in Armenia and has not been seen in public since Dec. 11.
   There were no indications that Ryzhkov's prominence and
Gorbachev's absence signaled any realignment in the Kremlin or that
Gorbachev was ill. But it was suddenly Ryzhkov who represented the
Kremlin throughout the burst of publicity given by the Soviet media
to the earthquake.
   The careers of Gorbachev and Ryzhkov have been linked. Ryzhkov
was appointed to the Communist Party Politburo in April 1985, a
month after Gorbachev took power. He was assigned to head the Soviet
government in September 1985, and is considered an important player
in Gorbachev's economic reform plans.
   But the earthquake _ and Gorbachev's absence _ gave the
59-year-old Ryzhkov an opportunity to shed a colorless image and
gain daily television exposure.
   ``Thank you, thank you, thank you,'' Armenians called to Ryzhkov
in the earthquake-damaged city of Kirovakan. ``People are very
satisfied,'' said an elderly woman, pressing Ryzhkov's hands.
   Ryzhkov responded to people with smiles and promises of help.
   ``He's gotten a high profile, but whether it works to his
advantage, I don't know,'' said one diplomat who spoke on condition
of anonymity. That will depend on how Ryzhkov's work in Armenia is
perceived by other Kremlin leaders, he said.
   Ryzhkov acknowledged widespread reports of disorganization in the
relief efforts during a news conference in the Armenian capital
Yerevan on Dec. 12. But he said after a bad start the organization
had begun to improve.
   In the spirit of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater
openness, Ryzhkov directly answered all the questions put to him by
foreign and Soviet reporters in Yerevan.
   He showed little emotion in his answers. But when reporters asked
him about ethnic troubles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over
control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, he began jabbing the air
with his hand and said, ``We don't understand these people. While
the whole country is helping them, they are raising these questions.
We think the Armenian people must reject them.''
   It was the same issue that caused Gorbachev to show his anger on
Soviet television. Asked about allegations by Armenian activists
that Soviet officials planned to move orphaned Armenians out of the
earthquake area and repopulate it with Russians, he responded,
``What kind of morals do those people have?''
   ``They don't need Karabakh. They are waging a battle for power,
and they must be stopped,'' Gorbachev said.
   Many Armenians are upset with Gorbachev for refusing to give in
to their demands to annex Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan.
   Gorbachev's absence from public view was ``normal for the week
after the quake, but this week it's a little more difficult to
explain,'' said the foreign diplomat.
   But Gorbachev has not missed any events that could be considered
important enough to demand his presence, and the Kremlin has
continued issuing documents over Gorbachev's name.
   The Tass news agency said Gorbachev sent a message of condolence
to President Reagan after the crash of a Pan Am jet in Scotland on
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Seen Writing Graffiti Signature, Allowing for Double
Prosecution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A graffiti artist's distinctive signature became
his downfall when police matched the one he was writing on a
Manhattan building with one that appeared on nearly 80 subway cars,
authorities said.
   Transit police saw the teen-ager writing graffiti on the building
and were able to charge him with defacing the subway cars because
the graffiti signatures, or ``tags,'' matched, said Al O'Leary, a
Transit police spokesman.
   Todd S. James, 19, was charged with second-degree criminal
mischief, first-degree criminal tampering, both felonies, and a
misdemeanor, third-degree criminal trespass, O'Leary said Friday.
   If convicted, James faces four to seven years in prison on each
felony count.
   The officers saw James spraying the letters REAS on the building,
O'Leary said. Last weekend, 160 subway cars were spraypainted,
nearly half of them with the letters REAS.
   ``This can be in the future, if the prosecution is successful, a
very valuable tool in the war against vandalism,'' O'Leary said.
``It's the first time the district attorney's office was able to
prosecute without seeing him being in the act of graffiti-ing the
property.
   ``A tag to a graffiti vandal is like a signature,'' he said.
``The way you sign your paycheck is the way a graffiti vandal writes
his or her name on public property.''

<HEAD>Arafat, PLO Leaders Meet To Plan Moves In Talks With U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leaders, faced with growing dissension
among radical factions, met Saturday to discuss forming a government
for an independent Palestinian state and map the next move in
crucial talks with the United States.
   Most of the 15 members of the PLO's governing body attended the
meeting at chief Yasser Arafat's home outside Baghdad, Palestine
Liberation Organization officials said.
   The meeting followed growing opposition by radical Palestinian
factions and some figures within the PLO to Arafat's stated
recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.
   U.S. officials insisted on such statements before they would deal
with the PLO.
   Azzam Ahmed, the PLO representative in Baghdad, said the
committee will discuss the Dec. 16 talks opened in Tunisia with the
United States and map out the future Palestinian moves in the
dialogue.
   The talks were the first direct contact between the PLO and
Washington in 13 years. If sustained, the talks could lead to a
breakthrough in the tortuous quest to end the 40-year-old
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Ahmed gave no details, but stressed the committee will explore
``all the possible ways to advance the constructive dialogue.''
   The committee also is discussing efforts for international Middle
East peace conference and the formation of a provisional government
for the independent Palestinian state declared by the PLO's
Palestine National Council last month.
   PLO officials said earlier that the provisional government might
not actually be named during the committee meeting because ``further
consultations may be needed.''
   Sixty-nine countries have recognized the still-symbolic
Palestinian state. While in Baghdad, Arafat will lay the cornerstone
of a Palestinian embassy, PLO officials said.
   Ahmed said the committee also will review the yearlong
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
and ``ways of escalating resistance to the occupation forces.'' At
least 334 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died.
   Arafat arrived in Baghdad late Friday after flying from Rome,
where he met earlier with Pope Paul II and Italian leaders.
   Ahmed indicated that the PLO might call for an Arab summit to
press for an international peace conference under U.N. auspices.
   It is not clear how extensive opposition within the executive
committee is to Arafat's moves.
   One member, Mustafa Zibri, deputy leader of the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, attacked Arafat's peace
initiative.On Monday, Zibri declared that Arafat's recognition of
Israel and renunciation of terrorism ``were only Arafat's personal
opinion and are incompatible'' with resolutions passed by the
Palestine National Council.
   He warned: ``We will continue to exercise our legitimate rights
in struggling against the occupation by all means available,
including armed struggle.''
   Palestinian dissidents based in Syria warned Tuesday they will
continue ``the armed struggle'' against Israel to torpedo his peace
moves and will seek to oust him from PLO leadership.
   The Americans have said they will break off the dialogue with the
PLO if the movement is found to have carried out terrorist attacks.
   In Lebanon, newspapers reported Saturday that the PLO and the
Shiite Moslem Amal militia have reached a new peace pact to end
their bloody 3-year conflict. The papers published the pact, the
sixth since 1985, and there was widespread doubt whether the accord
would hold.
   More than 3,000 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded since
Amal moved against Palestinian refugee camps to prevent Arafat from
rebuilding a power base in Lebanon. Israel destroyed Palestinian
outposts in a 1982 invasion.
   Newspapers said the new pact provides for a disengagement of
forces and the removal of barricades to enforce a cease-fire between
Amal and the PLO around Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon.
   Amal has an estimated 10,000 armed militiamen. The PLO has 4,500
guerrillas based in the Sidon region, 25 miles south of Beirut.

   Four Colombian men were arrested after
police made an unusual holiday haul _ a 12-figure nativity scene
filled with pressed cocaine worth $2 million.
   Police said Saturday that drug agents had discovered 6.6 pounds
of the drug inside figures including the infant Jesus, the Virgin
Mary, the three Kings and little lambs.
   The seizure and arrests capped a three-month surveillance of a
Colombian man suspected of being a major contact in drug-smuggling
operations into Madrid's Barajas Airport, police said.
   They said agents followed the man to the airport Thursday, where
they said he met a suspected drug courier arriving on a flight from
Bogota, Colombia.
   According to agents, the men went to an apartment in Madrid where
police later discovered the nativity scene along with $52,631 in
cash, which they also seized.
   Police said Luis Eduardo Fernandez Quijano, 21, and Jorge Enrique
Restrepo Jaramillo, 49, were arrested on drug-trafficking charges
along with two other men who were not identified.

<HEAD>Loose Oil Storage Vessel Drifts 13 Miles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant oil storage vessel broke its
mooring and drifted for 13 miles on Saturday, forcing a shutdown of
more than 10 percent of Britain's North Sea oil production, coast
guard and oil company officials said.
   Two tugboats sent to the scene, about 200 miles east of the
Scottish port of Dundee, managed to attach lines to the tanker and
brought the vessel under control after five hours, said the Coast
Guard Rescue and Coordination Center in Aberdeen.
   The converted 200,000-ton tanker with 34 men on board was being
towed by the tugs, the Oil Chancellor and the Oil Challenger, the
coast guard said. Its destination was not immediately known.
   The vessel is a tanker modified to act as a fixed, engineless
floating storage tank. It has been permanently moored in Shell UK's
Fulmar oilfield, collecting oil from three fields and then loading
the crude on to smaller tankers.
   Shell UK said production from the three fields _ the Fulmar and
neighboring Auk and Clyde platforms _ had been shut down
automatically when the vessel broke free.
   The three fields have a combined daily production of 210,000
barrels of crude _ 10 to 12 percent of total output from the British
sector of the North Sea, said a Shell spokesman. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Shell said production from the three fields would remain shut
because they now had nowhere to send their oil. Crude oil from the
three platforms normally flows by pipeline along the seabed and
feeds into the vessel, known as a Floating Storage Unit.
   When the vessel broke free at about 5:30 a.m. in 15-foot seas and
60-knot winds, Shell said it dragged its mooring installation with
it.
   Shell said a ``sizable'' amount of oil had been spotted in the
area, but it was not known whether a serious leak had developed.
   When the system shut down automatically at the seabed, Shell said
there were 370 cubic yards of oil in the pipeline beyond the
shutdown point.
   Initially, there were fears the vessel would collide with other
installations in the North Sea. With the vessel under tow,
helicopters called out from Scotland and northern England to
evacuate the men if necessary were recalled.

   The government is considering an
unseasonal austerity measure: a law that would prohibit the exchange
of gifts with visiting foreigners.
   President Raif Dizdarevic asked Parliament to order that no
presents be given to foreign officials on state visits, the official
news agency Tanjug said Saturday.
   The agency did not say how much Yugoslavia has spent in 1988 on
gifts for visitors such as Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The proposed law drew attention to the need for economizing in
the state budget, Tanjug said. Yugoslavia is burdened with a $21
billion foreign debt and an annual inflation rate of about 250
percent.

<TEXT>
   For the first time in recent years,
blacks are buying toys, sending Christmas cards and filling their
holiday shopping bags without fear that they will be punished for
breaking a boycott.
   But although some holiday traditions are making a comeback,
others died during the years of unrest and Yuletide protest against
apartheid.
   There is no Santa Claus in Soweto.
   ``We are the biggest store in Soweto but we do not have a Father
Christmas here. We believe that would be something out of place.
That is something that is confined to town (where whites live),''
said Paul Gama, chief executive of the Black Chain supermarket.
   Gama said last year he didn't even offer Christmas items for
sale. This year Christmas cards and inexpensive balls and small
plastic guns are selling briskly.
   ``I think the people must be paying for the lost years in terms
of enjoyment and excitement because this is the first normal
Christmas where there is no tension from any quarter,'' Gama said.
   Santa Claus once was a part of Soweto's holiday imagery, but
since nationwide anti-government unrest broke out in 1984 there have
been calls for a ``Black Christmas.''
   The calls consisted of boycotts against shopping for Christmas
presents and festive food, Christmas Eve blackouts in the townships,
and memorial services for those detained under a state of emergency.
   The township of 2.5 million blacks outside Johannesburg was a
focal point of the unrest.
   People who worked in Johannesburg and bought goods there during
the Christmas shopping period sometimes were attacked by youths when
they disembarked from buses or trains.
   Sometimes boycott-breakers were beaten or killed. In 1986, the
call went out for a Christmas Eve blackout in Soweto and monitors
patrolled the township, knocking on doors if they saw any more light
than a candle.
   There was no formal announcement that this year would be
different, and not even the outlawed African National Congress has a
definitive reason for the renewed holiday spirit.
   ``It is possible that the popular democratic movement has found
other ways and methods to register their feelings about apartheid
without making a public call for a boycott,'' said Tom Sebina, a
spokesman for the guerrilla organization, in a statement from
Lusaka, Zambia.
   People detained without charge have been a major focus of the
``Black Christmas'' protests since a national emergency was declared
in June 1986. The release of hundreds of detainees over the past few
months may have defused some of the motives for protest, although
hundreds, almost all of them black, still remain in custody without
charge.
   One of them, journalist Brian Sokutu, has been held without
charge or trial for 30 months.
   Many Soweto residents go home for Christmas, and home is usually
a homestead in a rural area. For many men and women, the long
holiday period is the only time of the year they see their children,
who are raised by grandmothers in tribal homelands because of lack
of housing and school space in the urban townships.
   In Cape Town, meanwhile, the family of jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela arrived carrying presents and a cake for a Christmas visit.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, their daughter, Zinzi, and their three
grandchildren planned an 80-minute visit Sunday with Mandela at his
suburban-style house on the grounds of the Victor Vester Prison.
   Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, was moved to
the house Dec. 7 after recuperating from tuberculosis at a Cape Town
hospital.
   Under the new terms of Mandela's confinement, his family is
allowed unlimited visits. However, Mrs. Mandela has said the family
will not accept any special privileges from the white-led government
and will make only the standard prison visits of no more than 80
minutes.
   The government's decision to place Mandela in a prison staff
house is seen as part of an effort to release the black leader in
stages.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Hanford Dole, first and perhaps the
only woman named to the Bush cabinet, has the resume of a topnotch
Ivy League lawyer and the charm of a quintessential Southern belle.
   Her ability to disarm even the toughest critics has earned her
widespread popularity on Capital Hill, even among many Democrats.
And her reputation as an able government official appears to have
weathered harsh evaluations of her Reagan administration tenure as
transportation secretary.
   ``She is a woman of great ability with many friends in both
parties on Capitol Hill,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee that must
confirm her.
   Saturday she was named as labor secretary by President-elect
Bush. The choice left just one Cabinet spot open, that of energy
secretary.
   Relentlessly cheerful, Mrs. Dole is at age 52 half of what inside
Washington likes to call a ``power couple.'' Her husband is Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole, who unsuccessfully sought his party's
presidential nomination. They have a Watergate apartment and a
miniature schnauzer named ``Leader.''
   Known as ``Liddy,'' a nickname she picked herself, Mrs. Dole was
born in Salisbury, N.C., the only daughter of John Van Hanford, a
small-town florist, and Mary Ella Hanford. Early on, she displayed a
promising combination of brains and beauty.
   Growing up, she had ballet classes, horseback riding lessons and
at 18, a debutante ball in Raleigh. At 20, she was student body
president of the Women's College at Duke University and also May
Queen. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree in
history from Duke in 1958 and went on to receive a master's degree
in education and government from Harvard University in 1960.
   In 1962 she was named beauty queen at a Boston naval base,
although she later recalled: ``I was getting a little old for this
sort of thing.'' She graduated from Harvard Law School in 1965.
   Washington, her mother said, drew Mrs. Dole ``like a magnet.''
She immersed herself for 20 years in the process of climbing the
political ladder. In the process, she switched from Democrat to
Independent to Republican.
   She made her way through the old Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, the Federal Trade Commission and President Nixon's
Commission on Consumer Interests. In 1976 she took a leave of
absence from the FTC to campaign for her husband's vice presidential
bid and in 1979, she quit the FTC two years before her term expired
to help him run for president.
   Mrs. Dole is generally credited with softening her husband's
hatchet-man image, although she dismisses that, seeming to suggest
he was always really a softy: ``He's sort of the way I always knew
him.''
   With no prior background in the transportation field, Mrs. Dole
was named in 1983 as President Reagan's transportation secretary.
She pushed for mandatory seat belt laws, tighter screening
procedures in airports and more sophisticated anti-collision devices
for airliners.
   But she was criticized in Congress for spending more time on
press releases than real improvements. Critics contended she more
often than not unveiled new regulatory procedures after the
department had been pushed into it by Congress or the courts.
Critics also faulted her for approving a string of airline mergers
that concentrated much of the airline industry into a half-dozen
large carriers.
   In 1987, a trade journal called her DOT stewardship ``little more
than a planned media event.'' And The Washington Monthly headlined a
cover story: ``Charming Her Way to the White House; air travel
stinks, auto safety's a joke and Washington still loves Liddy Dole.''
   Mrs. Dole stepped down a year ago to help her husband's
presidential campaign, saying the move had nothing to do with the
criticism and declaring she was glad to join him on the campaign
trail after years of living ``like passing ships in the night.''
   Sen. Dole noted her new appointment with a combination of pride
and humor. ``It looks like TV dinners for me again, but I'll still
probably vote for her confirmation,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan refugees are arriving in South Florida at
a pace reminiscent of the Mariel sealift in 1980, when 125,000
Cubans hit the shores over a five-month period.
   The scene in 1980: Some 700 Mariel Cubans were temporarily housed
at the Orange Bowl before being moved to a ``tent city'' underneath
an Interstate 95 overpass. At one point, as many as 1,200 Cubans
crowded into 40 tents.
   Now Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, the spring home of the Baltimore
Orioles, has become the winter home of Nicaraguans who fled their
war-torn Central American nation in hopes of a better life.
   Late this week, 275 Nicaraguans were housed at the stadium, with
more arriving daily, many coming across from Mexico and traveling
east.
   Conny Duarte, secretary of the Committee of Poor Nicaraguans in
Exile, which is helping city workers run the shelter, estimated that
number could nearly double by the end of the month.
   ``We are strapped to the max,'' said Bobby Bernal, administrative
assistant to Dade County's manager and refugee coordinator.
``Immigration is a federal responsibility. But we can't turn our
backs.''
   About 70 percent of the 200 asylum applications received daily at
the Miami office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service are
from Nicaraguans, said INS district director Perry Rivkind. Some
35,000 to 40,000 Nicaraguans have applied here for asylum over the
past year, he said.
   The flood can be attributed to the collapse of the economy as
well as the foundering rebel movement against the Sandinistas.
   While the total has been spread out over a longer period, the
impact of the refugees has been compared to the exodus of Cubans
from the port of Mariel in the 1980 ``Freedom Flotilla.''
   ``It's going to come to a point when we'll look at the federal
government and say, `When is it going to end? When can we see a
slowdown in this problem?''' Bernal said. ``If the government
doesn't wish to curtail this, then provide us with some dollars.''
   Prompted by a backlog of asylum applications in Miami, Los
Angeles and Harlingen, Texas, INS plans to beef up review teams to
process petitions, and it has been announced that Nicaraguans will
no longer automatically receive authorization to work while their
cases are pending.
   But the refugees at the stadium were lucky. They are expected to
receive work permits within days, following a meeting between Miami
City Manager Cesar Odio and INS Commissioner Alan Nelson in
Washington.
   Working papers. There's little else the refugees talk about in
the bowels of the stadium, where they were moved recently from a
three-room storefront in Little Havana.
   ``We have everything here _ food and clothes _ but we want to
have a home and be able to work,'' said Ana Maria Zepeda, who is
seven months pregnant and came with her husband and three children,
ages 2 to 5. ``We all say it would be the best Christmas if we could
get work permits.''
   The women and children are separated from the men, who sleep on
the second floor in a space beneath the stadium's bleachers. The
women are in a first-floor shower-locker room area that is lined
wall-to-wall with cots and metal bunk beds piled high with blankets
and clothes. The children play down the center aisle with donated
toys. A fake, undecorated Christmas tree and a television are on a
corner table.
   Donated food and clothing also has been evenly split with a
varying number of Miami's homeless population, who are staying in
another part of the stadium.
   But while the goods have poured in and volunteers are abundant,
housing for the refugees remains a critical issue. Already, the
refugee population has outgrown an empty city-owned building being
renovated as a shelter. The stadium must be emptied by mid-January,
and the new shelter can only accommodate 150 people, Ms. Garcia said.
   Other alternatives being discussed include setting up a trailer
park on three acres of state-owned land in west Dade.
   Despite the problems, Mayor Xavier Suarez says he hasn't become
overly worried about the city's ability to absorb the latest wave of
refugees.
   ``We're obviously rolling with the punches here,'' he said.
``This is a pretty resilient community.''

<HEAD>Special Education Costs $3,555 Extra Per Child</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools spent an extra $3,555 for each of the
4.4 million handicapped children receiving some form of special
education in the 1985-86 academic year, according to a study
prepared for the government.
   The total cost for special education students was $6,335 on
average, or 2.3 times the $2,780 cost for regular classwork, the
report said. About 11 percent of the nation's school children
receive special education in some way.
   The new $1.8 million study, done by a private research and
analysis firm, Decision Resources Corp., breaks down the special
education costs by the different approaches used to teach children
with handicaps, ranging from physical disabilities to mental
disorders.
   It examined both ``resource programs,'' or those serving pupils
for less than half of the regular 30-hour school week, and
``self-contained programs'' _ defined as those which occupied more
than 15 hours per week.
   Looking only at what was spent on special education, the resource
programs spent $2,463 per pupil versus $5,566 per pupil in the
self-contained programs.
   But the schools also incurred regular education costs for these
pupils _ the full regular cost of $2,780 for those in resource
programs, and about half as much, $1,347, for those in
self-contained programs.
   That boosted the total per pupil costs to $5,243 for those in
resource programs and to $6,913 for those in self-contained
programs, the study said.
   ``It's an erroneous comparison to say, `If I had all the kids in
resource programs, I could save a lot of money,''' said Mary Moore,
vice president of Decision Resources Corp. and project director for
the study. ``The difference is only about $1,700, not $3,000.''
   The study, based on visits to 60 school districts in 18 states,
also found average per pupil costs of:
   _$4,750 for preschool special education programs, plus $973 in
regular education costs for a total of $5,723.
   _$29,108 for residential programs, plus $389 in regular education
costs for a total of $29,497.
   Most special education pupils were enrolled in resource programs,
and they spent 80 percent of their time in regular education.
   Fifteen percent of those in self-contained programs spent no time
in regular education. The rest spent an average of 28 percent of
their time in regular classes.
   The study said special education costs rose 10 percent after
inflation between 1977-78 and 1985-86, versus a 4 percent increase
for regular education.
   Instruction accounted for 63 percent of the special education
costs, assessment 13 percent, support services 11 percent, related
services 10 percent and transportation 5 percent. Moore said the
percentages added to more than 100 percent because of rounding up.
   The average caseload for teachers in resource programs was 26
students.
   In self-contained programs, there was one teacher for every four
hard-of-hearing students; one per five autistic or multihandicapped
students; one per seven deaf or visually handicapped students; one
per eight mentally retarded or orthopedically impaired students; one
per nine speech impaired or seriously emotionally disturbed
students, and one per 13 learning disabled students.
   Transportation was the most expensive related service provided
handicapped students. Thirty percent needed special transportation
services, at an average cost of $1,583. Assessment cost an average
of $1,206, physical therapy $993, occupational therapy $918,
psychological services $867, speech language pathology $648 and
guidance and counseling $553.
   Federal dollars provided 5 percent of the local district's
instructional budget for the handicapped, but 17 percent of their
budget for support services.
   Moore discussed the report in an interview and provided a set of
tables prepared for a recent briefing for special education groups.
The full report, ``Patterns in Special Education _ Service, Delivery
and Cost,'' will be available early next year.

   They call her the Lizard Lady. She can tell at a
glance if a handbag is cobra or crocodile, python or plastic. Nor is
she cowed by rawhide vs. Naugahyde, boa vs. bogus.
   As the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inspector at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport, Carol Carson supervises the shipment
of wild animals, checks fish bound for restaurants, sees that
leather goods are properly imported and makes sure that endangered
species or items made from them are not allowed into the country.
   If an item comes from an endangered species, such as the
hawksbill turtle or white leopard, she doesn't monkey around. The
item is confiscated, and the worst offenders can receive up to a
year in prison and a $20,000 fine.
   Some travelers who have their souvenirs taken away submit
quietly. Others have ``made me glad I had a customs inspector
standing next to me and that he was armed,'' Ms. Carson said.
   She rides herd on hunting trophies from an African safari being
shipped to a taxidermist in Birmingham, Ala., rare monkeys being
exchanged by zoos for breeding, and European salmon headed for some
of the Southeast's finest restaurants.
   For her territory _ the Southeast with the exception of Miami _
Ms. Carson inspects products ranging from Italy's smartest leather
clothing and accessories to ``cheap junk, tanned so badly it will
start to smell in a few weeks.''
   A big day was the interception of 100 illegal elephant tusks.
This day's haul, though, included cheap items sent from Nigeria to
an address in the Atlanta suburb of College Park.
   Seated on plastic trash bags spread on the floor of the KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines freight terminal, Ms. Carson cataloged and counted a
growing pile of purses, wallets and briefcases made of various
reptile hides.
   A glance told her whether it was cobra or monitor lizard. Some,
however, weren't that easy. Her fingers probed the trim on a
drawstring purse.
   ``It's fake,'' she finally said, grinning. ``It's trimmed in fake
alligator.'' Fake is legal.
   But she confiscated 239 items that didn't have proper permits or
were made from monitor lizards, whose skins cannot be brought into
the United States under the Endangered Species Act.
   The rest of the shipment was either cowhide items or African
garments colored with cheap vegetable dye. The clothing was possibly
illegal because of import quotas for textiles, but that was a matter
for the Customs Service.
   Buried in a second shipment of cloth items and bags of shredded
grass were two 12-foot python hides, two cobra skins, two antelope
hides, five snakeskin handbags, three pairs of lizard shoes and the
skin of a civet, a cat-like creature.
   The bags of confiscated goods made a pile in the back of the van
with a ``Lizard Lady'' plate on the front.
   ``The international mechanics at Delta tagged me with that name
when I first got here,'' Ms. Carson said.
   A college wildlife major and onetime zoo volunteer, Ms. Carson
joined the Fish and Wildlife Service as a secretary. When the
service decided to put an inspector at Hartsfield four years ago,
``I was the only one around with a biology background who wanted
it.''
   ``I like the (Lizard Lady) designation now,'' she said. ``It
keeps me high profile. Customs, the Agriculture Department, the
airlines, they know who I am, that I am here. I'm sure I'm listed in
some Rolodexes as Lizard Lady.''

   The women at the birthday party enjoyed
watching a male stripper shuck his fake sheriff's deputy outfit, but
police gave him a different reception on his way home.
   Charles Bateham, 27, was charged with impersonating a police
officer. The charges were later dropped, but Bateham suffered a
separated shoulder in a motorcycle accident prior to his arrest.
   The stripper started off his act Oct. 16 wearing a fake sheriff's
deputy uniform with ``Sarasota Sheriff's Office'' patches on the
arms, a mail-order ``County Mounty'' badge and a gun belt.
   After performing at the birthday party, Bateham said he put a
jacket over his uniform and was driving toward his girlfriend's
house when a police car started following him. He had an accident on
a dead end road.
   ``When (the officers) walked up to me, I told them I was a dancer
and it was a BB gun. One reached over and threw the gun on the
ground, and the rest is history.''
   When he arrived in court Thursday to stand trial, he learned the
misdemeanor charge was being dropped.
   Defense attorney Ty Trayner said a person cannot be convicted of
impersonating a police officer just because he is dressed for the
part. He has to try something official, like threaten to arrest
somebody.
   So Bateham is free to continue using the uniform with Male
Express.
   ``The deputy uniform is our most popular outfit,'' he said.
``I'll just take more precautions from now on. I won't wear the
shirt or gun belt when I'm traveling.''

   Soviet holiday customs look a lot like American
ones, but in Moscow, the jolly man with the fluffy white beard and
red suit rides in a taxi and few of the presents he brings run on
batteries.
   Instead of standing in line at a shopping mall to sit on Santa's
lap, many Soviet children get house calls from Ded Moroz _
Grandfather Frost _ and Snegurochka, a beautiful snow maiden dressed
in white.
   Five-year-old Olga's eyes lit up as Ded Moroz and Snegurochka
walked into her family's apartment Saturday morning.
   The couple sang, danced and told riddles with the little girl.
Ded Moroz then opened his sack and pulled out a huge teddy bear,
which Olga's father had handed him secretly beforehand.
   ``It's so beautiful,'' said Olga, who was dressed in a
powder-blue princess costume and wore a shiny tiara and a big light
blue bow atop her head.
   Ded Moroz and Snegurochka wished the family happy New Year and
trudged through the mounds of snow back to their hired yellow taxi.
They had about 30 more stops before the day was through.
   ``I don't feel like it's New Year's unless I dress up like this
and visit little children,'' said Vladimir Krylov, 37, who has been
playing Ded Moroz for nine years.
   ``Our (Soviet) children believe so much that Ded Moroz and
Snegurochka are real,'' said Lyuda Golubgikova, 33, a six-year
veteran Snegurochka. ``I love to see their eyes shine when we walk
in.''
   After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, the primary winter
holiday in the Soviet Union switched from Christmas, celebrated Jan.
7 in the Russian Orthodox faith, to New Year's.
   Olga's parents were among about 4,000 people who each paid a
Moscow business called Consumer Services about $9 to have the
holiday couple bring New Year's greetings to their children between
Dec. 24 and Jan. 5, said Tamara Korovina, who hired the cast of
characters.
   People signed up for Ded Moroz house calls at Detsky Mir, the
largest children's store in the Soviet Union, located in the center
of Moscow.
   Soviets flock to Detsky Mir from across the nation and buy about
500,000 toys per day during the holiday season, said Garnik
Oganesyan, director of commerce at the five-story store.
   Valentina Rubin, 31, went to Detsky Mir to pick up a toy for her
3-year-old son, but while shopping decided to order a visit from Ded
Moroz.
   ``Andrusha will be so surprised! He has only seen Ded Moroz on
greeting cards,'' she said.
   Mrs. Rubin said she had no trouble finding the toy submarine her
son had requested. All she had to do was fight the crowd at Detsky
Mir _ which makes Christmas Eve at a New York department store look
calm in comparison _ and wait in line for 30 minutes.
   Parents whose children asked for electronic or battery-operated
toys were likely to be disappointed. Detsky Mir only had a few such
toys, and as soon as they went on display they were snapped up,
admitted Oganesyan.
   ``My 11-year-old son wants an electronic game, but I don't think
I'll be able to find it,'' said a Detsky Mir employee, who asked
that her name not be used.
   She said Soviet children usually receive just one toy, ``because
for each gift a parent must run, run, run to find it and then wait,
wait, wait to buy it.''

``He would call me up and say, `How're you doing, Mom? I was
thinking about you today.' He did that just last week and said he
was looking forward to coming home,'' she said.

<HEAD>Japan Approves Tax Reform Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI TAKETA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita won a major victory
Saturday when parliament's upper house voted his controversial tax
reform package into law, paving the way for the first overhaul of
Japan's postwar tax system.
   Takeshita's Liberal Democratic Party used its commanding
parliamentary majority to pass the package, which introduces a 3
percent sales tax and cuts corporate and upper-level income taxes.
   Strong public and political opposition stopped several previous
tax reform attempts in the past 10 years.
   Takeshita, who had set tax reform as his top priority, bowed
deeply to the chamber after its approval and moved quickly to allay
fears.
   ``I am well aware ... that there are fears and anxieties among
the people about the new tax system,'' he said. ``The reform has
laid the foundation for a prosperous aging society, and for
sustaining the vitality of Japan's economy and society.''
   Takeshita vowed not to increase the sales tax above 3 percent
through the remainder of his term, which ends next fall. Opposition
parties had raised concerns that the government would raise the rate
to increase revenues.
   Takako Doi, who leads Japan's largest opposition group, called
the legislation ``defective'' and said her Japan Socialist Party
would continue to demand the resignations of the Takeshita Cabinet
and the dissolution of Parliament.
   The laws ``extend injustice and unfairness by forcing large
sacrifices in people's daily lives through heavy tax burdens,'' Doi
told a news conference.
   They cut taxes for corporations and higher wage-earners, but the
tax burden of lower-income families is expected to increase.
   The measures constitute the first major overhaul of the tax
system drafted by U.S. occupation authorities after Japan's World
War II defeat.
   Passage of the bills followed five months of deliberations that
were interrupted by frequent opposition boycotts after disclosures
that top politicians, including aides to Prime Minister Takeshita
and former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, had profited from
questionable stock dealings.
   Within minutes of the vote, Takeshita appointed a new finance
minister, Tatsuo Murayama, one of the architects of the tax reform.
Takeshita had been acting finance minister since Dec. 9, when
Miyazawa resigned after being linked to the scandal.
   Approval ratings for the Takeshita administration plummeted over
its handling of the stock scandal and tax package.
   The drop in support reflected the heavy importance the Japanese
attach to political consensus.
   ``If Takeshita is a poor prime minister, or too straightforward,
or not skilled at consensus-making, of course the bills would not
pass,'' said Seizaburo Sato, a political science professor at Tokyo
University.
   ``But the more important thing is that it took 10 years, and
there was a growing consciousness emerging of the necessity of the
sales tax,'' Sato said.
   Also Saturday, Takeshita said he would postpone until spring a
planned January trip to Washington to meet with President-elect
George Bush. Reports cited Emperor Hirohito's precarious health and
implementation of the tax plan as reasons for the delay.

   President Reagan urged Americans today to
remember those, both in their own country and in earthquake-stricken
Armenia, whose holidays are diminished by tragedy.
   ``We know that there are those among us for whom the holidays are
painful and lonely,'' Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast,
which was taped Thursday and broadcast as the president vacationed
at his new home here.
   ``I know you join with me in hoping that this year they will take
heart and have faith,'' he said.
   ``Now, here in our country, there are children without homes,
suffering from dire diseases, whose Christmases will be makeshift at
best,'' the president said.
   As he often has, he paid tribute to organizations, such as Toys
for Tots, which provide gifts and other help for such children.
   ``I know all Americans have joined with me in grieving for those
who perished in the Armenian earthquake,'' Reagan said.
   Here, too, the president praised the volunteer relief efforts
from America and other countries, including Israel and Lebanon,
which have poured into Armenia.
   Athough the tape was made after Wednesday's crash of a Pan
American jumbo jet in Scotland, the president made no mention of it.
He did make a statement of condolence about the crash as he left the
White House on Friday.
   Later in the day, he said that after nearly eight years of living
upstairs in the White House, he's awed by the 6,500-square-foot home
he and his wife, Nancy, will live in after his term ends Jan. 20.
   Reagan got his second look at the house Friday when he and the
first lady arrived here to begin a two-week California vacation.
   ``I am awed and I love it,'' assistant White House Press
Secretary Mark Weinberg quoted the president as saying after the
first lady took him on a tour of the secluded home in the ritzy Bel
Air section of town.
   Mrs. Reagan had confided to reporters earlier that she sneaked
the president out of his hotel without reporters being told during
one of their earlier visits to Los Angeles so Reagan could get a
peek at the house.
   She had him crouch down in a White House car so he couldn't be
seen, she said.
   The house stands on 1\ acres of ground, with a swimming pool. A
group of 20 California friends of the Reagans bought it in 1986 with
them in mind. The Reagans are leasing the house from the group,
called Wall Management.
   Before Reagan became president, he and his family lived in
Pacific Palisades, in the western part of Los Angeles, in a house
that has since been sold.
   They have a Spanish style adobe house of five rooms and 1,500
square feet at their ranch in the Santa Ynez mountains about 30
miles north of Santa Barbara. Reagan has said they plan to make
occasional visits to the ranch during his retirement, just as they
did while in the White House.
   The president and first lady were expected to go out to dinner
Saturday night with Charles Z. Wick, the director of the U.S.
Information Agency, and his wife. This is a Christmas eve custom
with them, but in recent years the dinner has been in Washington.
   The Reagans will have Christmas dinner at their new home Sunday
with all of their children and grandchildren except for their
estranged daughter, Patti Davis.
   They will return to Washington on Jan. 5 after seeing the new
year in at the home of publisher Walter Annenberg in Rancho Mirage,
Calif., near Palm Springs.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Urges Military Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on
Saturday urged President Roh Tae-woo to accept a North Korean call
for political and military talks on easing tension on the divided
Korean peninsula.
   Kim, who heads South Korea's largest opposition party, told
reporters that positive overtures were needed from South Korea to
end the military confrontation and expedite reunification with North
Korea.
   The leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy said substantial
progress could be made next year in talks with North Korea because
changing circumstances on the peninsula were forcing the North to
open its doors.
   North Korea has called for high-level political and military
discussions between the two Koreas that could clear the way for
summit talks on reuniting the peninsula.
   In addition, North Korea last week called for three-way talks
among North and South Korea and the United States to negotiate
durable peace measures.
   On Saturday, members of South Korea's Cabinet agreed to consider
the North's proposal for the political and military talks.
Government officials who requested anonymity said South Korea would
seek a dialogue with the North at the level of prime minister.
   The Hankook Ilbo, a leading Seoul newspaper, said contacts are
continuing through various channels to help realize Roh's desire to
hold a summit with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Il Sung.
   Both Koreas in recent months have made proposals for improving
relations, but little progress has been made. South Korean officials
have said they believe the North's recent proposals were aimed
mainly at removing U.S. troops from the South.
   North Korea contends the presence of 42,000 U.S. troops in the
South is preventing reunification of the peninsula, which was
divided in 1945 when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial
rule at the end of World War II.
   However, lawmakers from both sides are to resume talks on Dec. 29
on a possible non-aggression agreement and other peace measures.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze left North
Korea Saturday after a three-day visit during which he pledged his
country would not establish diplomatic relations with South Korea,
an official report said.
   The two countries stressed in a joint communique that a reduction
of tensions between rival Koreas was ``of enormous importance in
guaranteeing peace'' in the Asia-Pacific region, the official Korean
Central News Agency said.
   The Soviet Union expressed its support for North Korean proposals
for political and military talks between North and South Korea, and
for peace talks involving the two Koreas and the United States, said
the agency dispatch, monitored in Tokyo.
   The Soviet side also reaffirmed its opposition to recognizing
both Koreas as a means of reducing tension. It pledged it would not
establish diplomatic relations with South Korea despite its
participation in the Seoul Olympic Games and its increasing trade
ties with the South.
   The United States and Japan have called on China and the Soviet
Union, North Korea's allies, to recognize South Korea in exchange
for their establishing relations with the North. But North Korea has
said such moves will lead to the permanent division of the peninsula.

   Roy Smoot is a shopping mall Santa Claus, but
he never says ``Ho, ho, ho,'' he never flirts, and he knows what to
do if a frightened child wets on him.
   Smoot is a graduate of the ``University of Santa Claus,'' a
nationwide how-to course sponsored by Los Angeles-based Western
Temporary Services to train a select few on the finer points of
playing the jolly old elf.
   ``I never pictured myself as a Santa Claus,'' says Smoot, who
calls himself a cowboy _ a horseshoer by trade. ``It was really
overwhelming at first.''
   This is Smoot's first experience as Santa. His towering 6-foot-4,
nearly 300-pound frame helps him play the part. But he's more than
just another pretty Santa.
   Smoot, 42, finished his training several weeks ago after being
recruited by Western to serve as one of the company's Santas.
   ``We approached him. He's got that look about him, that sparkle
in his eye,'' said Darla Lowell, manager of Western's Tulsa office.
   Western's course is based on the concept that there's more to
being Santa than wearing a red suit and laughing a loud ``Ho, ho,
ho.''
   ``You can put the facade on, but it doesn't work,'' said Jenny
Zink, national director of marketing for Western in the company's
Los Angeles office.
   Western trained more than 3,300 Santas this year to appear at
shopping malls and department stores, even restaurants and bank
lobbies, across the country.
   There's really no university, but graduates of the course do
receive a diploma from Western's ``University of Santa Claus.''
   The company has more than 325 offices that specialize in finding
temporary employees for clerical, technical, legal and accounting
services. It takes its Santa business seriously.
   ``This is a very important job,'' said Ms. Zink, who heads
Western's Santa division. ``We probably wouldn't spend half a day
training a laborer to pick up a piano.''
   Santas trained by Western must pass the company's course, which
teaches them ``how to be authentic Santas,'' Ms. Lowell said.
   There's a 40-minute introduction video, instructions on what to
say to children, suggested dialogue, lessons on how to dress like
Santa, and a requirement that each Santa know the names of all the
reindeers. The course ends with a written test that prospective
Santas must pass to graduate.
   ``Only one in 23 applicants is selected for Santa,'' Ms. Lowell
said. ``We interview a lot of people, check references and verify
they are people of high character and morals.''
   Western, which has provided Santas nationwide for 21 years,
advises its Santas to follow the guidelines it provides when dealing
with children. ``We frown upon any type of originality because it
has been proven that this brings disaster,'' reads the company's
manual for the ``Santa technique.''
   Santas should address children as ``young fellow'' or ``young
lady;'' refer to parents as ``folks'' because many children are
adopted; never flirt _ Santa is married; ask children what toys they
want for Christmas so they won't ask for intangible items, such as
the reuniting of divorced parents; never make quick, jerky movements
with small children who might be frightened by something unexpected;
and if a child wets, calmly lift the child and cheerfully hand them
back to the parent.
   Perhaps the most interesting instruction involves what most
people identify with Santa. ``We omit the ``Ho, ho, ho'' because it
may frighten the children,'' the Western training manual states.
``Talk softly.''

   The Basque separatist group ETA
claimed responsibility for three bombings and a fatal shooting in
the past week, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   In a statement in the Basque daily Egin, the group said it bombed
a Civil Guard barracks Friday in the northern town of Alsasua,
seriously injuring one guard.
   The group said it planted another bomb near the Basque town of
Areta on Friday that damaged several Civil Guard vehicles and
slightly injured one guard and a bystander.
   ETA said it also was responsible for the attack Thursday in the
northern town of Zarauz in which a gunman killed a bar owner.
   The group also claimed the bombing Sunday of police vehicles in
which one officer was killed and 15 people were injured in the town
of Eibar.
   The group has been waging a 20-year campaign for a homeland in
the northern Basque region. Since 1968, ETA has claimed
responsibility for attacks that have killed more than 600 people.

<HEAD>Many Priests Overworked, Lonely and Sexually Troubled, Bishops Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``serious and substantial morale problem''
afflicts the nation's 53,500 Roman Catholic priests, many of whom
are overworked, lonely and sexually troubled, says a groundbreaking
report by a panel of U.S. bishops.
   Discussing openly problems that once were kept quiet, the
Bishops' Committee on Priestly Life and Ministry said some priests
are just going through the motions, and many ``have settled for a
part-time presence to their priesthood.''
   Part of the priests' morale problem, said the committee of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, comes from the feeling that
they are caught between Vatican directives and a Catholic laity that
is often at odds with Rome.
   Pope John Paul II has urged priests to accept suffering as part
of their fate, but the American bishops have said that is not
helpful and have compiled suggestions on how to improve priests'
morale.
   The panel report, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, said
there are many creative and energetic priests, but ``it is also
clear to us that there exists today a serious and substantial morale
problem among priests in general.''
   The report was hailed by Catholic clerics as the first official
recognition of the situation's gravity.
   ``I think it's very encouraging that the bishops are helping the
priests name the pain,'' said the Rev. Frank J. McNulty, who
represented U.S. priests before the pope last year in Miami.
``They're putting in this document what we've said ourselves over a
cup of coffee. And that's a great help when you're trying to solve a
problem.''
   Bishop John McRaith of the Owensboro, Ky., diocese, led the
subcommittee that drafted the report. It was written for the
nation's 300 bishops only, but church leaders decided in November to
distribute it to priests.
   ``There really has been no scientific analysis done of the morale
of priests,'' McRaith said Saturday. ``I think our point was that
the morale of priests always needs attention.''
   The shortage of priests is both a cause and a result of the
morale problem, according to the report. A recent study by the
Hartford Seminary's Center for Social and Religious Research said
the number of Catholic seminarians declined from 8,885 in 1965 to
4,063 in 1985, and estimated that the number of priests will decline
40 percent by the year 2000. About 15 percent of priests have left
the priesthood since 1970, said Dean R. Hoge, a sociologist at
Catholic University of America.
   ``Am I in a dying profession?'' is the question that is starting
to demoralize many priests, said sociologist Martin Marty of the
University of Chicago. ``There's that sense: Did I bet on the wrong
thing?''
   Mandatory celibacy is a major reason for clergy leaving the
priesthood and for loneliness among those who stay, the bishops
said. The church has not helped priests deal with their sexual
feelings as it should, they said.
   They recommended that a priest's sexuality be recognized as an
``essential component of human existence'' and that better methods,
including encouraging close friendships with men and women, be found
to help priests lead a celibate life.
   ``There's just no support for that kind of life now,'' McRaith
said. ``They are surrounded by a culture that is incredibly
promiscuous.''
   With rectories that used to be filled with half a dozen or so
priests often housing just one today, the problem of loneliness is
exacerbated. Loneliness ``is often mentioned by priests as cause for
anxiety and pain,'' the report said.
   Another result of the shortage is that where priests could once
look forward to a graceful retirement, now they face heavier
workloads, ``long and painful battles over consolidation and closure
of parishes, and less probability of retirement at all.''
   The dwindling number of priests is ministering to a larger flock.
The U.S. Catholic population rose from 48 million in 1970 to 53.5
million in 1988.
   In reaction, the bishops said, many priests have chosen to ``drop
out quietly. This is particularly true of those in the 45 to 60 age
group who are willing to go through the necessary minimum of motions
but whose hearts and energies are elsewhere.''
   In his speech to U.S. priests last fall, the pope told them to
bear their hardship with faith. ``The spirit God has given us is no
cowardly spirit,'' he said.
   But the bishops' committee is saying ``you have to do more than
tough it out. There are things that might be done,'' McNulty said.
   The Vatican's closing off discussion on issues such as celibacy
and the ordination of women results in priests being ``caught in the
middle,'' the panel said.
   ``Some priests feel that at times they are passing on to
parishioners, who clearly disagree, pastoral decisions which they
sense their bishops do not fully endorse and which they themselves
personally question,'' it said.
   The committee recommended giving priests greater authority in
making decisions that affect their lives, including participation in
the selection of bishops.
   But McRaith minimized the differences between U.S. priests and
the Vatican.
   ``There are some things that are not resolvable, and that
(celibacy) may be one,'' he said. ``So they (priests) have to be
careful how they ask those questions.''

   Time magazine has named the ``endangered Earth''
its Planet of the Year, departing from its annual Man of the Year
designation to call for ``a universal crusade to save the planet.''
   ``This year the Earth spoke, like God warning Noah of the
deluge,'' the weekly newsmagazine said, citing natural and
human-caused disasters from earthquakes to overpopulation to
pollution of the world's beaches.
   Since 1927, Time annually has selected the person, group or
object that in its editors' views most significantly influenced
world events that year. It selected an inanimate object once before
_ the computer, in 1982.
   In the cover article of its Jan. 2 issue, released Saturday, Time
warned of a series of impending environmental catastrophes:
   _Pollution-caused warming of the atmosphere, known as the
``greenhouse effect,'' threatening weather changes that could flood
coastlines and render large areas of the planet infertile and
uninhabitable.
   _Toxic and radioactive wastes and dumped garbage that could
poison drinking water and despoil the land.
   _Chemical pollution that is depleting the atmosphere's protective
ozone layer.
   _Clearing of tropical rain forests, driving thousands of species
to extinction.
   ``Most of these evils had been going on for a long time, and some
of the worst disasters apparently had nothing to do with human
behavior,'' Time said. ``Yet this year's bout of freakish weather
and environmental horror stories seemed to act as a powerful
catalyst for worldwide public opinion.
   ``Everyone suddenly sensed that this gyrating globe, this
precious repository of all the life we know of, was in danger. No
single individual, no event, no movement captured imaginations or
dominated headlines more than the clump of rock and soil and water
and air that is our common home.''
   Added Time: ``Now, more than ever, the world needs leaders who
can inspire their fellow citizens with a fiery sense of mission, not
a nationalistic or military campaign but a universal crusade to save
the planet.''

   To the wails of her mother, Svetlana
Arikilyan was laid to rest in this devastated city on Saturday after
grave diggers cut a hole in the black frozen earth with a jackhammer.
   ``Oh, my darling girl! Farewell! Farewell!'' a weeping Varsik
Arikilyan exclaimed as pallbearers holding two worn ropes lowered
her 36-year-old daughter's wooden coffin, draped in a royal blue
cloth, into the ground.
   She cast a handful of dirt on the coffin, then turned away in
agony.
   ``For us Armenians, there can be no holidays this year. No New
Year's, no Christmas,'' said Edik Kasparyan, a Leninakan teacher.
``There has been too much loss, too much death.''
   Armenia's second-largest city, 11 miles east of the Turkish
border, is still reeling from the Dec. 7 earthquake that Soviet
officials estimate killed 55,000 people.
   As Soviets elsewhere prepare for the New Year's holiday and its
rituals of gift-giving and family get-togethers, Armenians still are
counting their dead and digging out from the ruins of the deadliest
earthquake in their nation's history.
   Survivors come in gratitude to kiss the stone walls of
Leninakan's Armenian Catholic Church of the Seven Wounds, whose bell
tower toppled to the ground, but whose sanctuary was spared by the
great quake.
   For the survivors, there is also sorrow, pain, hunger and anger.
Day and night, when the temperature drops near zero, the grisly
search for the dead goes on.
   Shortly after dawn, rescuers combing the wreckage of a nine-story
apartment building gently freed the body of 29-year-old Dina
Mikhailovna. By her side was the body of her child, who could have
been no more than 1{ years old, a smashed baby stroller and a
plastic fir tree that the family had bought for the holidays.
   Mother and child were placed in a coffin made from particle board
and painted black. Six men struggled to carry it down a snow-frosted
mountain of smashed concrete and twisted pipes to a truck.
   Armenians, an ancient people who embraced Christianty as a state
religion more than 1,600 years ago, have canceled Christmas
festivities on Jan. 6, the date they and the other Eastern rites
usually celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.
   Martin Pashayan, 42, an Armenian who teaches French, was counting
on receiving a new three-room apartment for his family in time for
the New Year. Instead, his wife Knarik, 42, and his daughter and son
died when their eighth-floor apartment crashed down around them.
   ``For the first week, I was out of my mind with grief,'' said the
haggard, sunken-eyed Pashayan. ``But then I realized that if I had
been left alive, it was to live. I asked, `Why me?' When I look
around I see that everyone here suffered. Every family.''
   Once home to more than 280,000 people, Leninakan today has only
100,000 inhabitants, thousands of whom now live in tents. Many
residents have been evacuated.
   Tens of thousands of homes, schools for 63,000 students,
nurseries for 15,000 children and hospitals with nearly 5,000 beds
will have to be built or repaired in the disaster area in two years,
Tass said. Its report came from a meeting in Moscow Saturday of the
Council of Ministers, or Cabinet.
   Speakers at the meeting said government agencies had taken a
``businesslike and efficient approach'' in the search and rescue.
But in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, a commission of the ruling
Politburo said the relief effort was not going smoothly, according
to Tass.
   In Leninakan, hundreds of people maintain a vigil by bonfires
that burn around the clock near about 200 wrecked and toppled
buildings, waiting until bodies of their loved ones are borne from
the smashed concrete and dust.
   ``I lost my whole family, my daughter, my son. Now I have no one
to live with,'' said 70-year-old Avetik Alexanyan. He then began to
cry.
   Trucks bring bread and lumps of hot boiled meat to Leninakan's
central square to feed the homeless, but some families receive only
parcels of cold food.
   Near the city's medical clinic, closed because of earthquake
damage, people lined up at 6 a.m. to receive donated clothes from
abroad. Eight hours later, scores of people were still waiting.
   A group of 50 West German relief workers gathered Saturday night
for hot spiced wine from jerry cans and Christmas Eve dinner. A tape
recorder played Christmas carols, including ``The First Noel,'' but
there was scant holiday cheer.

<BYLINE>Home For Christmas: Do Homeless Prefer The Grate?
^By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As President Reagan basks in the warmth of a
California Christmas, the homeless people he said prefer to live on
the streets gather around their flameless urban campfires in the wet
chill of the capital.
   A sparsely decorated pine tree stands propped against a street
lamp as a group of sturdy young men stamp their feet on a street
grate above the city's underground network of heat and steam pipes.
   These men are four blocks from the White House, where this week
Reagan spoke of the homeless during a television interview with
ABC's David Brinkley.
   ``Those people still prefer (being) out there on the grates or
the lawn to going into one of those shelters,'' the president said
in the interview broadcast Thursday.
   The American Civil Liberties Union called Reagan's remarks ``mean
spirited and insensitive,'' saying the number of homeless has
increased dramatically during his administration. Estimates range in
the hundreds of thousands, with more than 15,000 in the nation's
capital.
   But some of the ``grate people'' say Reagan was correct, in a
sense, about their preferences.
   ``Given the choice of one of the grates and the urine and the
lice and the maggots (in shelters), I'll take the grates,'' said
Robert Jackson, as a stiff, hot updraft warmed a small circle of men
in their 20s and 30s.
   Others said the shelters were full anyway; they'd been turned
away.
   None of them much liked what Reagan said about street people,
especially his suggestion that most are mentally retarded. The
president spoke of the release of mental patients from hospitals in
the face of civil liberties demands:
   ``They wanted freedom, but they walked out to where there was
nothing for them, and they are a large percentage of that group that
you see out there,'' Reagan said.
   Again, some of the street people think Reagan was partially
correct.
   ``It was all done with good intentions when they started
releasing people who were not a danger to others,'' said Robert
Moens, 29, who is clean, well-dressed, articulate and living over
the grates across the street from the State Department. ``But it's
more inhuman to let them stay out here and fend for themselves. Some
of them are psychotic and should be locked up.''
   Moens said the young men in his group are on the streets to avoid
the drug addicts, serious drunks, transvestites, criminals and
psychotics who they say infest some of the shelters in the city.
   The Sheriff, Go Go Joe and the others who live over the grates
make an odd family.
   A few said they have jobs but can't save enough to pay the
minimum $65 a week for flophouse rent.
   Reagan told Brinkley there are lots of jobs in Washington:
   ``How could they be out there when every week ... you'll find
from 60 to 75 full pages of help-wanted ads in the Washington
paper?'' the president asked.
   Go Go Joe, who prides himself on good personal hygiene and
professes a deep Christian faith, said he has had several
$3.35-an-hour, minimum-wage jobs.
   ``I challenge President Reagan to live on that,'' he said.
   The Sheriff, who would not give his real name, showed his photo
on a plastic Defense Department identification card and said he was
working at the Pentagon and comes home to his park benches at night.
   He showed a recent color photo of his 11-year-old daughter. He
said he sends her money every time he gets paid.
   ``I don't want pity,'' he said. ``I'm just in Washington trying
to get a foothold. This is our living room and that's our television
set.'' He pointed at a partially demolished building, a classy
apartment house, a drug store and Riverside Liquors.
   Liquor store co-owner Brian Fischer has a different view of the
grates.
   Some of the men are his friends. One once brought him to tears, a
fellow named Allen who came in so cold he couldn't fasten his jacket.
   ``When he asked me to help him zip up, I got an image of my
7-year-old kid, and I cried,'' said Fischer.
   He agreed that some have serious mental problems. When one of the
grate people lay down in the middle of E Street and started shooting
at the sky with his fingers, Fischer said he telephoned for the
police and an ambulance. Then, because it was lunchtime, he ordered
a pizza.
   The pizza arrived first, and the authorities a couple of hours
later, he said.
   And when an elderly, white-bearded derelict called Wolfman died a
few weeks ago after living on the streets for more than two decades,
he lay on a grate for three hours before anyone came to take away
the body, Fischer said.
   ``The president has a very valid point about them preferring to
live on the grates rather than in the Washington shelters,'' said
Fischer. ``But criminals in prison are treated better than these
people.''
   Another view of the homeless was offered Saturday by House
majority whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., in the Democratic Party's
weekly radio broadcast.
   ``The reality is,'' Coelho said, ``most of them are not much
different from you or me. They are the elderly, the veterans, the
physically disabled and the chronically ill. They are the drug and
alcohol dependent. They're the migrant farm workers ... But in ever
increasing numbers, America's homeless are working families with
kids.''
   Coelho said that while ``Ronald Reagan never understood this
issue'' of homelessness, Democrats were convinced his successor,
George Bush, ``will make a serious effort to deal with the tragedy
of homelessness.''

   Actor Harrison Ford, who has had a string of
successful films since he was discovered in ``American Graffiti'' 15
years ago, says his success comes from ``not giving up.''
   ``Most people in this business gave up and went on to other
things,'' Ford says in Sunday's edition of Parade magazine.
   ``If you simply didn't give up, you would outlast the people who
came in on the bus with you. I knew it was going to take 10 or 15
years.''
   Ford, who starred as Han Solo in the ``Star Wars'' trilogy and

   ``Nobody really falls over themselves over celebrities here,''
said Vino. ``Were Quayle to come into the store, I'd treat him as I

<HEAD>Bush Tabs Elizabeth Dole As Labor Secretary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush on Saturday named
Elizabeth H. Dole as his secretary of labor, saying she has the
``experience, the stature and the ability'' to cope with the
challenges of America's changing work force.
   Mrs. Dole, 52, former transportation secretary and the wife of
Bush's bitter campaign rival, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., is the first woman named to a full Cabinet post in the new
administration, though Carla Hills, as the U.S. trade
representative, will have Cabinet rank.
   Bush said a ``dramatic change'' has occurred as women enter the
work force in increasing numbers, and, ``In this environment, it is
essential that we have a secretary of labor who understands the
challenges out there, and who has the experience, the stature and
the ability to deal with them effectively.''
   Other issues confronting the labor secretary are retraining
displaced workers, ensuring better job safety, creating
private-public partnerships and respecting workers' rights, the vice
president said.
   Bush's announcement, made the day before Christmas, means that
only once Cabinet job _ energy secretary _ remains open. Bush said
he would reveal no more appointments before next Friday, following
his return from a hunting and fishing trip in Texas and Alabama.
   Mrs. Dole, standing next to Bush outside the vice president's
mansion, said unemployment was at a 14-year low, but people were
still unable to find work.
   ``To promote and protect the welfare of America's working men and
women, America's working families, is a challenge I accept with
great enthusiasm,'' she said. Mrs. Dole said she would give a high
priority to issues such as child care and the homeless.
   Bush's selection drew praise from labor leaders as well as from
key members of the Senate, which will have to confirm Mrs. Dole's
nomination to succeed Ann Dore McLaughlin.
   ``President-elect Bush saved one of his best appointments until
near the end,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. ``She is a woman of
great ability with many friends in both parties on Capitol Hill.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the ranking Republican on the
committee, said Mrs. Dole brings to the job ``a proven track
record.'' At the Transportation Department, she pushed for safety
issues, including requirements for passive restraints in automobiles.
   ``It looks like TV dinners for me again, but I'll still probably
vote for her confirmation,'' Sen. Dole joked. Dole said his wife,
whom he and others call ``Liddy,'' will give ``110 percent to make a
difference for America.''
   Bush said the fact that Mrs. Dole is married to the minority
leader played no role in his decision. ``This appointment stands on
its merits,'' he said. He joked that he would love to see some side
benefits of the appointment, adding, ``Bob and I are on good
footing.''
   A North Carolina native and a Harvard-trained lawyer, Mrs. Dole
left her post as transportation secretary to work on her husband's
unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign. After Bush seized the GOP
nomination, she traveled around the country speaking on his behalf,
often to evangelical groups.
   Mrs. Dole has long been rumored for a spot in the Bush
administration and was on Bush's short list of vice presidential
running mates. She was known to have wanted the position of U.N.
ambassador, a job Bush gave to career diplomat Thomas Pickering.
   Before moving to transportation, Mrs. Dole was a high-ranking
White House staffer, serving as a liaison between President Reagan
and special interest groups. She had contacts then with organized
labor. Before Reagan's election in 1980, Mrs. Dole was a member of
the Federal Trade Commission.
   Said AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland: ``We look forward to
working with her. She is a person of proven stature and wide
experience in public life who will give the Labor Department an
important voice in the affairs of interest to working Americans.''
   On specific labor issues, Bush said he still favors raising the
minimum wage, but he did not know when he might ask Congress to take
that step. He was also non-commital on broadening job protection for
parents who want to take leaves when children are born or fall ill.
   Mrs. Dole, like many of Bush's Cabinet members, is a Washington
veteran, prompting questions about Bush's stated commitment to bring
fresh faces to the nation's capital.
   Bush dismissed the idea that his Cabinet does not have enough new
blood. ``The fact that somebody has had experience should not rule
her face or his face into an `old face' category,'' he said.
   Besides the post of energy secretary, Bush said he still is
looking for someone to fill the new post of drug czar. William Raab,
head of the U.S. Customs Service, is known to be interested in that
slot.
   Recent speculation for the energy job centered on Peter Johnson,
a former administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration;
former U.S. Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana and Lt. Gen. James A.
Abrahamson, head of the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization at
the Pentagon.
   Through Saturday, Bush had filled 13 Cabinet positions.

   Shawn Pryer and Jennifer Crandon had
planned to get married next summer but they decided a Christmas
surprise for their parents would be more fun.
   So the northeast Kansas couple bypassed their church and took the
minister along as they headed out Thursday to Santa's house at the
Manhattan Town Center Mall.
   The former Miss Crandon, 23, who works at a hair salon at the
mall, wore a long white dress with train and veil. Santa wore red as
he gave her away.
   ``We just like doing stuff that's unique and fun,'' Pryer said
Friday. ``And we'd never heard of anyone doing something like this
before.''
   He said the couple planned to go home Christmas Eve and tell
their parents.
   ``It's like a Christmas present to both sets of parents,'' said
Pryer, 21, a student at Kansas State University. ``We're just going
to wait and see whether they notice (the rings).''

   Although chances for snow were slim in the
Indianapolis area, at least one local youngster will have a white
Christmas.
   Cara Curtis, 10, earned the honor when she won the city
Department of Parks and Recreation's first Wishing for a Winter
Wonderland essay contest.
   A dump truck pulled up in front of her family's home Friday
morning, and delivered ice shavings that had been collected at the
city's two ice rinks.
   Cara and her friends raced through the man-made snow, slipping
and sliding and making snowballs _ one of which landed squarely on
the nose of Mayor William H. Hudnut III.
   Cara's winning essay selected from 1,044 entries talked about the
magical qualities of snow.
   ``You can pretend that you are trudging through the arctic with
penguins sliding into the sparkling water when you play in the snow.
Or you can travel to an enchanted land or become an Olympic figure
skater swishing around on the glittering ice.''

   Her home was gutted by a fire blamed on a
short in Christmas tree lights, but Diana Bojorquez said the holiday
has been salvaged by the generosity of others.
   Even as the fire burned Thursday morning, people began offering
help, Ms. Bojorquez said Friday.
   ``Maybe it's because it's the Christmas season,'' she said. ``It
started when we were standing outside watching our home burn. People
gave us clothing and my daughter a pair of shoes right there.
   A collection among city workers in this community 200 miles north
of Los Angeles produced $575 in cash, furniture and a 15-pound
Christmas turkey for Ms. Bojorquez and her 7-year-old daughter,
Adrienne.
   ``It's going to be a nice Christmas after all,'' Ms. Bojorquez
said.

   Some truck stops in Georgia are providing
Christmas trees, decorations and a variety of holiday treats to help
cheer up lonely drivers who cannot be with their families.
   At the Perlis Truckstop along Interstate 75 in central Georgia,
truckers will be greeted by Santa Claus and free Christmas dinners,
said general manager Leon Perlis.
   ``They're very appreciative of it,'' he added. ``Most of them are
feeling poorly because they're not at home on Christmas.''
   John Lee, restaurant shift manager at the Truckstops Of America
location in Conley, said his truck stop would provide a free buffet
meal that includes turkey, chicken, ham, stuffing, yams and pumpkin
pie.
   ``We appreciate them,'' Lee said. ``We're not a greedy outfit.
We're just trying to say `Happy Holiday.' They've got to have a
place when they're away from home.''

   A father is keeping alive the memory of his
dead son with acts of Christmas kindness for residents of a school
for the retarded.
   C.J. Moore, 58, collects and recycles about 10 tons of aluminum
cans a year so he can treat residents of the Hammond State School to
dinner and presents.
   C.J. Moore III, or Jay, was 16 when he died eight years ago. He
was retarded, but never stayed at the Hammond State School.
   Moore and his wife, Gloria, held their first party at the school
about 10 years ago, using money he earned by walking the highways
picking up aluminum cans and stashing bags of them in the woods
until he could bring his pickup truck around. He owned his own scrap
metal company.
   Now, diabetes keeps him from walking much, and he relies on other
people to donate cans at collection bins at grocery stores, camp
grounds and in his front yard in Hammond, 35 miles northwest of New
Orleans.
   Some 40 residents of the school receive a box of candy, a dollar
bill and other gifts adding up to $35.
   ``You might say, `Well, that ain't many,' but when you've got to
wrap 320 gifts, it is,'' Moore said.

   The House of Commons on Saturday approved the
Canada-U.S. free trade agreement as opposition lawmakers sang the
country's national anthem to protest what they said was a sellout of
Canada's sovereignty.
   The sweeping legislation will begin breaking down trade and
business barriers with the United States as early as New Year's Day.
   ``People will look back on this and say it was a good day for
Canada,'' said Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He said the agreement,
which was approved by a vote of 141-111, would bring economic
prosperity.
   In Washington, a U.S. administration trade official welcomed the
Commons vote, saying the trade pact would spur economic growth on
both sides of the border.
   ``We're just very pleased the Canadian Parliament has acted
positively on the free-trade agreement,'' said Kelly Winkler,
spokesman for Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
   The agreement was the focus of national elections Nov. 21, in
which Mulroney's Progessive Conservative Party won a second
consecutive majority government.
   ``It was a tough road; this is a rough business,'' Mulroney told
reporters outside the Commons, which had met past midnight.
   Legislators of the opposition Liberal Party sang ``O Canada,''
the Canadian national anthem, to protest passage of the bill.
Members of another opposition group, the New Democrats, were silent
as they voted against it.
   The pact is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 after consideration
by the Senate, which has promised to approve the legislation next
week.
   Under the agreement, all remaining tariffs between the two
neighbors are to be phased out over a 10-year period. Trade between
the United States and Canada was about $160 billion last year.
   The opposition bitterly opposed the pact on the ground that it
would cost Canadians jobs. After the election, the Commons was
recalled Dec. 12 to deal with the agreement.
   Mulroney signed the trade agreement with President Reagan in
January. It was approved by the U.S. Congress.

<TEXT>
   The following is a text of Pope John Paul
II's homily for Christmas Eve midnight Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.
The original was to be given in Italian. The following is the
Vatican's official English-language version:
   ``I bring you good news of a great joy for to you is born ... a
savior'' (Luke 2:10-11).
   We hear this voice which emanates from the depths of the night of
Bethlehem. The shepherds ``keeping watch over their flock by night''
(Luke 2:8) were the first to hear it. For this reason the Midnight
Liturgy is sometimes called the ``Shepherds' Mass.''
   We are gathered in St. Peter's Basilica to hear once more these
same words: ``I bring you good news of a great joy.''
   By means of radio and television, peoples of different languages,
nations, countries and continents are listening with us to this
message. Thus, again in the different parts of the world.
   And even if the words which we hear on Christmas night are the
same every year, yet they are always eagerly awaited by us and are
for us always new.
   ``Today ... is born ... a savior, who is Christ the Lord.'' He is
born once more. Once more he has come into the world, on the night
of Bethlehem. For we relive as ours that distant ``today'' of almost
2,000 years ago.
   ``A Savior is born to you.'' It may seem that people have
achieved a great deal, and continue to do so, in ``saving''
themselves with their own resources, so that they may be
self-sufficient, that all the things that are termed
``civilization,'' ``progress'' and ``development'' do not reach the
roots of the evil which still persists in human history and even, in
a sense, is becoming deeper and more widespread. And, on the other
hand, all the things that help to ``raise'' the level of human
existence, that make it ``better,'' do not reach the perfection of
that good to which the human being is directed.
   Meanwhile the words: ``A savior is born to you'' continue to
touch what is permanent and real in man, what is profoundly true.
And every year these words are awaited with the same basic
motivations in our humanity, even if we are very often unaware of
them.
   On that night, the shepherds in Bethlehem experienced deep
amazement. What they heard at first filled them with fear. But, ``do
not be afraid'' the Messenger says, ``I bring you good news of great
joy.''
   At the moment in which God the Son, of the same substance as the
Father is born as man, comes into the world as a son of man, as the
son of Mary, we cannot but be overcome by deep amazement. The whole
Gospel is the book of great amazement.
   For God is eternal and invisible. He is all-embracing. ``In him
we live and move and have our being'' (Acts 17:28). God is
omnipotent. He is totally other: different from the whole of
creation. He is absolute Transcendence.
   Is it possible that he becomes man? That he is born in an
abandoned stable, as a child of homeless parents?
   Why? Cur Deus homo (Why did God become Man)?
   The night of Bethlehem is the wellspring of this amazement. The
first to experience it were these shepherds. And in this amazement
there was first fear, and then joy. It is not something transitory.
It is preserved by the human consciousness for the whole of life.
   Every individual must constantly ask the question: cur Deus Homo?
He must constantly seek the answer and find it gradually. He must
embrace the mystery revealed this night and enter into it ever more
deeply.
   Yes. The mystery.
   It is good when one experiences fear, an interior tremor. And it
is also good when one finds joy. But it is not good when one or the
other is missing. It is not good. Man cannot remain indifferent to
the mystery of the night of Bethlehem. He cannot reject the question
cur Deus homo?
   This would constitute a deep ``wound'' in his humanity.
   Thus all people are called to share in this night... ``Declare
his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the
peoples.'' ( See also Psalms 95@96:3).
   In the context of the Christmas mystery, human history, the
history of each and every individual _ is called to overcome that
limit which can interiorly obstruct the journey towards the
salvation offered by God. People can ignore this call. They can even
refuse to accept it. But ``salvation'' cannot come to them except
from God. And it has come! On this very night.
   God is born as man, who is a creature. Does not the whole of
creation find its place in this mystery?
   What significance has the fact that we invite earth and sea to
share in the joy of Christmas?
   ``Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice, Let the sea
roar, and all that fills, let the field exult and everything in it.
Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy.'' (Psalms
95@96:11-12.)
   Bethlehem _ it literally means the ``house of bread.''
   Christ, who was born there, without a roof, will construct in the
history of the world a dwelling which corresponds to the meaning of
this place: Bethlehem.
   The House of Bread: The Eucharist.
   He himself, the savior, will live in this house in a sacramental
manner. Indeed, he will actually be this house: His Body and his
Blood. The whole of humanity, in which the divine transformation of
man has its origin.
   In this way, man will constantly be able to overcome the limit
placed in the way of salvation _ eternal salvation _ which God
himself has opened up with the human birth of the Word, his Eternal
Son. With the human birth of God.
   Truly.
   ``The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light
shined'' (Isiah 9:1).
   Truly.
   ``Fear not, behold I bring you good news of great joy.''

<HEAD>Polisario Front To Meet Morocco in First Contact in 13 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Polisario Front announced Saturday it
is sending a top-level delegation to meet Morocco's King Hassan II.
It would be the first such encounter since Polisario guerrillas went
to war with Morocco 13 years ago.
   No date for the meeting or names of delegates were given.
   The statement issued here by the Polisario Front said the
initiative follows a declaration by the Moroccan monarch to the
French press that he was ready to meet Polisario officials.
   The group called Hassan's statement ``a constructive position
taken in response to repeated calls by the Polisario for dialogue.''
   The talks would be the first direct contacts between Morocco and
the Polisario or its political structure, the Saharawi Arab
Democratic Republic, since the guerrilla group began fighting
Morocco for independence for the Western Sahara, annexed by Morocco
in 1975.
   The Polisario statement said the group would cooperate fully with
the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations, which have
been seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict.
   Both Morocco and the Polisario have agreed in principle to a
referendum on the future of the Western Sahara.
   However, the statement reiterated Polisario's stance that
Moroccan troops and administration in the disputed territory remain
an obstacle to the process and should be removed.
   Polisario declared the Western Sahara a republic in February
1976. It has since been recognized by 45 countries, 27 of them
Organization of African Unity members.
   Morocco quit the group in 1980 when the Saharawi Arab Democratic
Republic became a member.

   Christmas came early this year for a disabled
boy who told Santa the only gift he wanted was a wheelchair for his
mom.
   A motorized wheelchair arrived Friday from Buffalo, N.Y., for
Victoria Coslett, 39. Weeks ago, it appeared that Ms. Coslett and
her 10-year-old son, John Wonggoun, would not celebrate Christmas.
   With his mother confined to their apartment and unable to
maneuver her old wheelchair outdoors to watch him play, Wonggoun
wrapped empty boxes to place under the sparsely decorated Christmas
tree, then sat down and wrote Santa.
   His letter said: ``The only gift i would like is an elecric
wheelchair for my mom. She can't walk and her hands are to weak for
the one welfair gave her 2 years ago. I would love to see her
outside without help and watch me play. Can you help me with my
wish?''
   The note made it as far as the U.S. Postal Service in Palm
Springs, where Denise Reusche, a clerk, opened the letter.
   Each year, the post office in the desert resort processes about
1,000 letters to Santa. Workers usually send a letter in return.
   But when Ms. Reusche read John's letter, she decided to contact
Fortress Scientific Co., a Buffalo wheelchair manufacturer, which
shipped the gift.
   Ms. Coslett and John were injured in a 1981 traffic crash. She
was left with ruptured spinal discs. John was partially brain
damaged and suffers recurring seizures and memory lapses. He also
has juvenile arthritis.

<TEXT>
   A convenience store clerk was treated to a
little adult entertainment when a man stripped down to a G-string
and leather jacket and bumped and ground his way down the candy
aisle.
   Circle K clerk Annette Ochoa said a man entered the store about 3
a.m. Friday and asked if he could use the restroom. She told him
this wasn't permitted to customers, and the man smiled and left.
   But minutes later he returned while she was talking on the phone.
   ``When I looked up, he was standing there with nothing but a
G-string and leather jacket on,'' Ochoa said. ``I told my friend,
`I've got a stripper, I'll have to call the cops.'''
   Once the stripper had her attention, he began performing.
   ``He walked up, picked up a Thrifty Nickel (newspaper) and did
some pumping motions, if you know what I mean,'' Ochoa said.
   ``Then he went down one aisle and then came up the candy aisle
and stood in front of the candy counter and did some more of his
motions. He heard me say I was calling the police, but he just stood
there until I dialed the numbers. Then he left.''
   The stripper didn't know when to quit his act though. He was
arrested on a complaint of indecent exposure shortly after he
appeared outside another convenience store. He was released without
any charge being filed, but police are still investigating.
   ``I was talking to my friend (at a second store) when she spotted
the guy walking around outside her store,'' Ochoa said. ``About that
time a cop walked in to ask me some follow-up questions and I told
him what was going on. He radioed it in and a cop who was nearby
caught him near the store on Lakeshore Drive. He was only wearing
his G-string and a leather jacket.''
   Ochoa says the strip show was something of a shock. Still, she
believes something good came from his performance.
   ``It kept me awake.''

<HEAD>Former Afghan King, Soviet Official Hold Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with details of peace plan. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union opened talks Saturday with the
exiled king of Afghanistan about a new peace plan for the war-torn
country, officials said.
   Yuli Vorontsov, Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan and a first
deputy foreign minister, said the talks with the exiled king focused
on a proposal for convening a council in Afghanistan of 50 to 60
politicians or prominent individuals to create a new government.
   Afghan rebels have spoken recently about forming a broad-based
government to succeed the Soviet-backed regime. But Vorontsov's
comments were the most detailed yet made publicly about the new
proposal.
   The Soviet official said his government had presented the plan to
Pakistan-based Moslem rebels earlier this month and ``we are still
waiting for (their) word.''
   Vorontsov said the two-hour session Saturday with former King
Mohammad Zaher Shah was ``very useful.'' Zaher Shah has lived in
Italy since he was overthrown in 1973.
   ``We had a very long extensive discussion which covered lots of
elements of the plan, of the future, (of) possibilities,'' he told
reporters at the residence of the Soviet ambassador to Rome.
   He declined, however, to say whether the king was receptive to
going back to Afghanistan as part of a transitional government.
   While the 74-year-old ex-king still has a following in
Afghanistan, some Moslem resistance groups remain strongly opposed
to him.
   The Soviets are anxious to see a stable government in place that
will end the 10-year-old Afghanistan war and not persecute Afghan
communists.
   Moscow signed an accord with the United States in April under
which the Soviets are to withdraw their estimated 115,000 troops
from Afghanistan by Feb. 15, 1989.
   However, Moscow has since suspended the pullout, charging that
there have been violations of the accords by the United States and
Pakistan, who back the rebels. The war has continued.
   Vorontsov declared that the different Afghan groups had to start
negotiating with each other.
   ``There is a suggestion that comes from Pakistan that the first
initial group of representatives of all kinds of political factions,
50-60 persons, get together, in the capacity of the representatives
of political parties or in their personal capacity as authoritative
figures, but sitting together starting to formulate the future of
Afghanistan,'' he said.
   He added that the group should form a ruling body or
administrative council that would govern until new elections could
be called.
   Vorontsov said the plan had the approval of some rebels, the
Pakistani government and the Afghan government. He said it would be
presented shortly to Afghan rebel groups based in Iran.
   The new ruling council could be put together by Feb. 15, he said.
   Vorontsov also said that several Afghan rebel groups were holding
secret talks with the Soviet-backed Najib government. The
Pakistan-based rebels have vowed never to deal with Najib.
   In an address to the United Nations earlier this month, Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev proposed a Jan. 1 cease-fire in
Afghanistan and a cut-off of all military supplies to the country.
   ``We still think that it is feasible to work with that target
date in mind,'' Vorontsov said.
   There was no comment from the former Afghan king about Saturday's
meeting, which took place at his walled compound in Rome. His
spokesman, Gen. Abdul Wali, told reporters that the Soviet official
``had been received for an exchange of views.''
   In the past, Zaher Shah has been guarded in his public
statements, saying that Afghan leaders should be assembled to decide
on a transition team.
   Afghanistan has been locked in civil war since the April 1978
revolution that brought a socialist government to power in the
Islamic nation.
   Soviet troops were sent to the neighboring country in 1979 to
prop up the allied government.
   Zaher Shah lost his throne when his cousin and former prime
minister, Mohammed Daud, seized power in July 1973. The king, who
had been in power for 40 years, was in Italy at the time, taking a
rheumatism cure at the baths in Ischia.
   Leftists in the army supported the coup and anti-communist exiles
believe it paved the way for the more openly pro-Soviet coup in 1978.

<TEXT>
   A man who spent more than 1{ years in
prison for rapes he did not commit has been awarded $110,000 by the
Ohio Court of Claims.
   Bradley Cox, 29, had sought more than $3.5 million for the one
year and 267 days he served at the Lebanon Correctional Institution
after he was convicted in 1980 in two counties on three counts of
rape, five counts of aggravated robbery and three counts of
aggravated burglary.
   Cox was serving a 77- to 275-year sentence in December 1981 when
Jon Simonis confessed to the crimes for which Cox had been
convicted. Simonis, a former Ohio resident who was imprisoned in
Louisiana, confessed to 80 attacks in 12 states, including the three
for which Cox was convicted.
   Cox was released from prison in January 1982 after Ohio
authorities interviewed Simonis.
   The state claims court on Monday awarded Cox $49,500 for the time
he spent in jail, $35,500 for lost wages during his imprisonment and
$25,000 for attorney's fees.
   Cox's stepmother, Johann Cox of Lithopolis, told The Columbus
Dispatch in 1986 that prison had scarred her stepson.
   ``He was pretty good when he first got out. He had high hopes,
but nothing seemed to work out for Brad. ... Prison made mincemeat
out of him,'' she said.
   In April 1987, Cox was arrested on charges of auto theft and
receiving stolen property in the central Ohio community of Lancaster.
   This August, Fairfield County Common Pleas Judge Joseph Clark
found Cox innocent by reason of insanity, and ordered him to undergo
further psychiatric treatment.

<TEXT>
   An express passenger train slammed into a bus
filled with peasants in northeast China, killing at least 46 people,
official reports said early Sunday.
   The train, bound for Beijing, was approaching a crossing in
Liaoning province on Friday night when the bus began to cross the
tracks, the Xinhua news agency said. Two rail cars overturned in the
crash, it said.
   National television said Saturday that 84 peasants were on the
bus, heading home to Inner Mongolia.
   The television report said 67 people were injured, many
critically, but the later Xinhua report put the number at 54. The
discrepancy could not immediately be resolved.
   The train began in the city of Dandong on the Chinese border with
Korea. Xinhua said the crash took place in central Liaoning near
Qinghemen, about 100 miles west of the provincial capital of
Shenyang.
   It said the engine and a second car were overturned and three
other train cars derailed.
   The TV showed the bus, mangled beyond recognition, and a row of
bodies at the scene. Neither it nor Xinhua said whether anyone on
the train was killed.
   Police are investigating the cause of the accident, the TV said.
   The collision was the fifth major train accident this year. The
most serious was a derailment in southwest China's Yunnan province
in January in which 88 people died. A train collision in Shanghai in
March killed 28 people, including 27 members of a Japanese high
school tour group.
   The minister of railways, Ding Guangen, resigned in disgrace in
early March after the first three accidents and his successor, Li
Senmao, promised to correct safety and maintenance failures blamed
for the earlier accidents.
   Trains are the main means of long-distance transport in China,
carrying about 1.2 billion passengers a year.

   Authorities in a district where
independent groups this month held their first legal rally in almost
20 years have called the rally anti-socialist and banned such
gatherings in the future, a newspaper said Saturday.
   The Communist party daily Rude Pravo said the ban was decided at
a meeting Thursday of officials from Prague's third district, close
to the city center, and organizers of the Dec. 10 rally marking 40
years of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   In the peaceful hour-long rally, called by five unofficial
groups, well-known independent activists addressed a public crowd
for the first time since the end of 1968's ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Several speeches called for peaceful changes in the current
system. At the end, a crowd of about 3,000 approved a declaration
calling for the release of all political prisoners, full religious
freedom, legalization of groups independent of the ruling Communist
party and a new constitution.
   Rude Pravo said the organizers of the Dec. 10 meeting ``were told
openly they did not adhere to the conditions under which they got
permission for the public gathering.''
   ``The content of slogans and some of the performances stepped
outside the boundaries of this covenant,'' wrote Rude Pravo
commentator Marie Boudova.
   The rally ``was aimed against Socialist order and proved the real
intention of organizers to misuse the gathering for political
provocation,'' she said.
   The decision was preceded by publication in Rude Pravo Dec. 15
and 16 of readers' letters attacking the Dec. 10 meeting.
   ``We cannot and must not let Czech Walesas infringe upon the
legal order, and what is worse, trifle with serious questions of
democracy and justice,'' wrote one reader Dec. 16, referring to
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa of Poland.
   Petr Uhl, one of the activists involved in negotiations with the
authorities before the Dec. 10 gathering, said there had been no
mention then of limits on the content of slogans or speeches at the
rally.
   ``It is false, quite false, that we the independent groups have
violated such conditions,'' he said.
   Uhl said neither of the two activists who met with authorities on
Thursday were in Prague over the Christmas weekend.

   A man jailed on drug charges got to go
home for Christmas after a judge threatened to jail his own cousin,
the chief criminal deputy in the sheriff's office, for refusing to
allow the furlough.
   ``I'm obeying the rules, but I'm protesting them,'' Chief
Criminal Deputy Ralph Stassi said after Carl Scioneaux, 27, of White
Castle was released Friday on a court order from State District
Judge Jack Marionneaux.
   Marionneaux's threat to send Stassi to jail is not the first
public rift between the cousins. The judge, who ordered Stassi out
of his court in 1985 after the chief deputy lambasted him during a
hearing, said his cousin has a grudge against him.
   The judge said Sheriff Freddie H. Pitre Sr. often lets prisoners
out, and Scioneaux is a ``local boy'' who is unlikely to jump bail.
   Stassi said Scioneaux, arrested Nov. 27 for possessing cocaine
and marijuana with intent to distribute them, has been arrested
repeatedly and didn't merit a weekend pass.
   The Clerk of Court's Office said Scioneaux was convicted in 1984
of burglary and in 1986 of marijuana possession.
   Scioneaux was being held on $60,000 bond when Marionneaux asked
for his release on a weekend pass, Stassi said. The sheriff refused
that request Friday morning, Stassi said.
   But when Marionneaux called later, the judge threatened to jail
his cousin, Stassi said.
   Marionneaux said that, because it was Christmas, he changed the
bond so Scioneaux could be released on his own recognizance.
   ``All of this goes back on him at 9 a.m. Monday. It's just a
weekend pass,'' the judge said.

<TEXT>
   The mayor of Bethlehem, in a
Christmas message, proposed a one-year truce between the Jewish
state and Palestinians struggling against Israeli occupation.
   Mayor Elias Freij also said Saturday that he hopes Israel would
accept the ``land for peace'' formula in Middle East peace talks.
   ``We hope the (Israeli) government will become more realistic and
accept territory for peace, rather than the concept of territory
with peace,'' he said on Israel radio.
   He proposed a U.N.-sponsored agreement to end violence in the
occupied territories and clashes between the Israeli and allied
forces and Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon.
   ``The Palestinians would be happy to accept a honorable truce. It
would be a great moral victory for them,'' he said in an interview
published Friday in the weekend edition of the Jerusalem Post daily.
   Freij proposed that the truce be signed by Israel and PLO chief
Yasser Arafat. Israel's new coalition government rules out talks
with the PLO, which it considers a terrorist organization.
   Under Freij's proposed accord, the yearlong Palestinian rebellion
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would
come to a halt.
   At least 333 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have been killed since
violence broke out in the occupied lands on Dec. 8, 1987.
   In return, Freij said, the bulk of Israeli troops would have to
withdraw from these territories, which Israel captured in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israel would also release 1,450 Palestinians now held in
adminitrative detention, reopen 20 universities and colleges in the
occupied lands, cancel expulsion orders against Palestinians and
stop the practice of house demolitions as punishment for guerrilla
activities.
   ``We have to be more optimistic, that next year there will be
more hope,'' Freij told the radio.
   He spoke as Christmas Eve began in the Palestinian city of
35,000, the birthplace of Jesus, and carols reverberated over
loudspeakers across Manger Square. But Christian pilgrims were
discouraged by drenching rain, heavy Israeli security and
Palestinian general strike.
   In the newspaper interview, Freij was quoted as saying his idea
could lay the groundwork for an international peace forum leading to
an agreement ``on internationally defined borders where both Israel
and Palestine each can live in peace.''
   Israel has raised different interim ideas to launch peace talks,
ranging from elections in the occupied lands to choose Palestinian
negotiators acceptable both to it and the PLO, to unilateral
autonomy or limited self-rule for Palestinians.
   But it says violence in the West Bank and Gaza must stop before
any such negotiations start. Arafat, on the other hand, has said
repeatedly that the Palestinian uprising will continue as liberation
struggle.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israeli radio that he
didn't know of ``any member of this government who accepts
negotiations with the PLO. What we are seeking is direct
negotiations with various Arab countries and the Palestinian Arab
population.''
   In downtown Tel Aviv, thousands of Israelis gathered under a
pouring rain at a city square to demand peace talks with the PLO.
The demonstration was led by the leftist Peace Now movement and was
attended by many left-wing legislators.
   Demonstrators held signs reading,``Talk peace with the PLO now,''
and ``Two countries for the two people.''
   Speakers urged the government to adopt a peace strategy based on
the recent U.S. decision to launch a dialogue with the PLO and what
they termed a ``change in the PLO approach'' towards Israel.

   Five Palestinians were
wounded Saturday in the occupied lands, one in a clash with Israeli
troops, and an Arab died of wounds suffered in an earlier clash with
soldiers, Arab hospitals and news reports said.
   Also Saturday, two Arabs died and three others were wounded as
they ``handled an explosive device'' in the small West bank village
of Marj en Naja, an army spokesman said. The army did not have any
further details.
   The streets of the biblical town of Bethlehem were nearly empty
for Christmas Eve as rain, tight Israeli security and an Arab strike
kept most of the town's 35,000 Palestinian residents indoors and
dissuaded tourists.
   Underground leaders of the Arab uprising declared Christmas Eve a
day of solidarity with the 334 Palestinians killed during the
year-old revolt. Fourteen Israelis also have died in the violence.
   In the village of Ijah near Nablus, a 55-year-old man, his wife
and two sons were wounded in the legs, said officials at Nablus'
Ittihad Hospital.
   Arab reports said the four were shot by a village mukhtar, or
local leader, who used an Israeli-issued weapon. Reasons for the
clash were not immediately clear.
   The Israeli news agency Itim said the clash began when several
masked people attacked the house of the mukhtar, who was accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, and injured six family
members.
   Israel radio quoted security sources as saying that a family feud
was behind the attack and that police were looking into the incident.
   In the Gaza Strip, stores were shut and the army closed three
schools after students set up rock barricades in the street and
pelted soldiers with stones.
   A 15-year-old boy from Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp was shot in
the right leg after a clash with troops, Arab doctors said.
   In Nablus, a 21-year-old Arab man who was shot in the head by
soldiers during a demonstration last week died of his wounds,
hospital officials said.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Palestinians hurled stones at police in
the Shuafat neighborhood. Police fired back tear gas and rubber
bullets and arrested 15 rioters, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A paraplegic woman disabled by head injuries
gave birth to a healthy girl who police believe was conceived when
the woman was raped in her hospital bed. The mother was unaware she
delivered the infant, police said.
   The woman, who is in her 20s, has been hospitalized at Deaton
Medical Center since the spring of 1987. She was admitted Thursday
to University Hospital with high temperature and abdominal pains and
gave birth there.
   The woman was not able to report any rape, and police learned of
the case only when the baby was born. They were told the victim
``was not able to resist or consent to sexual advances,'' said a
police spokeswoman. So far, there is no suspect.
   ``They (Deaton officials) said she was suffering from abdominal
pains and had a disshaped abdomen. They thought she had a blockage
in the bowels,'' said the victim's sister, her legal guardian.
   At University, physicians discovered the woman was nine months
pregnant and in labor. She gave birth to a healthy 8-pound, 3-ounce
girl without realizing what had taken place, a hospital official
said.
   The sister said family members will meet to discuss moving the
woman from Deaton, where she was placed on the advice of physicians
from the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center following her
treatment for accident injuries.
   ``I don't believe my mother or my brother will allow her to stay
there,'' said the sister, who has custody of the woman's young son
and plans to care for the newborn.
   ``I always thought Deaton patients were in protective care.
Somebody wasn't doing their job,'' she said.
   Errol G. Newport, administrator of the 320-bed facility, said
patient confidentiality prevented him from commenting on the case.
   The young woman was struck by a car in February 1987 when she ran
into traffic while trying to keep a girlfriend who had been drinking
from getting hit by a car, the sister said. The injuries left her
almost totally incapacitated and unable to talk.
   ``She can move her left leg a little and has involuntary movement
in her left hand,'' but is generally unaware of her surroundings,
the sister said.

<HEAD>Miami News `Conceputal' Sale Agreement Could Save Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of The Miami News has reached an agreement
in principle to sell the 93-year-old daily newspaper, which is
scheduled to shut down Dec. 31, the paper reported Saturday.
   Cox Enterprises has ``conceptually agreed'' to an amended offer
from an out-of-state investor group. Cox hopes to close the deal
before its self-imposed Dec. 31 deadline for selling the paper or
folding it, a Cox official said.
   Cox might consider keeping the paper open for a short time after
Dec. 31 if a deal appears imminent, said David Easterly, president
of the Atlanta-based Cox Newspapers division.
   ``We have conceptually agreed to what was submitted _ we did that
(Friday) _ and the next move is up to the bidder,'' Easterly said.
``There has been no contract signed and no earnest money put
forward. ... There is a lot still to be done. We are trying to get
this bidder to come in and make a deal.''
   Easterly would not discuss details of the amended offer.
   Friday's developments came a day after the U.S. Department of
Justice said it is investigating whether the planned closing of The
News violates antitrust laws. Easterly said the impending probe had
no effect on the negotiations.
   Easterly confirmed that a different offer was received late
Wednesday from the sole active bidder. Easterly declined to identify
the bidder, but Chicago newspaper consultant John R. Malone said
recently that it's an investor group he represents.
   On Oct. 14, Cox officials announced that The News would be closed
by next Saturday if it were not sold. They cited financial and
circulation losses.
   Under a joint operating agreement signed in 1966 with The Miami
Herald Publishing Co., The News' printing, circulation, advertising
and promotion services are provided by The Herald.
   The Justice Department probe centers on whether an amendment to
the agreement, which would allow Cox to close or sell The News now _
nine years before the original pact was to expire _ and continue
collecting a share of Herald profits for the next 33 years, violates
antitrust laws.
   Facilities being offered for sale by Cox include the newspaper's
name, subscription list and some newsroom equipment.
   Since the agreement with The Herald went into effect, The News'
circulation has declined from 112,000 to 48,000, Cox officials said.

<HEAD>25 People Hurt In Stampede At Disco Following Tear Gas Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tear gas was fired into a crowded disco near a U.S.
Air Force base in Okinawa on Saturday, and 25 people were injured in
the stampede, two critically, police said.
   About 200 people, most of them foreigners, were in the
second-floor disco at 1 a.m. when people began rushing down the
stairs to escape the gas, said a police official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The crowd panicked,'' he said.
   The official said some foreigners were among the 25 people
injured as they fell or were pushed down the stairs. The two people
in critical condition were a Japanese woman and Hong Kong Chinese
woman, he said. Both women initially were identified as Japanese.
   The two women were unconscious and were being treated at a
hospital, but were not in a life-threatening condition, police said.
The names of the injured were not immediately available.
   Police said they were investigating the incident in cooperation
with U.S. military authorities.
   The Apple House disco is in Okinawa's Uechi city near U.S. Kadena
Air Base and is frequented by foreigners, the police official said.
   Police refused to comment on whether U.S. servicemen may have
brought the tear-gas bomb into the disco. But the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. quoted an employee at the disco as saying he saw a foreigner
throw something in the room and then run out of the disco.
   The network showed pictures of the tear-gas canister it said had
been found in the disco. The tear-gas bomb is a type used by the
U.S. military, it said.
   U.S. military officials were not immediately available for
comment because of the Christmas weekend.
   In recent months, the U.S. military in Japan has been involved in
a series of incidents that have brought sharp criticism from the
Japanese press and government, and charges that it disregards public
safety.
   In October, numerous rifle bullets hit a civilian housing area
near a U.S. military firing range on Okinawa. The following month,
two U.S. Marine helicopters collided over the island, killing four
Marines.
   Also in November, a U.S. Navy skipper was transferred after his
ship fired practice shells in a commercial shipping area that came
within 330 yards of a Japanese coast guard vessel.
   About 64,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan under a mutual
security pact. Of the total, about 35,000 are stationed in Okinawa,
which has a population of 1.2 million.

   LOCKERBIE, Scotland _ Authorities found 84 more bodies Saturday
from the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 as this grief-stricken little
village tried to keep Christmas from being erased from its calendar.
   Police Chief John Boyd said there would be no scaling down of the
search until the bodies of all 258 people aboard the Boeing 747 and
those who died on the ground are located.
   Helicopters and more than 600 people searched miles of Scottish
countryside for victims of Wednesday night's crash, which showered
this quiet town with flames and shards of jagged metal.
   Among the dead is the CIA's station chief in Beirut, Lebanon,
U.S. officials said Saturday.
   In the town of 2,500 people, shops remained open and churches
held Christmas Eve services, but the heart had gone out of the
holiday. The Rev. Patrick Keegans of the town's Roman Catholic
Church, whose own home was destroyed in the crash, put Christmas
preparations aside Saturday to meet with relatives of the victims at
a counseling center in the parish hall.
   Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said Saturday night that 84 more
bodies were recovered after the search area was expanded, bringing
the total to 239.
   None of the bodies has been positively identified, and Kennedy
said it was a ``fair question'' whether all the remaining bodies
will ever be found.
   Six local residents listed as missing have been located alive and
one other has been confirmed as dead, Kennedy said. That leaves 10
townspeople still listed as missing.
   He said police also believed the occupants of only two cars
destroyed in the explosion were missing, since what was thought to
have been a third car was merely a license plate already in the road
when the disaster occurred.
   Officials earlier had not accounted for occupants of two other
cars caught in the inferno, but said Saturday that one driver had
been treated for injuries and the other already was on the list of
the missing.
   Searchers extended their hunt to more than 30 miles east of
Lockerbie. Papers, clothing, money and mail from the plane had been
found as far away as the Northumberland coast, 70 miles east of the
main crash site.
   Investigators were examining the flight's cockpit recording,
which ended with what they called a brief, mysterious ``faint
noise.''
   Suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the inexplicable sudden
breakup of the plane at 31,000 feet, a claim of responsibility and
disclosures that the U.S. government had been warned of a plot to
bomb a Pan Am flight between Frankfurt, West Germany, and New York
in December.
   Passengers and luggage of Flight 103 originated on a Boeing 727
in Frankfurt and switched to a Boeing 747 in London. The plane was
bound for New York when it crashed.
   But British aviation authorities, who are leading the crash
probe, say the cause still is unknown and there is no evidence to
suggest a bomb blew up the plane.
   In Washington, meanwhile, two U.S. officials said the Central
Intelligence Agency's station chief in Beirut, Lebanon, was on the
flight. One of the two officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there was no indication the station chief's presence
was connected to the crash.
   The CIA official was not identified.
   The mourning continued throughout Christmas Eve in the village.
   Christmas ``is really the furthest thing from my mind right now.
It's not important,'' said Joe Horgan, an American who had come to
the village, where a relative had died in Wednesday night's crash.
   Horgan, one of about 20 people who lost loved ones and came to
the crash scene in southwestern Scotland, met briefly with reporters
Saturday on condition that his hometown and any details about his
relative on the flight not be disclosed.
   Beneath the fanciful turreted tower of the town hall, a growing
pile of flowers testified to grief.
   One of the three dozen bunches, including Christmas holly, that
had been placed there said: ``God bless you Melina. We love you
always. Your father and mother.''
   A notice board carried condolences from Prince Charles and
Princess Diana, and from President Reagan.
   In London, Queen Elizabeth II broadcast an unprecedented second
Christmas message Saturday to comfort those who suffered in the Pan
Am jet crash, the Dec. 7 earthquake in Soviet Armenia and the Dec.
12 rail crash in south London that killed 34 people.
   She offered prayers and sympathy to the injured and bereaved and
said she hoped ``the eternal message of Christmas will bring some
comfort in the hour of sadness.''

   The Central Intelligence Agency's station chief
in Beirut, Lebanon, was among the 258 people aboard the Pan American
jumbo jet that exploded and crashed in Scotland, two U.S. officials
said Saturday.
   But there is no known reason to believe that he was a specific
target of terrorists or that his presence on Flight 103 was tied in
any other way to the disaster, one of the officials told The
Associated Press. ``I don't know of any specific link,'' the
official said.
   For the record, the Reagan administration declined to verify or
deny that the CIA agent was aboard the jetliner, as initially
reported by NBC News. ``As you know, we never comment on any such
allegation having to do with intelligence,'' Sondra McCarty, a State
Department spokeswoman, said.
   But two other U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the CIA station chief was on the ill-fated
flight from London's Heathrow Airport to New York. The two would not
identify the station chief.
   American, British, Israeli and Interpol investigators are trying
to determine whether the plane was the victim of sabotage, technical
malfunction or high winds. All aboard perished and 20 people who
resided near the crash site were missing and believed dead.
   Flight recorders recovered from the wreckage on Friday showed the
pilots engaged in routine conversation, with no warning signs
apparent before the Wednesday night crash. The tape ended abruptly
with a short, faint noise.
   The loss of the CIA station chief in Beirut is the latest setback
to U.S. intelligence operations in Lebanon. In April 1983, a
terrorist bomb that wrecked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut took the
lives of a number of CIA agents. In 1984, William Buckley, the U.S.
station chief, was kidnapped, tortured and killed, probably the next
year.
   The impact on U.S. intelligence-gathering and information about
American hostages was immeasurable. The State Department lists nine
Americans currently as hostages. Officials on Thursday denied
reports any of the victims in the crash had been engaged in
negotiations to secure their freedom.
   A little more than two weeks before the crash, a caller
identifying himself with the radical Palestinian Abu Nidal group
telephoned a warning to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki that a Pan Am
passenger jet bound from Frankfurt, West Germany, to New York via
London would be attacked.
   The State Department said Thursday it sent out a security alert.
Still, some U.S. officials complained privately that insufficient
precautions were taken and that servicemen traveling home for the
holidays had not been informed.
   After the crash, several callers to news organizations claimed
their groups were responsible for the attack.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut operates on a scaled-down basis
because of the intermittent strife in the country among rival
groups. It is not unusual for the U.S. government to assign a CIA
official to such a sensitive post.
   CIA agents in the past have been the targets of extremists. In an
effort to shield them, the State Department in 1975 ceased
publishing the names of employees at U.S. embassies.
   The State Department said on Friday that three of its employees
were aboard, two stationed in Beirut and the third at the U.S.
Embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   President-elect Bush declined to comment on the situation. ``I
know nothing about it,'' he said in a question-and-answer session
with reporters outside his residence.
   Asked if either of the two officials in Beirut had worked for the
CIA, Ms. McCarty said ``We did not identify them further. Even if I
had such information, we would not release it.''
   U.S. intelligence officers abroad usually adopt ``cover''
positions as diplomats.
   The two in Beirut were Matthew K. Gannon of Orange, Calif., and
Ronald Lariviere of Holyoke, Mass., the State Department said.
   Gannon was assigned to the Near East bureau, and was returning
home after completing an assignment in Beirut as a political
officer. He had previously worked in North Yemen, Jordan and Syria.
   Lariviere, of Holyoke, Mass., had been working in Beirut as a
security officer, while Daniel E. O'Connor of Boston had a similar
job in Nicosia, the department said.
   CIA officials did not return repeated telephone queries.

   They sliced prices to trim hair at the Drake
Barbershop, a place some say is a real cut above.
   With a barbershop quartet harmonizing ``Easy Street'' and
champagne chilling nearby, Rick Merchant was cutting the customer's
hair for the 1920s prices of 35 cents on Christmas Eve.
   ``It's our way to commemorate the anniversary of the Drake Hotel
and the barbershop,'' Merchant said.
   His small but classy barbershop, with its mirrors trimmed with
gold paint and his barbers in white jackets and ties, is located in
the arcade under the venerable, upper-crust hotel on this city's
Magnificant Mile.
   Merchant's shop charged the rates when the barbershop and hotel
opened in 1920 _ 35 cents for a haircut, 25 cents for a manicure and
10 cents for a shoeshine.
   ``It's back to the days when a gentleman could get a haircut, a
shave, manicure _ the works for under a buck,'' said Merchant. ``I
found out the original prices from a 102-year-old man whose hair I
cut. He used to come here in the 1920s.''
   That's quite a contrast to today's Drake Barbershop, where a
haircut costs $16 and a manicure goes for $12.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newly active volcano in northern Japan erupted
again Saturday night and early Sunday, forcing about 250 residents
and tourists to evacuate from nearby ski areas and hot spring
resorts, police said.
   Police officials said no casualties or damage were reported in
the eruption of 6,900-foot Mount Tokachi, about 560 miles north of
Tokyo.
   The volcano first erupted Monday for the first time in 26 years,
sending columns of smoke rising more than a mile high and pouring
mud down its slopes.
   Local town officials said the volcano remained relatively calm
until its eruptions Saturday.
   The mud flow caused by the latest eruptions was reported
subsiding Sunday morning, police said.
   However, the Asahikawa Weather Observation Station warned local
residents Sunday that the volcano could erupt again.
   In 1926, heat from Mount Tokachi's eruption melted almost all
snow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people and
injured another 200 in two nearby villages.
   A smaller eruption in 1962 killed four people.

<HEAD>South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson Injured In Snowmobile Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIERRE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Mickelson was thrown off a
snowmobile Saturday when he dropped into a 10-foot-deep ravine, and
he was hospitalized in serious condition, officials said.
   Mickelson, 47, suffered a broken collarbone and four broken ribs
when his snowmobile dropped into a ravine and he was thrown off,
press aide Gretchen Lord Anderson said.
   ``There's a bruise on his lung, but it's not punctured. He's in
some pain and he will be,'' Anderson said.
   She said the governor's physician, Dr. Tom Huber, determined that
the injuries are not life-threatening and that Mickelson did not
suffer head injuries or lose consciousness. Although Mickelson was
listed in serious condition, his doctor expects him to improve,
Anderson said.
   The first-term Republican governor, who spent several days in the
hospital in late October for a blood clot in his right leg, was
admitted to the special care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Pierre.
   Mickelson was snowmobiling with his son and daughter on the Fort
Pierre National Grasslands south of here when the accident happened
Saturday afternoon.
   The governor's snowmobile dropped an estimated 10 feet into the
ravine. ``The snowmobile stayed upright. The governor was thrown off
onto his shoulder and right side,'' Anderson said.
   Mickelson was wearing a helmet at the time, Anderson said,
adding, ``In fact, when they left town they had forgotten it, and
the governor said they had to go back because he wouldn't ride
without one.''
   Mickelson's daughter Amy, a college sophomore, called for an
ambulance using a radio in the governor's truck.
   Huber didn't know how long the governor would be hospitalized,
Anderson said.

<HEAD>Tornadoes Strike Nashville Area; Snow in West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow hit the mountains in the West on Christmas Eve,
creating hazardous avalanche conditions in Utah; California was
drenched with rain that flooded streets; and in the East,
thunderstorms spawned tornadoes in Tennessee.
   Tornadoes killed one person near Nashville, Tenn., on Saturday.
The thunderstorms were associated with a cold front that extended
from Ohio to Louisiana.
   Elsewhere, a major winter storm moved through much of the West
and was forecast to continue Christmas Day. Winter storm warnings
for heavy snow were posted for most of the mountains west of the
Rockies.
   In northern California, snow fell down to the valley floor in
portions of the Sacramento Valley. Redding, which normally gets
about 3 inches of snow all winter, received 10 inches from Friday
night until midday Saturday.
   Four inches of rain fell in the mountains near San Simeon,
Calif., with 2 inches in San Luis Obispo, where street and highway
flooding was reported. The storm also whipped up winds to 55 mph at
Half Moon Bay, on the central California coast.
   Up to 2 feet of snow was expected in the mountains in northern
Nevada, in southern Idaho and in parts of Utah, where increased
avalanche hazards were forecast.
   Portions of the Midwest and Northeast also had a taste of winter
weather. An inch of snow fell in eastern Iowa, northwestern Illinois
and parts of Wisconsin early Saturday.
   Freezing rain coated portions of central and western New York on
Saturday morning, and snow, sleet and freezing rain moved into
southern portions of Vermont and New Hampshire on Saturday afternoon.
   But the middle and south Atlantic coastal states had moderate
weather with Christmas Eve temperatures in the 60s and 70s from
Virginia to Florida. Richmond, Va., basked in record-setting warmth,
with the temperature of 71 besting the 1931 high for the date by one
degree.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., and Warroad, Minn., to 84 degrees at
Fort Myers, Fla.
   The forecast for Christmas Day called for snow from the northern
high Plains across the Rockies and intermountain West to portions of
the Pacific Northwest; rain along the Washington and Oregon coast,
and across much of California to southern Arizona; and scattered
snow through Michigan, the eastern Great Lakes and the northern
Appalachians.
   High temperatures in the single digits were forecast through most
of Montana, and portions of North Dakota and Minnesota; in the teens
and 20s from the intermountain West across the northern Rockies, the
northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley to northern Michigan;
in the 50s and 60s from the middle and south Atlantic coastal states
across the Tennessee Valley and Gulf states, the southern Plains,
southern New Mexico and the desert Southwest to California; in the
70s in much of Florida and extreme southern Texas; and in the 30s
and 40s in most of the rest of the nation.

   President Reagan telephoned Christmas
greetings to members of the armed forces serving abroad Saturday and
lamented the crash of a Pan Am jumbo jet in Scotland as ``a tragedy
words can hardly describe.''
   The president, who is vacationing at the home where he and first
lady Nancy Reagan will live after he leaves office Jan. 20, also
received thanks from an official in Lockerbie, Scotland, for his
expression of condolence to people in the community where the plane
crashed.
   ``On behalf of the people of Lockerbie I think you and the first
lady for your kind wishes at this time of sorrow,'' Francis Park,
the convenor of the Annandale and Eskdale District Council, wrote to
the president. ``Our small community has suffered much, but our
sadness is even greater when we think of the loss of so many people
from the United States. Our thoughts are with their friends and
relatives wherever they may be.''
   One of the servicemen Reagan called, Petty Officer 1st Class Marc
Redshaw, boatswain's mate on a Coast Guard patrol boat based in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, is an English-born naturalized American.
   ``I noticed you were born in England and both countries this
weekend are saddened by a tragedy words can hardly describe,''
Reagan told Redshaw. ``The sorrow and loss for so many weighs on our
hearts and I can only pray that the spirit of peace which is
Christmas will find its way to comfort all of us.''
   Reagan also telephoned Specialist Christopher M. Skezas of
Bonita, Calif., a soldier on duty with the Multinational Force and
Observer Detachment in Egypt's Sinai Desert; Airman 1st Class
Richard E. Green of Washington, a food service specialist at Shemya
Air Force Base, Alaska; and Lance Cpl. Jeffery D. Tidey of Trenton,
N.J., a Marine Corps radio operator on duty in Panama. He planned to
call a Navy seaman in the Far East later in the day.
   Later, when it was a more convenient hour in the Far East, the
president telephoned Christmas greetings to Seaman Stephen L.
Blocker, of Vincennes, Ind., a sailor in charge of the ward room
mess on the U.S.S. Oldendorf, based out of Yokosuka, Japan.
   He told all of the servicemen, ``We deeply appreciate your
service. It's a sacrifice we recognize _ especially to be away from
home at Christmas. Please tell your fellow soliders we are thinking
of them. Our Christmases are brighter and better because of what
you're doing on the frontiers of freedom, making it safer for
everyone here at home. God bless you. Carry on.''
   Earlier, the president extended special Christmas remembrances to
homeless children in America and to victims of the earthquake in
Soviet Armenia.
   Although the president's talk was taped on Thursday, after the
Pan-American jumbo jet crash in Scotland, he made no mention in his
broadcast of the crash, which killed all 258 passengers and crew and
a score of others on the ground.
   Leslye Arsht, deputy White House press secretary, said the crash
was ``very much of the president's mind'' but he did not mention it
in the speech because it was taped within 24 hours of the accident
as events were still unfolding.
   In a statement at the White House on Friday, just before he left
for a two-week California vacation, the president expressed ``our
sorrow and our concern for the families and friends of those who
died in the crash of the Pan American Flight 103.''
   In his radio speech, the president said ``here in our country,
there are children _ without homes, suffering from dire diseases _
whose Christmases will be makeshift at best.''
   He praised the efforts of Toys for Tots and other organizations
to provide gifts and other assistance for such children.
   Ms. Arsht was asked if the remark was an attempt to soften the
impact of an ABC television interview, taped Wednesday and broadcast
Thursday night, in which the president said that some homeless
people sleep on the grass and on grates by ``their own choice''
instead of going to shelters.
   ``No,'' she said.
   Speaking of the Armenian earthquake, Reagan said, ``We have been
witness to the breathtaking bravery of the people of Leninakan and
Spitak as they ready themselves for the task of going on.''
   He also said that at such a time, ``Closed borders open. Friends
and enemies alike share the burden and hope to help. From Israel and
war-torn Lebanon alike, supplies and aid have been sent to Soviet
Armenia. And from the United States the response has been
staggering.''
   The White House said the president's son, Michael, his wife,
Colleen, and their two children were visiting the president and
first lady Nancy Reagan at their new home here Saturday.
   The Reagans were having a traditional Christmas eve dinner at the
home of Charles Z. Wick, the outgoing director of the U.S.
Information Agency, and his wife.
   On Sunday, they plan a Christmas dinner at home, with the
president's daughter, Maureen; her husband, Dennis Revell; the
Reagans' son, Ron; and his wife, Doria.
   Mrs. Reagan has said that she and her husband were giving each
other items for the house as gifts.

   Rep. Elton Gallegly got the chance to
be a traffic cop when he chased down a motorcyclist who sideswiped
his new car, then held the man until police arrived.
   Roy Kinman, 43, of Moorpark was arrested for investigation of
driving under the influence of alcohol and hit-and-run driving,
police said.
   Gallegly, R-Calif., said he was waiting at a traffic light Friday
afternoon when his 1989 Mercury Cougar was hit by the cycle.
   ``He clipped the front part of my car,'' Gallegly said. ``He was
skidding in between three or four cars at the signal. I laid on my
horn and took off after him. I picked up the car phone and called
the police.''
   Gallegly said he gave chase until the cyclist became stuck in
traffic and finally pulled over.
   ``I told him, `You hit my car.' He said, `I didn't think I hit it
that hard,''' Gallegly said.
   Gallegly, a former Simi Valley mayor, had returned to this city
for the holidays while Congress is in recess.

   The spirit of Christmas made a comeback in Peking and Soweto,
while Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth II of Britain invoked
the holiday to denounce the evil of modern times and comfort those
afflicted by recent catastrophes.
   President Reagan telephoned Christmas greetings to members of the
armed forces in distant places Saturday, talking to several selected
servicemen from Egypt to the Far East.
   In China, increasing numbers of foreign tourists and more
exposure to foreign books and television has helped foster what one
Beijing newspaper called ``Christmas fever.''
   Hotels for foreigners mounted Christmas displays and people
bought up Christmas cards imported from Hong Kong. In their latest
fad, Chinese university students raised on atheism went
church-hopping Christmas Eve, and thousands of them jammed Beijing's
main Protestant and Catholic churches Saturday night.
   In the black township of Soweto, South Africa, people prepared to
enjoy a day clouded in recent years by black activists' calls for
``Black Christmas'' boycotts to protest the white minority
government.
   This year no boycotts were announced and people bought toys, sent
Christmas cards, and filled holiday shopping bags without fear of
reprisals for breaking a boycott.
   In Vatican City at St. Peter's Basilica, the pope heralded the
birth of Christ and lamented the ``evil which still persists in
human history and even, in a sense, is becoming deeper and more
widespread.''
   In parts of the world riven by recent disasters, the holiday
supplied only a bare glimmer of hope.
   In Lockerbie, Scotland, where Pan American World Airways Flight
103 crashed Wednesday and killed all 258 board as well as others on
the ground, shops remained open and churches held Christmas Eve
services.
   Yet hearts grieved as searchers combed the countryside for more
bodies. The Rev. Patrick Keegans, whose home was destroyed in the
crash, put Christmas preparations aside Saturday to meet with
relatives of victims at a counseling center in the Roman Catholic
parish hall.
   In Soviet Armenia, where a Dec. 7 earthquake killed an estimated
55,000 people, a teacher said even the holiday season could do
little to provide solace.
   ``For us Armenians, there can be no holidays this year. No New
Year's, no Christmas,'' said Edik Kasparyan, a Leninakan teacher.
``There has been too much loss, too much death.''
   In London, Queen Elizabeth broadcast an unprecedented second
Christmas message Saturday to comfort those who suffered in the Pan
Am jet disaster, the Armenian earthquake and a recent rail crash in
south London that killed 34 people.
   She said she wanted to offer her heartfelt sympathy and prayers
to those who were injured and lost loved ones in the three disasters
which ``shocked and distressed'' the entire world.
   Elsewhere, Christmas competed with social strife.
   In the occupied West Bank town of Bethlehem, where Jesus is said
to have been born, Israeli soldiers seemed to outnumber celebrants
Saturday. A driving rain, a Palestinian general strike and heavy
Israeli security kept crowds slim. In Beirut, Lebanon, friends and
relatives of American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland
and British captive John McCarthy hoped the season would soften the
hearts of the kidnappers. They appealed for the release of the
hostages in Christmas letters published Saturday in Beirut
newspapers.
   Despite social turmoil, terror, and disasters both manmade and
natural, millions of children around the world felt the magic of
Christmas with an innocence many of their elders lost long, long ago.
   In a Moscow apartment on Saturday, the eyes of a 5-year-old girl
named Olga lit up when a couple dressed as Ded Moroz and
Snegurochka, Grandfather Frost and a snow maiden, walked in.
   Ded Moroz opened his sack and pulled out a huge teddy bear.
   ``It's so beautiful,'' said Olga, who was herself dressed as a
princess.
   Reagan, in his pretaped radio speech, extended special Christmas
remembrances to homeless children in America and to victims of the
earthquake in Soviet Armenia.
   ``Here in our country, there are children _ without homes,
suffering from dire diseases _ whose Christmases will be makeshift
at best,'' said the president, who is spending the holidays in Los
Angeles with wife Nancy. He praised the efforts of Toys for Tots and
other organizations to provide gifts and other assistance for such
children.
   In the United States, last-minute shoppers thronged shopping
malls and last-minute travelers had most airplanes booked solid.
   At the Ocean County Mall in Toms River, N.J., manager John
DelBene said the mall's 105 stores were packed with shoppers buying
``just one more thing.''
   People were already waiting to get in when the mall opened at 8
a.m., and by noon, the parking lot was full and cars were parked on
the grass, DelBene said.
   ``It gets more hectic every year, as merchants try to beat the
prior year's figures. The trend seems to be to wait till the end,''
DelBene said.

   A Navy machinist's mate who missed Pan Am
Flight 103 because he could not find the airline ticket counter at
London's Heathrow Airport arrived home Saturday to the joy of his
mother.
   Robert Richardson, 20, of Ironton said he planned to be aboard
the London to New York flight, which crashed Wednesday in Lockerbie,
Scotland, killing all 258 people aboard and leaving at least 10
people on the ground missing.
   But he and a friend missed Flight 103, for which they had
reservations, because they could not find the Pan Am ticket counter
at Heathrow. They took a TWA flight that left for New York 15
minutes later, before the crash of the Boeing 747 over Scotland
about an hour into the flight.
   Richardson and his wife, Kristy, drove all night from Norfolk,
Va., and arrived in Ironton about 8 a.m. Saturday.
   For six hours Wednesday, Richardson's mother, Jackie Richardson,
tried to contact Pan Am in New York to inquire about her son. She
had telephoned her daughter-in-law, who was recovering from a
miscarriage in a Norfolk hospital, and told her that Richardson's
plane was bound from London to New York.
   ``I told her the time it was supposed to come into New York and
she started screaming that the plane had crashed,'' Jackie
Richardson said.
   Kristy Richardson said she was relieved to finally hear from her
husband.
   ``I spent six or seven hours crying and in hysterics,'' she told
the Ironton Tribune. ``Everyone told me, `Think the best, think the
best.' But it's kind of hard. He called me that night and I was just
overwhelmed. I started crying again on the phone.''
   Richardson's mother said she finally reached a Pan Am official
about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday. The official said her son's name was not
on the passenger list.
   ``But you don't know for sure until you hear that voice on the
phone,'' she said.
   At 12:30 a.m., Robert called his mother in Ironton.
   ``He said `Mom,' and we both just bawled. He said, `Mom, I was
supposed to be on that plane,''' she said.
   Richardson, who is stationed on the aircraft carrier USS John F.
Kennedy, said he learned of the crash while waiting for his luggage
at Kennedy Airport in New York.
   ``A woman came up and grabbed my arm and said, `Have you seen my
baby? Have you seen my baby?' I had to tell her no, I hadn't,'' he
said. ``It was very quiet at the airport. All you heard was crying.
Nobody was talking.''

   Pope John Paul II heralded the birth of Jesus
Christ in a midnight Mass homily for Roman Catholics worldwide
Saturday, and state-run Italian television said the message was
being broadcast to the Soviet Union for the first time.
   The pope, dressed in gold and white robes and carrying a
crucifix, walked into St. Peter's Basilica moments before midnight
at the end of a long cortege of priests. At the same time, church
bells chimed all over Rome to hail the arrival of Christmas.
   The pope opened the homily in St. Peter's Basilica by quoting
from Luke 2:10-11, ``I bring you good news of great joy for to you
is born a savior.'' A text of the homily was issued in advance by
the Vatican.
   ``We hear this voice which emanates from the depths of the night
of Bethlehem. The shepherds `keeping watch over their flock by
night' were the first to hear it. For this reason, the midnight
liturgy is sometimes called `the Shepherds' Mass,'' he said.
   John Paul, speaking from the papal altar under the colossal
bronze canopy designed by Bernini, noted that people of different
languages were listening to the same message on radio and television
broadcasts of the Mass to 50 countries.
   The pope, seated on a white and gold throne in front of the
altar, spoke to a congregation that included cardinals in red
vestments, formally dressed diplomats accredited to the Vatican, and
thousands of pilgrims.
   An announcer on the state-run RAI television network, which was
feeding the Mass to other stations and networks around the world,
said the message was being broadcast to the Soviet Union for the
first time. He did not elaborate.
   The Soviet Union has shown signs of overtures to the Roman
Catholic church and its domestic faithful in recent months. Earlier
this year, officials allowed celebrations to mark the 1,000
anniversary of Russian Christendom and received a delegation from
the Vatican.
   Last year the Soviets stopped jamming the Voice of America, a
radio station operated by the U.S. government. On Nov. 29, they
stopped interfering with signals of U.S.-funded Radio Liberty.
   In his midnight Mass, the pope cautioned the faithful not to be
complacent, and to find the true meaning of Christmas in the words
``a savior is born to you.''
   ``It may seem that people have achieved a great deal, and
continue to do so, in `saving' themselves with their own resources,
so that they be self-sufficient. But they are becoming more and more
convinced that they are not self-sufficient, that all the things
that are termed `civilization, progress and development' do not
reach the roots of the evil which still persists in human history
and even, in a sense, is becoming deeper and more widespread,'' the
pope said.
   ``Meanwhile the words `a savior is born to you' continue to touch
what is permanent and real in man, what is profoundly true,'' the
pontiff said.
   On Sunday, the pope was to lead a 10:30 a.m. Christmas Day Mass
in St. Peter's, the largest church in Christendom.
   That Mass is followed by the pope's traditional Christmas Day
message ``Urbi et Orbi,'' to the city and to the world.
   Earlier Saturday, in what has become a Christmas Eve custom, the
pope met with fellow Poles for the breaking of the oplatek,
paper-thin unleavened bread similar to wafers used for Communion.
   Polish families usually begin Christmas Eve dinner by passing the
wafer around the table.
   During the meeting with his countrymen, John Paul, speaking in
Polish, severely criticized what he called ``the evil traditions of
the last decades'' in Polish politics.

<TEXT>
   At least seven Christmas Eve slayings pushed the
1988 homicide total to a record with a week left in the year still
to go, officials said Saturday.
   The seven slayings reported by early evening Saturday raised the
citywide total for 1988 to 1,842, breaking the record 1981 total of
1,841, said police spokesman Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   On an average day in New York City, five people are murdered.
City officials, both police and elected, have repeatedly blamed
drugs and particularly crack for the rise in violence.
   In all of 1945, the Police Department reported 291 homicides; in
August 1988 alone, there were 201. Since the crack explosion in
1985, homicides have steadily increased: 1,385 in 1985, 1,582 in
1986, and 1,672 last year.
   As of last month, Assistant Police Chief Raymond Kelly said about
42 percent of this year's slayings were drug-related.
   ``These tragic statistics reflect the mayor's concern expressed
over the past 4{ years that the federal government ought to do
something about drugs flooding across our border,'' said mayoral
spokesman Lee Jones.
   The Christmas Eve slayings included a 40-year-old man stabbed to
death in his East Village apartment; an unidentified man shot once
over the eye in drug-plagued Washington Heights; a 21-year-old man
fatally shot after a dispute in a Manhattan nightclub; and a
36-year-old woman found stabbed to death in her Brooklyn apartment.
   On Friday, shoppers at a Brooklyn department store were sent
diving for cover during a shootout between teen-agers that left one
dead and three wounded. The gunfight was ignited when one teen-ager
bumped another inside the store.
   The problem is not limited to New York; in Washington, there has
already been a record set for the most homicides ever in a year. New
York ranks 10th in killings per 100,000 people, said Kelly. The top
three are Detroit, Washington and New Orleans, he said.

   Police stormed a prison and crushed an
uprising by inmates who were denied Christmas pardons, but the
warden and 23 other people were killed and six were injured in the
two-day siege, officials said Saturday.
   ``There was a fierce gunfight lasting about 15 minutes before the
special forces could quell the mutiny'' on Friday night, said police
officer Sergio Anzaldo, who was on duty when the commandos attacked
the prison.
   ``It was quite violent,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Authorities have arrested four inmates and three prison guards
suspected of complicity in the uprising, a state government
spokesman said Saturday.
   One of the arrested guards, hospitalized with minor wounds, was
earlier considered one of 20 hostages rescued Friday night when
police stormed the prison's administrative offices and crushed the
uprising, said Francisco Flores, a spokesman for Nayarit state
government.
   The other two guards were not there during the uprising, but they
may have allowed inmates and two outsiders into the office area
Thursday morning, the state official said.
   Anzaldo said 130 commandos flown in from Mexico City stormed the
prison after a group of inmates had held 14 prison employees and
visiting relatives hostage for 32 hours. An earlier attempt to storm
the prison Friday was repulsed.
   The uprising began Thursday after the mutinous prisoners were
denied pardons given at Christmas to inmates with good behavior.
   Flores said a preliminary report showed the mutiny began when
about six inmates arrived at the warden's office Thursday to protest
denial of the pardons.
   Two well-dressed visitors posing as lawyers approached the
building at the same time and took out guns. Flores said they had
entered the prison without being searched.
   The hostages were held in administrative offices, and the rest of
the 1,200 inmates remained under control throughout the uprising on
the outskirts of Tepic, the Nayarit state capital, 500 miles
northwest of Mexico City.
   The death toll from the original confrontation Thursday morning
and the raids Friday night was 24: Samuel Alvarado, the 31-year-old
warden of Venustiano Carranza penitentiary; Jorge Armando Duarte,
head of the Fox commando unit; 19 prisoners and three unidentified
people presumed to be prisoners, Flores said.
   Alvarado was killed in a shootout when the inmates tried to seize
the warden's office Thursday, officials said. He was reported to
have bled to death from a leg wound.
   Authorities were still trying to determine exactly how many
inmates were ultimately involved in the uprising and how the
firearms were brought into the prison.
   Celso Humberto Delgado Ramirez, governor of the state of Nayarit,
told reporters Saturday that the immediate deployment of 200 state
police had kept hundreds of visiting relatives and officials from
being trapped by the uprising, but some relatives were among the
hostages.
   Anzaldo said Red Cross volunteers recovered the bodies after the
assault and were not immediately sure about their identities. A
prisoner provided initial identifications.
   Duarte was shot shortly before nightfall Friday, when he went
into the prison compound and tried to talk the inmates into
surrendering. ``The answer was a hail of bullets which killed him
instantly,'' a state official said.
   About two hours later, police lobbed dozens of tear gas canisters
into the penitentiary and rushed it with automatic weapons blazing.
An undetermined number of people died in the raid, which was
unsuccessful.
   About 11 p.m. Friday the commandos staged a second raid, which
killed more people and succeeded, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   At least two people besides the prison warden and commando leader
were killed before special forces stormed the inmates, he said.
   Anzaldo said the prison's security force had been doubled and
reinforced with special police.

<HEAD>Business `Booming' as Drawing for Illinois' Third-Largest Lotto
Prize Nears</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `Lottery officials...', with winning numbers.
No announcement of whether there is a winner expected until Sunday.</NOTE>

   Lottery players had visions of dollar signs
dancing in their heads on Christmas Eve and kept machines across the
state humming late Saturday, including one spot that has become
something of a lottery shrine.
   The Liquor Rack, in the southeastern town of Robinson, has earned
its reputation as a lucky lottery outlet after selling winning
tickets four times. With an estimated $37 million grand prize on the
line Saturday, the third largest ever offered in Illinois, many
lottery players made a special pilgrimage to the store.
   The winning numbers picked Saturday evening were 8, 9, 27, 33, 43
and 54. Lottery officials said they won't announce whether anyone
matched all six numbers until Sunday. And because of the holiday,
the validation of winners, if there are any, will wait until Tuesday.
   ``They're hanging out the door,'' said Gene Wilkin, owner of The
Liquor Rack. ``We can't give the thing (machine) a break.''
   The business that sells the winning ticket receives a bonus equal
to 1 percent of the winnings. Of Wilkin's four bonuses, the last two
came only a month apart, in July and August.
   ``Everybody on the road stops to see us,'' said Wilkin. ``We had
a few people come down from Champaign (100 miles away) just to pick
up their tickets.''
   State lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem wasn't surprised. With
average sales of 1 million tickets an hour since early Saturday
morning, she said most ticket outlets were likely very busy.
   ``We weren't sure how we'd do on Christmas Eve, but I guess the
public has answered that question,'' she said. ``Business is
booming.''
   The $37 million prize is the result of three previous weekend
drawings without any player matching all six numbers drawn from
among 54 possible. While the state lottery guarantees $5 million for
each weekend drawing and rolls that amount over, the big increases
come when there are more than the usual number of tickets sold.
   Business also was brisk at Doc's Liquor Store, the northwest
Chicago suburban shop owned by Mike Wittkowski, the one-time printer
who won the largest-ever prize of $40 million four years ago.
   ``Mike still plays, but I don't know whether he's playing this
one or not It seems like everybody else is though,'' said Dino
Pappas, Wittkowski's brother-in-law and the manager of the store.
``Sales are big. Real big.''
   The second-largest Illinois prize of $39 million was claimed Nov.
5 by former state Rep. James Soper of Cicero.
   Ms. Rem said there has also been a $35 million jackpot, but that
was shared by several winners.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian terrorist group said
Saturday it will free two French girls held hostage for more than a
year, in response to an appeal by Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi
that captives be released.
   A statement issued by the Fatah Revolutionary Council, led by Abu
Nidal, said the girls to be released are the daughters of French
hostage Jacqueline Valente. They are Marie-Laure, 7, and Virginie, 6.
   The council's statement also called for release of all kidnapped
hostages in Lebanon, ``especially those uninvolved in any espionage
activity or those serving with humanitarian organizations.''
   The group's announcement was released a few hours after Ms.
Valente's mother, former husband and brother-in-law arrived in west
Beirut from Paris to press for their relatives' freedom.
   The statement set no date for their release. But the group's
spokesman, Walid Khaled, told The Associated Press the two girls
were to be freed within 24 hours.
   Khaled said in November last year that his group captured the
three, along with five Belgians, from a French boat it seized off
the coast of the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. He accused the adults
of being Israeli spies, which their relatives deny.
   ``In light of the appeal made by brother Moammar Gadhafi on the
occasion of Christmas and New Year for the release of the hostages,
especially the two girls, Marie-Laure and Virginie, our Central
Committee has decided to free the two girls within the framework of
specific security arrangements set for this purpose,'' the statement
said.
   In April, the group offered to release Ms. Valente's older
daughters, but Khaled said their mother refused to let them go.
   The statement, released in Beirut, did not spell out the security
arrangements involved, nor did it indicate the captives'
whereabouts. But it said Libya pledged to ``extend all the necessary
facilities that will guarantee the safety of the two girls.''
   The captives are widely believed held in the Palestinian refugee
camp of Ein el-Hilweh outside the southern port of Sidon.
   Ms. Valente's brother-in-law, Andre Metral, said after the
statement was released that Khaled contacted him at the Cavalier
Hotel in west Beirut and told him he wanted to see him, without
setting an exact date for the meeting.
   But Metral said the meeting would most probably take place
sometime Sunday and that Khaled had warned him that he does not want
any reporters present.
   Ms. Valente, her daughters and the five Belgians have been called
the ``forgotten hostages'' by the French media, since they are not
among 15 foreign hostages most commonly mentioned in press reports.
Ms. Valente gave birth to a third daughter in captivity and is
reportedly expecting a fourth child.
   The French and Belgians have been held for more than a year by
Fatah Revolutionary Council, a radical guerrilla group led by
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal. The Belgians being held are
Emmanuel Houtekins, his wife, Godelieve, their two children,
Valerie, 16, and Laurent, 17, and Emmanuel's brother, Fernand.
   Abu Nidal, also known as Sabry Banna, is widely believed to have
organized the December 1985 attacks at the Rome and Vienna airports
in which 16 people were killed. A former official of Fatah, a
faction led by PLO chief Yasser Arafat, Abu Nidal split with the PLO
in the early 1970s. The Fatah Revolutionary Council is not part of
the PLO.
   The statement's call for release of hostages doing humanitarian
work or those not involved in espionage appeared to refer to Belgian
doctor Jan Cools, 32, who disappeared May 21 after leaving his
apartment in the Rashidiyeh Palestinian refugee camp near Lebanon's
southern port of Tyre.
   Cools worked for the Norwegian Norwac humanitarian organization
for three months before he vanished. A previously unknown group
calling itself ``The Soldiers of Justice'' claimed responsibility
for his abduction Dec. 18.
   With the statement, the Abu Nidal group was apparently trying to
distance itself from the death threats that led the International
Committee of the Red Cross to suspend services and evacuate all
Swiss personnel from Lebanon this week. One of its workers was
recently kidnapped in Sidon and then released.
   Also Saturday, friends and relatives of American hostages Terry
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland and British captive John McCarthy
appealed for their release in Christmas letters published in Beirut
newspapers.
   The U.S.-based Journalists' Committee to Free Terry Anderson
called on pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists to free him and
Sutherland ``in the name of humanity.''
   The two Americans are among 15 Westerners missing in Lebanon.
Anderson and Sutherland are believed held by a pro-Iranian Shiite
group known as the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.
   Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held of the hostages. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Scottish-born Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., was acting
dean of agriculture at the American University in Beirut when gunmen
seized him June 9, 1985.
   McCarthy, 32, of London, a producer for the London-based
Worldwide Television News, disappeared April 17, 1986. No group has
claimed to have kidnapped him.

   No bones about it, Josephine Mattson's
Christmas tree, covered from tip to trunk with 525 gold-painted
wishbones, is one of a kind.
   ``It's different,'' said Mattson, a retired occupational
therapist. ``People seem to enjoy it. They've never heard of a
wishbone tree.''
   Mattson's wishbones are no paltry poultry collection, either.
Although it includes the usual chicken and turkey bones, it also has
fragile pheasant, quail and pigeon wishbones, tiny as thimbles. One
comes from a golden eagle, she said.
   Some date back decades, including the wishbone from the eagle,
which was handed down from a friend's grandfather. The golden eagles
are now protected from hunters.
   The collection started when Mattson's father established a
poultry farm in the 1930s. Her mother kept chicken, turkey, geese
and duck wishbones from family dinners on a shelf in the family
kitchen.
   The collection took off from there, said Mattson. After a Denver
newspaper reported on the tree some 30 years ago, Mattson was
showered with wishbones from well-wishers.
   The tree is topped by a big turkey wishbone turned upside down
with a bell suspended from the prongs.
   Mattson says the turkey wishbone from this year's Christmas
dinner will hang to one side of the golden eagle wishbone, making a
wish for a happy new year.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carols filtered through
loudspeakers and drifted across Manger Square, but few Christmas Eve
pilgrims were on hand to hear them in this biblical town, where
soldiers seemed to outnumber celebrants.
   A driving rain, a Palestinian general strike and heavy Israeli
security kept crowds slim. As darkness fell, troops with automatic
rifles stood guard on rooftops, including that of the Church of the
Nativity, which marks the site where Jesus Christ is said to have
been born.
   The few visitors who spent the afternoon in Bethlehem huddled
under Manger Square's arcade, outside shops closed down by striking
Palestinians.
   In other parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
five Palestinians were reported wounded, one in a clash with troops
and four in a clash with an Arab village official accused of
collaborating with Israel, Arab reports said. Israel radio quoted
security sources as saying a family feud was behind the incident.
   Two Arabs also died and three others were wounded as they
``handled an explosive device'' in the small West bank village of
Marj en Naja, an army spokesman said. The army had no further
details.
   Bethlehem was quiet.
   Arab municipal officials canceled the traditional Christmas
parade in an expression of solidarity with the year-old uprising
against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Slogans written on Bethlehem walls by the uprising's PLO-backed
leadership ordered Palestinians to stay at home.
   But Israeli authorities went ahead with a choir concert before
midnight Mass in St. Catherine's Church. Several hundred tourists
and Christian pilgrims attended the performance, but the number was
a considerable drop from the thousands who normally attend.
   ``Silent Night,'' sung in German and English by the Pueri Youth
Chorus from Geneva opened the concert.
   Also on the program was another Swiss choir, two choirs from
Spain and one from the Shiloh baptist church in Washington, which
sang ``Let My People Go.''
   The choir director, Charles W. Fleming, said the song was chosen
to speak out for freedom from oppression all over the world.
   ``The idea is that people should be free. Christ came to bring us
that freedom,'' he said.
   Official ceremonies began Saturday with the arrival of Michel
Sabbah, the bishop of Jerusalem, in the afternoon.
   Sabbah, the Roman Catholic patriarch of Jerusalem, was greeted in
Manger Square by the Israeli military governor of Bethlehem, Lt.
Col. Shaltiel Levy, and the city's mayor, Elias Freij.
   The visitors and pilgrims who watched the bishop arrive near the
Mosque of Omar were far outnumbered by journalists and hundreds of
Israeli police, troops and plainclothes officers.
   A leaflet issued earlier this week by the PLO-backed underground
leaders of the uprising called for a general strike on Christmas
Eve, and complained of Israeli participation in the Christian
ceremonies.
   But Israeli officials said they felt it was important to maintain
the practice _ more than a century old _ in which rulers of the
region greet church leaders as a symbol of the protection offered to
minority Christians in the largely Moslem Middle East.
   The practice was followed by the British and Turkish rulers of
Palestine.
   Sabbah, who is the first Palestinian appointed bishop of
Jerusalem, was led into the church by traditional Moslem guards
wearing red fezzes and carrying curved swords.
   Hundreds of people crowded into the church to attend after strict
searches by Israeli security guards. More than 100 stood outside in
the rain to watch the mass on a large screen set up on the wall of
the Manger Square police station.
   Holy water was sprinkled at the doorway of the Church of the
Nativity as the bishop, preceded by altar boys, entered amid a clowd
of incense smoke.
   The midnight Mass, led by Sabbah, is held each year in St.
Catherine's basilica next door because the Church of the Nativity,
built over the grotto where Christ was born, is run by the Greek
Orthodox church. The Greek Orthodox celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6,
the Epiphany.
   Israeli troops blocked all streets around Manger Square, and
pilgrims had to walk blocks to reach it. Before they could enter,
they had to pass through metal detectors and were searched by
Israeli security forces.
   Virginia Lankton, of Lansing, Mich., said she did not mind the
heavy security because ``I realize it is for my own safety.''
   She said her husband died recently and she came to the Holy Land
at Christmas to realize a life-long dream.
   ``I was alone and I thought this was a good place to be, instead
of being home alone,'' she said.
   Father Stephen Doyle, a Franciscan priest who is assistant rector
at the nearby ecumenical institute, said he was discouraged by the
deployment of many Israeli soldiers and police around Manger Square.
   ``It's extremely depressing to see something like this the day
before we celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace,'' said the
Philadelphia-born priest.
   There was no violence in heavily-guarded Bethlehem, but in
Nablus, 25 miles north, a 21-year-old Arab man who was shot in the
head by soldiers last week died of his wounds Saturday.
   Doyle said he thought most Arab Christians from the West Bank
would probably not attend midnight Mass because of the heavy
security, but likely would fill the church on Christmas morning.
   About 35,000 Palestinan Christians live in the West Bank and
Gaza, which Israel captured in the the 1967 Middle East war.
   At least 334 Palestinians have been killed during the revolt.
Fourteen Israelis also have been killed.

   Federal drug agents seized 330 pounds of
cocaine Saturday in the latest action against Colombia's notorious
Medellin drug cartel, officials said.
   A 39-year-old Cuban national also was arrested in the raid,
dubbed ``Operation Christmas Cola,'' said Ralph Lochridge, a
spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. He estimated
the shipment was worth $5 million.
   ``During the holiday season, drug traffickers attempt to evade
detection from law enforcement officials by moving large quantities
of drugs based on their belief that during the Christmas season
there are fewer agents on duty to catch them,'' Lochridge said.
   ``Not so for this smuggling operation. It was definitely a white
Christmas for the feds.''
   The Cuban national, Jose Thomas Alcorta of Miami, was booked for
investigation of possession of cocaine for distribution and sale,
Lochridge said.
   He was arrested in the city of Commerce, about eight miles
southeast of downtown, after allegedly loading boxes containing the
cocaine into a refrigerated semi-tractor trailer, said Lochridge.
   The seizure was part of a continuing effort by a DEA task force,
Lochridge said. In June, the group seized 660 pounds of cocaine from
alleged members of the Medellin cartel, he said.
   An arraignment for Alcorta was not immediately set.

   A storm-spawned tornado swept through two
of Nashville's southern suburbs just after dawn Saturday, killing
one person, injuring 15 and destroying 20 buildings in a
three-mile-long path.
   As many as eight twisters were reported in the Franklin area
shortly after 6 a.m., according to the Tennessee Emergency
Management Agency, but only one apparently was responsible for the
destruction in Franklin and neighboring Brentwood.
   The tornado, which cut a swath about three miles long by 50 yards
wide, destroyed 15 houses and damaged 40 others, and five commercial
buildings were toppled and six more damaged, said Danny Newton, the
agency's chief of operations.
   Damage to residences not including the belongings inside was
estimated at $3 million, said Mike Thompson, emergency management
director for Williamson County.
   ``I'm glad that you're talking to me instead of writing my
obituary,'' said Hardy Britton, whose wife suffered only minor
injuries after she was sucked through a shattered window of their
frame house and hurled at least 20 or 30 yards into an open field.
   Not a single piece of furniture remained intact in Britton's
home, but he and his two daughters were uninjured.
   The threat of tornadoes moved eastward with the passage of a line
of intense thunderstorms, leaving residents to face Christmas with
ruined homes and cars and streets littered with torn-apart trees and
shards of wood, metal and insulation.
   A number of planes at the local airport also were destroyed, said
Lt. Jim Harper of the Franklin Fire Department.
   Ernest Rice, 67, was dead on arrival at Williamson Medical
Center, 20 miles south of Nashville, where 15 people injured in the
storm were taken, said nursing supervisor Arvemia Wilburn. All were
treated and released except one, Lucy McClearon of College Grove,
who was listed in stable condition, she said.
   Most residents were sleeping or just waking up when the storm
hit. ``All I know is I got up and got myself a cup of coffee,''
Britton said. ``I heard two fast whistles (of wind) and that was it.
I was blown off my feet.''
   Britton's neighbor, Betty White, said, ``It was just like a train
going through the house, a lot of wind and it was whistling real
loud and glass was flying everywhere.''
   Mrs. White's brick frame home was heavily damaged, but she, her
husband and their two sons were unhurt.

<HEAD>Judge Penalizes Maddox for Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyer Alton Maddox Jr. said Saturday he would
appeal a $1,000 fine imposed on him for filing a baseless complaint
of racism in the state's court system.
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey found in July that Maddox's
complaint had no basis. In a ruling released Friday by the state, he
denied a request by Maddox, who represented controversial teen-ager
Tawana Brawley, to reconsider the fine and ordered the penalty.
   Maddox, who is black, complained in the suit that he had to apply
for permission to represent an indigent defendant while a white
lawyer received such an appointment without applying first. The
state presented evidence that the white lawyer had to apply as well,
Mukasey said.
   The judge, who noted that the state panel that disciplines
lawyers was reviewing the case, ordered Maddox to pay the state
legal costs of $1,000.
   Maddox charged Saturday that the judge also was biased against
him. He said Mukasey once was a law partner with now-U.S. Attorney
Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom Maddox said ``has absolute hatred of
myself.''
   ``The only rationale that anybody can apply to this ruling is
that this judge is obviously biased because of his relationship with
Rudy Giuliani,'' Maddox said.
   The courthouse was closed Saturday and Mukasey could not be
reached for comment.
   Ms. Brawley, who is black, touched off a nationwide controversy
after claiming she had been abducted and sexually assaulted for
several days by up to six white men, including one who flashed a
police badge.
   She and her family, however, refused to cooperate with state
investigators on the advice of Maddox, another lawyer, C. Vernon
Mason, and the Rev. Al Sharpton. A state grand jury concluded that
Ms. Brawley concocted her story.

   A barge that lost 70,000 gallons of
oil off the southwestern Washington coast was towed into port
Saturday after a leak was plugged, while volunteers cleaned up
oil-coated birds left in its wake.
   ``I've heard people mutter `Merry Christmas,' but I don't think
they meant it,'' said Kirk Thomas of the Washington Conservation
Corps, one of those who looked for injured birds on the beach.
   Ron Holcomb of the state Department of Ecology said more than 300
birds were brought in Saturday for cleaning at a rescue station set
up in a church in nearby Hoquiam, but 130 were found dead or could
not be saved. Sixty birds were found dead Friday night, officials
said.
   Crews stopped working late Saturday, but planned to resume
efforts early Sunday morning, Holcomb said. There were encouraging
reports that some of the oil was dissipating in the ocean, he said.
   Holcomb said oil came ashore along a three-mile stretch of ocean
beach on the jetty at the north entrance to Grays Harbor northward
to Ocean Shores. There were reports of oil-covered birds as far
north as Moclips, 15 miles north of here, and a few from south of
the Grays Harbor entrance, said Holcomb.
   He said the birds were open-ocean birds, mostly common murres,
and came ashore only because they were stricken by the spill. There
was no telling how many birds were harmed, he said.
   The barge, loaded with 2.7 million gallons of heavy oil, began
leaking Thursday night after it was struck by the tug towing it.
Just one tank, which held 250,000 gallons, was affected, and the
spill was estimated at 70,000 gallons, officials said.
   An emergency patch could not be placed on the barge until early
Saturday because of rough seas.
   Oil seeped into Grays Harbor and up the northern part of the
inlet as the leaking barge was towed south Friday night to the mouth
of the Columbia River.
   Wildlife Department spokesman Doug Zimmer said that within Grays
Harbor, there were traces of oil at the Oyhut Wildlife Recreation
Area and heavier concentrations on Sand and Goose islands.
   The islands are used as resting spots by harbor seals, but there
was no immediate evidence any seals were harmed.
   Meanwhile, the barge arrived at Astoria, Ore., just inside the
mouth of the Columbia, about midday Saturday, said Coast Guard Lt.
Cmdr. Guy Nolan of Portland, Ore.
   The level of oil and seawater in the damaged compartment was
lowered by pumping to other compartments on the barge, and the
temporary patch in the gashed tank was strengthened, Nolan said.
   Eventually, Nolan said, the barge would be towed to Portland
where it would be drained and a permanent patch installed.
   The barge is owned by Sause Bros. Ocean Towing Inc. of Coos Bay,
Ore., which hired a company to begin cleanup operations, said Dick
Lauer, manager of bulk products for Sause.
   Sause Bros. has operated coastal barges for more than 40 years,
said Lauer. He declined to comment on whether the spill was the
worst in the company's history.

   A father received a Christmas present he
will not soon forget Saturday when he learned his son, first
identified as among the victims of the Pan Am crash in Scotland, is
alive and well.
   ``I feel like a million pounds have been lifted off my
shoulders,'' said John Wittman, of Okmulgee. ``It just feels good.''
   But he said he still grieves for the families who lost someone in
Wednesday's crash over Lockerbie, Scotland. All 258 people aboard
the Boeing 747 died and at least 10 people on the ground were
missing. ``I still feel something for the people who did lose their
kids.''
   Wittman, who is retired from a glass company, said Pan Am
notified him Thursday that his son, Master Sgt. David Lee O'Connor,
stationed in West Germany, was on the ill-fated plane.
   The information apparently came from a listing of ``D.
O'Connor,'' Wittman said. But the actual victim was Daniel E.
O'Connor, 31, of Boston, who was a security agent for the State
Department in Nicosia.
   ``Hell's not the word. If it hadn't been for prayer and the
church I belong to here I couldn't have made it,'' said Wittman,
whose son was renamed O'Connor when Wittman and his first wife
separated.
   ``The other church members have done some hard praying. I feel so
sorry for the other people. My heart goes out to them because I know
what they are feeling.''
   Wittman said he talked to his son in Germany on Saturday and the
relief was so great ``my wife got to feeling better and started
cooking Christmas dinner.''
   ``We didn't even think we were going to have a Christmas, not
knowing whether he was dead or alive,'' Wittman said. ``I did
believe he was dead, but I believe in prayers with all my heart and
my church has been praying, too.''

   Prayers for the dead pushed aside
thoughts of joy at Christmas services in this small community where
a Pan American World Airways jet crashed Wednesday.
   ``It has always been the usage to wish everyone a very merry
Christmas. It would scarcely be appropriate. There can be no
merriment in our hearts at this time,'' Church of Scotland minister
James Annand told the congregation at the midnight services Saturday.
   Grieving townspeople crowded into his Dryfesdale parish church
with members of the rescue services that are still combing the
wreckage.
   Tinsel hung in Lockerbie's windows and the stores were open for
late shoppers. But the heart had gone out of the holiday here. Even
holly wreaths bore messages of grief.
   Christmas ``is really the furthest thing from my mind right now.
It's not important,'' said Joe Horgan, an American who had come to
the village where a relative had died in the crash of Pan Am Flight
103.
   At his service, Annand offered prayers for those killed in the
disaster and their families and for members of the armed services,
police, firemen, ambulance crews and ``all who are enduring long and
arduous hours of work in the search for victims.''
   Similar prayers were offered at Christmas midnight Mass on
Saturday at Lockerbie's Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity.
   Christmas Eve was Day 3 of the search for victims of Wednesday
night's crash, which showered this quiet market town with flames and
shards of jagged metal.
   Authorities say all 258 people aboard the Boeing 747 were killed,
and at least 10 townspeople are missing.
   Horgan, one of about 20 people who lost loved ones and came to
the crash scene in southwestern Scotland, met briefly with reporters
Saturday on condition that his hometown and any details about his
relative on the flight not be disclosed.
   He was accompanied by one of the social workers who were assigned
to help survivors deal with their feelings.
   The Rev. Patrick Keegans of the local Roman Catholic Church put
Christmas preparations aside Saturday to meet with relatives of the
victims who had come to a counseling center in the parish hall.
   Bright sunshine in the morning gave way to drizzle and then a
steady rain in the afternoon as the search for victims and wreckage
went on.
   A half-dozen men stood watchfully opposite town hall, which is
being used as a morgue for about half of the bodies recovered so far.
   One woman walked up and added a bouquet to a pile of cards and
flowers, which stood as testimony to the grief. She quickly departed.
   One bouquet bore a tribute ``to the little girl in the red dress
who lies here, who made my flight from Frankfurt such fun. You
didn't deserve this. God bless. Chas.''
   ``In solidarity from the Armenian earthquake disaster fund,''
said a card. Another came from ``someone who cares in London.''
   A notice board carried condolences from Prince Charles and
Princess Diana, and from President Reagan.
   On the main street of Lockerbie, shoppers were out, but not in
the numbers expected on Christmas Eve.
   ``People haven't had the heart to come out,'' said a ruddy-faced,
blonde young woman at Wilson's bakery. She shyly but firmly declined
to give her name.
   ``This is a very quiet part of Scotland. It's an area that quite
has enjoyed its _ I don't want to say anonymity _ but it's a fairly
secret place,'' said the Rev. John Owen, a Church of Scotland
minister from the outlying parish of Loch Maben.
   ``For a community such as this to find suddenly in our midst so
much death, it has an awesome effect,'' Owen said.

<TEXT>
   The government has declared a holiday
amnesty freeing 26 political prisoners, including a leading
journalist, held three months without formal charges, lawyers for
the inmates said Saturday.
   The Defense Forces headed by the nation's de facto leader, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, issued a news release later Saturday
confirming their release over the past week and calling it a
goodwill gesture.
   The government says the prisoners had ``acted against state
security.''
   Among those released was Alberto Conte, president of the
Panamanian association of journalists. He was set free early
Saturday and flew to Miami, his lawyer, Rogelio Cruz, said in a
telephone interview.
   Conte and the other prisoners had illegally been held without
trial since September, lawyers for the inmates said.
   All the released prisoners belong to the Civic Crusade, a
coalition of 190 political parties, business and professional
groups, and student and labor unions opposed to Noriega.
   Most of the prisoners besides Conte also belonged to the
opposition Authentic Panamanian Party.
   The party is a member of the Civic Crusade, which has been
agitating for months to force Noriega to step down as chief of the
Defense Forces, a position he uses to control the nation's
government.
   Noriega has been indicted by U.S. federal grand juries on charges
of drug trafficking and money laundering. Earlier this year, the
Reagan administration froze Panamanian assets in U.S. banks and
imposed economic sanctions against Panama in an unsuccessful effort
to oust Noriega.
   The United States still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle as
Panama's lawful president. In February, Noriega allies in the
Legislative Assembly forced Delvalle from office and named Manuel
Solis Palma as his successor.
   In another act of Christmas amnesty, Solis Palma reduced
sentences for 240 common criminals without records of drug
involvement, officials said.
   ``The government decision made by the executive follows the
Christmas spirit that is in the hearts of the Panamanian people in
commemoration of the birth of the son of God and the start of the
new year,'' the Defense Forces news release said.

<HEAD>Mayor Denies Any Drug Interest In Hotel Meeting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new details; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traces of cocaine were discovered in the
Washington hotel room of a former city employee who was visited by
Mayor Marion Barry, The Washington Post reported.
   However, the newspaper, in Sunday's editions, quoted a narcotics
officer as saying the test results did not necssarily indicate that
drugs were present in the room recently.
   Barry said it was purely coincidental that he visited
acquaintance Charles Lewis at his hotel room Thursday at about the
time police were checking allegations Lewis had offered drugs to
maids in exchange for sex.
   ``I would never knowingly associate with with anybody using drugs
or dealing with drugs,'' Barry was quoted as saying through a
spokesman. ``Under no circumstances would I associate with anybody
doing this.''
   The Post also reported in Sunday's editions that Barry had
visited the hotel at least six times during the past week, including
visits during the weekend of Dec. 16-17 and twice on Wednesday.
   Barry said on Friday that he visited acquaintence Charles Lewis
at his downtown hotel room on Tuesday and Thursday. Lewis became the
focus of a police investigation following several complaints by
hotel maids that Lewis offered them drugs in exchange for sex.
   Barry released a statement to the Post on Saturday through a
spokesman saying that he ``categorically'' did not visit the hotel
on Wednesday and ``did not see'' Lewis on Dec. 16. Barry, however,
said he could not remember if he visited Lewis at the hotel on Dec.
17.
   The mayor said through the spokesman that he had met with Lewis
three times, but could not remember when the third meeting occurred.
The Post said that minutes after that conversation, the mayor's
spokesman revised his statement to say ``whatever the number of days
the mayor says he saw Lewis, there were never any drugs involved.
The fact is, he doesn't recall every time he saw Lewis.''
   Barry said through his spokesman that he did not see drugs or
paraphernalia in the room, and is not aware of whether Lewis sold or
used drugs.
   The paper said Lewis, 50, was fired from in April from a
high-ranking U.S. Virgin Islands government position after
allegations were raised bout his use of government funds in a joint
Virgin Islands-city government project.
   The public integrity branch of the city Police Department is
investigating the response of two police officers who arrived at the
hotel following the initial call reporting the alleged drug offers
on Thursday. Investigators said the officers left without
interviewing or charging Lewis.
   Barry had arrived at Lewis' hotel room at about 1 p.m. while the
officers were still at the scene, The Post said.
   The paper reported that sources said Barry has made numerous
calls to police officials to find out what they have learned in
their investigation.
   Lewis, who checked out of the Ramada Inn on Friday, apparently
without having been interviewed by police, ran up a $1,990.83 bill
at the hotel on the American Express card of Robert Storey, an aide
in Barry's policy office, the Post said.
   Police said that after Lewis checked out of the hotel, internal
affairs detectives barred the room and tested it for drugs.
   The Post said two unnamed city officials familiar with testing
procedures said the results of the drug test were positive.

<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi has denied U.S.
allegations his country built a chemical weapons plant and accused
Washington of escalating a hostile campaign against Libya, the
official Libyan news agency JANA reported Saturday.
   Libya's foreign ministry echoed the complaint in a letter Friday
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, JANA said.
   The news agency also reported Saturday that Gadhafi said he would
hand over the body of a U.S. pilot killed during the 1986 air raid
on Libya ordered by President Reagan.
   The U.S. government has criticized Libya recently, saying it
built a huge chemical weapons plant, and Reagan has said military
action against the plant was under consideration. Libya says the
factory in question produces pharmaceuticals.
   Gadhafi made his comments in a letter to the chairman of the
non-aligned movement, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, JANA
reported without saying when the letter was sent.
   He urged Mugabe to help counter the U.S. campaign that he said
``constitutes a threat to international security and peace,'' said
JANA, monitored in the Italian capital.
   The letter to Perez de Cuellar sent by the secretary of the
People's Committee for the People's Foreign Liaison Bureau, or
foreign ministry, reiterated Libya's ``unequivocal rejection of
these groundless claims and allegations,'' the news agency said.
   The letter also told the U.N. chief that Libya adheres to
international conventions and accords concerning chemical weapons
and participates ``in all efforts aimed at banning chemical
weapons,'' JANA said.
   Reagan said in an interview aired Thursday night on ABC-TV that
military action against the site has been under consideration by the
United States and its allies. But ``that's a decision that has not
been made yet,'' he said.
   The United States bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for a
terrorist attack on a Berlin disco that killed a U.S. serviceman and
wounded 204 other people.
   Gadhafi said the body of pilot Capt. Paul Lorence would be given
to his family ``through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in
London and Rome.
   Lorence, 31, of San Francisco was in an F-111 that disappeared
during the April 15, 1986, raid on Tripoli and Benghazi. The other
17 U.S. Air Force bombers returned safely to their bases after
dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the two cities.
   After the 1986 raids, diplomats in Libya said Gadhafi was
demanding a ransom or concessions from the United States before
returning the airman's body.

   The propane truck that blew up and burned
after hitting a retaining wall on a downtown interstate, killing
nine people, had passed an inspection just the day before, officials
said Saturday.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators picked over
debris from Friday's crash and also checked the records of the truck
and driver, who was one of those who died in the crash. The driver
had only minor violations on his record and was thoroughly familiar
with the route, officials said late Saturday.
   Eight of the dead were killed as a result of the blast and fire
following the accident, including two people injured in their homes
who died Saturday at a hospital. A ninth person died in a separate
accident in the traffic jam that resulted from the crash,
authorities said.
   A team from the NTSB examined the crash site Saturday and tried
to recreate the accident, said NTSB member James E. Burnett.
   The initial investigation showed that the truck driven by Randall
Benson, 29, of West Memphis, Ark., got a roadside inspection
Thursday by the Arkansas Department of Transportation and found free
of defects, Burnett said.
   Benson, who worked for Wooten Transports Inc., had a good driving
record and had navigated the route of the accident many times, he
said.
   ``He was thoroughly familiar with the route and with the job he
was doing,'' Burnett said. ``Obviously, something happened. We're
not ready to say the driver lost control. It could have been
something else.''
   Benson was certified as medically fit to drive hazardous
materials and had passed a drug test a year ago, Burnett said. He
driving record was clean except for backing into an object and
hitting a car while making a right turn.
   The NTSB plans to continue the investigation but estimated the
final report is far from complete.
   NTSB experts met Saturday morning ``with the various parties or
people who have involvement in this accident and organized the
investigation,'' said board spokesman Michael Benson.
   The accident involved ``interstate trucking and hazardous
materials and that's why we're concerned about that,'' he said.
   In addition to studying the records of the trucking company,
driver and truck, investigators will examine the layout of the
interstate and the response of emergency personnel, he said.
   ``We'll be looking at probable cause and any safety issues that
may have relevance anywhere else in the country,'' Benson said.
   The 100,000-gallon tanker truck skidded on a 25 mph exit ramp of
Interstate 240 in the Midtown section of Memphis, struck a retaining
wall and exploded, said fire department Capt. Benny McDow.
   The tank shot 125 yards and crashed into a duplex apartment,
crushing the building and killing a 10-year-old girl inside. A
mammoth fireball set several other houses and nearby cars on fire.
   Benson said six NTSB investigators will head teams of local and
state authorities.
   ``The field phase of the investigation may take up to a week. The
entire investigation will take up a minimum of nine months,'' Benson
said. ``We go into it very thoroughly.''
   Some of the investigators went to the site Friday night to take a
preliminary look, and more went to the scene Saturday. The work will
continue through the Christmas holiday, said Benson.
   Besides Benson, the dead included Harrison G. Lee, 34, Brighton,
Tenn., a motorist; Robert Wardlow, 40, Memphis, a motorist; Tina
Wiles, 30, Vicksburg, Miss., a motorist; Warner Wiles, 70,
Vicksburg, Miss., Mrs. Wiles' father-in-law; and Shelanda Towles,
10, killed in her house.
   Iva J. Rubesheim, 87, who lived in the other half of the duplex
from Shelanda, and James M. Malone, 57, who lived in another burned
home, both died Saturday in the Regional Medical Center.
   Traffic backed up several miles and a second truck driver, David
Bailey, 29, of West Helena, Ark., was killed when his 18-wheeler
plowed into the rear of a car tied up in the jam, police said.

   The Federal Aviation Administration has advised
airports worldwide to tighten security because of concern _ not yet
confirmed by investigators _ that a terrorist bomb may have caused
the Pan Am crash in Scotland.
   FAA Administrator Allan McArtor said Friday the alert was
prompted by the crash, the heavy Christmas travel period and ``what
obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions''
regarding terrorist activities.
   The advisory to beef up security applies to both major U.S.
airports and airlines and foreign airports served by U.S. carriers,
he said.
   McArtor, in an interview with reporters, declined to discuss
specifically Wednesday's crash of Pan Am Flight 103, in which all

   Bickering between Nicaragua and
Honduras is threatening a summit planned for next month by Central
American leaders anxious to end the civil wars and hostilities in
the region.
   The latest stumbling block comes from the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, Netherlands. The World Court agreed this week
to hear Nicaragua's claims that Honduras has been harboring and
supporting U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, who are fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said Wednesday
the World Court's decision threatens the future of negotiated
settlements to the region's problems. He said the court's move is
politically charged and sets ``a judicial precedent totally
incompatible with peace negotiations.''
   In addition, President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras has
threatened to boycott regional peace talks unless Nicaragua drops
its World Court case.
   Lopez and the foreign ministers of Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala, and Costa Rica met earlier this month in Mexico. There
they agreed that heads of state would convene in January in an
effort to breathe new life into the stalled August 1987 peace plan.

   A crack addict desperate for treatment brought
police his paraphernalia, then smashed windows at two precincts
before a judge relented and sentenced him to a drug program he calls
his ``best Christmas gift yet.''
   ``I will thank him for giving me an opportunity for starting my
life back over. He is an understanding man, one of very few,''
Alexis Vega said Friday of Bronx Criminal Court Judge John Moore.
   Vega, 34, said his life had bordered on the insane until Moore
sentenced him to 90 days in a drug treatment program. As a crack
cocaine addict, Vega lost his job as a construction worker. He
stopped paying bills. He became irresponsible and dirty. His wife of
two years, Josephine Coulter, feared for their 11-month-old son and
her two daughters, now 12 and 13.
   Last July, Miss Coulter threw him out of their home in New York
City's tough South Bronx section ``because I was doing wrong,'' he
said. ``She is a Christian and I didn't want to be around her.''

   A ``serious and substantial morale problem''
afflicts the nation's 53,500 Roman Catholic priests, many of whom
are overworked, lonely and sexually troubled, says a groundbreaking
report by a panel of U.S. bishops.
   Discussing openly problems that once were kept quiet, the
Bishops' Committee on Priestly Life and Ministry said some priests
are just going through the motions, and many ``have settled for a
part-time presence to their priesthood.''
   Part of the priests' morale problem, said the committee of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, comes from the feeling that
they are caught between Vatican directives and a Catholic laity that
is often at odds with Rome. Pope John Paul II has urged priests to
accept suffering as part of their fate, but the American bishops
have said that is not helpful and have compiled suggestions on how
to improve priests' morale.

   Carols filtered through
loudspeakers and drifted across Manger Square, but few Christmas Eve
pilgrims were on hand to hear them in this biblical town, where
soldiers seemed to outnumber celebrants.
   A driving rain, a Palestinian general strike and heavy Israeli
security kept crowds slim. As darkness fell, troops with automatic
rifles stood guard on rooftops, including that of the Church of the
Nativity, which marks the site where Jesus Christ is said to have
been born.
   The few visitors who spent the afternoon in Bethlehem huddled
under Manger Square's arcade, outside shops closed down by striking
Palestinians. In other parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, five Palestinians were reported wounded, one in a clash
with troops and four in a clash with an Arab village official
accused of collaborating with Israel, Arab reports said.

   PLO leaders, faced with growing dissension
among radical factions, met Saturday to discuss forming a government
for an independent Palestinian state and map the next move in
crucial talks with the United States.
   Most of the 15 members of the PLO's governing body attended the
meeting at chief Yasser Arafat's home outside Baghdad, Palestine
Liberation Organization officials said.
   The meeting followed growing opposition by radical Palestinian
factions and some figures within the PLO to Arafat's stated
recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.
   U.S. officials insisted on such statements before they would deal
with the PLO.

   Police stormed a prison and crushed an
uprising by inmates who were denied Christmas pardons, but at least
22 people were killed during the two-day siege, including the
warden, officials said Saturday.
   ``There was a fierce gunfight lasting about 15 minutes before the
special forces could quell the mutiny'' on Friday night, said police
officer Sergio Anzaldo, who was on duty when the commandos attacked
the prison.
   At least six people were seriously wounded during the uprising.
Anzaldo said 130 commandos flown in from Mexico City stormed the
prison after a group of inmates had held 14 prison employees and
visiting relatives hostage for 32 hours. The uprising began Thursday
after the mutinous prisoners were denied pardons given at Christmas
to inmates whose behavior has been good.
