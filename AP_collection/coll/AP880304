<HEAD>Study: Drug Producers Reaping Bigger Profits Because of
Enforcement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government efforts to curb the flow
of smuggled drugs have failed and may have actually boosted profits
for Latin American cocaine and marijuana growers, a RAND Corp.
study said Thursday.
   Latin American drug producers make money whether the drugs are
successfully smuggled or intercepted, said the study by the private
think-tank's National Defense Research Institute. If the drugs are
intercepted, more must be shipped.
   ``Thus, we conclude that cocaine interdiction has probably
increased the export earnings of producers in Bolivia, Colombia and
Peru,'' the study said.
   The U.S. government has tripled its spending to battle smuggling
and has seized more narcotics, but an even greater amount is
getting through to meet demands of American drug users who can pay
higher prices, the study said.
   The study noted that from fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1985, seizures
of cocaine rose from less than 2 metric tons to more than 25 metric
tons, while seizures of marijuana were halved from 4,000 metric
tons to 2,000 metric tons.
   Meantime, the study said, the amount of cocaine believed to be
reaching the United States rose from between 38 and 68 metric tons
in 1981 to between 111 and 153 metric tons in 1985, the latest year
for which figures were available.
   For marijuana, the amount reaching the United States rose from
between 8,700 and 12,700 metric tons in 1981 to between 9,447 and
12,228 metric tons in 1985.
   The study said it based its figures on estimates from the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration.
   From fiscal 1981 to fiscal 1986, federal spending on
interception of drugs rose from $237 million to $801 million, the
study said.

   A woman accused of killing a psychiatric
social worker at a hospital Feb. 16 was ruled incompetent to stand
trial Thursday.
   Allegheny County Judge Robert Dauer ordered 31-year-old Edith
Anderson committed to Mayview State Hospital for at least 90 days
after the director of the county's behavior clinic diagnosed her a
paranoid schizophrenic.
   Ms. Anderson, who has a 13-year history of mental problems, is
charged with shooting Linda Rosen, 27, at St. Francis Medical
Center and holding three people hostage for about 90 minutes before
surrendering.
   The woman shouted angrily during Thursday's hearing about being
sent to Mayview. In three months, the judge will decide whether she
is fit to stand trial.
   Earlier this week Ms. Anderson told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
she shot Ms. Rosen after becoming angry at the thought that the
mental health system that once forced her to take drugs was now
keeping them from her.
   After running out of drugs that controlled her schizophrenia,
she had problems obtaining more medication because her welfare
prescription card had expired, she said.
   She said that when she carried a handgun into the hospital, ``I
felt ... I got the power tonight, I am the one. I was in charge
like I probably will never be again.''
   Hours before the slaying, a mental health counselor at Braddock
General Hospital started the process of committing her to a mental
hospital after she said, ``I feel it makes sense to kill,''
authorities said.
   But before the counselor could complete the commitment, Ms.
Anderson abruptly left the hospital.

   The House on Thursday rejected a package of
$30 million in ``humanitarian'' aid for Nicaragua's Contras and for
young victims of the war. The proposal had been pushed by Democrats
as an alternative to military aid for the rebels.
   The final vote of 216-208 was a defeat for House Speaker Jim
Wright and his Democratic lieutenants, who had sought to craft a
package that would diffuse pressure for future military aid for the
rebels. But it also damaged administration hopes that the Contras,
whose last U.S. aid ran out Tuesday, could be given any new
infusion of aid in the near future.
   Liberal Democrats opposed to the Contras joined Republicans, who
thought the package too weak, in voting it down.
   House action came just a month after the House rejected
President Reagan's request for both humanitarian and military aid.
   The Democratic package had included money for food, clothing,
medicine and shelter for the anti-Sandinista rebels and a $14
million program of aid for children injured in the Nicaraguan civil
war.
   Reagan welcomed the vote, but Wright, D-Texas, said it may prove
``a somewhat pyrrhic victory'' for Republicans. Wright said he had
no immediate plans to revive a Contra aid plan, and other Democrats
vowed to make any new try for aid difficult.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it ought to be a damned lengthy
process,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter, and
a Contra opponent.
   ``This has effectively stopped aid for the near future,'' added
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
   In a written statement, Reagan called on Congress ``to act
urgently to develop an aid package which is effectively deliverable
and of sufficient quantity to sustain the Nicaraguan freedom
fighters.
   ``If not, the prospects for peace and democracy inside Nicaragua
will diminish quickly,'' Reagan said.
   The House had set up a procedure under which the
Democrat-written package would come before the chamber as an
amendment to a competing but similar Republican bill. It was
adopted on a vote of 215 to 210, replacing the GOP version. But
minutes later, the entire package was defeated on a final vote. The
House never voted on the Republican plan.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who led the Republican debate,
said supporters of Contra aid were never given an option they could
support.
   ``This plan didn't do anything,'' he said. ``It was just a
lousy, lousy bill. We were saying we weren't going to vote for it,
and they didn't believe it.''
   As he returned to the White House from a NATO summit in
Brussels, Belgium, Reagan said ``I'm very happy'' when asked about
the defeat of the Democratic package. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
explained the president meant he was happy to have another ``chance
to work on an adequate package of humanitarian aid for the freedom
fighters.''
   However, a spokeswoman for the Contras said in Miami that the
leadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance, a Contra umbrella group,
had wanted the measure to pass.
   ``Every time the United States turns its back on the Contras, it
puts us in a less favorable position,'' said Contra spokeswoman
Marta Sacasa. The Sandinistas ``will become even more intransigent
and more hard line....
   ``We are fighting against an enemy that doesn't have these kinds
of problems. The aid from the Soviet Union has not stopped flowing
to the Sandinistas,'' Ms. Sacasa said.
   The Sandinista government hailed the vote and called for direct
talks between Reagan and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   The vote ``must contribute to the peace efforts taken by the
presidents of the Central American countries,'' a statement
released by government spokesman Manuel Espinoza said.
   Reagan, in a letter from Brussels, said the Democratic plan
``does not meet the essential criteria'' of maintaining military
pressure on the Sandinistas.
   Wright called the dispute over the aid package ``a battle for
peace in Nicaragua, and for a constructive role for the United
States in Central America as opposed to a destructive role.''
   Reagan, in his letter, agreed that the vote represented ``a
watershed in our policies toward Central America.'' But he said the
Democratic proposal would have led ``to rapid debilitation of the
resistance and further encouragement of Sandinista intransigence.''
   The Republican alternative, he said, would ave kept alive
``prospects for democracy and meaningful talks toward peace.''
   The Democratic package included about $16 million in food,
clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels, intended to last at
least through June; and $14 million to set up a fund to help
children injured in the seven-year Nicaraguan civil war.
   On Feb. 3, the House defeated, 219-211, a $36.2 million Reagan
proposal that included money for weapons and other military
equipment.
   In debate Thursday, both sides argued that their version would
best enhance a Central American peace process.
   ``Our opportunity today is to construct a united position on
Nicaragua policy for the first time in eight years,'' said Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind., a sponsor of the Democratic package.
   ``It says to the Contras that the United States is not going to
provide them the means to make war. But neither is the United
States going to turn away from them,'' Hamilton said.
   But Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., called the proposal ``a
surrender package. It could turn the freedom fighters into refugees
in their own country.''
   Cease-fire talks between the two warring sides were stalled as
the debate occurred in Congress.
   But Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega proposed for the first
time holding high-level direct talks inside Nicaragua, without
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has been serving as a mediator.
The Contras agreed to a meeting, but only if Obando were included
as a ``witness and guarantor.''
   In seeking to craft a majority for their package, Democrats were
faced with challenges from at least two sides. They needed the
votes of moderates who were reluctant to totally abandon the
rebels, believing that they provide useful pressure to keep the
Sandinistas bargaining in good faith.
   They also needed the votes of the party's liberal wing, most of
whom have steadfastly refused to vote for aid to the rebels in any
form.
   Party leaders argued that passage of this purely
``humanitarian'' aid bill would lessen chances that Reagan could
come back to Congress soon with a request for weapons and
ammunition to sustain the Contras.
   The Republican alternative contained more money for the rebels _
about $22 million _ and placed fewer restrictions on the way the
Contras could use the aid, allowing purchase of non-lethal military
supplies. The GOP package also contained a children's aid fund
similar to that proposed by Democrats.
   The GOP package also would have permitted the president to ask
for military aid any time after April 15 and would have expedited
action on such a request.
   Even before the House acted, White House chief of staff Howard
Baker said the administration would go to the Senate for whatever
it failed to obtain in the House. ``We have good strength in the
Senate,'' he said.
   Republicans noted that the Democratic bill would turn over
responsibility for delivery of the supplies to the Defense
Department, rather than the existing CIA-run supply network. Even
if the Pentagon retained the private contractors now used by the
CIA to make supply flights, U.S. military personnel would have to
be present in the region to oversee them, Edwards said.
   The Republican alternative would have left the delivery of
supplies in the hands of the CIA.

<HEAD>Deaths From Tainted Drugs Prompt Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The deaths of 14 hospital patients from
tainted drugs has prompted an investigaton of India's
pharmaceutical industry and accusations that health is being
sacrificed to greed and corruption.
   ``Adulterators and purveyors of death move freely in society,
heads high,'' said Judge Bakhtavar Lentin of the Bombay High Court,
who led the 17-month inquiry.
   He finished nearly three months ago but his findings have not
been made public. The 14 patients, who were from the lower middle
class and ranged in age from 10 to 75, died two years ago from the
effects of tainted glycerol, a drug used to treat edema, or
abnormal swelling.
   Failure of the Maharashtra state government to release the
report has encouraged charges of slipshod manufacturing in India's
16,000 drug companies and of government connivance in certifying
substandard drugs.
   Chief Minister S.B. Chavan, the highest elected official of
Maharashtra, appointed Lentin as an investigating magistrate, but
the government is not obligated to prosecute on the basis of his
report and the law does not require the report to be made public.
   Lentin has pressed to have his findings made public. Chavan said
the report will be presented to the legislature in March but has
not given a date.
   State governments certify drugs in India and 60 percent of the
industry is located in Maharashtra, a western state of which Bombay
is the capital. Some other states also use the Maharashtra
government laboratory for drug certification.
   India's drug business is worth $1.8 billion a year and exports
total $203 million of that, but there is no indication tainted
products have been exported.
   Most finished medicines go to the Soviet Union, Africa, the
Middle East and Southeast Asia. Bulk drugs also are sold to
manufacturers in Europe, the United States and Australia.
   Indubhai A. Modi, president of the Indian Drug Manufacturers
Association, said all companies are being blamed for the shoddy
work done by a few small ones. According to figures presented to
Parliament, 14 percent of Indian drugs tested in 1986-87 were
substandard.
   Dr. Arun Bal, secretary of the Association for Consumer Action
on Safety and Health, says about 40,000 drug formulations are
produced in India, compared with 250 the World Health Organization
describes as essential.
   ``Even the federal drug controller does not have an exact
figure,'' he said. ``This is ridiculous.''
   The industry has been under attack since the 14 patients died in
January 1986 at the government-run Jamshetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital in
Bombay after being given glycerol contaminated with toxic
diethylene glycol.
   Lentin's inquiry took testimony from 120 witnesses, and charges
of perjury were lodged against a former state health minister and
four other people. The investigation was conducted in public, not a
common practice in India, and unearthed facts embarrassing to state
officials.
   One was that the tainted glycerol originally was labeled
``industrial glycerine,'' was substandard even for that category
and went through several middlemen before being packed for hospital
use.
   Charges were made that employees of the state Food and Drug
Administration sometimes drank rather than tested samples of
``country liquor,'' or illicit alcohol, sent for analysis.
   There were complaints that agency employees demanded bribes. A
drug company owner, J. Sipahilalani, testified: ``Diwali comes more
than once every year for FDA officers.'' Diwali is an Indian
holiday on which gifts are given.
   The most sensational revelation, a list of 582 drugs declared
substandard but still on the market, became known as the FDA
``murder book.'' Among the products were medicines used for typhoid
and for serious diarrhea, often a cause of death among Indian
infants.
   Included were drugs made by major Indian companies and
subsidiaries of multinational manufacturers: Parke Davis, Raptakos
Brett, Rallis India, Roche Products and Lupin Laboratories.
   Some companies whose products were listed described the defects
as minor and said they were caused by later handling, not
manufacturing.
   V.H. Bhat, a spokesman for Roche, said chipped sugar coating on
vitamin tablets ``could be due to mishandling by persons concerned
or in transport.'' C.M. Hattangadi, president of Parke Davis-India,
said some tablets found to contain less than the stated amount of
ingredients were a ``stray case'' that ``could be due to high
humidity, high temperature or poor transport arrangements.''
   State officials concede privately that proper procedures were
not followed in buying the tainted glycerol and said some FDA
employees have been suspended.
   A senior doctor at Jamshetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital said a report
in 1972 recommended changes in hospital rules for buying and using
medicines, but it was not implemented. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Drug makers say Indian drugs have been instrumental in
increasing the average life span of Indians from 32 years in 1947
to 54 today, and that the more than 600 percent increase of exports
in a decade was achieved by quality.
   ``We want spurious drug manufacturers prosecuted for murder,''
said Modi, president of the manufacturers association, ``but for a
microscopic minority, why paint us all black?''

   Ibrahim Radaydeh's name is
scrawled on walls all over town. He is a marked man and knows it.
His fellow Palestinians may kill him as an informer.
   Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel have been
attacked by their neighbors. One was lynched.
   It is a sign of the spread and greater organization of the Arab
uprising that began 12 weeks ago in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Israel was shocked when other villagers in Qabatiyeh hanged
Mohammed Ayad from a utility pole and burned his house. During the
five-hour rampage last week, Ayad fired on the crowd with an
Israeli-issue Uzi submachine gun, killing a 4-year-old boy.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization applauded the lynching in
leaflets distributed in the West Bank.
   Arsonists have burned shops or homes of other suspects, many of
whom have been identified by name on a pirate Arabic-language radio
station.
   About two dozen Palestinians have renounced connections with
Israel over mosque loudspeakers in the past two weeks, handed over
Israeli-supplied weapons to village leaders and received letters
saying they have reformed, the Arab-run Palestine Press Service
reported.
   It said most West Bank villages are believed to have a few
collaborators, although the agency estimated they total less 1
percent of the 800,000 Arabs in the territory.
   Residents say there are about 10 suspects in Obediyeh, a town of
7,000 people on the outskirts of Bethlehem. The main job of
informers in the current turmoil is to give Israeli authorities the
names of activists in their villages.
   Some work for money, special privileges or promotions in their
jobs in Israel. Others became informers in exchange for shorter
sentences after they were arrested.
   Israeli soldiers have done little to help the collaborators, and
leaders of both major parties have said that may cost Israel the
few allies it has among Palestinians.
   ``As a Jew and a soldier, I am ashamed,'' former Defense
Minister Ariel Sharon of the right-wing Likud bloc said after Ayad
was lynched. ``How could we have left this man without help for so
many hours? This was a moral failure.''
   Amnon Linn, a legislator from the center-right Labor Party,
said: ``Now every Arab in the occupied territories knows this is
what he can expect if he is working with us to achieve peace.''
   Radaydeh, 41, is suspected of helping his nephew, Ali Abu Bakr,
give the Israelis information. Abu Bakr is said to have bragged
about a year ago that he worked with the army.
   His neighbors were willing to overlook it then, but not now in
the heat of the uprising.
   He three-room home, where he lived with his wife and six
children, was gutted by fire last week and he fled the town. His
burned-out car still sits outside the shell.
   ``If Abu Bakr tries to come back here, he will be massacred,''
said an elderly man, barefoot and wearing a long robe, who gave his
name only as Khalid. ``Parents whose sons were arrested will be
after him.''
   Some villagers said they had suspected Radaydeh for months but
most became convinced he was a collaborator only last weekend, when
he was seen standing on a dirt road watching about 100 masked
villagers protest.
   No soldiers were there, but the next night troops entered town
and arrested 32 of the protesters.
   That was enough for Radaydeh's neighbors. Spray-painted messages
like this appeared on the walls of homes throughout Obediyeh: ``We
warn collaborators like Ibrahim Radaydeh to flee as soon as
possible. Beware, hypocrites.''
   One protester who not at home when the soldiers came was
31-year-old Jamil, who would not give his last name.
   ``Collaborators are worse than the Israelis,'' he said. ``They
are an internal enemy. They know everything and can do more harm.
Radaydeh has no future in this village.''
   Jamil stood outside a friend's house watching the road for signs
of Israeli army jeeps.
   During an interview in his home, Radaydeh insisted on his
innocence. He squinted nervously, smoking a cigarette.
   ``I want you to write that I went to a Bethlehem newspaper and
asked them to publish an announcement denouncing my nephew, Abu
Bakr,'' he said. ``I think collaborators should be lynched. I want
the PLO to know I am not one. These are rumors spread by a few
vicious children.''
   His neighbors are unmoved.
   Mahtar Assin, the mukhtar, or town leader, sipped thick, sweet
Arabic coffee and said: ``Whatever he says, the Palestinian
revolution may well take its revenge next on Ibrahim. If he wants
to be safe, Radaydeh should leave Obediyeh now.''

   His name didn't appear on the agenda,
but it was on nearly every leader's lips during the first NATO
summit since Mikhail S. Gorbachev assumed power in the Kremlin
three years ago.
   Gorbachev was a shadow on the wall as President Reagan and
leaders of 15 Western democracies tried to size up their potential
foe.
   The two-day session was designed mainly to present a united
front on key arms control issues before Reagan travels to Moscow in
May or June for his fourth summit with the Soviet Commmist Party
leader.
   But the alliance meeting showed how intensely Washington and its
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies are trying to assess the
implications of Gorbachev's efforts to open up parts of Soviet
society. They wonder whether it will help Western security or harm
it.
   The meeting also underscored the difference in Western views _
particularly between Washington and London on one hand and Paris
and Bonn on the other _ about how NATO governments should deal with
Gorbachev.
   Some want to give Gorbachev the benefit of the doubt; others do
not.
   The issue is important to NATO because Gorbachev in recent
months appears to have succeeded in portraying himself to much of
the West European public as more of a peace seeker than the West's
leaders.
   A Gallup poll last year said 58 percent of Britons thought
Russia sincerely wanted peaceful relations with NATO, while only 33
percent thought its foreign policy initiatives should be treated
with great suspicion.
   The West German magazine Der Spiegel says that according to
recent polls conducted on its behalf, Gorbachev has become the
first Soviet leader to get a higher popularity rating than an
American president.
   The Reagan administration is worried about the popularity among
many West Europeans of Gorbachev's goal of eliminating all nuclear
weapons from the European continent.
   Washington fears that if this happened the trans-Atlantic
partnership would be severed and Western Europe would be vulnerable
to Soviet intimidation.
   A joint NATO declaration Thursday noted ``encouraging signs of
change'' in Soviet policies and welcomed moves to open up the East
bloc societies.
   But it also said the Western nations must ``look beyond
pronouncements'' for tangible and lasting changes that directly
address the issues that have kept the European continent divided
for four decades.
   This was a reference partly to what the NATO countries consider
to be a systematic denial by the Soviets of basic human rights for
their citizens, and, in part, the Soviet military domination of
Eastern Europe.
   Yet for all their words of caution, some Western leaders appear
increasingly convinced that Gorbachev is genuine in saying he wants
to establish more peaceful relations with the West at a lower level
of arms.
   ``Gorbachev has opened possibilities that we should take
advantage of dynamically and boldly. That's where the challenge
lies,'' Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens told the NATO
conference.
   He said ``the future of Europe'' may depend on the outcome of
Gorbachev's reform efforts.
   French President Francois Mitterrand was quoted by his aides as
telling the Brussels summit that the Soviet Union was undergoing an
``historic transition.''
   ``We must not be naive, but we must show flexibility that will
enable dialogue and which will have an effect on Gorbachev's
actions,'' he said.
   Last week, Mitterrand was quoted in a French newspaper interview
as saying NATO should put off plans to modernize some of its
nuclear weapons in Europe in order not to upset the trend of
improving East-West relations. He did not specifically address this
in Brussels.
   Most of the other alliance leaders want to go ahead with the
weapons modernization program.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said after Thursday's
meeting that NATO must keep its defenses strong by upgrading
nuclear as well as non-nuclear weaponry, regardless of signs of
change in the Kremlin.
   ``So long as our defense stays sure, we have nothing to fear''
from Gorbachev's reforms, she said.

   They sat side by side beneath bright
television lights in a huge government hearing room, a vivacious
student council president and her newfound friend with AIDS.
   The White House commission listened intently as Ryan White and
Jill Stewart told their stories Thursday.
   ``I came face to face with death at 13 years old,'' said Ryan.
   ``No one realizes how much he has done for us,'' said Jill. ``He
helps us put life in perspective in so many ways.''
   It was three years ago when doctors discovered Ryan had AIDS _ a
victim of contaminated blood products used to treat his hemophilia
_ and gave him six months to live.
   But the Indiana youngster, now 16 and planning for an
advertising career, or maybe architecture, refused to accept that.
He told the presidential AIDS commission that he decided ``to live
a normal life, to go to school, be with my friends and enjoy
day-to-day activities.''
   ``I'm a normal, happy teen-ager again,'' he continued.
   He's on AZT now, a drug that helps prolong the lives of people
with AIDS, but does not cure the fatal disease.
   ``I have a learner's permit, I attend sports functions and
dances. I made the honor roll just recently, with two As and two
Bs. ... I believe in myself as I look forward to graduating ... in
1991.''
   But it wasn't that way until Ryan moved to Cicero, Ind., last
summer _ three doors up from Jill _ and enrolled at Hamilton
Heights High School in nearby Arcadia.
   In Kokomo, another Indiana town, things had not been so good.
   ``Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination,
fear, panic and lies surrounded me,'' he told the commission.
   ``I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother and I was
not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would
not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not
shake my hand.''
   As word of his plight spread around the country, Ryan started
making new friends _ but mostly from far away places.
   ``Mayor (Edward) Koch of New York was the first public figure to
give me support,'' he said. ``I met some of the greatest, like
Elton John, Greg Louganis, Max Headroom, Alyssa Milano _ my teen
idol _ Lyndon King and Charlie Sheen. All of these plus many more
became my friends, but I had very few friends at school.
   ``I tried to ignore the injustice, because I knew the people
were wrong. My family and I held no hatred for those people because
we realized they were victims of their own ignorance. We had great
faith that, with patience, understanding, and education, that my
family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes
around.''
   Yet, finally, they decided to move.
   The people in Cicero and Arcadia had heard of Ryan and they
prepared themselves for him.
   Jill, who aspires to study human genetics next year in college,
or maybe law, told about how the 600 students at her school ``had
witnessed Ryan's pain in his former community'' and how they
determined ``there was no reason for Ryan to go through that pain
again.''
   She told how school officials worked with the student council
and parents to educate the community about AIDS. Within the first
few days of school last fall, she said, the kids had exhausted all
their questions about AIDS.
   ``By this time, they were asking how they could help Ryan,'' she
said. ``They were asking to sit beside him.''
   The commission was impressed.
   ``The children always teach the adults,'' observed Commissioner
Burton James Lee III, a renowned cancer doctor at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York Center.
   Commissioner Theresa L. Crenshaw, a physician from California,
said she hoped the lesson would be ``contagious.''
   The retired Navy admiral who heads the commission suggested a
round of applause for the teen-agers, the first such demonstration
granted any of the nearly 400 witnesses that have appeared before
the panel.
   Jill and Ryan met with reporters afterward.
   ``This may be a little personal,'' said one, ``but do you have a
girl friend?''
   ``No,'' said Ryan, ``but I have a lot of friends who are girls.''
   Jill smiled.

Campaign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Partisan squabbling, charges of justice for
sale and million-dollar campaigns have thrown the historically
clubby, even genteel, Texas Supreme Court into a political tempest.
   As much at issue in the March 8 Democratic and Republican
primary campaigns as the nominations for five seats on the
nine-member court is the reputation of the high court itself.
   Texas is the last big state to elect its appeals justices.
   In unusually high-profile developments over the last year, the
troubled Supreme Court has seen two justices publicly reprimanded,
two others depart because of disagreement over whether justices
should be elected or appointed, and Republicans bidding to achieve
their first majority on the court.
   ``It is, I think, without question the most important judicial
election in Texas ever, certainly the most important judicial
election in over 100 years,'' said Thomas Phillips, the only
Republican chief justice this century.
   Phillips was appointed to the court by GOP Gov. Bill Clements,
who said the judge ``represents the first volley in the fight for a
judicial selection in Texas in which merit and fairness are the
determining factors in the selection of Supreme Court justices.''
   Phillips, a Houston district judge, succeeded Democrat John
Hill, who resigned to return to private practice and champion the
cause of an appointed appellate judiciary. Hill charges that the
election process leads to big donations from lawyers who have cases
before the court.
   CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' did a segment on the court late last
year titled, ``Is Texas Justice For Sale?''
   Hill's resignation was followed by that of Justice Robert
Campbell, who argued that appointing judges is ``a mere scheme to
give big business interests the power to control our courts.''
   Clements again appointed a Republican, Judge Barbara Culver of
Midland, to replace Campbell, giving the GOP two Supreme Court
justices for the first time this century.
   Neither Phillips nor Ms. Culver has an opponent in the
Republican primary and they are expected to lead the so-called GOP
court reform slate, which hopes to capitalize on negative publicity
to defeat Democrats in November.
   Justice William Kilgarlin, for example, was publicly admonished
by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct last June. The
commission's report listed Kilgarlin's failure to require staff
members to observe proper ethical standards and the solicitation of
funds.
   Kilgarlin dismissed the criticism as insignificant and
immediately announced for re-election.
   Only recently, campaign reports showed that Kilgarlin and
Justice Ted Robertson had received $25,000 apiece in January from
Joe Jamail, the lead attorney for Pennzoil Co. in its lawsuit
against Texaco Inc., two months after the Supreme Court upheld a
multibillion-dollar verdict favoring Pennzoil.
   Jamail and his family have contributed $288,000 to sitting
Supreme Court justices since 1980.
   Kilgarlin's opponent in the Democratic primary is State District
Judge Carol Haberman, a former San Antonio city council member.
   Republicans seeking that seat are Justice Nathan Hecht of the
5th Court of Appeals in Dallas, D. Camille Dunn of the 1st Court of
Appeals in Houston, and Ronald Block, a Houston attorney who lives
in Missouri City.
   Dallas lawyer John Humphreys opposes Robertson in the Democratic
primary for chief justice.
   The Democrats avoided a possible party-splitting campaign
between former U.S. Rep. Jack Hightower and former state Sen. Lloyd
Doggett when Hightower switched to a race with no Democratic
opponent. He will face Ms. Culver in November.
   Doggett is opposed by State District Judge Marsha Anthony of
Houston, who became known statewide three years ago when she
declared the state's no pass, no play rule unconstitutional. That
ruling was reversed by the state Supreme Court.
   Republicans George Barbary, a Dallas attorney, and Justice Paul
Murphy of the 14th Court of Appeals in Houston oppose each other in
the race for that seat on the court.
   The late entry of San Antonio lawyer Art Vega spoiled Justice
Raul Gonzalez's previously uncontested bid for the Democratic Party
nomination. Gonzalez is the first Hispanic elected to statewide
office in Texas.
   Justice Charles Ben Howell, also of the 5th Court of Appeals in
Dallas, is unopposed in the GOP primary for that seat. Howell lost
a Supreme Court race in 1986.

<HEAD>Three-Quarters Of Commodity Subsidies To Be Paid By End Of March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Estimates by the Agriculture Department show
that farmers will have received about $9 billion in direct federal
subsidies by the end of March for participating in 1987 commodity
programs.
   Part of the payments has been in cash, but most has been in
generic certificates that can be redeemed for surplus commodities
held by the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   Another installment was announced Thursday. Milton Hertz,
executive vice president of the CCC, said farmers who participated
in last year's feed grain program will get about $1.45 billion in
government ``deficiency'' payments this month.
   Hertz said the payments will include about $1.3 billion for corn
farmers and $225 million for sorghum producers, all in certificates.
   Under the program, deficiency payments are required when average
market prices fall below a prescribed target price. The payments
make up the difference between the target and the market price or
support level, whichever is higher.
   In addition to the $1.45 billion due this month, corn producers
received about $2.6 billion in advance payments for 1987
participation, and sorghum producers got advances of $225 million.
   According to figures supplied by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, which is headed by Hertz,
total deficiency payments for 1987 crops may be around $12 billion,
slightly less than the $12.6 billion paid to farmers under 1986
programs.
   Counting the payments for feed grains announced Thursday,
payments through March are expected to total about $9 billion, with
the possibility of an additional $3 billion to come as final
settlements for 1987 participation.
   The feed grain deficiency payments are expected to reach about
$7.3 billion for 1987. Other projections included totals for:
sorghum, $612 million; barley, $294 million; oats, $19 million;
wheat, $3.2 billion; upland cotton, $861 million; and rice, $568
million.
   In addition to the deficiency payments, farmers also can qualify
in some cases for ``diversion'' payments to remove additional land
from crop production. For 1987, those are expected to total more
than $1.6 billion, including: corn, $1.44 billion; sorghum, $137
million; barley, $31 million; and oats, $8 million.
   There were no diversion payments for wheat, cotton and rice.

   Women who bear premature babies can provide
more milk for their infants by not smoking during lactation,
according to an Agriculture Department scientist.
   Physiologist Judy M. Hopkinson said she instructed mothers who
delivered babies eight to 12 weeks early to empty both breasts at
least six times a day. She said 23 of the non-smoking mothers, or
80 percent, maintained enough milk after the infants went home. But
only three of the 11 mothers who smoked, or 27 percent, continued
to produce enough milk.
   Hopkinson works at the department's Children's Nutrition
Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Her
findings were reported here Thursday by the department's
Agricultural Research Service.
   In non-smokers, low milk production is usually due to ``mothers
not pumping their breasts enough,'' she said. ``Generally, it's not
a physiological problem.''
   But ``smokers have significantly lower milk volume than
non-smokers,'' Hopkinson said. The 11 smokers averaged 11 percent
less milk during the first two weeks after giving birth and 40
percent less by the fourth week.
   The infants have to be tube fed because they are too immature to
suck and swallow, and ``mothers want to give them their milk,'' she
said. ``It's one of the few things they can do, and it's a very
emotional issue.''
   But many women who deliver prematurely are not getting the
appropriate information to produce enough milk, Hopkinson said.
Most of the mothers can increase milk production by pumping more
frequently. Five times a day is enough to maintain volume, she
said, and eight to 10 times a day will increase milk volume within
a week or two.
   Hopkinson said mother's milk is preferred over formula or donor
milk because it is more suited to the infant and may also enhance
the infant's immunity to infections. Even so, she said, for very
low-birthweight babies, mother's milk must be fortified with extra
protein and minerals, including calcium and phosphorous.

<HEAD>Doctors: Don't Swallow Your Toothbrush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many have brushed, but only a few have swallowed.
   So say researchers who scrutinized medical literature and found
exactly 31 cases in all recorded history of people somehow managing
to swallow their toothbrushes.
   Four of those incidents occurred in Durham, N.C., in recent
years, Dr. Allan D. Kirk of Duke University Medical Center and
colleagues reported in the March issue of the Archives of Surgery.
   Two of the North Carolina swallowers apparently had drunk a
large quantity of alcohol, while a third was a 60-year-old woman
who had a seizure while brushing her teeth. She complained only of
throat pain but examination revealed the brush stuck in the
esophagus and it was removed with forceps.
   The fourth victim was a 20-year-old woman who developed a
violent coughing spell while brushing her teeth. The brush made its
way to her stomach and surgeons snared it with a wire dropped down
through her mouth.
   Despite the unusual cluster in Durham, ``This problem should
probably not be considered endemic to this part of North
Carolina,'' the researchers wrote.
   The other reports of toothbrush swallowing in this country are
isolated with one each in San Francisco, Tennessee and Louisiana.
   One region in India reported six such swallowings between 1960
and 1973.
   The champion toothbrush swallower of all time was a Soviet
psychiatric patient who ate 16 of them in 1984.
   Most toothbrush swallowing has been accomplished in recent
years, although the earliest reported case was in 1882 in Hong Kong.
   In times past, swallowing knives was in.
   In 1602, for example, Florian Mathis, a German barber-surgeon,
removed a knife from the stomach of a 36-year-old knife swallower
who had something go wrong with his trick.
   In fact, the researchers said, knives were the only foreign
bodies reported removed from the stomach for 207 years. Then people
started doing it with forks and spoons, too.
   But perhaps the No. 1 champion swallower of all times was a
mental patient who had 2,533 objects removed from his stomach in
1927.

<TEXT>
   ``Big Ike'' may stand in the way of
progress, but owners Bill and Dewayne Davis figure the aging,
100-foot giant pecan tree is worth a campaign to keep the chainsaws
at bay.
   ``You can put your arm around six times before you meet
yourself,'' said Dewayne Davis.
   The tree is in danger of being cut down as part of a project to
expand U.S. 45 in northern Mississippi.
   To save their tree, the Davis brothers and a growing number of
supporters are waging a campaign that already includes a ``Big
Ike'' newsletter and ``Save Big Ike'' T-shirts.
   Ike, which has an average limb span of 84 feet, is located on 88
acres owned by Bill, of Olive Branch, and Dwayne, of Richmond, Va.,
on the west side of U.S. 45 three miles south of Corinth.
   The Mississippi Highway Department is widening the highway from
two to four lanes and needs six acres of the brothers' land.
   ``On that six acres sits what is arguably the fifth or sixth
largest pecan tree of its kind in the world,'' said Dewayne.
   Forestry experts say they are not sure if ``Big Ike'' is a
record tree, but they agree that it is among the largest of its
kind. The tree is on the Mississippi Forestry Commission's list of
the state's largest pecan trees, and Mississippi historically has
some of the nation's largest pecan trees.
   Dewayne Davis said the tree also had sentimental value.
   ``I was born under that tree, in a house right below the tree,''
he said. ``I ran into that tree the first time I rode a bicycle.''
   Davis said he had met with representatives of the highway
department and that officials were attempting to work with him.
   ``There are no villains,'' he said.
   Davis said that as part of his campaign, he wrote letters to
various officials and contacted an area newapaper.
   ``That cut loose a real groundswell of support,'' he said.
   He said he had received calls and letters offering support, and
a fourth-grade class at Kossuth Elementary School adopted the tree.
Davis said he forwarded the information to Gov. Ray Mabus, who owns
a tree farm, and began sending out the newsletters and the T-shirts.
   Puckett Wilson of the governor's staff, a self-proclaimed ``tree
fanatic,'' said the governor will ``do anything within reason'' to
save the tree.
   ``I think it's going to come out happy,'' said Davis.

   What was to have been U.S. Rep. Pat
Swindall's dream house has turned into a political albatross,
dripping with threatened lawsuits and leaving the congressman
battling suggestions of money-laundering.
   Swindall designed the 12,500-square-foot house for him and his
wife, Kimberly, near Stone Mountain State Park.
   ``The ultimate irony is I started out wanting to build a log
cabin,'' said the Republican congressman.
   Nine subcontractors have filed liens against the property, and
Swindall has appeared before a federal grand jury investigating an
accused money launderer who once lent the congressman money.
   Swindall, a lawyer, has tried to stay out of court over the
thousands of dollars in contested bills and said he has asked his
pastor and his general contractor's pastor to help him resolve the
dispute.
   ``There is a route you ought to follow that is biblically
prescribed in Matthew 18,'' said Swindall. ``First, you confront
the person alone, which I've done, and he denied everything.
Secondly, you take them before their church, which I intend to do.
I don't think Christians ought to be suing other Christians.''
   The three-story mansion, built on 13 heavily wooded acres and
overlooking a small lake, has seven bedrooms, 7{ bathrooms, a
mother-in-law suite, a swimming pool, a tennis court and a
three-car garage.
   The size and cost of the house was made an issue by Ben Jones, a
Democrat who nearly upset Swindall's 1986 re-election bid. Jones
said it was built at cut rates by John Sauers, a political
supporter tied to the religious right.
   Swindall, 37, laughs at hints of a ``sweetheart deal'' from
Sauers, his general contractor, because the two and numerous
subcontractors are feuding over unpaid bills.
   Swindall blames Sauers for delays, poor workmanship and cost
overruns that he said tacked $300,000 to the price of the house.
Their contract was an oral, cost-plus-10-percent agreement that
gave Sauers unlimited access to Swindall's construction account,
the congressman said.
   Swindall claims Sauers, whom he fired in November, failed to pay
subcontractors and used the congressman's credit to buy supplies
for other projects.
   Sauers denies the charges and says he built Swindall a fine
home. The house costs ``were extremely fair,'' he said, adding that
Swindall's claims of shoddy work ``is like telling Van Gogh he
can't paint or Michaelangelo he can't sculpt.''
   Rusty Johnson, a Smyrna flooring contractor, is among the
subcontractors who say the congressman owes them money.
   ``You try to pay your taxes then your damn local congressman
don't pay you,'' said Johnson, who says Swindall owes him $5,395.
He said he rejected an offer from Swindall to settle at 50 cents on
the dollar.
   Swindall said the cost overruns led him to borrow $150,000 from
former Atlanta businessman Charles LeChasney, indicted in January
on federal money-laundering charges.
   While seeking a permanent home loan last fall, Swindall said, he
negotiated an interim construction loan from LeChasney but returned
the $150,000 check after becoming suspicious of him.
   Swindall voluntarily testified about the loan before a federal
grand jury last month.
   The congressman admits to ``poor judgment'' in some dealings
with Sauers but blames part of his predicament on ``placing too
much responsibility on my wife.''
   The house ``was my wife's project,'' he said.

<HEAD>Panel Approves Increase in Minimum Wage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to raise the federal minimum wage
from $3.35 an hour to $4.65 over the next three years has won House
subcommittee approval, but organized labor failed in a bid to tie
future increases to inflation.
   With voting along strict party lines, the Democratic-controlled
House labor standards subcommittee approved the bill on Thursday.
The full House Education and Labor Committee plans to take up the
measure next week.
   Subcommittee Chairman Austin J. Murphy, D-Pa., said the current
minimum of $3.35 an hour ``no longer provides the same level of
opportunity to improve one's life that it once did.''
   ``Our actions here today represent a step in the right
direction,'' he said. ``An increase in the minimum wage will
certainly help many low-wage workers achieve a measure of dignity.''
   Organized labor supports the legislation, while the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce and the National Restaurant Association oppose any
minimum wage increase.
   The subcommittee approved the legislation 6-3 with all the
Democrats for the measure and all the Republicans opposed.
Democrats earlier defeated several Republican-sponsored amendments
either to water down the legislation or kill it outright.
   One amendment, sponsored by Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., would
have increased the minimum just 65 cents over the next three years.
It was rejected on party lines.
   However, labor did not gain all it had been seeking over the
past year. The subcommittee, on a motion by Timothy J. Penny,
D-Minn., refused on a 7-2 vote to tie future increases to inflation.
   Penny said he was ``concerned about something like this being on
automatic pilot. Congress should review any future increases.''
   He also said automatic increases in the minimum wage could lead
to higher inflation.
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the full
committee, disputed that argument, saying ``wages lag behind
inflation and will always do so as long as they are based on past
experience.''
   A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Education Committee.
The panel has held hearings but has not placed the measure on its
business agenda yet.

<HEAD>Supporters Say Senate Bill Would Benefit Customers Through
Competition</HEAD>

   Legislation broadening the power of banks to
enter the securities industry but narrowing their opportunities to
offer insurance would offer a mixed bag to consumers of financial
services.
   The provisions are contained in a bill passed late Wednesday by
the Senate Banking Committee. The bill, which must go before the
full Senate, dismantles most of the barriers between commercial and
investment banking in place since the Depression.
   Supporters say businesses and state and local governments would
pay lower underwriting fees because of added competition in the
securities business. They say individual investors would pay lower
mutual fund fees for the same reason.
   Home buyers could save as much as $1,000 on a $100,000 mortgage,
says Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the committee and
the bill's sponsor.
   Consumer groups are also hailing a section, sponsored by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., that provides new safeguards on home
equity loans.
   But limits on bank involvement in insurance, also sponsored by
Dodd, could hamper competition in that field, they say.
   Despite the lopsided 18-2 vote by the Senate committee,
signaling almost certain passage in the full Senate, similar bills
in the House face more uncertain prospects. There, jurisdiction
over the issue is shared by the Energy and Commerce and the Banking
committees.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
has expressed great skepticism about allowing banks too many new
powers.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the finance
subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has said he
favors phasing in new powers for banks so federal regulatory
agencies aren't swamped.
   ``It is essential that Congress link the introduction of new
powers to regulatory preparedness,'' he said in a statement
Thursday.
   The home equity loan section of the Proxmire bill requires
lenders to disclose the interest rate on loans in a clear and
uniform manner as well as closing costs and repayment terms. It
also would prohibit lenders from unilaterally changing the terms of
a home equity line of credit after the contract is signed.
   Michelle Meier, an attorney for the Consumer's Union, and Leslie
Gainer of U.S. PIRG, a group associated with consumer activist
Ralph Nader, said in a statement that the Proxmire version is an
improvement over a similar home equity bill in the House, which
does not bar unilateral changes.
   Another section would make it easier for consumers to shop for a
place to put their money by requiring banks and mutual funds to
advertise in a uniform manner the interest rate paid on deposits
and money market accounts.
   Under the bill, banks would get immediate power to underwrite
mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper and municipal revenue
bonds.
   They would be able to deal in mutual funds and corporate bonds
six months after enactment. But, in a concession to the securities
industry, banks would not be allowed to underwrite corporate stock
_ viewed by senators as the riskiest securities area _ unless
Congress authorizes that in a separate vote early in 1991.
   On insurance, the bill permits state officials to authorize
state-chartered banks and bank holding companies to underwrite
insurance within their home states. But they will not be able to
sell insurance outside their home state. And the bill would close
loopholes that permit some national banks to sell insurance.

<HEAD>Carter Says He And Family Still Need Secret Service Protection</HEAD>

   Former President Jimmy Carter says he and his
family would be in danger if Secret Service protection stopped
under legislation that a senator says would end the era of the
``imperial former presidency.''
   Elimination of security ``would make it almost impossible for us
to live a normal private life at home free of uninvited visitors,
to attend major events if our attendance is publicized, or to
travel to many places in our country or abroad,'' Carter said in a
letter to Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla.
   He said there were frequent occasions when people have come to
his hometown of Plains, Ga., and threatened him or his family with
bodily harm.
   Last fall, he said, there were three such incidents within a
month. In one case, he continued, the visitor shattered the large
glass reflector mirrors and tried to destroy the gate leading to
his driveway.
   ``There is no way to anticipate when one of them could be
serious,'' wrote Carter.
   Carter's letter and letters from former presidents Gerald R.
Ford and Richard M. Nixon were made public Thursday in a hearing by
Chiles' Senate Government Operations subcommittee.
   Ford said he can do without the federal protection, and Nixon
gave up his government security in 1985.
   Chiles and 14 others have sponsored legislation that would end
Secret Service protection of former presidents and their families
five years after they leave office. The bill also would place a
limit on their office and staff expenses and would phase out
funding entirely after 10 years.
   Secret Service protection could be extended beyond the five-year
period if the Treasury secretary demonstrated a need for continued
protection.
   ``The American people want former presidents to live a dignified
retired life as an elder statesman, free from any real danger, one
free from the need to commercialize _ to huckster _ the office of
the presidency,'' Chiles said. ``But the programs were left
open-ended. Things have gotten out of hand.''
   He said Secret Service protection for Ford and Carter and their
families cost $8 million in 1986. In Nixon's last year of 1985,
federal protection cost some $3 million for him.
   Ford told Chiles that he favored enactment of the legislation. A
Nixon aide, John H. Taylor, said Nixon voluntarily gave up the
lifetime federal protection in August 1985 and Mrs. Nixon did so in
1984, thus saving the government $3 million annually. ``He believed
it was no longer appropriate for the taxpayers to bear the cost of
his security,'' wrote Taylor.
   Michael Endicott, a Secret Service agent for 20 years who now is
in charge of security for Nixon, said Secret Service protection
often limits the recipient's freedom of movement. He said he has
never felt Nixon's safety has been threatened since he began to
handle his security, traveling to cities around the world and
attending sporting and other public events.
   ``At most of these events, we usually sit in the general public
seats, even though VIP boxes are usually available,'' he said.
``There is more privacy with fewer people. We are able to go to
more ball games now than when he had Secret Service protection.''
   The big difference, he said, is that the Secret Service must
``protect against the potential threat, while I can protect from
the actual threat.''
   Endicott said he believes there should be a time limit on the
Secret Service protection but feels that the federal government
``should continue to be responsible for their protection.''
   ``I believe the government should provide funding to the former
president so that they can manage their own day-to-day security,''
he said.
   Carter asked that ``an adequate level of security'' be
continued. However, he said, he would not object if Secret Service
experts could reduce the level and cost of his protection.
   ``There is a need for a security or law enforcement presence
around a former president that naturally flows from occupying the
most important office in the country,'' he said. ``To finance one's
own security force, however modest, is a very expensive matter,
though some of our former high-level officials have chosen to do
so.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Front-Running Bush Says South Carolina Sets The
Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   While Vice President George Bush spoke from
the steps of the Kershaw County Courthouse, his campaign manager
was telling reporters how easily Bush could withstand a loss in
Saturday's South Carolina Republican presidential primary.
   Not many people expect Bush to lose to either Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole or former television evangelist Pat Robertson. Two recent
polls said Bush was running well ahead of Dole in this state, with
Robertson in third place. Rep. Jack Kemp was far behind.
   But the South Carolina vote comes three days before Super
Tuesday, the day 20 states hold primaries or caucuses, most of them
in the South or bordering the region.
   ``South Carolina is going to set the pace,'' Bush told the crowd
gathered on the courthouse lawn.
   Lee Atwater, a native of this Southern state, is a master of
political spin and he was determined to plant the Bush campaign
view of things with reporters.
   ``The stakes are extremely high on everybody else,'' he said.
   ``Robertson has said over and over again that he's going to win
and if he doesn't win here I don't see anywhere else he could
win,'' said the Bush aide.
   As for Dole, he has the support of Sen. Strom Thurmond, the most
popular Republican in the state, said Atwater, so if Dole can't
beat Bush in South Carolina, where can he beat him three days later
on Super Tuesday?
   A Bush loss on Saturday?
   ``It would not be good,'' said Atwater. But not all that
devastating either, he says.
   ``You've got Dole, who's got no organization as far as I can
tell, anywhere in the South, he's not running on TV in a lot of the
states and he's way behind in the polls,'' he went on. ``No one is
in a position to capitalize if something does happen.''
   One secret of Atwater's success putting spin on political events
is that there always is a measure of truth in what he says.
   While he tries to minimize the impact of a Bush loss, he's
probably right about the thinness of the Dole organization in the
South.
   It also is hard to argue with his contention that if Robertson
can't win in South Carolina, he can't win anywhere.
   The night the New Hampshire votes were counted, Robertson, who
finished last in the northern New England state, said the race was
moving into his back yard and he flatly predicted he'd beat Bush
and Dole in South Carolina.
   The state's primary seemed tailor-made for Robertson. The state
has a large fundamentalist Christian community and there are no
barriers to Democrats who want to vote in the GOP primary. Many of
Robertson's supporters are Democrats.
   But as polls began to come out showing Bush with a solid lead in
the state, Robertson toned down his optimism.
   ``I have a tremendous uphill fight against George Bush,'' said
the former host of the television's ``700 Club.'' ``He's way, way
ahead of me in the polls.''
   Atwater is cautious in assessing Robertson's showing in the
polls, however.
   ``You just can't judge the Robertson factor in the polls,'' he
said.
   Thurmond's backing and active campaigning gave Dole a boost in
the state. A victory on Saturday or a strong second would revive
Dole's prospects in the region where he is considered weakest.
   On the other hand, if the Kansas senator finishes third, it
would seem to confirm his weakness in the South.
   South Carolina is another conservative state where Kemp hoped to
find a large enough constituency to establish himself as the
conservative-wing alternative to Bush and Dole. But here as
elsewhere, Robertson stood in his way and there seems little
likelihood that the New York congressman will have any breakthrough.
   A last-place finish for Kemp would be the end of the line _
whether or not he stays in the race.

<HEAD>Element Of Truth In Both Gephardt's Charge And Dukakis' Denial</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In campaign sparring, Rep. Richard Gephardt has
accused Democratic rival Gov. Michael Dukakis of taxing average
families to close a state budget deficit. Dukakis, for his part,
claims he has cut a record amount in taxes.
   Both men have a point.
   Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts for nine of the past 13
years, has served the state as chief executive in the best and
worst of times. In that period, the state has increased taxes by
about $500 million and cut taxes in a series of steps by more than
$700 million.
   As governor, Dukakis signed all those measures. Some he
initiated, some he merely tolerated and some he resisted.
   In a campaign debate Monday night, Dukakis criticized Gephardt
for his 1981 federal tax bill vote, saying the ``Iowa Gephardt''
soft-pedaled that vote.
   Gephardt shot back, asking ``What about the Massachusetts
Dukakis that raised taxes on average families?''
   Dukakis responded by saying he had ``cut taxes five times in the
last four years.''
   But Gephardt persisted: ``Why did you raise taxes on average
families in 1974?''
   In fact, Massachusetts did raise taxes under Dukakis in 1975,
when Dukakis took office from a Republican governor and inherited a
$530 million deficit in a $4 billion budget.
   The deficit forced Dukakis to go back on the ``lead-pipe''
guarantee he made in his 1974 campaign not to raise taxes. Acting
with the Legislature, Dukakis borrowed $450 million to close the
gap and put through $110 million in ``sin'' taxes and another $350
million in a surcharge on the state's 5 percent income tax.
   Dukakis also imposed drastic cuts in social spending, which
balanced the budget but which are widely blamed for costing him the
governorship in 1978, when he was defeated by conservative Democrat
Edward J. King. One of King's top advisers, Edward Reilly, is now a
Gephardt strategist.
   Since Dukakis returned to office in 1983, state taxes have been
reduced by more than $700 million, according to Frank Keefe,
Dukakis' secretary of administration and finance. Keefe also notes
that Massachusetts has seen its bond rating improve and the cost of
state and local government fall to near the bottom of national
rankings.
   ``I think the governor deserves the reputation of being the
biggest tax-cutter in the history of the commonwealth _ a record I
don't think will be matched in two generations,'' Keefe said.
   Dukakis does, however, have bitter detractors in Massachusetts.
Prominent among them is Barbara Anderson, executive director of
Citizens for Limited Taxation, a tax-fighting group that has been
supplying ammunition against Dukakis to the rival campaigns of
Gephardt and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   Anderson said in an interview that if tax cuts are defined as
any reductions Dukakis signed, ``then you'd have a wash.''
   But she argues that Dukakis has consistently resisted tax cuts
over the years and proposed only minor ones. She notes that Dukakis
opposed Proposition 2{, the 1980 ballot question that limited local
property taxes, although she does not note that virtually every
politician did.
   Her group's list of grievances against Dukakis also includes
keeping the income tax surcharge for 10 years, advocating a
graduated state income tax in 1976, increasing the capital gains
tax in 1983, proposing $300 million in business taxes to fund an
infrastructure bank, vetoing a tax cut for senior citizens and
pushing for a ``unitary'' tax on multistate corporations.
   But CLT's biggest complaint involves a protracted, complex
struggle over taxes in 1986 that resulted in repeal of the surtax
and the imposition by the voters of a cap on state revenues.
Anderson claims Dukakis resisted both moves at every turn.
   Richard Manley, head of the non-partisan Massachusetts Taxpayers
Foundation, gives Dukakis more credit.
   ``I think it's fair to say Dukakis has never been
philosophically a guy who wants to cut taxes. But I think it's also
fair to say that the surtax part of the 1975 package hung around
his neck like an albatross,'' Manley said.
   ``He's no pal of mine. But if you look at the thing objectively,
the fact is the (1975) deficit was inherited and somebody had to
pay it,'' he said. ``Did he repeal the surtax? No. The Legislature
did. He went along ... but I don't think it's fair to say in any
way that he's a tax raiser.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. entered his first
``attack ad'' in the Super Tuesday sweepstakes as two of his
Democratic rivals went at each other over a commercial about
corporate contributions.
   The political TV ads heated up and proliferated Thursday in
preparation for the presidential primaries and caucuses next week
in 20 states, most of them in the South.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis sparked a chain reaction with
his new ad challenging Rep. Richard Gephardt's message to the
little people that ``it's your fight, too.''
   The Dukakis ad consists of a rolling list of corporate political
action committees that have contributed to Gephardt's campaign.
``Is Dick Gephardt really fighting your fight, or theirs?'' asks
the narrator.
   Gephardt, who has been running ads criticizing both Dukakis and
Gore for days, staged an airport news conference and blasted
Dukakis for questioning his sincerity and record of fighting for
working people.
   ``I'm very upset about it,'' Gephardt told reporters at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. ``I've never made a
decision in my public life based on (PAC) contributions. Some who
are raising money for me were grievously damaged by (the 1986) tax
reform.''
   Gephardt accused Dukakis of accepting millions from ``special
interests who do business with the state of Massachusetts'' and
said his campaign would release a partial list on Friday.
   ``The Dukakis campaign does not take a dime of corporate PAC
money or any money from a lobbyist registered in the state of
Massachusetts,'' responded Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   Gore introduced a 60-second ad consisting entirely of an excerpt
from a debate last month in Dallas. It is running ``in a great
number of markets in a great number of states,'' said Gore
spokesman Mark Armour.
   The spot shows the Tennessee senator accusing Gephardt of voting
against minimum wage increases, against creating the Department of
Education, for tuition tax credits and for Reaganomics _ and
reversing his positions on all four issues.
   ``The next president of the United States has to be someone the
American people can believe will stay with his convictions. ...
You've got to be willing to stand your ground and be consistent,''
Gore tells Gephardt.
   A Gephardt spokeswoman said the Missouri congressman's campaign
would have no direct response to the Gore ad.
   Negative commercials, dubbed ``attack ads'' by the campaigns,
were the order of the day for the Republican front-runners as well.
Vice President George Bush and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
continued their television attacks on each other in ads that began
earlier in the week.
   A GOP official said he is not worried about the intensity of the
campaign as long as the two keep their advertising accurate.
   ``This is hardball. We're talking high stakes here,'' said Frank
Fahrenkopf, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
   ``I think the tone and rhetoric really in both campaigns has
gotten pretty rough,'' Fahrenkopf told reporters in Boston. But he
added, ``In many ways I've welcomed what's happened. In January I
was concerned with the lack of fire in the belly.''
   Both Bush and Dukakis have stepped up their Super Tuesday media
campaigns in recent days, both in scope and frequency of ads, and
Gore was expected to do the same. ``We intend to outspend the other
Democratic candidates on media in the Super Tuesday states,''
Armour said.

   NATO leaders are looking toward better
relations with the Soviet Union, encouraged by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's new policy of openness but demanding that he back up
his words with deeds.
   ``We are looking beyond pronouncements,'' the Western alliance
said in a final communique that called on the Soviets to respect
human rights and make a ``speedy and complete withdrawal'' of Red
Army troops from Afghanistan.
   The 16 NATO leaders on Thursday wound up their two-day summit,
the first in six years, in a show of solidarity that glossed over
differences on arms issues and applauded superpower efforts to
reduce long-range nuclear weapons.
   President Reagan claimed a mandate for his planned spring summit
in Moscow and said NATO was ``ready to get down to business'' on
strategic arms talks.
   He said the medium-range nuclear weapons treaty signed by the
United States and the Soviet Union last December was ``a direct
result'' of alliance unity.
   The alliance, troubled by a dispute over the modernization of
short-range nuclear missiles in West Germany, sidestepped a direct
confrontation on that issue and produced an upbeat proclamation of
unity.
   The leaders pledged to maintain a nuclear presence in Europe to
deter a Soviet attack, and called for a reduction in Soviet bloc
conventional forces. The West says the Soviet bloc has a
substantial edge in five major ground categories.
   NATO said ``the search for improved and more stable relations
with the Soviet Union and the other countries of Eastern Europe is
among our principal concerns'' and called for efforts to reduce
East-West tensions.
   The statement noted ``encouraging signs of change'' in the
policies of the Soviet Union'' that create ``the prospect for
greater openness in their relations with their own people and with
other nations.''
   ``But we look beyond pronouncements for tangible and lasting
policy changes addressing directly the issues dividing East and
West,'' the communique said.
   ``We agree that the speedy and complete withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan and effective restoration of that country's
sovereignty would be of major significance. It is against these
criteria that we shall assess General Secretary Gorbachev's recent
statements,'' the statement said.
   The NATO leaders were united in their assessment of the alliance
and its goals.
   ``We're strong, we're united, we're prosperous and we're free,''
said Reagan.
   Underscoring NATO's commitment to keep nuclear weapons in
Europe, he said, ``All of us understand the absolute necessity of
maintaining the credibility of our deterrent.''
   ``There is no doubt whatsoever that the agenda we have set now
is the right one for NATO,'' said British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   French President Francois Mitterand said ``this is one more step
toward disarmament, with all the necessary precautions.''
   The harmony of the meeting had been threatened by West Germany's
reluctance to replace older short-range nuclear weapons with newer,
more effective ones.
   Most of these weapons, if fired, would hit German soil, East or
West, and the modernization campaign has inflamed disarmament
passions in West Germany.
   In a compromise, the communique avoided use of the word
modernization, to which West Germany objects. Instead, the document
said NATO will maintain ``an appropriate mix of adequate and
effective nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to be
kept up to date where necessary.''
   NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington said the word
modernization _ perhaps because of translation problems _ ``means
in the minds of a number of people in different countries in Europe
the introduction of new and more terrible and more destructive
weapons.''
   However, he said it was more likely that the new weapons would
be ``more accurate and may very well be of less destructive power.''

   Malaysia plans to ban people under
21 years old from nightclubs, bars and pool halls in Kuala Lumpur,
Prime Minister Suleiman Mohamad said today.
   Suleiman told reporters the age limit was being raised from 18
to maintain a good social image for the capital.
   Legislation was being proposed to impose the ban, he said.
   Suleiman said entertainment centers would be fined about $200 if
they allow in underage customers, and the youths would be fined a
similar amount if caught.

of the NATO summit.

<HEAD>A Time For Reaffirmation</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   We, the representatives of the 16 members of the North Atlantic
Alliance, have come together to re-emphasize our unity, to assess
the current state of East-West relations, to review the
opportunities and challenges which lie ahead, and in so doing:
   _To reaffirm the common ideals and purposes which are the
foundation of our partnership;
   _To rededicate ourselves to the principles and provisions of the
Washington Treaty of 1949;
   _To reassert the vital importance of the alliance for our
security, and the validity of our strategy for peace. ...
   The security in freedom and the prosperity of the European and
North American allies are inextricably linked. The long-standing
commitment of the North American democracies to the preservation of
peace and security in Europe is vital.
   The presence in Europe of conventional and nuclear forces of the
United States provides the essential linkage with the United States
strategic deterrent, and, together with the forces of Canada, is a
tangible expression of that commitment. This presence must and will
be maintained.
   Likewise, a free, independent and increasingly united Europe is
vital to North America's security. The credibility of allied
defense cannot be maintained without a major European contribution.
We therefore welcome recent efforts to reinforce the European
pillar of the Alliance, intended to strengthen the transatlantic
partnership and Alliance security as a whole.
   The Atlantic alliance cannot be strong if Europe is weak.
   Our aim will continue to be to prevent any kind of war or
intimidation. By maintaining credible deterrence the alliance has
secured peace in Europe for nearly 40 years.
   Conventional defenses alone cannot ensure this; therefore, for
the foreseeable future there is no alternative to the alliance
strategy for the prevention of war. This is a strategy of
deterrence based upon an appropriate mix of adequate and effective
nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to be kept up
to date where necessary.
   While seeking security and stability at lower levels of
armaments, we are determined to sustain the requisite efforts to
ensure the continued viability, credibility and effectiveness of
our conventional and nuclear forces, including the nuclear forces
in Europe, which together provide the guarantee of our common
security.
   Taking into account the structure of the alliance, each of us
undertakes to play his part in this joint endeavor in a spirit of
solidarity, reaffirming our willingness to share fairly the risks,
burdens and responsibilities as well as the benefits of our common
efforts. ...
   We want gradually to overcome the unnatural division of the
European continent, which affects most directly the German people.
We will continue to uphold the freedom and viability of Berlin and
to support efforts to improve the situation there.
   The search for improved and more stable relations with the
Soviet Union and the other countries of Eastern Europe is among our
principal concerns. We call upon these countries to work with us
for a further relaxation of tensions, greater security at lower
levels of arms, more extensive human contacts and increased access
to information. We will continue the effort to expand cooperation
with the East wherever and whenever this is of mutual benefit.
   We have noted encouraging signs of change in the policies of the
Soviet Union and some of its allies. This creates the prospect for
greater openness in their relations with their own people and with
other nations. ... But we look beyond pronouncements for tangible
and lasting policy changes addressing directly the issues dividing
East and West.
   However, we have to date witnessed no relaxation of the military
effort pursued for years by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union
persists in deploying far greater military forces than are required
for its defence. This massive force, which the Soviet Union has not
refrained from using outside its borders, as is still the case in
Afghanistan, constitutes a fundamental source of tension between
East and West. ...
   Arms control is an integral part of our security policy. We seek
negotiations not for their own sake but to reach agreements which
can significantly reduce the ris of conflict and make a genuine
contribution to stability and peace. ...
   The recently concluded INF agreement between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union is a milestone in our efforts to achieve a more secure
peace and lower levels of arms. ...
   Consistent with their security requirements, the 15 allies
concerned will make use of all possibilities for effectively
verifiable arms control agreements which lead to a stable and
secure balance of forces at a lower level. For them, the
comprehensive concept of arms control and disarmament includes:
   _A 50 percent reduction in the strategic offensive nuclear
weapons of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to be achieved during
current Geneva negotiations.
   _The global elimination of chemical weapons.
   _The establishment of a stable and secure level of conventional
forces, by the elimination of disparities, in the whole of Europe.
   _In conjunction with the establishment of a conventional balance
and the global elimination of chemical weapons, tangible and
verifiable reductions of American and Soviet land-based nuclear
missile systems of shorter range, leading to equal ceilings. ...
   Genuine peace in Europe cannot be established solely by arms
control. It must be firmly based on full respect for fundamental
human rights. As we continue our efforts to reduce armaments, we
shall press for implementation on the part of the governments of
the Soviet Union and of other Eastern countries of all of the
principles and provisions of the Helsinki Final Act and of the
Madrid Concluding document. ...
   We agree that the speedy and complete withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan and effective restoration of that country's
sovereignty would be of major significance. It is against these
criteria that we shall assess General Secretary Gorbachev's recent
statements.
   We hope that at their forthcoming summit in Moscow President
Reagan and General Secretary Gorbachev will be able to build upon
the progress achieved at their Washington meeting last December. We
strongly support the efforts of the United States.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of using lie detectors to screen job
applicants and test employees' honesty have given up hope that
President Reagan will veto legislation outlawing the practice.
   The Senate, by a 69-27 vote, on Thursday joined the House in
approving a bill effectively prohibiting about 85 percent of the
some 2 million polygraph examinations now conducted each year in
the United States.
   Remaining now is only for the House and Senate sponsors of the
ban to iron out minor differences in the two versions, submit the
compromise for passage again and send it to the White House for
Reagan's signature.
   Throughout his first term and even into last year, Reagan had
vowed to veto any legislation to restrict private employers in
their growing use of lie detectors, allegedly to ferret out thieves
and other wrongdoers.
   Labor unions and civil liberties groups argue that the devices
are used just as often to intimidate workers or weed out those with
pro-union sympathies.
   With increasing evidence that the tests in most circumstances
are poorly administered and produce faulty results between 15 and
50 percent of the time, advocates of the ban have worn down much of
the administration's opposition.
   After two days of extended debate this week stalling the Senate
action, opponents of the ban gave up their fight when the
administration released a statement objecting only to portions of
the legislation and avoiding any mention of a veto for the first
time.
   ``The administration does not have the backbone at this time to
veto this bill,'' complained Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind. ``They have
folded up shop, caving like a house of cards.''
   Crafted by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah _ normally adversaries on labor-management issues _ the
Senate bill would allow some private use of polygraphs to
investigate specific incidents of theft or sabotage.
   But even then, the tests would have to be conducted by licensed
examiners under regulations to be developed by the Labor
Department, and employers would first have to file a police report
or insurance claim and detail in writing the basis for suspecting
the employee to be questioned.
   Employees who failed the test or refused to take it under such
circumstances could not be fired absent other evidence. If they
were, the bill allows civil suits against offending employers, and
provides for up to a $10,000 federal fine for each violation.
   Kennedy and Hatch, respectively the chairman and ranking
Republican on the Senate's Labor and Human Resources Committee,
complained that an estimated 320,000 ``honest workers'' are branded
as liars each year, often losing their jobs or being denied one
because of the machines' inaccuracy.
   ``Conversely, it is a regrettable fact that employees steal,''
Hatch said. ``This bill addresses both concerns by barring use of
polygraphs where they are most likely to make a false
identification but permitting the use of these tests where they are
likely to be most accurate.''
   Both House and Senate versions exempt private security guards
and Kennedy said Thursday that Senate negotiators are likely to go
along with the House in extending the exemption to employees of
pharmaceutical companies as well.
   He said he expects to meet with Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont, the
primary author of the House version passed by a 254-158 vote last
November, within the next two weeks to begin hammering out a
compromise.
   ``They ban about 90 percent and we ban about 85 percent,''
Kennedy said, predicting the new prohibition will become law before
the end of the year ``with or without the president's support.''
   Hatch credited the United Food and Commercial Workers union and
its president, William Wynn, for crafting the language that allows
use of lie detectors to investigate specific instances of
``economic loss.''
   With that provision, absent in the House bill, several business
groups representing railroads, bankers, restaurants, brokerage
houses, grocers and other retail merchants dropped their opposition.
   The only major opponents that remained were the polygraph
industry itself, the American Trucking Associations and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
   ``We've found them to be reliable and cost-effective,
particularly in pre-employment screening,'' said Roger Middleton,
chief counsel for corporate policy at the Chamber of Commerce.
``This is just an inconsistent attempt by the federal government to
address a state problem.''
   However, the UFCW's Wynn said the large margin by which the
Senate passed the bill reflects a recognition that the devices are
little more than ``the 20th century's equivalent of the dunking
stool.''

   The Commerce Department turns 75 today, just
four years older than the man who runs it, C. William Verity. And
Verity claims to be ``a late bloomer'' just like the once-staid
agency he heads.
   ``Even as a late bloomer, you can come into the scene and be a
player,'' Verity said in an interview in his ballroom-size office
built in the late 1920s to the specifications of one of the early
commerce secretaries, Herbert Hoover.
   The oldest Cabinet member at 71, the retired chairman of Armco
steel is still five years younger than his boss in the White House.
Verity arrived on the scene in October, about the time top-echelon
members of the administration plan their returns to the private
sector.
   Still, Verity's brief tenure has been marked by activism and
some measure of controversy.
   There have been trade skirmishes with Japan, turf squabbles with
other agencies and resignations of several top officials. Verity's
outspoken advocacy of closer economic ties with the Soviet Union
has drawn criticism from both conservatives in Congress and from
some Jewish organizations.
   The agency has come a long way from its creation in 1913 when
its main functions included counting the population, inspecting
steamboats and maintaining lighthouses.
   Today, the department enforces U.S. trade policy, probably its
most vital role in a day of $170 billion trade deficits. It also
collects and analyzes economic data and serves as home for the
Census Bureau, the National Weather Service, the Bureau of
Standards and a host of other agencies.
   It serves, now as in the past, as the business community's
advocate within the halls of government.
   Verity had retired in 1982 as chairman and chief executive
officer of Armco, then based in Ohio. The retirement ended when he
was picked by President Reagan to head the sprawling agency after
the death last summer of Malcolm Baldrige, who had been commerce
secretary since 1981.
   Baldrige, who was extremely popular with the agency's 38,000
employes and members of Congress, died in a freak rodeo accident.
   Although under Baldrige the Commerce Department had been the
lead federal agency on dealing with Congress on trade legislation,
Verity has moved into other areas and pressed ahead with his own
pet projects.
   One has been more fully automating the department's many
activities. Another was pressing for commercializaton of space _ an
effort Verity said gave him a quick lesson in heading a government
agency since it brought him into conflict with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``NASA doesn't want anybody else out there,'' he said.
   ``I think you find out you're not in charge,'' he said. ``There
are a lot of people who have a piece of the action who have to get
on board. The mission in private business is to get something done.
In government, it's to move toward solving a problem, but to get
everybody on board with you as you try to solve it.''
   ``And that just requires a lot of time and a lot of massaging of
people's feelings and testing this and testing that.''
   He said his present priority is a program to help smaller
companies export more.
   ``I think our economy is going to be export-driven this year,''
he said. ``Our department feels we should do whatever we can to
encourage small and medium sized companies to get into the export
game.''
   His no-nonsense approach, particularly his tough stance toward
Japan, has won him a lot of fans in the business community. Just a
few days on the job, Verity threatened Japan with retaliation if it
didn't do more to open its markets or adjust its prices to match
the lower dollar.
   While Japanese officials protested, the tough talk from a man
who speaks softly and slowly won him fans among U.S. industries
battered by Japanese imports.
   ``Other secretaries and other U.S. spokesmen have not been
urging the government to start speaking in plain language to these
guys (the Japanese),'' said Richard Muller, a Washington
representative for Chrysler Corp.
   Verity also delighted conservationists by recommending sanctions
against Japan last month for the killing of minke whales in
violation of international whaling regulations.
   But, sighed Verity: ``I never had any idea I would be in charge
of whales some day. And I had no idea it would take so much of my
time.''

   A black student activist at the University of Pennsylvania was
under 24-hour protection Thursday after receiving a death threat,
and an all-white fraternity was banned from campus for hiring two
black strippers for a party.
   Earlier Thursday, about 300 people rallied at Dartmouth College
in a protest against bigotry.
   The threat was made against Conrad Tillard, director of the
Organization of Black Consciousness, which had called for the
ouster of the primarily Jewish fraternity Zeta Beta Tau from the
Ivy League school in Philadelphia.
   The university had charged that black strippers at a ZBT party
in September danced naked with a prospective freshman pledge before
a jeering audience shouting racial epithets.
   The threatening letter was sent to a reporter at the school
newspaper, the Daily Pennsylvanian. The writer claimed to be a
student member of the Jewish Defense League.
   However, school officials said they do not believe the writer is
a student, and the JDL denied any connection with the threat.
   Tillard will receive round-the-clock protection by campus police
``as long as it necessary,'' said security spokeswoman Sylvia
Canada.
   Police said they were investigating the letter. The FBI also
said they have received the letter but declined comment.
   ``The main thing it said was that I was a target on their hit
list,'' Tillard said. ``It also said that in general they're trying
to stop the rise of this black power group that I'm helping bring
about.''
   In Hanover, N.H., the rally was sparked by a conservative
off-campus student newspaper's criticism of a black professor's
teaching ability and his music course. The night before, about 200
people held a candlelight march.
   Members of Dartmouth's Afro-American organized the protests
aimed at The Dartmouth Review. Four Review staff members are
charged by the school with harassing the professor, William Cole,
after confronting him in his classroom over the article.
   At the rally, music professor John Appleton defended his
colleague, saying, ``We must find a away to put an end to Jim Crow,
to jingoism, to sexism and to just plain ignorance that the Review
seeks to foster on this campus.''
   On Monday, demonstrators at a Penn rally sponsored by the
Organization of Black Consciousness had called for the ouster from
campus of a ZBT, which was charge by the university with lewdness,
indecent exposure and hazing.
   Late Thursday, the 112-member fraternity announced that it had
been banned from campus until at least the fall of 1989.
   The threatening letter did not mention the fraternity incident,
Tillard said.
   ``The racial tension on the campus has been very, very high for
a long time,'' said Jacqueline Wade, director of Penn's
Afro-American Studies department. ``This is just one indicator of
the level. It's part of a larger whole of racism on this campus.''
   Penn spokesman Bill Epstein said university officials believe
the death threat was written by a Penn student. ``We've checked
around,'' said Epstein. ``There's no sign of the JDL.''
   Mordechai Levey, international director of the New York-based
JDL, said that several Jews on campus were affilitated with the
organization but that the JDL played no role in the threat.
   Rabbi Howard Alperg, director of the Jewish Campus Activities
Board, called the ZBT incident deplorable but added: ``To claim
that it is now a Jewish-black issue is also deplorable.''
   ``There are black radicals who are trying to turn it into a
black-Jewish issue,'' Alperg said. ``That is perceived by Jewish
students as being anti-Semitic.''
   Relationships between black and Jewish students were strained in
1986 during a confrontation over attempts by the Black Student
Unity Conference to have Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan
give a speech.
   Farrakhan did not speak; his organization said it was not
satisfied with the security arrangements.
   On Wednesday, minority students at Hampshire College in Amherst,
Mass., ended their nine-day occupation of a dormitory office after
administrators signed a 16-point agreement aimed at encouraging
racial harmony.

   Two large holes opened up in a road in
eastern England, swallowing a double-decker bus and prompting the
evacuation of a small hotel and nearby homes, police said.
   Authorities believe the road near the city of Norwich was built
above an abandoned 19th century chalk mine.
   One hole opened under the rear of the bus Thursday and the
driver ordered the 20 passengers off the vehicle immediately, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported. But as the driver tried to
pull away, the hole grew into a 26-foot-wide gap and another hole
appeared nearby.
   The television report showed the bus with its rear in the hole
and its front wheels in the air.
   Chief Inspector David Cushing of Norwich police said city
authorities ordered the evacuation of the hotel and nearby homes as
the holes grew larger. Underground gas, electricitry and domestic
water supplies were disrupted.
   The evacuated people spent the night at a school as workmen
attempted repairs.

   South Korea plans to send a buying
mission to the United States in May as part of its effort to ease
growing trade frictions with Washington, government and industry
officials said today.
   The mission, to be headed by Nam Duck-woo, president of the
Korea Foreign Trade Association, will tour various U.S. cities for
15 days to purchase machinery and other industrial products, the
officials said.
   Officials did not give details of the mission's itinerary or

   The United States has pressured South Korea to open its markets
wider to American products to cut its growing trade surplus. The
United States ran a trade deficit of $9.5 billion with South Korea
last year.

<TEXT>
   The House has killed its Democratic
leadership's proposal for a package of ``humanitarian'' aid for the
Nicaraguan Contras, leaving the vacillating U.S. policy toward
Central America once again in limbo and the rebels without support.
   The lawmakers voted 216-208 Thursday to reject the Democrats'
$30.5 million proposal that would have provided four months' worth
of food, clothing and medical supplies to the rebels and created a
new $14 million program to aid children who are victims of the
Nicaraguan civil war.
   Forty-five Democrats, mostly liberals who oppose any aid to the
Contras, joined with Republicans, who thought the aid proposal too
weak, to deal it a fatal blow. Only five of 176 GOP members present
voted for the measure on the final ballot.
   The vote showed the difficulty of coming up with any kind of
agreement on the contentious issue. It was a particular setback for
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who had sought to keep the
Contras in place in Nicaragua to pressure the leftist Sandinista
government into concessions as part of a regional peace process.
Democrats had hoped, too, that their milder aid package would
relieve pressure to give the rebels more weapons later this year.
   But the surprise outcome also appeared to dim any administration
hopes of speedy action to keep supplies flowing to the rebels, who
by some accounts are in dire need of food and other non-lethal
materiel. Previous U.S. aid, and the authority to deliver it by
airdrops inside Nicaragua, expired Tuesday.
   Wright, D-Texas, said the vote may prove ``a somewhat pyrrhic
victory'' for Republicans, adding that he had no immediate plans to
revive a Contra aid plan.
   ``We have thus far done our best,'' Wright said. ``It was as
good an effort as could be made. I don't know how you would find a
better consensus among those who have a sincere effort to help the
peace process.''
   Other Democrats vowed to make any new try for aid difficult.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it ought to be a damned lengthy
process,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., a Contra opponent who is
chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction
over the matter. ``The Republicans sandbagged us.''
   The vote came exactly one month after the House rejected a $36
million Reagan plan to aid the rebels, one which included money for
weapons and other military supplies. Wright won that showdown
partly on the strength of a promise that he would give moderate
members of his party a later chance to vote for a purely
``humanitarian'' aid package.
   ``We fulfilled our commitment to them,'' Wright said after the
vote.
   With no aid plans left before Congress, U.S. policy toward the
Contras _ who were organized seven years ago with U.S. backing _
was in limbo.
   The confusion was illustrated by conflicting reactions to the
vote from President Reagan, the Contras' most prominent supporter,
and a rebel spokeswoman in Miami.
   As he flew back to the United States from a NATO meeting in
Brussels, Belgium, Reagan said: ``I'm very happy.'' His spokesman,
Marlin Fitzwater, later explained that the president meant he was
glad to be able to work on an improved aid package.
   But Contra spokeswoman Marta Sacasa said the rebels had wanted
the aid to pass, and said the United States was turning its back.
   ``Every time the United States turns its back on the Contras, it
puts us in a less favorable position,'' Sacasa said. ``We are
fighting against an enemy that doesn't have these kinds of
problems. The aid from the Soviet Union has not stopped flowing to
the Sandinistas.''
   In drawing up their aid proposal, Democrats led by Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., were faced with the challenge of attracting
support from moderate members, many of them southerners, while not
alienating the party's liberal wing _ most of whom never have
backed the rebels.
   To gain every possible advantage, Democratic leaders had set up
an unusual procedure under which their package would come before
the House as an amendment to a competing but similar Republican
bill. The Democratic version was adopted on a vote of 215 to 210,
thus wiping out the GOP version and replacing it with the
Democratic plan.
   But minutes later, voting on final passage for the same bill, 26
members switched their votes and the entire package was defeated.
The largest group of those abandoning the bill comprised liberal
Democrats who had been uncomfortable voting for it in the first
place.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who led the Republican debate,
said supporters of Contra aid were never given an option they could
support.
   ``This plan didn't do anything,'' he said. ``It was just a
lousy, lousy bill. We were saying we weren't going to vote for it,
and they didn't believe it.''
   One Democratic liberal who said he grudgingly voted for the
package, Rep. George Miller of California, said it would have
helped encourage the peace process in Central America because it
sent ``a renewed message to the Contras that Congress is not
willing to provide lethal aid.''
   But a Contra supporter, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Calif., said the bill
was ``like throwing a bone to the freedom fighters without any meat
on it.''
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the Democratic package represented
``an invitation to a funeral _ a funeral for freedom.'' And if it
passed, Hyde told Democrats, ``you'll have the guilt you deserve:
being accessories to the murder of freedom and democracy in this
hemisphere.''

   Police said they arrested two men late Thursday
in the slaying of a rookie police officer shot at point-blank range
in his patrol car Feb. 26 outside the home of a drug witness he was
guarding.
   The men, whose names were not released, had been picked up
Thursday for questioning along with two women who were later
released, said Officer Peter O'Donnell, a police spokesman.
   Details of the arrests in the slaying of 22-year-old Officer
Edward Byrne will be released Friday, he said.
   Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward had described the slaying as
an ``assassination'' meant to intimidate drug witnesses. Byrne was
killed by shots from a car that had apparently coasted up to his
early in the morning.
   Since the slaying, detectives have flooded the Queens
neighborhood, arresting 256 street-level crack dealers in hopes of
extracting information about the killing.
   ``Shooting at cops, it's just bad for business. I think
experienced criminals know that; perhaps these inexperienced ones
will learn it,'' Ward said.
   The reward for information leading to the conviction of the
killer grew to $130,000 Thursday with a $25,000 contribution from
members of the New York Stock Exchange. More than 10,000 officers
attended Byrne's funeral.
   WNBC-TV reported Wednesday night that investigators identified
two men _ including the gunman _ and two women believed to have
been in the car from which the shots were fired.
   A police spokesman, Capt. Tom Fahey, asked earlier about the
WNBC report, said, ``The case has not been solved. The reward is
still in effect, we still need the cooperation of the community to
help us solve this case.''
   The broadcast report also said police believed the killing was
ordered by Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols, 29, a reputed drug kingpin
sentenced Feb. 25 to 25 years to life in prison for narcotics and
weapons possession.
   He is also awaiting trial on charges he had his parole officer
killed for revenge.

   Nearly every night for the past week and a
half, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. has delivered himself by satellite to
television stations in Super Tuesday states for interviews on local
newscasts.
   The Tennessee Democrat also appeared via satellite for a
campaign pep rally with supporters assembled in more than 50
locations and for a question-and-answer session with students on
more than 100 college campuses.
   ``Everybody is having to do things like this in view of
campaigning in 20 states at the same time,'' said Arlie Schardt, a
spokesman for Gore. ``It's economical and it's the best method of
reaching large numbers of voters.''
   As the approaching Super Tuesday primaries strain campaign
warchests and candidate schedules, satellite ``uplinking'' is being
used by presidential hopefuls to increase their exposure to voters
in the cheapest way possible.
   Though many stations refuse these brief interview opportunities,
the chance for ``live'' time with the candidates has become
attractive to smaller stations in areas where the contenders are
not likely to appear in person.
   But some media experts say the new high-tech tool of the 1988
campaign does not serve the public well.
   ``It plays on the vanity of the local media because everyone
wants to be seen interviewing a presidential candidate, but the
tough questions aren't being asked'' by the local interviewers,
said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the
University of Texas at Austin.
   ``The candidates won't run into any Sam Donaldsons in the 132nd
market,'' said Stephen Hess, senior fellow at the Washington,
D.C.-based Brookings Institution, referring to ABC's tough,
sometimes abrasive White House correspondent.
   Costs for transmitting via satellite vary depending on location
and equipment used, but generally it is far less expensive than
producing and airing an advertisement.
   Airing a 30-second ad on a Boston television station during the
popular Cosby Show program can cost $30,000, while buying 90
minutes of satellite time that can be used for five-minute
interviews by 18 stations costs about $2,000, said Gary Galanis, a
spokesman for Democrat Paul Simon's campaign.
   ``We at this point don't have the resources to buy even a
minimum amount of paid advertising, which would probably be about a
million dollars to hit all the Super Tuesday states,'' Galanis said.
   ``You can't mold your message as well with satellite interviews,
but you can get two to three minutes on a local newscast,'' he
said. ``Paid advertising ... is the best thing, but the next best
thing is satellite uplinks.''
   Tim Archie, a spokesman for Republican Bob Dole, said large
stations in major markets are less likely to accept a satellite
interview because they are in cities where the candidates are
appearing anyway. These stations also often have a reporter on the
road with the campaigns.
   But for other stations, satellite interviews ``give the stations
a sense of an exclusive,'' he said.

   A number of Democratic congressmen want the
final totals of the 1990 national census adjusted to make up for
the many minority group members and city dwellers they say will be
overlooked.
   Commerce Department and Census officials, who have refused to
agree to such changes, were criticized Thursday at a hearing for
making ``shameful'' and ``political'' decisions.
   Every Census since 1790 has seen at least some criticism for the
so-called ``undercount,'' and the complaints have grown in recent
years despite improvements in census taking.
   Officials estimate that in 1980 only about 1 percent of
Americans were missed in the national head count. But they admit
the problem was much greater among minorities and in cities than it
was for other groups.
   Studies were launched to try and determine if adjustments could
be made to compensate for this problem, but last October the
decision was announced that there would be no adjustment in 1990.
   Pointing out that the people usually missed are most often
minorities and city residents, where the Democratic party
predominates, Rep. Charles Schumer of New York termed the decision
not to adjust ``shameful'' and ``political.''
   He said the action was not based ``on fair-minded concern about
accurate statistics; it's a raw exercise of partisan politics.''
   Schumer's remarks came Thursday at a hearing of the House Post
Office and Civil Service census subcommittee. Reps. Mervyn M.
Dymally of California and Robert Garcia of New York also raised
concerns about the decision not to adjust. All three are Democrats.
   Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner denied that politics were
involved in the decision, contending that statisticians disagree on
whether there is an accurate method of making adjustments.
   ``I don't think it would make the problem any better if we were
to devise an elaborate mathematical system to make up new
numbers,'' Ortner said.
   The focus of the problem is the fact that all 435 seats in the
House of Representatives and billions of dollars in state and
federal money are distributed on the basis of the figures collected
every 10 years by the Census Bureau.

   Kansas Republicans convene Saturday to elect
the last 14 of the state's 34 delegates to the Republican National
Convention, and it's expected to be a good day for Bob Dole.
   All will be pledged to support the Kansas senator on the first
ballot in New Orleans, since Dole claimed all but 16 of the 1,249
county delegates elected five weeks ago in the Kansas GOP caucuses.
   The convention also will ratify the election of five delegates
recommended from congressional district conventions held Feb. 20.
The other 15 national delegates were elected at the district level.
   No contests are expected for the 14 slots still to be filled,
but some challenges are expected for the final 14 alternate
delegates to be elected. Kansas also has 34 alternates.
   Gov. Mike Hayden, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum and other elected
officials, party leaders and prominent Republicans will claim the
14 open delegate positions, sources said. Their election is not
automatic, but nobody is expected to challenge them for the slots
out of respect for their prestige and position.
   The 1,249 delegates elected at county conventions Feb. 1-7 are
all eligible to attend the state convention and vote on the
national delegates, but some are not likely to show up.
   Hayden, who is expected to be elected chairman of the delegation
going to New Orleans in support of Dole, and Kassebaum will address
the convention.
   State GOP Chairman Fred Logan Jr. said Dole also may talk to the
convention by telephone but the senator will not come to Topeka.
   ``The main order of business is to elect the rest of our 34
delegates for Bob Dole,'' Logan said.
   The national convention is Aug. 15-18 in New Orleans.

<HEAD>For First Time In Canada, Member of Parliament Says He Is Gay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in Canadian history, a member
of Parliament has revealed that he is homosexual, surprising the
public, delighting gay rights activists and provoking right-wing
ridicule.
   Svend Robinson, of the socialist New Democratic Party, made his
announcement in Parliament Thursday.
   ``We do not choose to be gay or lesbian and are not seeking
special rights, merely the right to live openly in dignity without
losing our jobs or homes or being subjected to violence,''
Robinson, 36, said.
   His honesty had consequences.
   Robinson's constituency office in Burnaby, British Columbia, was
vandalized last weekend following reports he was about to confirm
longstanding rumors about his sexual orientation.
   Premier Grant Devine of Saskatchewan, father of five children,
expressed fear that Robinson's statement would encourage young
people to try homosexuality. Devine said his compassion for gays
equaled that for bank robbers.
   Pollsters said the declaration may damage the New Democrats'
chances in the next election.
   But Toronto gay rights activist Russell Armstrong called
Robinson's decision a ``quiet act of heroism.''
   ``He set a wonderful example for all of us who have to make that
same kind of revelation in our lives,'' Armstrong said. ``I feel a
kind of jubilation.''
   The Minneapolis-born Robinson explained in an interview with The
Associated Press why he chose this week to make his disclosure
after a nine-year parliamentary career which made him the enfant
terrible of Canadian politics.
   ``It was a difficult decision in both personal and political
terms. I didn't want to be perceived as a single-issue candidate or
a gay member of Parliament, but rather as a member of Parliament
who happens to be gay.
   ``For me as for any other gay or lesbian person, it is a
liberating experience,'' the legislator said.
   Robinson, whose family moved to Canada in 1964, said it was
important to make his declaration before the federal election which
Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney may call this year.
   The New Democrats are at a historical high in the polls under
their popular leader, Ed Broadbent, and could vie for power.
   Other factors in his decision, Robinson said, were the
government's two-year delay in fulfilling a pledge to outlaw
discrimination against gays and lesbians, a growing trend of
violence and harassment against homosexuals, and ``attempts to link
AIDS to homosexuality by the Jimmy Swaggarts of the world.''
   ``Rather than allowing extreme right-wing fundamentalist
homophobia to become stronger, I think it's important that we stand
up and say this is enough,'' he said.
   He denied being pressured into revealing the truth but cited
past harassment, including an incident following the 1985 AIDS
death of film star Rock Hudson. A Conservative member yelled across
the floor of Parliament, ``Why aren't you at Rock Hudson's
funeral?''
   ``It stung,'' said Robinson, who disclosed his secret in a
speech and two major television interviews earlier this week.
   A lawyer and graduate of the London School of Economics,
Robinson is known as an aggressive spokesman for minority and
left-wing causes and has been thrown out of the House of Commons
several times.
   Broadbent chastised Robinson last year for heckling President
Reagan over U.S. support for Nicaraguan rebels when Reagan
addressed the Canadian Parliament.
   Robinson's judgment was criticized again this week for saying
there are homosexuals in the federal Cabinet, a statement he later
withdrew. He also said he wished it were socially acceptable to
stroll ``hand in hand'' with the man he cares about in Vancouver's
Stanley Park.
   Columnist Orland French of the Toronto Globe and Mail noted that
Robinson is justice critic for the New Democrats. French commented
how odd it would be if the New Democrats are elected and Justice
Minister Svend Robinson were seen traipsing hand in hand through
the park with his male lover.
   ``Is Canada ready for this?'' the columnist asked.
   Robinson said he knows of three other legislators who have
revealed their homosexuality: Labor member of Parliament Chris
Smith in Britain, and Congressmen Gerry Studds and Barney Frank
from Massachusetts.
   Robinson acknowledged ``political risks'' but was confident he
would be renominated for his seat this weekend.
   Pollster Angus Reid said the New Democrats would find it harder
to shed their fringe-party image. The Financial Post commented:
``The reality is that there is an undercurrent of fear of
homosexuals in Canada.''
   Robinson didn't shed all his apprehensions. He asked a reporter
if his story would reach U.S. newspapers. ``I've got relatives in
the States and some are aware and some aren't,'' he said.

<HEAD>Antarctic Ozone Loss, Global Warming May Be Worsened By Methane
Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp increase in methane gas in the
atmosphere since 1978 probably will make Earth warmer and may
worsen seasonal losses of protective ozone over Antarctica,
scientists say.
   But the 11 percent increase in methane in the past decade also
may slow depletion of the ozone shield over the rest of the planet,
said F. Sherwood Rowland and Donald R. Blake, chemists at the
University of California at Irvine.
   Their NASA-funded study was published today in the journal
Science.
   Methane is the major component of natural gas, but about 80
percent of atmospheric methane comes from decomposition in rice
paddies, swamps and the intestines of cows, with some contribution
from wood digestion in termites, Rowland said.
   Humans are responsible for increased methane levels because they
are raising more cows, growing more rice and chopping down tropical
forests, which provides food for more termites, said atmospheric
scientist Pat Zimmerman of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colo.
   Researchers generally agree that by trapping solar heat like
glass in a greenhouse, methane, carbon dioxide and pollutants are
likely to warm Earth's lower atmosphere by 3 to 5 degrees by the
year 2050.
   They fear this ``greenhouse effect'' may cause crop-threatening
droughts and partially melt polar ice caps, which could raise sea
levels up to 15 feet and threaten coastal cities.
   Ozone is an air pollutant at low altitudes, but in the
stratosphere it shields Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.
Scientists say reduction of the ozone layer will cause more skin
cancers and might trigger climatic changes.
   In 1974, Rowland and chemist Mario Molina first warned that the
ozone layer was threatened by man-made chlorine compounds called
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are used as refrigeration
coolants, aerosol propellants and for making plastic foams. The
United States banned spray-can CFCs in 1978.
   Mounting evidence indicates CFCs are responsible for the
worldwide loss of about 1 percent of Earth's ozone shield and the
formation of a hole that forms in the ozone layer above Antarctica
for a few months starting every September.
   Blake and Rowland said methane increases may worsen the ozone
hole by aiding formation of ice clouds above Antarctica. That's
because studies by Molina and others suggest the clouds enhance
chemical reactions that allow chlorine from CFCs to break down
ozone.
   As methane rises into the polar stratosphere, it breaks down and
releases hydrogen, which combines with a chemical called hydroxyl
to form water, which in turn freezes into clouds, Blake explained.
   Outside Antarctica, wind and higher temperatures prevent
formation of stratospheric clouds, so methane attacks chlorine from
CFCs, reducing the amount of chlorine available to destroy ozone,
Blake said.
   The 11 percent methane increase ``will make the ozone hole over
Antarctica more severe. It will probably make the ozone depletion
in the rest of the world less severe,'' said Molina, of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
   He said the increase ``will make the greenhouse effect more
severe.''
   Rowland and Blake also said that because increasing atmospheric
methane reduces the amount of hydroxyl present, it indicates the
atmosphere is losing its ability to cleanse itself of pollutants.
Hydroxyl reacts with many pollutants and removes them from the
atmosphere.
   Their study also indicates the rate of increase in methane gas
slowed slightly during the past five years.
   Blake and Rowland collected air samples regularly between
January 1978 and September 1987 at up to 60 locations around the
Pacific to measure methane levels.
   Earlier studies suggested methane levels more than doubled
during the previous 200 years. Based on that, Blake and Rowland
calculated methane increases may have raised the amount of water
vapor in the stratosphere by 28 percent since the 1940s and by 45
percent over the past two centuries.

   American Jewish leaders ending a visit to
Israel say they are still troubled by the ongoing violence in the
occupied lands but are convinced that U.S. Jews should air their
criticisms in private, not public.
   It is a formula supported by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who
told the American Jewish leaders this week: ``It is absolutely
un-Jewish and very dangerous to join an anti-Israeli front with
non-Jews'' by publicly chastizing Israel.
   The 42-member Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations
met in Jerusalem for a week-long annual conference that ended
Thursday.
   Morris B. Abram, the group's chairman, said he had arrived with
``a good deal of anguish, a good deal of anxiety and misgivings.''
   Other American Jewish leaders also have spoken publicly of their
concern over seeing nightly television footage and reading daily
news reports on the Israel army's tough tactics to quell three
months of unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Reports of troops using excessive beatings of Palestinians and
burying alive four Arabs near Nablus heightened that unease.
   But Abram said that, after private meetings with Israel's
political and military leaders, ``I have not the slightest doubt
the policy is to use restraint ... and the time is not right to
publicly criticize Israel's handling of the unrest.
   ``The question is not whether American Jews have the right to
express dissatisfaction. Of course they do,'' Abram said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``The question is, on matters
of Israel's defense and security, is public criticism effective or
prudent?''
   Shamir called on the U.S. Jewish leaders to stifle outspoken
criticism among their ranks.
   ``Every critical statement of a Jewish leader does much more
harm than many violent demonstrations in Gaza,'' Shamir said. ``It
is inconceivable that, God forbid, American Jews would permit
themselves to be used in the campaign against us.''
   Not all U.S. Jewish leaders agree they should be silent partners
with Israel.
   ``We as Jews need to cut through our illusions and
self-delusions about Israel,'' Albert Vorspan, vice president of
the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, told the organization.
   He said American Jews should speak out about their concerns and
warn Israeli leaders that ``the TV pictures that multiply every day
are potentially explosive'' in terms of Israel's image abroad.
   Vorspan also expressed frustration that Israel's divided
government seemed to be throwing away a chance for peace.
   He described U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's Middle East
peace mission as ``a shuttle between Shamir and (his rival, Foreign
Minister Shimon) Peres.''
   The deep divisions in Israel's government concern some U.S.
Jewish leaders as much as Israel's inability to put down the
anti-occupation unrest. Some warn that that issue is potentially
more damaging to Israel's relations with the United States than the
riots themselves.
   Zvi Rafiah, a retired Israeli diplomat who served in Israel's
embassy in Washington, said U.S. leaders are alarmed because Israel
appears ``incapable, even incompetent in resolving one of its most
important problems, the peace process.''
   In a speech to the Jewish leaders, Rafiah warned: ``The
Palestinian problem has become a time bomb in our relationship with
the United States.''

   Actor Burt Reynolds says that for a long time he
felt it was impossible to marry an actress, but he's changed his
mind.
   Reynolds, 52, says he'll probably marry longtime steady Loni
Anderson, 43, within the year, and that they want to have children.
   ``It's so difficult for an actor and actress to get married, to
fight for the mirror,'' he said in an interview in the current
issue of Us magazine. ``Loni has been successful in breaking down
all of those things.''
   Reynolds also said Ms. Anderson has suffered the classic ``dumb
blonde'' misperceptions.
   ``She's a college graduate, an art major and she's taught
school. She's raised a fabulous daughter,'' he said. ``All of that
speaks for itself. That's part of what makes me so proud of her.''
   Added Ms. Anderson, ``You'd think that when I peroxided my hair

   Academy Award-winning actress Bette Davis
says she set aside five years to establish herself as an actress.
Sixty years later and a month away from her 80th birthday, she's
still working.
   Miss Davis, born April 5, 1908, is preparing for her role in a
new Larry Cohen thriller.
   Miss Davis, who wrote the best seller ``This 'n' That,'' has
overcome a mastectomy and a severe and temporarily crippling stroke
to keep working.
   She has just moved from the East Coast to a Hollywood apartment.
   ``I've never been all that fond of Southern California weather
and I miss the East,'' she said in a recent interview. ``But I
decided I'd become too much of a hermit. I needed to get back in
the world.''
   As for her birthday, ``I haven't quite decided what to do on the
day. On my 70th, I put a black wreath on the front door. But to be
working on your 80th birthday, that's quite something.''

festival teaming Soviet with American artists, organizers say.
   Baryshnikov, a star of Leningrad's Kirov Ballet who defected to
this country, will be joined at the March 27 gala by dancers from
Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet and American Ballet Theater ballerinas
Susan Jaffe, Leslie Brown and Christine Dunham.
   More than 285 Soviet performers will come to Boston for the
March 11-April 2 festival, which is to be followed next year by a
similar gathering involving U.S. artists in the Soviet Union.
   In addition to dancing, the festival will include opera,

<HEAD>Board Says Reserve Forces Are Reaching Capacity Limit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high-level board of military and civilian
advisers is departing from its normal policy stance and questioning
the future of a build-up in reserve forces.
   The suggestion that the reserve forces may be overextended comes
as budget problems appear likely to prevent any significant growth
in reserve and National Guard forces in fiscal 1989.
   In recent years, the 22-member Reserve Forces Policy board has
consistently argued that more money be appropriated for the
reserves because of their increasing role in military preparedness
and strategy.
   The Selected Reserve Forces _ the drilling, so-called ``weekend
warriors'' _ now total more than 1.1 million people, compared with
the 2.1 million on active duty.
   Under the so-called ``Total Force'' policy adopted in 1973, many
of those reservists and Guardsmen would go to war before their
active-duty counterparts because of the equipment they use or the
jobs for which they have been trained.
   The policy board, in its just-released fiscal 1987 report,
repeats its plea for greater financial support for the reserve
forces. But it also advances the unexpected suggestion that the
Pentagon should attend to the strength of its active-duty forces
first.
   ``An appropriate balance should exist between the active and
reserve components,'' the board stated.
   According to Col. Phil Fogel, an aide to the panel, the board
issued its warning this year in part because of declining
projections for military spending.
   ``When you have budget constraints, people tend to want to shift
more responsibilities to the reserves to save money,'' Fogel said
Thursday.
   ``The board is saying you've got to have a sufficient
active-duty force, and that you can't shift like that without
providing the necessary resources, money, spaces in schools, etc.''
   The board said it thought ``the most suitable missions for the
National Guard and reserves are those with low peace-time activity
levels and high war-time surge requirements.''
   ``If a mission must be performed on a daily basis or requires
daily training, that mission is best suited to the active
component,'' the panel said.

Jarrar stabbed the air with his finger and declared that a
political settlement with Israel would be ``disastrous.''
   The Moslem religious leader said the Koran, Islam's holy book,
``forbids recognition of Israel.'' He argued against cooperating
with peace initiatives aimed at ending the three-month uprising in
the Israeli-occupied lands.
   Jarrar's remarks, criticial of the PLO's policy of seeking a
settlement, provoked murmurs of disagreement from men sitting
cross-legged along the wall of the mosque in this village 10 miles
northwest of Jerusalem.
   The dispute, reflecting deep political divisions of Palestinians
despite the unity they have shown in confronting Israeli soldiers,
soon grew into a shouting match.
   It cut short the gathering of more than 150 men, an informal
town hall-type meeting where the heated exchanges continued outside
the mosque under a tree despite a drizzle.
   The first to challenge Jarrar, a charismatic speaker aligned
with the fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, was a middle-aged man
in a white headdress, who asked if there wasn't a peaceful
alternative to street violence.
   The 39-year-old preacher left no room for compromise and warned
that anyone who recognized the Jewish state would be considered an
enemy of Islam.
   ``We don't have any common language with Israel. We have nothing
to demand of them. We are in a state or revolt against Israel. The
conflict should continue until victory,'' Jarrar said, his deep,
resonant voice cracking with emotion.
   A bearded man in his 20s accused Jarrar of breaking ranks with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has endorsed an
international conference to discuss peace with Israel.
   ``The PLO represents all the people. There is no Islamic trend.
There are only Moslems who support the PLO,'' shouted the young
man, a supporter of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization.
   ``I represent the Islamic trend,'' said Jarrar, whose full black
beard signified his fundamentalist allegiance.
   A tall, muscular man rose to disagree with Jarrar's criticism of
Syria and the Soviet Union.
   ``We are in need of Syria. There is a PLO delegation visiting
Damascus now to create a good atmosphere for fighting Israel We
should support an alliance with Syria,'' he said.
   The man, whose comments indicated he was a supporter of the
pro-Soviet Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
faction, blamed Jarrar for provoking the dispute.
   ``We have differences, it is true. But we are all supporting the
uprising and we should not discuss them now,'' he said.
   Jarrar attacked the PLO position, saying Arafat only had agreed
to a conference after losing his independent base in Lebanon, being
driven out of Beirut by Israel and out of the northern Lebanese
city of Tripoli by Syria.
   ``It's impossible to have a peaceful alternative while we are in
a weak position,'' Jarrar said. ``I will not say there is a
possibility of a political solution. It would be disastrous under
the current conditions.''
   The infighting was also reflected in graffitti spray-painted on
walls near the mosque.
   One slogan attacking the peace mission of Secretary of State
George Shultz was signed by the Democratic Front and another
anti-occupation slogan by ``Hamas,'' which means fervor in Arabic
and is used by the Moslem Brothers, a movement founded in Egypt in
1929 by a school teacher named Hassan Al Banna.
   Israeli officials, especially those of the right-wing Likud
Bloc, have stressed the Islamic influence in the ongoing riots.
They have argued that the fundamentalists threaten Western nations
as well as Israel.
   The influence of the fundamentalists has grown since the
violence began Dec. 8. Islamic groups are especially strong in the
occupied Gaza Strip, where there are more refugee camps than in the
West Bank and poverty is widespread.
   But PLO supporters appear to be in the vast majority in the West
Bank, which Israel also seized in the 1967 Middle East war, and
even Jarrar said the riots were not an ``uprising of the mosques,''
as he said some Israeli leaders had claimed.
   ``Israel wants to frighten the West by saying the
fundamentalists are playing an active role. Israel wants to justify
its oppression by saying they are fighting fundamentalists,''
Jarrar said.
   He said the riots had damaged Israel's image in the world, hurt
the Israeli economy by robbing it of Arab labor and tourism, and
prevented the military government in the occupied lands from
imposing new and more harsh measures.
   ``They thought we were sleeping or dead,'' Jarrar said. ``If
there is no other benefit of the uprising it is to show that we
reject oppression.''

<TEXT>
   Air Force officials have been told by
lawmakers to scour their budget for money that would avert the
temporary furlough of more than 80,000 civilian workers.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, chairman of the House Armed Services
readiness subcommittee, told Air Force Comptroller General Claudius
Watts on Thursday that the Air Force could wring the necessary
funds out of its budget.
   ``If the initiative does not come from the military..., it'll
come from this one member,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said.
``These humane issues _ the quality of life that we take such a
deep interest in _ are not going to be affected.''
   Under the Air Force plan, 82,500 civilian workers in the Air
Force Logistics Command could be furloughed for up to 10 days this
year.
   ``I wish I could guarantee to you that no one would be
furloughed,'' Watts told the subcommittee. ``But I can't.''
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said the command would only need to
find $167 million out of its total budget of $5 billion to avert
the furloughs.
   ``We're spending $60 million on a club system for our service
people and $13 million to subsidize golf courses,'' said Kasich.
``We can start by cutting out the $13 millon for golf courses. I
think we've got to find the money.''
   The logistics command is responsible for transporting Air Force
supplies as well as repairing and maintaining equipment. It has
about 7,300 workers at its headquarters at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, and another 2,500 at the Newark
(Ohio) Air Force Station.
   In addition to Wright-Patterson and Newark, the logistics
command operates major centers at Ogden, Utah; Sacramento, Calif.,
San Antonio, Texas; Oklahoma City; Warner Robins, Ga.;
Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona; and Battle Creek, Mich.
   Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah, has introduced a bill aimed at averting
the furloughs by increasing from $1.5 billion to $4 billion the
amount of money the Pentagon could transfer from one account to
another.

   The nation's ``weekend warriors'' in the
military reserves tend to be married and older individuals who have
served in the active forces and have years of experience in their
jobs, a first-of-its-kind survey shows.
   Reservists and National Guard members also tend to come from
military families, almost always have at least a high school
diploma, expect to stay in the reserves because of the pay and
pension benefits as well as out of a sense of patriotism, and now
mirror the percentages of women and minorities in the active
forces, the study found.
   The survey, entitled simply ``Description of Officers and
Enlisted Personnel in the U.S. Selected Reserve: 1986,'' was
released late Thursday by the Pentagon.
   The Defense Department described it as ``the first comprehensive
survey'' of reservists it had ever attempted, adding that more than
52,000 enlisted personnel and 12,000 officers across the country
had been queried on their personal backgrounds and satisfaction
with their part-time military work.
   The Selected Reserve Forces include the Army National Guard, the
Air National Guard, the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps
Reserve, Air Force Reserve and Coast Guard Reserve. Those forces
now include more than 1.1 million men and women, who are expected
to train on active duty for two weeks every year and on one weekend
a month.
   Stephen M. Duncan, the assistant defense secretary for reserve
affairs, said Thursday the Pentagon intended to use the survey to
gauge the adequacy of its recruiting and retention policies for the
reserves.
   According to the survey:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _About 62 percent of part-time reserve officers and 47 percent
of the enlisted reservists spent time on active duty _ an average
of more than four years for enlisted members and five years for
officers. About three-quarters of the reservists come from families
with other members who served in the armed forces.
   _Once they join up, reservists tend to stick with their
commitment. Part-time enlisted reservists have an average 7 years
of service with their units, while officers have an average 10.5
years of service under their belts.
   _The median age for an enlisted member is 29.5, while the median
for an officer is 37.9.
   _Fifty-five percent of the enlisted reservists and 76 percent of
the officers are married; three-quarters of the married reservists
say their spouse supports their part-time military service.
   _Only about 15 percent of the reservists' employers are
perceived as having an ``unfavorable'' attitude toward military
service.
   ``Serving their country was a major contributor to the retention
decision for 55 percent of the enlisted personnel and 59 percent of
the officers,'' the study states.
   ``Earning credit towards retirement was a major contributor for
50 percent of the enlisted personnel and 62 percent of the
officers.''

   Republicans said they were treated like
``common criminals.''
   The Senate's Democratic leader said the Republicans were merely
``cry-babies'' and should act like adults.
   For five hours Thursday, senators talked about and briefly
debated the legality of the Senate's vote last week to ``arrest
absent senators.''
   At one point, spectators in the Senate gallery may have thought
they had wandered into a courtroom.
   Facing the presiding officer at the bench was Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine, drawing on his experience as a former federal
judge to defend the Democrats' vote last week to arrest Republicans
who refused to show up for a quorum call.
   On the other side of the ornate chamber stood Sen. Arlen
Specter, citing his background as a former Philadelphia district
attorney and arguing that senators should enjoy the same
protections against illegal arrest as ``common criminals.''
   That vote resulted in the Senate sergeant-at-arms chasing
senators down corridors and finally entering the locked office of
Sen. Robert Packwood with a team of detectives. The senator was
escorted to the Senate, where he was picked up and carried into the
chamber, feet first.
   Packwood, an Oregon Republican, seemed amused.
   But 17 other Republicans were not, and they spent much of the
day Thursday condemning the whole episode. They introduced a
resolution asking the Rules Committee to tighten procedures by
which senators can be arrested and forced to attend the Senate.
   Specter, R-Pa., charged that ``an arrest is an arrest is an
arrest'' and demanded that in the future, warrants be changed to
``include a written statement establishing the reasons for arrest.''
   The resolution also proposed a rule change that would prohibit
the seizure of an absent senator between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m.
``unless the pending business is of a compelling nature.''
   Through it all sat Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
the man who had proposed the rarely-used motion to arrest.
   He said the complaining Republicans were ``cry-babies'' and the
arrest warrant carried no penalties other than requiring senators
to show up for work.
   ``We bored the American people today with almost four hours of
talk about the `tough life' of senators,'' Byrd complained.
   He called the whole debate ``a tale of woe'' and suggested
``there are several million Americans who would be glad to trade
places with us.''
   Byrd singled out the provision that would limit late-night
arrest warrants other than for ``compelling'' reasons. ``Who's to
determine that?'' Byrd asked. ``The Senate determines that and it
determined that the other evening.''
   Packwood was seized in his office at about 1:30 a.m. last
Wednesday when he and most other Republicans fled the chamber to
prevent the Senate from establishing a quorum. A quorum of 51
senators was needed to keep the Senate in session, and the
Republicans were trying to end an all-night debate on a campaign
spending bill.
   Packwood's unique arrival gave the Democrats a quorum and the
Senate remained in session all night.
   Packwood was not a sponsor of the resolution, introduced
Thursday, and referred to the Rules Committee.
   In addition to Specter, sponsors included Sens. Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, John Chafee of Rhode Island, William Armstrong of
Colorado, Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, Thad Cochran of Mississippi,
John Heinz of Pennsylvania, Dan Quayle of Indiana, Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky, Kit Bond of Missouri, Dan Evans of Washington, Robert
Kasten of Wisconsin, Alfonse D'Amato of New York, Gordon Humphrey
of New Hampshire, Jake Garn of Utah, John Warner of Virginia and
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming.

<HEAD>Talks Aimed at New Soviet Grain Deal Start Next Week</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and Soviet negotiators meet next week
to start work on a new, long-term grain agreement to replace the
current pact that guarantees sales of 9 million metric tons a year.
   ``We look forward to our discussions with the Soviets on a new
U.S.-Soviet long-term grain agreement,'' said a joint statement
Thursday from Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng and U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton K. Yeutter.
   The two officials said they expected the talks that start March
11 in Vienna to be only ``the first step in the negotiating
process'' aimed at fashioning an agreement to replace the current
one, which expires Sept. 30.
   Any agreement produced by the talks would be the third such deal
between the United States and the Soviet Union since 1975.
   The two officials said the earlier ones ``have been important in
stabilizing grain trade between our two countries, and we are
optimistic we will be able to achieve another mutually beneficial
agreement.''
   Under the current five-year agreement, the Soviets agreed to
purchase 9 million metric tons of wheat and corn annually. Four
million tons must be wheat and four million corn.
   The Soviets may satisfy the rest of their commitment through
purchases of wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal or any combination
of those commodities, with every ton of soybeans or soybean meal
counting as two tons of grain.
   Earlier this week, the Agriculture Department announced the sale
of 500,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union
by private exporters. It would be worth about $50 million at recent
prices.
   The sale came under the Export Enhancement Program, a subsidy
established under the 1985 farm bill to provide exporters with
surplus government commodities as an incentive to sell U.S. farm
goods.
   The Soviet Union was a grain exporting nation through most of
the 1960s but began large-scale imports in the early 1970s. The
first long-term pact with the United States was signed in 1975 and
another followed in 1983.
   Friction arose in 1986 when American producers were still
recoiling from five years of weak performance in the farm economy
and the Soviets fell 3.8 million tons short of the minimum wheat
purchase under the agreement, complaining that the United States
failed to meet world market prices.
   The Soviets left untouched a last-minute offer by the United
States under which 4 million tons of wheat were made eligible for
bonuses under the Export Enhancement Act. But the Agriculture
Department made a similar offer again in early 1987 and the Soviets
resumed purchases.

   Elizabeth Shatto and Christina Drury braved
rough seas to rescue a young girl from drowning in the Gulf of
Mexico last summer, earning them an award from the Carnegie Hero
Fund Commission.
   Now the two 16-year-olds from Houston are taking a lifesaving
course.
   ``We hadn't had any lifesaving before that,'' Miss Shatto said
Thursday. ``It was just instinct. You see someone who needs help
and you go get them.''
   Sixteen other people in 10 states were awarded Carnegie Medals
Thursday by the Pittsburgh-based commission, established in 1904 by
industrialist Andrew Carnegie to recognize what he called the
``heroes of civilization.''
   Of the 18 heroes, five died in their rescue attempts, according
to the commission. Each of the heroes or their survivors received a
$2,500 grant and a bronze medal.
   Miss Shatto said she and Miss Drury were in a beach house near
Surfside, Texas, on Aug. 18, 1987, when they heard a young boy
scream. He pointed to 11-year-old Lynette Bennett, whose head could
be seen bobbing out in the ocean.
   ``There was no one else around. If we hadn't been there, she
would be dead,'' she said.
   The girls swam out, grasped an arm and towed the exhausted girl
to shore, fighting a strong current and rough surf. Lynette
recovered after being hospitalized overnight. Miss Shatto said she
and her friend were uninjured.
   Others honored Thursday are:
   _Robert Ray Dodd, 35, of Clarksburg, W.Va., who died helping to
save his 15-year-old son from drowning in 4{ feet of oil in a
storage tank near his home on July 5, 1987.
   _John D. Anderson, 46, of Baldwin, Mich., who died in an
unsuccessful attempt to save a 16-year-old boy from drowning in
Lake Michigan on July 17, 1987.
   _Carlton M. Muse Jr., 34, of New Bern, N.C., who died trying to
save an 18-year-old girl from drowning in the Neuse River on June
1, 1987.
   _James Scott Clay, 30, of Des Moines, Iowa, who died after
rescuing a 30-year-old woman from armed assault on Nov. 4, 1986.
   _Theodore Hansen, 38, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., who died trying
to save a 4-year-old boy from drowning in the Pacific Ocean on June
17, 1984, and Daine N. Vannett, 21, of Newbury Park, Calif., who
took the boy from the unconscious Hansen.
   _Michael L. Reda, 34, of Titusville, Fla., who saved a
10-year-old boy from drowning in the Atlantic Ocean and helped to
save a 40-year-old man who also tried to rescue the boy on Aug. 16,
1987.
   _Raymond S. Cairo, 20, of East Providence, R.I., who helped save
an 8-year-old girl from drowning in the Atlantic Ocean on June 18,
1987.
   _Sallie Ruth Pierdolla, 43, of Marion, Texas, who saved another
woman trapped in a burning car on June 20, 1987.

   IBM researchers say they've set a record high
temperature for superconductivity _ a jump of 35 degrees _ by
varying the recipe that produced the old mark reported last month.
   The accomplishment is a significant step toward making
superconductors practical, according to a superconductivity expert.
   The new material lost all resistance to electricity at minus 234
degrees Fahrenheit, said Edward Engler of the International
Business Machine Corp. Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif.
   The material was a mix of thallium, barium, calcium, copper and
oxygen, the same elements used by University of Arkansas
researchers who last month reported zero resistance at minus 269
degrees.
   IBM used the elements in different proportions. Engler declined
to reveal the new recipe Thursday, citing patent considerations.
   Allen Hermann, chairman of the physics department at the
University of Arkansas, said he was astounded and thrilled by IBM's
result.
   ``I knew someone would probably do us better,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``Well, the race is on.''
   Superconductivity is the ability to carry electricity without
resistance. Scientists want to drive the temperature up as far as
possible to reduce or eliminate the need for chilling. That will
help make the materials practical for use in high-speed computers,
bullet trains and other applications.
   One goal is to reach superconducting temperatures as far as
possible above minus 321 degrees. That is how cold a material gets
when chilled by liquid nitrogen, which is relatively cheap.
   The higher the superconducting temperature is above that mark,
for a material chilled by liquid nitrogen, the more electrical
current the material can carry and the greater magnetic field it
can withstand before losing its superconductivity.
   The IBM compound ``is a significant step'' in that effort, said
Brian Schwartz, physics professor at Brooklyn College.
   He noted that in terms of the Kelvin scale, which measures
temperature in Centigrade degrees above absolute zero, liquid
nitrogen chills to 77 degrees while the IBM mark corresponds to 125
degrees.
   ``Now we have almost a situation with the thallium materials
where if we're working at liquid nitrogen temperatures, we're
working at close to half the transition (superconductivity)
temperature, which is a very nice feature,'' Schwartz said.
   Thallium is poisonous, and scientists say its potential for
practical use outside the laboratory is limited. But they hope to
learn enough from thallium compounds to find more suitable
materials that superconduct at still higher temperatures.
   Engler said the new material has shown no sign of losing its
superconducting ability in the roughly two weeks his team has
worked with it. All of the dozen or so samples made so far have
reached zero resistance in the range of minus 244 degrees
Fahrenheit to minus 234 degrees, he said.
   The thallium compound expelled a magnetic field, a hallmark of
superconductivity called the Meissner effect, Engler said.
   IBM's results were reported this week at a superconductivity
meeting in Switzerland, Engler said. His co-workers at the IBM
center were Victor Lee, Adel Nazzal and Stuart Parkin.
   Higher temperatures for superconductivity have been reported in
the press. But many have not been reproducible, and others were
based only on evidence that a sample contained isolated pockets of
superconductivity, rather than a complete zero-resistance pathway.

<HEAD>Former National Security Aide Testifies in Meese Probe</HEAD>

   Associated Press Writer=
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ An independent counsel investigating Attorney
General Edwin Meese III is focusing on a $1 billion Iraqi oil
pipeline project, calling a former National Security Council aide
as a witness before a federal grand jury.
   NSC aide David Wigg, a central figure in discussions of the
proposed pipeline, went before the grand jury for both morning and
afternoon sessions Thursday in the criminal investigation of Meese
being conducted by independent counsel James McKay.
   In the fall of 1985, Wigg was designated by then-national
security adviser Robert McFarlane to expedite the project. The
proposed pipeline was foundering over Iraq's desire for an
insurance package. Iraq feared that Israel, its enemy for four
decades, would destroy the project.
   Wigg was involved in late 1985 in a plan, which was never
approved, to use Pentagon budget money to ensure that Israel would
not attack the proposed pipeline. Meese said last week through his
lawyers that he had known nothing of the idea.
   McKay's probe is focusing on a 1985 memo to Meese written by his
longtime friend E. Robert Wallach which mentioned that a portion of
up to $700 million from the pipeline would be paid directly to the
Israeli Labor Party of then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
   Wallach was representing one of the project's partners, Swiss
oilman Bruce Rappaport, who has close ties to Peres.
   Peres says that Rappaport offered Israel a $65 million to $70
million a year discount on oil purchases but says he didn't take
the idea seriously and didn't inform other government officials.
Peres denies that Rappaport proposed paying part of the money to
the Labor Party.
   The pipeline, to have been constructed by San Francisco-based
Bechtel Group Inc., was never built.
   McKay is investigating whether Meese may have violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act which makes it a crime for U.S.
citizens, companies or their agents to bribe foreign officials for
help in business matters and authorizes the attorney general to
file suit to block such practices. Meese says he doesn't recall
reading the portion of Wallach's memo pertaining to Labor Party
payments.
   Wigg now is a deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis in
the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Truck Safety Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 50-year-old law exempting truck and bus
drivers in cities from meeting federal safety requirements is one
step closer to being removed from the books.
   The Senate passed legislation Thursday that would apply federal
safety regulations within urban areas for the first time, and would
also commence government consideration of whether to put devices in
trucks that would monitor drivers' performances.
   The bill, which would also require the government to study how
to improve truck braking systems, was approved by a unanimous voice
vote.
   It is aimed at truck and bus accidents that kill more than 5,000
Americans every year.
   Federal regulations set minimum standards for the construction
and operation of trucks and buses, and for the physical condition
of their drivers. They are often stricter and more detailed than
state requirements.
   But the rules do not apply in urban areas. The regulations were
written in the 1930s, when urban traffic was slower than it is
today and lawmakers believed city authorities could keep track of
local problems.
   The exemption for vehicles operating in cities would be
eliminated one year after the bill becomes law.
   The measure would also give the Department of Transportation a
year to determine whether drivers' performances must be monitored
by instruments installed in the trucks, and if so, which devices
should be used.
   Federal rules forbid commercial drivers from driving more than
10 consecutive hours or 60 hours per week. Drivers are required to
keep written records of their hours, but these logs are believed to
be frequently falsified.
   Mechanical and electronic devices are available that could
record the driving time and speed of drivers.
   The legislation would also give the Transportation Department
until Sept. 30 to conduct a study on ways to improve truck braking
systems, and until a year after that to require better brakes if
they are found to be necessary. Brake problems are believed to be a
cause of up to one-third of all truck accidents.
   The measure's chief sponsors are Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo., and
Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   A similar bill is awaiting action in the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Magazine Was Negligent In Publishing Killer's Ad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL L. GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $9.4 million damage award to the family of a
woman whose killer was hired through a Soldier of Fortune magazine
classified ad is ``sending out a warning'' to other publishers, the
jury foreman says.
   An attorney for the magazine said it would appeal Thursday's
verdict in favor of Gary Wayne Black, 18, and his grandmother,
Marjorie Eimann, 64, who sought $22.5 million in their lawsuit.
   ``This fight goes three rounds like a lot of First Amendment
cases,'' said Soldier of Fortune attorney Larry Thompson. ``We lost
the first round but put your money on us in the next two rounds.''
   After deliberating for 12 hours over three days, the jury
awarded Black $1.5 million, $400,000 to Mrs. Eimann and $7.5
million in punitive damages to the plaintiffs.
   ``We're sending out a warning or message to other publishers
that ads placed in a certain context can be a very dangerous
message and publishers as such should be responsible,'' said jury
foreman Herman Castex.
   Sandra Black, Black's mother and Mrs. Eimann's daughter, was
shot to death Feb. 21, 1985, at her home in Bryan, about 90 miles
northwest of Houston.
   Mrs. Black's husband, Robert, is on death row for paying John
Wayne Hearn $10,000 to kill her. Hearn is serving three life terms
in Florida for that slaying and two others.
   Robert Black contacted Hearn through a classified ad Hearn
placed in late 1984 in Soldier of Fortune, the self-styled
``Journal for Professional Adventurers.''
   In a pretrial decision, U.S. District Judge David Hittner ruled
that the Boulder, Colo.-based magazine and parent company Omega
Group Ltd. could not enjoy full First Amendment protection because
of the ad's commercial nature.
   ``This will have no effect on the legitimate press,'' said
plaintiffs' attorney Ron Franklin. ``Soldier of Fortune knew in
fact that it was advertising for contract killers and that offers
no First Amendment protection.''
   Publishing and legal experts were not as certain.
   ``When magazine publishers' advertising people hear a big
verdict based on this kind of ad, they may be more concerned than
necessary to accept controversial advertising,'' said Slade
Metcalf, chairman of legal affairs for the New York-based Magazine
Publishers Association.
   ``These kinds of cases really open the door,'' said David
Protess, a professor at Northwestern University's Medill School of
Journalism in Evanston, Ill. ``There's very little case law on
media negligence. There are almost no precedents.''
   Attorneys said it could take 18 months before the case reaches
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
   Mrs. Eimann shook hands and hugged the six jurors after the
verdict. ``I lost a daughter and he lost a mother,'' she said,
looking at her grandson. ``We felt something had to be done to save
other people's lives.''
   Soldier of Fortune publisher Robert K. Brown said the verdict
would not affect the future of his publication, which sells about
150,000 copies monthly.
   ``Please understand this was a terrible tragedy, a terrible
crime,'' he said. ``We have a great deal of empathy for them, but
we didn't do it.''
   ``This means every publisher is going to have to read every ad
and look into the minds of those placing the ad,'' Brown said.
   Hearn's ad in four issues of Soldier of Fortune read: ``Ex
marines. `67-69 Nam vets. Ex-DI, weapons specialist _ jungle
warfare. Pilot. ME. High-risk assignments. U.S. or overseas.''
   Attorneys and witnesses for the family said ``high-risk
assignments'' meant Hearn and others placing similar ads were
willing to commit crimes.
   Soldier of Fortune witnesses defended the publication as a
legitimate military journal and described the ads as providing
employment for Vietnam veterans as bodyguards, security workers or
mercenaries overseas.
   But the family's lawyers linked at least nine other crimes to
ads before September 1984, including a 1982 Houston murder-for-hire
case.

<HEAD>AIDS Commission Backs Additional $2 Billion for Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A White House commission has adopted its
chairman's recommendation to pour an additional $2 billion a year
into the the fight against AIDS.
   The panel unanimously approved retired Navy Adm. James D.
Watkins' 60 pages of suggestions Thursday night during a brief
business meeting that wrapped up four full days of hearings on a
variety of topics _ such as testing and protection against
discrimination _ that are to be addressed in subsequent reports.
   Watkins had outlined his recommendations at a news conference
last week and they were formally considered by the full commission
on Monday.
   The final version contained no substantive changes although
there were some additions to emphasize particular areas of concern.
   For example, a paragraph was added to emphasize ``that available
data do not provide a basis for comfort or complacency to any
segment of our society. ... We express our concern that inaccurate
and misleading statements suggesting that (the virus) cannot be
spread through heterosexual activity could stimulate transmission
among those who would see such reports as bases for ignoring the
danger that does, in fact, exist.''
   In a section on drug abuse, a sentence added to say: ``In
addition to direct transmission, the use of drugs that impair
judgment can contribute to sexual transmission.''
   That had been suggested by Commissioner Theresa L. Crenshaw, a
physician who specializes in sex therapy and has expressed the view
that alcohol, marijuana and other drugs can lower inhibitions and
result in people engaging in risky sexual behavior that they
otherwise would avoid.
   The bulk of the increased spending called for in the report _
about $1.5 billion a year in federal and local funds _ would go
directly to attacking intravenous drug abuse. The rest, all federal
funds, would go for development of drugs to treat the disease and
additional ways of caring for AIDS patients, such as more group
homes for those who do not require constant hospitalization yet are
unable to care for themselves.
   ``The recommendations are geared toward the establishment of a
`treatment on demand' system for IV drug abusers, whereby treatment
would be immediately available for any IV drug abuser,'' the report
said.
   Health authorities are convinced AIDS is spreading most rapidly
among IV drug users _ who often pass the virus by sharing
contaminated needles _ and their sexual partners and offspring.
   It is estimated that there could be as many as 20,000 babies
infected with AIDS by 1991, most of them catching it directly or
indirectly from the estimated 1.3 million IV drug users in the
nation.
   The other two sections of the report focus on patient care and
basic research for drug development to treat the disease.
   The commission recommends expanding resources for the Food and
Drug Administration, expanding community based clinical trials and
``removing placebos in clinical trials whenever possible.''
   The section on patient care says the aim is ``to promote a
continuum of comprehensive, accessible, cost-effective high quality
care for persons infected with HIV.'' HIV is the medical term for
the AIDS virus.

   Three young men standing on the side of a
road were killed and a fourth injured when they were hit by a
passing van that then fled the scene, authorities said.
   Fairfax County Police spokesman Walter Carmichael said the
accident occurred about 10 p.m. Thursday in a suburb of Washington,
D.C., as the victims were attempting to change a tire on the car in
which they had been riding.
   Witnesses told police that a white van struck the youths as it
passed their car, knocking them between 25 and 50 feet, Carmichael
said. The three were pronounced dead on the scene, while the fourth
victim was rushed to Fairfax Hospital, where his condition was not
immediately available.
   Names and ages of the victims were not released, although
Carmichael said all three appeared to be in their late teens or
early 20s.
   An all-points bulletin was issued for the van, but Carmichael
said witnesses provided little more information than its color.

<HEAD>Bush Holds Strong Lead In South Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush holds a strong lead
over rival Bob Dole among likely GOP voters in South Carolina's
primary, according to a poll published today.
   The Washington Post said Bush had the support of 49 percent of
1,000 people who said they would vote in the GOP primary, while
Dole had 26 percent, Pat Robertson garnered 14 percent and New York
Rep. Jack Kemp claimed 7 percent.
   Among those voters most likely to go to the polls _ those who
said they were certain to vote, had voted in 1986 and strongly
supported a specific candidate _ Bush had 55 percent support to
Dole's 22 percent and Robertson's 17 percent. Figures for Kemp were
not provided in that category.
   The Post survey, taken over six nights ending Wednesday, had a
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. The South
Carolina contest takes place just three days before the big round
of Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses concentrated in the South.
   The Post survey found that even among several different
categories of Christians, former television evangelist Robertson
was not the favorite. Among voters who said they watch television
evangelists almost every week, Bush got 44 percent to Robertson's
27 percent.
   The core of Robertson's support, according to the poll, was
among voters who placed high priority on moral and social issues.
   About 83 percent of Robertson's backers said their main reason
for supporting him was his stand on pornography. Robertson's stand
on abortion was cited by 78 percent of his supporters as a big
factor. About half cited concerns about ``declining moral
standards'' or school prayer as the biggest reason for their
support.

<HEAD>FBI Conduct Called McCarthy-like in Domestic Spy Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel chairman investigating FBI
conduct says a bureau official used McCarthy-like tactics when he
disclosed unproven allegations against an anti-Reagan organization.
   In a floor speech Thursday night, Rep. Don Edwards, chairman of
a House Judiciary civil rights subcommittee, likened the disclosure
to misuse of FBI files by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the
early 1950s.
   McCarthy used ``investigatory information from the FBI'' to
label government officials as communists without proving the
allegations, Edwards said.
   Edwards' panel and the Senate Intelligence Committee are
investigating the FBI's March 1983-June 1985 probe of opponents of
President Reagan's Central America policy. The lawmakers want to
know whether the bureau improperly investigated political activity
protected by the First Amendment.
   The intelligence panel held a public hearing Feb. 23, at which
FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver B. Revell sought to justify
the bureau's investigation. The probe focused primarily on the
Committee In Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, but it
broadened to include a number of other groups and individuals.
   Revell released a report that detailed some of the allegations
against CISPES, none of which were proved by the FBI.
   ``During the McCarthy era, it was a common practice of the FBI
to secretly disclose investigative, file information to
congressional committees,'' Edwards, D-Calif., said.
   ``If the FBI responds to criticism by doing publicly, before TV
cameras, what it once did privately, then we have not come very far
at all,'' he said.
   FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer said: ``Mr. Revell testified at
the request of the committee. This was an open hearing and
therefore the information provided at that hearing was not of a
classified nature.''
   Edwards said he was not trying to prove or disprove the
information, but said the allegations amounted to ``guilt by
association'' since no charges were ever filed against CISPES or
its members.
   Some of the information released at the hearing was made public
previously under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed on
behalf of CISPES. Other information disclosed at the hearing had
not been made public before.
   Edwards called Revell's disclosure of ``unsupported
allegations'' at a public hearing ``a major violation of the key
rule for police investigatory files _ that none of the information
can be published except according to established rules and
safeguards.''
   ``Improper release of file information by the government ... is
a violation of the constitutional and statutory right of privacy
and can cause grave injury to innocent people or groups,'' Edwards
said.
   Among the allegations that Edwards said should not have been
released:
   _Claims that some CISPES members were ``involved in the
distribution'' of a Soviet-forged document to the media.
   _A statement that CISPES was ``believed to have been established
with assistance of'' the Communist Party of the USA.
   _Linking CISPES' political support of the Salvadoran guerrilla
group FMLN to terrorist actions by that organization, suggesting,
according to Edwards, that ``CISPES was somehow connected with
these actions.''
   _A possible connection between CISPES and two bombings in
Washington, because one took place ``about the same time'' of a
CISPES rally in the capital; and responsibility for the second was
claimed by a group with positions ``similar'' to those of CISPES.
   The FBI never brought any charges against CISPES or its members.

<HEAD>Britain Says Falklands Exercise Not Intended To Provoke Argentina</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says a weeklong military exercise
in the Falkland Islands set to begin Monday is not intended to
provoke Argentina, noting that fewer than 1,000 troops are to take
part.
   Argentina, which claims the islands it calls Malvinas, lost a
74-day war with Britain for their possession in 1982 and still has
not formally declared an end to hostilities in the South Atlantic.
   A communique Thursday from Argentina's Foreign Affairs and
Defense Ministries said Argentina has adopted plans for ``vigilance
and defensive alert'' during the British exercise and, if
necessary, ``will execute corresponding defense plans.'' It did not
elaborate.
   Britain's Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Ian Stewart,
told the House of Commons Thursday night that fewer than 1,000
troops and only a small number of aircraft would take part in the
exercise, code-named Fire Focus.
   Stewart said the exercise involves an airlift and is part of a
defensive strategy to keep a minimum of troops in the islands about
400 miles east of the southern Argentine coast.
   The British Defense Ministry announced last June that it was
reducing the strength of its Falklands garrison, but refused to
disclose the size of the cut. Published reports at the time said
the move would cut the garrison then consisting of more than 2,500
troops by about 400.
   Britain completed an international airport at Mount Pleasant
near the Falklands capital of Stanley in June 1985. The airport can
take wide-bodied military jets, enabling Britain to fly in
reinforcements at short notice if necessary.
   Stewart said the development of contingency plans for a massive
airlift had enabled Britain to halve the size of the garrison.
   He gave no figures for the present strength of the costly
garrison but added: ``Such a substantial reduction of the military
presence ... serves to confirm that our purpose is entirely
defensive.''
   A Defense Ministry spokesman, who in accordance with British
practice declined to be named, said later: ``We are not intending
to increase the tension down there ... There is nothing significant
about the timing of it (the exercise). It is not meant in any way
to be provocative to Argentina.''
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain recently notified
Argentina through Swiss diplomatic channels that the exercise was
purely one of reinforcement.
   Diplomatic ties between Britain and Argentina, cut during the
1982 war, remain severed.

Dukakis Strong</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush had a commanding lead
over Bob Dole in the South and Jesse Jackson was in front on the
Democratic side in the race for votes before Super Tuesday
primaries and caucuses, according to a poll published today in The
New York Times.
   The CBS-Times poll, based on telephone interviews between Sunday
and Wednesday of 2,251 likely voters in 14 southern and border
states, found Bush in front with 44 percent over Dole's 20 percent,
Pat Robertson's 12 percent and Rep. Jack Kemp's 3 percent.
   In the Democratic contest, Jackson garnered 21 percent support
to 14 percent for Michael Dukakis and 12 percent for Albert Gore
Jr., according to the CBS-Times poll, which had a margin of error
of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Rep. Richard Gephardt had 10
percent, Gary Hart 8 percent and Sen. Paul Simon, 2 percent, the
Times said.
   Another poll, by Cable News Network and USA Today, indicated
Bush leads Dole 48 percent to 27 percent in the South.
   Among Democrats in the South, the CNN-USA Today poll suggested
Dukakis had 19 percent, Jackson 18 percent and Gephardt and Gore,
14 percent each.
   The poll was conducted Feb. 23-28, with a margin of error of 5
percentage points, the newspaper said.
   Still another poll, this one in today's editions of the Los
Angeles Times, said Jackson had the support of 23 percent, followed
by Dukakis and Gore with 16 percent each.
   The poll surveyed 964 people across the Super Tuesday states who
were likely to vote in the Democratic primaries. The margin of
error for Democrats was 4 percentage points in the poll, which was
conducted for five days, ending Monday.
   On the Republican side, with a 5-point error margin from 766
voters surveyed across the Super Tuesday states, Bush held a nearly
3-1 lead over Dole, getting 61 percent of the backing. Dole got 22
percent.
   Meanwhile, an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll found that
nationwide, the race appeared to be narrowing on the Republican
side to a two-man race between Bush and Dole and on the Democratic
side to a two-man contest between Dukakis and Gephardt.
   The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,368 likely voters
between Sunday and Tuesday, found Bush leading Dole 39 percent to
31 percent, with his lead widening to 45 percent to 24 percent over
Dole in the South.
   The NBC-Journal poll found Dukakis with 29 percent being trailed
by Gephardt with 17 percent. Jackson had 10 percent, it said.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

   Federal researchers could find no new or unusual
pathways by which AIDS spread in a study of 2,059 people who
apparently contracted the deadly disease from unknown sources, says
a report published today.
   Another new study concluded that routine screening of surgical
patients for the AIDS virus is unwarranted because it would wrongly
identify as many as 130,000 people as having the virus for every
surgeon it saved from infection.
   ``Even though surgeons are very important people, somehow
changing the lives of 130,000 people to protect one of them doesn't
seem quite right to me,'' said one of the researchers, Dr. Stephen
G. Pauker.
   Both studies were published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta investigated
2,059 cases of AIDS recorded through the end of September in which
there was no evident means for the patient to have acquired the
infection.
   CDC researchers concluded that known but undetected risk factors
were probably responsible.
   The risk factors are male homosexual contact, intravenous drug
use and receiving tainted blood transfusions or blood products, the
researchers said. Other factors are sexual contact with people
infected with the AIDS virus or at high risk, and residency in a
country where AIDS is passed mainly through heterosexual contact.
   It can be concluded the disease is still following patterns of
transmission that have already been identified, said co-author Dr.
Kenneth G. Castro.
   ``We've had six or seven years of epidemic,'' he said in a
telephone interview Thursday. ``We should have had some change by
now'' if other modes of transmission existed.
   Although the AIDS virus has been detected in saliva, tears and
urine, there is no evidence for believing it can be passed through
these fluids, according to an accompanying article by Dr. Alan R.
Lifson, a public health specialist with the San Francisco
Department of Public Health.
   Of the 2,059 cases, 921 were eliminated because no detailed
medical history could be obtained. Another 825 were found to
involve risk factors that had not been identified originally.
   An additional 32 cases were excluded because the patients had
been incorrectly diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   That left just 281 cases for which no risk factors seemed to
exist, the researchers said.
   The patients or relatives in about two-thirds of these cases
were questioned. It turned out that 34 percent of those subjects
had a history of other sexual disease and 38 percent had visited
prostitutes, the researchers said.
   The findings suggest that the group with no known risk factors
``probably represents a mixture of persons who either had
undetected risk factors or were sex partners of persons in
high-risk groups,'' the researchers said.
   The 2,059 cases were among a total of 41,770 reported to the CDC
through September since June 1981, when record-keeping began.
   By Monday, a total of 54,723 cases had been reported. Of those,
30,715 died.
   In the study of pre-surgical screening, doctors at Boston's New
England Medical Center concluded that routine testing for the AIDS
virus was unjustified.
   ``For a surgeon to get an infection, three things must happen,''
Pauker said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   ``The patient must have disease, the surgeon has to stick
himself or herself, and the infection needs to be transmitted,'' he
said. ``The (chance) all three events will occur is quite low.''
   Pauker and his colleagues said a surgeon's likelihood of getting
infected while working on an infected patient is between one in
130,000 and one in 4,500, based on figures for surgical accidents
and their frequency of causing infection.
   The researchers weighed this against prevalence of the AIDS
virus in U.S. populations _ ranging from one in 100 to one in
10,000 _ and the lowest known false-positive test rate for people
who are screened _ one in 20,000.
   The researchers found that for every surgeon saved from
infection, between 22 and 130,000 people would be falsely labeled
as AIDS-infected. The researchers said those people then would be
told they were infected and perhaps would be denied surgery.
   AIDS desroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a
person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers.

<HEAD>Jackson Says Southern Democratic Party Leaders Trying To Thwart
Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson accused the Democratic
Party leadership in the South of a ``sustained effort'' to thwart
his presidential candidacy, but said it's not working.
   He said he has a two-pronged message that will reap strong
support for him on Super Tuesday, with its round of caucuses and
primaries, concentrated in the South.
   Jackson said one part of his message is the need to rid our
society of drugs, a message that brings an enthusiastic response
wherever he goes.
   The other, he said, is that a ``growing body of American working
people feel abandoned by the law'' and are turning to him because
he addresses their concerns.
   Jackson made the comments in an interview Thursday aboard his
campaign plane flying here. He declined to predict how well he will
do in Tuesday's critical primaries. But he expressed cautious
optimism that his ``economic justice'' theme is reaching whites as
well as his traditional base of black support.
   ``One can never be...certain what's going to happen Tuesday
night,'' he said, but added: ``My sense is there's a higher comfort
level,'' among whites about his candidacy.
   Asked about exit polls following February's Iowa caucuses and
New Hampshire primary that showed his white supporters were mostly
upscale and well-educated rather than the working class he is
appealing to, Jackson said:
   ``That is changing. Iowa led the breakthrough. People were
wrestling with an ancient cultural barrier.''
   By the time Maine held its Democratic caucuses last weekend,
Jackson contended, the working class had become a main force behind
his second-place finish.
   Drugs, he tells his audiences, are the No. 1 ``national security
threat'' against the United States today. People respond to that,
he said, because ``every parent knows their child is threatened
every day by drugs ...People see this as a moral issue of our day.''
   As president, Jackson says his priorty would be to beef up the
Customs and Border Patrol interdiction efforts, press
drug-producing nations to develop other crops, and crack down on
corruption in law enforcement agencies and banks that work with the
drug traffickers.
   The Democratic candidate is criss-crossing the South, touching
down at five states per day for rallies at schools, churches, and
auditoriums to shore up his widespread black support and woo new
white voters.
   On Thursday, Jackson held events in Arkansas, Oklahoma,
Mississippi, but had to cancel a trip to New Orleans because of a
tornado watch that grounded his plane. Instead he spoke by
telephone to a church full of people who were waiting for him.
   The campaign is filled with made-for-TV events to augment the
$100,000 TV ad campaign that begins today in several southern
states.
   Casual conversations with voters along the campaign trail reveal
some sentiment that white voters are more willing to support
Jackson than they were in 1984. Several said the race issue is far
less of a concern.
   ``Jackson represents something we've needed a long time,'' said
Thomas DeLong, a 57-year-old white man who came to hear Jackson
Thursday at Mississippi State University.
   ``The majority of people in this country are not wealthy,
they're not yuppies, they're poor. And they can't get up because
the system won't let them,'' he said.
   Jackson said he senses the difference between this campaign and
his unsuccessful White House bid in 1984 because ``black and white
interests are coming together'' and the racial factors have been
overtaken by economic concerns.
   Jackson cited this week's endorsements of his campaign by
prominent white politicians _ Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Hightower, Oklahoma state Sen. Gene Stipe, and Tennessee Democratic
activist John J. Hooker _ as evidence of an expanding base.
   ``Historical movements in this country have always been kind of
race-based. This is becoming a class-based movement for economic
justice,'' he said in the interview.
   He accused Southern Democratic leaders _ many of whom have lined
up behind the other Southern native son, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee _ of a ``sustained effort'' to try and keep Democrats
from his campaign.
   ``All these elected officials are trying to stop me,'' he said.
   But Stipe said that ``regardless of what the power brokers say,
they cannot stop that momentum'' that Jackson is building.
   Hooker said that in 1984, many whites who would not accept
Jackson are taking a new look after he garnered substantial white
totals in the early primary and caucus states.
   Regardless of how the convention turns out this summer, Jackson
said he will work with the party leaders and push for the party
platform to include planks addressing his priorities on raising the
minimum wage and other concerns of working people.
   He will also seek foreign policy planks on renewing trade with
Nicaragua and working with banks to relieve Latin countries' debts
so those nations can afford to buy more U.S. goods, he said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Much Higher Suicide Rates Among AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians must be more aware of self-destructive
impulses in AIDS patients, who are much more likely to commit
suicide than the general population and even victims of other
terminal illnesses, a new study says.
   The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, found that the risk of suicide among men 20 to 59
years old with AIDS was 36 times greater than for other men in that
age group and 66 times greater than for the general population.
   Other studies have shown that cancer victims are up to four
times more likely than the general population to kill themselves.
   While suicide is statistically rare, the study found that the
threat to AIDS victims comes first when they learn they have the
disease, then again when it begins to affect the central nervous
system.
   ``The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has been associated
with secondary depression and other psychiatric syndromes ... all
of which are associated with higher suicide rates,'' the
researchers wrote.
   The lesson is that physicians treating AIDS patients must be
aware of the possibility of suicide, said one of the researchers,
Dr. Peter M. Marzuk of Cornell University Medical College.
   ``Physicians should evaluate suicide risk in these patients
carefully,'' he said. ``Because of the risk for suicide, the
presence of concomitant psychiatric syndromes, especially
depression and delirium, should lead to early psychiatric
intervention.''
   An accompanying editorial emphasized the potential suicide risk
for people who test positive for the AIDS virus, even though some
of them might not have the disease.
   The presence of AIDS antibodies in a person's blood does not
mean he has the disease, but only that the virus that causes AIDS
has entered his system and provoked a natural disease-fighting
response.
   ``The risk of suicide is one more reason that such tests should
never be considered as `routine,''' Dr. Richard M. Glass, an
associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago
Hospital, wrote in the editorial. ``The enormity of this problem is
indicated by estimates that approximately 1.5 million Americans
have HIV antibodies.''
   There were reports last spring of seven suicides in the Miami
area among people who had tested positive.
   Roger Lane, hotline coordinator for Miami's Health Crisis
Network, said in a telephone interview Thursday that others tried
unsuccessfully to take their own lives on the basis of very
preliminary tests.
   The suicide outbreak coincided with the opening of new
AIDS-testing centers, many of which offered no counseling and some
of which merely gave test results over the telephone, he said.
   ``If you were notifying someone they had terminal cancer, you
wouldn't do that over the phone,'' he said.
   Doctors must specifically ask patients about any suicidal
feelings, Glass said.
   The study reported in JAMA focused on suicides in 1985 in New
York City, where AIDS is the leading cause of death of men in their
30s. There were 3,828 people who had AIDS in the city then, of whom
12 were known to have killed themselves.
   ``These are conservative estimates (of the number of
suicides),'' Marzuk said. ``We don't know how many people may have
taken an overdose of heroin, for example. These would never have
been counted as suicides.''
   AIDS destroys the body's defenses against disease, leaving a
person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers.

   Stock prices inched up in trading today on optimism
about Japan's economy, while the U.S. dollar dipped slightly as
traders awaited market-affecting news.
   The dollar closed at 129.22, down 0.08 yen from Thursday's
close. The dollar opened at 129.16 yen, and ranged between 129.16
and 129.30 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average index of
225 selected issues finished the day at 25,615.62 points, up 19.31
points, or 0.07 percent, from Thursday's close of 25,596.31 points.
   ``The market is strong,'' said Yoshio Ogawa of Nikko Securities.
``There aren't any real factors today, but the market is still
looking good for the same reasons as late last month _ Japan's
economic fundamentals look good, and that is affecting trading.''
   ``There were no important trends today, with the market holding
fairly steady,'' said an analyst who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``But trading was very active.''
   Although volume was a heavy 1.3 billion shares in the first
section, share prices closed mixed, with pharmaceuticals up and
banks and other financials lower, according to dealers.
   The U.S. currency topped the 129-yen barrier in active trading
Thursday, but the market failed to gain momentum due to the lack of
new incentives, said a currency dealer with a major commercial bank
in Tokyo.
   ``This was the kind of day that is very hard to comment on,''
said a foreign exchange analyst who requested anonymity. ``Very
little happened.''

<BYLINE>Judge Declares Reagan Abortion Funding Guidelines Unconstitutional
^By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration has suspended new
regulations that would have cut off federal funds to family
planning clinics which offer abortions or abortion counseling,
after a judge ruled the guidelines were unconstitutional.
   ``Abortion referral and abortion counseling are constitutionally
protected speech under the First Amendment,'' said U.S. District
Judge Walter J. Skinner, issuing a permanent injunction Thursday
against enforcement of the regulations.
   ``Denying an otherwise eligible organization a grant because it
provides abortion counseling or referral, even with non-federal
funds, constitutes an impermissable penalty for the exercise of a
constitutionally protected right,'' he said.
   ``The regulations are specifically designed to suppress speech,
and particularly directed at the suppression of one viewpoint,''
Skinner said. ``As a result, they run directly contrary to the
dictates of the First Amendment.''
   He said the regulations also were contrary to the intent of
Congress when it established the Family Planning Program under
Title X of the Public Health Service Act of 1970.
   The regulations, scheduled to take effect Thursday, will not be
enforced while the administration reviews the ruling and decides
whether to appeal, said Lucy Eddinger, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   Skinner ruled the guidelines would cause irreparable harm to
women who receive services from the clinics and violate a woman's
right to privacy and to choose to have an abortion.
   Federal judges in Denver and New York City had issued temporary
injunctions against the new rules, but had not ruled on their
constitutionality and it was not clear whether those rulings had
full nationwide force.
   ``This court has national jurisdiction in federal question
cases,'' Skinner saidin his 28-page ruling.
   The regulations had not been expected to affect the estimated
4,000 family planning clinics operated with federal funds because
the rules apply only to new grants. About 5 million poor women
receive services through the clinics.
   The injunction was requested last month by the state of
Massachusetts, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health
Association and 13 other local and national family planning groups.
   Although the injunction applied only to those clinics
represented by the groups, Skinner said he expected Secretary of
Health and Human Services Otis R. Bowen to scrap the regulations.
   Scott R. Sterling, executive director of the Washington,
D.C.,-based family planning association, said he expected the
administration to appeal ``because of political pressure.
   ``We expect to be successful at the appeals level as well,''
Sterling said.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon called the ruling
``a major victory for a woman's right to consult privately with her
doctor.''
   The new rules would have prohibited federally funded family
planning programs from providing abortion counseling, referring
women to abortion providers and engaging in lobbying or legal
action to increase availability of abortions.
   If the facility also performs abortions, to keep Title X funding
for its other programs the clinic would have to maintain completely
separate facilities for each type of patient.
   ``In its attempt to implement a health care policy which
promotes childbirth, the defendant has devised a system which rests
in large part of keeping Title X clients in ignorance,'' Skinner
said.
   The Title X budget for fiscal 1988 is $137 million, down from
$142 million in fiscal 1987.

   A factory director whose labor-efficiency plans
won him a $2,700 prize has decided to give up the money because of
the lingering stigma against wealth and a deluge of request for
handouts, a newspaper said today.
   The prize, 10,000 yuan, is a huge sum for most Chinese, equal to
10 years' wages for the average urban worker and double that for a
typical peasant.
   Zhang Xingrang, director of the No. 1 Plastic Factory in the
eastern city of Shijiazhuang, decided not to keep the money after
being besieged with petitions for loans, the state-run Workers'
Daily said.
   The paper said he was receiving dozens of letters each day from
strangers wanting to share in his new wealth, with friends and
co-workers adding to the chorus.
   Zhang won the prize for developing what he called a ``full-load
work plan'' for allocating labor more efficiently at his factory.
He became a nationally famous labor hero, winning praise from
Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang.
   The Workers' Daily said colleagues told Zhang, ``Old Zhang, now
that you're rich don't forget we helped you. You can eat meat now,
a little soup or some bones is enough for us.''
   One letter-writer pleaded for 375 yuan to buy a three-wheeled
pedicab so he could take his children _ including 9-year-old
triplets _ to school.
   ``Take pity on these children,'' he pleaded, addressing Zhang as
``the god of wealth.''
   Another writer said he needed 2,000 yuan to get out of
``financial straits,'' adding, ``This amount is nothing to you.''
   The paper said Zhang feared criticism that has been heaped on
other factory directors who have become rich in recent years
because of incentives and profit-sharing programs designed to spur
production.
   He put the money in a bank and is busy trying to devise a
give-away plan that will satisfy most people, the paper said.
   Zhao declared last October that China is in the ``primary stage
of socialism'' and that it is permissible in this stage for some
individuals to become rich while others lag behind.
   Egalitarianism was the rule for most of China's first four
decades under communism. In recent years, the Chinese government
has relaxed many of its economic policies, allowing for free
enterprise. But many of the new rich have been criticized and even
hit with criminal charges for acquiring large amounts of money.

<HEAD>State Dept. Denies Visa to President of Sinn Fein</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has violated ``the spirit
and letter'' of a new law by denying a visa to the head of the
legal political wing of the Irish Republican Army, says a New
York-based group advocating the end of British rule in Northern
Ireland.
   Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's Sinn Fein, was denied a visa
because of his alleged involvement in terrorist activities in
Northern Ireland, Donna Sherman, a State Department spokeswoman,
said Thursday.
   ``He was ineligible under (the section) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act which excludes from admission to the U.S. people
who are personally involved with terrorist activities,'' Sherman
said.
   But Martin Galvin, spokesman for the Irish Northern Aid
Committee in New York, said in a statement, ``Irish-Americans are
outraged by the refusal of the State Department to comply with the
spirit and letter of the new visa provisions.''
   He was referring to an amendment to an appropriations bill,
passed last year, which in effect overturned that portion of
immigration law allowing the U.S. government to deny visas to
aliens who participate in political activities in their native
countries which would be legal for U.S. citizens in the United
States.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
is outlawed on both sides of the border, although Sinn Fein is
legal.

   USAir says it has agreed to buy 50 Boeing 737
jetliners with options for 30 additional aircraft, a deal worth
$2.4 billion if all the options are exercised.
   Delivery of the new jets will begin in April 1989 and continue
through December 1991, the airline said.
   The twin-engine, short-to-medium range aircraft is the most
popular jet ever sold by the Seattle-based Boeing Co. The deal with
USAir brings to 2,001 Boeing 737s on order.
   Edwin Colodny, USAir chairman and president, said the order ``is
indicative of the health and vitality'' of the airline, which has
its headquarters at Washington National Airport.
   ``Our track record makes it possible to order these new aircraft
which will benefit our passengers and the communities we serve,''
Colodny said in a statement.
   USAir Group, the holding company for USAir as well as Piedmont

   Korean officials shudder and editorial
writers sputter when Rep. Richard Gephardt says a mid-sized
American car costs $48,000 in South Korea because of tariffs _ but
they admit the presidential hopeful is three-quarters right.
   An American car that would cost $10,000 in the United States
costs about $36,000 in South Korea after taxes, tariffs and duties,
according to Korean and U.S. officials.
   The charges limit foreign car sales in South Korea to a few
hundred each year. Last year, South Korea exported 442,557 vehicles
to the United States that averaged $7,000 in price.
   Gephardt has used the $48,000 figure on the campaign trail to
underscore his argument that many nations close their markets to
U.S. goods while taking advantage of Washington's free trade policy
to flood American markets.
   The argument has appealed to some Americans and the Missouri
congressman has emerged as a frontrunner in the race for the
presidential nomination of the Democratic Party.
   Gephardt's platform has caused resentment in South Korea at a
time when the country is under American pressure to open its
markets to imports. South Korea's trade surplus with the United
States, its main trading partner, reached $9.5 billion last year.
   ``Gephardt is a name on many lips here. But the government isn't
too worried since there's still a long way to go in the
elections,'' said a U.S. trade official in Seoul who asked not to
be identified.
   Korean newspapers and television have provided regular reports
on Gephardt since he started singling out South Korea. Gephardt has
been attacked by newspapers as an unreasonable politician trying to
blame others for America's failure to keep its economy healthy.
   ``The charges gave the impression that malicious Korean trade
practices are responsible for the sad state of the U.S. economy.
It's really shocking to us,'' said the Kyunghyang Shinmun in a Feb.
13 editorial.
   But the government has not challenged Gephardt because trade
restrictions do exist, officials said.
   ``It is true to a certain extent that there exists some
discrimination against imported cars,'' said one offical, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Korean officials say their country has many economic problems
and is only just emerging as a modern nation. They say the economy
is fragile and needs protection, including some import barriers.
   The gross national product is below $3,000 per person and the
economy is weighed down by $35 billion in foreign debt.
   Radical students have seized on American trade pressure in
recent weeks in a bid to attract public support. Farmers worried
about cheap U.S. agricultural products have dumped cow manure at
government buildings.
   Most Koreans agree that the economy must be protected, but the
small, scattered protests have attracted little support.
   ``The Korean attitude is to wait until it really becomes a
problem,'' a U.S. diplomat said.
   The government has pledged to open its markets wider to American
and other imports as quickly as possible, but U.S. pressure to move
more quickly is rejected as bullying.
   ``They're promising changes, but if it's going to happen is
anyone's guess,'' said one U.S. business representative based in
Seoul, who asked not to be named.
   The United States has been pressing South Korea to drop import
restrictions on a wide range of goods. Recent talks have centered
on allowing beef imports and lowering the price of American
cigarettes.
   The disparity in the car industry is a good example of the
problems and discrimination faced by American companies, U.S.
diplomats said.
   ``Our figures show about 10 foreign cars have been sold in South
Korea so far this year. We don't think any of them were American,''
said one, noting that the only levy imposed by the United States on
imported Korean cars is customs duty of about 4 percent.

   The massive rioting and arrests of
opposition leaders that followed this week's re-election of
President Abdou Diouf have shaken this West African nation's belief
in itself as a democracy.
   Two days of rioting in the capital that followed Sunday's
national balloting took the government by surprise. It denounced
the hail of stones as stemming from the opposition's ``reckless
manipulation of youngsters.''
   Opposition parties had claimed Diouf's Socialist Party rigged
the voting.
   A state of emergency and curfew were imposed, and soldiers and
riot police flooded the capital's streets. Officials were granted
sweeping arrest powers and authority to curb the media.
   More than 80 buses were damaged, dozens of gas stations and
stores looted or gutted by fire, the homes of some officials of the
governing Socialist Party ransacked. Police raided the university
and opposition party headquarters and fought running battles with
stone-throwing protesters.
   Several top opposition leaders were arrested, including the main
opposition presidential candidate Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese
Democratic Party.
   Wade's fiery rhetoric and call for change clearly struck a
responsive chord. Opposition supporters say the Socialists, after
28 years in power, had themselves become the state, losing touch
with the country's 6.7 million people.
   A senior government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the nation's leaders were shocked:
   ``They did not understand the depth of the feeling. They don't
want to face it and since the campaign began they have been
shrinking away from the real issue. They talk about democracy but
they won't relinquish power.''
   No black African government has ever handed over power to an
opposition party after an election defeat.
   There are 17 registered political parties in Senegal, but just
six participated in the elections. A free press regularly lampoons
the government and even pokes fun at Diouf without fear of
reprisal. Senegalese are proud of those freedoms.
   But the opposition parties act more like Rip Van Winkle than
real parties. Every five years, they wake up to watch the political
parade, then nod off again.
   Many Senegalese, including Diouf supporters, said the
52-year-old president was not powerful enough to control his own
party, which they say has too much at stake to allow the freedom
people demand.
   Diouf supporters joined those who expressed frustration with
nepotism in government.
   Serigne Mor Diop, an out-of-work carpenter, said he thought
Diouf was a good leader and an honest man whose party had gone
unchallenged for too long.
   ``We need Diouf's leadership but we don't need the PS and their
corruption,'' he said. ``No party should be allowed such power.''
   A senior Western diplomat, whose government strongly supports
Diouf, said the president's commitment to democracy was not matched
by the government bureaucracy.
   ``Democracy has been an evolutionary process going on here since
1848,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``These elections are one way of viewing how far it's come. In the
long run, there will have to be further evolution.''
   The Senegalese are outraged when they think their rights have
been abused.
   In riot-torn sections of Dakar and in the industrial city of
Thies about 45 miles away, Senegalese young and old angrily
denounced what they saw as police brutality and violation of their
rights this week.
   With tear gas-reddened eyes and tear-stained faces they angrily
demanded, ``is this what Diouf calls a democracy? We have a right
to peaceful assembly, our government has no right to stop us.''
   Jacques Nzouankeu of Dakar's Center for Studies and Research on
Pluralistic Democracy in the Third World sees such violence as a
serious threat to the handful of democratic countries in Africa and
those moving towards democracy.
   ``It is a catastrophic thing, because those who don't want
democracy are numerous'' he said. ``They are looking for a chance
to say, `See, democracy doesn't work, we need a new system.'''
   Omar Bongo, who heads the one-party Central African state of
Gabon, called the Senegalese troubles proof pluralism is not for
Africa.
   ``See what this leads to?'' Bongo said. ``We are for
democratization of our states, but not for the multiplication of
anarchy.''

   Republican presidential hopeful Pat Robertson
said God had spoken to him, calling him to usher in the second
coming of Jesus Christ, a newspaper reported today.
   In a tape of a December 1984 address to a religious seminar in
Dallas, Robertson said Christ's return is imminent and would be
accompanied by Christians ``taking dominion'' over the wealth and
property of non-believers, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   In a reference to Dallas' downtown office buildings, Robertson
said: ``Imagine the time the people of God have inherited that
property, because the Bible says that the wicked lay up and heap up
treasures for the righteous.''
   In the 1984 tape, Robertson said God had told him ``I have
called you to usher in the coming of my Son.'' He also briefly
speaks in tongues, a form of unrecognizable language uttered by
those who practice charismatic Christianity, during his closing
prayer.
   Robertson has said he received the prophecy in 1968 through
Harald Bredesen, a close associate who laid his hand on Robertson's
head and spoke as if God were speaking through him.
   However, when questioned about the prophecy, both Bredesen and
Robertson characterized it as applying to Robertson's ministry, the
Christian Broadcasting Network. Robertson resigned from CBN before
undertaking his presidential campaign.
   Bredesen said, ``We would all be appalled and Pat would be
appalled,'' at the prospects that Robertson's remarks would be
construed to mean that God's words applied to him personally.
   Asked Thursday to comment about the 1968 prophecy, Robertson
said Bredesen ``may have been referring to Middle East
television,'' and predicted Robertson's role in ``spreading the
gospel thoughout the Middle East'' via CBN's transmitter in Lebanon.
   However, in an April 1982 letter to CBN contributors, Robertson
quoted the Bredesen prophecy and said God has assigned a ministry
to CBN ``to prepare the way for the second coming.''
   Robertson has rebuked reporters for referring to him as a former
television evangelist. He insists on being evaluated on the basis
of his record as a businessman, educator and founder of the
multimillion-dollar Christian Broadcasting Network.
   Robertson contends that examinations of his religious beliefs in
the context of his presidential campaign constitute bigotry. And he
maintains that his fervent evangelical beliefs would not interfere
with his execution of presidential power.

   Police arrested two men in the slaying of a
rookie patrolman who was shot in the head as he guarded a drug
witness last week, a spokesman said today.
   The suspects were picked up Thursday afternoon in the borough of
Queens and questioned for about six hours before their arrest
around midnight, said Officer Peter O'Donnell.
   Two women picked up with the men were released, O'Donnell said.
   The suspects' names, the charges and other details will not be
released until a news conference today, O'Donnell said.
   Officer Edward Byrne, 22, was shot three times in the head at
point-blank range early Feb. 26 while sitting alone in a patrol car
outside the Queens house of a man who had complained to police
about neighborhood crack dealers.
   The Daily News and New York Times, quoting unidentified sources,
said one of the four picked up was 24-year-old Todd Scott of
Queens. The newspapers said Scott works for Howard ``Pappy'' Mason,
an associate of reputed drug kingpin Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols.
   Nichols, 29, was sentenced Feb. 25 to 25 years to life in prison
on drug and gun charges, and is awaiting trial on charges he had
his parole officer killed for revenge. Mason is awaiting trial on
charges he helped carry out the killing.
   Police have speculated that Nichols may have ordered Byrne's
killing as retribution for his long sentence.
   Since the slaying, police have rounded up 294 suspected drug
dealers in their investigation.
   ``Shooting at cops, it's just bad for business. I think
experienced criminals know that; perhaps these inexperienced ones
will learn it,'' Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said Thursday.
   ``The community has been very helpful,'' Ward said.
   The reward for information leading to a conviction grew to
$130,000 Thursday with a $25,000 contribution from members of the
New York Stock Exchange.
   WNBC-TV reported Wednesday night that investigators had
identified two men, including the gunman, and two women believed to
have been in the car that quietly coasted up to Byrne's police car
before he was shot.
   WNBC-TV said police believe the women accompanied the men so it
would look like they were out on a date if stopped. Police declined
to comment on the report.

   Vice President George Bush has added former U.S.
Attorney General Elliot Richardson of Massachusetts to his list of
endorsements in the Republican presidential primary.
   Bush supporters announced the endorsement Thursday at a news

King.
   Richardson, who served Massachusetts as attorney general and

   About 200 Democrats in the Tennessee
Legislature and in state government have endorsed the candidacy of
Albert Gore Jr., their junior senator, for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   ``The Gore campaign has probably received more legislative
endorsements ... than any other campaign. And we need a president
that can work with the legislative branch,'' Gov. Ned McWherter,
Gore's Southern campaign manager, said to the applause of the group
gathered in the Capitol rotunda Thursday .
   Gore was in Louisiana, where he received the endorsement of
Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer.
   Also Thursday, it was learned that former Virginia Gov. Charles
S. Robb would back Gore's bid for the Democratic presidential
nomination. In Washington, the office of U.S. Rep. Buddy Darden,
D-Ga., on Wednesday announced the congressman's endorsement of
Gore.

   Fourteen Democratic state legislators have
formally endorsed the presidential campaign of Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   They joined Senate President John Russo, D-Ocean, who signed on
as a Dukakis supporter last fall.
   Thursday's announcement came three days after several leading
state Democrats _ including a Russo colleague, Senate Majority
Leader John Lynch _ detailed plans to elect an uncommitted slate of
delegates in New Jersey's presidential primary June 7.
   Russo again criticized those plans. Organizers of the
uncommitted slate say New Jersey Democrats might be able to enhance
their clout by remaining neutral until late in the race, when they
would throw their support to one candidate and help that person win
the nomination.
   ``We believe it is the responsibility of the leadership of the
Democratic Party in New Jersey to stand up behind a presidential
candidate,'' Russo said.

   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner and Sen.
Brock Adams, citing his free-trade stance, have endorsed
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for president.
   The state's senior senator, Republican Dan Evans, also made an
endorsement, embracing Vice President George Bush. Evans, a former
three-term governor and titular head of the party in Washington,
chose Bush who is locked in a tight race with Sen. Bob Dole and Pat
Robertson in next Tuesday's precinct caucuses across the state.
   ``I'm supporting Mike Dukakis, not just because he's a friend,
and he is, but because I think he's extremely good for the state of
Washington,'' the governor said. ``He believes more strongly than
any of the candidates running on the Democratic side in the issue
of free and fair trade.
   Dukakis organizers were delighted with the two endorsements.
``To have top Democrats in Washington state picking Mike Dukakis is
a big boost for us,'' said Steven Akey, a spokesman for the Dukakis

<HEAD>Lott Reports Spending $250,275 Despite Having No Republican

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has no
Republican opponent in his bid for a U.S. Senate seat, reports he
has spent $250,275 in campaigning this year.
   Lott's opponent in November will be decided in next Tuesday's
Democratic primary between Rep. Wayne Dowdy, D-Miss., Secretary of
State Dick Molpus and Biloxi pipe fitter Gilbert Fountain.
   Despite the absence of a challenge for the GOP nomination to
succeed the retiring Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., the Lott
campaign since January has employed an expensive series of TV
commercials telling Mississippians about his accomplishments during
his 16 years in Congress.
   Campaign finance reports on Wednesday show Lott, from Jan. 1 to
Feb. 17, had raised $118,839 and spent $250,275.
   The reports also show Lott had $599,250 in cash on hand at the
end of 1987. With the new funds coming in this year, it boosts his
campaign receipts to $718,090.

   Share prices rose in early trading on the London

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index was little changed
when the market officially opened at 9 a.m. up 0.1 points at

<HEAD>California Condor Egg Breeds Hope For Species</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first egg produced by a pair of captive
California condors is a huge success for biologists trying to save
the endangered species, even if it proves to be infertile, a
curator says.
   The egg, laid Thursday at San Diego Wild Animal Park, will be
inspected for fertility Monday, officials said.
   ``If it's not fertile, we would still remain happy,'' said Bill
Toone curator of birds for the San Diego Zoo, which is affiliated
with the park. ``We (now) know they will breed in captivity.''
   Only 27 of the giant birds exist, all in captivity at the park
or the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The 10-ounce, pale blue-green egg was moved from a nest to an
electronic incubator, said park spokesman Tom Hanscom. If fertile,
the egg is expected to hatch within two months.
   The egg may be infertile because the female is old and her mate
may be sexually immature, park officials said.
   By taking the egg from its parents at an early point, scientists
hope to induce the pair to produce a second egg to replace the one
they lost.
   The incubator will maintain a constant temperature and humidity
for the egg. Handlers will turn it 180 degrees twice a day,
imitating the behavior of a mother condor's care in the wild.
   California condors, which have a wingspan of about 9 feet, are
dark reddish-brown, with a curved beak. They were decimated in the
wild by lead poisoning from eating lead shot in animal carcasses,
biologists said.
   The last one living in the wild was captured and brought to the
Wild Animal Park last April in the effort to save the species.
   Since 1981, scientists have successfully hatched 13 condors in
captivity from eggs taken in the wild.
   Wildlife biologists hope to breed sufficient numbers of the
condor in captivity and release the captive-bred birds into a safe
environment in the wild.

<HEAD>Garrison Keillor Sues NPR Over Cassette Sales Of Taped Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Garrison Keillor, former star of ``A Prairie
Home Companion,'' has sued National Public Radio and a New York
distribution company for allegedly violating his copyright by
selling a recorded speech.
   In the lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court here,
Keillor claims he never gave the nonprofit radio network permission
to commercially use a speech he gave last year at the National
Press Club in Washington.
   ``An author is entitled to decide which of his works he wants
sold to the public,'' said Keillor's attorney, Samuel Heins. He
said Keillor wants to stop sales of the 45-minute cassette, which
is called ``Garrison Keillor, Back Home'' and sells for $10.95.
   NPR spokeswoman Cate Cowan said the network handled Keillor's
speech no differently than it does other press club talks by
prominent people, and that NPR's lawyers do not believe the network
infringed on Keillor's copyright.
   NPR included the speech in its catalog of cassettes for sale,
and according to the suit, sold rights to the speech to a record
distributing company.
   That company, Spoken Arts Inc. of New York City, took out an
advertisement last month in Publishers Weekly to promote Keillor's
tape and three others to bookstores. Spoken Arts entitled the
cassette ``Garrison Keillor: Beyond Lake Wobegon'' and listed its
price as $9.95.
   Keillor's suit names both NPR and Spoken Arts as defendants.
Spoken Arts employees who answered the company's telephone Thursday
said President Joel Klein was unavailable for comment.
   The speech was given last October while Keillor was promoting
his book, ``Leaving Home.'' National Public Radio regularly
broadcasts press club luncheon speeches. According to Cowan, it
announces at the end of each speech that cassette recordings are
available for purchase.
   In the speech, Keillor spoke about his feelings on having left
Minnesota just as his beloved Minnesota Twins were about to win the
World Series.
   He also invited recordings of the speech. ``If you have tape
recorders, you are welcome to turn them on at this point,'' he
said. ``You are welcome to use any of this if you want.''
   Heins says in the suit that Keillor filed for a copyright on the
speech Feb. 26. He also said that he asked NPR and Spoken Arts to
stop sales of the tape but that neither has agreed to.
   The suit asks for a court order to impound and destroy all
unsold tapes. It also requests a list of people who have bought the
tapes, and asks for unspecified damages for Keillor and attorney's
fees for Heins.
   Keillor's nationally broadcast live variety show was produced by
Minnesota Public Radio and distributed by American Public Radio
before it was discontinued last June.

<HEAD>Smoker So Addicted She Consumed A Pack While in Labor, Witness
Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 1st graf with 2 grafs to fix garble.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rose Cipollone was so hooked on cigarettes
that she smoked a pack while in labor with her first child, even
though she had tried to quit, an addiction expert testified in
support of her family's liability suit.
   Dr. Jerome Jaffe cited several instances on the stand Thursday
to show that Mrs. Cipollone was so dependent on cigarettes that
smoking governed her behavior until her death of lung cancer at age
40.
   He depicted a smoker who picked butts from the garbage, ordered
groceries just to have cigarettes delivered and puffed away even
after part of her lung had been removed.
   Mrs. Cipollone became a vivid presence for the first time during
the five-week federal court trial. After her death in 1984, her
widower, Antonio of Lakehurst, carried on the suit against three
tobacco companies.
   The defendants _ Philip Morris Co., Lorillard Inc. and Liggett
Group Inc. _ deny they are responsible for her death. One of their
arguments is that Mrs. Cipollone smoked of her own free will.
   Jaffe, a clinical psychiatrist and director of the National
Institute of Drug Abuse's research center in Baltimore, described
what he learned about Mrs. Cipollone's smoking habits during a
75-minute interview at her lawyer's office months before she died.
   ``She was dependent, and I thought heavily dependent, on tobacco
and cigarettes,'' Jaffe said.
   Under cross-examination by Liggett lawyer James V. Kearney,
Jaffe acknowledged that he did not examine Mrs. Cipollone
physically and never saw her smoke.
   Until now, testimony in the case has centered on allegations
that the companies failed to do enough research on the health
effects of smoking, tell the public what they did know or put a
safer product on the market.
   As the focus shifted to Mrs. Cipollone, Jaffe related that when
she was in labor with her first child in 1947, she was asked by
doctors what she wanted. Her answer was a glass of water and _
despite having nearly quit during her pregnancy _ a cigarette. The
doctors brought her a pack.
   ``She said, `I smoked a whole pack before the baby was born,'''
according to Jaffe, who referred to his notes of the interview
while being questioned by Marc Z. Edell, an attorney for her estate.
   In 1964, when the surgeon general's report linking smoking and
disease came out, Mrs. Cipollone consciously tried to ignore it.
   ``It's typical,'' Jaffe said. ``It's the heart of most
dependences. ... Denial is the cardinal symbol.''
   In 1981, when a spot was found on her lung, Mrs. Cipollone threw
away her cigarettes. But Jaffe recalled her saying ``I was smoking
when I went into the hospital'' for a lung operation.
   She continued to smoke after the operation, he said, stopping
the following year when her right lung was removed.
   Jaffe also served as a special consultant to the president for
narcotics and dangerous drugs from 1971 to 1973.

   The Cuban government forced some lepers to join the
1980 exodus for the United States from the Port of Mariel, Cuban
exile leaders claim.
   The charges came during a campaign by Cuban exile groups seeking
to have their homeland's Communist government declared in violation
of human rights.
   The exile leaders say expelling the lepers against their will
violates their rights, and they hope to bring up the matter before
the Commission on Human Rights meeting now in Geneva.
   ``Castro did not show any respect for the human rights of lepers
or for the American people,'' said Jorge Mas Canosa, head of the
Cuban American National Foundation.
   About 30 of the patients being treated in Miami for leprosy, or
Hansen's Disease, arrived during the 1980 boatlift, which brought
about 125,000 refugees to the United States.
   A leper now living in Louisiana said he was forced onto a
Florida-bound vessel on May 3, 1980.
   ``They said `You go or we will put you in prison,''' Jose
Antonio Perez Ortiz, 41, said in an interview taped last week. ``I
could not work. I said `Send me there.'''
   Angel Pino, spokesman for the Cuban Intrests Section in
Washington, denied the charge, saying all who left Cuba did so
voluntarily.

   Paramedic Michael Flaherty jumped into his

was in trouble.
   ``If you walk in and see your mother on the floor, you react,''
Flaherty said. ``I gave her mount-to-mouth ventilation. Everything
worked.''
   His parents were having breakfast Wednesday when his mother,
Theresa, 65, collapsed about 8:45 a.m.
   ``When I heard the address, I could have run there faster than
the ambulance, if that had been necessary,'' Flaherty said.
``Nobody was going to beat us to that address.''
   Flaherty's father, Peter, who is not trained in cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, applied chest compressions before the younger
Flaherty and his partner, Jake Willens, arrived.
   Mrs. Flaherty was rushed to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston
where she was in fair condition, apparently suffering from
inadequate blood supply to her heart.
   Chief Fire Department Paramedic Ronald Smith praised Flaherty's
actions. ``He saved his mother's life. He brought her back,'' Smith
said.
   ``I didn't know if it was a heart attack or respiratory
arrest,'' Flaherty said. ``No paramedic or firefighter wants to
resuscitate or work on his own parents or children or friends.
   ``But when something happens and you have to do it, you react,''
he said.

   Indian troops prevented Tamil students
from holding demonstrations they called for today, warning people
that they would be shot if they gathered, reports from the region
said.
   Sri Lankan military officials said four Tamil rebels were killed
Thursday in a shootout with Indian troops in a village near the
northern town of Jaffna.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the rebels were killed after they attacked an Indian patrol.
They said one Indian soldier was badly wounded.
   India has about 45,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka to enforce an
Indian-sponsored peace accord signed last July to end the Tamil
rebels' four-year separatist insurrection.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest of the rebel
groups, has rejected the accord. The Tigers have been the focus of
Indian search operations in and around Batticaloa, a town 140 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   Protest marches were called for in Batticaloa by the Eelam
Revolutionary Organization of Students, which has endorsed the
peace accord but alleges Sri Lankan soldiers are violating it
through shootings and arrests. Under the accord, the Sri Lankan
army is to be confined to barracks.
   In telephone interviews, Batticaloa residents said that Indian
troops drove through the town warning civilians they would be shot
if they violated orders prohibiting public gatherings.
   The residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no
incidents were reported.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million population. They claim they are discriminated against by
the island's majority Sinhalese Buddhists, who control the
government and military.
   The peace accord signed July 29 calls on the Tamils to lay down
their arms in exchange for more political autonomy in the northern
and eastern regions where they live.
   India has become involved because it has about 60 million ethnic
Tamils in its southern states who are sympathetic to their Sri
Lankan brethern.

<TEXT>
   England's Duchess of York watched
apprehensively as her husband, Prince Andrew, rocketed off the bow
of the world's largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier for a
thrilling jet ride.
   ``It was incredible. A sensational end to a great visit to the
Nimitz,'' Andrew said Thursday following his catapult in an S-3A
Viking anti-submarine warfare jet.
   The flight and an air show were highlights of a day at sea for
the Duke of York and his pregnant wife, Sarah, both pilots, who
also inspected one of the vessel's catapults and massive chains
that hold the ship's two 60,000-pound anchors.
   The couple, on a 10-day tour of Southern California to promote
British culture and trade, began the day visiting Park Century
School for learning-disabled children accompanied by British
actress Joan Collins.
   Today's schedule for the royal couple includes visits to the
offices of Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
and the University of California, Los Angeles.
   As the prince proceeded to the jet plane for the afternoon
flight, he said, ``This is one of the loneliest walks I've ever
done.''
   The engines screamed, and Sarah, wearing a flight helmet of her
own, clutched a gift teddy bear as she watched the jet soar off the
ship. It turned back for a low fly-by and the pair waved to each
other before the duchess boarded a helicopter for her own flight to
Long Beach, where the royal yacht Britannia is docked.
   The duke and duchess returned to the Britannia to host a
Thursday evening dinner.
   Earlier, the duchess was presented a boatswain's mate's whistle,
used to pipe dignitaries aboard, and she playfully tooted on it as
she and the duke rode up to the flight deck on a huge aircraft
elevator.
   Sarah also chatted with sailors on the mess deck, asking Airman
Michael McAmis, 25, of Akron, Ohio, if his sleeping quarters were
roomy enough.
   ``It's all relative,'' McAmis replied, drawing a smile from the
duchess.
   Sarah then headed to the ship's port side, which drew laughter
from McAmis, who said, ``We only cleaned the starboard side today.''
   The Nimitz, powered by two nuclear reactors that drive four
propellers, had sailed from San Diego heading north to its home
port at Bremerton, Wash., with 3,000 men, half its full flight
compliment, and only a few aircraft aboard.
   The couple were presented leather flight jackets bearing the
inscriptions ``Duke of York'' and ``Duchess of York,'' then sat
down to watch an air show from the main deck.
   Jet after jet touched down on the deck at 160 mph, catching one
of four cable arresters on the carrier's stern and stretching them
150 yards before coming to a halt.

<HEAD>Church's Policy-Making Body To Decide Swaggart's Punishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The policy-making body of the Assemblies
of God will resolve an unprecedented rift between national and
state church leaders over the punishment of fallen TV evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart, a spokeswoman says.
   ``This will be a final decision with no right of appeals,'' said
Juleen Turnage, Assemblies secretary of information. ``Our
executives feel that this is a situation that needs to be ...
expedited quickly.''
   G. Raymond Carlson, the general superintendent of the
Pentecostal denomination based here, said in a statement Thursday
that the General Presybtery would meet March 28 to make a decision.
   Meanwhile, in New Orleans, three state appeals court judges
heard arguments on whether they should revive a $90 million lawsuit
filed against Swaggart by a preacher he accused of adultery.
   A lawyer for preacher Marvin Gorman said evidence gathered by
private detectives who investigated Swaggart will be made public in
court if the lawsuit is reinstated. If the judges refuse to revive
the suit, attorney Thomas Frasier said, the evidence will be made
public in some other manner.
   The judges gave no indication when they would rule.
   Swaggart, a Baton Rouge, La., evangelist with a $150 million
empire and a worldwide television following, confessed to
undisclosed sins after reports linked him to prostitutes.
   Swaggart has admitted sinning against his wife, but has not gone
into detail. What others are saying he has done, depending on the
specifics, might best be described as voyeurism, sexual perversion
or pornographic acts.
   An investigation to determine if Swaggart can keep his
ministerial credentials has grown into a circle of meetings with
the Louisiana District Council and the Executive Presbytery
debating his punishment.
   The Louisiana officials recommended Swaggart be suspended from
the pulpit for three months, but national leaders have said such a
short suspension for a minister who has confessed to moral
misconduct would be unprecedented.
   National officials asked the state leaders to reconsider their
recommendation, but in another unprecedented move, the state
refused.
   Mrs. Turnage said the executives had hoped to have the March 28
meeting earlier, but previous commitments by some of the 250
General Presybters prevented it. The General Presbytery meets
annually, usually in August.
   The General Presbytery consists of the 13 executive presbyters,
representatives of the Assemblies' districts, foreign missions and
colleges and honorary members. It is described as the policy-making
body for the church and serves as the court of appeals on
ministerial credentials.
   Only once within the last 25 years has it convened in special
session to deal with a church matter. The matter then was the
founding of Evangel College in Springfield, Mrs. Turnage said.
   ``The majority vote prevails,'' she said. ``The only item on the
agenda is Jimmy Swaggart. They will have open discussion and a vote
will be taken.''
   She said the presbyters can request that Swaggart attend the
meeting, ``but at this time, that point has not been discussed.''
   Mrs. Turnage said figures will not be available for another
three weeks to determine whether the Swaggart situation has had any
effect on contributions to the nation's largest Pentecostal
denomination.
   Last year following the PTL scandal, contributions rose 6
percent, and the Assemblies gained more church members and
churches, she said.

   New York City's new schools chancellor says he
will begin shaping up one of the nation's most troubled school
systems by abolishing time clocks and paring down the bloated
central bureaucracy.
   Richard R. Green's inaugural message, delivered amid
unprecedented pomp and splendor Thursday in the ornate chapel of
Erasmus Hall High School, was that New York City's schools are ``on
trial. Business as usual must come to an end, and it must do so
today.''
   Green left behind a 30-year career in Minneapolis schools to
lead the 939,000-pupil system, the largest in the nation with a
$4.8 billion annual budget.
   Green was ushered into the oak-paneled chapel by six children
wearing sashes reading ``The Class of 2000.'' Greeting him on the
speaker's podium were Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Edward I. Koch,
Board of Education president Robert F. Wagner, Jr., and other
dignitaries, all wearing academic robes.
   Frequently departing from a prepared text of a 20-minute
inaugural address, Green took a generally conciliatory tone toward
the many problems and constituencies he faces. But he vowed that
the infamous central bureaucracy would likely face cuts, especially
with Mayor Koch pressuring the board to find $28 million in budget
savings.
   ``I have heard that 110 Livingston Street has been immobilized
by the twin abuses called apathy and cynicism,'' he said. ``This is
a new day.''
   ``By July 1, I will have a management team in place that I can
rely on. And there will be some transfers out of 110 Livingston,''
he said, referring to the Brooklyn headquarters of the city Board
of Education.
   He also vowed to remove the time clocks that teachers are
required to punch. And he said that ``We are going to find a way to
open schools to parents who want to use facilities and I am certain
we can reach a new accommodation with our custodians.''
   Green did not mention his controversial suggestion of an
11-month school year which he made off-the-cuff on Wednesday while
touring several schools.
   United Federation of Teachers president Sandra Feldman called
the 20-minute speech ``an exciting beginning. He was both tough and
caring. I was especially gratified that he singled out the work
done by the city's teachers and the fact that they don't get enough
recognition as professionals.''
   The city's first black chancellor has his work cut out for him.
The system, which has 32 autonomous districts, has a dropout rate
pegged by the School Board at 30.7 percent. An independent panel
put the figure at 50.4 percent.
   Many of the city's 1,050 school buildings are deteriorating, and
an estimated 25 percent have serious problems.
   Green's staff of 61,000 teachers exceeds the number of students
in the Minneapolis system, yet officials expect the city will need
40,000 new teachers by 1994.

   The newest House rejection of aid for the
Nicaraguan Contras has put the rebels on the defensive as they near
face-to-face peace talks with the Sandinista government, a Contra
spokeswoman says.
   The House rejected a $30 million humanitarian aid package
Thursday night, only hours after Contra leaders agreed to meet the
Sandinistas inside Nicaragua without a mediator.
   ``Every time the United States turns its back on the Contras, it
puts us in a less favorable position,'' said Contra spokeswoman
Marta Sacasa. The Sandinistas ``will become even more intransigent
and more hard line.''
   The failed bill had limited the use of the funds to food,
clothing and medical supplies and a plan to help young war victims.
The 216-210 vote against the package meant the rebels, whose last
U.S. aid ran out Tuesday, would be left without new supplies unless
Congress passes another measure.
   ``We of course wanted a positive vote, but the death or survival
of the Nicaraguan Resistance is not tied to the U.S. Congress,''
Ms. Sacasa said. ``We have adapted and we will continue to adapt.''
   She said this setback, coupled with a Feb. 3 House rejection of
a $36.2 million aid package proposed by President Reagan, makes it
clear the Contras cannot count on the United States.
   ``We are fighting against an enemy that doesn't have these kinds
of problems. The aid from the Soviet Union has not stopped flowing
to the Sandinistas,'' she said.
   While a date for the peace conference has not been set, the
Contras on Thursday accepted in principle an offer of face-to-face
talks made by Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   But the Contras insisted in a communique that Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo of Managua, who was dismissed by Ortega as a
mediator after two previous negotiating sessions, be present as a
``witness and guarantor.''
   Ortega has proposed that the talks take place in southern
Nicaragua with his brother, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,
heading the government delegation.
   The Contras appointed Adolfo Calero, considered to be one of the
more hardline directors, to head their delegation.
   ``We are accepting a face-to-face meeting in Nicaraguan
territory,'' director Alfredo Cesar said after a daylong meeting of
the directorate.
   Ortega had suggested that the meeting be held in the town of
Sapoa near Nicaragua's Costa Rican border on March 10-12, but Cesar
said the time and place should be worked out later.
   The communique signed by the five directors of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, as the Contra rebels are formally called, lambasted
Ortega for dismissing Obando y Bravo as a mediator.
   It called the action ``unilateral and dictatorial,'' and praised
the cardinal for his help in pushing the peace talks.

   When Kate Reed ambled into her
bathroom early one morning and flipped on the light, she found she
didn't need a cold shower to wake up _ there sat a 6{-foot long boa
constrictor on her toilet seat.
   She went back to her husband, Rob, and calmly said, ``Honey,
please wake up. There's a snake in the bathroom.
   ``He sat bolt upright in bed and said, `What?'''
   Meanwhile, their dog, Tootsie, slept calmly on the bathmat.
   The snake escaped Jan. 28 from upstairs neighbor Brian Wycoskie,
who, after a call from Rob Reed, came downstairs to retrieve his
wayward pet, named Cleopatra.
   Wycoskie said he hadn't told the Reeds about the escape because
he thought someone had stolen it.
   Cleopatra apparently slithered down Wycoskie's toilet on
Thursday and picked the wrong pipe to return home.
   ``I found out they're a water animal,'' said Wycoskie, who also
owns Connie the Florida cottonmouth rattlesnake, Hercules the
tarantula, Sting the scorpion, Vince the black widow spider and
tropical gecko lizards named Abbott and Costello.

   A 12-year-old girl who earned $500 by going
without television for a year says she doubts she'll revert to
heavy TV watching, even though she's now free to do so.
   ``I think I'm going to continue on doing my homework first,''
Jenny Machalleck said Thursday after watching her first television
program since March 2, 1987.
   ``I'm really happy with how my grades have come out,'' she said.
``They weren't bad before, but now they're at the head of the
class.''
   Earlier in the day, she received the $500 check her parents had
promised if she could go a full year without TV. They made the deal
to cure her of her six-hour-a-day addiction to the tube.
   But Jenny said she was too busy doing homework Thursday night to
celebrate by watching the show she had wanted to, ``Cosby.''
   She said she finished in time to watch the last half of
``Cheers.''
   Her first TV viewing in year was fun, she said, ``because I
hadn't watched in so long. But I found I hadn't really been missing
anything. I was just not as enthusiastic as I thought I would be.''

   Communist gunmen killed a soldier and
a policeman in a suburb of the capital today in the second deadly
attack by urban guerrillas in two days, police said.
   Elsewhere, the military said about 200 communist New People's
Army rebels raided a northern mountain village, set fire to a
police detachment and kidnapped a policeman.
   President Corazon Aquino vowed today to crack down on crime and
pursue an ``unrelenting campaign'' against communists.
   She told a conference of 1,700 newly elected mayors and
governors that their main task will be to restore order.
   ``The first and most important is law and order throughout the
land,'' the president said. ``This calls for curbing criminality
and the destruction of rightist and leftist elements in our society
that are bent on the overthrow of our government and our
democracy.''
   She also called for breaking up illegal gambling syndicates and
``flushing out and shutting down the vice dens.''
   In suburban Pasig today, four gunmen opened fire on Tech. Sgt.
Norberto Fungo as he was walking near the public market, police
said. As they were escaping, the rebels opened fire on Patrolman
Severino Francisco as he tried to draw his pistol, police added.
   The gunmen commandeered a passenger jeep and escaped.
   The killings occurred one day after two men and two women gunned
down Margarita Tenorio, 62, a ward leader and president of the
anti-communist vigilante Crusaders for Peace and Democracy.
   Police said the assailants scattered leaflets claiming
responsibility in the name of the ``Jun Somono Squad'' of the Alex
Boncayao Brigade, a rebel urban guerrilla group that killed scores
of police and soldiers in the capital last year.
   Somono, an urban guerrilla, was slain last year by police.
   The attack on the police detachment occurred Thursday in
Sadanga, about 180 miles north of Manila.
   A constabulary report said police manning the outpost put up a
brief fight but surrendered after two defenders were wounded. The
report said the rebels confiscated police firearms, burned down the
outpost and took a patrolman hostage before fleeing to the forest.
   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in a February 1986
military-civilian revolt that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos
after 20 years in power.
   The military chief of staff said today he did not believe the
time was right to allow Marcos to return from exile in Hawaii.
   ``If you would ask me personally, it is not advisable for him to
be back at this time,'' Gen. Renato de Villa told reporters.
   The general's remarks follow reports that two of Mrs. Aquino's
relatives met with Marcos in Hawaii to discuss terms for his
possible return.
   De Villa said former military officers implicated in coup
attempts remain at large in the country and Marcos' return might
jeopardize security. But he expressed doubts that the Marcos groups
could muster enough support to topple the government.

<HEAD>Black Student Activist Receives Threatening Letter; Fraternity
Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE L. BURNEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A University of Pennsylvania fraternity that
sponsored a strip show in which white students jeered black dancers
has been ordered to close for 1{ years, and a black student
activist received a death threat he believes stemmed from a protest
of the incident.
   Blacks and feminists at Penn have complained bitterly during the
past few weeks about the rush party at the all-white fraternity.
During the party last September, two black women stripped,
performed sexually explicit acts and danced naked before an
audience that shouted racial epithets, according to the university.
   The school on Thursday ordered the 112-member Zeta Beta Tau to
close for at least 1{ years because of the incident, the fraternity
said.
   ZBT President Zane Brown, in a statement, apologized for the
incident but said the decision by the Penn judicial board was
``unjust.''
   The death threat was made earlier this week against Conrad
Tillard, director of the Organization of Black Consciousness, in a
letter sent to a reporter at Penn's student newspaper, the Daily
Pennsylvanian.
   The writer claimed to be a student member of the Jewish Defense
League, but school officials did not believe the claim, and the JDL
denied any connection with the threat. The fraternity that was
ordered closed is primarily Jewish.
   ``The main thing it said was that I was a target on their hit
list,'' Tillard said. ``It also said that in general they're trying
to stop the rise of this black power group that I'm helping bring
about.''
   Tillard will receive around-the-clock protection by campus
police that will continue ``as long as is necessary,'' said
security spokeswoman Sylvia Canada. Philadelphia police said they
were investigating the letter; the FBI also acknowledged receiving
a copy but declined to comment.
   Tillard said he believed the letter stemmed from a rally Monday
sponsored by his group, which called on the school to oust ZBT.
However, the letter did not mention the fraternity incident,
Tillard said.
   Black officials said the fraternity incident and the death
threat reflect growing racial tension not only at the Ivy League
campus but at colleges around the country.
   ``What is happening now, in terms of the real tensions on
campus, is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Jacqueline Wade,
director of Penn's Afro-American Students Department. ``I think
we're going to see across the nation something that's very
reminiscent of the '60s.''
   ``Racism never left the university environment,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., about 300
people rallied Thursday to protest bigotry. The day before, police
guarded the offices of a conservative weekly campus newspaper that
revived stinging attacks on a black professor and reawakened
charges of racism at the school.
   Rabbi Howard Alperg, director of Penn's Jewish Campus Activities
Board, said ``black radicals'' are trying to turn the fraternity
controversy into a black-Jewish issue.
   But Daniel Gamulka, chairman of the Jewish Student Council, said
the fraternity incident enraged both white and black students.
   ``The Jewish community does not support what happened at ZBT,''
said Gamulka. ``They find it offensive, just as anyone would.''
   Relationships between black and Jewish Penn students have been
strained since a verbal confrontation between the groups in 1986,
when the Black Student Unity Conference planned to feature a
keynote address by Louis Farrakhan, Nation of Islam leader.
Farrakhan's critics say he is anti-Semitic.

   A driver who secured his teddy bear with a

   The 31-year-old victim, whose name was being withheld until his

   ``For unknown reasons, he drifted to the right and struck a
guardrail,'' Perez said. ``He went airborne about 35 feet and down
into a chain-link fence.''
   Paramedics pronounced the man dead at the scene, said CHP
dispatcher Ruth Frias.
   The teddy bear remained in the vehicle, Perez said.
   ``The investigating officer was telling me that (the driver) was
alone in the car, but he had a little teddy bear with him,'' Perez
said. ``He had the teddy bear seated in the passenger seat with a
belt on.''

<HEAD>Report: Despite Increases In Seizures, Drug Flow Grows in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increases in federal seizures of
imported cocaine and marijuana raise the demand for greater amounts
of drug imports and likely fatten the coffers of Latin American
drug producers, a study concludes.
   The study, released Thursday by the Rand Corp., found that more
and more narcotics shipments are being stopped at the borders, but
an even greater number are getting through to meet demands of
American drug users who are ``relatively insensitive'' to higher
prices that may result.
   ``While interdiction raises smugglers' risks, they adapt in the
short run and learn in the long run. Very large increases in
expenditure might lead to more seizures and arrests, but not to
large decreases in consumption,'' said the study by the research
institute.
   Between 1981 and 1986, the government tripled its spending in
the war against imported drugs, from $237 milion to $801 million,
the study said. The military portion of that rose from $1 million
to $196 million.
   Despite the increase, the amount of cocaine reaching U.S. users
rose from between 38 and 68 metric tons in 1981 to between 111 and
153 tons in 1985, the latest year for which figures were available.
   The amount of marijuana entering the United States during the
same period rose from between 8,700 and 12,700 metric tons to
between 9,447 and 12,228 metric tons.
   Seizures of cocaine rose from less than 2 metric tons to more
than 25 metric tons, while seizures of marijuana were halved from
4,000 metric tons to 2,000 metric tons.
   The figures were based on official estimates of the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Adminstration, the study said.
   In addition, Latin American drug manufacturers may be getting
even richer because they make money whether the drugs are
successfully smuggled or not, said the study.
   Meanwhile, it added, a stepped-up seizure of cocaine from
Colombia has caused a shift to Mexican and domestic sources.
   The study, which looked only at cocaine and marijuana, comes as
Congress considers a proposal that would make the Defense
Department a primary agency in the interception of drugs at
substantially increased costs to taxpayers.
   The Defense Department now serves a secondary role, mostly by
providing radar surveillance and limited air and sea pursuit, to
the three agencies that have primary responsibility in stopping the
drug flow: the Coast Guard, the Customs Service and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service.
   Meanwhile, on Thursday the U.S. Coast Guard said it has ended
its routine drug-smuggling patrols by land and sea off the West
Coast because of budget constraints.
   The decision to stop routine sea patrols and surveillance
flights will result in more smugglers successfully delivering their
cargo, Rear Adm. A. Bruce Beran said.
   Beran, commander of the Coast Guard district that includes
California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona, said he ended the patrols
six weeks ago in an effort to trim some $1 million from his
district's budget.
   He cited as an additional budgetary pressure some $100 million
in cuts to Coast Guard funding contained in a proposal for the 1989
federal budget.

<TEXT>
   A tugboat leased by a company in
this small fishing village in northern Baja California was
repossessed, reportedly at gunpoint, by its U.S.-based owners early
today, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   Coast Guard officials in San Diego received a distress call in
broken English early today on an emergency radio channel reporting
that armed men were hijacking the vessel, said Jeff D'Annolso of
the San Diego office.
   ``The report said six armed Americans went aboard the tugboat
Northern Warrior,'' said Petty Officer Reid Crispino of the Coast
Guard station in Long Beach.
   The report was called in by the Chartering Panama Co., which
runs a fleet of tugboats that escort tankers in and out of Rosarito
Beach, about 30 miles south of the U.S.-Mexico border, Crispino
said.
   The tugboat was leased to the Mexican company by Seattle,
Wash.-based Stabbert & Associates, he said.
   ``We contacted the owners in Washington and they confirmed they
were repossessing the tugboat due to a lack of payments by the
lessee,'' Crispino said.
   Investigators had not determined how many men boarded the boat,
which was in port at the time, or confirmed whether they were armed.
   Crispino said the Coast Guard had no control over the matter
because it took place in Mexican waters.
   ``If (Chartering Panama Co.) wants to pursue the matter, they'll
have to go to a civil admiralty attorney. It's now a legal
matter,'' he said.

   Dr. Louis G. Keith, 53, an obstetrician-gynecologist at
Northwestern University Medical School at Chicago, testified
falsely about transfer of bacteria by the tail string of the
intrauterine shield, the Justice Department said Thursday in
announcing the indictment.
   Keith faces eight counts of perjury and one count of obstruction
of justice. If convicted on all counts, he faces 45 years in prison
and $85,000 in fines. An FBI spokesman said Keith was expected to
surrender in Chicago today and be arraigned March 17 in Tampa.
   ``Dr. Keith is innocent and will be vindicated,'' said his
lawyer, Matthew Kennelly. ``That is all I will say.''
   On March 15, 1983, Keith told jurors in a Tampa lawsuit against
A.H. Robins Co., the manufactuer of the IUD, he had performed
experiments that verified the safety of the birth control device.
In fact, he did not design, direct, conduct or do the scientific
experiments ``about which he testified,'' the indictment announced
in Washington said.
   The alleged perjury came during the suit brought by Linda Harre
of Tampa, who alleged that the shield caused her to become sterile.
She lost the $12.5 million suit.
   Mrs. Harre won a new trial in March 1985 when the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta issued a scathing opinion
attacking the veracity of Keith's testimony.
   Five months later, A.H. Robins filed for protection from its
creditors in federal bankruptcy court in Richmond, Va., a measure
which barred future action on pending lawsuits, including Mrs.
Harre's.
   John D. Taylor, a spokesman for A.H. Robins in Richmond, Va.,
said Thursday evening that Keith had testified for the company in
several lawsuits, and the firm has no reason to believe he ever
lied.
   The company halted production and sale of the Dalkon Shield in
the United States and abroad in 1974, although distribution
continued in some foreign countries until early 1985, said Taylor.
   Some 200,000 claims have been filed against A.H. Robins by women
who contend they suffered pelvic infections, sterility or
spontaneous abortions because of the Dalkon Shield. A.H. Robins
sold 2.8 million of the devices between 1971 and 1974 and has paid
more than $300 million in legal damages involving its shield.
   Robins spokesman Roscoe Puckett said the firm is awaiting court
approval of a reorganization plan that would set aside $2.375
billion to settle claims relating to the Dalkon Shield.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's
Jatiya Party increased its majority in Parliament today after
national elections marked by violence, fraud and an opposition
boycott.
   At least 11 people were reported killed and more than 300 were
injured during voting Thursday for 299 contested seats in the
330-seat Parliament. Turnout appeared very low and even Jatiya
Party members acknowledged ballot boxes were stuffed.
   With results in for 194 races, Jatiya candidates had won 176
seats. In 18 of those contests, they ran unopposed. One race was
postponed because one of the candidates for the open seat was
killed.
   A coalition of 73 minor opposition parties won nine seats,
according to Election Commission figures. Two other small parties
had one seat each, and independents gained seven.
   Another 30 seats in Parliament are reserved for women, who are
chosen later.
   Opposition leaders alleged that the outcome was due to rigged
voting, which is common in Bangladesh politics.
   The opposition, which launched a campaign Nov. 10 to demand
Ershad's ouster, succeeded in shutting down most of Dhaka on
election day with a general strike. But the government said the
election, the fourth in Bangladesh's 17 years of independence from
Pakistan, was ``successful and peaceful.''
   Foreign reporters who visited polling stations in and around
Dhaka noted a low turnout and much vote tampering.
   Ershad, a former army general who seized power in a 1982
bloodless coup, called the elections in a failed attempt to appease
the opposition.
   At separate news conferences today, chief opposition leaders
Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia vowed to continue the campaign to oust
Ershad, who was elected president in 1986 in balloting they say was
rigged.
   In those elections, the Jatiya Party won 152 seats in
Parliament. The main opposition Awami League won 102, and small
parties held the rest.
   The two opposition leaders said rallies in Dhaka were planned
for Saturday to protest the balloting.
   Ershad scheduled Thursday's elections after he dissolved
Parliament last December, 3{ years ahead of schedule. The move was
aimed at working out a compromise with his foes, but they demanded
instead that Ershad step down and said elections held under him
wouldn't be fair.
   Election officials and some Jatiya Party said ballot boxes were
stuffed to favor the governing party and inflate the turnout.
   The independent Bangladesh Observer newspaper reported on
polling in nine cities and did not list any with heavy voting. The
descriptions it used for turnout in various cities were ``very
negligible ... very meager ... 1 percent to 2 percent'' of the 47.8
million eligible voters.
   Home Minister Abdul Matin claimed there was a good turnout.
   He told reporters that on the basis of 12 voting centers he
visited in Dhaka, he estimated voter turnout at 50 percent.

<HEAD>Detective: Accused Remained Calm During Police Questioning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEDHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager accused of fatally bludgeoning
a classmate with a baseball bat for a thrill smiled while denying
any knowledge of the boy's fate two days after the slaying, a
detective testified.
   ``He was very calm, almost bored, sort of like, `Don't bother
me.' He grinned, when I asked if he knew where Shaun was,''
Detective John Devine said during the second day of Rod Matthews'
trial in Norfolk Superior Court.
   Devine said Thursday he questioned Matthews twice about
14-year-old Shaun Ouillette's whereabouts.
   Prosecutors say Matthews, a 15-year-old being tried as an adult
in the 1986 slaying, showed the body in the snowy woods to friends,
who stayed mum for weeks.
   Defense attorney John Philip White has not denied that Matthews
killed his classmate. But White said Matthews was a mentally ill
child from a troubled home and whose use of the prescribed drug
Ritalin, used to counter hyperactivity in children, contributed to
his actions.
   Devine testified he went to Matthews' home after a bus driver
said he had seen Matthews and Ouillette together the previous
afternoon.
   When asked where Ouillette was, Matthews, then 14, said he had
not seen him the previous day and suggested he might be in a
neighboring town, the detective said.
   During later questioning, Matthews said he played pool at home
with Ouillette on Nov. 20, two days before Matthews' initial
questioning, but still denied knowing anything about his
whereabouts, Devine testified.
   Forensic pathologist George Katsas, who performed an autopsy,
testified the victim had three head injuries, the largest six
inches long, which fractured the skull.
   Chemist Robert Pino of the state police crime lab said blood and
hair on the bat matched Ouillette's.
   Other former friends told a shocked courtroom Wednesday of
viewing Ouillette's body only hours after a pre-Thanksgiving pep
rally, then bicycling with Matthews to a shopping mall pizza parlor
for a snack.
   ``He said it could happen to us. He said, `You never know,'''
testified Robbie Peterson.
   The former friends said Matthews named several potential victims
before settling on Ouillette, an overweight high school freshman
who had moved to the community south of Boston a year earlier.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Calls for Reagan-Ortega Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua called for direct talks
between President Reagan and President Daniel Ortega and said
Congress' rejection of aid to the Contras would help peace in
Central America.
   The lefist Sandinista government Thursday also urged the Reagan
administration not to interfere in cease-fire talks between it and
the Contras, the U.S.-backed group that has been fighting to
overthrow it.
   A statement released by government spokesman Manuel Espinoza
said the U.S. House of Representatives' rejection of aid for the
Nicaraguan rebels ``must contribute to the peace efforts taken by
the presidents of the Central American countries.''
   The House voted 216-210 to kill the $30 million package of
``humanitarian'' aid.
   The Contras, meanwhile, accepted Ortega's proposal to resume
negotiations in Nicaragua March 9-11, but said Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo must be kept on as mediator.
   Ortega said the talks should go on without the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Managua, who mediated two previous rounds.
   The president proposed that the new talks be held in the town of
Sapoa near the Costa Rican border. The government also reiterated
its call for direct talks between Ortega and Reagan.
   ``The government of Nicaragua urges one more time that the
president of the United States undertake direct negotiations with
the president of Nicaragua that take into account security aspects
(and) the normalization of relations'' between the two countries,
the statement said.
   The United States has insisted on talks between the Contras and
Sandinistas and has refused to talk to the Nicaraguan government.
   The Nicaraguan talks are being held in line with a peace plan
signed by five Central American presidents on Aug. 7.

<HEAD>Transit Authority Rejects Low Bid From Consortium Including
Japanese Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority has rejected a $49.2 million low bid from a construction
consortium that included a Japanese firm, citing a congressional
ban on awarding federally funded contracts to Japanese companies.
   The provision, signed by President Reagan in December, bars the
awarding of contracts to firms of any country that discriminates
against foreign bidders in its own public works projects.
   It was aimed at Japan, which has prohibited foreign
participation in more than $60 billion worth of public works
projects it plans during the next 10 years.
   The Metro board made its decision Thursday as U.S. and Japanese
negotiators were meeting at the State Department in an attempt to
resolve the construction dispute, a major source of contention
between the two countries.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, who co-authored the provision
with Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, hailed Metro's decision.
   ``The Japanese private sector needed to know that America is
ready to use the leverage at our disposal to open their market. If
they didn't think we meant business before, they know it now,''
Murkowskiaid.
   ``No one is going to take a chance of using a Japanese firm in
any capacity for any project,'' said Metro deputy general counsel
Robert Polk. The law ``will have the desired congressional
effect,'' he said.
   The low bid came from a joint venture between Kiewit
Construction of Omaha, Neb., and the Kajima Construction Company of
Japan to work on tunnels and rails for a new subway line, which is
to run beneath an existing station in northeast Washington. Kajima
was a 30 percent partner in the plan, and Kiewit 70 percent.
   John F. McElhenny, Metro's assistant general manager for design,
said bidding on the project will be reopened. He said rejection of
the contract is not likely to delay construction, which is
scheduled for completion in 1993.

<TEXT>
   A 77-year-old man accused in the mercy
killing of his ailing wife received reassurances from family
members as he attended her funeral in the company of the county
sheriff.
   ``You know I really loved her, don't you?'' a weeping Oscar
Carlson asked his daughter, Marcene Cole, as he reached to hug her
after the service Thursday at Faith Lutheran Church.
   ``Of course,'' Mrs. Cole said through her tears as they embraced.
   Carlson, described as a kind man and a regular churchgoer, was
escorted to the funeral by Douglas County Sheriff Terry Eilers and
three deputies. The frail former farmer did not wear handcuffs or
leg chains.
   Asked if Carlson's family had forgiven him, nephew Gordon
Johnson said, ``Right after it happened.''
   ``Look at what Oscar was going through,'' Johnson said. ``You
live with someone for 40-some years ... they were always together
... and then it all falls apart. I think there's a lot of sympathy
for Oscar.''
   Carlson was charged with first- and second-degree murder after
authorities said he used a .22-caliber weapon to shoot his
71-year-old wife, Agnes, four times Monday at a nursing home.
   Carlson said he killed his wife of 47 years to spare her from
the agony of Alzheimer's disease, a debilitating ailment that
leaves its victims disoriented and often unable to care for
themselves. Agnes Carlson exhibited the first signs of the disease
four years ago.
   Just before the service Thursday, Carlson was allowed a moment
alone at the open casket. He held his wife's hand for a time and
then relatives came up to embrace him.
   Pastor George Larson did not mention the circumstances of Mrs.
Carlson's death. Instead, he urged the family to take comfort in
the biblical promise of life after death.
   ``Agnes believed in the Lord,'' Larson told the approximately
120 mourners. ``When we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ we have
already begun our eternal life and death is just a passing.''
   Carlson was returned to jail in Alexandria after the service to
await a Monday hearing, at which his attorney plans to request that
Carlson's $100,000 bail be reduced and he be allowed to use his
house as collateral.

   A British official of the Oxfam relief
organization was kidnapped with a Syrian colleague in the southern
port city of Sidon, Oxfam headquarters said today.
   Peter Coleridge, 44, and Omar Traboulsi, 31, were seized
Thursday night, Oxfam spokesman John Magrath said in Oxford,
England. Coleridge is the organization's Middle East coordinator
and Traboulsi is its Lebanon representative, he said.
   ``We've had conflicting reports as to whether they are still
being held or not,'' Magrath said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the abductions, which brought
the number of foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon
to 24.
   There were no eyewitnesses confirming the abduction, said
Nissrine Rawda, an official at Oxfam's Beirut office.
   Oxfam is a British charity that aids refugees and poor people
around the world.
   Ms. Rawda said Coleridge went to Sidon Thursday accompanied by
at least two local Oxfam staff members and had been expected back
in Beirut later today. Sidon is 25 miles south of Beirut.
   She said Coleridge arrived in Lebanon two days ago on his first
visit in three years to inspect Oxfam's operations. He lives in
Oxford with his wife and two daughters.
   Magrath said he could not give any other details of the
abduction. A police spokesman said Lebanese authorities had no
information about a missing Briton.
   ``We have ideas about who might have done it, but we don't want
to speculate,'' Magrath said.
   ``The people we work with on the ground have told us not to
panic. We know they're making contacts in Sidon to find out exactly
what's happened and see that Peter and Omar are released.''
   The Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon radio station earlier
reported in Beirut that Coleridge and Trabousli were missing
shortly after their arrival in Sidon.
   A British embassy official termed the report at that time ``a
false alarm.''
   Sidon is Lebanon's third largest city with a predominantly Sunni
Moslem population of about 250,000.
   On Wednesday, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants released a
West German captive, Ralph Schray, 30, in Beirut five weeks after
he was kidnapped.
   Two U.N. Relief and Works agency officials, Jan Stening, 44, of
Sweden and William Jorgensen, 58, of Norway, were kidnapped near
Sidon Feb. 5, apparently by Palestinians acting independently of
guerrilla groups.
   Their abductors handed the two over to the Palestine Liberation
Organization on Tuesday after 25 days in captivity.
   Twenty-two other foreigners are missing and believed kidnapped
in Lebanon. They include nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three
Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two
unidentified men.
   The hostage held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized
March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Unemployment Falls to Lowest Level Since 1979</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with February unemployment
figures. Picks up in 3rd graf, ``Productivity among.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment slipped 0.1 percent to 5.7 percent last month as
half a million new jobs were created, the government said today.
   The February decline brought unemployment to its lowest level
since the summer of 1979 and followed no change in jobless levels
in January, the Labor Department said.
   Employment grew by 280,000, with the number of jobless Americans
falling by 108,000 to 6.9 million, the department said in its
survey of households.
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a net increase of
531,000 jobs in February, 40 percent of which were in service
industries.
   On Thursday, the department said the nation's productivity rose
just 0.9 percent last year, only slightly more than earlier
estimates and the lowest since the last recession, the government
says.
   Meanwhile, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks slipped
7.80 points to 2,063.49, the dollar was mixed in foreign exchange
and bond prices barely budged in lethargic trading.
   Productivity among non-farm businesses that are responsible for
three-fourths of the nation's economic activity rose at an annual
rate of 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department
said. That contrasted with a 0.2 percent deterioration reported in
preliminary figures last month.
   Productivity is a measure of the amount of labor required to
produce goods and services.
   The revisions raised the productivity improvement for the entire
year from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent, slightly more than half the
1.6 percent gain of 1986.
   The efficiency improvements for the year were the smallest since
1982, when an economic recession depressed output so much that
productivity actually declined 0.6 percent from 1981.
   ``Anything less than 1 percent is a disappointing number,'' said
Roger Brinner, an economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass. ``It gives you very little room to buffer pay increases and
not much leeway to improve the standard of living.''
   The revised figures on productivity showed output of goods and
services by non-farm businesses rising by an annual rate of 5.6
percent in the fourth quarter.
   That was the greatest increase in nearly two years and compared
with a rise of 5.1 percent in the preliminary figures before the
gross national product was revised upward last week by the Commerce
Department.
   But in achieving that higher output, businesses increased the
total hours worked by their employees by 5.3 percent.
   ``Frankly, we don't foresee much improvement in productivity
this year,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill
Lynch. ``Productivity improvements require rapid growth and we
haven't been experiencing much of that lately.''

<TEXT>
   A twin-engine commuter plane flying from Nancy to
Paris crashed near the capital this morning while waiting to land,
killing all 22 people aboard, aviation authorities said.
   The Fairchild 227 turboprop, owned by the small aviation company
TAT, apparently hit high-tension wires and crashed in a field in
Pamfou, a town near Melun, 25 miles southwest of Paris, police said.
   The force of the crash gouged a huge hole in the plowed land,
police said. Officials said there was snow in the region and
temperatures were below freezing.
   The aircraft was carrying 19 passengers, including a baby, and
three crew members, TAT Commercial Director Patrice Decourt told
The Associated Press. Earlier reports said 21 people were aboard.
   Debris from the plane was spread out over hundreds of square
yards and workers were combing the field and surrounding forests.
   The director of the Nancy-Essey airport, Jean-Claude Philippe,
said the plane had been circling the Melun area in the
Seine-et-Marne region, 25 miles southeast of Paris, waiting for
orders to land at Orly airport.
   ``Planes are landed sooner or later. So they are stacked up,
waiting for a free runway,'' Philippe said. ``They don't wait long,
of course. Several minutes.''
   Decourt said the plane was in the holding pattern for six to
seven minutes after the 50-minute flight from Nancy, then ``plunged
very rapidly'' to the ground.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known. Police and
rescue workers were searching the area for the aircraft's black box.
   ``The plane ... was perhaps in a situation of intense icing, but
TAT's experience with this type of plane leads us to believe that
circumstances which we are not yet aware of led to the accident,''
said a statement issued by TAT.
   The U.S.-made Fairchild 227 is built under license from the
Dutch company Fokker.
   The last ground contact with the plane was at 7:32 a.m.,
according to the control tower at Orly. The aircraft disappeared
from the radar five minutes later.
   A trainee flight attendant, Helene Guillou, said in Nancy that
she missed the flight because she overslept.
   ``I was an intern hostess and this morning I didn't hear the
alarm clock,'' Ms. Gillou said in a telephone interview with The
Associated Press.
   She said the same plane made a trip without problems Thursday
night but that the pilot had mentioned icy conditions.
   Today's crash was the worst plane accident in France since 1981,
when a Yugoslav DC-9 went down near Ajaccio, Corsica, in the
Mediterranean, killing 180 people.

   Peace talks on Afghanistan recessed today so
Pakistan could decide if it is willing to sign a settlement with
the Soviet-backed Afghan government. The mediator said all
substantial differences had been worked out.
   The head of the Pakistani delegation, acting Foreign Minister
Zain Noorani, flew back to Islamabad for weekend consultations with
the country's political leaders, including opposition
representatives.
   The meeting will mark the first time the Pakistan government has
sought direct contact with its opposition since President Gen.
Mohammad Zia Ul-haq seized power and imposed martial in July 1977
coup.
   Pakistan has represented Afghanistan's anti-Marxist Moslem
guerrillas in the peace talks.
   The two sides agreed Thursday to a nine-month timetable for the
pullout of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, with half the estimated
115,000 troops to be withdrawn in the first 90 days.
   U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez said no major differences remained.
But the negotiators did not resolve the issue of what government
would be in power in Afghanistan to oversee implementation of a
settlement.
   Over the weekend, Pakistan will try to decide whether it is
willing to sign a settlement with President Najib's government,
which it does not recognize.
   Noorani said there was no change in Pakistan's position that the
settlement should be accompanied by formation of a transitional
government in Kabul to prevent more bloodshed.
   Not all opposition parties have declared their stand on
Afghanistan but most have urged the government to sign a Soviet
pullout accord, then worry about a political settlement later.
   The Geneva talks are set to resume Monday.
   Cordovez told reporters that that the withdrawal issue had long
stalled the almost 6-year-old negotiations. He said its resolution
meant a ``significant step'' toward concluding a settlement.
   ``I am not going to consider that these documents are absolutely
ready until they are signed and sealed,'' he said, but also stated
repeatedly that the ``remaining differences are not of substance.''
   ``There is no doubt about the political significance of the
agreements reached this week and also of some understandings that
have started to evolve'' regarding other oustanding problems, he
said.
   He did not elaborate but made plain that he is increasingly
confident that there will be an eventual accord on the future shape
of the Kabul government.
   Cordovez said that both Kabul and Islamabad recognized that a
broad-based Afghan government would make a settlement ``more
effective,'' although their concepts differ.
   He also said he believed that the Afghan resistance movement,
which is flatly opposed to any power-sharing with the present
leadership, will change its attitude once a settlement is complete.
   The chief Afghan delegate, Abdul Wakil, reiterated Thursday that
Kabul was ready to talk with all political forces, including the
resistance movements, about the formation of new government.
   A three-member team from the office of the U.N. Commissioner for
Refugees returned to Geneva today from a fact-finding visit in
Afghanistan.
   A spokeswoman, Judith Kumin, said the team followed an
invitation of the Kabul government. She said it was evident that
the office would have a role in repatriating the more than 5
million Afghan refugees once a settlement was reached.
   An estimated 3 million refugees are in Pakistan, and another 2
million are in Iran.

   Police today dragged away dozens of
protesters demanding the release of political prisoners and trying
to march into the presidential mansion.
   About 30 family members of imprisoned dissidents gathered in
front of the Blue House, the presidential residence, demanding an
interview with President Roh Tae-woo.
   Riot police took away the protesters, who shouted
anti-government slogans and tried to march into the residence.
   At Seoul National University, about 200 students called for the
release of political prisoners and denounced a recent government
amnesty as insufficient.
   The government released about 130 political prisoners last
Saturday, saying only dissidents guilty of violent crimes or
subversion remained in prison.
   The Joong-ang Ilbo, an influential Seoul newspaper, said the
freed dissidents are under surveillance and that their daily
activities were reported to security authorities.
   Also today, the governing and opposition parties resolved their
differences over electoral rules and other issues, clearing the way
for National Assembly elections expected in mid-April.
   In addition, senior officials of the two main opposition
parties, controlled by Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, agreed on
basic rules for their merger before the balloting.
   In December's presidential election, the two Kims split the
opposition vote. Roh won with 36.6 percent of the vote.
   The officials said after a three-hour meeting that they would
propose the elections be held under a system picking one lawmaker
instead of two in each district.
   The governing Democratic Justice Party welcomed the opposition
proposal.
   The governing party, which had favored a system electing one to
three members in each district depending on the size of population,
changed its position today on the order of the president.
   Before today's meeting, the opposition camp was itself divided
over the election formula, forcing a delay in adopting the new laws
needed before balloting can be held.
   The proposed reform would increase the overall number of
legislators from 271 to 300 by increasing the number of districts.

<TEXT>
   The government today decreed a ban on
smoking in public places and launched a campaign to try to convince
this nation of smokers to give up the habit.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez also
outlawed the selling of tobacco to anyone under 16.
   The ban will take effect in July, three months after its
publication in the official state bulletin. It was in keeping with
directives issued by the European Economic Community.
   Representatives of Spain's tobacco industry agreed to accept a
complete ban on television advertising and restrictions limiting
outdoor advertising to the name of their brand.
   According to EEC statistics, 41 percent of Spain's 38.8 million
people smoke, the second highest figure in the 12-nation community
after Greece.
   The same statistics indicate about 60,000 Spaniards die each
year from smoking-related diseases.
   The decree requires cigarette and cigar packages to carry the
warning that smoking causes cancer and endangers the life of the
smoker as well as unborn babies.
   It bans smoking in hospitals, department stores, elevators and
places where pregnant women work and prohibits the sale of tobacco
products to minors under 16.
   The decree says that the rights of non-smokers over those of
smokers will take priority in all legal questions. It carries fines
on infractions ranging from $4,400 to $880,000, but its enforcement
mechanism remains unclear.
   Spanish explorers who traveled to Central and South America in
the 16th century returned with string-tied rolls of tobacco leaves
that became the rage among their wealthy countrymen under the name
``cigar.''
   Etymologists believe the word comes from ``sik'ar,'' the term
the Mayan Indians of Central America used for smoking.
   ``Cigarillos'' or ``little cigars'' were devised by street
beggars in Seville from the butts of cast-off cigars and are the
forerunners of today's cigarettes.

   The government will hold an
unprecedented meeting with its political opposition to discuss
whether Pakistan should sign a peace accord with Afghanistan,
officials said today.
   Saturday's meeting will mark the first time the Pakistan
government has sought direct contact with the opposition since
before July 1977, when President Gen. Mohammad Zia Ul-haq seized
power and imposed martial law.
   Officials said nearly all 19 parties have accepted an invitation
to meet with Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo.
   The chief of the Pakistani delegation to the U.N. Afghanistan
talks in Geneva, Foreign State Minister Zain Noorani, was to return
to Islamabad today, after the third day of indirect negotiations
with the communist Afghan government.
   Pakistani officials said Junejo wanted to discuss whether
Pakistan should link an accord over a Soviet troop withdrawal from
Afghanistan with the formation of an interim coalition government
in Kabul.
   About 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan. The Soviets have
been fighting Afghan rebels since 1979 when they entered the
country and replaced the existing communist government with another
one.
   Almost all opposition leaders pledged to attend the
extraordinary meeting except Pakistan People's Party leader Benazir
Bhutto, who was reported ill with influenza. Her Karachi office
said she would at least fly to Islamabad to consult with her
representatives.
   Ms. Bhutto's father, ousted Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
was hanged in 1979 after he was convicted of plotting a political
murder.
   Zia lifted martial law on Dec. 30, 1985, after the installation
of Junejo's Muslim League government the previous March.
   Most opposition parties boycotted the election that brought
Junejo to power and still refuse to recognize his government.
   Pakistan's largest opposition alliance, the nine-party Movement
for the Restoration of Democracy, decided to accept the
government's gesture because it was not founded in protest over
foreign policy, said Sheikh Rafiq Ahmed, an official in Mrs.
Bhutto's party.
   Not all opposition parties have declared their stand on
Afghanistan but most have urged the government to sign a Soviet
pullout accord, then worry about a political settlement later.
   In a recent turnabout, Pakistan has threatened not to sign a
Geneva accord that does not provide a safe environment for the
return of the 5 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and Iran.
   Islamabad has said it fears that the Soviets' absence will clear
the way for a new bloody internecine struggle between the
pro-Moscow government of President Najib and Afghan Moslem
guerrillas, based in Pakistan.
   Saturday's meeting could give the Pakistanis a face-saving
pretext to soften their controversial stance at Geneva. It also
could serve to enhance the Muslim League government's own
legitimacy at home.

   About half the city's ambulance workers
scheduled for the day shift called in sick today, but police and
supervisory employees were helping fill gaps in service, the city
said.
   The Emergency Medical Service instituted a contingency plan to
meet the job action, which had been announced in advance as a
demonstration for higher pay.
   Sick calls were received from 176 of 347 workers on the day
shift, said Suzanne Halpin of the Health and Hospitals Corp.,
parent of EMS and operator of the municipal hospitals system.
   ``The employees calling in are being told they may be violating
a court order and the Taylor Law,'' she said. Penalties ranging
from loss of two days' pay to dismissal were possible. The Taylor
Law is a state law that prohibits strikes by public employees.
   Some of the gaps in ambulance service were being filled by
police and other EMS employees, including supervisors, Halpin said.
   The sickout, which was announced as a one-day protest, was
barred Thursday afternoon by Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner,
who ruled that EMS workers could not stage ``any kind of concerted
job action.''
   The decision to stage a sickout was made by about 400 workers in
a vote taken Wednesday night while union leaders were kept out of
the meeting.
   The 2,000-member union, without a contract since July, has
demanded salary and benefits comparable to police and firefighters,
whose starting pay is $26,000, said Richard Burstein, the union
secretary-treasurer.
   The union has asked that EMS starting pay of $21,500 be raised
by $6,000 over three years; the city is offering $600.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
investigating its own offices in Atlanta because NRC internal
documents involving an investigation of Georgia Tech's reactor
program were found at Tech, a newspaper reported today.
   Leaks from the NRC may have tipped Tech to the identities of
employees at the school's Neely Nuclear Research Center who had
complained about lax safety procedures, The Atlanta Constitution
said, quoting unidentified sources with Congress and the NRC.
   The two employees, members of the physics staff responsible for
safety of nuclear materials, were dismissed and then rehired and
given other jobs by Tech three weeks ago. They claim they were
fired because they complained to the NRC about reactor safety.
   NRC officials in Washington declined to comment.
   Dr. Nelson Grace, administrator of NRC's Southeast regional
office in Atlanta, acknowledged he had asked the agency's office of
inspector-auditor to ``investigate to determine whether or not
internal NRC documents may have come into the possession of'' a
reactor manager.
   Grace declined to name the reactor, but the Constitution quoted
other unidentified sources as confirming that it was the now-idled
five-megawatt reactor at Tech.
   Georgia Tech President John P. Crecine ordered the reactor out
of service until the NRC investigation is completed.

<TEXT>
   The Baltimore City School Board has banned
telephone beepers because school officials said they were being
used by students acting as go-betweens in drug deals.
   Effective March 14, students found carrying a beeper face
suspension, under the new policy adopted by the board Thursday.
   School officials say the telephone pagers are a status symbol in
the drug world, and are also used by students who want to portray
the image of being involved in narcotics.
   ``When I see a beeper I assume the worst,'' said Arthur Pierce,
principal of Francis M. Wood High School. ``At the high school and
middle school level, if a child is in possession of an operational
beeper, they are usually dealing drugs.
   `At the elementary level, kids are wearing inoperative beepers
to appear tough or macho and mimic the older kids. And that's not
something to encourage,'' said Pierce, who has been confiscating
the pagers at his school for the past three years.
   Beepers also were banned from schools in Nashville, Tenn., in
December. Similar problems have been reported from Florida to
Michigan.
   Virtually all drug possession arrests in Baltimore schools
involve marijuana, said Larry Burgan, school police chief, with a
few instances of cocaine or cocaine derivatives.
   ``From my standpoint, I don't see any time a student would need
to carry a beeper,'' said Burgan. ``It's basically a disruptive
influence, whether the kids are carrying them to traffic drugs or
just to project that image, it's no good.''
   Pierce said it is hard to determine the scope of the problem
because most beepers go undetected.
   New beepers no longer emit the three short beeps from which
their name was derived.
   ``The more sophisticated ones vibrate against the body or are
fitted with a silencer that keeps them from being detected,''
Pierce said.
   Burgan said the drug problem is kept under control largely
because city high schools have officers patrolling the halls.

<HEAD>Tower Of Windsor Castle Damaged By Shifting Foundations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 800-year-old Round Tower at Windsor
Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II's homes, has been damaged by
shifting foundations, the Department of the Environment said today.
   The castle overlooking the River Thames is reportedly the
queen's favorite home and is one of Britain's top tourist
attractions. The monarch's royal standard is flown from the tower
when she is in residence.
   ``There has been a slight movement to the Round Tower at Windsor
Castle. We are looking into it,'' the government department said in
a brief statement.
   The statement added that the cause was not known and gave no
details about the extent of the damage.
   The Daily Telegraph, which first broke the story, described the
damage to the five-story tower as serious following a shift in its
ancient foundations.
   The London newspaper said the tower moved two weeks ago,
bringing down plaster, causing cracks to appear in the stonework
and jamming a door and two windows.
   It said the queen had inspected the tower. Buckingham Palace
said in a statement: ``The queen is obviously concerned and is
being kept informed.''
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, live for much of the
year at Buckingham Palace in London but they and their family spend
each Christmas at Windsor Castle. Windsor is 21 miles west of
London.
   The Round Tower is the most imposing feature of the castle. The
foundations of the tower and the rest of its lower part were built
by King Henry II in 1172. The upper part was added 6{ centuries
later in the reign of King George IV.
   The Round Tower is built on a mound thrown up by the Saxons, the
Teutonic invaders who conquered Britain between the 5th and 7th
centuries. They ruled until their army under King Harold was beaten
at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by Duke William of Normandy, who
then became King William I of England.
   The original castle was built by King William around 1070.

   The Senate, kept in the dark by the Reagan
administration during the Iran-Contra affair, today rejected an
effort to let the White House withhold details about covert actions
from Congress.
   The 65-23 vote came as the chamber worked on a bill requiring
that Congress be notified of all covert actions within 48 hours.
   The decision came on an amendment by Sen. James McClure,
R-Idaho, that would have allowed a president simply to tell
Congress that a covert action was underway but withhold details and
specifics until later.
   ``This is a compromise. It gives the president some
flexibility,'' said McClure.
   But Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, chief author of the bill,
opposed McClure, telling his colleagues, ``This is not a
compromise; it's a capitulation. ... This lets the president play
`I've got a secret' but not tell.''
   ``This cannot guarantee that future abuses such as Iran-Contra
will not occur, but it will certainly minimize them,'' Cohen,
vice-chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said late Thursday as
debate began.
   The bill overhauls procedures for notifying Congress about
intelligence activites. The central feature would require that
Congress be notified within 48 hours of the time a covert, or
secret, action begins.
   Cohen suggested that the requirement could have helped expose
the Iran-Contra affair, in which U.S. weapons were sold to Iran and
some of the profits were diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Reagan's approval of the Iranian arms deal was withheld from
Congress for 10 months in 1986, until it was revealed by a Beirut
publication.
   CIA Director William Webster, testifying last month to the House
Intelligence Committee, said the 48-hour notification requirement
``will not be acceptable to the president.'' But Webster did not
say whether Reagan would veto the bill.
   Cohen noted that presidents normally have notified Congress of
most covert actions ever since congressional review committees were
created 14 years ago in the wake of revelations about a series of
abuses by the CIA.
   He said it is time to close the last loophole by requiring
notification of all such actions.
   ``The Iran-Contra affair shows what happens when a president
seeks to circumvent Congress,'' Cohen said.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, called the measure ``landmark legislation.''
   Reagan has promised to notify Congress about future covert
actions, but Boren said, ``We feel a need to put these changes into
statute'' to make sure a president does not go back on his word.
   ``We do not want our country ever again to go through what it
did these last few months because of the Iran-Contra affair,''
Boren said.
   ``There's an old saying that two heads are better than one''
said Boren. ``In the Intelligence Committee, we try to give those
in the intelligence community our best judgment.''
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, opposed the bill because he said
the notification provision ``could endanger American lives and the
lives of others who have taken the risk of assisting the United
States.''
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., agreed with McClure. ``This bill
will cost lives,'' he said.
   The bill was approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee last
December on a 13-2 vote. If passed by the full Senate, it will need
House approval before it would go to Reagan's desk.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Nationalist legislators today
asked the Taiwan government to drop its 40-year-old policy of
having no contact with the communist government in Beijing.
   Huang Shu-wek, one of the 12 lawmakers questioning the
no-contact policy during a Legislative Yuan session, proposed a
``temporary two-China policy'' to precede eventual reunification.
   Huang said the Taipei and Beijing governments must ``compete on
an equal footing so we can show all Chinese people the achievements
of Taiwan's development and let them accept our system.''
   Huang proposed that the Nationalist government provide financial
and technological aid for China's modernization and discuss
bilateral trade and other relations with Beijing.
   The two countries already have a secret trade estimated at more
than $1 billion a year through third parties such as Hong Kong and
Singapore. Taiwan recently began allowing its citizens to visit
their families on the mainland.
   The Nationalists have refused official contacts with China since
1949 when they fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war on the
mainland to the communists. Both governments claim to be the
rightful government of the mainland and Taiwan.
   Premier Yu Kuo-hwa said in response that ``communist China has
never treated us equally and the time has not yet come for peaceful
competition'' between the two governments.
   Yao Chia-wen, chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, said, ``We don't care too much about the Nationalists' claim
to represent China.''
   Dozens of political activists held a torch-light run today
through downtown Taipei echoing the demands of President Lee
Tung-hi that elderly Nationalist Chinese legislators elected on the
mainland four decades ago should retire.
   ``This is the time for our elderly legislators to step down.
Most of those who voted for them 40 years ago on the mainland have
already died,'' opposition legislator You Ching told about 100
people outside the National Assembly after the run.
   Led by legislator Chu Kao-cheng of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, about 60 runners began at the Legislative Yuan
building and finished an hour later outside the National Assembly,
where opposition leaders delivered speeches from a pickup truck.
   Many elderly members of the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's highest
lawmaking body, and the National Assembly, the electoral college,
have rejected a proposal for them to retire voluntarily.
   Last Saturday Lee urged the elderly legislators to resign in
accordance with the government's plans to reform Taiwan's political
system.
   ``We must place national interests and public welfare above our
personal opinions,'' Lee told the National Assembly.
   Lawmakers elected on Taiwan now account for 73 members of the
312-seat Legislative Yuan and 106 members of the 934-seat National
Assembly.
   The other seats are either empty or held by aging Nationalists.
   Opposition leaders said the elderly legislators, who have been
frozen in office to support the Nationalists' claim to be the
legitimate government of mainland China, should yield their seats
so all lawmakers can be elected in Taiwan.
   During the run, some activists distributed flyers listing
telephone numbers of 120 aging assemblymen. Chu has urged Taiwanese
to call elderly lawmakers and ask them to retire.

   An engineer testifying in Delta Air
Lines suit against the government used an animated videotape
recreating the final two minutes of Delta Flight 191 in an attempt
to disprove government claims that the flight crew could have
escaped a violent wind shear.
   Charles Bautz, a performance engineering manager for the
Atlanta-based airline, testified Thursday that the pilots reacted
properly to the turbulent winds during their approach to
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Aug. 2, 1985.
   In a non-jury trial being heard by U.S. District Judge David O.
Belew Jr. of Fort Worth, Delta contends that the federal government
should bear legal responsibility for the crash and pay all or part
of more than $90 million in death, injury and damage claims Delta
has paid in connection with the crash.
   Bautz, who worked as a member of a government technical team
investigating the crash, presented the videotape recreation based
on recorded flight data, which he said shows the crew encountered a
second, fatal wind shear seconds after pulling out of the first
downdraft.
   The co-pilot applied maximum power and attempted to abandon the
landing, Bautz said.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigation said the
crash that killed 137 people and injured 25 others was caused, in
part, by the sudden downdrafts of wind.
   The airline claims government air traffic controllers and
weather forecasters failed to warn the flight crew of the storm.
   Testimony in the trial could last several more weeks, attorneys
said.

   Crocodiles in Zambia's Kafue River have

have asked the authorities to shoot the reptiles, a local official
said today.
   Dickson Ponde, chairman of Kasiba Ward council in the central
Copperbelt province, called for immediate action to stop the
crocodiles, which he said are attacking several people each week.
   The five deaths occurred since the beginning of the year. Ponde
made his plea to Rankin Sikasula, a senior member of President
Kenneth Kaunda's governing party, when he was inspecting a pontoon
bridge on the Kafue river.
   Sikasula promised that hunters will soon be sent to the area to
reduce the crocodile population.

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis today
promised to pursue economic and energy policies to help Texas
``come back and come back strong,'' including expanded natural gas
sales to Northeast states.
   In a speech to 300 people in this west Texas city before flying
on to Denver, Cheyenne and Seattle, Dukakis said the natural gas of
the Southwest could provide ``clean, efficient, non-polluting,
non-acid rain energy'' at a quarter of the cost of nuclear energy
from the controversial unlicensed Seabrook, N.H., plant that he
opposes.
   Dukakis, wrapping up a two-day, 1,200-mile swing through the
state with the biggest Super Tuesday prize, promised he would help
Texas' distressed oil industry ``come back and come back strong.''
   On Thursday, Dukakis said the last few days to Super Tuesday may
get ``a little dicey'' because of what he characterized as
desperate tactics by Democratic rival Richard Gephardt. The
Missouri congressman has runs ads accusing Dukakis of favoring tax
increases and knowing nothing about agriculture.
   Dukakis has responded in kind with ads suggesting Gephardt has
voted to protect the interests of big banks and corporations from
which he has collected political action committee money.
   After a meeting with community organizers at a church hall in
Houston Thursday night, Dukakis told reporters, ``I think the next
three, four days may be somewhat difficult, only because things may
start getting a little dicey between now and Tuesday...I think some
people are getting desperate.''
   Asked if he meant Gephardt, Dukakis said, ``The record is clear.
He's running negative ads right now.
   ``The folks that attack are usually those that are behind,'' he
said.
   To Gephardt's charge that Dukakis has accepted campaign money
from businesses that have major dealings with the state of
Massachusetts, the governor replied, ``I don't know what he's
talking about. I have over 65,000 individual contributors to my
campaign.''
   Dukakis, who refuses to accept money from PACs, said he has
never taken contributions from state lobbyists, or more than $100
from a state employee.
   ``What is clear is that the PAC system is a very bad system. ...
It's time it ended,'' said Dukakis, who blamed Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas, a Republican presidential hopeful, and his GOP colleagues
for filibustering a bill to curb PAC contributions.
   ``If I'm president of the United States, the first bill I will
send to the Congress is the (campaign contributions) bill,'' he
vowed.
   Texas offers the biggest prize, 183 delegates, and Dukakis was
headed back to San Antonio Saturday night after stops in Spokane
and Little Rock, Ark.
   He picked up endorsements Thursday from Washington Gov. Booth
Gardener and Sen. Brock Adams.
   Dukakis also won the backing of the 95,000-member Texas State
Teachers Association, which withdrew its earlier endorsement of
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who is for the most part sitting out the
South's primaries.
   Dukakis charged Gephardt's retaliatory trade legislation could
provoke a global trade war and harm U.S.-Mexican relations.
   Before largely Hispanic audiences at airport rallies in the
border towns of Harlingen and Laredo, Dukakis related how Gephardt
asked him in a recent debate if he was running for ``president of
Mexico.''
   ``I said, `Dick, if I'm president of the United States, I'm
going to pay attention to our relationship with Mexico and I'm
going to make sure that our proposals do not wreck the economy of
Mexico,'' Dukakis said to cheers.
   ``We're going to .. work with our neighbors in Mexico as
partners to create opportunity on both sides of the border.''
   In both Harlingen and Laredo, the multilingual Dukakis, who grew
up speaking Greek and English _ spoke at length in Spanish.
   In Houston, Dukakis stood with his wife, Kitty, before a
two-story Lone Star flag draped against the glass elevators in the
atrium of the Hyatt-Regency Hotel. He told 600 supporters: ``I
don't have to tell you how important `Super Martes' is.''
   He ended his appeals with this: ``Poco a poco, paso a paso, mano
en mano, juntos, vamos a ganar,'' or, as he translated, ``Little by
little, step by step, hand in hand, together, we shall succeed.''

<HEAD>Union Recommends Acceptance of Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Cleveland Teachers Union has recommended
that its 5,100 members ratify a tentative agreement reached after a
weeklong strike that closed city schools for most of the district's
73,000 students.
   Schools were closed today but probably will reopen Monday,
Superintendent Alfred Tutela said.
   The school board scheduled a meeting for Saturday night to
consider ratifying the agreement and discuss plans for reopening
the schools, he said.
   Eugene Kolach, president of the teachers union, said the union's
executive board voted Thursday night to endorse the pact, which was
reached earlier after nearly 24 hours of negotiations.
   ``Our executive board has voted to suspend our strike beginning
Monday,'' Kolach said. ``It's not a case of being happy with the
pact, it's a case of understanding when we've gotten the best
possible situation.''
   Both sides declined to discuss the terms of the agreement until
after teachers vote on it. Kolach said the union planned a five-day
voting period for its 5,093 members following an information
meeting Sunday.
   Teachers walked off their jobs Feb. 25, but district officials
canceled classes that day because of snow. Cleveland schools have
been closed since then because of the strike, except for classes
that began Wednesday for some of the district's 3,600 high school
seniors.
   At least some of the missed school days will have to be made up
to meet state requirements.
   The union's contract expired in September, but union members
continued working. The district's teacher salaries range from
$17,600 to $37,450, based on education and experience. The average
annual salary is $29,500.
   The last teachers' strike in Cleveland, Ohio's largest school
district and the 30th largest school system in the United States,
was an 11-week walkout in 1979.

   Militant Sikhs burst into a courtyard
and opened fire on a crowd celebrating a Hindu holiday, killing at
least 34 people and wounding about 45, police said today.
   The attack in the northern state of Punjab was one of the
bloodiest since Sikh extremists launched their guerrilla war for an
independent homeland there in 1982. It occurred shortly before
midnight.
   A. Siddiqui, a deputy inspector general of police, said most of
the victims were Hindus, but nine Sikhs were among those killed.
   About 900 Hindus, Sikhs and Christians had gathered outside a
Hindu temple to celebrate Holi, the festival of color. The national
holiday commemorates the triumph of the Hindu god Lord Krishna over
evil.
   The attack brought to more than 370 the number of people killed
this year in attacks blamed on Sikh extremists. Sikhs are a
religious minority in India and claim they are discriminated
against by the majority Hindus.
   In an apparent peace overture today, the government freed four
Sikh high priests. The release of 40 Sikh militants was also
planned, the United News of India reported from the Punjab state
capital of Chandigarh.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in
Kari Sari, which is about 80 miles east of the Sikh holy city of
Amritsar. Police blamed the Kalistan Commando Force. Kalistan is
the name Sikh militants would given to their envisioned nation.
   Mahavir Prashad, who was inside a building and escaped injury,
said:, ``People ran helter-skelter. There were bodies on the
ground, and the injured were crying.
   ``I tried to save some of the injured by giving them water, but
most of them died in my arms.''
   Siddiqui, addressing a news conference in the nearby town of
Hoshiarpur, said the shooting lasted about 20 minutes. He said six
to eight gunmen participated.
   Brij Kishore, deputy superintendent of police at Chandigarh, the
state capital, said villagers had gathered around two bonfires and
were singing songs when the gunmen drove up in three cars, opened
fire with AK-47 assault rifles and machine guns, and fled.
   Police said 23 people were killed on the spot and 11 others
taken to hospitals died later of their injuries.
   Punjab security forces and New Delhi police were put on alert
after the killing to prevent any backlash.
   The attack was the worst in Punjab since last July, when Sikh
gunmen waylaid three buses and slaughtered 72 people, most of them
Hindus. Thirty-eight Hindu pilgrims were killed and 24 injured July
6 when a bus was attacked near Chandigarh. The next day, 34 people
died in attacks on two buses in neighboring Haryana state.
   Among the priests released today was Jasbir Singh Rode, a nephew
of the late Sikh radical leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.
   The other three are Jaswant Singh, Kashmir Singh and Savinder
Singh, who were arrested in October.
   Rode was the chief priest at the Golden Temple in Amritsar when
he was arrested during a June 1984 army raid that drove militants
out of the temple, the Sikh's holiest shrine. Bhindranwale was
among the 1,200 killed in the raid.
   Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who ordered the raid, was
assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards four months later. Her
son and successor, Rajiv Gandhi, signed a peace accord with Sikh
leaders in July 1985 to try to end the hostility. The accord later
fell apart.
   On Thursday night, Punjab representatives from Parliament met
with leaders of Gandhi's party and urged freedom for the priests
``so they can use their high position to restore normalcy'' in
Punjab, UNI reported.

   The National Research Council said today its
14-month review of the Challenger disaster has found ``no
show-stoppers'' to prevent NASA from resuming manned space flights
in August.
   ``We are all quite comfortable with what has been done to get
ready for the next flight,'' said Alton D. Slay, a retired general
who headed a 12-member committee that audited the space agency's
efforts to recover from the accident.
   But, he cautioned, ``no matter how good you are, you never reach
Mecca; there is always room for improvement.''
   The committee's central finding, he said, is that NASA has the
ability to assess and manage risks associated with space flights,
but uses so many review boards and safety organizations that the
result is ``a fragmented picture of the safety and reliability of
the total space transportation system.''
   Further, he said, those organizations rely on subjective
assessements of risk posed by thousands of individual space shuttle
components, rather than on engineering evaluations.
   ``We are both favorably impressed with NASA's progress thus far
in addressing space shuttle safety issues and full of suggestions
for further improvements,'' Slay said.
   ``Although we have criticisms, we did not find anything that
will delay the next space shuttle launch,'' said Slay, a former
head of the U.S. Air Force Systems Command. Launch of the shuttle
Discovery is scheduled Aug. 4.
   Slay praised NASA for having made ``real strides'' in enhancing
the safety of the shuttle and said ``we found no show-stoppers.''
   In a brief response, the space agency said it acted on early
drafts of the committee's report ``and most of the recommendations
made by the council essentially are in place.''
   The NRC review was recommended by the presidential commission
that investigated the Jan. 28, 1986 accident that destroyed the
Challenger and killed its crew 73 seconds after liftoff. The NRC
acts as a scientific advisory group to the federal government and
is administered by the National Academy of Sciences, the National
Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
   ``As the Challenger accident made painfully obvious, no probe
into space is routine and the space shuttle is still a
developmental vehicle,'' said the NRC committee. ``The risks of
space flight must be accepted by those who are asked to participate
in each flight as well as by those who are responsible to the
nation for achieving its goals in space.''
   The report said that one of the key failures that led to the
Challenger disaster was that the history of problems with the
shuttle booster O-rings was not known by the officials who gave the
go-ahead for the ill-fated launch. An O-ring that allowed hot gases
to escape was blamed for the accident.
   ``The committee has found numerous indications that data from
STS (Space Transportation System) inspection, test and repair, and
inflight operations do not always feed back rapidly enough or
effectively enough into the risk management process,'' the report
said.
   It noted that NASA now intends to review all data from each
flight before going ahead with the next one, at least during the
shuttle's initial flights. But the committee worried that once the
pace increases ``the same dangerous preconditions will once again
be present.''
   The number of items deemed to be of ``criticality 1 and 1R'' _
items whose failure could doom the shuttle _ has increased from
2,369 before the Challenger accident to 4,686 because of
re-evaluation of the shuttle system and tighter ground rules, the
committee said.
   But, said the committee, all criticality 1 items are not alike
and NASA is wrong in not assigning priorities.
   ``The most likely and most threatening failure modes merit the
most attention,'' said the report.
   The committee found:
   _NASA tends to focus on ``single-event, worst case failures'' in
making risk analyses and ``there does not appear to be an adequate
integrated-system view of the entire STS.''
   _Before the Challenger accident, cannibalization of parts from
one shuttle to another was routine, introducing greater chance of
failure through human error. The committee recommended that enough
money be available ``to ensure that cannibalization is a rare
requirement.''
   _So many boards and panels are watching every aspect of the
shuttle system that individuals might ``defer to the anonymity of
the process'' and not take responsibility for decisions.
   _Tests on the solid rocket booster are performed at the
manufacturing plant in Utah and there is a risk that damage may
result from the long rail trip to the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida. The committee recommended that ``non-destructive tests'' _
tests that stop short of firing the rocket _ be performed at the
launch site.

<TEXT>
   Urban planners eager to revitalize aging
industrial centers are urging city dwellers to take charge of their
own future, and are looking to Britain's Prince Charles to drive
that message home.
   Charles arrived today in cold and rainy to take part in an
international architectural symposium and get a first-hand look at
the despair and disrepair of once-mighty U.S. steel towns.
   ``We see him as somewhat of a catalyst'' for urban renewal
efforts from within, said Volker Hartkopf, an architecture
professor at Carnegie Mellon University here.
   The Prince of Wales has emerged as an outspoken advocate of
community architecture and inner-city rehabilitation over the past
few years.
   He made worldwide headlines in December when he accused
architects of wreaking more havoc on London than German bombers did
in World War II, and said postwar planners were artless, mediocre
and contemptuous of public opinion.
   ``More than anyone else in his position, he has tried to find
out for himself exactly what it (urban decay) is because he is
concerned,'' said Roger Tillotson, lecturer at the University of
Newcastle upon Tyne in England.
   Prince Charles is honorary chairman of the four-day Remaking
Cities Conference, which is exploring ways to bring prosperity back
to depressed communities in the United States and Britain.
   This afternoon, he plans to visit a new jobs center for the
region's blue-collar unemployed and a high school computer training
classroom.
   On the conference's last day Saturday, he is to address about
350 people attending the symposium sponsored by the American
Institute of Architects and Royal Institute of British Architects.
   In his speech, the 39-year-old heir to the British throne is
expected to comment on recommendations made by conference delegates
for helping cities move from single-industry to more diversified
economies.
   ``Before, like it or not, companies took care of life. You may
not have liked everything they did. But they were there. It was
secure,'' said John Clarke, a Trenton, N.J., architect.
   ``But when that goes away, suddenly you turn around and say,
`Gee, the leadership used to be the company.' Now the leadership
has to be you,'' said Clarke, who led a 17-member study of the
region's depressed steel towns.
   In its 120-page report presented Monday, the team stressed the
need for public participation in replacing the darkened factories
dominating the Monongahela River banks parks, gardens, marinas and
shops.
   ``That valley is a gold mine, and I think these people would be
fools not to take up the opportunity,'' said team member Tony
McGann, a planner from Liverpool, England. ``It's a golden
opportunity that might not come again.''

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
unanimously today for a resolution urging the Reagan administration
to end all contacts with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and to
consider imposing economic sanctions against his military regime in
Panama.
   But the committee took no action on legislation introduced on
Thursday and co-sponsored by 25 senators which would impose a total
trade embargo on Panama in an effort to break Noriega's hold on the
country.
   The 15-0 committee vote approving the non-binding resolution
came after administration officials, seeking to avoid passage of
trade embargo legislation, proposed a set of milder alternatives
that still would penalize the Noriega regime.
   National Security Adviser Colin Powell told reporters Thursday
night that several economic and financial measures were being
prepared for consideration by President Reagan, but he refused to
be more specific.
   Other officials, insisting on anonymity, said the administration
believes a bipartisan congressional proposal for a trade, air,
travel and currency embargo against Panama would be unwise.
   The administration believes U.S. interests would be better
served if Noriega were ousted primarily by Panamanian _ and not
American _ pressure.
   The officials said displays of American heavy-handedness could
be used by Noriega to his advantage and could produce resentment
elsewhere in Latin America, where U.S. intervention has long been a
popular anti-American rallying cry.
   The committee resolution declares that Eric Arturo Devalle, who
was ousted by the Panamanian parliament after trying to fire
Noriega as commander of Panama's armed forces, remains the
country's legitimate head of state and should reeceive ``the full
moral, political and diplomatic support of the government of the
United States.''
   It called on the White House to ``formally terminate any and all
contacts with Gen. Noriega.''
   ``The government of the United States should consider further
measures to support democracy (in Panama), including economic
sanctions, in the event Gen. Noriega continues to defy President
Devalle's lawful order,'' the resolution declared.
   It also called on the White House to study the impact on U.S.
energy supplies if Noriega reacts to possible economic sanctions by
shutting down the trans-Panama petroleum pipeline used to transport
Alaskan oil to the east coast of the United States.
   For Noriega, Panamanian independence from the United States has
been his principal line of defense in his struggle to survive. It
was a recurring theme at a pro-government demonstration in Panama
earlier this week when a crowd of 3,000 turned out to cheer Noriega.
   Shortly before Powell made his comments to reporters while
returning with Reagan from the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium,
six Republicans and Democrats introduced the embargo bill.
   It would prohibit all trade and air travel between the two
countries and bar U.S. banks from transferring any funds to Panama
and its banking system.
   ``By stopping the transfer of funds from U.S. banks to Panama,
we go for the jugular,'' said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., a
principal sponsor of the embargo plan.
   ``Because of Panama's heavy reliance on its economic ties with
the United States, the impact of a U.S. trade embargo would be
immediate, dramatic and devastating to Noriega and his cohorts,''
D'Amato said.
   A ban on Panamanian goods would paralyze a $412 million market
representing 60 percent of Panama's total exports, D'Amato said. A
ban on U.S. exports to Panama would affect a 30 percent slice of
all Panamanian imports, he said.
   Other sponsors of the embargo bill are Sens. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; John
Kerry, D-Mass.; and Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   The administration has been sending mixed signals about the
degree to which it is willing to pressure Noriega, who is under
federal indictment on drug smuggling charges and who forced out the
constitutionally elected president last week.
   Some officials are sensitive to charges that the administration
has not done enough to oppose Noriega while others believe broader
U.S. interests require a cautious approach.
   In any case, there appears to be a consensus within the
administration that a trade embargo is too ambitious a step. The
administration is hopeful a combination of other pressures will
force an end to Noriega's rule.
   The issue of whether to withhold a $7 million U.S. payment due
in mid-March to Panama for canal-related fees and services has
underscored the split in the administration.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams has said that the
administration will refuse to deliver the funds if such a request
is received from ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   But on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
said no final decision has been made on that issue even though the
administration has had the request in hand since earlier in the
week.
   She acknowledged, however, that the request probably will be
honored.
   With an assist from the administration, Panamanian authorities
apparently have been denied access to official funds on deposit in
U.S. banks.
   At a news conference Thursday night at the Panamanian Embassy,
an attorney for Delvalle said federal courts in New York and Boston
have issued temporary restraining orders to prevent withdrawal of
the funds.
   ``We believe that whatever funds are in those institutions are
at this point frozen and cannot be transmitted to the Noriega
regime,'' said Daniel Resnick, a Washington attorney.

   Most of the presidential candidates campaigned hard in the South
today, four days before the region's Super Tuesday primaries, but
Albert Gore Jr. detoured to Connecticut to raise money for a
Southern campaign that he said was turning in his direction.
   In Washington, meanwhile, attorneys for former Rep. Paul
McCloskey filed notice in court that they oppose Pat Robertson's
effort to drop a libel suit filed after McCloskey questioned his
war record.
   Unless a federal judge dismisses the case, as Robertson has
asked, a legal matter that has become a clear distraction for
Robertson could tie him up even further beginning on Tuesday when
the trial is scheduled to begin.
   In appearances today:
   _Vice President George Bush, campaigning in a state that votes
on Saturday, told a cheering crowd of 1,500 students in West
Columbia, S.C., ``Your state is going to have a mobilizing effect.
If we're successful in South Carolina, I think you'll be able to
say, the next president of the United States was here in our
school.''
   _Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, in Lubbock, Texas, told
voters in the biggest Super Tuesday state, he would to pursue
economic and energy policies to help Texas ``come back and come
back strong.''
   _Gore, in New Haven, Conn., raised an estimated $50,000 for his
campaign during a breakfast with state Democrats. He said there is
a shift going on to his advantage in Southern states, and ``the
undecided vote, which has been very large, is now breaking in our
direction.''
   Elsewhere, Richard Gephardt was gunning for Democratic rival
Dukakis over special-interest campaign contributions. And Robertson
lashed out Thursday night at what he called ``the real fanatics''
opposed to prayer in public schools.
   A poll published today gave Bush a big lead over Republican
opponent Bob Dole in South Carolina, whose GOP primary on Saturday
rings the opening bell on Tuesday's 20-state punchup.
   The Super Tuesday contests, with a prize of 1,307 Democratic
delegates and 712 Republican ones, are concentrated in the South.
   In South Carolina, Bush had the support of 49 percent of likely
voters to Dole's 26 percent, Robertson's 14 percent and Rep. Jack
Kemp's 7 percent, the Washington Post poll indicated.
   Kemp, battered by weak results in early contests, insisted he
has a shot at a respectable showing in South Carolina.
   ``I don't throw `Hail Mary' passes,'' said the former pro
football player as he campaigned Thursday in Columbia, S.C.
   Dole, who picked up the endorsement Thursday of former U.N.
ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, conceded he was running behind Bush
in South Carolina, but pointed to bright spots that day _ a caucus
in Wyoming, and the election of 14 national GOP delegates in
Kansas, Dole's home state.
   All four Republicans were campaigning in South Carolina today.
   Robertson bought half an hour of television time on stations
around the state Thursday night, saying he wanted to ``set the
record straight'' about religious issues.
   The former television evangelist said he believes in the
separation of church and state but added: ``The real fanatics in
America today are those who try to tell us ... that we should tear
down the crosses and the manger scenes at Christmas time, that our
children should be denied the right to pray in school and that
traditional moral values are out of style.''
   Meanwhile, more polls today pointed to a strong Southern lead
for Bush, while Dukakis and Jesse Jackson dueled for support among
Democrats.
   A CBS-New York Times survey gave Bush a better than 2-1 lead
over Dole in 14 Southern and border states. A survey by Cable News
Network and USA Today had similar findings.
   In the CBS-Times poll, Jackson led Dukakis and Tennessee Sen.
Gore in the South. The CNN-USA Today survey suggested Dukakis and
Jackson were neck-in-neck in the region.
   Dukakis, in Texas, attacked Gephardt's plan for mandatory
retaliation against countries whose trade practices are judged
unfair.
   ``There's always somebody who suggests that: throw up the walls,
hunker down,'' the Massachusetts governor said.
   Gephardt, for his part, sought to turn the tables on Dukakis,
who has been running ads excoriating the Missouri congressman for
accepting campaign contributions from the political action
committees of banks, defense contractors, utilities and other big
businesses.
   ``I'll give back every penny of money that I've gotten from
political action funds if he will return the money to all the
people who have given him money who do business with or are
licensed by the state of Massachusetts,'' Gephardt said.
   Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach said the campaign has taken no
money from any corporate PACs or registered lobbyists in
Massachusetts.
   Gephardt told reporters at a news conference at the
Baltimore-Washington airport that he would unveil today ``a partial
list of some of the interests that have given money to his
campaign.''
   ``He's got appointees of his own state government who are
awarding contracts to many of the people who have given money to
his campaign. Is that a conflict of interest?'' he said.
   Gephardt said his votes in the House have not been dictated by
special interests.
   The Missouri congressman, who had the House's worst attendance
record for roll call votes last year, was absent Thursday night as
the House, by a 216-208 vote, rejected a package of $30 million in
``humanitarian'' aid for Nicaragua's Contras.
   When the House voted on Contra aid last month, just prior to the
Iowa caucuses, Gephardt delivered the weekly Democratic radio
address on the subject a few days beforehand and made himself a
prominent figure in the House debate.

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geneticist Sewall Wright, known for his
pioneering studies of genetic changes in evolving species, died of
complications resulting from injuries sustained in a fall. He was
98.
   Wright, a professor emeritus at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, remained active until his death Thursday. He
published his last scientific paper in the January 1988 issue of
American Naturalist.
   He broke his pelvis Sunday when he slipped on an ice patch while
walking near his apartment.
   Wright advocated a mathematical theory of evolution; one of his
important theories was that chance happenings can have a
significant effect on modifying the gene pool.
   Wright received 10 honorary degrees and was awarded the Darwin
Medal, the National Medal of Science and, in 1984, the $100,000
Balzan Prize.
   ``He was one of the great thinkers in all of genetics and
evolution,'' said James Crow, a University of Wisconsin colleague
and longtime friend.
   ``He was responsible _ along with R.A. Fisher and J.S.B. Haldane
_ for our modern theory of evolution, selection and Mendelian
inheritance.''
   Wright, who was born in Melrose, Mass., was a faculty member at
the University of Chicago for 30 years until 1954, when he retired
from that school. He then accepted a position at UW-Madison, where
he has been emeritus professor of genetics since 1960.
   Wright is survived by two sons and a daughter.

<HEAD>Chinese Pottery Discovered at Historic Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British archaeologists discovered
fragments of 16th century Chinese porcelain at Iron Age ruins in
southeastern Zimbabwe, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The porcelain was unearthed by a 12-member research team at
Great Zimbabwe stone ruins of the 13th century tribal settlement
from which modern Zimbabwe draws its name. The find shows for the
first time that the site was occupied in the 16th century,
according to the newspaper, The Herald.
   Previous research indicated the ancestors of Zimbabwe's majority
Shona tribe abandoned the stone-built settlement by the year 1450.
   The Herald quoted archaeologists David Collett and Gwilyn Hughes
as saying the Chinese porcelain was probably brought to the African
interior by traders from Arab trading posts along the East African
coast.
   It proved that parts of the 1,720 acre ancient settlement, the
onetime capital of a vast tribal empire, were still occupied after
the year 1500, the expedition members said.

   An electrical problem struck a theater where the
musical ``Me and My Girl'' had just gotten under way, and the
audience of more than 1,000 had to be sent home when the show
couldn't go on.
   The problem at the Adelphi Theater on Thursday night developed
only 20 minutes into the show, as star Karl Howman was midway
through the title number, according to a statement from the theater.
   The unspecified problem couldn't be fixed immediately, the
statement said.
   Arrangements were being made to get the disappointed
theatergoers into other performances of the show, which is in its
fourth year playing to capacity crowds.
   ``Me and My Girl,'' about a Cockney from London's tough East End
who becomes an aristocrat, is a revival of the 1930s Noel Gay hit
which launched the song ``The Lambeth Walk'' that became part of
Cockney folklore.

<HEAD>Frat Kicked off Penn Campus for Hiring Strippers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Pennsylvania announced
Friday the 1{-year suspension of a fraternity that hired two black
strippers to perform at a party.
   Zeta Beta Tau ``will be permitted to return only if it meets
stringent requirements for its reorganization,'' said Penn
spokesman William Epstein.
   The exact terms have not been established, but Penn President
Sheldon Hackney said the first step is ``an immediate public
apology.''
   In a joint statement, Hackney and Provost Michael Aiken said the
charges against the fraternity ``were very serious and deserved the
significant sanctions that we are applying.''
   ``Behavior that dehumanizes any individual or group will not be
tolerated at Penn. Every one of us has a responsibility to help
build a community that values our diversity and the worth of each
individual.''
   Members of Zeta Beta Tau said that have been given until March
20 to move out. The 112-member, all-white fraternity will not be
allowed to pledge new members and will not be allowed to reapply
for recognition by the university until September 1989.
   ZBT President Zane Brown, in a statement, complained the
decision was unjust, but apologized for the rush party incident.
   The university charged the fraternity in February with engaging
in lewdness, indecent exposure and hazing through activities that
were ``indecent or shocking to moral or religious scruples.''
   The charges stemmed from a rush party in September, when two
black women stripped, performed sexually explicit acts and danced
naked with a prospective freshman pledge before an audience that
shouted racial epithets, according to the university.
   The fraternity had offered to pay a $2,500 fine to the campus
women's center, make a public apology and attend educational
programs on sexual harassment. But black student leaders said they
wanted ZBT expelled.

<TEXT>
   The Alabama Beverage Control Board is
making a mistake by planning to open a liquor store near a halfway
house for recovering alcoholics, say officials of the halfway
operation.
   The store, to open next month in downtown Tuscaloosa, is one
door away from the Phoenix House, which houses up to 17 men who are
trying to get off alcohol.
   ``I'm an alcoholic, and I went through the house eight years
ago,'' said Ted Jones, now its acting director. ``Looking back on
it, during that first year, if something had been that convenient,
I would have patronized it.''
   Most of the residents have been sober ``for only about six weeks
when they get here. And like I said, that first year of sobriety is
a volatile one,'' Jones said.
   The ABC board said that by the time it learned the Phoenix House
was so close to the store site it was too late because a 10-year
lease had been signed for the store.
   ``Had the board known about this previously, they never would
have approved the location,'' said Lucricia Foster, the ABC's
alcohol awareness coordinator. ``But now we're entered into a legal
contract with the builder, and we can't break it.''
   She said an ABC employee scouted the location when it was being
considered.
   ``In this instance, he was just not aware that the halfway house
was there. I know there are some signs marking it, but apparently
they weren't very noticeable,'' Miss Foster said.
   ``That sounds like some of the excuses we come up with for
drinking,'' said Alice McLean Stewart, chairwoman of the Phoenix
House board. ``It's raining, so I'm drinking, that kind of thing.

   More than 100 people applied for the

   The Huntington Cabell Wayne Animal Shelter advertised for three
days last month for someone who is in good health and has a high
school diploma and driver's license. One hundred-twelve people
applied.
   ``I think the number of responses we got is a clear indication

Thomas, said Thursday. ``I just wish I had 112 available jobs to
offer these people.''
   She said she hopes to fil the job next week.

   A young moose that had fallen through ice on
the Androscoggin River was destroyed Friday after a community
effort to save it failed.
   Volunteers and game wardens used blankets overnight in an effort
to keep the animal warm ``but she had suffered enough and couldn't
even lift her head. So I made the decision to destroy it,'' said
Fish and Game Warden Martin Garabedian.
   When an animal gets in trouble, Garabedian said, ``we usually
let nature take its course, but there were so many people who
wanted to help that we gave it a shot,'' adding that about 30
volunteers in the community of 300 people brought blankets.
   Garabedian on Thursday supervised the rescue of the 2-year-old,
600-pound moose.
   Garabedian said he looped a noose around the moose, and ``it
took seven or eight of us to pull her out.''

<TEXT>
   Enhanced images of a 150 million-year-old,
fist-sized dinosaur egg did not establish whether there's an embryo
inside.
   Columbia Scientific Inc., a Maryland software company, enhanced
CAT-scan images of the egg, and the high-tech pictures revealed a
small piece of shell inside the egg, in addition to a polliwog-like
image of a possible embryo, said Brent Harker, a spokesman for
Brigham Young University.
   ``The polliwog image looks very lifelike, much more so than on
the unenhanced film,'' Harker said.
   But it would require cracking the egg to be sure, and that
``would destroy it. We're not going to do that,'' he said.
   The egg will soon be displayed at the university's Earth
Sciences Museum.
   Paleontologist Wade Miller announced last week the egg may
contain the oldest dinosaur embryo ever found, dating from the
Jurassic period, which ended about 145 million years ago. The egg
was unearthed last summer from a quarry in Utah.
   ``I think the chances are good we have an embryo inside,''
Miller said Wednesday, after studying the enhanced images.

<HEAD>Humphrey Claims U.S. Aid To Afghan Rebels Is Dropping Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey claimed Friday that there
has been a sharp decline in the movement of U.S. aid to the
Afghanistan resistance fighters battling Soviet troops.
   The New Hampshire Republican, one of Capitol Hill's strongest
supporters of the Afghan rebels, told a news conference: ``I want
to know if this is negligence or a sell-out of the Afghan
resistance.''
   Last week, a top State Department official denied a similar
charge by members of the Afghan resistance.
   ``We will not abandon the Afghan resistance,'' said Robert Peck,
deputy assistanct secretary of state. He said U.S. support would go
ahead ``until that support is no longer needed.''
   Humphrey spoke a day after Afghanistan and Pakistan, which
represents the guerrillas, agreed on the main elements of a
U.N.-mediated peace accord that includes provisions for the
withdrawal of some 115,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan within
nine months.
   That agreement ``makes it all the more imperative that we get
some airlifts under way,'' Humphrey said.
   Humphrey said one of his staff members, Michael Pillsbury, spent
four days in Peshawar last week talking to Afghan resistance
leaders and came back with the conclusions that ``the flow of
weapons has decreased markedly and suddenly.''
   Humphrey said Pillsbury ``was shown warehouses which he and I
had visited a year ago, which were bulging then, but which are all
but empty now.''
   The United States provides weapons such as Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles to the guerrillas, but the amount of military aid is
classified. However, government sources have said Congress
increased the level to $630 million this year.
   Rep. William H. Gray, D-Pa., asked the congressional General
Accounting Office last month to investigate reports that more than
$1 billion in covert CIA aid to the Afghan rebels has been diverted
to corrupt Pakistani officials or to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
congressional sources told The Associated Press.
   However, the GAO said it had no authority to subpoena material
from the CIA.

   Contra rebels kidnapped 13 people in
northern Nicaragua, including an American volunteer for the Witness
for Peace organization, its local director said today.
   Edward Griffin, the local director for the organization,
identified the kidnapped American as Richard Boren, 29, of Elkin,
N.C.
   Organization officials said Boren was a Witness for Peace
volunteer in the Jinotega province of Nicaragua and had been
documenting Contra activities, including human rights abuses.
   Witness for Peace opposes the Contras and the Reagan
administration's policies in Central America.
   Griffin said Boren was abducted Tuesday in the Mancotal area of
Jinotega province, about 120 miles north of Managua. It is a zone
where the rebels operate regularly in their six-year fight against
the Sandinista government.
   A Defense Ministry communique said two Contras and four
defenders of the resettlement village were killed in the attack. It
said the Contras' leader, identified only as Wilmer, was one of the
dead rebels.
   In Washington, Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros denied that the
group had been kidnapped, saying they were ``detained'' by rebel
forces who suspected them of being foreign military collaborators
with the Sandinistas.
   Matamoros said the 13 will be released as soon as a
``trustworthy'' Nicaraguan can be found to return them to a safe
location.
   Generally, kidnapped civilians are held for a few days by the
Contras and then released.
   Matamoros accused the Sandinista government of sending
foreigners, especially Americans, to war zones. ``Its purpose is to
put them into a dangerous situation,'' he said.
   Witness for Peace said Boren had been in Nicaragua since
November ``documenting Contra human rights abuses and leading
delegations to areas of conflict.''
   The group's statement said Boren was a self-employed
construction worker and had worked for three years with the Peace
Corps in Ecuador before coming to Nicaragua.
   Last October, another Witness for Peace volunteer, Paul Fisher,
was kidnapped and held for 14 days by the Contras.
   In Washington, Witness for Peace said it had contacted the U.S.
State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Managua. The State
Department had no immediate confirmation.
   Dennis Marker, the organization's Washington director, said two
Witness for Peace volunteers in Jinotega were going today into the
area where Boren was taken to get more details on the incident.
   Marker said Witness for Peace has no connection with the
Nicaraguan government and documents abuses by the Sandinistas and
Contras, although ``our experience in the last four years is that
the large majority of abuses are Contra abuses.''
   He said Witness for Peace has 32 full-time volunteers in
Nicaragua. The group also sponsors tours to rural Nicaragua every
two weeks for Americans interested in the Contra issue.

   President Reagan plans to nominate Donna F.
Tuttle as deputy secretary of commerce, succeeding Clarence J.
Brown, the White House said Friday.
   Mrs. Tuttle, 40, has been undersecretary for travel and tourism
since 1983. Before that she was active in a number of Republican
political campaigns in California.
   The president also plans to nominate W. Allen Moore as
undersecretary of commerce for international trade administration,
succeeding S. Bruce Smart, the White House said.
   Moore, 43, has been chief of staff of the Senate Commerce
Committee since 1985 and before that was director of legislation
for Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   In addition, the White House said, the president will nominate
Jan. W. Mares to be assistant secretary of commerce for import
administration, succeeding Paul Freedenberg.
   Mares, 51, has been senior policy analyst for the White House
Office of Policy Development since 1985 and before that was
assistant secretary of energy for international affairs and for
policy.
   The White House also said Reagan will nominate Edward R.
Hamberger, 37, a Washington lawyer, as assistant secretary of
transportation for governmental affairs. He succeeds Rebecca Range,
now director of the White House Office of Public Liaison.
   Gordon A. Smith, 53, will be nominated as assistant secretary of
defense for command, control, communications and intelligence,
succeeding Donald C. Latham. Smith has been deputy director of the
Strategic Defense Initiative Organization at the Pentagon since
1986.

   The Madison Square Garden audience Thursday
night forgot the Elephant Man's bones, plastic surgery and other
controversies and sat, mesmerized by Michael Jackson the performer.
   His high voice, with its controlled vibrato, was enthralling,
especially on ``She's Out of My Life,'' which followed a duet of
``I Just Can't Stop (Loving You).'' Video screens amplified
Jackson's stricken expression as the duet ended, with the female
singer walking away.
   The girlish face of Jackson, 29, often was shown large on the
screens that flanked the stage. But he made no attempt to maintain
a ``pretty'' expression, adopting a tearful, grieving pose several
times at the end of songs.
   Unlike his 1984 tour, in which Jackson was by far the most
graceful, dancing in a line with his brothers, this time he was
among equals, surrounded most of the time by four men obviously
well trained in dance.
   Jackson's kicks and spins were so fast the eye only registered
them after they were over. His pelvic thrusts, like different
jackets he donned, conveyed little sexual suggestion and much
childlike ``dressing up'' like grownups.
   The stagecraft looked simple but probably was far from it. There
were no giant structures, just the smooth front half of the stage
where Jackson sang and danced and a lower-level back of the stage
for four backup singers, seven musicians and modern music's mounds
of equipment.
   Much use was made of spotlights, sometimes on four sides of the
singer, each filled with his silhouette, and laser beams stabbed
the air. Once, Jackson ended a song and a circle of green lights
surrounded his feet.
   There were tricks, in which he seemed magically to move from one
place to another, as in 1984. In one, Jackson he stood on a ladder
and a cylinder drape dropped over him from above. His next
appearance was on the other side of the stage, where a
``gangplank'' lifted up and swung him out over the audience.
   Near the beginning of the evening, a man walked out on stage,
shook hands with Jackson and began to dance opposite him. Briefly,
it seemed part of the show, then a couple of large bodyguards
walked the intruder offstage, fairly unobtrusively. No abrupt moves
were made and the show's pacing wasn't dented.
   Spontaneity was in short supply but the well-planned
entertainment being offered was so fascinating that a viewer didn't
mind.
   Jackson's dancing and just trotting around stage is grace
itself. A couple times he did a robot sequence, but obviously is
playing down his ``signatures'' of one jeweled glove and the moon
walk. He used both only once, during ``Billie Jean.''
   Jackson's solo tour began in September in Japan. In America it
began Feb. 23 in Kansas City, Mo., and will run till mid-May. This
first of three shows at Madison Square Garden was a benefit for the
United Negro College Fund, to whose president Jackson presented a
check for $600,000 on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Israel Blocks Journalists From Major Troublespots</HEAD>

   Israel blocked journalists from major trouble
spots in the occupied territories Friday in an effort to limit news
reports of explosive Palestinian protests following weekly Moslem
prayers.
   The media clampdown came after complaints from politicians,
soldiers and settlers that the presence of journalists often
inflamed Arab protests in the West Bank and Gaza and caused more
violence.
   Despite the absence of cameras and notepads, Palestinian revolts
occurred Friday in most of the West Bank's major cities.
   Friday also marked the first time since the start of Arab unrest
on Dec. 8 that Israeli soldiers had blocked major roads and turned
back journalists from cities and refugee camps that typically are
the sites of post-prayer protests.
   Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid, the army's spokesman in Tel Aviv, told
The Associated Press the barricades did not represent an official
change in military policy.
   ``There are a few localities that are closed according to
existing policy which allows local commanders to shut an area based
on operational needs,'' Lapid said.
   The army declined to say how many cities and refugee camps were
off-limits to journalists. But in the West Bank, soldiers barred
reporters from more than half a dozen major cities. Only Bethlehem,
the traditional birthplace of Jesus, was open.
   ``This is a closed military area,'' one soldier told an AP
photographer outside Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem. ``If you
don't leave now, we will arrest you.''
   An army jeep then followed the photographer's car for about
three miles, apparently to make sure it was headed toward Jerusalem.
   Journalists were permitted to enter the Gaza Strip, but kept
from the area around Gaza City's main mosque and the major
commercial street.
   The decision to bar journalists from the occupied territories
drew mixed reviews from Israelis.
   ``The right to see bang-bang is not protected by the First
Amendment,'' said Zeev Chafets, a former director of the Government
Press Office and a native of Pontiac, Mich.
   ``I would support closing off the West Bank to the world press
in a minute, but keeping it open to the Israeli press,'' Chafets
said in an interview. ``The world press is only an asterisk here.
To me, what's important is my press.''
   But Israel Peleg, also a former director of the Government Press
Office, disagreed.
   ``It is better to let the media operate freely and without any
obstacles than to be depicted in the world as a country that
restricts journalists,'' Peleg told The AP.
   ``Israel's image may be immediately harmed by these pictures (of
protests), but in the long run, the fact that these pictures can be
circulated speaks for Israel's democracy,'' he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc twice
this week publicly referred to the possibility of restricting media
access and accused journalists of bias against Israel.
   Some soldiers serving in the West Bank also have said
journalists make their jobs more difficult. Angry settlers in
Hebron attacked foreign photographers Thursday, accusing them of
impeding troops' efforts to arrest an Arab who stabbed a
15-year-old settler.
   Four soldiers were arrested after a CBS News crew photographed
them beating Palestinians with rocks last week.
   But Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of the left-leaning Labor
Party has warned that barring media access to the occupied
territories will simply spark rumors of atrocities that journalists
will be unable to refute from on-the-scene reporting.
   Other Israeli officials have warned that denying media access
could lead to unfavorable comparisons between Israel and South
Africa, which the government has been sensitive about.
   In South Africa, police can declare areas off-limits to
journalists on the spot and demand that all reporters leave. In
Israel, local commanders also are permitted to declare an area
closed if they deem the presence of journalists will make the
army's job more difficult.
   In addition to limiting access, Israel has military censors who,
in an effort to prevent what they consider to be incitement,
carefully control Arabic-language newspapers based in Jerusalem
which circulate in the occupied territories.
   But the censorship controls on foreign press coverage of the
occupied territories have been less stringent.
   Robert Slater, chairman of the Foreign Press Association, said
he was ``appalled but not surprised'' by Israel's decision to bar
journalists from large portions of the territories Friday.
   ``From the prime minister's statements and comments by Cabinet
members, it appeared increasingly likely the government would do
something to keep us away from this story,'' Slater said in an
interview. ``We have fought it for three months, and we will
continue to fight it.''

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Americans View Ties with Europe as Important</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The vast majority of Americans view ties with
Europe as very important for the United States, but at the same
time they recognize that trans-Atlantic links have waned over the
past 10 years, a poll commissioned by the European Economic
Community shows.
   The Gallup Poll of ``national opinion leaders'' and the general
public, published in the March edition of the EEC magazine,
``Europe,'' also shows the majority of respondents believe U.S.
troops must be stationed in Europe to prevent a Soviet attack.
   Of those polled, 86 percent said U.S. ties with Europe ``matter
a great deal,'' compared with 65 percent who answered the same way
in a 1973 poll commissioned by the magazine.
   Asked how today's ties compare with those of 10 years ago, 33
percent of the respondents said they were closer, but 53 percent
said they were ``not as close.''
   The United States should strengthen its links with Europe,
according to 53 percent of those polled. Thirty-one percent favor
the level of current ties and 11 percent support reduced ties with
the continent.
   Although about one-third of the respondents said West European
countries engage in unfair trading practices, both the general
public and national opinion leaders _ which the magazine defined as
business and academic leaders and policy makers _ cited Japan as an
unfair trading partner more than twice as often as the countries of
Western Europe.
   For example, 30 percent of the public said they view Europe as
an unfair partner, while 65 percent cited Japan.
   Respondents are more likely to know about the U.S. trade deficit
with Japan than about the one with Western Europe, according to the
poll. The 1987 deficit with Japan was $59.8 billion _ the largest
chunk of the $171.2 billion overall deficit _ while the deficit
with Europe was $30.2 billion.
   Of those polled, 47 percent said they ``mostly agree'' that
Europe is a good market for the United States, while 31 percent
said they ``completely agree.''
   Those polled generally said they respect European achievements
in arts, but gave higher credit to U.S. achievements in science,
encouragement of individual creativity and equal opportunity.
   Among the general public, 54 percent said the United States
provides an excellent education for its citizens, while 21 percent
said Europe has a good educational system. But among the opinion
leaders, 33 percent said the United States provides an excellent
education and 34 percent credited Europe with the same service.
   The poll, conducted late last year by telephone, surveyed 1,300
adult Americans and 387 opinion leaders. The poll results had a 3
percentage point margin of error.

<HEAD>Jury Acquits Davis In Shootings Of Four Suspected Drug Dealers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man arrested after a 17-day manhunt was
acquitted in the execution-style murders of four suspected drug
dealers but was returned to jail to await trial next month on
charges of attempted murder of police officers.
   The jury returned its verdict against Larry Davis, 21, on
Thursday night after nine days of deliberations.
   Davis' attorneys, including William M. Kunstler, argued that he
was framed and police tried to kill him because he knew about
police corruption involving drugs in the South Bronx.
   Besides the trial stemming from the shootout with 27 police
officers, Davis also faces separate trials for two other murders.
   The Nov. 19, 1986 shoot-out, in which six police officers were
wounded but Davis escaped unharmed from a Bronx apartment, set off
the manhunt. Police said they had gone to the apartment to question
Davis about the deaths of the alleged drug dealers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Winter Olympics won the February rating
sweeps for ABC, putting it into second place for the season and
breaking NBC's 11-sweeps win streak.
   Based on A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the 28-day sweeps period,
ABC won with an average prime-time rating of 17.3 and a 27 share,
thanks to the average 19.3 rating for the Olympics, which dominated
59 percent of prime time.
   NBC, which won each of the 12 nights that didn't include
Olympics coverage, came in second with a 15.9 and 25. CBS was third
with 13.8 and 21.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   Unless CBS beats ABC by 1.5 rating points each week for the
remaining seven weeks of the television season, it will end the
season in third place for the first time ever.
   February is one of four sweeps months each year when rating
companies measure local station audiences for use in negotiating
advertising rates. To help affiliates, the networks load their
schedules with special programming.
   NBC and CBS insist the February sweeps will have less impact on
local advertising rates than other sweeps, because stations can
refuse to negotiate based on ratings for the unusual Olympics
programming.
   Nevertheless, the win was a boost for ABC, which hasn't won a
sweeps since 1984. The games were also a boost for the networks in
general, since the three-network share of the viewing audience rose
to 75 percent from 71 percent.
   The Olympics also apparently helped ABC's ``World News Tonight''
take the top spot in the network evening news race for three weeks.
But the games didn't help ``Good Morning America'' out of the No. 2
position it has occupied behind NBC's ``Today'' show for 15 weeks
in a row.
   Of the four miniseries that aired during the month, ``Elvis and
Me'' on ABC was the highest-rated, with a 24.4. ``Windmills of the
Gods'' on CBS was second with an 18.2 and CBS' ``Bluegrass'' was
third with 18.0. NBC's ``Noble House'' was last with a 16.3. All
were two-part, four-hour miniseries, except ``Noble House,'' which
aired eight hours over four nights.
   The top-rated specials of the months, not counting the Olympics,
were: ``Super Bloopers'' on NBC with a rating of 21.3; the special
prime-time ``Late Night with David Letterman'' on NBC, with a
rating of 19.3; the premiere of the new NBC series ``Day by Day''
with 18.6; the ``Miss USA'' pageant on CBS with a 16.2; and ``The
Wizard of Oz'' on CBS with a 15.3.
   The top-rated movies of the sweeps were: ``Hostage'' on CBS with
a 19.4; ``Perry Mason'' on NBC with 17.4; ``Moving Target'' on NBC
with 17.2; ``Police Academy II'' on NBC with 16.7; and ``Return of
Desperado'' on NBC with 16.0.

<HEAD>Tibetan Leader Confirms Monk Died In Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high-ranking Tibetan official confirmed Friday
that a Buddhist monk jailed for advocating Tibetan independence had
died in prison, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Xinhua said Gyamco, vice-chairman of the Tibetan Autonomous
Region government, told foreign reporters in Tibet that Lobsang
Wangchuk died last year of lung cancer while serving an 18-year
term.
   Tibetan exile groups in India said last year that Wangchuk died
Nov. 4 of injuries suffered in a beating after he refused to admit
he was wrong to support Tibetan independence. He was 74.
   At the time, Chinese authorities in Beijing dismissed the report
of Wangchuk's death as ``sheer fabrication.''
   Xinhua's report did not say why authorities initially denied the
report. However, his death came during a time of great tension in
the remote Himalayan region. One month earlier, three anti-Chinese
demonstrations were led by Buddhist monks and at least 14 people
were killed.
   ``In the People's Republic of China citizens can freely air
their views,'' the report quoted Gyamco as saying. ``But advocating
independence for any part of the nation is a crime.''
   Wangchuk was first arrested in 1959, nine years after Chinese
troops entered Tibet, for taking part in an uprising against
Chinese rule. Tibet's god-king, the Dalai Lama, fled to India
during that uprising.
   According to exiled Tibetan groups, Wangchuk was detained
without trial until 1962, when he was sentenced to a 10-year term.
He was released at the end of his term but was arrested again in
1981.
   Xinhua said Wangchuk ``renewed his splittist activities by
distributing leaflets advocating the independence of Tibet'' and
was sentenced to three years in jail. The term was extended to 18
years because he refused to change his views, the report said.
   Splittist is a term coined by the Chinese to refer to
individuals who advocate independence for regions in China.
   Xinhua also quoted Gyamco as saying last year's protests ``had
no impact at all'' on China's policy of allowing religious freedom
in Tibet.
   ``On the contrary, it (the policy) will be more effectively
implemented,'' it quoted him as saying.
   Tibetans traditionally are deeply religious, and before the
Chinese Red Army entered in 1950 were governed by a theocracy
headed by the Dalai Lama and the Buddhist monasteries.
   The Chinese smashed the temporal power of the monasteries and
for many years banned public worship. Thousands of monasteries were
destroyed and their monks forced to marry during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution.
   Since then, public worship has been restored and some
monasteries have been rebuilt. However, most monks and many lay
Tibetans remain hostile to Chinese rule.
   An eight-day Great Prayer Festival that ended this week in
Lhasa, Tibet's capital, was boycotted by many monks because of the
heavy Chinese police presence. Attendance by pilgrims also was
sharply down, according to Tibetan sources and Westerners who
observed the festival this year and in the past.

<HEAD>Florida Army National Guard Heading To Panama For Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six hundred Florida National Guard
troops will go to Panama for a two-week ``Total Warrior'' training
exercise despite riots and a general strike there, officials
announced.
   ``The political turmoil has no effect on the training there,''
Florida Guard spokesman Maj. Ken Forrester said Thursday. ``This
has been scheduled a year in advance, and we see no reason to
change it.''
   U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Bernard Loeffke in Panama sent assurances
Wednesday that troops training in the Canal Zone would be safe,
said Forrester from Guard headquarters in St. Augustine.
   ``And with 10,000 regular Army troops down there, I can't see us
doing anything but the training we have scheduled,'' said Forrester.
   Troops from the 3rd Battalion, 124th Infantry based in Panama
City, Fla., won't be allowed off U.S. bases during the jungle
training, he said.
   ``There's been some concern, but I haven't had any hysterical
moms saying their son or husband isn't going,'' Lt. Charles Boss
said.
   During Total Warrior _ 12 days of mock raids and ambushes _
troops would have little time for sightseeing, he said.
   ``We're going to fly into Howard Air Force Base and go directly
into the jungle,'' Boss said. ``After 12 days ... they'll only be
interested in a shower, a cold beer and getting back to sleep.''
   Two Florida Guard battalions have trained in Panama for each of
the last three years, Forrester said.
   The battalion troops are to leave Tyndall Air Force Base near
this Gulf Coast resort area March 12 and return March 27.
   The unit will be the first U.S. troops sent to Panama for
training since then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle's failed Feb. 25
effort to oust strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega. Panama's de facto
leader was indicted last month by Tampa and Miami federal grand
juries which accused Noriega of involvement with drug dealing.

   The Commerce Department celebrated its 75th
anniversary Friday as Commerce Secretary C. William Verity cut a
10-foot-by-6-foot cake and President Reagan issued a special
proclamation.
   ``This moment is an historic snapshot in time of the development
of our government which goes back over 200 years,'' Verity said at
a celebration attended by an estimated 1,600 agency employees.
   Reagan issued a proclamation declaring Friday as Department of
Commerce Day.
   ``The employees of the Department of Commerce have always
reflected the finest traditions of public service. That was surely
true of the department's late secretary, Malcolm Baldrige, and our
present secretary, C. William Verity Jr,'' Reagan said in the
proclamation.
   Verity, who became commerce secretary in 1987 after the death of
Baldrige in a freak horse-riding accident, was joined by one of his
secretaries, Willa Petty, in leading the audience in a rendition of
``Happy Birthday'' before cutting the cake, a replica of the
Commerce Department headquarters.
   Ms. Petty was a stand-in for singer Pearl Bailey, who had been
scheduled to preside over the proceedings but who canceled at the
last minute.

   Six men have been indicted on 23 felony counts of
fraud and conspiracy, alleging they stole timber worth ``hundreds
of thousands of dollars'' from the Olympic National Forest.
   Among those indicted late Thursday are the former owner and crew
chief of one of the most powerful independent logging operations on
the Olympic Peninsula, Glenn T. Anderson Inc.
   After a four-year investigation, the government accused the six
of stealing Forest Service timber from the national forest,
conspiracy to steal, filing false statements and conflict of
interest.
   Federal court documents filed last October allege the thefts to
be in the range of ``hundreds of thousands of dollars.''
   Court files accuse five of the men of devising scams to cheat
the Forest Service of revenue on logs harvested off public land.
The alleged scams included forging log brands, sawing up unscaled
logs, and recycling log-truck load identifier tickets, the
documents say.
   The documents also say one defendant, Gregory B. Maurer, 43, of
Aberdeen, former U.S. Forest Service timber sale administrator on
the Olympic Forest's Quinault Ranger District, allegedly looked the
other way to allow the scams.
   The indictment also says Maurer ran a secret forest cleanup
company that catered to the logging operators he was supposed to
regulate as timber sale administrator.
   The charges carry maximum penalties of up to 10 years in prison
and fines of up to $250,000.

<HEAD>Police Called to Quell Second Commuter Revolt This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police were summoned to quell a revolt by angry
commuters who vandalized and jammed the doors of a delayed subway
train, and refused to get off in protest, authorities said Friday.
   It was the second such mutiny in the Underground this week.
   ``We got the message the first time. This is only making things
worse,'' said David Morris, a spokesman for London Regional
Transport, which operates the massive system.
   The spectacle of rebellion by London's usually reserved and
mild-mannered commuters is making headline news in the capital, and
a member of Parliament says he will raise the issue in the House of
Commons.
   Morris said the latest incident was ``pretty close to an
out-of-control act of vandalism,'' while one of the passengers
involved said commuters had grown fed up with delays and shoddy
stations.
   The first whiff of trouble came Tuesday night when, in what
London Regional Transport called unprecedented behavior, passengers
at Finchley Central station on the Northern Line refused a request
to get off the train prematurely and forced the driver to take them
to their destination.
   The second incident occurred at the same station. In both cases,
the trains had been delayed by track defects and passengers were
told to get off and catch the next train.
   The first incident ended in peaceful victory for the commuters
without police intervention. The second incident, by all accounts,
was nastier.
   ``Passengers ripped off pieces of the train and used them to jam
the doors,'' said Morris. ``Apparently there was much jubilation.
Undoubtedly it was inspired by what happened on Tuesday. The staff
called the Transport Police who ordered the passengers off the
train, and they obeyed.''
   London's Evening Standard newspaper quoted passenger Faz Razeen,
34, a leader of the revolt, as saying: ``People were really worked
up and annoyed.'' Some had waited more than half an hour for their
train, he said.
   Morris conceded that half-hour waits were not unusual. ``We are
trying to do something. But if people don't use their common sense
the whole line will come to a stop. Whatever sympathy they got over
the first incident will soon be lost.''
   Morris insisted that in both incidents, the passengers behaved
selfishly because by trying to force their trains to take them to
their destinations, they made passengers at other stations wait
longer.
   But the Standard said this response ``betrays an arrogance which
ought to be replaced at once by better management on the Misery
Line.''
   John Marshall, a Conservative Party lawmaker and Northern Line
commuter, said the Northern Line ``is the nearest thing to hell on
Earth,'' and promised to raise the matter in Parliament.
   Replied Morris: ``When you're running 460 trains a day for 2.5
million passengers, something always goes wrong.'' He said
Thursday's delays were caused by a beer can that was thrown onto
the line, jamming a track mechanism.
   Meanwhile, the Standard tracked down the man said to have
started Tuesday night's rebellion by quietly declaring his refusal
to get off the train.
   Described by fellow-passengers as a mild-mannered, well-dressed
man, he turned out to be 49-year-old civil servant Barry Blain.
   ``I am not a natural rebel,'' the Standard quoted him as saying,
``but like a lot of my fellow commuters I am fed up with our
treatment on the Northern Line.''

<HEAD>Tass Says 31 Killed in Azerbaijan Rioting</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines previous and adds background. RESTORES byline.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Thirty-one people were killed in ethnic rioting in
the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait, the state-run news agency Tass
reported today.
   It was the first time the official media reported deaths in
ethnic violence between Azeris and Armenians in the two southern
Soviet republics. Dissident sources had reported that as many as 20
people died in the Sumgait riots.
   The rioting erupted Sunday in the industrial city 19 miles
northwest of the Azerbaijani capital of Baku. Government spokesmen
had previously acknowledged people were killed in the rioting, but
refused to say how many. A television worker in Baku had said one
or two people were killed.
   The Tass dispatch blamed the Sunday killings on ``hooligan
elements provoked by disorder.''
   Trouble between the Azeris, who are predominantly Shiite
Moslems, and Armenians, who are Christian, began early last month
with a dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan just
north of Iran and east of Turkey. More than three-quarters of the
population is Armenian, but it was made part of Azerbaijan in 1923.
   Armenians are demanding that the region be made part of the
republic of Armenia. Azeris opposed the move and violence has
ensued.
   Earlier today, an Armenian nationalist said his sister and at
least two other people were killed in ethnic violence in Armenia.
   ``Unstable, immature people, falling under the influence of
false rumors about the events in Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia,
involved themselves in lawsless actions,'' Tass said. ``Criminal
elements took part in violent activities and looting. From their
hands, 31 people perished.''
   An English version of the Tass story said the dead included
``members of various nationalities, old men and women.''
   On Thursday Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet
Foreign Ministry in Moscow, gave the first official confirmation of
deaths during the riots in Azerbaijan, but would not say how many
people were killed.
   On Tuesday, he said he could not confirm reports from Armenian
activists that up to 20 people were killed in Sumgait, in
Azerbaijan. But he added, ``There was hooliganism, and there can be
deaths in such cases.''
   The first official hint of deaths in the ethnic unrest came Feb.
24, when non-voting Politburo member Vladimir I. Dolgikh said on
Armenian television that ``in Nagorno-Karabakh, the matter has gone
so far as confrontations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, and
there have been casualties.''
   Street rallies began Feb. 13 in Nagorno-Karabakh and later
spread to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, where dissidents said
more than 1 million people demonstrated. On Feb. 19 rioting spread
to Sumgait.
   Mosef Gorgisyan telephoned The Associated Press in Moscow to say
his sister, Avetik Gorgisyan, 32, was stabbed today and two other
people were shot in their homes in the Armenian city of Kirovakan.
He said the three were killed by Azeris.
   He said six people, all ethnic Azeris, were arrested in the
killings.
   Gerasimov said he could neither confirm nor deny the report
because he had no information about renewed violence in the region.
   Gorgisyan, 26, is a member of an unsanctioned Armenian
organization called the Alliance for National Self-Determination.
   Gorgisyan said his sister was killed today, but the telephone
was cut off before he could say when the two shootings reportedly
occurred. He said demonstrations had been held in Kirovakan earlier.
   He said he saw the aftermath of three slayings in Kirovakan. He
said he had heard 13 other people were killed but could not confirm
those reports.
   Gorgisyan said his grandmother and other relatives were in his
sister's house when the stabbing occurred.
   An official at the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Yerevan said,
``There were no deaths anywhere in the republic.'' The ministry
includes the police forces of the region. The official refused to
give his name.
   An official answering the telephone at police headquarters in
Kirovakan refused comment. ``I am not obligated to say anything to
foreigners about what happens here,'' said the official, who
declined to give his name.
   Kirovakan is a city of 137,000 people about 35 miles north of
the Armenian capital of Yerevan. Western reporters have not been
allowed to travel to the region.
   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev became Communist Party chief, the
most deaths previously reported in ethnic unrest occurred in Alma
Ata, the capital of the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   Up to 3,000 people rioted in that city Dec. 17-18, 1986, to
protest the appointment of a Russian to replace an ethnic Kazakh as
local party chief. Soviet media reported that two people were
killed, 200 injured and dozens arrested.

   A settlement aimed at ending the war in
Afghanistan appeared to be taking shape Friday, and the latest
round of peace talks were recessed while Pakistan decided if it was
willing to deal with the Soviet-backed Afghan government.
   Still open, too, was the question of whether Afghanistan's
Moslem resistance groups would drop their fierce opposition to
future power-sharing with Afghan President Najib.
   After a short session of the U.N.-sponsored talks Friday,
Pakistan's chief negotiator, acting Foreign Minister Zain Noorani,
flew back to Islamabad for a rare meeting between the government
and leaders of the political opposition.
   Pakistan represents the Afghan guerrillas in the negotiations.
   The meeting in Pakistan was convened by Prime Minister Mohammad
Khan Junejo to try to reach a consensus on whether a settlement
should be signed with Najib's government.
   It was the first time the government sought such direct contact
with the opposition since President Mohammad Zia-Ul Haq seized
power in a 1977 coup.
   Before leaving, Noorani reaffirmed Pakistan's position that a
settlement must include formation of a transitional government
replacing Najib's.
   Pakistan does not recognize Najib's government and has said it
must be replaced if 5 million Afghan refugees living in Pakistan
and Iran are to return safely home.
   Most of Pakistan's opposition parties have urged the government
to sign an accord clearing the way for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan, then worry about a political settlement
later.
   Diego Cordovez, the U.N. mediator who has been the go-between in
the nearly 6-year-old talks, told reporters that Thursday's
agreement on a nine-month timetable for the withdrawal of the
Soviet troops represented a ``significant step'' toward a final
political settlement.
   He stopped short of saying it was complete but exuded confidence
that remaining issues would be resolved, noting that all sides
showed ``determination and political will.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said that if an accord is
signed by March 15, the estimated 115,000 Red Army troops would
begin leaving Afghanistan in mid-May. The Soviets intervened in
1979.
   Afghanistan has accused Pakistan of ``undermining'' peace
prospects by linking the withdrawal to formation of a transitional
government.
   The head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil,
told a U.N. Human Rights Commission on Friday that his nation's
concept of a multiparty government of ``national reconciliation''
has the ``vigorous support of our people.''
   Opponents say that concept is designed to cement the leading
role of Najib's governing People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   Wakil said ``political hysteria'' made the opposition reject all
attempts by Kabul to launch a ``constructive dialogue.'' Instead,
he said, ``extremist bands'' relying on mounting supplies of
American and British arms had stepped up their ``destructive and
terrorist deeds.''
   The United States has been largely non-committal on the issue
and some sources close to the talks said there is a growing feeling
in Pakistan that Washington's prime interest is in sealing a deal
before the Moscow summit.
   Cordovez indicated Friday he is increasingly confident that
there will be an eventual compromise on the future shape of the
Kabul government.
   He said he was in ``close contact'' with superpower
representatives on the problem and was confident the Afghan
resistance will ``change its attitude once a settlement is signed.''

<HEAD>Opposition Plans New Action Following Ershad Win in Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's
Jatiya Party gained a lopsided majority in Parliament in an
election that brought new calls for protests Friday from opposition
leaders.
   An opposition coalition of 21 parties scheduled rallies for a
``day of protest'' Saturday and denounced Thursday's balloting,
which they boycotted.
   At least 13 people were reported killed and more than 300 were
injured in election violence, and reporters who visited polling
places found evidence of a low voter turnout and widespread vote
rigging.
   With results announced Friday for 218 of the 299 Parliament
seats up for grabs, the president's party had won 194.
   A coalition of 73 small factions known as the Combined
Opposition Parties won 12, two other small parties had one each,
and independents won seven. Voting was canceled in one district
where a candidate was slain. The other 30 seats in the 330-seat
Parliament are reserved for women, who will be chosen later.
   In the 1986 elections, Jatiya won 157 seats, but its majority
rose to 210 after wheeling and dealing with independents and the
addition of the 30 seats for women. Those traditionally go to the
governing party.
   The vote did not end the stalemate between Ershad and his
leading opponents, Sheik Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia
of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
   The women vowed to persist in their campaign against Ershad, and
Ms. Hasina declared, ``We will topple this corrupt government.''
They have been organizing anti-Ershad demonstrations and strikes
since Nov. 10.
   Bangladesh journalists decided to stop work for a night to
protest government restrictions on the press that were imposed
under a national state of emergency in November.
   Reazuddin Ahmed, president of the Bangladesh Federal Union of
Journalists representing about 1,500 journalists across the
country, said government officials had been phoning newspapers each
night and telling them not to publish news of anti-government
activities.
   He said they were told not to publish news of a low voter
turnout or election violence.
   Most newspapers seemed to have kept low profile about reporting
violence or election fraud.
   The action will result in non-publication of about 15
Dhaka-based dailies and half a dozen more outside Dhaka on
Saturday. Two national news agencies will also be affected.
   Ershad said he expected the new Parliament to serve out its full
five-year term.
   Ershad dissolved the Parliament last December, 3{ years early,
in a move to compromise with the opposition. The opposition
declared a boycott of the election.
   The former lieutenant took power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and
was elected president in 1986.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Amendment To Let White House Withhold Details From
Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate, trying to avoid another
Iran-Contra affair, on Friday voted down an effort to let the White
House withhold details about covert operations from Congress.
   The 65-23 vote came as the chamber worked on a bill which would
require that Congress be notified about all covert actions within
48 hours after they start.
   The vote killed an amendment proposed by Sen. James McClure,
R-Idaho, which would have allowed a president simply to tell
Congress that a covert action had started, but withhold details
until later.
   McClure called his proposal ``a compromise'' which he said
``gives the president some flexibility'' about when to tell
Congress.
   But Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, chief author of the bill, said
McClure's amendment ``is not a compromise; it's a capitulation. ...
This lets the president play `I've got a secret' but not tell.''
   The bill's future is unclear. The Reagan administration strongly
opposes the measure as an unconstitutional limit on a president's
ability to conduct foreign policy. A similar measure is pending in
the House, but has not yet reached the floor.
   Cohen is vice-chairman of the Intelligence Committee and was
also a member of the Iran-Contra committee which investigated the
sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion of some of the profits
to the Contra guerrillas. President Reagan withheld notice from
Congress for 10 months about the Iranian arms sales.
   The bill overhauls procedures for notifying Congress about
intelligence actions. The chief provision requires that
notification be sent to Capitol Hill within 48 hours of the time a
covert operation begins, replacing the current requirement that
Congress be given ``timely notification,'' which is not defined.
   Cohen said the bill ``cannot guarantee that future abuses such
as Iran-Contra will not occur, but it will certainly minimize
them.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, an opponent, called the bill ``an
overreaction to the Iran-Contra situation.'' He termed it
``unnecessary, unwise, and unconstitutional.''
   But Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said, ``the requirement for
this legislation has certainly been demonstrated.''
   ``There is no question but that not being advised for over 10
months (about the Iran arms sale) was not a timely notification,''
said Bentsen. ``What this legislation does is close that loophole.''
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the bill contained ``small, but
necessary steps,'' although he warned ``we can write every law
conceivable, but unless the people follow them, they are no good.''
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said, ``many people believe that if we
had this requirement in place, Iran-Contra would never have
happened, but that's not so.''
   Cohen agreed, noting that ``there's no piece of legislation we
can enact that would prevent a president from exercising poor
judgement.''

   Pat Robertson was accused in court papers
Friday of abusing the judicial process by trying to dismiss the $35
million libel suit he filed against an ex-congressman who
questioned his war record.
   Lawyers for former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif.,
formally opposed Robertson's motion to dismiss the case that is set
to go to trial next Tuesday, the campaign season's Super Tuesday
when the former television evangelist is hoping make a good showing
in Southern states.
   Robertson, though still denying McCloskey's allegations, says he
felt he had to abandon his libel suit because he couldn't take part
in the trial and effectively campaign at the same time.
   However, McCloskey's lawyers said in court papers Friday that
Robertson ``initiated this action for political purposes and has
conducted this litigation in bad faith, putting the defendant to
substantial, unnecessary and improper expense and public
denigration.''
   Robertson's ``last-minute tactics to avoid trial are just the
latest, most flagrant example of his abuse of the judicial process
and his attempt to treat this forum as a court of convenience,''
the lawyers said in papers filed with U.S. District Judge Joyce
Hens Green.
   The judge must now make a decision on Robertson's motion to
dismiss the lawsuit.
   The libel suit against McCloskey was filed in 1986 following
publication of McCloskey's charges that Robertson used the help of
his father, the late Sen. A. Willis Robertson, D-Va., to avoid
combat during the Korean War.
   The former television evangelist ``agonized over the decision to
seek dismissal'' but concluded that the trial date _ which the
judge refused to postpone _ presented ``a Hobson's choice of either
abandoning his campaign during a critical period or forgoing the
opportunity for personal vindication,'' Robertson's lawyers said
Thursday in their motion to dismiss the case.
   McCloskey's lawyers asked the judge to order the trial to
proceed to ensure ``the right of Mr. McCloskey to have the same
vindication of his integrity that Mr. Robertson apparently sought.''
   If the judge decides to dismiss the lawsuit, McCloskey's lawyers
asked that she order Robertson to pay the former congressman's
court costs and legal fees, which they estimated to be about
$400,000.
   They also asked the judge to preserve McCloskey's legal rights
to initiate court action against Robertson and his attorneys
involving ``possible claims'' of malicious prosecution.
   ``To allow plaintiff to initiate an action which may require the
expenditure of significant legal fees by or on behalf of Mr.
McCloskey in defending his First Amendment right of
self-expression, on the eve of the trial to both denounce the
defendant in the most outrageous fashion and then request that the
court dismiss the case seems to be the very sort of manipulation of
the judicial process which this court should resist,'' attorneys
George Lehner, Roger Spaeder and Leslie Blackmon said in their
brief.
   McCloskey's motion also asked the judge to issue an order
preventing ``future legal actions against Mr. McCloskey based on
any past or future repetition of the statements at issue in this
action.''
   While a dismissal of the case would prevent Robertson from suing
McCloskey over the statements he made in 1986, the former
congressman ``is concerned that Mr. Robertson may attempt to
silence his free speech again, with yet another lawsuit based on
repetitions of the alleged libels,'' the brief said.

   If Tammy and Michelle Walsh were stumped
by the Pythagorean theorem or baffled by Ohm's Law when they were
doing their school assignments, help was usually just a call away,
by ship's radio.
   While sailing in the Bahamas, an engineer from Nassau was there
with advice on algebra. A vacationing English professor from the
University of California at Berkeley once offered essay-writing
tips.
   The sisters now are freshmen at Babson College, having completed
elementary, junior high and high school while sailing on the
Atlantic with their parents and two cats on a 45-foot boat called
High Hopes.
   They studied French in Florida and geometry in Georgetown via a
Chicago correspondence school that once a year mailed books and
exams. They completed the tests at their own pace and returned them
for grading.
   ``I think we got a better education,'' Michelle, 21, who took
some time off before going to college, said in an interview at the
1,550-student undergraduate business school outside Boston. ``You
learned much more because you read everything. You had a lot of
responsibility. We ended up more well-rounded and ready to take on
the world.''
   In 1971, when the sisters were pre-schoolers, Mickey and Joyce
Walsh of Oakdale, N.Y., on Long Island's south shore, decided to
take the kids sailing. Mickey gave up his job working on a clam
dredge and the family left for Puerto Rico, where they lived for a
year.
   They returned to Puerto Rico in 1974 for another year, and
Michelle started in correspondence school. The family sold their
house in 1979 and decided to move to the boat.
   ``They always liked sailing and wanted to live on a boat and
travel,'' Tammy, 18, said of her parents. ``They were going to wait
until we grew up.''
   Instead, the family went to sea and the girls learned to
discipline themselves in their studies. Their parents left them on
their own almost from the start, they said.
   ``They felt we were mature and responsible enough to do it and
by doing that we became more mature and responsible,'' said Tammy.
   The Walshes spent summers on New York's Fire Island, then
usually left in October and sailed down the Atlantic Coast. The
trip offered maximum study time, often up to eight hours a day.
   ``Then we'd get to the beach and not (study) for months,''
Michelle said.
   The family spent most winters anchored off Georgetown in the
Exuma Islands in the Bahamas. Books often weren't a priority;
Michelle needed three years to complete algebra.
   Michelle and Tammy admit that while they disciplined themselves
enough to finish the required texts, if the sun was shining and the
water glistening, boardsailing won out over Shakespeare.
   ``We didn't have set hours,'' said Michelle. ``If it was a
beautiful day outside I wasn't going to sit and read.''
   Mary McKeown, principal of the Chicago-based American School of
Correspondence, said Michelle received her high school equivalency
diploma in 1984 and Tammy in 1987. They had to take at least 16
credits under Illinois requirements.
   She said the school is accredited by the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools and serves a variety of
students, from young people living abroad to adults seeking to
finish high school. Tuition and books cost $679 for four years.
   Science and math courses most frequently sent the sisters
searching for help on the radio or high seas.
   ``People living on boats are very friendly,'' Tammy said. ``You
don't think anything about rowing up to someone's boat, knocking on
the hull and saying `Hi.'''
   The Walshes say they don't regret missing the typical high
school scene. And they offer their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores
in defense of their academic preparation: 1,280 for Tammy and 1,080
for Michelle, compared to the 1987 national average of 906 out of a
possible 1,600.
   ``They gave you a book and you had to read the whole book, no
matter what,'' Tammy said. ``I think that's a big difference. I
know people who say they never finished a textbook.''

<HEAD>House Panel Probing Corruption Chargers in Pacific Trust Territory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee is investigating
possible government corruption in the U.S. trust territory of
Palau, including allegations that senior Palau officials may be
involved in heroin smuggling.
   The probe was disclosed this week by Chairman Morris Udall,
D-Ariz., and Del. Ron de Lugo, D-Virgin Islands, chairman of the
Interior subcommittee on insular and international affairs.
   The lawmakers, in statements not disputed by Palauan or U.S.
officials, quoted the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as
saying that the Pacific islands ``are being used to transship
heroin from Southeast Asia to the U.S.''
   In a letter sent Wednesday to Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Udall and de Lugo
said ``several senior Palauan government officials have been
identified to us as being connected to this drug trade.''
   The letter cited no basis for the accusation against the
unidentified officials. Jeff Farrow, staff director for de Lugo's
subcommittee, said: ``It's coming from our investigation. That's
all we can say at this point.''
   Haruo Willter, Palau's acting Washington representative,
acknowledged that his country has a drug problem, ``the same as the
United States.'' As for the involvement of senior officials, he
said: ``These allegations are made by individuals. I have seen no
specific accusations with names.''
   Howard Hills, counsel for interagency affairs at the State
Department, said: ``We've been aware of allegations of drug
trafficking _ including allegations of officials being involved _
for years, and we don't understand why the Interior Committee is
treating them as new.''
   The letter said the committee investigation also involves
allegations of corruption and bribery among high-ranking Palau
officials, misappropriation of federal and local funds and violence
against Palauans opposed to a long-term compact linking the United
States and Palau.
   Palau and the Reagan administration are pressing Congress to
approve a resolution to implement the compact, leading to the end
of a U.N.-sanctioned trusteeship the United States has exercised
over Palau for 40 years. Palau is the world's last United Nations
trust territory.
   Under the arrangement, the United States would provide economic
assistance and military protection for Palau, which the Pentagon
sees as a backup location in case this country loses its military
bases in the Philippines.
   The Interior Committee has made no move toward voting on the
resolution, which was endorsed Thursday by two subcommittees of the
Foreign Affairs Committee. There was no mention of the drug
allegations before their votes.
   About 14,000 people live on the eight permanently inhabited
islands of Palau, which comprises more than 200 islands in the
Caroline chain. Most of the inhabitants live in Koror, the capital,
some 4,450 miles southwest of Honolulu and 720 miles south of Guam.
   In a letter last October to de Lugo, DEA Administrator John Lawn
said ``it appears that Palau's primary involvement in international
drug trafficking is as a transshipment point for Southeast Asian
heroin being smuggled to the United States.''
   Lawn said ``marijuana is grown freely throughout'' Palau and
that there may be more than 400 heroin addicts in Palau _ far
higher than the percentage of addicts in the United States.
   Hills said Palau, with help requested from the DEA and Interior
and State departments, is trying to combat the problem. He said
that 25 marijuana and heroin suspects were arrested in ``a major
bust'' Tuesday in Palau.
   About the accusation that senior officials could be involved
with heroin smuggling, Hills said, ``The issue of who's involved is
not going to be commented on because it's under investigation by
the government of Palau.''
   He said Congress should move to sever the trusteeship because
Palauan independence and increased U.S. aid would give the islands'
government more resources to combat its problems.
   Udall and de Lugo also cited last summer's violence in Palau
surrounding a plebiscite in which a majority of Palauans voted to
change their constitution's strong prohibition on nuclear weapons
in their country.
   Palauan dissidents have questioned the legality of the
plebiscite. A lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the vote
was withdrawn because of government-fostered intimidation,
dissidents have told Congress.
   Udall and de Lugo said they won't act on the resolution until
Palau's judiciary rules on the plebiscite's legality or the
dissidents say they won't renew the lawsuit.
   The resolution approved by the Foreign Affairs subcommittees
says the Reagan administration can implement the compact with Palau
unless a legal challenge to the plebiscite is pending.

<HEAD>Officials From 3 States Inspect Florida's Canker-Treatment Methods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Agriculture officials from Arizona, Texas
and Louisiana came to see for themselves whether Florida was doing
all it can to prevent citrus canker from traveling in fruit
shipments to their states.
   ``We are trying to assess the level of confidence we can place
on the procedures being taken so that we can determine what
inspection methods we need in our state,'' said Arizona's director
of agriculture and horticulture, Ivan J. Shields.
   Shields joined Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner and
regulatory and technical officials from the two other states in a
tour of Florida citrus nurseries, groves and packinghouse
facilities in the Indian River and interior areas of Florida's
citrus belt.
   ``Florida fruit presents no threat to their citrus industries,
and we want to assure them of that,'' Conner said in Orlando prior
to their departure in three small airplanes to Fort Pierce, Winter
Haven, Frostproof and Lake Wales.
   Conner invited the representatives from the three states and
California as a partial answer to embargoes on Florida fresh fruit
shipments imposed by Texas and Louisiana shortly after the U.S.
Department of Agriculture last month lifted a 3-year-old ban on
Florida shipments to other citrus-growing areas.
   Florida Citrus Mutual, an organization representing 12,000
growers, and Tuxedo Fruit Co. of Fort Pierce went into federal
court and obtained a temporary injunction against the Texas
embargo. The first Florida truckloads of fruit were expected to
reach Texas this weekend.
   Conner said Florida also was prepared to challenge a Louisiana
ban from the southern part of the state, where about 1,000 acres of
fruit is grown.
   California, which did not send a representative to Florida on
Friday, and Arizona have not interfered with Florida shipments.
   The USDA ban was lifted after a joint state-federal scientific
task force determined that there was little threat to other
citrus-growing states by the Florida nursery strain of the tree and
fruit disease, which resulted in the voluntary destruction of 20
million young trees in the last three years.
   John W. Impson, state entomologist for the Louisiana Department
of Agriculture, said there was little worry about Florida's
procedures. ``Our concern is monitoring, in our state in
particular,'' by the USDA, he said.
   Florida, which is the largest domestic producer, has almost
600,000 acres of commercial citrus. Most of it is processed into
juice, but its fresh-fruit exports to other citrus-growing states
constitute an annual market of about $25 million.
   California has traditionally been the second-largest producer,
with Texas third, followed by Arizona, Louisiana and Hawaii. A 1983
freeze in Texas dropped its annual production to about 115,000 tons
on 22,000 acres of groves, however. Arizona has 35,500 acres
yielding about 485,000 tons.
   Citrus canker threatens commercial citrus groves because it is
easily spread. It mars leaves and fruit, making it unmarketable,
and can damage stems and twigs, causing a general decline of trees.
The fruit is edible, however.
   Florida's juice-processing industry has not been affected
because, except for the small Gulf Coast region, the disease has
not spread into commercial groves.
   Canker does not affect humans.

   The School Board has prohibited students from
carrying electronic telephone beepers, following administrators'
complaints that students were using them to arrange drug deals.
   When the ban vote Thursday takes effect, March 14, students
found carrying a beeper face suspension.
   ``At the high school and middle school level, if a child is in
possession of an operational beeper, they are usually dealing
drugs,'' said Arthur Pierce, principal of Francis M. Wood High
School. ``At the elementary level, kids are wearing inoperative
beepers to appear tough or macho and mimic the older kids. And
that's not something to encourage.''
   Pierce and other principals said they don't have figures, but
Pierce said the number of beepers showing up in schools is
alarming. Pierce said he has been confiscating pagers at his school
for three years.
   Virtually all drug possession arrests in city schools involve
marijuana, police said.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb was discovered today about 300 yards
from U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's hotel and police said
the explosives were dismantled safely.
   In Beirut, Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation
Organization guerrilla group, Fatah, claimed responsibility said
Shultz was the target.
   The car had been driven into a wall and abandoned. A passing
officer thought the vehicle looked suspicious and discovered the
bomb, Jerusalem police commander Yosef Yehudai said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokewoman said the car bomb was nowhere near the
route Shultz was scheduled to travel today between the hotel and
Israeli government offices.
   Fatah, in a communique telephoned to The Associated Press office
in west Beirut, said its military command ``instructed the Limassol
martyrs group to park a bomb-laden car in front of the Hilton Hotel
in Jerusalem targeting Shultz, the messenger of imperialism.''
   Three PLO officials were killed in a car bomb explosion in the
Cypriot port of Limassol Feb. 14. The PLO blamed Israel's Mossad
secret service for the bombing.
   The Fatah communique identified the vehicle in Jerusalem as a
French-designed Renault-4 and said it was ``packed with 35
kilograms (77 pounds) of TNT.''
   ``The driver had an accident and the car crashed into a power
pole about 30 minutes before the time set for the bomb to
explode,'' the communique said. ``The driver deserted the vehicle
and managed to escape.''
   It said the attack was meant to be ``a response to the Zionists'
(Israelis') brutality against our people in the occupied
territories.''
   ``We warn Shultz and all agents of imperialism against reaching
out for the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people,'' the communique added.
   The vehicle was abandoned near a shopping mall and close to the
city's central bus station. It was northwest of the Hilton Hotel,
where Shultz spent Thursday night.
   Yehudai told the radio 22 pounds of explosives, ``a quantity
that could have caused a great deal of damage,'' and a mechanism to
set it off was found inside the vehicle. No arrests were reported.
   It was the second day in a row that a car bomb was discovered in
Israel. On Thursday, a car bomb exploded outside the central bus
station in Kfar Saba, northeast of Tel Aviv. No injuries were
reported.
   ``During the night we received a report of a car involved in a
regular accident not involving other cars,'' Yehudai said on the
radio about today's car bomb.
   ``Later, the chief police explosives expert passed by and
through his own experience decided the car was indeed suspicious
... We found it was a car bomb.''
   He said the discovery happened by accident.
   ``Its discovery and dismantling prevented a damaging attack,''
Yehudai said of the car bomb. ``It looks like this is the new `hit'
tactic of the terrorists.''
   An additional police statement said the car was registered to
Israelis living in Tel Aviv and had not been reported stolen.
   The area around where the car was found was closed to all
traffic for more than an hour. The vehicle was towed to a police
laboratory for further tests, the statement said.

<HEAD>Report Says Reagan Budget Would Trigger Gramm-Rudman Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget would
produce a deficit of $165 billion, a congressional report said
Friday, an amount that would trigger massive automatic spending
cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law.
   The deficit estimate by the Congressional Budget Office is $30
billion higher than the amount of red ink the White House Office of
Management and Budget says the president's spending plan would
create.
   The differences are mainly because CBO is more pessimistic about
the how the economy will perform than the administration is.
   The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law calls for a $136 billion
deficit target in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. If final
figures indicate the deficit will exceed that amount by more than
$10 billion, domestic and defense spending would be slashed
automatically by whatever amount it takes to shrink the deficit to
$136 billion.
   The final deficit estimate, however, is made by OMB, with CBO
playing only an advisory role. According to OMB, Reagan's $1.1
trillion budget would leave $130 billion in red ink and no
automatic cuts would occur.
   Some lawmakers have expressed concern about the pessimistic
economic and deficit forecasts that CBO has made this year. But
with 1988 an election year, Congress is not expected to seriously
challenge OMB's numbers and commence a painful round of spending
cuts and tax increases.
   Acting CBO director James L. Blum, who presented the report to
the Senate Appropriations Committee, told the legislators that
deciding which set of forecasts to trust is ``a political judgment
call'' for them to make.
   CBO expects slower economic growth and higher inflation and
interest rates in the next two years than the administration does.
All of those factors would produce higher government spending and
lower revenue collections than the White House anticipates.
   Blum conceded that recent economic statistics have been better
than expected.
   ``It would appear that the pronounced slowdown we were expecting
in the first quarter (of 1988) is not materializing,'' he said.
   CBO is also more pessimistic than the administration about
longer-range efforts to reduce the deficit. While the White House
says the deficit will drop to $104 billion in 1990 and $23 billion
by 1993, the congressional agency says the deficit will be $157
billion in 1990 and $109 billion in 1993.
   Gramm-Rudman requires a balanced budget by 1993.
   The House and Senate budget committees are expected to begin
writing their own versions of the 1989 budget soon. But neither is
expected to propose any budget-cutting much beyond that proposed in
the president's plan. Reagan's spending blueprint adheres closely
to the so-called budget summit agreement he reached with
congressional leaders last November.
   Among its projections, CBO said:
   _The economy will grow by 1.8 percent this year, compared with
the administration's estimate of 2.4 percent.
   _Inflation will be 4.9 percent in 1988, contrasted with a White
House forecast of 4.3 percent.
   _Enactment of Reagan's entire budget would reduce the deficit by
$12 billion below what it would be if no further deficit-reduction
action were taken.

<TEXT>
   Sikh separatists sprayed automatic rifle
fire into hundreds of people celebrating a Hindu religious holiday,
killing at least 34 people and wounding about 45, police said
Friday.
   The attackers burst into a courtyard where Hindus, Sikhs and
Christians had come together to celebrate Holi, the festival of
light, in the northern state of Punjab.
   ``People ran helter-skelter. There were bodies on the ground,
and the injured were crying,'' said Mahavir Prashad, who was inside
a building and escaped injury.
   ``I tried to save some of the injured by giving them water, but
most of them died in my arms,'' he said.
   Several hours after the killings, the Indian government released
five Sikh high priests and 40 Sikh militants in an apparent peace
overture. They included Jasbir Singh Rode, who was arrested in 1984
during an army raid on the Sikh's Golden Temple.
   Rode, the chief priest at the temple during the raid, returned
in triumph to the temple. Cheering Sikhs emerged and fired about
400 rounds into the air from their rifles.
   Sikhs are a religious minority in India and say they are
discriminated against by the majority Hindus. Sikh militants are
fighting for a separate homeland in Punjab.
   Asked whether his release would pave the way for talks with the
government, Rode said: ``We shall see how serious and sincere the
government is before deciding who will talk and on what basis.''
   About 900 people were in the courtyard when six to eight gunmen
opened fire with AK-47 rifles about 11:30 p.m. Thursday, a senior
police official said. The massacre occurred in Kari Sari, about 80
miles east of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
   For the past century, Sikhs and Christians have joined Hindus in
Kari Sari to celebrate Holi, a national holiday commemorating the
Hindu god Lord Krishna's triumph over evil.
   Bonfires had been lighted, the crowd was singing, and a troupe
of actors was performing a series of plays about the lives of Hindu
deities when the gunmen burst in.
   Deputy inspector general A. Siddiqui said at least nine Sikhs
were killed, but he said most victims were Hindus.
   The killings prompted police alerts in Punjab, Haryana and New
Delhi.
   Most of the people in the courtyard were men. Women and children
were sitting on the roof of the hostel. The victims' ages ranged
from 10 to 60. At least two children were among the dead.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police
blamed the Kalistan Commando Force, one of several Sikh separatist
groups.
   Sohan Singh, a 22-year-old Sikh, was shot in the leg. Speaking
from his hospital bed, he said the gunmen spared his life when he
obeyed their command to shout ``Kalistan zindabad (Long live
Kalistan)!''
   Kalistan is the name of the nation Sikhs envision for themselves.
   More than 380 people have been killed by Sikh extremists in
Punjab so far this year.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz flew
in today to discuss American ideas for peace in the Middle East
with the pro-Soviet government of President Hafez Assad.
   Shultz, on his second stop in Damascus in less a week, arrived
from Jerusalem where he had met with Israeli leaders. But his
efforts to promote negotiations on a settlement in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip did not appear to have
made any significant progrees.
   Shultz was greeted at Damascus airport by Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa. The two drove immediately to the Muhajerine
presidential palace for a meeting with Assad.
   He planned to leave for Cairo after the talks with Assad, a
strong critic of Washington's Middle East policies.
   Shultz, on a second, unscheduled swing through the region in the
past week, did not indicate he had achieved any progress in a
statement before leaving Israel.
   ``The president sent me back to work at it some more and while
he told me he'd let me come home tonight, he made it clear that we
would keep pushing and working,'' Shultz said at Ben Gurion
International Airport.
   Israel radio reported that Shultz presented a written version of
his peace proposal to Israel's rival leaders, Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres of the leftist Labor Party.
   Peres is said to favor the proposal while Shamir is believed to
oppose it.
   The radio said Shultz expects Shamir to reply to the American
proposals when the prime minister visits Washington on March 14.
   The draft proposal also was given to Jordan's King Hussein in
London on Thursday, the radio said.
   The plan, which contained no surprises, called for beginning the
peace process with an ``international opening which will lead to
direct talks between Israel and a Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation,'' the radio said.
   It also called for implementing Palestinian self-rule in the
occupied territories this fall and then beginning talks on a
permanent settlement in December.
   Shamir described his 90-minute session with Shultz as ``very
friendly, very useful and promising.'' He said he was sure the
United States and Israel would continue efforts to start peace
talks in the area.
   Shultz then met for about 45 minutes with Peres, who described
Shultz's proposals as ``food for thought.''
   Shultz called the talks ``positive and constructive.''
   Also today, police discovered a car bomb set on a street about
300 yards from the Hilton Hotel where Shultz was staying, and
safely dismantled the explosives. No arrests were reported.
   In Beirut, Lebanon Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrilla group, Fatah, claimed
responsibility for the car bomb and said Shultz was the target.
   Fatah, in a communique telephoned to The Associated Press office
in west Beirut, said its military command ordered commandos ``to
park a bomb-laden car in front of the Hilton Hotel in Jerusalem
targeting Shultz, the messenger of imperialism.''
   ``The driver had an accident and the car crashed into a power
pole about 30 minutes before the time set for the bomb to
explode,'' the communique said.
   ``The driver deserted the vehicle and managed to escape,'' the
communique said.
   According to U.N. figures, rioting since Dec. 8 in the occupied
lands has left at least 76 Palestinians dead, mostly by Israeli
gunfire.
   Palestinians have refused to meet Shultz without approval from
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Islamic fundamentalists circulated leaflets in the Gaza Strip
condemning the Shultz mission and referring to the U.S. official as
``the great evil envoy,'' the Jerusalem Post reported today.
   In Damascus, a leading government newspaper today said the
United States seeks to crush Palestinian protests in Israeli-held
territories rather than find a durable peace settlement.
   The Al-Baath daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Arab
Socialist Party, said in a front-page editorial that the United
States ``was always determined to make Israel the only power in the
region.
   Shultz planned a whirlwind last day in the region. After meeting
with Assad, he was to go to Egypt to meet with President Hosni
Mubarak. On Saturday, he was scheduled to return to Washington.
   Shultz has urged Palestinians to form a joint delegation with
Jordan in peace talks, citing close ties betweeen Jordan and the
1.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Hussein wants a separate seat for the PLO in peace talks, but
Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, saying it is a terrorist
organization.

   A British official from a private relief
organization and his Syrian aide disappeared in Lebanon, and one
official of their group said Friday that they had been kidnapped.
   The purported abduction came near the end of a week that saw two
Scandinavian employees of the United Nations and a West German
engineer released in Lebanon.
   Peter Coleridge, the 44-year-old Middle East coordinator of
Oxfam, and Oxfam's Lebanon representative Omar Traboulsi, 31, a
Syrian, were kidnapped Thursday evening, spokesman John Magrath
said in Oxford, England.
   Coleridge was on his first trip to Lebanon in three years.
   ``We've had conflicting reports as to whether they are still
being held or not,'' Magrath said. But Nissrine Rawda, an official
at Oxfam's Beirut office, said there were ``no eyewitnesses
confirming the abduction.''
   Sunni Moslem leftist leader Mustafa Saad, whose Nasserite
militia controls Sidon, told reporters the two Oxfam officials have
been ``detained for questioning'' by an unidentified Palestinian
group in Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp.
   ``I expect their release within hours, God willing,'' Saad said.
``This is not an abduction. There is a security mishap in the
camp.''
   He said Coleridge had visited the Hittin area south of Ein
el-Hilweh in 1982, when it was devastated by Israel's invading army.
   ``When he returned this time he took pictures of the area's
reconstruction and a group inside the camp seized him for
questioning, fearing he might be taking espionage photographs,''
Saad added.
   Saad declined to name the group which he says is holding
Coleridge and Traboulsi.
   Police in this ancient city 25 miles south of Beirut confirmed
the two men had been missing since the night before, but could not
say for sure how they vanished.
   ``They may have been seized by gunmen of the Molem Ulema
grouping,'' said a Sidon police spokesman who could not be
identified in keeping with regulations. ``We are acting on this
assumption in our investigation.''
   The Moslem Ulema is a fundamentalist Sunni Moslem faction headed
by Sheik Maher Hammoud and is influenced by the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hammoud, however, disclaimed any involvement in the abduction.
   ``Why should I be blamed for every foreigner who is abducted in
Sidon?'' Hammoud told The Associated Press.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the patron of underground factions
holding many of 22 other foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   Beirut radio stations had blamed this group for the abduction of
U.N. Scandinavian relief workers Jan Stening, 44, of Sweden, and
William Jorgensen, 58, of Norway, last month. They were freed
unharmed Tuesday after 25 days of captivity.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, with which the two
Scandinavians served, had blamed their abduction on Palestinians
acting without a political motive.
   Coleridge and Traboulsi traveled to Sidon from Beirut on
Thursday morning on a routine visit to inspect relief groups
supported by Oxfam, a British charity that aids refugees and poor
people in many countries.
   Police said the missing pair had lunch Thursday in Sidon's
Skandarani district with Alia Shammaa, who heads the Ghassan
Kanafani Foundation, a Palestinian charity that receives aid from
Oxfam.
   They left Mrs. Shammaa's house at 3:30 p.m. and went to the
suburban Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp in an orange stationwagon, the
police spokesman said.
   They held a half-hour meeting at Ein el-Hilweh and left to
return to Sidon at 4:15 p.m., the spokesman said.
   The vehicle was last seen at Jerusalem Square, about a half a
mile from Mrs. Shammaa's house, the spokesman said.
   Jerusalem Square is about a 100 yards from Sheik Hammoud's
residence in Sidon, Lebanon's third largest city.
   Mrs. Rawda said Coleridge arrived in Lebanon two days ago on his
first visit to the civil war-torn country in three years. He joined
Oxfam in June 1981 and lives in Oxford with his wife, two daughters
and son. Traboulsi is a bachelor.
   British Ambassador John Gray visited Mrs. Rawda at mid-afternoon
for 15 minutes and said afterwards: ``I have no confirmation of the
(abduction) story one way or the other. I am still trying to check
out the story.''
   The embassy's military attache Col. Patrick Hyland earlier said
the reported abduction was ``a false alarm at the moment.''
   Hyland and Rawda said Coleridge and Traboulsi had been due back
in Beirut later Friday. By sundown there was still no trace of them.
   The reported abduction came a day after pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem kidnappers released West German industrial engineer Ralph
Schray, 30, from 35 days of captivity in west Beirut.
   The 22 foreigners missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon
since 1985 include nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, a
West German, an Irishman, an Italian, an Indian and two
unidentified men.
   Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Soldiers today barred journalists seeking to
enter the occupied West Bank as demonstrations erupted after noon
prayers on the Moslem Sabbath. Two Arabs were reported shot to
death and eight others wounded by Israeli gunfire.
   Authorities also discovered and defused a car bomb near the
central bus station 300 yards from the hotel where U.S. Secretary
of State George P. Shultz was staying. Yasser Arafat's mainstream
Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla group, Fatah, claimed
responsibility and said Shultz was the target.
   The explosives-laden car was discovered by a policeman after it
ran into a wall and was abandoned.
   Shultz met Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres in a final, but apparently inconclusive, effort to
promote Arab-Israel negotiations that would help end riots in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   Hospital officials and Arab press reports said Mohammed Ahmed
Salah, 18, was shot in the head during a demonstration after noon
prayers in the village of Khatar close to Bethlehem. Israeli
photographers said the army imposed a curfew.
   The army said one Palestinian was killed and another wounded in
the West Bank town of Araba between Nablus and Jenin after soldiers
opened fire to quell a riot by hundreds of Arabs, who attacked them
using clubs, bottles and stones.
   The Palestine Press Service said three Arabs were shot and
wounded in the northern city of Jenin. It also said a 40-year-old
woman was wounded in the right leg in the refugee camp of Balata
near Nablus.
   The agency and hospital officials in Nablus reported Jewish
settlers were involved in the shooting of a Palestinian youth in
the village of Burka. The youth, 18, was wounded in the back.
   Officials at Arab Ahli hospital said two Palestinians were
wounded by gunfire at a protest outside Al Amari mosque.
   Before today's violence, the United Nations reported 76 Arabs
have been killed since the violence began Dec. 8.
   Shultz left for Syria to meet President Hafez Assad and then
planned to fly to Cairo for talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak before wrapping up his shuttle Saturday.
   The U.S. proposal calls for peace talks at an international
conference which will lead to direct talks between Israel and a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
   Peres, a member of the Labor Party, has expressed support for
the Shultz plan but Shamir, a member of the right-wing Likud, has
not. Shamir and Peres are bitter rivals in the coalition government.
   The outbreak of violence came despite a crackdown on press
coverage. Israeli officials contend television cameras and still
photographers inflame demonstrations.
   ``There is no policy'' to bar journalists from covering the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, said a senior Defense Ministry official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``It is not a total closure,'' said Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid,
the army spokesman. He said local commanders had been authorized to
bar journalists and indicated some areas were closed because noon
prayers often end in violent demonstrations.
   A tightening of restrictions on press coverage had been expected
after Shamir warned he was considering closing occupied zones to
journalists, whom he accused of being biased against Israel.
   Robert Slate, chairman of the Foreign Press Association, said
restrictions had been expected after Shamir's warning.
   ``I'm appalled but not surprised,'' Slater said. ``The question
is whether this is limited to Fridays or more general.''
   It was not immediately known if army roadblocks were set up in
the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The U.S. Embassy said the car bomb found in Jerusalem was not
along a route Shultz was to travel today. It was not clear when the
bomb was to have gone off. Police said it had a detonating
mechanism, but did not elaborate.
   The vehicle was abandoned near a shopping mall and close to the
city's central bus station. It was northwest of the Hilton Hotel,
where Shultz spent Thursday night.
   Fatah, in a communique telephoned to The Associated Press office
in west Beirut, said its military command ordered commandos ``to
park a bomb-laden car in front of the Hilton Hotel in Jerusalem
targeting Shultz, the messenger of imperialism.''
   ``The driver had an accident and the car crashed into a power
pole about 30 minutes before the time set for the bomb to
explode,'' the communique said. ``The driver deserted the vehicle
and managed to escape.''
   Authorities said it was unclear if the driver was on his way
elsewhere when the vehicle was driven into a wall or had abandoned
the car intentionally.
   The Jerusalem Post quoted a leaflet issued by the militant
Islamic Jihad, which called for a three-day general strike starting
today in Gaza. The leaflet linked the strike to Shultz's mission.
   The leaflet called Shultz ``the great evil envoy'' and said his
mission was designed to stop the three-month uprising by the 1.5
million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, which Israeli
seized in the 1967 Middle East war.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has invoked
the powers of a good luck charm during his Middle East shuttle: a
white peace dove in his Jerusalem hotel lobby.
   Whenever Shultz passed through the lobby of the Jerusalem
Hilton, he pulled a silver-and-white ribbon hanging from the dove,
sending the bird's wings flapping.
   ``When I came here about seven or eight days ago to start the
process, I went into the hotel and there, hanging from the ceiling,
was a bird _ a great big thing on a little rope you pull and the
wings go and the dove flies,'' Shultz said Friday.
   ``So I pulled it when I came in and everybody clapped and I keep
pulling it whenever I go through there in the hope that it will
bring us good fortune,'' Shultz said. He made his comments after
meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres.
   ``And that is what I wish to the people of Israel, to the
Palestinians, to the people of all the neighboring countries that I
have visited, good fortune and peace,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz arrived in Jerusalem on Feb. 25 for a five-day Middle
East shuttle, and returned to the region Thursday night for a
second round of talks with Arab and Israeli leaders.
   The wooden dove measures 13 feet by 13 feet and has an aluminium
olive branch in its beak. Hotel spokesman Motti Verses said the
bird would remain hanging in the lobby because of rumors that
Shultz would return to the region by the end of March.

<HEAD>Audit Panel Sees Nothing in Way of Resumed Shuttle Flights</HEAD>

   An outside committee that audited NASA's
recovery from the Challenger disaster for 14 months said Friday it
finds no safety flaws serious enough to delay the resumption of
space shuttle flights.
   The first mission, with the shuttle Discovery, is scheduled for
Aug. 4.
   ``We are all quite comfortable with what's been done to get
ready for the next flight,'' retired Gen. Alton Slay, chairman of
the National Research Council committee, told reporters.
   ``We find absolutely no show-stoppers,'' Slay said. ``Space
travel will always entail risks. It cannot be reduced to zero. The
key to minimizing those risks is to identify the most likely
hazards or failures and to take steps to eliminate them or control
them if they cannot be eliminated.''
   But coupled with the praise was a strong recommendation that the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration tighten the ways it
assesses and manages risks associated with the shuttle.
   ``No matter how good you are, you never reach Mecca,'' said
Slay. ``There is always room for improvement.''
   The committee's central finding, he said, is that NASA is able
to assess and manage risks associated with space flights, but uses
so many review boards and safety organizations that the result is
``a fragmented picture of the safety and reliability of the total
space transportation system.''
   Further, Slay said, those organizations rely on subjective
assessments of risk posed by thousands of individual space shuttle
components, rather than on engineering evaluations.
   ``Their procedures and their oganizations need policing up,''
Slay said. ``They need to do more to integrate their risk
assessment and risk management. They need more to take advantage of
all the data that does exist in their decision-making process.''
   Slay defined risk assessment as ``saying on any particular piece
of hardware, what is the likelihood this is going to cause a
problem if it is going to fail ... and if it fails, will it cascade
into some other system and cause a problem there?''
   Asked if better risk assessment might have stopped the ill-fated
launch of the Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, Slay replied:
   ``No one can say that for sure. The only thing we can say for
sure is if these procedures had been in place, we would have had
more information at our fingertips. Whether the engineering
judgments that they made at the time would have bveen different,
who can say?''
   Challenger's seven-member crew was killed when the shuttle
exploded 73 seconds after launch.
   William Lenoir, a former astronaut who flew on the shuttle in
1982, said the bulk of the recommendations in the 144-page report
has already been put in effect by NASA and that the report
contained no surprises for the agency.
   NASA said it will carefully review the report. Agency
Administrator James C. Fletcher said NASA owes the National
Research Council a vote of thanks.
   ``I am particfdularly gratified that the council did not find
any show-stoppers that, in their opinion, should delay the next
launch of the space shuttle, now set for August,'' he said.
   Lenoir, whose planned spacewalk was scrubbed by a malfunctioning
space suit, said he is worried that the Challenger accident may
have made NASA personnel gun-shy.
   ``We need to be careful that we don't go overboard and keep
trying to make it safe enough, a little bit safer and a little bit
safer, and we may never fly again because we'll never make it 100
percent safe,'' he said. ``I believe the right processses are in
place.''
   The committee review was recommended by the presidential
commission that investigated the Challenger accident. The National
Research Council acts as a scientific advisory group to the federal
government and is administered by the National Academy of Sciences,
the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.

<HEAD>Paper Accuses Australia of Meddling With Walesa Invitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Friday
accused Australia of interfering in Polish affairs by supporting an
invitation to Solidarity leader Lech Walesa to attend a trade union
congress in Melbourne.
   The government said Tuesday it would bar Walesa and three top
aides from traveling to Australia to attend the union congress.
Officials said they were acting to protect the state's ``basic
political interests.''
   Friday's commentary appeared in Trybuna Ludu, the official daily
of the party.
   The Australian Embassy in Warsaw said allowing Walesa to visit
Australia would improve relations between the two countries and
show that Poland was making progress in enacting reforms.
   It said Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke had ``presented the
argument that a country's standing is enhanced if it permits a
citizen, albeit a controversial one, to go abroad where he can
speak freely.''
   The Australian Council of Trade Unions invited the Poles to
attend the World Congress of the International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions from March 14-18.
   Trybuna Ludu said inviting members of an illegal organization
was ``a provocative action against Poland'' and ignored ``the real
fact of the existence in Poland of a ... reborn trade union
movement.''
   The newspaper was referring to the All-Poland Trade Union
Alliance, the official labor federation set up with government
backing after Solidarity was outlawed in October 1982 that claims
about 7 million members.
   Walesa, contacted by telephone at his Gdansk apartment, said
such personal attacks in Trybuna Ludu were not new. He added that
the article showed ``who is standing behind the allegedly
independent (official) trade unions.''
   He called it strange that the state should try to force
international recognition for the official trade unions by barring
him from traveling to Australia.
   Walesa has not traveled abroad since the December 1981 martial
law crackdown that suppressed Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first
free trade union. The Gdansk shipyard worker helped found
Solidarity in 1980 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983.
   Walesa has not yet received a formal refusal of his application,
said an aide. Also invited to Australia were Wroclaw Solidarity
leader Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Gdansk leader Bogdan Lis and senior
adviser Bronislaw Geremek.

   A computer technician charged with
killing seven people during a Silicon Valley shooting rampage won't
have to enter a plea for a week, a judge ruled Friday.
   Richard Wade Farley was to enter a plea Friday to charges
stemming from the Feb. 9 shooting at ESL Inc., a defense contractor
in Sunnyvale. Judge Hugh Mullin III granted an extension at the
request of Farley's lawyer, Gregory C. Paraskou, who said he needed
more time to review 600 pages of police reports.
   Farley was expressionless throughout the brief proceeding.
   Prosecutor Alan Nudelman has indicated he will seek the death
penalty for Farley, who allegedly escalated a fantasy love affair
with an engineer into a six-hour siege, shooting his way through
the halls of ESL. Seven people died and five others were hurt.

<TEXT>
   The independent Postal Rate Commission
recommended a sweeping series of increases in U.S. postage rates
Friday, including boosting the cost of first class letters to 25
cents.
   But the agency also put forth a proposal to charge consumers
less than a quarter for paying bills and recommended that
advertising mail rates increase by even larger percentages than
other groups.
   The complex series of rate proposals now goes to the board of
governors of the Postal Service, which requested rate hikes 10
months ago. The new rates could be ordered into effect within 10
days to two weeks, with the governors likely to consider the matter
next week.
   Overall, the rate commission recommended a series of postage
rate hikes totaling 17.5 percent, somewhat more than the Postal
Service request for a 16 percent increase.
   The higher rates are necessary for the postal service to avoid a
deficit which could total more than $5 billion by 1989, rate
commission chairman Janet Steiger said.
   The agency agreed with the postal service's original request to
set the rate for first class letters at 25 cents, up from the
current 22 cents.
   At that rate, sending a letter to Aunt Maude would take about
the same bite from the average wallet as it did in 1932. Adjusted
for inflation, the 3 cent postage rate introduced in 1932 would
amount to 25.5 cents today.
   Noting that typical consumers are one of the few groups that
don't get any discounts for bulk mail, the commission made an
innovative proposal to give these people a break.
   It suggested a new courtesy mail discount, in which business
could prepare special envelopes with proper coding and ZIP codes
for automatic processing, and which would be addressed to post
office boxes to save carrier delivery.
   Consumers using these envelopes, for example to pay bills or
respond to an advertisement, would be given a discount on the
postage. The agency didn't suggest an amount of the discount, but
said the Postal Service should study the costs and come up with an
amount.
   The rate commission did recommend a 2 cent cut in the current 7
cent minimum cost for pre-paid business reply envelopes in order to
encourage companies to provide these for consumers.
   In the first class category, the price for each additional ounce
of mail would rise from 17 cents to 20 cents, as requested by the
postal service.
   But the cost for a post card would increase from 14 cents to 15
cents, a penny less than had been requested.
   Overall, first class rates would increase 14.7 percent, the rate
commission said.
   Third class mail, however, which is mostly advertising and is
widely termed ``junk mail,'' would have a 25 percent cost hike.
   The rate commission said in studying costs it determined that
this type of mail was responsible for more postal service costs
than it was paying, and thus should have a larger increase.
   The minimum rate for third class mail would jump from 12.5 cents
to 16.7 cents, slightly more than the postal service had requested.
The per pound rate would rise from 38 cents to 48 cents, 3 cents
more than asked.
   For non-profit advertising mail the minimum rate would increase
from 8.5 cents to 8.7 cents, slightly less than the 9 cents
suggested by the Postal Service.
   Second class mail _ newspapers and magazines for the most part _
would face overall increases of just over 18 percent.
   Newspapers sent within the county would rise to 9.8 cents per
pound and 3.4 cents to 5.9 cents per piece. The current rate is 9.1
cents per pound and 3.1 cents to 4.9 cents per item.
   The commission agreed to a Postal Service proposal for a $8.75
rate for the highly competitive Express overnight mail.
   While some employee retirement costs anticipated by the postal
service turned out to be less than expected, the saving was eaten
up by other amounts, including a poorer than hoped-for showing in
cost-cutting programs, Steiger said.
   When the new rates take effect they will end the prices
structure that took effect Feb. 17, 1985.
   ``Compared to other small necessities we commonly purchase _
from toothpaste to ground coffee _ this is a very modest
increase,'' Postal Board Chairman John N. Griesemer said last May
when proposing the increases.
   He estimated the additional cost of postage to the average
individual would be less than $10 per year.
   The Postal Service is required to break even _ over time _ by
the 1970 law that made it an independent federal agency and ended
the taxpayer subsidy for the mail.
   The Postal Service has been in the black five of the last 10
years. It finished last year with a $223 million loss after showing
a $305 million surplus in 1986.
   A special, nondenominated ``E'' stamp has been prepared for use
when the new rates take effect.
   Because the agency had no way of knowing what rate would be
recommended it had the E stamps printed for use at whatever the
rate turned out to be.
   The E stamps features a space-based image of the Earth and may
be used only for domestic mail.
   Overseas mail rates, currently 44 cents for letters, are not
affected by the new recommendation.

   Pat Robertson's quest for the Republican
presidential nomination is approaching a crossroads on his Southern
home ground.
   Winless one month into the primary season, he has been
predicting things will change when he reaches the South. The
region's contests kick off with the South Carolina primary
Saturday, followed three days later by Super Tuesday.
   At times, his presidential effort has seemed as much crusade as
campaign.
   The former television evangelist's rhetoric is filled with
references to morality, religion and patriotism. His campaign song
is titled ``For God and Country'' and he calls for the nation's
return to ``the bedrock of faith in God.''
   ``Government doesn't give us our freedom,'' he said at a rally
Monday night in Miami. ``It is a gift of God given every one of
us.''
   Robertson's enemies are communists, congressmen who vote against
aid to Nicaraguan Contra rebels and Supreme Court justices who
won't permit prayer in public schools.
   Although the son of a U.S. senator, Robertson has never held
public office and stresses he is running as an outsider against the
political establishment.
   ``I want you to know I am not a politician. Nobody has any hooks
in me,'' he told about 1,000 wildly cheering supporters at a rally
here Tuesday night. ``I am free to serve God as my conscience
dictates.''
   Yet his political organization has won the grudging admiration
of opposing campaign officials, turning out large crowds of
enthusiastic supporters and giving him some impressive showings in
caucus states.
   ``This is the big one for me,'' Robertson said of South Carolina
after coming in last in the New Hampshire primary.
   He has acknowledged his campaign will be in trouble if he loses
South Carolina, which appears made to order for his God-and-country
message. The state is conservative, rooted in the Bible Belt and
has crossover voting that will permit Democrats to cast ballots in
the Republican primary.
   However, a new Washington Post poll on Friday indicated that
Robertson was far behind in the state. The poll, of 1,000 likely
Republican voters, showed Vice President George Bush with the
support of 49 percent, Sen. Bob Dole with 26 percent and Robertson
with 14 percent.
   The survey said that even among voters who said they watch
television evangelists almost every week, Bush got 44 percent to
Robertson's 27 percent.
   Robertson's campaign may still be in trouble even if he wins
South Carolina.
   In Florida and Texas, the two biggest prizes of Super Tuesday,
public opinion polls show him a poor third to Bush and Dole.
   Robertson also has been dogged by questions about some of his
public statements during the past couple weeks _ including
suggesting the Bush campaign leaked information about evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart's sexual indiscretions in an attempt to smear
Robertson by association.
   He also has revived a claim that there are Soviet missiles in
Cuba, despite denials from the Reagan administration. He raised
eyebrows with a contention that his Christian TV network knew of
the whereabouts of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   And he is trying to drop a $35 million libel suit against former
Rep. Paul McCloskey, R-Calif. The trial is to begin on Super
Tuesday in Washington. McCloskey, an ex-Marine who had been on the
same troop ship with Robertson during the Korean War, had written a
letter alleging Robertson avoided combat duty in Korea through his
father's political influence.
   Robertson made a swing through Florida on Monday and Tuesday,
concentrating heavily on wooing Miami's Cuban-American voters by
repeating the Cuban missile claim and pledging to support the
exiles' ``right of belligerence,'' although he acknowledged later
that he could do so only within the constraints of U.S. law.
   About 800 people, mostly Hispanic, turned out at a Miami rally,
a disappointment because Robertson campaign staffers had been
predicting nearly twice as many would attend. But his crowds
generally have been bigger than those of other presidential
candidates.
   In Orlando, some supporters held up signs indicating they had
come from towns miles away. In interviews, several of his Orlando
supporters said they had watched Robertson for years on his ``700
Club'' program and Christian Broadcasting Network.
   ``The reason I say we need Pat ... we've got to have the
Christian principles that our forefathers founded this nation
with,'' said Clair Baker, an electronics worker from Clermont.
``We've got to get back to that or we're all down the tubes.''
   Former Florida Republican Chairman Tommy Thomas, who was
President Reagan's state campaign chairman and now is active in the
Bush camp, conceded Robertson is well organized, his supporters are
loyal and a high percentage of them will go to the polls.
   But, he said, there just aren't enough of them to give Robertson
a victory in Florida where Democrats cannot cross over into the GOP
primary.
   In Texas, Bush has a home court advantage over Robertson and
Dole as it is the vice president's adopted home state.
   Bush also has strong Florida connections through his son, Jeb,
former local party chairman in Dade County where the Cuban-American
vote is centered. He is now the state's commerce secretary. Also,
the GOP establishment in Florida, from Gov. Bob Martinez, a
national Bush campaign co-chairman, on down has lined up strongly
behind the vice president.

   A paramedic says his heart pounded as he
responded to an emergency call, dashed into the home and found his
65-year-old mother unconscious on the floor.
   But Michael Flaherty said professional skills kicked in as he
delivered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   ``He saved his mother's life,'' said Ronald Smith, chief
paramedic for the Chicago Fire Department. ``He brought her back.''
   ``You always wonder what would happen if it is somebody you
know,'' Flaherty said. ``You hope it isn't anything serious, but
you expect the worst.''
   Flaherty's parents were having breakfast Wednesday when his
mother, Theresa, collapsed. His father called for an ambulance.
   ``When I heard the address, I could have run there faster than
the ambulance, if that had been necessary,'' Flaherty said.
``Nobody was going to beat us to that address.''
   Flaherty's father, Peter, who is not trained in cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, applied chest compressions before the younger
Flaherty and his partner, Jake Willens, arrived.
   Mrs. Flaherty was rushed to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston
where she was reported in good condition Friday, said spokesman Bob
Olander. ``It's not a heart attack. It's a condition leading up to
a heart attack,'' he said.
   ``No paramedic or firefighter wants to resuscitate or work on
his own parents or children or friends,'' Flaherty said. ``But when
something happens and you have to do it, you react.''
   Flaherty said that after the emergency some people asked him,
``How could you treat your own mother?'
   ``How can you say I can't do it?'' he replied.
   ``The fact it was my mother didn't make any difference in the
way I treated her,'' he said. ``I would have done the same thing
for any other patient. There are 26 nursing homes in the area our
ambulance serves. I treat each of those patients like they were my
mother or father.''

   A teen-ager was jailed Friday after police
found at his home the remains of Confederate Army Major John David
Walker, who has been dead for 125 years.
   Police Detective T.W. Carr said Walker's remains were stolen
last year from a private cemetery near Augusta College.
   James Bruce Meyer, 17, of Augusta, was arrested Thursday night
on a felony charge of wanton desecration of a grave, officials
said. Police recovered Walker's skull and pelvis, assorted other
bones and the handles from his casket at Meyer's home.
   A relative of the dead soldier, 61-year-old Adele Shearer, had
reported to police last October that his remains had been stolen.
   Meyer was being held on bond Friday at the Augusta-Richmond
County Law Enforcement Center, and the investigation was continuing.
   Walker was killed in the second Battle of Bull Run on Aug. 30,
1862.

   Here is a rundown of the historical cost of
mailing a first-class letter in the United States.
   In the first half of the 19th century the cost of sending a
single sheet of paper 40 miles or less was between 6 cents and 8
cents, with the cost rising by distance. Letters going 400 miles
and over cost 25 cents to send per sheet of paper.
   By the middle of that century postage stamps were introduced,
along with standard rates regardless of distance traveled. These
started at 2 cents per half-ounce in 1863, rising to 3 cents in
1883.
   In 1885 the current first-class standard based on 1 ounce was
started. The 1 ounce rates since then have been:
   July 1, 1885: 2 cents.
   Nov. 3, 1917: 3 cents.
   July 1, 1919: 2 cents.
   July 6, 1932: 3 cents.
   Aug. 1, 1958: 4 cents.
   Jan. 7, 1963: 5 cents.
   Jan. 7, 1968: 6 cents.
   May 16, 1971: 8 cents.
   March 2, 1974: 10 cents.
   Dec. 31, 1975: 13 cents.
   May 29, 1978: 15 cents.
   March 22, 1981: 18 cents.
   Nov. 1, 1981: 20 cents.
   Feb. 17, 1985: 22 cents.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Visits Completed Glass Pyramid At Louvre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand on Friday toured the
tall glass pyramid capping the new entrance to the Louvre museum,
finally finished after six years of controversy and delay.
   The 72-foot-high pyramid is set between the museum's two main
wings and tops three underground levels, which are still under
construction. The lower levels will house a main foyer, boutiques,
information desks, snack bars, storage rooms, restoration studios
and other services.
   The new $17.5 million complex won't be open to the public until
the end of the year.
   Mitterrand, accompanied by Culture Minister Francois Leotard and
other government officials, awarded the Legion of Honor medal to
I.M. Pei, the Chinese-American architect who designed the pyramid.
   ``Here is a man who is not only in love with the Louvre, but
also with French history,'' Mitterrand said following the visit.
``I knew he would do nothing to take away from the beauty and the
history of the site.''
   Mitterrand said he had seen examples of Pei's work in Washington
and Boston, and was taken with his pure, geometric forms.
   ``I guess you could say I like pure and simple shapes better
than any others,'' he said.
   Starting next year, the pyramid will be the Louvre's only
above-ground entrance, though there will be direct access from
nearby subway stations and underground parking lots.
   The three underground levels form a hub and will be connected to
the Louvre's two miles of painting and sculpture galleries by
corridors resembling the spokes of a giant wheel.
   The pyramid is but a small portion of a $2.6 billion overall
moderization.
   It was met with considerable resistance from public groups, art
historians and political leaders after it was unveiled early in
Mitterrand's presidential term, but he remained committed to it.
   Renovations of the museum have been delayed by Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur's refusal to vacate the sumptuous offices in the
Louvre's northern wing, his ministry's preserve for decades. The
Finance Ministry is supposed to move by the end of the year to new
quarters in eastern Paris.

   A storm blamed for at least nine deaths spread rain and snow
across the East on Friday after spraying a thick layer of ice
across the Midwest that snapped trees and power lines and blacked
out more than 70,000 customers.
   Many of the power outages were fixed Friday but highways
remained slippery.
   The storm was blamed for five traffic deaths Thursday in Ohio
and four Wednesday in Texas.
   Up to 4 inches of snow fell Friday from Pennsylvania across New
York state into southern Vermont. On Thursday, 5 to 9 inches of
snow fell on Ohio with 5 to 8 inches in Indiana.
   Icy roads made travel hazardous and created traffic jams Friday
morning in Ohio, and numerous school closings were reported today
because of the storm.
   Slippery roads sent two school buses skidding off the pavement
in separate incidents just a few miles apart northeast of Albany,
N.Y., but none of the 13 children involved suffered serious injury,
state police said.
   Heavy rain fell over parts of the South and flash flood watches
were posted Friday for southeastern Alabama and the Florida
panhandle.
   Freezing rain that fell Thursday in Indiana, Ohio and Illinois
thickly layered roads, bridges, trees and power lines with as much
as 2 inches of ice. Freezing rain also spread Friday into
Pennsylvania and northern Kentucky.
   ``We are calling it the most serious storm in our company's
history,'' said Indiana Power & Light Co. spokeswoman Jan Lower.
   Erik Johnson of IPL said about 56,000 homes had experienced
outages at one time or another since Thursday afternoon. About
15,000 remained without power at early afternoon Friday, but crews
were working to restore it.
   ``We've got every available crew working, plus we've brought in
additional crews from neighboring utilities,'' said Johnson.
``We're doing everything possible to restore power, but it could
take some time before everyone's power is working.''
   Falling trees worsened weather-related problems in Richmond,
Ind., where Richmond Power & Light had 75 employees work through
the night to respond to 4,000 service calls between noon Thursday
and Friday morning.
   Public Service Indiana reported that about 8,000 residential
customers in central Indiana were still without power early Friday.
   ``The roads are passable, they're beginning to be drivable,''
said Indiana State Trooper Byron Westmoreland. ``But we're
watching. There are still some icy spots.''
   Teri Morris, a spokeswoman for the Springfield-based Central
Illinois Public Service Co., said there were ``widespread,
scattered outages'' Friday but had no estimate on the number of
affected customers. As many as 2,000 Illinois Power Co. customers
also lost power, utility spokesman Al Adams said. Most power was
restored by Friday afternoon.
   ``We've got ice building up on the power lines, ice building up
on trees and branches falling on the lines and we've got outages
reported from poles being knocked down by drivers on icy roads,''
said Barry Brandt of Columbus Southern Power Co. in Columbus, Ohio.
He said the number of customers affected was not immediately known.
   Fred Rosenbaum of Dayton Power and Light Co. estimated that
between 4,000 and 4,500 outages had been reported in his company's
western Ohio service area. W. Duane Zumbrunn of Ohio Power Co. said
``several thousand'' outages were reported in east-central Ohio,
and Ohio Edison spokesman Dave Osterland said several hundred
outages were reported in the Springfield and Marion areas.
   The storm also generated showers and thunderstorms from the
Tennessee Valley south along the Gulf Coast into Florida and the
southern Atlantic states early Friday, with heavy rain along the
Gulf of Mexico coast into the Florida panhandle.
   Some roads were flooded in southwestern Georgia, where small
streams were nearly full, the weather service said.
   By midmorning Friday, 24-hour rain amounts included 3.68 inches
at Tallahassee, Fla.; 3.09 inches at Valparaiso, Fla.; 3 inches at
Pensacola, Fla.; 2.97 inches at New Orleans; and 2.83 inches at
Dothan, Ala. In the six hours up to 7 a.m. EST, 1.87 inches fell at
Mary Esther, Fla.
   On Wednesday, the same storm system dumped up to 13 inches of
snow on parts of the Texas Panhandle and produced thunderstorms
that triggered flash floods in east Texas. A tornado ripped the
roofs off mobile homes near Galveston.
   In Louisiana, at least 35 planes were damaged or destroyed when
65 mph wind whipped across the Lafayette Regional Airport,
officials said Thursday.

   Contra rebels attacked a village in
northern Nicaragua and seized 13 people, including an American
volunteer for the Witness for Peace organization, group officials
said Friday.
   The Contras said the group was ``detained,'' not kidnapped.
   Edward Griffin, local director of the U.S.-based Witness for
Peace, said Richard Boren of Elkin, N.C., was abducted during the
attack Tuesday in the village of Mancotal, deep in the mountains of
Jinotega province.
   The village is about 75 miles north of Managua and is in an area
where rebels operate regularly in their war against the Sandinista
government.
   Four people defending the village and two Contras were killed in
the attack, a Defense Ministry comunique said.
   Gail Farris, U.S. southeast regional coordinator for Witness for
Peace, said 11 people were wounded in the attack.
   In Washington, Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the group
was ``detained'' by rebel forces who suspected them of being
foreign military collaborators working with the Sandinista
government.
   Matamoros said the 13 would be released as soon as a
``trustworthy'' Nicaraguan was found to return them to a safe
location.
   Witness for Peace sources said Boren, 30, had been in Nicaragua
since November, ``documenting Contra human rights abuses and
leading delegations to areas of conflict.''
   In October, Paul Fisher of Mill Valley, Calif., a Witness for
Peace volunteer, was kidnapped by the rebels and held for 14 days.
He was released unharmed.
   Benjamin Ernest Linder, 27, an American volunteer with another
organization, was killed in a Contra attack on another Jinotega
town last April.
   Generally, kidnapped civilians are held for a number of days by
the Contras and then released. Others escape, saying the rebels
tried to encourage them to join their fight.
   Dennis Marker, Witness for Peace's Washington director, said the
organization had contacted the U.S. State Department and the U.S.
Embassy in Managua about the abduction. The State Department had no
immediate confirmation.
   Witness for Peace describes itself as a ``politically
independent organization which opposes U.S. support for the war
against Nicaragua, while not taking sides on internal political
issues.''
   Marker said it has documented abuses by the Sandinistas and
Contras, although ``our experience in the last four years is that
the large majority of abuses are Contra abuses.''
   It maintains 32 volunteers in Nicaragua building schools and
working on other community projects in rural areas. The group also
sponsors tours to rural Nicaragua every two weeks for Americans
interested in the Contra issue.

   American arms negotiators in Geneva have
complained ``very forcefully'' to their Soviet counterparts that
Moscow has failed to submit three key documents, slowing progress
on a plan to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 50 percent, U.S.
officials said Friday.
   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department's deputy spokeswoman, said
the United States is still waiting for the Soviets to submit their
drafts of a memorandum of understanding and two protocols on
verification, which American negotiators have already provided.
   Both sides promised to submit the papers in time for a review by
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze at a meeting scheduled for March 22 in
Washington, she said.
   ``If the ministers are to have the opportunity to review these
key documents at their next meeting, it's clear and imperative that
the Soviets supply their versions as soon as possible,'' Mrs.
Oakley said.
   ``We've set no deadlines, but obviously these issues are
complicated and complex and they need time for thorough study and
review,'' she added.
   Another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said S.
Read Hanmer, the U.S. negotiator at the Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks in Geneva, ``very forcefully raised this issue with the
Soviets.''
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed
at their Dec. 8-10 summit to work diligently toward a 50 percent
reduction in long-range weapons carried by bombers and missiles on
land and sea. The aim was to get an agreement in time for signature
at a summit meeting in Moscow, which is expected to be held in May
or June.
   One of the most difficult elements of the negotiation has been
figuring out a way to insure that neither side cheated in its
conversion or elimination of the weapons.
   As in past arms negotiations, the two sides said they would
submit drafts of how they thought a verification system should be
written and then begin work to eliminate the differences.
   Since October, the United States has provided its versions of
two protocols: one on how the conversion or elimination would take
place, and one on how the procedures would be monitored and
inspected. On Wednesday, the United States submitted the final
document, a 130-page draft of a memorandum of understanding
providing an extensive exchange of factual material.
   ``The Soviets have not tabled (proposed) their versions, so
there's nothing to work with, and they won't convene working groups
until they have submitted their versions,'' a U.S. official said.
   In a speech in St. Louis on Thursday, Edward L. Rowny, an arms
control adviser to Reagan, said vast amounts of work need to be
done on a strategic agreement before it can be ready for Reagan and
Gorbachev to sign.
   Verification is among the toughest problems, he said.
   ``In START, because of the many different systems on both sides,
spanning a wide variety of geographic deployments and operational
practices, it is important that the details be tackled now and
solved soon,'' he said.
   U.S. officials conceded on Friday that the three documents they
submitted contain omissions, reflecting the need for more work just
to refine the American position on these issues.
   ``The difference is that we've made the submissions anyway, so
that at least we can start the process,'' one official said.

   More missiles flew at Baghdad and Tehran
on Friday in the long-range rocket duel between Iran and Iraq,
which has taken scores of lives in the five days since it began.
   Iran said 17 civilians, including four infants, were killed
Friday and Iraq said women and children were among the casualties
in Baghdad. Iraq has not given specific casualty figures since the
missile exchange began Monday.
   In Tehran, demonstrators marched on the Soviet Embassy chanting
``Death to Russia!'' Iran says the Soviet Union supplied the Iraqi
missiles, but the Soviets deny it.
   Police ringed the embassy in Tehran and the consulate in the
central city of Isfahan, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency said.
   Iraq said it fired three surface-to-surface missiles into Tehran
and the Iranians said they countered with two launched at Baghdad.
An Iraqi military communique confirmed one Iranian missile strike
on the capital.
   The attacks began early in the afternoon, breaking a 30-hour
lull in latest round in the ``war of the cities,'' which has killed
thousands of people since the war began in September 1980.
   In the five days, Iraq says it has hit Tehran with 27 missiles
and Qom, the Iranian hierarchy's holy city, with three. Iran says
it has fired 12 into Baghdad and Iraq has confirmed only nine.
   Iran has reported 47 people killed and more than 100 wounded in
Tehran, and no casualties in Qom. Iraq is not specific about
casualties, but speaks of many civilians killed or wounded.
   Although Iraq claims to have developed its own missiles, Western
military analysts believe they are Soviet-made Scud-B rockets with
strap-on boosters that enable them to reach Tehran and Qom, both
slightly less than 300 miles from the border. They say the probable
source is North Korea.
   Iran also uses Scud-Bs, supplied by its Arab allies Syria and
Libya, but does not need boosters because Baghdad is only 80 miles
from the frontier.
   A Iranian dispatch said a missile exploded in a ``densely
populated residential area'' of Tehran on Friday, destroying eight
houses and 20 cars.
   The official agency said 17 bodies were found under the debris
and 15 civilians were wounded. It reported several civilians
wounded in another missile attack.
   In a sermon at weekly Moslem prayers Friday, Ayatollah Mussavi
Ardebili, the chief justice, said Iran would stop the missiles if
Iraq did, but otherwise would ``retaliate severely by showering
missiles and artillery fire'' on Iraqi cities, IRNA reported.
   It said later that Iranian gunners fired two rockets at military
targets in Baghdad. Iraq said one reached the capital and hit a
residential area, killing or wounding civilians, including women
and children, and destroying houses and shops.
   ``The Iranian rulers should prepare themselves for further
devastating Iraqi rocket and air strikes by day and night,'' an
Iraqi military spokesman said, and the second Iraqi missile of the
day hit Tehran less than an hour later.
   Tehran radio claimed Iranian Revolutionary Guards fired
shorter-range missiles that destroyed a mobile Iraqi missile
platform at Tib, near the Iraqi city of Amarah in the central
sector of the 730-mile border warfront.
   The area is about 180 miles southeast of Baghdad and 340
southwest of Tehran.
   If the radio report is confirmed, it would be the first
indication of a lauching site for the Iraqi missiles. Iraq claims
they have a 400-mile range.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission indicated
Friday that the Tennessee Valley Authority may win permission

entire atomic power system was closed in 1985.
   The commission heard its staff present a generally glowing
report about TVA's readiness to reopen the Sequoyah Unit 2 plant
near Chattanooga, Tenn., after a month-long, non-nuclear heatup of
the facility.
   But ``I do not believe that Sequoyah is ready to go critical
yet,'' NRC Executive Director Victor Stello said. ``That may come
next week, or the following week.''
   The long-postponed restart of the Sequoyah plant would mark a
significant breakthrough for the TVA nuclear system in its long,
costly journey to recover from management and safety breakdowns
which branded it one of the worst in the history of atomic power.
   Its five operating reactors _ two at Sequoyah and three at
Browns Ferry near Athens, Ga. _ were ordered shut down in 1985,
plans for eight other plants were canceled, and construction on
four others was delayed for years.
   The commission heard a lengthy presentation from TVA's new
chairman, Marvin J. Runyon, and its nuclear chief, Steven A. White,
and found little to quarrel with about TVA's latest efforts to put
the program back on track.
   ``We truly are ready'' to resume the production of nuclear
power, White said. ``We will be cautious, we will be conservative,
we will be deliberate.''
   ``I did not want to apply industry standards to the TVA,'' White
said. ``I wanted to apply the highest standards, and that's what we
did.''
   Representatives of the NRC's special task force for the TVA
agreed that most problems confronting a Sequoyah restart have been
resolved, including major concerns about the durability of
rubber-insulated cables and the reliability of emergency diesel
generators, necessary for power in the event of a reactor accident.
   But Stewart Ebneter, who head the task force, said some concern
remains about allegations raised in January by a previous TVA
employee. After interviewing the man twice, Ebneter said, the NRC
staff is pursuing whether a fire hazard may be posed by the
possiblity of ``cable-to-cable shorts,'' a separate issue than the
earlier problem with the silicone-insulated cables.
   Ebneter said he expected to receive new technical data from the
TVA on the issue, and expressed hope it would be resolved before
the commission's next formal meeting, tentatively set for March 10
to consider a Sequoyah restart.
   The commission also is known to be reviewing findings of its
office of investigation over allegations that TVA's White
deliberately misled the commission about safety conditions at
Sequoyah in a January 1986 document.
   The case was referred to the Justice Department late last year,
but no mention was made of the investigation during Friday's
session.
   In fact, NRC Chairman Lando Zech was effusive in his praise of
White and told the TVA's board of directors that ``I hope you will
continue your support for Steve White.''

<HEAD>Waldheim Controversy Triggers Resignation Of General</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of Austria's five generals announced
Friday he was resigning because of a disagreement involving
President Kurt Waldheim and his service in the Nazi army during
World War II.
   Gen. Karl Schaffer said he asked to resign last month to protest
a directive from Defense Minister Robert Lichal, who ordered the
general not to edit an army film used for political education.
   Schaffer wanted to cut out a segment in the film that quoted a
historian as saying: ``Historians are no apostles of morals.''
   He said he wanted to do so to avoid a potential association with
a recent report by an international historians' commission that
questioned Waldheim's moral integrity during his service as a
lieutenant in the German army. The commission also said Waldheim
was in ``close proximity'' to wartime atrocities.
   But Lichal, a conservative backer of Waldheim, decreed the
segment must remain in the film.
   Schaffer, who is director of the prestigious national defense
academy, told The Associated Press he had tried to keep the dispute
over Waldheim out of the army.
   But since it had proved impossible, Schaffer said he was
resorting to the ``last means available to an officer'' and asking
for early retirement.
   Under the Austrian constitution, Waldheim is commander-in-chief
of the federal army.
   Word that the 58-year-old general was stepping down from the
officers' training academy drew calls from the Socialist Party and
the small Freedom Party for Lichal to back down.
   ``Party bickering over the president'' should be kept out of the
army, the Socialist and Freedom parties said.
   Soon after the historians' report was released Feb. 9, Socialist
officers in the army issued a statement calling on Waldheim to
resign.
   The defense minister told a news conference Friday that Schaffer
had asked to retire for health reasons, and rejected all other
suggestions about the general's departure.
   The Neue Arbeiterzeitung said several unidentified officers had
declared their solidarity with Schaffer and one brigadier _ one of
the 90 most senior army commanders _ had returned his membership
card to the conservative People's Party.

   Two men were arrested and a third was being
questioned Friday in the slaying of a rookie cop who was shot three
times in the head as he guarded a witness in a drug case, police
said.
   Todd Scott and Scott Cobb were charged with second-degree murder
and criminal possession of a weapon after their arrests late
Thursday, according to police. A third suspect surrendered Friday
and was being questioned, Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward said at
a news conference.
   Officer Edward Byrne, 22, was shot early Feb. 26 while sitting
in a patrol car, guarding the house of a man who had complained to
police about crack dealers in the South Jamaica neighborhood of
Queens.
   The killing outraged Mayor Edward Koch, who called President
Reagan a ``wimp'' in the war on drugs; prompted a roundup of 294
suspected drug dealers and focused new attention on the city's drug
lords.
   A reward fund grew to $130,000 Thursday with a $25,000
contribution from some members of the New York Stock Exchange.
   City newspapers, quoting unidentified sources, said Scott
allegedly works for Howard ``Pappy'' Mason, an associate of reputed
drug kingpin Lorenzo ``Fat Cat'' Nichols.
   Nichols, 29, was sentenced Feb. 25 in Queens to 25 years to life
in prison on drug and gun charges and is awaiting trial on charges
he had his parole officer killed for revenge. Mason is awaiting
trial on charges he was one of the people who carried out that
killing.
   Police have speculated that Nichols may have ordered Byrne's
killing as retribution for his long sentence.
   New York Newsday reported Friday that the killing was planned
Feb. 24. The newspaper quoted police sources as saying that two men
were approached by men from a nearby housing project and offered
$10,000 to ``hit a cop.''
   ``This is from the Fat Cat,'' the men said, according to the
Newsday source, and the two drew straws to decide who would pull
the trigger.
   An unidentified detective on the case told Newsday that the
killers twice went past the guarded house and ``each time they saw
a black officer and they didn't kill.''
   ``They also passed by when a woman sat guard. They were waiting
for a cop like Edward Byrne,'' who was white, the detective daid.
   However, Ward said Friday, ``I don't think there was anything
racial about the assassination of Officer Eddie Byrne.''
   ``Officer Edward Byrne was killed because he wore a blue
uniform,'' said Ward.
   The Rev. Thomas DeVita, who presided at Byrne's funeral Monday,
said family members told him they plan to go to the home of the
witness Byrne was guarding to ``offer moral support.''
   ``I think I echo the feelings of others too, that justice should
be done,'' said De Vita.
   ``The community has been very helpful,'' Ward said Thursday,
adding he hoped the drug dealers learned a lesson.
   ``Shooting at cops, it's just bad for business. I think
experienced criminals know that; perhaps these inexperienced ones
will learn it,'' the commissioner said.

   Authorities are searching for a band of
crooks who broke into the First Jersey National Bank and stole
non-dairy creamer and mouthwash.
   And sugar. And coffee _ regular and decaf. And soda.
   The loot was valued at roughly $260.
   Police Sgt. Robert Orlowski said Friday that the bank was robbed
sometime late Monday or early Tuesday. The outlaws kicked in
several inner doors and made their way to the employees' supply
cabinet.
   When the thiefs departed, the bank was out 12 five-pound bags of
sugar, 24 boxes of tea, six cans of decaffeinated coffee, 12 cans
of regular coffee, 16 bottles of dish detergent, nine boxes of
non-dairy creamer, three bottles of mouthwash and three cases of
soda.
   Orlowski said there was no evidence the bandits even tried to
get to the vault.
   ``They must be big coffee drinkers. But I don't know what
they're going to do with 16 bottles of dish detergent,'' said
Orlowski.

   Police deployed a dozen patrol
cars and a helicopter in a late-night chase for a craft from outer
space, a police spokesman said Friday.
   The hunt, accompanied by dozens of calls from all over the Dutch
capital reporting unidentified flying objects, failed to yield
anything extra-terrestrial, according to spokesman Klaas Wilting.
   ``We were alerted late Thursday night by Schiphol (airport) air
traffic controllers who observed bright lights in a stationary
position over the port area which didn't show up on their radar
screens,'' Wilting said.
   After a radio newscast had mentioned the Schiphol sighting,
calls started pouring in from all over the city, describing objects
ranging from ``airplane-like things to fantastic contraptions with
Darth Vader at the helm,'' said Wilting.
   Around midnight, 12 patrol cars and a police helicopter were
involved, Wilting said.
   After several hours, ``we found nothing except some strong lamps
on top of a 50-meter (150-foot) high crane in the harbor,'' which
might have been visible from the airport's control tower, Wilting
said.
   ``We think it was a classic example of popular delusion, coupled
with a number of jokers trying to pull a trick on us,'' the
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   The Duke and Duchess of York's 10-day dash
through California headed for the home stretch Friday as the royal
couple met Los Angeles' duke of oil and prepared to visit a UCLA
film class and a sculpture made of 600 Barbie and Ken dolls.
   The visit with Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand
Hammer, 89, kicked off the eighth day of a whirlwind tour by Prince
Andrew and his pregnant, red-haired wife, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   ``Hi, Fergie!'' two dozen spectators chanted as Sarah emerged
from a Rolls-Royce limousine clad in a navy-blue suit, a brimless
rust-colored hat and brown shoes. Andrew, in a dark business suit,
and his wife waved politely to the small crowd.
   Hammer escorted the couple into his Wilshire Boulevard corporate
headquarters for talks over coffee and rolls. Mayor Tom Bradley
showed up for the last 10 minutes of the meeting.
   As Hammer and Bradley escorted Andrew and Sarah back to their
car, a teen-age girl gave Sarah a bouquet and spectators yelled,
``It's wonderful seeing you'' and ``Come back again!''
   ``It's amazing,'' said British-born spectator Elaine Ball, who
has lived in Los Angeles for five years. ``You never see the royal
family over there, but you come 6,000 miles and you can see them.''
   The duke and duchess sped to the nearby University of
California, Los Angeles, where they were greeted by Chancellor
Charles Young, his wife and a crowd of 200 students _ some yelling
``Sarah! Sarah!'' _ then swiftly escorted to a luncheon with more
than 100 students.
   ``Sarah's so pretty,'' said student Rachel Perse, 19.
   ``Andy looked good, too!'' added 20-year-old Roberta Salazar.
   The royal itinerary at UCLA included a stop to view sculptures
of the Barbie and Ken dolls and UCLA's Bruin Bear mascot; a gift to
Andrew and Sarah of historical newsreel footage of the royal
family; visits to a film-making class and the Jules Stein Eye
Institute; and a walk across the Center for Health Sciences Plaza.
   The sculpture of Barbie and Ken dolls, entitled ``Off the Beaten
Track,'' was created by 31-year-old Scottish-born artist David
Mach. His work, on view through March 13 outside a UCLA art
gallery, consists of a two-ton, 20-by-10-foot cargo bin that
appears to be supported by the 600 dolls, their arms outstretched
above them.
   Mach's sculpture, which purportedly satirizes consumerism, is on
display as part of ``UK@LA '88: A Celebration of British Arts,''
which Andrew and Sarah are promoting on their visit.
   After leaving UCLA by helicopter, the duke and duchess were due
in Palm Springs to open a department store boutique Saturday
morning. Then they will travel to the Eldorado Polo Club in nearby
Indio to attend a polo match to benefit efforts to rebuild
Shakespeare's Globe Theater on its original site on the banks of
the Thames River.
   Sarah's father, Major Ronald Ferguson, will be captain of the
Windsor Park team in the polo match.
   On Sunday, the royal couple are scheduled to travel from Palm
Springs to Los Angeles for a flight back to London.

   A collection of 120 prints of plant drawings made
on Capt. James Cook's first voyage around the world was auctioned
in the Natural History Museum.
   Collectors gathered Thursday night in the front hall around the
feet of a skeleton of Diplodocus, a plant-eating dinosaur that
lived 150 million years ago.
   Sotheby's, which conducted the sale, said the prints fetched
$94,441.
   The plants were drawn by Sydney Parkinson, who sailed with Cook
and Sir Joseph Banks on a 1768-71 journey that included Australia,
New Zealand, Java, Argentina and Brazil.
   None of the buyers was identified. The top price was $2,816 for
a print of a portia tree.

<HEAD>South Carolina Primary: Preview of the South?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The four Republican presidential
candidates focused on South Carolina Friday, searching for support
in the waning hours before a Saturday primary described by
front-runner George Bush as an ``all-important Super Tuesday
preview.''
   In the hours before the polls opened Saturday morning, the vice
president said he was concerned that his lead in opinion polls
might cause complacency by his supporters.
   Pat Robertson answered questions for two hours on a radio
call-in show, after complaining during a 30-minute television ad
Thursday night of ``an effort to discredit me with anti-South,
anti-Christian bias.'' He paid $75,000 for the ad.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole campaigned with Sen. Strom Thurmond and
former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick at his side.
   Rep. Jack Kemp scheduled appearances in three major cities _
Greenville, Columbia and Charleston.
   All the GOP candidates believe the South Carolina primary on
Saturday will offer a preview of how the South is likely to vote
three days later when 14 Southern and border states hold primaries
or caucuses.
   ``This all-important Super Tuesday preview,'' was how Bush
described the Saturday vote during an appearance before Realtors in
Columbia. ``That message from South Carolina is going to shape
events on Super Tuesday nd Super Tuesday is going to guarantee, in
my view, whoever wins the nomination of the Republican Party.''
   Later, in Beaufort, he told reporters he was concerned about
complacency. Polls indicate a sizeable lead for the vice president
here and elsewhere in the South.
   ``One of the reason we're driving down to the wire with the
intensity that we are is exactly that. I cannot relax or neglect
South Carolina because things look fairly strong,'' he said.
   Former television evangelist Robertson used his paid broadcast
Thursday to try an reassure voters about his views of the
separation of church and state.
   ``I believe absolutely in the separation of church and state and
I do not believe that the president of the United States should be
subject to the orders or authority of any specific religious
body,'' he said.
   The Robertson ad was reminiscent of a tactic used successfully
in North Carolina in 1976 when supporters of Ronald Reagan bought
television time to broadcast a speech by their candidate in his
race against President Gerald R. Ford.
   That ad, in which Reagan raised the issue of the Panama Canal
treaty, was credited with giving the then-governor of California
his first primary victory over the incumbent president.
   In personal appearances and in ads, Kemp was vowing not to turn
the canal over to Panama if strongman Manuel Noriega was still in
power.
   ``There is absolutely no way this country could allow that
international waterway to fall into the hands of a dictator like
Noriega, a drug smuggler like Noriega,'' said Kemp.

<HEAD>Carlucci Opposes Use of Troops as Drug Law-Enforcers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said
Friday he would strongly oppose any effort to carve out an active
law-enforcement role for the military in the war on drugs.
   ``That is not the function of the military. We are not the
front-line agency in the war on drugs,'' Carlucci said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   Espousing the same approach as his predecessor, Caspar W.
Weinberger, Carlucci said he was ``very much against giving the
military arrest authority or getting them into law enforcement''
and did not foresee any change in administration policy.
   Carlucci also called Libyan strongman Col. Moammar Gadhafi a
``flyspeck'' who wasn't worth listening to and said he thought the
U.S. naval force in the Persian Gulf had been reduced to a proper
level
   He predicted that a Soviet pullout from Afghanistan, if it
occurs, would have little effect on the Kremlin's policies and its
support of countries such as Nicaragua.
   Carlucci also expressed hope that a meeting later this month
with his Soviet counterpart, Dmitri Yazov, would at the least
produce an agreement on steps to avoid small, but dangerous,
confrontations such a recent ship-bumping incident in the Black Sea
and interference with U.S. military observers in East Germany.
   Carlucci, who assumed his post in November after Weinberger
retired, was asked his views on drug enforcement after Education
Secretary William Bennett suggested the United States consider ``a
broader use of military force against both the production and
shipment of drugs.''
   Sen. Bob Dole, who is seeking the Republican presidential
nomination, adopted the same approach on Thursday, calling for use
of ``the full force of our military ...''
   The defense secretary countered the Pentagon should continue to
play only a supporting role in the war on drugs _ sharing equipment
and intelligence _ because otherwise it would lose sight of its
real mission.
   ``My own view is that ... the military should be supportive,''
he said. ``But I would be very much against giving the military
arrest authority or getting them into law enforcement.''
   Carlucci reserved his most pointed rhetoric for Libya's Gadhafi,
who earlier this week demanded once again the United States
recognize his claim to the Gulf of Sidra, off the Mediterranean Sea.
   The United States recognizes only the standard 12-mile
territorial limit in the gulf. U.S. and Libyan forces clashed in
March 1986 after the Navy ignored Gadhafi's ``line of death'' in
the gulf and a month later, U.S. jets bombed Libya in retaliation
for Libya's alleged involvement in international terrorism.
   ``I think Gadhafi's a flyspeck,'' Carlucci said. ``I don't think
he's worth paying attention to. We're certainly not dancing to his
tune.''
   Carlucci refused to say whether the United States was planning
any additional naval maneuvers in the gulf, but added: ``If your
question is, are we going ahead with the freedom of navigation
program, yeah, we're going ahead with that program around the world
based on our schedule ....''
   The defense secretary said he was satisfied with the state of
U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, where American ships have been
protecting reflagged Kuwaiti tankers against Iranian attack since
last July. The Navy fleet was recently reduced in size, with a
battleship and helicopter carrier sailing for home.
   ``We are now on our 39th convoy, 38 of which have been without
incident,'' Carlucci said. ``And I think that record speaks for
itself. We've obviously got the capability over there that we
need.''
   Turning to his March 14 meeting with Yazov in Bern, Switzerland
_ the first such working session between the U.S. and Soviet
defense chiefs _ Carlucci predicted the talks would focus on
avoiding ``dangerous activities,'' or confrontations between small
military units; arms control and human rights; Soviet defense
doctrine, and planning for meetings of top-ranking military
officers.
   ``In the area of what we call dangerous activities, I would hope
that we can reach some meeting of the minds ... at least set up a
process so that they can be avoided,'' Carlucci said.
   The Soviets, he added, are unlikely to change any of their
military policies as a result of their setbacks in Afghanistan,
where they are fighting U.S.-supported rebels.
   ``I guess people have in mind the Vietnam analogy,'' Carlucci
said. ``I don't think it works the same way in their system ... the
Soviet military and the Soviet people don't have access to the same
amount of information that we have in our society.''
   Asked about the huge military buildup during President Reagan's
first term, when he was Weinberger's deputy, Carlucci said he
wouldn't second-guess the pace or manner in which those increases
were pursued.
   While political support for the buildup has evaporated _ forcing
budget cuts for three years running _ ``we could have well have
ended up with less'' if the spending hikes had been sought on a
more gradual basis, he said.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said
Friday he has given Israel and three Arab countries an
``ambitious'' U.S. proposal for Middle East peace talks and
requested a response within 10 days.
   Under the plan, Israel would negotiate with a joint delegation
of Jordanians and Palestinians over the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Israel also would negotiate with Syria over the Golan
Heights.
   Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war.
Part of it was returned to Syria under a 1974 military
disengagement agreement, and in December 1981, Israel annexed the
portion remaining in its hands.
   Shultz said both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were willing to negotiate over the
territory.
   Egypt was the third Arab country to get the U.S. proposal from
Shultz, but it would not be involved directly in negotiations.
Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, and except for the
small enclave Taba, they have no territorial disputes.
   ``There is an attitude of a readiness to work to change things
that should be taken advantage of by everybody,'' Shultz said.
``The moment can be lost.''
   He cast the U.S. proposal for talks on an overall settlement of
the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute in the form of identical letters
to King Hussein of Jordan and to Shamir, with a copy to Peres.
Other versions were submitted to President Hafez Assad of Syria and
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   In Damascus, Syrian presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh said
after the 2{-hour meeting that Shultz handed Assad ``a written
message from President Ronald Reagan, containing the American
proposal for a comprehensive settlement in the region.''
   ``Shultz explained the contents of the letter to President Assad
and during their discussion, President Assad expressed several
remarks on the letter,'' Kourieh added.
   After the meeting at the downtown Muhajerine Presidential
Palace, Shultz left for the aiport and took off for Cairo at 7:30
p.m. Shultz was expected back in Washington early Saturaday.
   Earlier a U.S. official said Shamir and Hussein had not
commented on the letter.
   Shultz ``did not get a yes or no from either of them,'' the
official said as Shultz stopped in Damascus for talks with Assad.
   The proposal calls for negotiations to open in early April to
provide some self-rule for 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   Negotiations for an overall Middle East settlement would be held
by December.
   The occupied territories have been marked by violence for nearly
three months, and scores of Palestinians have died in clashes with
Israeli troops.
   Shamir is expected to give his response to the U.S. proposals
when he visits Washington on March 14-16 for talks with President
Reagan and Shultz.
   Hussein, who has denounced the Reagan adminstration as
hopelessly one-sided toward Israel, has kept away from Washington.
Jordan's response is expected to go through diplomatic channels.
   ``We believe that things have begun to move,'' Peres said as he
saw Shultz off for Damascus.
   ``Not that everything that was difficult disappeared,'' he added.
   The foreign minister has been far more inclined to accept
Shultz's plan than Shamir. The prime minister objects among other
things to the U.S. concept of Israel trading land in exchange for
Arab acceptance of Israel's right to exist.
   Shultz met separately with Shamir and Peres, the two main forces
in a divided Israeli government.
   Hussein, meanwhile, has sought to gain a seat at the peace table
for the Palestine Liberation Organization, which the United States
and Israel brand a terrorist group.
   Police on Friday discovered a car bomb set on a street about 300
yards from the Hilton Hotel in Jerusalem where Shultz was staying
and safely dismantled the explosives.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization released a statement in
west Beirut claiming responsibility for the bomb and said Shultz
was the target.
   Police said the intent may have been to carry out an attack in a
commercial center of Jerusalem to protest Shultz's visit.
   No arrests were reported.

   The Navy awarded a Jamaican-born jet engine
mechanic $27,500 on Friday for suggesting a repair procedure that
is now saving the government $11 million a year.
   Winston Edwards, 34, received the check and a commendation
signed by President Reagan during ceremonies hosted by Vice Adm.
Joseph B. Wilkenson Jr., the head of the Naval Air Systems Command.
   Edwards, a civilian mechanic at the Alameda Naval Aviation Depot
in California, previously had received $7,500 under the Beneficial
Suggestion Awards Program for prodding his local depot and the
command to make the change in repair and overhaul procedures.
   The additional money presented Friday recognizes the high annual
savings now accruing to the government since Edwards' suggestion
was applied throughout the military system.
   The combined award of $35,000 is ``the highest cash award that
can be given to a civilian employees under the Beneficial
Suggestion Awards Program,'' the Navy said.
   Edwards, who left Jamaica at the age of 11, works as a jet
engine repairman at the Alameda depot. His campaign to save money
began when he suggested to his superiors that instead of just
throwing out combustion engine liners during overhauls of TF-34
engines, the Navy could take two bad liners and fashion one good
one.
   The TF-34 engine is used to power the Navy's S-3 Viking
sub-hunting plane and the Air Force's A-10 Thunderbolt
ground-attack jet. Each engine liner costs about $18,660 new. The
Alameda depot overhauls about 500 TF-34 engines every year.
   Edwards originally suggested the change in overhaul procedures
in 1981 after a day at work during which he threw away 10 of the
liners. The Navy wasn't that impressed, however, and turned down
the idea.
   Edwards persisted, however, and in 1985 the Navy decided to give
it a try.
   According to the service, each of the combustion engine liners
has 18 swirlers _ parts that mix and atomize the fuel and air
needed for combustion. Under the old practice, if any of the
swirlers inside a liner were cracked when the engine came in for
overhaul, the entire combustion liner was simply replaced.
   Using Edwards' suggestion, the Navy and Air Force now salvage
enough good swirlers from two bad liners to combine them into one
good spare.

   George Harrison scoffs at reports that he and
fellow former Beatle Paul McCartney are having a tiff, saying
instead they are considering a reunion with Ringo Starr to ``write
a tune and play together.''
   During a recording Thursday for a television talk show,
Harrison, 45, denied a recent British press report of a rift with
McCartney.
   ``Maybe we will write a tune and play together. It won't be The
Beatles, of course, but it may happen and we are getting on with
Paul much better than we used to,'' Harrison said during the
recording for the ``Aspel and Company'' show.
   The British tabloid News of the World last Sunday reported that
``a bitter feud'' had erupted between Harrison and McCartney over a
recent pop music festival at San Remo in Italy.
   But Harrison countered: ``For the last 10 years I did not see
much of Paul at all. But recently we have been going out to dinner
and seeing each other socially quite a lot.''
   John Lennon, the fourth member of The Beatles, was shot dead
outside his New York apartment on Dec. 8, 1980.

   The executive producer of Ironweed said the
movie almost went to the dogs when a pack of angry canines supposed
to be attacking another actor turned on Jack Nicholson.
   ``Normally, we do five or six takes... by the time we did the
fifth take, the dogs were starting to bite Jack,'' producer Denis
Blouin said recently.
   ``Nicholson was getting fed up. He said he was finished, he was
furious and said he was going home. It took us an hour to convince
him to come back. Then, after 15 takes, we finally got the scene
finished,'' he said.
   In the film Ironweed, Nicholson stars as Francis Phelan, a
former baseball star who returns to his hometown as a bum. His
co-star, Meryl Streep, is Helen Archer, an educated woman who
clings to her friendship with Francis.

   A $4 million restaurant and ``boutique''
brewery proposed by chef Wolfgang Puck met with dis-flavor when a
City Council committee recommended rejecting the plan.
   At a hearing before the three-member Planning and Environment
Committee this week, residents said the brewery and restaurant
would bring drunken drivers, traffic and noise to their
neighborhood on the city's Westside.
   City Council members Ruth Galanter and Michael Woo agreed, but
Councilman Hal Bernson, the committee chairman, withheld his vote
until he could visit the site.
   In a telephone interview at Spago's, Puck's West Hollywood
restaurant, the chef said he would not push the project against
strong local opposition.
   ``I want it to be a neighborhood restaurant,'' Puck said. ``If
the neighborhood doesn't want it, I don't want to spend years
fighting them.''
   Puck envisions building what he called a ``boutique,'' or
``micro brewery'' that would produce a quality beer.

<HEAD>Chambers Jury Visits Central Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 21-year-old defendant in what has been
dubbed the ``preppie murder'' trial peered through trees on a damp,
gray Friday morning as the jurors in his case tramped over the
Central Park ground where he left a young woman dead.
   Robert Chambers, 21, charged with second-degree murder in the
death of Jennifer Levin, sat in the back of a gray car about 40
yards from where her bruised, nearly naked body was found Aug. 26,
1986.
   It was a different vantage point from the low wall behind the
Metropolitan Museum of Art where he sat as police investigated the
death shortly after Miss Levin's body was discovered by a passing
bicyclist. Chambers admits killing her but says it was an accident
after she attacked him sexually and hurt him.
   The cold, damp ground around the tree where the body was found
was bare, and the tree was stripped of leaves, a contrast to the
green grass and foliage in the park on the warm summer morning when
Miss Levin was killed.
   The jurors walked over to examine the areas where the victim's
body and panties were found and where several police officers
testified they had seen a ground disturbance suggesting a body had
been dragged.
   Fifty reporters and photographers and a few onlookers watched
the proceeding from a distance, kept away by a yellow police ribbon.
   The trip came a day after a prosecutor testified he was not
trying to trick Chambers by saying police had not found Miss
Levin's underpants in the park when in fact they had.
   In a videotaped interview, Assistant District Attorney Stephen
Saracco is heard telling Chambers that his account of how he killed
Miss Levin does not make sense in part because no panties were
found.
   Chambers' lawyer, Jack Litman, has suggested that Saracco tried
to trick his client by lying to him.
   Chambers and Miss Levin, 18, went to the park after meeting in
an East Side bar frequented by children of privilege. Both had
attended prep schools; Miss Levin was college-bound while Chambers
was a college dropout.
   Chambers says the young woman tied his hands behind his back
with her panties, sat on his chest facing his feet and grabbed his
genitals painfully. He says he freed his hands, threw the panties
over his head and reached up with his left forearm and yanked
against her throat, flipping her off him.
   Detective Michael Sheehan testified early in the 9-week-old
trial that another investigator passed Saracco a note during the
videotaping to tell him the panties were found. He said they were
recovered some 45 feet from the body.
   ``Do you remember a note being put in front of you?'' defense
lawyer Jack Litman asked Saracco.
   ``I don't recall a note _ if there was one,'' Saracco said. ``I
don't know if there was a note.''

had no suspects.

or thieves cut a padlock to a storage area at mid-week and took
enough syrup to make more than 19,000 sundaes.
   McBride said the syrup, valued at $2,400, was apparently all the
intruders wanted.
   Police have notified authorities across the state that someone
may try to sell the stolen syrup.

   The PLO claimed responsibility for a car packed
with explosives that was found near a hotel where Secretary of
State George P. Shultz was staying. The guerrilla group said Shultz
was the target.
   Police, who defused the bomb safely, said the car had been found
accidentally after it was abandoned by its driver. There were no
reports of arrests.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said the bomb was well off the route
the secretary took from the hotel to Israeli government offices.
   But Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestinian guerrilla group,
Fatah, said in a statement in Beirut that ``the driver had an
accident and the car crashed into a power pole about 30 minutes
before the time set for the bomb to explode.''
   ``The driver deserted the vehicle and managed to escape,'' the
communique said.
   In a communique telephoned to The Associated Press office in
west Beirut, Fatah said its military command ``instructed the
Limassol martyrs group to park a bomb-laden car in front of the
Hilton Hotel in Jerusalem targeting Shultz, the messenger of
imperial'' Yehudai said. ``Later
the chief police explosives expert passed by and through his own
experience decided the car was indeed suspicious ... We found it
was a car bomb.''
   The car carried Israeli license plates with a sticker reading:
``Contribute to security.''
   Israel Television quoted police officials as saying the car was
sold ``to an Arab who apparently used a fake identity (card).''
   The car was found less than a quarter-mile from the hotel, where
Shultz spent Thursday night.
   Three officials of Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
were killed in a car bomb explosion in the Cypriot port of Limassol
Feb. 14.
   The PLO blamed Israel's Mossad secret service for the bombing.
   It said the attack was meant to be ``a response to the Zionists'
brutality against our people in the occupied territories.''
   ``We warn Shultz and all agents of imperialism against reaching
out for the PLO, the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people,'' the communique added.
   It was the second report of a car bomb in two days. On Thursday,
one exploded outside the bus station of Kfar Saba, a town in
central Israel, causing no injuries.

   The best-liked commercials of 1987 included some
starring performances from animated characters such as dancing clay
raisins, a hamburger chain's moonman and a pizza company's dreaded
spoiler called a Noid.
   Few of the commercials mentioned most often by consumers polled
by Video Storyboard Tests Inc. featured traditional show business
celebrities, the head of the consumer research firm said Thursday.
   ``We seem to heading into a period when we see more created
celebrities, not necessarily human beings, in commercials,'' said
David Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard, in relasing the
results of the firm's 10th annual survey of more than 25,000 people.
   Leading the list was the campaign for California raisins, which
used clay models of raisins dancing to the sounds of Motown music.
The ads cost a relatively modest $5.4 million, compared to as much
as $344 million for McDonald's Corp. commercials.
   Second was Bud Light beer commercials, many of which featured
the English bull terrier Spuds MacKenzie while others offered
numerous variations of what can go wrong if you simply order a
``light'' without specifying the brand.
   The ad campaign for Pepsi soft drinks placed third, and Miller
Lite beer commercials were fourth. Ads for McDonald's restaurants
came in fifth.
   The Noid, the animated imp with the maniacal laugh who threatens
the freshness of home-delivered pizza in Domino's Pizza
commercials, was foiled again and wound up 10th.

   One job title is just like any other _ or is it?
   How about ``terminal operator'' for mortician, or ``mobile
sanitatian engineer'' for garbage truck driver. Or ``vice
president, participation and residuals,'' the person in charge of
royalties?
   These are some of the titles personnel executives from about 100
companies reported in a survey by Personnel Journal, based in Costa
Mesa, Calif., which didn't identify any of the people or companies
it quoted.
   Whether humorous or obscure, job titles do serve a purpose,
personnel managers insist.
   ``Titles are accepted as a form of recognition and motivation,''
said an unidentified personnel manager of a Chicago-based
association management firm. ``They give the feeling of function
and stature.''
   ``People need structure and organization to provide a sense of
stability and belonging _ where do they fit in the organization?
Titles help them,'' says a personnel executive at a federal
hospital in Milwaukee.
   There are some negatives to titles, the personnel managers admit.
   ``They create a class distinction and enhance the we-versus-them
attitude,'' said an executive of a mining company in Missoula, Mont.

   The ranking Republican on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee on Friday called for a protest to the Soviet
Union, while the State Department sought to minimize the
significance of its statement on microwave beams aimed at the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow.
   Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan said Secretary of State
George P. Shultz should lodge an official protest over the
continuing presence of low-level microwave beams aimed at the
embassy.
   ``How can we trust the Soviets to honor sensitive arms reduction
agreements if they are technically attacking our embassy
building?'' Broomfield said. ``Trust is an essential part of
improving relations with the U.S.S.R. Harassing our diplomats there
is unacceptable.''
   He added: ``I want the State Department to play hardball this
time and protest this clear abuse of our fellow citizens'' serving
in Moscow.
   In a statement released Thursday in response to questions
submitted by The Associated Press, the State Department's Bureau of
Diplomatic Security said ``microwave signals in the 5-11 GHz
(gigahertz) range continue to be detected at the Moscow embassy
chancery.''
   ``The microwave signal power levels are typically 0.1 microwatt
per square centimeter external to the building,'' it said.
``Measurements internal to the building are typically less than
0.01 microwatt per square centimeter.''
   The current U.S. voluntary safety standard for exposure to
microwave radiation _ set by the American National Standards
Institute _ is 5,000 microwatts per square centimeter. By contrast,
the Soviet Union's official safety standard for the microwave
frequency range is much lower _ 10 microwatts per square centimeter.
   The statement Thursday said the department could shed no light
as to why microwaves have been aimed against the embassy for
perhaps as far back as October 1953. It said ``any response would
be speculation.''
   At a news briefing Friday, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley emphasized the low power levels of the Soviet signals
currently being detected at the embassy and denied that the
situation amounts to ``bombardment.''
   ``The Soviets have not resumed microwave bombardment,'' she
said. ``We have routinely detected some very low-level microwave
activity in our ongoing continuous microwave screening at the
embassy. ... There are no known risks from the type of low levels
of exposure in Moscow that have continued.
   ``We are, of course, concerned about this situation,'' Mrs.
Oakley continued. ``In the past, we've protested when levels have
exceeded those we consider safe. We're prepared to do so again,
should we determine that they pose any threat whatsoever to our
staff, however remote.''
   She added: ``What we're saying is that there is not a new
program of bombardment. We have watched the situation carefully. We
continue to watch it carefully. There have been low levels that we
have detected, but these pose no risk.''

   The State Department has denied a visa to
Gerry Adams, head of the Irish Republican Army's legal political
wing, based on the belief that he is involved in terrorist
activity, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
   ``He was ineligible under (the section) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act which excludes from admission to the U.S. people
who are personally involved with terrorist activities,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Donna Sherman.
   Asked to specify the activities, Sherman said: ``Our information
is that as president of the provisional Sinn Fein, Mr. Adams is
personally and publicly committed to and abets the armed struggle
in Northern Ireland, and it's on that basis he was denied a visa.''
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
is outlawed on both sides of the border, although Sinn Fein is
legal.
   Adams had said on his application that he wished to travel to
the United States for ``political work,'' Sherman said.
   Martin Galvin, a spokesman for the Irish Northern Aid Committee,
said in a mailgram to The Associated Press that his group was
``outraged'' by the State Department's action, and blamed it on
pressure from Britain.
   ``We regard the continuing denial of a visa to Mr. Adams as
censorship by visa denial,'' Galvin wrote.
   The committee, also known as Noraid, charged that the State
Department was refusing ``to comply with the spirit and letter of
the new visa provisions.''
   Noraid claims to aid the victims of strife between Protestants
and Roman Catholics, but the U.S., Irish and British governments

   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., and Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
introduced an amendment last year which overturned that portion of
the McCarran Walter Act which had allowed the U.S. government to
deny visas to aliens who participate in political activities in
their native countries which would be legal for U.S. citizens in
the United States.
   However, Sherman said Adams was denied a visa based on another
part of the law that, she said, ``explicitly preserves the
authority of the executive branch to deny a visa to someone who is
involved in terrorist activity.''
   This was at least the third time that Adams, who is also a
member of British Parliament, has been denied a visa to the United
States. Earlier rebuffs occurred in June 1986 and February 1985,
Sherman said.
   In July 1986, Canada denied Adams entry because he had been
convicted of attempting to escape from prison in 1974 after being
held for two years under emergency powers.
   Adams had been trying to reach Canada after being denied a U.S.
visa to address a conference of Irish-Americans in Buffalo, N.Y.

   Police officers from Fairfax, Calif.,
weren't libeled by an X-rated film in which actors wore the
department's uniforms, a state appeals court ruled Thursday.
   Ten past or present Fairfax officers, including a policewoman,
had sued the filmmaker, distributor and a magazine that had carried
a publicity photo from the film for libel, invasion of privacy and
emotional distress. They sought $240 million.
   But the appeals court, upholding a lower-court decision, said in
a 3-0 ruling that there was no intent to portray actual Fairfax
police officers and no danger that the public would confuse the
actors with the real officers.
   The film, ``Nightlife,'' made in 1983 by a now-defunct
filmmaker, included a segment in which two policemen agree not to
arrest two prostitutes in exchange for sex.
   Actors wore surplus Fairfax, Calif., police uniforms from a
costume store in San Francisco, the appeals court said.
   The film did not identify the location of Fairfax at a time when
there were at least six Fairfax police departments in various
states, the court said.
   The court also noted that between 90 and 105 people had been
authorized to wear the shoulder patch of the Fairfax, Calif.,
police.

   The House has killed its Democratic

Central America once again in limbo and the rebels without support.
   The lawmakers voted 216-208 Thursday to reject the Democrats'

of food, clothing and medical supplies to the rebels and created a
new $14 million program to aid children who are victims of the
Nicaraguan civil war.
   Forty-five Democrats, mostly liberals who oppose any aid to the
Contras, joined with Republicans, who thought the aid proposal too
weak, to deal it a fatal blow. Only five of 176 GOP members present

   Ten years after the federal government forced a
change in the stuff that makes liquid spew out of aerosol cans,
some environmentalists are worrying that it was simply a matter of
swapping one evil for another.
   ``In a sense we did,'' said Lon Burnam, clean air consultant for
the Sierra Club in Dallas. ``But you can easily make the argument
that the one that we went to is less harmful than the one that we
left.''
   Most of today's aerosol products are pushed out of the can by
hydrocarbons, a propellant that gained wide use when a government
ban on chlorofluorocarbons went into effect in March 1978.
   The order to remove CFCs from most aerosols came after
scientists found the propellants might be reaching the upper
atmosphere and thinning the ozone layer that shields people and
plants from the sun's potentially harmful ultraviolet rays.
   The hydrocarbons that replaced CFCs help form ozone _ but close
to the ground, where it contributes to the smoggy haze that scores
of cities are struggling to combat. Extended exposure is known to
cause or aggravate respiratory problems.
   Although hydrocarbons are found in much greater concentrations
in vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, some officials under
pressure to clear the air are looking at limiting the use of
aerosols.
   ``We're beginning to run out of things we can do in the
industrial sector. We've also already done quite a bit with the
automobile,'' said Les Montgomery, director of regulation
development for the Texas Air Control Board. ``Consumer areas are
getting to be the remaining area that we haven't done too much in.''
   New York City officials, for instance, are seeking the aerosol
industry's cooperation in reducing the hydrocarbons given off by
air fresheners and spray pesticides.
   ``We'll be asking manufacturers by a specified date to submit
their own plan for reducing the ozone-creating pollutants in their
products,'' said R.W. Groneman, a spokesman for the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   New York officials expect to propose the regulations by early
April. New Jersey officials are keeping tabs on the effort,
Groneman said.
   But the aerosol industry has been opposed to further regulation
after its experience with the fluorocarbon ban _ ``the biggest
thing to hit the industry in the 1970s,'' according to Evelyne
McFeaters of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association.
   The group represents about 400 makers of household products.
   ``The ban cost the industry $1 billion to retool,'' Ms.
McFeaters said. ``With this proposal, we'd be seeing an even
greater cost. They're talking about potentially billions of
dollars. The hydrocarbon propellants are the major propellants in
use.''
   Last fall, the Texas Air Control Board proposed a ban on most
aerosols in Dallas and neighboring Fort Worth, one of 14
metropolitan areas trying to develop air quality regulations
acceptable to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   The 14 metro areas have been found by EPA to be in violation of
Clean Air Act standards, but they won reprieves from federal
sanctions. Now, their plans for reducing levels of ozone and other
pollutants are to take effect Aug. 31.
   Under the proposed Dallas-Fort Worth ban, state officials wanted
different propellants used or wanted stores to clear their shelves
of the hydrocarbon aerosol products, ranging from hair spray to
insecticides and paint.
   The ban on so-called Volatile Organic Compounds eventually was
scrapped because of opposition from consumers, retailers and the
aerosol industry. The industry association estimated the ban could
have cost the area more than $77 million annually in sales.
   Besides, consumers probably would have skirted the ban by
driving to neighboring counties to buy aerosols, said Ralph Engel,
president of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturing Association.
   Aerosol manufacturers are skeptical about substitute propellants
suggested to take the place of hydrocarbons.
   ``Many of the possible substitutes could actually increase the
amount of VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) in the air,'' Ms.
McFeaters said.
   One non-aerosol alternative is the pump spray.
   ``I would think people prefer aerosols to pump sprays because of
the extra effort involved in using a pump,'' said Jim May, a
spokesman for S.C. Johnson and Co. But the Racine, Wis.-based
company had no research on consumer acceptance of pump-spray
products.
   The company, known for its Johnson's Wax products, uses
hydrocarbons _ most often propane and butane _ in more than 90
percent of its products, May said.
   Montgomery of the Texas Air Control Board says he recognizes an
aerosol ban would be difficult to enforce.
   ``It would need to be a national thing,'' he said. ``It's
unlikely to expect that a major corporation with a national or
international market is going to reformulate its propellant just
for the Dallas-Fort Worth market.''
   But Burnam noted that automakers have accommodated California's
stricter air pollution laws by offering cleaner-operating versions
of their cars in that state.
   ``It's not only practical, but a reasonable thing to do,'' he
said of banning aerosols. ``There's a whole range of products that
are a waste of the consumer's dollar and are counterproductive to
healthy living.''
   Besides aerosol air fresheners and cleaning products, the
proposed Texas ban also would have limited solvents used in house
and car paints, as well as other products that give off fumes.
   Montgomery expected similar proposed limits on consumer products
may become more widespread.
   ``If the current federal clean-air act requirements keep driving
areas to try to work on this ozone problem and, as we run out of
other things, I guess it's a type of control that other areas may
look at.''

<HEAD>Hawaii Marijuana Crop Flourishes Despite Government Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nestled in the lush jungles of the Hawaiian
islands is a multibillion-dollar industry that the local growers
protect, the government destroys, the vistors bureau rarely
mentions and tourists often overlook on secluded mountain trails.
   It is marijuana, and despite the government's best efforts to
eradicate it, the state's largest cash crop continues to flourish
and enjoy the reputation as some of the best ``pakalolo'' in the
world.
   The government destroys more pot plants here than anywhere else
in the United States, but still the crop thrives, nurtured by
year-round, near-perfect growing conditions.
   ``A prayer goes into the ground with every plant,'' said Roger
Christie, spokesman for the Marijuana Political Action Committee in
Hilo and a member of the Cambridge, Mass.-based Cannabis Corp.
``These islands are a magic place for growing pakololo. The sun,
the rain, the energy of the volcano all combine to create the right
conditions.''
   The islands' light, misty rain, which was considered a blessing
by ancient Hawaiians, is also a boon to pot growers, Christie said,
adding that the year-round sunshine is rarely intense enough to
scorch the plants.
   ``Oh, the stuff here is definitely legendary,'' said George
Auflick, agent in charge at the Drug Enforcement Agency here.
``Hawaii pot is so highly prized that a lot of growers from other
Pacific islands ship their stuff to Honolulu first, just so it can
go to the mainland with a Hawaii postmark. It's just got sort of a
mythical reputation.''
   That reputation is reflected in the price, Auflick said. Locally
grown marijuana goes for about $150 an ounce on the islands, he
said. But on the mainland, what is known as Maui Wowie, Kona Gold
and Puna Butter sells for about $300 to $500 an ounce, with the
highest prices on the East Coast. In comparison, an ounce of
Mexican or Californian marijuana fetches $60 an ounce in Los
Angeles, with Colombian selling for about $200 an ounce, according
to the Narcotics Division of the Los Angeles Police Department.
   Prices here rise after each big raid, and lately the going rate
has been steep. That pleases Capt. Richard Carter, the head of the
criminal investigation unit of the police department on the ``Big
Island'' of Hawaii, where an estimated 66 percent of the state's
crop is grown.
   ``Every time the price goes up, that means there is less of it
around,'' Carter said. ``And that means we're doing our job.''
   Law enforcement officials say marijuana harms the younger
population that has grown up with it and creates crime and violence.
   In 1987, 1.25 million marijuana plants and 752 pounds of dried
pot were seized on the Big Island alone, Carter said. Each plant is
considered to be worth $1,000, which means more than $1.2 billion
worth of marijuana was recovered last year on the Big Island alone.
   Authorities figure about 1.8 million plants were destroyed
throughout the state. But for every plant destroyed, two or three
were left to flourish, Carter said.
   ``They (the growers) know we can't get to it all,'' Carter said.
``So they sort of plant some for us and some for them. But lately
we've been getting to a lot of the stuff they'd thought they'd
hidden.''
   The department patrols well-known growing areas daily, Carter
said, but ``Operation Green Harvest'' is the department's
twice-a-year all-out effort to get rid of the crop. Coinciding with
the major harvesting times, the joint effort between the local
police and National Guard has all the makings of a Hollywood movie.
   Helicopters swoop over acres of green fields, carrying specially
trained officers. When a sizable marijuana crop is spotted, the
cops rush into the fields, armed with machetes, and leave a swath
of destruction, Carter said. Some officers even rappel down from
the helicopters into hard-to-reach, mountainside gardens. And
police have a new weapon _ diesel oil _ which is even more
efficient, he said. Sprayed on crops, it destroys them, ``roots and
all,'' he said.
   Arrests are infrequent during ``Operation Green Harvest,''
Carter said, because the whirring helicopters warn growers of the
impending raid.
   The authorities' increased efficiency has forced growers to be
more careful about camouflaging their crops _ scattering them with
as few as 25 plants to a patch, or planting under the leafy canopy
of Ohia trees or in remote canyons or rocky mountainsides.
   Still, many growers are not secretive at all, and plant
marijuana at the edge of papaya or sugar cane fields, Carter said.
   That kind of defiance has some officials on the mainland worried
about whether Hawaii law enforcement officials are really doing all
they can to rid the state of a drug trade that is said to bring in
more than $4 billion a year, second only to the tourist industry.
   The issue got national attention recently after Rep. Charles
Rangel, the chairman of the U.S. House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, released a report claiming that the
drug trade in Hawaii was a major industry that had bought influence
in the state government.
   Local reaction to the New York Democrat's allegations was swift
and angry, with Rep. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, calling Rangel's
contentions unjustifiable. After the outcry, the committee agreed
to hold hearings on the issue in Hawaii this spring.
   ``Anybody who lives here _ unless they have their head in the
sand _ knows we have a drug problem. But we're doing everything we
can to fight it,'' said Carolyn Tanaka, press secretary to Hawaii
Gov. John Waihee.
   ``Illegal cultivation brings a lot of money to the growers, but
not to the state in general,'' she said, adding, ``We don't care
how much money marijuana would bring in, trying to legalize it just
so it can be taxed is out of the question.''
   But the Marijuana PAC's Christie, who is leading a drive to
legalize marijuana for medical use in Hawaii, said the state is
giving up a valuable source of revenue in it's zeal ``to dictate
the public morality.'' A derivative of marijuana has been used to
relieve some side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients.
   Eradication of marijuana is ``not an issue of the government
caring for the people,'' Christie said. ``If that were the issue,
they'd ban the shot glass and the beer mug.''
   He said marijuana can be used to make rope, paper and canvas.
   The best efforts of local, state and federal law enforcement
officials will not stop the marijuana farmers, Christie said.
   Backyard growers with just a few plants can make up to $20,000 a
year, he said, while those with larger plots rake in $80,000 and up
annually.
   ``The bottom line is that more people than ever want the
stuff,'' he said, ``and there is plenty of it here.''

   Mister Rogers is introducing his young viewers
to a new neighbor this week, and he'd like nothing more than for
everyone to be friends.
   The land is the Soviet Union, which he visited last year as a
guest on Moscow's ``Good Night, Little Ones.'' The neighbor is
Tatiana Vedeneeva, the Soviet television program's host who
subsequently dropped by ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.''
   The aim, both say, is to foster a better understanding between
the two countries through the eyes and ears of the young.
   ``That's the goal of the neighborhood anyway, to be able to
understand and care for yourself better and as you understand and
care for yourself, you look through understanding eyes at your
neighbor,'' said Fred Rogers, creator and host of ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood.''
   ``Just like children grow little by little, one increment after
another, that's the way human beings grow. I think that that's the
way countries grow in trust, just one step at a time,'' he
explained with the same gentleness that has become his on-screen
trademark.
   This exchange of pint-sized culture, a year in the making, could
turn those steps into leaps, according to Rogers and Vedeneeva. An
inspired Rogers, in fact, is considering trips to other countries.
   ``Even though they (children) are tiny, it's a big bridge,''
Vedeneeva said during her November visit to Pittsburgh's WQED-TV,
home of ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' for the past 20 years.
   Rogers' visit to ``Good Night, Little Ones'' last September will
be aired by the Public Broadcasting Service on Tuesday. The show
includes street scenes of Moscow.
   ``Even though I can't see those people right now, I can think
about them and know that they're somewhere,'' Rogers tells his
viewers. ``And they're not pretend. They're real. Just like you.
Even though you're not in this room on this couch with me, you're
somewhere and you're real.''
   Ms. Vedeneeva's visit to ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' will be
shown Thursday. Rogers greets her with a song he composed just for
the occasion.
   ``We would like to welcome you. It's good to be in touch. We
would like to welcome you. Our friendship means so much,'' he
sings, accompanying himself at the piano.
   The message of this week's programs, according to Rogers, is
``that children in the Soviet Union start out as babies and get to
be toddlers and get to be pre-schoolers and school-age children
just like children here.''
   ``It's (also) trying to demonstrate that adults throughout the
world care for children and that people as far away as the Soviet
Union have tender feelings about their children, just the way
Americans do,'' he said.
   For Vedeneeva, the similarities are just as striking.
   ``Our children love the same thing as your children love to
do,'' she said in Russian. ``They would love to get acquainted with
American children and especially with Mister Rogers.''
   Soviet children last December got their first glimpse of the
cardigan- and sneakers-clad Rogers, the first guest ever to appear
on Ms. Vedeneeva's nightly 15-minute show. The broadcast coincided
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's summit meeting with
President Reagan.
   Except for a few words of Russian, the 59-year-old Rogers spoke
English on the Soviet set. Still, he managed to master one phrase
that he repeated again and again to the many children he met:
``Boodish li ti moy sawsed?'' or ``Won't you be my neighbor?''
   Ms. Vedeneeva, who speaks little English, was assisted by a
translator for ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.'' The interpreter
figures prominently on Thursday's show, narrating a segment showing
how Russian Matrouska dolls are made.
   ``I don't think we've ever had an interpreter on the set. So
that could help children see what that's like,'' Rogers said.
   Rogers was accompanied to Moscow by hand puppets Daniel Tiger
and `X' the Owl. Vedeneeva made her first journey to the United
States with Stepashka the Rabbit and Xrysha the Pig.
   The puppets _ kukli in Russian _ seemed to have as much fun as
their creators. Daniel Tiger and Xrysha the Pig, in fact, shared a
shy smooch in Moscow.
   ``Oooh, you're such a big pig. A Bolshoi pig,'' Daniel Tiger
told Xrysha. ``I like you.''
   Stepashka, however, seemed to put it best.
   ``Girls and boys, we're going to be your good neighbors. It
means good friends, too,'' the rabbit said before leaving ``Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood.''
   ``Goodbye,'' it said, waving at the cameras. ``I love you.''

<TEXT>
   The White House, business groups and some
political office seekers, such as George Bush, just won't let go of
the matter, and so it is seems destined to grow into a major issue.
   Issues are created by differences of opinion strongly held, and
on this there are many opinions. It is controversial, debatable,
emotional. It can be construed as a battle of haves versus
have-nots, rich vs. poor.
   The question: Should the capital gains tax, which was raised in
the Tax Reform Act of 1986, be reduced _ perhaps to a rate even
lower than before?
   Central to the issue is another question: Can revenues be raised
by cutting the capital gains tax, as the White House and Bush
suggest?
   Backers of a cut cite the U.S. Treasury's own statistics in
support of their view. They point to steady increases in revenues
since the tax was cut from 49 percent to 28 percent in 1979, and
then to 20 percent in 1981.
   In 1978, when the 49 percent maximum rate was still in effect,
tax revenue amounted to $9.1 billion. In 1984, latest year for
which figures are available, the total was $19.6 billion.
   Sharp as these statistical differences are, some critics
maintain they are not as significant as they seem. Stock market
prices, they point out, have risen sharply over the years. They say
it is this that accounts for the rise.
   Why should lower taxes raise revenues? Because, say defenders of
a lower tax, those taxpayers with capital gains wouldn't be afraid
to take them. Until those gains are realized, they observe, Uncle
Sam gets nothing at all.
   The crux of their argument is that those with big gains in
securities or other investments, including housing, decline to sell
because of the 28 percent tax liability. If it were half that, they
say, sellers would be more active.
   They contend that while this added activity would be taxed at a
relatively lower rate, the government would earn more revenue
because of the greater volume. Estimates vary, but conceivably
these gains could be sizable.
   David Burton of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates a
reduction to 15 percent would produce at least $3.5 billion more
each year. Harvard economist Lawrence Lindsey puts the added
revenue at $31 billion over three years.
   One of the most formidable arguments against the reduction is
that it might produce a spurt of selling in the first couple of
years, but that the benefits to Uncle Sam would be decidedly less
dramatic after that.
   In short, say these critics, the cut itself rather than the rate
of tax is the important thing. They agree that many taxpayers would
take advantage of the cut to take postponed capital gains, but that
afterward the impact would erode.
   Defenders also contend that the country _ not just those with
capital gains _ needs lower rates in order to spur investment in
new businesses, new jobs and new technology _ which, of course,
would enlarge the revenue-producing sector.
   They indicate that as matters stand a goodly amount of potential
venture capital is tied up in old enterprises, left there by owners
who cannot afford to pay _ or who choose to defer paying _ the
taxes that would become due.
   Potentially the hottest dispute of all is the contention that a
lower capital gains tax benefits the rich and does very little, at
least immediately, for the poor. It could be a dispute loaded with
more passion than content.
   Prof. Lindsey states that 80 percent of the $31 billion he
refers to would be paid by taxpayers with incomes greater than
$100,000. Inherent in that statement, however, is that most of the
tax benefits would go to them also.
   The subject is at the heart of at least two bills in Congress.
Over the next few months, it could become a political hot potato.

<HEAD>Mood is Bleak in Hungary as Austerity Program Takes Effect</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when the winds blowing from the
Soviet Union bring the refreshing possibility of greater openness
and reform, Hungarians find their once-vaunted economy faltering.
   The government is warning them to expect a decline in living
standards, regarded as the best in the East bloc.
   All that combined with uncertainty over the tenure of the
75-year-old Communist Party leader Janos Kadar is leaving
Hungarians in a bleak and wary mood.
   Yet, the outward signs of economic trouble are few in this
lovely capital on the Danube. Shops along the glittering Vaci
pedestrian mall are well-stocked and bustling, traffic clamors
along the old Chain Bridge with BMWs and Hondas vying with
Soviet-made Fiats and Czech Skodas, and women are dressed in
stylish furs.
   ``It's only in the windows,'' said a Budapest businessman.
   Scratch beneath the surface, he added, and it becomes apparent
that times are getting harder.
   A government austerity program took effect Jan. 1, imposing the
East bloc's first personal income tax and value-added tax. In
addition, the government says inflation could rise from last year's
8 to 9 percent to 15 percent this year, which would make it the
worst in the country's postwar history.
   Compared to some nations in Eastern Europe, Hungary remains an
island of prosperity and economic stability. Poland is expecting
inflation of 40 to 45 percent this year. Inflation in Yugoslavia
reached 170 percent this past fall.
   But Hungary's economic woes arose over the last few years with
``breathtaking suddenness,'' one party member said. ``Therefore we
are bitter.''
   The three-year ``program of consolidation,'' as the austerity
measures are called, is intended to raise revenues to bridge
yawning government deficits, caused largely by huge subsidies to
money-losing industries.
   The government plans to phase out unprofitable factories,
raising fears of increasing unemployment. Some analysts say the
jobless total could rise from 10,000 (0.2 percent) today to 200,000
(3.3 percent) of the 6-million-member work force.
   Hungary borrowed in the 1970s to build heavy industry. Now, its
10.6 million people are burdened with a gross hard currency debt of
$16 billion, the highest per capita in the Soviet bloc.
   On the positive side, exports to the West in 1987 were up 13
percent to $5.08 billion and tourism boomed, with more than 18
million people visiting the country. Hungary's state-dominated
agriculture continues to produce more than the country can consume.
   The austerity program is the work of 57-year-old Prime Minister
Karoly Grosz, who took over government administration in July.
Since then, he has discussed Hungary's problems with a frankness
that surprised many of his countrymen.
   Acknowledging calls for greater democratization, a Communist
Party committee has promulgated a set of theses on political
reforms and the party's ``leading role'' which has been presented
to basic party cells and is to be put before a Central Committee
meeting.
   If approved, the proposals would probably be forwarded to the
first national party conference since 1957, which a party source
said is expected early in June.
   The theses generally endorse greater consultation between the
party and the population, more open debate in the party and a
retreat from day-to-day party involvement in the government.
   Diplomats said the theses appear to generate little enthusiasm.
Members of the unofficial opposition said they are disappointed by
the proposals, calling them too vague to bring substantial change.
   ``There are many words about the necessity of political reform,
but I am afraid that the speeches are not so sincere,'' said Gyorgy
Gado, an opposition writer. ``I am afraid they haven't the courage
to make the necessary changes.''
   Meanwhile, the question on everybody's mind is whether Kadar
will retire and who will take his place as head of the party, a
senior Western diplomat said.
   Behind-the-scenes jockeying for position is practically
paralyzing the government, the diplomat added. ``Nobody does
anything except politics right now.''
   Grosz is considered the leading candidate and the favorite of
the Soviets, even though his relations with party regulars and the
coterie around Kadar appear strained, said the diplomat, speaking
only on condition of anonymity.
   Also mentioned as possible successors are chief party ideologist
Janos Berecz and, as a darkhorse, Imre Pozsgay, the leader of the
national unity People's Patriotic Front, who advocates more
dialogue with groups outside the party.
   Kadar has been at the helm of the party since the Soviet
suppression of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Described variously
by diplomats in Budapest as ``a wily old fox'' and ``a declining
king surrounded by courtiers,'' he has given no known indication
that he will step aside.
   But sources in and outside the party said Kadar increasingly is
out of touch with economic problems and is an obstacle to political
reform.
   ``He has not been a bad dictator. Even if you disagreed with him
you could work,'' said a party member. ``Now people want results.''
   ``People feel as long as he's in power no real changes can
happen,'' said Ferenc Koszeg, editor of the illegal magazine
Beszelo (Talker).
   And the public mood?
   ``Very gloomy,'' said the diplomat. ``Compared to a year ago,
the situation is closer to instability, although I still believe
it's less than a 50-50 chance.''
   Said Koszeg: ``People are so disappointed that they don't
believe anybody any longer. This is an important handicap both for
the government and the opposition.''

<HEAD>Indiana Jones Finds More Mature Roles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BEARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Star Wars'' and ``Raiders of the Lost Ark''
made Harrison Ford one of America's top box office draws, but the
actor says both he and his audience are maturing.
   ``I'm not an ingenue anymore,'' the 45-year-old actor said.
   His most recent effort leaves Han Solo and Indiana Jones in
hyperspace. In the just-released Roman Polanski thriller,
``Frantic,'' Ford's cocksure quality disappears as he portrays a
bespectacled father and husband caught in a situation beyond his
control.
   It follows ``Witness'' and ``The Mosquito Coast,'' two other
movies where Ford shucked invulnerability for more complex and
sensitive roles. In his next film, the Mike Nichols comedy
``Working Girls,'' he has a Cary Grant-type part.
   ``I'm not trying to make a transition into a different kind of
persona; I do whatever I think is appropriate for that character to
tell the story,'' he said during a recent interview.
   ``But this is also related to growing older,'' he said,
fingering his reading glasses in his right hand. ``I mean, `Star
Wars' was almost 15 years ago. I am 15 years older. There's no
sense denying it. In fact, I revel in it. I've been more interested
in those characters that are more mature.''
   In ``Frantic,'' Ford grows more uncomfortable in every scene. He
plays a California heart surgeon at a medical conference in Paris.
Terrorists kidnap his wife, but police and U.S. officials believe
she willingly left him. He meets a sensuous young French woman who
provides clues to the abduction and joins him in a struggle to find
his wife.
   ``The whole thing depends on this doctor, this fish out of
water, reaching this emotional exhaustion, where he does things
that are well outside of his nature and experience,'' said Ford.
   A concern for his real-life wife's safety led Ford to Paris,
Polanski and the part. He accompanied his pregnant wife,
screenwriter Melissa Mathison (``E.T.''), to meetings in Paris on
an another project with Polanski, the director of ``Tess,''
``Chinatown'' and ``Rosemary's Baby.''
   ``After the first few days, Roman described the film to me and
it sounded interesting,'' Ford said.
   The script was in French, a language the actor does not speak.
``Roman stood up and for two hours _ he told me the movie,'' Ford
said. ``He played all the parts, and he was great. When it was
over, I said, `If you'll right that down in English, I'll do it.'''
   Ford calls himself ``mono-maniacal'' during filming, but always
returns to his ranch in Wyoming to ``go grocery shopping, pick up
the laundry, work on the fence, plow the snow, read a little, fish
a little and go cross-country skiing.''
   Wyoming is now home for Ford. He was raised in a suburban
Chicago, went to school at Ripon College in Wisconsin and struggled
as an actor and carpenter in southern California. ``Star Wars''
gave him the success and security to buy the ranch and spend some
time there.
   ``I wouldn't be able to do it (acting) if I wasn't able to get
back when it was over,'' he said.
   His current project is ``Working Girls,'' a comedy set in New
York about a secretary who fights to retrieve an idea from a boss
who has claimed credit for it.
   ``One of the pleasures of this comedy is that it's a relatively
smaller part,'' said Ford, who called the last two pictures
``killers.'' In ``Working Girls,'' he plays the boyfriend of
Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver.
   This fall, production begins on a third ``Raiders'' movie. When
that's over, Ford will head back to his wife, his 10-month-old son,
Malcolm, and the ranch.
   And then?
   ``I'm planning to take the next year off,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brat Packers and Glamour Girls _ The New Hollywood Politicos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY FARAH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Rob Lowe is best known for his ``Brat
Pack'' movie roles and romances with actress Melissa Gilbert and
Princess Stephanie of Monaco.
   But the heartthrob of the teeny-bopper set also is an active
crusader against toxic wastes.
   He and other young screen actors, such as Ally Sheedy, Judd
Nelson, Daphne Zuniga and Alexandra Paul, are just a few of
Hollywood's new breed of celebrity political activists.
   ``They represent a new generation of artists who have, like
athletes, a tremendous effect at being role models for young
people,'' said California Assemblyman Tom Hayden.
   ``They're taken more seriously with Americans than politicians
because people know them. ... It's a very healthy tonic for an
apathetic generation.''
   Hayden was a founder of Students for a Democratic Society, one
of the most visible student radical organizations of the 1960s, and
is the husband of actress Jane Fonda, another celebrity activist.
   In 1985, the Haydens became curious about the true interests of
the so-called Brat Packers, who had been labeled selfish and
self-centered by critics. They invited a few to their Santa Monica
home, including Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Demi Moore, Emilio
Estevez, Gilbert, Nelson and Lowe.
   Once the Haydens saw an interest was there, they formed Network,
an educational group that explains political issues to actors and
introduces them to politicians.
   ``They are incredibly effective at motivating and opening up
your minds,'' Sheedy said of the couple. ``It's not something where
they're trying to brainwash you in any way. There's no pressure at
all.''
   Her involvement in Network prompted the young star of ``War
Games'' and ``The Breakfast Club'' to throw a mixer with Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) for her actor friends.
   ``It was so much fun. It was so exciting,'' Sheedy said.
   Another Hollywood activist group, Young Artists United, was
formed two years ago by Paul, who starred in ``Dragnet,'' and
filmmaker Daniel Sladek. YAU involves young people in such social
issues as teen suicide and drug and alcohol abuse, rather than
political issues.
   Some YAU members include Sarah Jessica Parker, star of TV's ``A
Year in the Life,'' Eric Stoltz of ``Mask'' and most of the Network
members.
   YAU plans to put about 30 of the young actors on a bus caravan
this April and cruise the Southern California beach communities,
urging young people to register to vote.
   ``I think there's a major transformation going on in the people
of this generation from the `me' generation to the `we' generation.
They realize they can accomplish a lot united,'' said the
23-year-old Sladek.
   For fear of alienating their fans, actors generally remained
aloof from politics until the 1930s, when Hollywood threw its
support behind President Roosevelt and his social policies.
   Hollywood staged massive support for World War II, with war bond
rallies and entertaining the troops abroad. Some notables,
especially Charlie Chaplin, supported the Soviet cause, and their
activities would haunt them later.
   The postwar period brought McCarthyism, when many careers were
harmed or ruined through ``blacklisting'' by association with
leftist causes. The reaction caused many actors to eschew support
of any issues or candidates, and continued into the 1960s.
   However, the Civil Rights Movement brought out such actors as
Marlon Brando on marches, sit-ins and rallies. The Vietnam War,
environmental issues and women's rights also rekindled Hollywood's
social consciousness.
   This will be a busy year for Network, said spokesman Patrick
Lippert. Members will start meeting presidential candidates at
private meetings in the spring and will probably become active in
the 1988 elections.
   Last September, members of both groups worked against Robert
Bork's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court by staging a
post-card writing campaign with their peers.
   In October, Nelson (``Billionaire Boys Club,'' ``The Breakfast
Club''), Helen Slater (``Supergirl''), Esai Morales (``La Bamba'')
and Mary Stuart Masterson (``At Close Range'') traveled to the
Soviet Union to film a documentary for the National Committee for a
Sane Nuclear Policy.
   Zuniga (``Spaceballs'') and Paul visited Nicaragua, where Paul
rode in a Soviet-made helicopter with Sandinistas.
   ``Everyone was saying two years ago this is the most
self-centered, selfish generation in years,'' Lippert said. ``But
what you see is the most idealistic group of young people. You see
them getting involved in so many things, and reaching out to their
generation.''
   However, not all Hollywood observers are jumping with praise for
the political meanderings of brat packers.
   ``It's striking that not one of these stars has a dissenting
view other than what's the norm in Hollywood,'' said Michael Medved
of PBS' ``Sneak Previews.''
   ``It's absolutely nonsensical that Alan Cranston should follow
Rob Lowe's advice to vote against Robert Bork for the Supreme
Court,'' he continued. ``Rob Lowe, Daphne Zuniga and Gregory Peck
(who did an anti-Bork commercial) _ we take their position
seriously because they're pretty. It's scary.
   ``I think they are sincerely interested in the issues. But part
of burnishing your image is not to be written off as a pretty-face
airhead. So you become politically involved.''
   Also dabbling in politics are such Hollywood glamour girls as
Morgan Fairchild, Donna Mills and Sally Field.
   Field, a two-time Academy Award winner, was host of a poolside
party at her home that featured Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
a presidential contender. Mills, the scheming vixen of CBS-TV's
``Knots Landing,'' talked politics with Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.),
another presidential hopeful, at a gathering at her home.
   Fairchild, who has testified before both the House and Senate on
environmental issues, has given up needlepoint and instead spends
her free time reading such weighty material as ``Abu Nidal: Master
Terrorist'' or hefty medical reports on the deadly AIDS virus.
   ``I know that going in, a lot of people didn't take me
seriously,'' said Fairchild, who has no intention of giving up her
sexy image. ``But I have a deceptively high I.Q. and so when people
sat down and started talking to me about some of these things, they
started to take me seriously.''

<HEAD>Some Market Analysts Still Leery of `Bear Trap'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the stock market has rallied in recent
months from its drastic drop last year, some wary analysts caution
that it is still following the pattern set in 1929 and 1930.
   After the Great Crash in October 1929, the market regained its
balance and recovered nearly 50 percent of its losses. But that
rise turned out to be a deadly trap.
   By the time stock prices finally bottomed out in 1932, they were
down about 90 percent from their peaks. A drop of the same
magnitude today would put the Dow Jones industrial average at about
275.
   No market analyst with a wide following on Wall Street is
currently predicting anything close to that. Along with the
similarities, most observers say, there are many differences in the
world of the 1980s from the situation that prevailed nearly 60
years ago.
   Furthermore, they say, if history were prone to repeating itself
with any reliability in the market, the pursuit of making money in
stocks would be a lot easier than it is.
   Still, a good many people in the business of giving financial
advice are very mindful these days of what is now known as the
``sucker rally'' of early 1930.
   ``The entire price action of the past few years has tracked the
1928-1930 span like clockwork,'' says Martin Zweig, a New York
investment adviser, in the current issue of his letter The Zweig
Forecast.
   ``The odds that this is the start of a new bull market are
remote at the moment,'' he argues.
   Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities, says stocks at their recent prices reflect
some hopes about the economic outlook that may go unfulfilled.
   ``We think the probability of a recession, and perhaps a severe
one, is fairly high,'' he observes, ``and we also think that the
current level of stock prices does not discount a recession.''
   Optimists on the market outlook, whose numbers have been growing
lately, describe the recent behavior of stocks as healthy-looking.
   One distinct positive, they say, is that many smaller stocks
have been rising faster lately than the blue chips that make up the
Dow Jones industrial average, after lagging behind through the
latter stages of the 1982-87 bull market. In theory at least, that
betokens broad support for stocks.
   Zweig says he is well aware of this view, but questions its
validity. In the first three months of 1930, he says, a broad
measure of stock prices he calculated rose 24.9 percent, while the
Dow was up 15.3 percent.
   ```Positive' divergence, as most call it, is normal after
crashes which lead to continuing bear markets,'' he says.
   Both Zweig and Miller acknowledge the possibility that they are
wrong, and both hold some stocks in their recommended portfolios.
   As Zweig put it: ``If this turns out to be a bull market, which
I doubt, then fine. We own stocks now. If it's a bear rally, I'll
look for exit signs as we go.''
   Should the advance turn out to be a ``sucker rally'' like the
one in 1930, Zweig concedes it will be a tricky mission to pluck
the bait out before the trap snaps shut.
   ``I suspect that the rally, which looks OK on the tape, will

   Japan's latest comic book heros are Emperor
Hirohito and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Comic books are widely read in Japan by both children and adults
and often are used as teaching aids for such topics as history,
economics or etiquette and even to explain frictions with the
United States over trade.
   The Hirohito comic book, which is in hard cover and is titled
``Tenno Heika'' (Emperor), follows the 86-year-old monarch from
childhood through World War II, including his historic surrender
broadcast in 1945, and into his quiet retirement in Tokyo's
Imperial Palace.
   The book on Nakasone is called ``Yatchan's,'' which was the
former prime minister's childhood nickname. It is published
quarterly by Nakasone's office and sent to supporters and
constituents.
   Japanese prime ministers, once they step down, traditionally
fade into the political background and take the role of party
elder, occasionally seen but seldom heard.
   But Nakasone, whose term in office ended this past November, has
stayed in the news through trips abroad and the establishment of a
think-tank group. ``Yatchan's'' helps keep attention focused on him.
   ``The idea for a cartoon newsletter has been gestating for a
long time, and it just happens that it was produced after
Nakasone-san left office,'' said Masaki Donji, a private secretary
to Nakasone. ``There was no deliberate timing to keep him in the
news.''
   While purporting to depict faithfully the characters' lives and
careers, the comic books seem overly flattering.
   Hirohito is shown as barrel-chested and cheerful rather than the
aged and stooped man he is now.
   Nakasone, now 67, is shown as burly, with round eyes and a
uncharacteristic full head of hair.
   But the comic book presents little-known facets of Nakasone's
life.
   An essay by Nakasone's wife Tsutako says that, in his younger
days when he was known as Yatchan, Nakasone pranced about in his
underwear after baths, humming music from Swan Lake. And on state
visits abroad as prime minister, he grudgingly allowed his wife off
elevators first, but upon returning to Japanese soil, would
instantly declare, ``Ladies first is over.''
   ``Yatchan's'' opens with Nakasone's return from the 1987 summit
in Venice, Italy, with photos of the six in-flight meals he was
served on his special jet. It then flashes back to the beginning: a
fiery-eyed Nakasone resigning from Tokyo's Metropolitan Police
Department in 1946 to work toward Japan's postwar reconstruction.
   He reveals himself as an idealist who patterns himself after
Sakura Sogo, a 17th-century village headman who was executed for
seeking reduced taxes for poor peasants.
   He eats potatoes for lunch _ an expression of humility _ and
chooses a white bicycle for his first political campaign because
Hirohito rode a white horse.
   Subscriptions to ``Yatchan's'' are 2,000 yen ($15.50) a year.
The booklet also includes reproductions of Nakasone's paintings,
and samples of his haiku poetry.
   The Hirohito book divulges some imperial trivia: the emperor has
no surname, reached adulthood at age 18 (20 for ordinary Japanese),
and cannot adopt children or vote.
   It also explains that his duties include opening sessions of the
Diet (parliament), closing sessions of the House of
Representatives, receiving foreign ambassadors, and formally
approving laws, government decrees, amendments to the constitution
and treaties.
   Hirohito, once regarded as a living god, remains a sensitive
subject in modern Japan, and ribbing of royalty by the press is
neither tolerated nor attempted.
   But the comic book touches on some sensitive points in the
emperor's life, including an assassination attempt, the great Kanto
earthquake of 1923 for which Hirohito was later criticized for not
doing enough for his people, and a 1936 military rebellion that led
to the death of one of his favored ministers.
   It also touches briefly on his role in World War II, although it
reveals little about his activities or motivations during the
conflict, and portrays Hirohito's famed speech imploring the nation
in August 1945 to bear the unbearable _ surrender.
   The emperor's trips to Europe and the United States are shown,
including protesters waving signs saying ``Go Home'' and ``Fascist
Hirohito.'' It ends with him enjoying his favorite pastimes,
walking along the beach and studying marine biology.
   An official of the Imperial Household Agency, which tends to the
imperial family's duties and needs, said the agency had nothing to
do with the comic book and extended neither approval or assistance
in its production.

   First El Salvador, then Nicaragua, now Panama.
Like chain reactions, crises spread through Central America.
Despite protests, despite U.S. pressure, Panama's military leader,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the real boss of the country, remains
in power, surviving charges of drug dealing, illicit money
laundering, election fraud and violations of human rights. Here is
a look at how it all came about in a country the United States
deems vital to its security.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Panamanians have lived for years
with the belief, if not the sure knowledge, that their government
is corrupt, their elections are unfair and their leaders lust for
money and power.
   There were protests from time to time, but they seldom lasted
more than a few days. Then the nation would sink back into a
tropical lethargy abetted by prosperity. The voices of opposition
were few.
   Now the lethargy seems to be gone.
   The country is in turmoil over the military rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted in the United States on drug
charges. Prosperity is threatened by a large foreign debt, U.S.
economic pressure and the freezing of Panamanian funds abroad.
   In recent years, money poured in from the Panama Canal, the new
offshore banking center, an oil pipeline that helped carry Alaskan
crude to Atlantic Coast markets, a thriving re-export industry and
a large U.S. military presence.
   It all helped an economy traditionally based on bananas, sugar
and coffee weather the ups and downs of unstable agricultural
markets, and made Panama by far the wealthiest country on the
Central American isthmus.
   ``They were years of indulgence and indifference,'' says Roberto
Brenes, a Panama City investment banker and a leader of the broad
new opposition movement that took firm root only nine months ago.
   ``The rich were getting richer, the middle class was growing and
the lot of the poor was improving,'' said a diplomat with long
experience in Central America. ``It's always been a tolerant
society, and few people saw any need to rock to the boat.''
   Neither did the United States, which saw in Panama enough
stability to make a treaty in 1977 that will deliver control of the
vital canal between the Atlantic and Pacific to the Panamanian
government at the turn of the century.
   Omar Torrijos Herrera, a charismatic army colonel, seized the
government in 1968, broke the traditional rule of wealthy merchants
and land barons and began a costly series of reforms.
   He built schools, schools, hospitals, health clinics,
farm-to-market roads and other public works. With fervent
nationalism, Torrijos brought a new sense of pride and identity to
the country, even its wealthiest citizens.
   Much of his popularity came from his ability to tweak Uncle
Sam's nose while maintaining relations with Washington. Few
Panamanian leaders had risked the slightest impertinance with the
United States.
   His ideology became known as ``Torrijismo'' and survived his
death in an airplane crash in 1981, four years after he signed the
canal treaty with President Jimmy Carter and fulfilled one of the
fondest dreams of the Panamanian people.
   Although the country maintained the fiction of a president,
Torrijos ruled supreme as ``chief of government'' and commander of
the National Guard. He had no real opposition and the nation
prospered from economic growth and public spending financed with
money borrowed abroad.
   Noriega came to power in 1983, four years after Torrijos was
killed, and the first presidential election since the 1968 coup was
held the following year.
   Nicolas Ardito Barletta, a respected economist, was elected
president despite the fact that he had spent years with the World
Bank in Washington and was little known at home.
   His election, by a margin of fewer than 2,000 votes, was tainted
by charges of fraud. Opponents held marches and auto caravans,
honking horns, waving white banners and banging pots and pans in a
traditional Panamanian form of protest.
   Like those before them, the demonstrations died within a week.
   The United States and the rest of the world recognized Ardito
Barletta, as they had six other figurehead presidents installed and
removed by the military since 1968. The first vice president was
Eric Arturo Delvalle, in his first elective office.
   Less than a year later, in September 1985, it became Ardito
Barletta's turn to go.
   He was summoned to military headquarters and held for 12 hours
after calling for an impartial investigation into the murder of
Hugo Spadafora, one of Noriega's chief opponents. Ardito Barletta
announced his resignation and Delvalle was sworn in to replace him.
   Once again, government upheaval was greeted largely by public
apathy.
   Noriega kept building his power, increasing the size of the
military with the help of the United States.
   Washington poured millions of dollars into the general's newly
renamed Panama Defense Forces, a single command encompassing 15,000
members of the army, air force, navy, police forces and state
security agency in this nation of 2.2 million people.
   The canal treaty gives Panama primary responsibility for the
security of the waterway beginning with the year 2000. The Carter
administration, then President Reagan, wanted the Defense Forces to
be up to the task.
   Rumors of military corruption recurred. Then Col. Roberto Diaz
Herrera, one of Noriega's top aides, told reporters last June after
his forced resignation that his former boss had rigged the 1984
elections, was engaged in the illegal selling of visas and had
engineered the Spadafora murder.
   Spadafora's headless, mutilated body was found in August 1985,
stuffed in a canvas U.S. Mail bag just across the border in Costa
Rica. He had threatened to offer proof of Noriega's involvement in
drug trafficking, and his family and friends insisted the general
ordered the brutal murder.
   Until Diaz Herrera began talking, however, no one in the
military's tight inner circle had accused Noriega of so much as
fixing a traffic ticket.
   The former aide's frequent press interviews caused a sensation
They also spawned the National Civic Crusade, a movement begun by a
few wealthy businessmen whose disgust and anger at the military's
increasingly heavy-handed interference in the government and
economy had been building for some time.
   Within weeks, the Crusade grew to an umbrella organization
covering about 200 professional, business, labor and political
groups and had gained support from Panamanians of the middle and
lower classes.

   The Crusade called its first strike June 10. It had little
success but was followed by others and a series of mass protests,
despite a state of emergency decree that forbade public gatherings
and closed opposition newspapers and broadcast stations.
   By July 10, Noriega had enough. He sent soldiers and riot police
to break up a mass rally. More than 100 people were injured, many
peppered by birdshot, and up to 600 were arrested and detained for
four days.
   The movement appeared to lose heart, but bounced back with a
successful strike in late July and a rally Aug. 6 that attracted
30,000 anti-Noriega demonstrators, despite the threat of
repression. Leaders of the Civic Crusade began seeking foreign
support.
   Delvalle's government responded with pro-Noriega rallies and
increasingly virulent attacks on the United States in speeches and
government-owned newspapers.
   It all was done under the cloak of ``Torrijismo,'' but the
garment did not fit Noriega well. In late August, a Gallup poll
indicated three of four Panamanians wanted him to step down.
   After an attack on the U.S. Embassy in June, the Reagan
administration had suspended all military and economic aid, which
would have totaled $21 million this year. That brought howls of
``economic aggression'' from Delvalle and other Panamanian leaders.
   Loss of the aid was particularly painful because Panama faced a
fiscal crisis, brought on by years of deficit spending that piled
up a $4.5 billion foreign debt and capital flight caused by the
civil unrest.
   Early in February, two federal grand juries in Florida indicted
Noriega on charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and
racketeering.
   Among other things, he is accused of helping Colombia's
notorious Medellin Cartel by providing safe airstrips for its
cocaine shipments and safe haven for its hired killers.
   ``What he did was utilize his position to sell the country of
Panama to the traffickers,'' said U.S. Atty. Leon Kellner of Miami,
who led the investigation for one indictment.
   Events began unfolding rapidly Feb. 25 when Delvalle, scorned by
the opposition as a puppet, decided he had had enough and ordered
Noriega's dismissal. The United States said it knew of his
intentions, and continued to recognize him as president through the
ensuing trouble.
   Noriega arranged for the Legislative Assembly to remove Delvalle
the next day _ the special session lasted 10 minutes _ and hours
later Devalle went into hiding.
   The Civic Crusade called another strike, its sixth, last Monday
but acknowledged it would not be enough to drive Noriega from
office even the country closed down completely.
   Opposition leaders said only the United States, with or without
the support of the rest of Latin America, had the financial clout
to depose him.
   At week's end, Roberto Aleman, a lawyer and Civic Crusade
leader, summed up the alliance's hopes:
   ``The government will find itself besieged by economic and
diplomatic measures taken in the United States and Latin America.
The measures will oblige the regime to take extremely unpopular
measures such as raising taxes and firing public employees.''

   Thomas Moscardini talks of Manet and Warhol in
the same breath as undercover stings and doing time.
   For the New York City police detective, the two are as
inextricably linked as oil and canvas.
   Moscardini, an art history student and former undercover
narcotics agent, works full time on recovering the stolen art of
galleries, museums and patrons. His contacts are Interpol, the U.S.
Customs Service, art associations and the art underworld, along
with an unspecified number of paid informants.
   He's part of an elite fraternity of full-time art sleuths, who
range in number to perhaps a half-dozen, depending on the criteria
used to define them.
   Since moving more than four years ago from the dim back alleys
of undercover drugs to the grand halls and cozy galleries of the
art world, the 42-year-old detective has created something of a
name for himself.
   Among the artworks he's recovered was a $500,000 Joan Miro. ``My
best piece was a $1 million Renoir,'' he says.
   ``He's great,'' says Elizabeth Hayt-Atkins, director of art
theft archives at the New York-based International Foundation for
Art Research. ``He plays the part of the knowledgeable art person
very well. He knows the lingo. He knows the artists. So I imagine
when he goes undercover he's perfectly plausible.''
   Moscardini looks the part: trim, impeccably groomed down to his
manicured nails, articulate and art-wise. The only give-away that
he's anything but a connoisseur is the 9mm semi-automatic that
hangs from his lizard-skin belt.
   ``The same gun as James Bond used,'' he quips.
   And he knows the role.
   A frequent weekend visitor to New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art, because it's ``one of those places you have to go to quite
often,'' Moscardini himself dabbles in oils and acrylics. He also
is studying for an art history degree and has lectured on museum
security the last three years at the Smithsonian Institution.
   Moscardini at one time wanted to be a commercial artist. He went
into police work more than 19 years ago, he says, because he needed
a job.
   When the department went looking for a savvy investigator with
an art background, the computer search turned up Moscardini among
the possibilities.
   The detective is full of tales of mostly all-purpose thieves,
sometimes ignorant of the art they steal or the art world, who've
been snared in one of his traps, usually set up in an obliging
gallery staffed with undercover officers.
   Moscardini's own undercover work is probably over now, he says.
``I am known out there. My photo's been around.''
   He estimates only 10 percent to 14 percent of stolen art
worldwide is recovered.
   Although he figures he's recovered $8 million worth of works
over the years, there are millions, too, in unresolved mysteries.
The most recent is the $6 million heist last month from the
Colnaghi Art Gallery, New York's biggest art steal.
   His small office is filled with his work and passion: file
cabinets stuffed with artists' and gallery names, folders each for
missing oil paintings, water colors, folk art, photography; auction
books from Sotheby's and Christie's. Breaking the monotony of the
institutional-white walls, he has hung an Andy Warhol silk-screen
print, a Claude Monet impression and an Erte art deco poster. A
family heirloom Chinese brass vase sits on a file cabinet.
   ``I don't consider myself just a cop. I consider myself a part
of the art world,'' Moscardini said.

   Members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and
church president and prophet Ezra Taft Benson attended the
inauguration of Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham, himself a former Mormon
bishop. Mecham's beliefs are closely tied to church doctrine; his
ties to church leadership strong. So when a storm of turmoil
engulfed the governor, Arizona's Mormon community found itself at
the center.

<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Benson has been a life-long Mormon,
active in church affairs. He is the grandson of church president
and prophet Ezra Taft Benson. Few would question his devotion.
   Few, except impeached Gov. Evan Mecham and some of his
supporters.
   Benson happens to be the award-winning cartoonist for the
Arizona Republic _ and a relentless critic of the embattled
governor. Mecham happens to be Arizona's first Mormon governor and
an unwavering believer in conservative church doctrine.
   In Arizona these days, politics and religion are mixing in the
Mormon community. Mormon critics of Mecham have been scorned by
other Mormons, who say they are not true to their religion. Mecham
even once told Steve Benson his salvation was in jeopardy because
of the biting cartoons.
   ``Sides have been taken and swords drawn,'' said the cartoonist.
``There have been instances of shunning. Letters have been written
questioning one's devotion to the church _ whether one has the
moral rectitude to remain in the flock.''
   With the turmoil have come fears that the brouhaha will damage
the image of Mormons, whose roots trace back to the settling of
Arizona.
   Officially, the church has remained neutral on the governor's
plight. Some members say the only mentions of Mecham from the
pulpit have been reminders of neutrality, and the strife is limited
to a small group of Mormons.
   ``Is the church worried? I think not. It's a matter that will
pass in the next few months,'' said Phoenix attorney Dave Udall, a
church leader designated as the official spokesman.
   Still, individuals within the community say passions run deep.
Some say families have been split by the issues.
   Ed Pagan, a Mormon who is a history graduate student at the
University of Arizona and who criticized Mecham in a letter to the
editor, called the turmoil ``gut-wretching'' for church members.
   ``In a sense, his platform and ideology have the veneer of
unofficial church position,'' said Pagan, whose criticism drew
letters questioning his own faith. ``There are those who say if you
criticize Mecham, you're ultimately criticizing God.''
   An unofficial church newspaper, the Latter-Day Sentinel, has
supported Mecham, and its editor, Crismon Lewis, is a sharp critic
of the Republic's Benson. ``Most of the church is extremely
disappointed in him,'' Lewis said.
   One cartoon that rankled Mecham's Mormon supporters showed an
angel atop the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City, Utah. At the end of
the angel's trumpet was a banner reading, ``Resign, Ev.''
   Some remember the controversy that surrounded Benson's
grandfather during eight years as agriculture secretary under
President Eisenhower.
   ``His grandfather was attacked so much by the press that he
offered his resignation, but Eisenhower kept him,'' said Lewis.
``Now, a couple of decades later, you've got the grandson doing the
same thing.''
   Benson says his grandfather, a personal friend of Mecham's, has
never pressured him to back off. Church-related pressure in
Arizona, he said, comes from an ultra-conservative sect of the
church _ not the mainstream.
   ``Some individuals _ and it's not unique to my religion _
unavoidably mix religion with politics and as a result think any
Mormon who does not agree with a fellow Latter-day Saint who
happens to be governor is endangering his position in the church,''
Benson said.
   ``It's intolerant, and it's silly.''
   And Benson has support among Mormons _ even among some who
support the governor.
   ``He's got his job to do,'' said Democratic state Rep. Jack
Brown, who voted against Mecham's impeachment. ``He can do that and
still be a good member of the Mormon church.''
   Mecham, a 63-year-old native of Duchesne, Utah, was impeached
Feb. 5 by the Arizona House of Representatives on allegations of
concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, misusing $80,000 from a
special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an
alleged death threat involving a state official.
   Trial on the impeachment is under way in the state Senate. If
convicted, Mecham would be removed from office. He also faces a
criminal trial on the campaign loan charge March 22, and a recall
election set for May 17.
   The ultra-conservative governor took office 14 months ago and
immediately plunged himself into controversy by rescinding the
Martin Luther King holiday for state workers and making statements
that have offended women, homosexuals, Jews and Japanese.
   Mormons believe church leaders receive divine guidance, and some
Mecham backers have suggested political leaders do as well. Mecham
himself has occassionally suggested he's received guidance from God.
   To Shirley Whitlock, active in the church and state leader of a
conservative political group called the Eagle Forum, Mormons who
don't support Mecham have lost their religion.
   ``I feel if there are other members of the church who do not
support the governor they either have allowed themselves to be
propagandized or are too liberal and don't understand their own
teachings,'' Mrs. Whitlock said.
   ``If members of the church can't see this man is trying to do
his duty, then there's false belief,'' she said. ``If they don't
support the governor when he supports Constitutional principles,
then they better do more studying.''
   Passions ran high in the Legislature, too, as the impeachment
vote neared. Rep. Brown, a former Mormon bishop, said he received
letters from followers who tried to intimidate him.
   Rep. Mark Killian, a conservative Republican from Mesa, a
popular Mormon area and site of the church's Arizona Temple, broke
into tears as he blasted the governor's behavior, but voted against
the impeachment because he didn't believe the evidence was strong
enough.
   Udall, the Arizona church spokesman, said he cringes when
Mecham's religion is brought into the debate.
   ``Is religion really a factor? I don't think it is,'' he said.
``And we'd prefer not to be getting the attention.''
   Brown said he worries about possible damage to the church.
   ``But I think people basically understand that you have
different kinds of people in the church, and some are not
reflective of the whole group,'' he said.
   ``It's a concern,'' said Wayne Arnett, an attorney and Mormon.
``There will be those who know Mecham is a Mormon and think less of
me because I'm a Mormon.''
   Most Mormons, Mesa bishop Bob Goodman said, ``are sorry the
church has been involved in it.''
   ``But I can't say it's hurt any of my members,'' Goodman said.
``And I can't say it's hurt the church. The church is just too
strong for that.''

   The child in David Lee Roth is taking plenty

featuring bikini-clad women; and a regulation-size, red, white and
blue Everlast boxing ring.
   But this is no ordinary summer vaction for the shaggy-haired
rock star with the trademark scream. It's a concert tour, and the
playthings are meant to wow audiences for the next nine months in
arenas from Australia to New York.
   ``Music should look like it sounds, no matter what kind of music
it is,'' Roth said in a recent interview. ``A lot of times this
music sounds like something thundering up out of the floorboards or
raining down from the heavens. Sometimes it's like rolling waves of
sound. And what's a wave without somebody to surf it?''
   Despite the props and an endless stream of jokes, Roth is a
shrewd businessman. He knows the gimmicks will bring attention to
his craft _ rock 'n' roll.
   ``There's a lot of aerial tricks, but it's all built around the
music. The band is doing more musical gymnastics than you've ever
heard a rock band do,'' he said.
   Roth, 32, is touring to promote his third solo album,
``Skyscraper.'' The record, which includes the single, ``Just Like
Paradise,'' marks the first time he has tried on the producer's
hat. His tour began on March 4 in Lakeland, Fla.
   ``I wanted to try something different,'' Roth said. ``Always in
the back of my mind I had thought about producing. But I wouldn't
try a flight like this unless I had the tools and the know-how to
do it, and I didn't feel secure with that until fairly recently.''
   The comic book-like showman spoke about his tour, with his long,
blond hair tied back in a ponytail, wearing camouflage pants and a
torn T-shirt, sitting in the second row of his rehearsal hall. He
was careful not to reveal too many of the tour's surprises.
   ``During the band's moment of patriotism, I climb a ladder to
the ceiling of the arena _ Jeez, I don't want to give it all
away,'' he said, but added, ``It's death-defying stuff.''
   Roth's hometown is Bloomington, Ind., but he moved to Pasadena,
Calif., when he was about 12 and has lived there ever since. As a
child, he was inspired by television. He said he figured if all
these people were entertaining him on television, maybe he could be
some kind of entertainer, too.
   The influences which led him to music ran the gamut of groups
and styles.
   ``If I say to you Deep Purple was a big inspiration to me and so
were the Ohio Players, you'd say, `Oh, that's where Dave got his
scream from, Deep Purple!' No, no, no, I got the scream from the
Ohio Players, I got the haircut from Deep Purple.''
   He began his career after meeting Eddie and Alex Van Halen and
Michael Anthony at Pasadena City College. The four formed Van
Halen, a band that set the standard for many heavy-metal bands to
come, especially because of Eddie's innovative guitar playing, and
Roth's wild-man antics.
   The group split up in 1985, and Roth moved on to a solo career.
His new band includes lead guitarist Steve Vai, bass guitarist Matt
Bissonette, drummer Gregg Bissonette and keyboardist Brett Tuggle.
   Roth's international tour will include some of the old Van Halen
standards, in addition to his solo efforts, including a remake of
the Beach Boy's ``California Girls'' and the bluesy ``Just a
Gigolo.''
   In his spare time, Roth climbs mountains, as seen on the ``Just
Like Paradise'' video in which he scales a 3,000-foot-high vertical
wall of granite. He said he may be reverting to his childhood,
because he got the climbing bug when he was a boy scout. Climbing
is a kind of therapy for him.
   ``You know, the most scariest place you can put yourself in has
the most calming effect.''
   Although experienced, he says the hobby has not made him want to
conquer mountains such as Mount Everest.
   ``Something like that is a hyper-commitment,'' he said. ``I need
all of my toes in order to jump around with great abandon.
Inevitably, you're going to lose a finger or a toe on a trip like
that. Somebody checks out early. Taking that kind of risk is not my
interest. The music gives me enough of that kind of adventure.
Fooling around with my career burns enough calories.''
   Roth also fools around with martial arts, receiving a black belt
in karate about nine years ago. At one point he experimented with
kick boxing. These days, he incorporates both disciplines in his
stage show.
   ``Martial arts has a lot of visceral impact. You can feel it _
Pow! And combining it with the music, 10,000 people say, `Oh, did
you feel that?'''
   Despite his devil-may-care manner, Roth is definitely a success.
Two previous albums have sold more that 1 million copies,
certifying them as platinum, and ``Skyscraper'' is well on its way.
This does not include his revenues from the six Van Halen LPs that
share the same honor.
   ``A lot of what stands for success in rock 'n' roll or showbiz
after a while seems like so many little trophies and prizes along
the way,'' he said. ``If there's any real glory to be had it's in
legend.''
   All kidding aside, he insists the money he's made is not for
things, but rather experiences. He said experiences provide better
memories.
   If anything, Roth's whole career is built around making a single
point, getting across a single message:
   ``There's a very definite message in all of this music. People
say, `Dave, what's the message?' That's it. Imagination. Take a
chance. Not just take your best shot, that's too dependable.''

   Improvements in the nation's efficiency in
churning out goods and services slowed by almost half last year
despite revised figures showing higher output in the the fourth
quarter, the government said.
   The Labor Department said Thursday that productivity among
non-farm businesses responsible for three-fourths of the nation's
economic activity rose at an annual rate of 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter in contrast to a deterioration of 0.2 percent
reported in preliminary figures last month.
   The revisions raised the productivity improvement for the entire
year from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent, slightly more than half the
1.6 percent gain of 1986, despite the lowest hourly labor cost
increases in more than four decades.

   Bearish sentiment has sparked a selloff that
sent oil and gasoline futures prices skidding lower.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, contracts for
April delivery of West Intermediate crude oil settled at $15.50 per
42-gallon barrel, down 17 cents. The April contract also declined
in Wednesday's trading.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, April contracts
for wholesale No. 2 heating oil also fell, dropping 1.04 cent to
42.89 cents a gallon, and wholesale unleaded regular gasoline
slipped .50 cent to 44.40 cents a gallon.
   The market rallied during morning trading but was unable to
sustain the advance, said Madison Galbraith, senior energy
specialist with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   There was no news to support the rally, and profit-taking amid
the market's continuing bearish sentiment eroded the advance and
caused prices to continue to fall, Galbraith said.
   Lending some support to the market was trader nervousness about
continuing the selloff below the level of $15.50 for crude,
Galbraith said.

<HEAD>Electricity Sale: ``Trying To Grasp A Porcupine''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's planned sale of the electricity
industry in England and Wales is by far the biggest and most
controversial venture so far in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
huge privatization program.
   Critics predict poorer service and higher prices, and question
the wisdom of putting nuclear power stations in private hands.
   Supporters insist it will produce better service, with
safeguards built on the lessons of past privatizations.
   But investors weighing this debate also harbor big financial
concerns. In the wake of October's stock market crash, Britons
burned by the sell-offs of British Gas PLC and British
Telecommunications PLC shares understandably are wary of buying
into another public utility.
   The stock offering of the electric company _ now a state body
run by the Central Electricity Generating Board _ is to be debated
March 7 in Parliament, and the Energy Department already is taking
steps to fend off criticism.
   ``Privatizing the electricity industry has been likened to
trying to grasp a porcupine,'' the Sunday Times commented.
   The complex sale will take two to three years and could raise
more money than the entire 16.5 billion pounds, or about $29
billion, raised from all the other state-owned companies sold since
Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives were elected in 1979 promising to
roll back socialism in Britain.
   The City, London's financial district, expects the electricity
sale to raise from $26 billion to $47 billion.
   Less controversial have been the sales of non-utility companies,
such as British Airways PLC and Rolls-Royce PLC, the airplane
engine maker.
   Mrs. Thatcher's goal has been to make these companies more
competitive and to get more Britons to become shareholders. The
share-owning public has tripled to 8.5 million in 10 years, the
government says.
   ``The objections have been to the privatization of monopolies
intact without the intention of introducing competition,'' said
Dieter Helm, a research fellow at the London Business School.
   Critics also complain that British Gas and British Telecom were
insufficiently regulated when they went private in 1986 and 1984
respectively. Consequently, they claim, gas and telephone prices
have risen while service has deteriorated.
   Some Britons also say they feel less secure without government
control over such vital public services. In the electricity sale,
critics fear higher prices, deteriorating service and poor security
for nuclear stations. Labor unions fear job losses.
   Helm said there also were questions over whether the capital
markets could absorb all the stock to be sold.
   Moreover, he said, nuclear disasters in recent years at Three
Mile Island in the United States and at the Chernobyl plant in the
Soviet Union ``increase uncertainty about whether people really
want to hold shares in this kind of firm.''
   The sale is opposed by Lord Marshall, chairman of the Central
Electricity Generating Board, who says the plan is unlikely to
serve the consumer's interests.
   Lawmaker John Prescott of the opposition Labor Party attacked
the plan as ``a triumph of ideology over common sense,'' and
accused the government of selling off assets to finance tax cuts.
   The government structured the sale defensively, addressing some
of the issues raised by the gas and phone selloffs. It set up two
competing generating companies and promised to implement regulation
that will protect Britain's security and consumers' rights.
   For example, Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson plans rebates for
dissatisfied consumers _ a privilege not granted to British Telecom
users.
   Tony Boorman, deputy director of the watchdog Electricity
Consumers' Council, called regulatory safeguards ``a welcome
change.''
   ``We've always believed that at least in the short term, the
structure of the industry has less relevance to the customer than
the regulation,'' he said.

<HEAD>20,000 New Hotel Rooms Planned As Vegas Resort Industry Booms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 30 years ago, Life magazine
took a look at the burgeoning little desert town of Las Vegas and
wondered if it wasn't overbuilt.
   The year was 1955 and five new resort hotels had just opened,
prompting the magazine to question where they would get people to
fill them.
   ``Has Las Vegas pushed its luck too far?'' Life asked.
   History has proven doubters to be wrong. Las Vegas has grown
from a dusty town of a few resorts into a booming metropolis of
more than 600,000 people, with nearly 60,000 hotel and motel rooms
to accomodate tourists.
   Now, as Las Vegas undergoes one of the most ambitious of its
periodic building booms, there are few who believe that
overbuilding is a problem. Tourism is growing and the gaming and
resort industries are attempting to capitalize on the trend.
   ``There is still a tremendous amount of demand out there that
hasn't been satisified,'' said Rossi Ralenkotter, director of
marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
``We're in a very strong growth pattern and all indications are
that it will continue.''
   Nearly 20,000 new hotel rooms either are under construction or
awaiting groundbreaking, as resorts compete to add rooms they hope
will bring in even more tourists and gamblers in the near future.
   Part of that optimism is based on figures showing hotels
averaged 90.2 percent occupancy during 1987. Such extremely high
rates meant potential guests often were turned away by a lack of
rooms: on weekends, it is nearly impossible to get a room and on
three-day holiday weekends it's even worse.
   Visitor volume nearly has doubled in the last 12 years, with an
estimated 17 million tourists each expected to spend an average of
2-3 days in Las Vegas during 1988.
   Gaming revenues kept pace, growing 14 percent in 1987 to a
record $2.74 billion in southern Nevada.
   ``We're penetrating markets we've never penetrated before,''
said Dave Verbon, publicity director at the Riviera Hotel. ``There
are vast numbers of people out there we never tried to reach before
and now we're going after them and getting them.''
   Already boasting the world's two largest resort hotels, Las
Vegas soon will have five hotel-casinos with more than 3,000 rooms
apiece. Two resorts _ the Riviera and the Flamingo Hilton _ are
about to begin work on expansions that will bring them to more than
4,000 rooms apiece.
   The Riviera opened a new 1,000-room highrise March 1 and plans
to begin construction of a 1,700-room tower in the fall.
   ``You have to build towers to have a very high volume of
business to drive a large casino with a large number of slot
machines and blackjack tables,'' said Verbon. ``We think there are
enough potential customers to support these huge hotels.''
   The centerpiece of the new construction is the Golden Nugget, a
massive resort rising from a desert parcel adjacent to Caesars
Palace. When finished sometime late next year, the $550 million
resort will have 3,200 guest rooms set in a watery tropical setting
that hotel officials claim will be like nothing Las Vegas has ever
seen.
   ``It's really on a completely different plane in terms of what
we presently have,'' said Nugget President Bobby Baldwin. ``It's
very difficult to compare the new Nugget to anything.''
   Baldwin says he has few worries that the Nugget will be able to
fill its rooms with gamblers and tourists. The company's downtown
resort regularly sells out its rooms.
   ``We're very bullish,'' he said. ``Tour and travel continues to
grow and the individual traveler market continues to expand,
particularly from Southern California. International business has
also expanded in the last few months and we hope to see that
continue.''
   The tourism economy has been helped by the growth in three-day
weekends and a national trend toward mini-vacations of 2-3 days.
Las Vegas has also been very successful in landing conventions,
which attracted 1.6 million people to the city in 1987.
   Part of the Las Vegas lure also comes from room rates that
average $45 a night, far below the $100 or more charged by
non-gaming hotels in other cities.
   ``It's the bargain aspect, the ability to have a very enjoyable
convention or vacation visit at far less expense than any other
destination,'' said Ralenkotter.
   The city's hotels in the past four to five years have begun
exploiting the vast middle-class and tourism markets they once
eschewed in favor of attracting a handful of high-rolling gamblers.
   The expanded customer base, hotel operators believe, gives them
protection against a recession or sudden rise in fuel prices that
could have a negative impact on tourism levels.
   In the early 1980s, a national recession combined with high fuel
prices and the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City stopped
the Las Vegas growth rate in its tracks.
   ``In good times everybody does pretty well and the better
operators do even better,'' said Baldwin. ``In bad times good
operators don't do quite as well but they still do well. The best
operators do great in both times.''

   The best-liked commercials of 1987 included some
starring performances from animated characters such as dancing clay
raisins, a hamburger chain's moonman and a pizza company's dreaded
foil called a Noid.
   Few of the commercials mentioned most often by consumers polled
by Video Storyboard Tests Inc. featured traditional show business
celebrities, the head of the consumer research firm said Thursday.
   ``We seem to heading into a period when we see more created
celebrities, not necessarily human beings, in commercials,'' said
David Vadehra, president of Video Storyboard, in relasing the
results of the firm's 10th annual survey.
   He said that may be partly due to growing dissatisfaction with
the costs and risks associated with using celebrities. The trend
occurs even as admakers for some cars, office phone systems,
computers and insurance products have tried to replicate realistic
situations and dialogue in their commercials.
   Video Storyboard, which is based in New York, interviewed more
than 25,000 people about what commercials they liked best last year.
   Leading the list was the campaign for California raisins, which
used clay models of raisins dancing to the sounds of Motown music
in a construction worker's lunchbox and across the kitchen counter.
   The ads took top billing despite relatively modest spending of
$5.4 million to put them on television. The survey said makers of
other well-liked ads spent as much as $344 million (McDonald's
Corp.) on television placements.
   Second was Bud Light beer commercials, many of which featured
the English bull terrier Spuds MacKenzie while others offered
numerous variations of what can go wrong if you simply order a
``light'' without specifying the brand.
   The ad campaign for Pepsi soft drinks placed third, and Miller
Lite beer commercials were fourth.
   Ads for McDonald's restaurants came in fifth. The campaign
included some commercials that featured a piano-playing character
shaped like a moon crescent who extolled dinner at McDonald's to
the tune from ``Mac the Knife.''
   The stars of sixth-ranked Bartles & Jaymes wine cooler ads are a
pair of non-actors who were persuaded to pose as the brand's owners.
   Ads for Coca-Cola soft drinks, which placed seventh, include
some with the computer-generated character Max Headroom.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ads for Isuzu automobiles, DuPont
carpeting and Domino's Pizza, which features an animated clay
character called the Noid.
   Consumers didn't turn completely sour on celebrity-filled ads.
Jell-O dessert ads with actor Bill Cosby placed 11th. But Cosby
couldn't keep Kodak film from dropping off the list of the 25 most
popular campaigns.
   Another casualty in 1987 was Burger King advertising, which fell
out of the top 25 for the first time in five years with advertising
billing it as ``The Best Food for Fast Times.'' The chain recently
dumped the theme, changed ad agencies and is pitching the taste of
its flame-broiled hamburgers in new ads.
   Another hamburger chain, Wendy's, placed 12th with an ad
campaign that spoofed taste tests by having customers pick a
pre-cooked hamburger over a freshly cooked Wendy's burger for some
very strange reasons.
   Next were campaigns for Levi's jeans, Kibbles 'n Bits dog food,
Seagrams wine coolers, Michelob beer and Oscar Meyer meats.
   The Partnership for Drug-Free America, a campaign aimed at
discouraging illegal drug use, was the first public service
campaign to place in the top 25, finishing 18th.
   Rounding out the top 25 were ads for Chevrolet cars, Lucky Dog
dog food, Angel Soft tissue, Energizer batteries, Sprite soft
drinks, Tender Chops dog food and Long John Silver restaurants.

   Koppers Co. Inc., a huge construction and
chemicals concern, has offered no reply to an unsolicited $1.3
billion takeover bid from a group led by a major British
contruction company and a U.S. investment firm.
   But traders on Wall Street seem to think the bidding might go
higher, and sent the price of Koppers' stock well above the $45 a
share offer.
   Koppers rose $6.62{ a share to close at $51.75 on Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange. It was the sixth most-actively traded
stock with 3.1 million shares changing hands.
   The tender offer for Koppers was launched Thursday by a concern
called BNS Inc., whose biggest shareholder is Beazer PLC, a
London-based general construction company that owns 49 percent of
BNS.
   Other participants in BNS are subsidiaries of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., a New York-based investment firm that reportedly owns
about 46 percent of BNS, and NatWest Investment Bank Ltd., a
British investment bank.
   Affiliates of BNS already own nearly 2.1 million shares, or
about 7.45 percent of Koppers' outstanding common stock, the
company said.
   Based on Koppers' nearly 28.6 million common shares outstanding,
the tender offer would be worth a total of about $1.29 billion.
   Several securities analysts said Koppers, which recently
completed a restructuring that shed several engineering and metals
products businesses over the past three years, was worth more than
the offered price.
   Its main businesses now are construction materials and services,
which mainly involve road construction, and chemical and allied
products.
   BNS indicated that it planned to sell the chemicals and allied
products business if its tender offer is successful.
   Robert Kanters, senior vice president for the stock brokerage
Legg Mason Masten in Pittsburgh, said Koppers holds ``a commanding
position in aggregates and the coal-based chemicals businesses''
and may be worth $55- to $60-a-share.
   Aggregates are the rock mixtures used in road and bridge
construction. Among Koppers' coal-based chemicals products are
substances used to treat lumber.
   Fred Siemer, who follows the chemicals business for the firm
Chemical Research, said Beazer probably is attracted to Koppers'
quarries, which are essential to roadbuilding. Koppers said it
operates about 150 quarries in 20 states.
   Beazer has been expanding rapidly in recent years. It bought
Gifford-Hill & Co., a cement-maker based in Dallas, in 1986; and
also operates Phillips Builders in Nashville, Tenn., Tidewater
Construction Co. in Norfolk, Va., and Cohn Communities in Atlanta.
   The bid is conditioned on, among other things, Koppers
stockholders tendering a majority of the company's common shares,
approval by the non-management directors of Koppers, approval by
Beazer's shareholders and the bidding group's satisfaction that
certain elements of Delaware antitakeover laws are invalid.
   The offer expires at midnight March 30 unless extended.
   Brian C. Beazer, chairman of Beazer PLC, told Koppers' chairman,
Charles R. Pullin, in a letter, ``We plan to operate Koppers as an
independent autonomous business and we have no plans to move the
headquarters from Pittsburgh.''
   BNS said Shearson had agreed to provide $465 million in
financing for the offer and that Citibank had indicated to arrange
additional financing.
   Koppers reported its profit for 1987 fell to $10.2 million, or
36 cents share, from $74.1 million, or $2.59 a share, a year
earlier. The results included a charge of $59.4 million in 1987 due
to settlement of a lawsuit.
   Revenue rose to $1.52 billion from $1.4 billion in 1986.
   Beazer said it earned $82.8 million on sales of $1.7 billion in
its latest fiscal year, which ended last June 30.

<HEAD>Major Retailers Disappointed by February Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest general retailers recorded lower than
expected sales in February, prompting analysts to underscore their
predictions of an economic slowdown this year.
   Retailers in all market segments, from discount chains like K
mart Corp. to the more upscale Federated Department Stores Inc.,
said Thursday that their sales suffered last month. Many companies
reported sales declines.
   ``The results do not bode well for the economy,'' said Fred
Wintzer, a retail industry analyst for the investment firm Alex.
Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   Cautious spending, Wintzer said, could have a ripple effect
throughout the economy. Consumer spending is the largest component
of the gross national product, and when spending is sluggish
retailers order less merchandise and manufacturers in turn cut back
production, sometimes causing layoffs.
   Laid off workers then decrease their spending, sustaining the
cycle.
   Consumers have been spending slowly for about a year, and
analysts predicted the trend would continue despite an expected
pickup in sales before Easter.
   ``After that, we would expect to see a return to slowing or
sluggish trends at least for the next few months,'' said Jeffrey B.
Edelman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., said consumers were expected to increase their savings this
year as a hedge against economic uncertainty.
   February generally is one of the weakest months of the retail
year, but last month's results were ``disappointing and
significantly below expectations for most retail companies,'' said
Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc.
   The figures ``appear to be miserable,'' but may look worse than
they really are because of comparisons with a strong performance by
retailers in February 1987, Edelman said.
   The nation's largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., said its
sales rose 2.5 percent from February 1987.
   K mart said its overall sales were up 0.8 percent, but sales at
stores open at least a year _ known as comparable store sales _
fell 1.6 percent.
   Comparable store sales are considered a more accurate reflection
of a retailer's performance than overall sales.
   The rapidly-expanding Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported its overall
sales rose 32 percent while comparable store sales rose 13 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said its sales fell 0.5 percent overall and
1.1 percent among comparable stores.
   Federated, the object of a takeover battle between R.H. Macy &
Co. Inc. and Campeau Corp., said its sales slipped 1.2 percent.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales rose 16.2 percent,
but comparable store sales slipped 1.3 percent during February.
   May Department Stores Co. said its overall sales fell 1.3
percent while comparable store sales dropped 4.5 percent.
   Montgomery Ward & Co. said its sales declined 2.5 percent and
F.W. Woolworth Co. said its sales rose 9.4 percent.
   The results reported Thursday were from general retailers and
apparel stores. They do not reflect sales of auto dealers or
supermarkets.
   Apparel retailers, who have been among the hardest hit by
sluggish sales, are unlikely to see much relief during the first
half of this year, Wintzer said.
   Last summer, consumers became bored with fashions and cut back
their clothing purchases through the fall and winter. When sales
began to decline, it was too late for retailers to change spring
1988 merchandise that was similar to the 1987 styles, so consumers
are not expected to greet the new lines
   Retailers are testing new fashions in hopes of turning their
performance around later this year, Wintzer said.

<HEAD>Domestic Car and Truck Sales Jump 25 Percent in Late February</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Auto Sales-Table</HEAD>

   General Motors Corp. benefited from an apparent
resurgence of consumer confidence in late February, analysts said,
leading a spurt that saw domestic automakers post a 25 percent rise
in sales over the year-ago period.
   In the seven selling days from Feb. 21-29, GM sold 127,549
domestic cars, up 33.4 percent from a year earlier, and 59,709
domestic light trucks, up 46.2 percent from a year earlier.
   GM said its sales during the final third of February were its
highest for that period since 1972.
   Among all eight companies that build cars and trucks in the
United States, sales totaled 378,308 in late February, up from
302,642 a year ago.
   Aiding sales were the weaker dollar, which pushes prices of
imports higher, and what some analysts said was stronger consumer
activity.
   ``Consumer confidence continues to strengthen and is now
approaching levels prior to the October stock market collapse. We
are optimistic about the (vehicle) market for March and the spring
selling season,'' said C.N. Moore, GM vice president for customer
sales and service.
   Domestic car sales totaled 246,742 during late February, up 24.1
percent from 198,818 a year ago. Domestic light truck sales were
131,566, up 26.7 percent from 103,824 in late February 1987, the
companies reported.
   For the entire month, combined import car and light truck sales
fell 4.4 percent from February 1987 while sales of domestic
vehicles rose 13.9 percent. Higher prices helped push sales of
Japanese cars 4.1 percent lower and European cars 6.1 percent lower
against a year ago.
   Foreign automakers have been forced to raise prices to account
for the foreign exchange decline of the dollar since 1985.
   ``The domestics are going after market share...starting to take
advantage of the import weakness. Not only have they held down
prices, but they have very heavy incentive campaigns,'' said Thomas
O'Grady, industry analyst with Integrated Automotive Resources Inc.
in Wayne, Pa.
   Total car and light truck sales, imported and domestic, rose
17.7 percent in February to 2,406,215 from 2,044,426 a year ago.
Sales are compared on the basis of daily average sales during
February, which had 25 selling days this year and 24 last year.
   Korean car sales rose 76.4 percent, continuing an unbroken trend
that began when Hyundai Motor Corp. entered the market in 1986.
   Unlike the currencies of Japan and most western European
nations, the Korean won has not risen against the U.S. dollar, so
Korean cars remain relatively inexpensive in this country.
   Of the four Korean makes on the market, two are imported by U.S.
makers _ the Ford Festiva and GM's Pontiac LeMans _ and one is
imported by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   In late February, car sales increased from a year ago for all
domestic makers except Nissan Motor Corp., whose sales plunged 44.2
percent to 1,955 from 3,501 a year ago.
   Nissan also was the only domestic maker to sell fewer light
trucks during the period. Nissan's domestic light trucks sales fell
2.5 percent to 2,633 from 2,701 a year ago.
   Ford Motor Co.'s domestic car sales rose 18.7 percent to 61,049
from 51,411 a year ago. Ford's domestic truck sales were up 10.8
percent, to 41,599 from 37,559 a year ago.
   No. 3 Chrysler Corp.'s domestic car sales rose 18.8 percent, to
37,481 from 31,560 a year ago. Chrysler's domestic truck sales rose
21.6 percent, to 27,625 from 22,715 in late February 1987.
   Honda Motor Co., Volkswagen of America Inc. and Toyota Motor
Corp. also reported increased sales from a year ago. Mazda Motor
Corp. began assembling cars in the United States last fall.

   Otis Spunkmeyer Inc. is wagering a
few million cookies that it has Goodyear out-blimped when it comes
to midair advertising.
   The gourmet baking company embarks today on a sky tours business
featuring a vintage 1945 DC-3, hoping to capture the romance of
aviation's golden era along with the hearts and wallets of
well-heeled customers.
   Kenneth Rawlings, chairman and chief executive officer of Otis
Spunkmeyer, sees the tour business as a can't-miss proposition:
even if planefuls of customers don't line up for hour-long flights
at $75 a pop _ or $1,200 to charter the entire 18-seat aircraft _
the promotional value is high.
   ``We look at it as our Goodyear blimp,'' Rawlings said, noting
that a 95-foot-long sign bearing the company's name under the wing
should grab the attention of ground-bound consumers.
   ``We're just trying to find a way of flying it full at the same
time we're promoting our product.''
   The company inaugurated its ``Sentimental Journeys'' venture on
Thursday, whisking press and invited guests on half-hour trips
around San Francisco Bay in the two-propeller airplane, complete
with champagne and crew in 1940s style uniforms.
   Otis Spunkmeyer, which expects $30 million in sales over the
next 12 months, bought the DC-3 for $165,000 two months ago.
   Rawlings took his first airplane ride on a DC-3 as a child and
says he's been mulling over the sky tours idea for some time. Last
summer he decided to go ahead with it after his wife Linda _ the
company president and a white-knuckle flier _ accompanied him on a
commercial DC-3 flight from Cape Cod to Boston and was lulled to
sleep by its comfort.
   Victory Lap Inc., the Spunkmeyer subsidiary that operates the
tours, has spiffed up the inside of its DC-3 and offers deluxe
limousine service as well.
   Inside the plane, crew members wear 1940s-style uniforms, the
in-flight music features Doris Day and Glenn Miller, and
stewardesses distribute champagne, gourmet hors d'oeuvres and _ of
course _ cookies as the slow but steady aircraft flies past the
Golden Gate Bridge at 1,500 feet.
   The DC-3 revolutionized air travel in comfort and safety, and
accounted for 90 percent of the world's airline traffic in 1939.
Rawlings estimates there are more than 1,000 of them still
operating, mostly flying cargo in other countries.
   Aviation historian Ed Davies of nearby Millbrae, Calif., said he
believed the DC-3 venture was the first of its kind.
   If the tours venture is successful, Rawlings envisions a fleet
of refurbished DC-3s serving the nation's major metropolitan areas,
starting with Seattle, San Diego or Los Angeles.
   Such a move would mark a new chapter for San Leandro-based Otis
Spunkmeyer, founded by Rawlings in 1977 as a California chain of
fresh-baked cookie stores. The company moved into selling frozen
gourmet cookie dough wholesale in 1983 and now employs 250 people.

<HEAD>Mexico Announces Results of Debt-for-Bonds Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only about a quarter of Mexico's creditor
banks submitted bids in a unique debt-for-securities swap aimed at
reducing the nation's $105 billion foreign debt, according to the
Treasury Department.
   The government said Thursday it had accepted 55 percent of the
$6.7 billion in bids that 139 creditor banks submittd under the
swap plan, which has been hailed by some as a major new initiative
in dealing with troubled Third World debtors.
   Under the plan, the government will issue over $2.5 billion in
new, 20-year bonds to its creditor banks to replace $3.66 billion
in old bank debt, a swap that will save Mexico over $2.6 billion
over 20 years.
   Mexico had invited its international bank creditors to trade
their Mexican loans at a discount for the 20-year bonds, which are
backed by U.S. Treasury securities.
   The plan unveiled last December was seen as a way of reducing
the banks' exposures to troubled Mexican loans while minimizing the
impact on the banks' ledgers from having to write down the value of
those loans.
   But there were indications when the plan was announced that a
number of major foreign lenders would not participate. Citibank,
for example, indicated it was satisfied with its loan portfolio and
viewed the swaps instead as a way for banks to get out of Third
World lending.
   Mexico's approximately 560 creditor banks had until Feb. 25 to
submit their sealed bids to Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., which acted
as exchange agent for the plan.
   Of the $6.7 billion in bids received from 139 creditor banks,
Mexico accepted bids representing $3.66 billion in old loans at an
average discount exchange rate of just over 69 cents on the dollar,
the Treasury Department said.
   The remaining 45 percent of the bids were rejected because they
sought a price for the old debt that was higher than that sought by
the government, the department said.
   By agreeing to issue the $2.557 billion in new bonds, Mexico
will reduce its debt principal by $1.108 billion. It also will save
$1.537 billion in interest over the 20-year term of the bonds, for
a total savings of $2.645 billion.
   The government will back the bond issue by buying $520 million
in zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds. It had been prepared to invest
up to $2 billion to purchase up to $10 billion of the U.S.
securities.
   The department did not identify the banks which had bids
accepted or detail the amounts.
   It did state that the government would continue ``to actively
explore new mechanisms to reduce its external debt.''
   ``It is hoped that in the future...international financial
organizations can play a more active role in designing and
assisting other solutions to alleviate the weight of the debt,''
the department stated.

<TEXT>
   Robert J. Birnbaum is stepping down as president
and chief operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange when his
contract expires at the end of May and will be succeeded by
executive vice president Richard A. Grasso.
   Birnbaum, 60, who became NYSE president in 1985 after eight
years as president of the American Stock Exchange, said in a
statement Thursday that he is ``interested in pursuing other
interests and opportunities,'' including membership on corporate
boards and possibly an association with a major law firm.
   His successor, Grasso, 41, is a 20-year veteran of the NYSE who
has served as its executive vice president for capital markets
since 1986 and is a member of the exchange's management committee.
   There was no indication that Birnbaum's departure was related to
the Oct. 19 stock market collapse, when the NYSE was strained to
the breaking point by the plunge in prices and an unprecedented
volume of trading.
   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. stated that ``Bob Birnbaum has
been a valuable asset to the New York Stock Exchange during one of
the most turbulent periods in its history.
   ``His many years of experience in operations and extensive
knowledge of securities industry issues contributed significantly
to the NYSE's ability to operate smoothly and efficiently during
the market crisis,'' Phelan said.
   Grasso is known for his expertise with the exchange's computers
and communications systems, which are becoming increasingly
critical. He is responsible for upgrades of the systems that will
allow the NYSE to manage volume of 600 million shares a day by June
as efficiently as it manages 225 million shares currently.
   In an interview, Grasso said the exchange is working with member
firms to remove bottlenecks so that the whole trading system will
be able to handle 600 million shares a day _ the record volume of
last Oct. 19 and 20.
   ``I can't give you the categorical statement that all 600 member
firms will be at the point where we will be by June, but progress
is being made,'' Grasso said.
   Phelan said in a statement that ``it is imperative that the
president and chief operating officer of the NYSE be thoroughly
familiar with these systems.''
   The NYSE said Grasso was designated by the board of directors on
Thursday and would be formally elected on June 2.

<HEAD>Big Carriers Hike Fares Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unexpected strength in passenger traffic during
a typically weak travel season has prompted major airlines to raise
fares twice in recent weeks.
   Continental Airlines initiated the latest move on Thursday,
boosting one-way regular coach fares in amounts ranging from $7 for
short flights to $45 for longer trips.
   Continental also tightened restrictions on some of its discount
fares used by business travelers, effective March 15. They will
have to book tickets four to seven days in advance and pay a 25
percent cancellation or change penalty.
   American, United and Northwest airlines immediately announced
they would match Continental's regular coach-fare increases in
markets where they compete. Other carriers were expected to do
likewise.
   Under the revised fare structure, for example, a one-way regular
coach ticket from New York to Denver rose from $350 to $395. A
one-way coach ticket from Newark, N.J., to Rochester, N.Y rose from
$118 to $125.
   Last month, airlines raised their deepest discount fares by
about $10 per round trip, partly because of surprisingly higher
passenger traffic. In January airline traffic rose about 4 percent,
more than most industry analysts had expected. February traffic
also appeared to be strong.
   American, for example, reported a 25.7 percent jump in passenger
traffic for the month over a year earlier and said it flew a record
4.61 billion revenue passenger miles. A revenue passenger mile
represents one paying passenger flown one mile, an important
measurement of an airline's business. Continental said February
traffic increased 8.8 percent over a year earlier.
   Airline traffic ordinarily slows in the winter, which prompts
carriers to woo travelers with fare-cuts. Concern about a winter
slump intensified after the October stock market crash, which
raised fears that leisure and business travel would decline.
   Industry analysts have attributed the surprisingly strong growth
in airline traffic to eased concern about the impact of the stock
crash. They also say the dollar's lower value has attracted
thousands of Europeans to the United States, where they can exploit
the buying power of their stronger currencies.
   The fare increases announced Thursday helped boost airline
stocks on Wall Street, reflecting an investor belief that earnings
would benefit if greater numbers of passengers are paying more
money to fly.
   Delta Air Lines rose 87{ cents to $48.87{; AMR, parent of
American, rose $2.12{ to $42.12{; NWA, parent of Northwest, rose
$1.12{ to $44.75, and Allegis, parent of United, rose $1.25 to $77.

<TEXT>
   Batus Inc. said it launched a $4.5
billion hostile tender offer for Farmers Group Inc. because the
insurance giant's board of directors declined to negotiate over
Batus' earlier $4.2 billion proposal.
   Batus began the $63 a share offer on Thursday, sweetening its
initial unsolicited $60 a share proposal that Farmers had rejected
on Jan. 20 as inadequate.
   A spokesman for Los Angeles-based Farmers, the nation's
seventh-largest insurer, said that while the Farmers board would
consider the higher price, ``this highly conditional offer changes
very little.''
   Wall Street reacted to the latest development by sending the
price of Farmers' stock up 75 cents _ to $62.75 per share _ on the
over-the-counter market.
   In a statement, Batus Chairman Patrick Sheehy said the tender
offer ``represents a pemium of 47 percent over the $43 price at
which Farmers' shares closed on the day before our initial
proposal.''
   He said Batus would be willing to meet Farmers' directors at any
time to discuss all terms of the proposal.
   One New York analyst, who has followed the maneuvering, said
Batus' latest attempt ``may be a ploy to get some action out of
Farmers. They have been sitting there ignoring everything that is
done.''
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see a further offer down the
line,'' said D. Gordon Luce, of Brown Brothers Harriman.
   Other analysts had said previously that Batus needed to sweeten
its offer by $5 to $20 a share before Farmers would consider it.
   The tender offer was conditioned upon Batus obtaining at least
51 percent of Farmers' 69 million outstanding shares and on Batus
gaining required state regulatory approval. The offer expires March
30.
   Batus is a subsidiary of British-based BAT Industries PLC, a
tobacco, retailing and insurance conglomerate.
   Batus announced last month that it had lined up a $3.2 billion
revolving line of credit from an international group of banks for
use in its takeover bid.
   After rejecting Batus's $60 a share offer, Farmers Chairman Leo
Denlea Jr. said his shareholders would be best served if the
company remained independent.
   Farmers has about $11 billion in assets, mostly in insurance. It
ranks third in the United States in home and auto insurance behind
State Farm and Allstate and is the seventh-largest property and
casualty insurance company.

<HEAD>Minority Group of Company Directors Files New Suit Against
Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five directors of KaiserTech Ltd. have
filed suit against Alan Clore, the company's chairman, to keep him
from turning over control of the board to Houston financier Charles
Hurwitz.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Alameda County Superior Court,
was the second against Clore involving KaiserTech in three days. On
Tuesday, the world's fifth-largest aluminum maker sued the British
investor for illegal insider stock trading.
   Among the minority group of directors that sued Clore on
Thursday was retired Kaiser Chairman Cornell Maier. The suit said
that Clore's resignation ``is in order'' because of an alleged
breach of contract.
   Clore agreed earlier this week to sell his 32.1 percent stake in
KaiserTech for up to $234 million to Hurwitz, who acquired Pacific
Lumber Co. in 1986.
   The five directors wanted Clore to sell his shares more broadly.
They also are concerned that all board positions expire in May.
   The minority directors claim Clore has breached the so-called
Clore Agreement, which gave Clore the right to nominate a majority
of the board in exchange for a $140 million investment last year.
   They said in the lawsuit that ``driven by his financial
desperation and (in) violation of Delaware law and his agreement
with KaiserTech, Clore has entered into agreements with Hurwitz
under which Clore will pretend to nominate his own (slate of
directors), but in fact will nominate only those Hurwitz selects.''
   ``In plain English,'' the suit continued, ``the foregoing
agreements and schemes are a sham designed to enable Hurwitz to
obtain board control, all without stockholder approval.''
   Clore and his lawyers could not be reached for comment on the
suit. A representative for Hurwitz, not a defendant in the
complaint, said the suit is ``without merit.''
   Besides Maier, those suing include Stephen Hutchcraft, corporate
president under Maier and now president of KaiserTech's only
operating subsidiary, Kaiser Aluminum; John Beckett, retired
Transamerica Corp. chairman and the BankAmerica Corp. director who
helped persuade Tom Clausen to return as chairman of the San
Francisco-based bank corporation; Charles Lynch, chairman of DHL
Worldwide Express in Redwood City; and John Merow, Kaiser's former
vice chairman. All but Lynch were directors under Maier.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that Trans
World Airlines did not bargain in bad faith to precipitate and
prolong a 1986 strike by flight attendants, a decision that could
save the airline $300 million.
   The ruling Thursday went against the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants, which represents about 5,000 TWA flight
attendants who were seeking reinstatement with back pay to the jobs
they lost in the strike.
   U.S. District Judge Howard F. Sachs rejected contentions by the
union that TWA and its largest shareholder, Carl Icahn, bargained
in bad faith in violation of federal labor laws to precipitate the
bitter 72-day walkout. The union demanded its jobs back with back
pay at prestrike wage rates.
   Union President Vicki Frankovich said she was disappointed by
the judge's ruling but was ``confident we will win on appeal.''
   If Sachs' order is upheld upon appeal, it will lift from the
airline a potential financial liability that has been accumulating
at the rate of $8 million to $15 million a month since the strike
began March 7, 1986.
   ``We are very pleased the court made this decision,'' Icahn
said. ``We try to be fair to our employees. We tried to negotiate
with IFFA. We are happy the court vindicated us.''
   Icahn said the decision would not alter TWA's financial plans
because ``we never put any reserves aside because we always thought
we could win it.''
   The walkout began after Icahn bargained unsuccessfully for
cost-saving concessions from the union. Freed from the supervision
of a federal mediator who could not resolve the differences, Icahn
cut flight attendant wages by 22 percent, increased working hours
and changed work rules. The union struck.
   TWA hired 2,700 new flight attendants to replace the strikers.
About 1,300 attendants resigned from the union, crossed its picket
lines and continued to work.
   On May 17, 1986, the union offered unconditionally to return to
work without a contract.
   In one of several lawsuits it filed, the union alleged that the
airline had bargained in bad faith to bring about and prolong the
strike.
   While chastising both sides for their sometimes angry and
abrasive conduct in negotiations _ particularly Icahn for allegedly
sexist comments _ Sachs found that the actions of the airline were
legal responses to economic conditions.
   ``I cannot conclude from the evidence presented that TWA's
bargaining was in bad faith,'' the judge wrote in his 78-page
opinion.
   Sachs said case law permitted an aggressive union to bargain for
benefits that will increase an employer's costs. An aggressive
employer can lawfully bargain for reductions in total expenses of a
group thought to be considerably overpaid and much less productive
than is feasible, he said.
   Sachs went on to say that ``it is not a function of the court to
insist that an employer cheerfully accept strike losses or show
generosity in victory.''

   A flight attendants' union official said today
that Transportation Department plans to test airline crews and
ground workers for drug use would be unfair and unnecessary.
   But Transportation Secretary James Burnley defended the proposal
announced Thursday, saying he did not want to wait until hundreds
of people are killed before taking action to stop any potential
problem.
   Vicky Francovich, president of the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants, said that in the 50-year history of the
industry, there have been no accidents blamed on employee drug use.
   Ms. Francovich, interviewed with Burnley on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America,'' said the department should be looking for ways
to combat fatigue among overworked airline personnel and to tighten
certification procedures.
   ``I think there are more responsible ways to deal with the
problems,'' she said, adding that false positive drug tests could
lead to an unfair stigma against an employee.
   ``While the government is not dealing with problems in the
deregulated industry ... it is attacking a problem here that
doesn't really exist,'' she said. ``This is not a necessary
approach.''
   Burnley acknowledged that no airline accidents have been traced
to drug use, but he cited a Pittsburgh Press survey showing that
six hospital emergency rooms had treated 23 cockpit crew members or
flight attendants for drug overdoses.
   Burnley, who was also interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said
one airline reported that 16 percent of job applicants for
mechanics jobs were found to be using drugs and, at another
airline, 6 percent of flight attendant applicants were drug users.
He did not name the airlines.
   ``There is nothing beyond that anecdotal evidence that would
indicate that the airline industry is somehow exempt from this
problem that is plaguing all of American society, so I think it's
pretty clear that we need to move in this area,'' he said.
   Burnley said he expects a final rule to be implemented before
the end of the year, despite several pending court challenges to
mandatory drug testing.
   Testing would cover the more than half a million commercial
aviation employees who hold safety-senstive jobs: from pilots and
flight attendants to mechanics and security workers at airport
checkpoints.
   A fact sheet provided by the department suggested as many as 7.5
percent of the 511,000 workers who would be subject to the tests
might show evidence of drug use. But Burnley sought to distance
himself from the estimate, saying it was included only as a means
of roughly estimating the possible cost of such a program and not
meant to indicate the extent of drug use in the industry.
   The pilots and otherairline unions promised to challenge any
random drug testing rule in court once it is made final. Drug
testing already is the subject of numerous lawsuits and several
federal courts of appeal have either upheld testing or knocked it
down.
   ``We can't wait for weeks and months while these (drug testing)
cases wind themselves through the courts,'' Burnley said.
   In addition to pilots and flight attendants, the testing
requirements would cover aircraft mechanics, other cockpit crew
member such as flight engineers and navigators, aircraft
dispatchers and security personnel who work at screening
checkpoints at airports.
   Under the proposal, employees would be subject to a
pre-employment test, periodic testing whenever a person is taking a
physical, post-accident testing and random testing as well as test
for reasonable cause. An employee would be subject to an initial
test on a sample of urine and a more sophisticated test if the
first test shows the presence of drugs.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Fell 27.4 Percent In January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan posted an unadjusted current account surplus
of $3.52 billion in January, down 27.4 percent from $4.84 billion a
year earlier, the Finance Ministry said Friday.
   January's surplus in the broadest measure of trade was also down
from $9.44 billion in December, said Finance Ministry official
Toshio Naito. The current account includes services and investment
income as well as merchandise trade.
   When adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the current account
surplus for January stood at $8.03 billion, down from $8.71 billion
a year earlier but up from an adjusted $7.47 billion in December.
   Japan's seasonally adjusted trade surplus in January fell 19.6
percent from its level a year earlier, marking the seventh
consecutive monthly decline, Naito.
   The seasonally adjusted surplus in merchandise trade, a narrower
measure, came to $4.58 billion, down from $5.70 billion last
January and $10.06 billion in December, Naito said. It was the
seventh straight monthly decline in the trade surplus compared to
its year-earlier level.
   Imports of aluminum, platinum, textiles, food and crude oil
increased, apparently because of the yen's continued rise against
the U.S. dollar and stronger domestic demand, Naito said. The
higher yen has raised prices of Japanese exports overseas and made
imports cheaper, encouraging Japanese to buy more foreign goods.
   In 1987's January-March quarter, the current account surplus
rose 65.5 percent from a year earlier. On the other hand, it
declined 1.5 percent in the April-June quarter year-on-year, 13.2
percent in the July-September quarter and 15.2 percent in the
October-December quarter.
   Exports rose 16.1 percent in January from a year earlier to
$17.0 billion, compared to $14.6 billion a year earlier, but down
from the holiday-impacted $22.8 billion in December.
   Imports rose 38.8 percent to $12.4 billion from $8.94 billion a
year earlier.
   Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist for Sumitomo Bank Ltd., said
January's unadjusted 16.1 percent surge in exports was ``somewhat
disturbing.''
   Kakimoto said Japanese exporters, in part, had boosted their
shipments in December and January on fears the yen would rise
against the dollar and make their products less competitive.
   In a separate report, the Japan Automobile Importers'
Association said imported cars sold in Japan reached 8,212 autos in
February, up 39.4 percent from the 5,890 sold in the same month
last year.
   The number of imported autos sold in Japan has increased every
month since January 1984, said Kunihiko Ono of the association.

   A massive protest and other strong opposition
from the United Auto Workers union influenced Chrysler Corp.'s
decision not to sell its Acustar Inc. parts-making subsidiary, the
automaker says.
   Chrysler said Thursday it would keep Acustar, but would close or
sell four plants within the next 18 months because of their
``competitive position.''
   The UAW had threatened plant-by-plant strikes if Chrysler sold
the subsidiary, which employs 28,000 in the United States, Canada
and Mexico and had $3 billion in sales last year.
   Last Thursday, more than 1,000 sign-waving workers protested the
proposed sale outside Chrysler's Highland Park headquarters.
   Furthermore, workers at Chrysler plants throughout the No. 3
automaker also had stopped attending management-union meetings and
participating in other joint activities since the automaker
disclosed the possible sale.
   ``That played a role,'' Chrysler spokesman John Guiniven said of
the company's decision. ``(Workers) stated very strongly that they
wanted to remain a part of Chrysler.''
   Chrysler had said it was considering selling the subsidiary,
which represents a fifth of its worldwide operations, because it
didn't want to invest in the research needed to upgrade some
operations. Chrysler already buys about 70 percent of its parts
from outside sources.
   The UAW had opposed the sale of Acustar on the grounds that it
would threaten the job security of all Chrysler workers.
   ``We looked at all the offers, took into account the feelings of
our employees and decided not to sell,'' Guiniven said.
   ``We certainly welcome this announcement, since we have
maintained all along that Chrysler is a stronger company with its
own internal parts-making capacity,'' UAW President Owen Bieber and
UAW Vice President Marc Stepp said in joint statement.
   Chrysler said the four plants it plans to close or sell _ Amplex
Van Wert in Van Wert, Ohio, Trenton Chemical in suburban Detroit,
Detroit Forge and Detroit Trim _ employ about 2,000 workers.
   The largest of the four plants is Detroit Trim, which employs
1,177 workers and makes trim for automobiles.
   Trenton Chemical employs 189 and makes chemicals used in auto
paints, Amplex Van Vert employs 333 and makes powered metal
products and Detroit Forge employs 419 and makes forged parts.
   ``We are going to sell all four and if not, they will be
closed,'' Guiniven said. ``But we feel strongly that Ampex and
Trenton Chemical will be sold.''
   The union would not have been able to call a national strike
over the sale of Acustar, but union locals were given permission to
authorize strikes on a plant-by-plant basis over unresolved issues
such as health and safety grievances.
   At least seven locals had voted to ask for strike authorization,
including workers at Trenton Chemical. Workers also had stopped
participating in union-management meetings at plants throughout
Chrysler in protest.
   Chrysler said it expected the company-union joint activities
suspended last month would resume in the wake of its decision.
   Bieber and Stepp said they believed workers who had stayed away
from the meetings probably would begin cooperating as a result of
the decision.
   The company also said it was ready to open negotiations for a
national contract to replace the agreement that expires Sept. 14.
   Stepp said Thursday he would recommend to the union's 140-member
Chrysler council that negotiations, which normally begin in
midsummer, be started early this year.
   ``It surprised me a bit that they offered to open talks early,
but I'm, very interested in getting a new agreement like Ford and
GM that covers workers being laid off by plant closings,'' Stepp
said Thursday night.
   Harley Shaiken, a professor and labor relations expert at the
University of California at San Diego, said Chrysler misjudged its
workers when it said Acustar was up for sale.
   ``Chrysler miscalculated, thinking that they might only have

<TEXT>
   The Upjohn Co. and a Tokyo-based
pharmaceutical company have announced a joint venture to bring
Japanese health products to the United States.
   Upjohn and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. will form a third
company, which will be named later. Chugai will own 55 percent and
Upjohn will own the rest. The new company will be based in the
United States, the companies said Friday.
   The agreement announced today calls for Chugai to license
products to the new company and for Upjohn to be the exclusive
distributor for seven years. Among the products heading for the
United States are erythropoietin, which stimulates production of
red blood cells, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, which
stimulates white blood cells.
   They can be used to treat anemia associated with kidney dialysis
and in transfusions and cancer chemotherapy.
   ``Upjohn and Chugai have had an excellent business relationship
since 1982,'' said Lawrence C. Hoff, Upjohn president and chief
operating officer.
   Kimio Uyeno, chairman of Chugai, said, ``We intend to establish
our capability to develop Chugai's new products and technologies
through the joint venture. ...
   ``With Upjohn's help, the corporation is expected to become a
fully integrated pharmaceutical company through gradual transitions
in the future,'' he said.
   Upjohn spokesman Robert D. LaRue said the location of the new
company's headquarters and its employment level haven't been
decided. He declined to speculate about the new company's sales
level.

<TEXT>
   A Michigan congressman is urging unionized
flight attendants at Northwest Airlines to strike the company,
saying a cooling off period has ended.
   Rep. William Ford, a Democrat from Taylor in suburban Detroit,
said Thursday the Teamsters union should strike the airline since
talks between the two sides have reached an impasse.
   ``The demands the company are making now would provoke a strike
in any factory in my district,'' said Ford, whose district includes
Detroit Metropolitan Airport, one of Northwest's three major hubs.
The others are in Minneapolis and Memphis, Tenn.
   Teamsters airline division leader William Genoese Sr. said he
met Thursday with Ford and Michigan Sen. Donald Riegle, also a
Democrat, and was pleased with their support for his union.
   A Teamsters strike deadline passed nearly a week ago as
negotiations between the Minnesotat-based company and the union
representing its 6,700 flight attendants continued. Since then,
talks have broken off and no new negotiations have been scheduled.
   The union has said there will be a strike, but has not said when
or to what extent.

   USAir officials have agreed to buy 50 Boeing
737 jetliners with options for 30 additional aircraft in a deal
worth $2.4 billion.
   Edwin Colodny, USAir chairman and president, said Thursday the
order ``is indicative of the health and vitality'' of the airline,
which is headquartered at Washington National Airport.
   The 50 aircraft on order will include some of the smaller series
500 models that will be introduced by Boeing in early 1989. The
Boeing 737s have a seating capacity ranging from 108 seats for the
series 500 model to 150 seats in the series 400 jet.
   Delivery of the new jets will begin in April 1989 and continue
through December 1991.
   The twin-engine, short-to-medium range aircraft is the most
popular jet ever sold by Seattle-based Boeing Co. The deal with
USAir brings to 2,001 Boeing 737s on order.
   USAir, which traditionally has concentrated its flights in the
Northeast, became the fifth largest airline company last year with
the acquisition of PSA and Piedmont. While the three airlines still
operate as separate carriers there are plans to merge them into a
single carrier in the future.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Open Higher; Other Grains Move Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures opened higher while other grains
and soybeans opened lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices advanced in reaction to the Agriculture
Department's announcement Thursday afternoon that it had sold just
1.4 million bushels of surplus wheat Wednesday in the second of
three auctions slated for this week, analysts said.
   The USDA had set a target of 10 million bushels for each of the
auctions, which are designed to meet increased demand by selling
government-owned stocks of the grain.
   The agency hit its target on Tuesday, but fell far short on
Wednesday, easing fears among traders that the increased
availability of wheat could depress cash prices. Another auction
was scheduled for this afternoon.
   The USDA also announced Thursday that American and Soviet
negotiators would meet next week to start work on a new, long-term
grain agreement. The announcement prompted further confidence in
the wheat market, said Richard Loewy, an analyst in New York for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He said prices for future delivery of soybeans fell on technical
factors while corn was nearly unchanged.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.06{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.00{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $1.86 a bushel; soybeans
were 2{ cents to 3{ cents lower with March at $6.19{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .18 cent higher with April at
70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .35 cent
higher with March at 79.25 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.50 cent higher with April at 42.70 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .75 cent to .88 cent higher with March at 53.05 cents
a pound.
   Cattle futures settled sharply lower on Thursday. Pork futures
finished slightly lower.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Way Down Because of Stronger Employment Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bonds prices tumbled in heavy trading and
interest rates jumped sharply this morning in reaction to the
government's surprisingly strong February employment report.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue fell more than 1{ points or $15
per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to
price and is a barometer of interest rate trends, surged to 8.44
percent from 8.31 percent late Thursday.
   ``The deterioration is quite obviously a response to the
employment situation,'' said William Sullivan, director of money
market research at the investment firm of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The Labor Department said the economy created half a million
jobs last month, dropping the civilian unemployment rate to 5.7
percent, its lowest since the summer of 1979. The January rate had
been 5.8 percent.
   Credit-market analysts said the job-creation figure was more
than twice the general estimate and suggested there would be
heightening demand for credit and rising inflation, which depresses
bond prices.
   Nevertheless, some saw elements of weakness in the Labor
Department report, particularly a slowdown in the creation of
manufacturing jobs, suggesting future inventory buildups and
production cutbacks.
   After a detailed analysis of the report filtered through the
bond market, prices were likely to stabilize or recover somewhat,
some analysts speculated.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell { point, intermediate maturities fell one point
and long-term issues fell more than 1{ points, the financial
information service Telerate Inc. reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Merrill Lynch Daily Treasury Index, which measures price
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a
year or longer, fell 0.76 to 113.25. The Shearson Lehman Daily
Treasury Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, dropped
8.05 to 1,184.34.
   Among corporate bonds, industrials and utilities fell between }
to 1 point in heavy trading.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, fell 1.07 to 285.09.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills jumped 13 basis points to
5.73 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Six-month bills rose 12 basis points to 5.98 percent and year bills
rose 13 basis points to 6.16 percent.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 6{ percent, up from 67-16 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Tektronix Inc. To Lay Off About 1,000 Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tektronix Inc. will lay off about 1,000
employees by May 28 to cut the growth of expenses, which has
outpaced sales growth, the electronics manufacturer announced.
   ``There's just no question that we must reverse that trend to
get Tek back on the track to growth and profitability,'' said David
P. Friedley, president and chief executive officer, on Friday.
   Tektronix employs about 16,900 workers, with about 11,000 in
Oregon and southwest Washington. Most of the layoffs will affect
managerial and professional workers in the Portland area, the
company said in a news release.
   The first phase of the layoffs will affect about 300 employees
in the company's information display group. They were notified of
the layoffs Friday. Employees in other divisions will be notified
of their job status in the next few weeks, the company said.
   The layoffs follow a recent companywide review by a new
management team.
   ``The reductions cause us to lose some very fine people,''
Friedley said. ``Their talents will be missed. But the fact is,
we've been operating at less-than-maximum efficiency and our
appetite for many projects and programs is greater than our
pocketbook can adequately fund.''
   Friedley was chosen to succeed Earl Wantland on Nov. 1.
Friedley's new management team was announced Jan. 12.
   ``We have a number of growing, profitable businesses which are
performing well, including portable oscilloscopes,
television-related units, and the graphics printer and terminal
division,'' Friedley said. ``We are also aggressively pursuing
other growth opportunities, such as telecommunications equipment,
workstations and measurement systems.''
   The company said it expects to record a loss for the third
quarter, which ends March 5. The layoffs will result in significant
expenses for severance pay and restructuring during the quarter.
   Employees will be offered one week's severance pay for each year
with the company, with a minimum of two weeks' pay.
   The company's sales in 1987 totaled $1.39 billion.

   Ten employees have purchased Standard
Chemical Manufacturing Co. of Omaha, a 102-year-old livestock feed
firm, from a group of New York and St. Louis investors.
   The price of the leveraged buyout was not disclosed.
   ``After 98 years of profitability, the company was unprofitable
the last couple of years,'' Executive Vice President Bill Dyer said.
   Dyer and Greg Kluck, who becomes the seventh president in
Standard Chemical's history, are the firm's majority owners.
   James M. Paxson will remain as chairman, Dyer said. Paxson
joined the company in 1953 as assistant to the president and became
president in 1961.
   In October 1983, Paxson, the majority stockholder in the
employee-owned company, sold to a buying group headed by Tom M.
Reese of St. Louis, who became president, and R.B. Halaby,
president of Ibec Agri-Finance Co. of New York, who became chairman
of the finance committee.
   Dyer said Standard Chemical, which sells its feed items via the
Standard Quality Feeds label, would remain intact.
   Standard Chemical, has plants in Malvern, Iowa, and Marshall,
Minn. It sells livestock feed in Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, South
Dakota, Minnesota and Montana.
   The company was founded in 1886 as the Standard Stock Food Co.
by F.E. Sanborn, a veterinarian. The company adopted its present
name in 1912.

   Treasury Secretary James Baker said today that
the new commission created to find solutions to the government's
huge budget deficits would be making a mistake if it became
embroiled in election-year politics.
   The National Economic Commission was holding its initial meeting
today behind closed doors with Baker scheduled to address the
group. Before entering the session, Baker told reporters he would
urge the commission to keep a low profile during the 1988
presidential campaign.
   ``We will simply be making a point that the commission will be
more effective if it is not politicized. To be effective it should
not be viewed as a political apparatus of the 1988 campaign,''
Baker said.
   The Treasury secretary's position has drawn criticism from one
member of the commission, House Budget Committee Chairman William
Gray III, who on Thursday charged that the White House was trying
to dictate how the commission would function before it had even had
its first organizational session.
   He claimed that the administration, in an effort to cover up its
biggest economic failure, was lobbying to keep the National
Economic commission under wraps until after the presidential
election.
   The blue ribbon panel, which includes Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee Iacocca and New York investment banker Felix Rohatyn as
members, was expected to select a chairman today.
   Sources close to the panel said Robert Strauss, a Washington
lawyer and former head of the Democratic National Committee, was a
likely pick to head the group.
   Gray, one of six Democrats on the panel, took issue Thursday
with remarks made by Baker, who had suggested that the commission
should hold its deliberations in secret and not release any reports
before the November presidential election.
   Baker had said earlier this week that the administration was
eager for the commission ``to go to work,'' but he also said that
the commission's findings would carry more weight if the panel did
not become embroiled in election-year politics.
   Baker said the best way to avoid this was to meet in secret and
not release any interim reports. The panel, which was created by
Congress, is scheduled to present its final recommendations by
March 1 of next year.
   ``I don't think this commission should start off being dictated
to by the White House,'' Gray told reporters. ``Someone is
suggesting that we meet in a cave and roll a stone over the
opening.''
   Supporters of the deficit commission hope that because of its
bipartisan nature it will be able to break the logjam which has
prevented the government from crafting solutions to the budget
deficit, which this year is expected to top $150 billion.
   Gray suggested that Baker and other Republicans were trying to
keep the commission under wraps so that it would not become a forum
for airing the administration's biggest economic failure, the
doubling of the national debt.
   ``I don't think it is appropriate for the White House to say
there should be nothing said or done until they get out of town,''
Gray said. ``That is like the guilty party saying don't hand down
sentence until we leave town.''
   The commission is considered by many to be the best hope the
next president will have to reach a quick consensus with Congress
on significant ways to reduce the budget deficit.

<HEAD>May Agrees With Campeau On Conditional Purchase Of Filene's,
Foley's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. today said May Department Stores
Co. has agreed to buy two divisions of Federated Department Stores
Inc. _ Filene's and Foley's _ if Campeau completes its hostile
takeover bid for Federated.
   Toronto-based Campeau said the agreement with May would make it
easier to obtain the financing for its bid for Cincinnati-based
Federated and reduce the amount of long-term debt that would be
needed after the acquisition.
   May said the purchase of Filene's and Foley's would strengthen
its business. Filene's is based in Boston and Foley's in Houston.
Campeau said they were worth about $1.5 billion together, but did
not say how much May had agreed to pay.
   On Thursday, Campeau threatened a court challenge to a merger
agreement between Federated and R.H. Macy & Co.
   Campeau, which had its rival buyout offer snubbed by Federated,
stated it intended to challenge provisions requiring Federated to
pay Macy fees of up to $45 million if their merger fell through
under certain conditions.
   Macy late Tuesday agreed to acquire Federated for cash and
securities in a deal valued by some analysts at a total of about
$6.1 billion.
   In accepting Macy's offer, Federated spurned Campeau's bid to
pay about $6.18 billion in cash for the retailing company.
   Under its current offer, Campeau would pay $75 per share in cash
for 80 percent of Federated's shares, and after a merger would pay
$44 per share for the remaining 20 percent. The company said the
offer _ revised from a previous $68 a share offer for all Federated
shares _ had a total value of about $68 a share on a fully diluted
basis.
   Campeau also has offered to raise its offer by 50 cents a share
if the breakup fee provision was withdrawn.
   The Macy-Federated merger will take six to 12 weeks to conclude,
when it will be submitted to Federated's shareholders for a vote.

   Uruguay is scheduled to sign a $1.8 billion

   The eight-member Bank Advisory Group for Uruguay said the pact

   Uruguay currently has around $4.6 billion in outstanding debt,
of which $2.2 billion is with commercial banks.
   The terms of the refinancing agreement include an interest-rate
margin of seven-eighths to 1 percent over the London Interbank

said.

   The independent Postal Rate Commission today recommended a
series of postage increases including boosting the price of a
first-class stamp from 22 cents to a quarter.
   A final decision on implementing the new rates is up to the
board of governors of the U.S. Postal Service, which requested the
increases 10 months ago, calling for a 25-cent stamp for first
class mail.
   The detailed and complex package of rate hikes recommended by
the rate commission included increases in most classes of mail. The
Postal Service had wanted increases averaging 16 percent.
   The new rate decision called for:
   _Raising the rate for post cards from 14 cents to 15 cents. The
Postal Service had requested a 16-cent rate.
   _Increasing the second-class rate for periodicals from 9.1 cents
to 9.8 cents per pound and the per-item rate from a range of 3.1 to
4.9 cents to a range of 4.9 to 5.9 cents.
   _For third-class advertising mail, the minimum bulk rate would
rise from 12.5 cents to 16.7 cents. The non-profit minimum would
rise from 8.5 cents to 9.0 cents.
   _The postal rate commission also recommended establishing a
special type of mail to give consumers a break in paying bills or
answering advertisements.
   The commission urged the Postal Service to come up with a
discount from regular first-class rates for such mail, but did not
propose a particular amount.
   The rate decision did, however, suggest giving businesses a
two-cent cut from the present seven-cent minimum in their cost for
business-reply envelopes. That, the agency said, would encourage
the use of such envelopes.
   The last increase in postage rates was Feb. 17, 1985, when
first-class stamps climbed to 22 cents.
   The planned higher rates are not related to recent cutbacks in
postal hours and collections, which resulted from budget cuts
mandated by Congress in December.
   The commission ruling will go to the Postal Service board of
governors, probably early next week. It can put the new rate into
effect within a few weeks, institute the rates under protest or ask
the rate commission for reconsideration, depending on its opinion
of the recommendation.
   Because it had no way of knowing what new rates the commission
would settle on, the Postal Service has printed non-denominated
stamps to cover eny eventuality.
   When the new rates take effect, the first class stamp will carry
the letter ``E.'' The stamp carries a colorful space-based image of
the Earth and the word ``Domestic,'' to indicate that it can be
used only within the United States, not for mail going to other
countries.
   The same procedure was used the last four times rates were
raised, with those undenominated stamps all carrying images of
Eagles and the letters ``A'' through ``D.''
   In seeking the rate hike, postal officials noted that the agency
is required to break even. It lost more than $220 million last year.
   After the Postal Service was made an independent agency in the
early 1970s, its taxpayer subsidy was eliminated.
   John N. Griesemer, chairman of the postal service's board of
governors, said the proposed increase should cost the average
individual less than $10 per year.
   In addition to raising the price of a first-class stamp from 22
cents to 25 cents, the Postal Service proposed a multitude of
changes in its complex structure of rates for the various types of
mail.
   Prices for the expensive but highly competitive overnight mail
would drop somewhat, for example, while rates for advertising bulk
mail would rise.
   The Postal Service has been in the black five of the last 10
years. It finished 1986 with a $305 million surplus after an
intensive campaign to cut costs, but had losses of $200 million or
more in both 1985 and 1987.
   In addition to increasing the first-class base rate to 25 cents,
the Postal Service called for an increase in the charge for each
additional ounce of weight for first class mail from 17 cents to 20
cents. Post cards would increase from 14 cents to 16 cents.

<HEAD>Report Says Reagan Underestimates Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Leads with 6 new grafs of testimony; picks up 4th graf pvs,
The congressional.</NOTE>

   President Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget would
leave a federal deficit of $165 billion, $35 billion higher than
the White House says, the Congressional Budget Office reported
today.
   Most of the difference results from the administration's more
optimistic view of the economy, said James Blum, acting director of
the non-partisan agency, in testimony to the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
   ``CBO foresees less rapid real growth, higher inflation and
higher interest rates,'' said Blum, who defended his agency's
prognosis as in line with private forecasts.
   The projection provoked Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, to express
frustration over the differences between the CBO and administration
forecasts.
   ``Why haven't you gotten together with OMB (the Office of
Management and Budget)?,'' he asked.
   Blum noted that over the years, White House economic forecasts
have been more optimistic than those coming from CBO, and said
choosing between them is ``a political judgment call'' Congress
must make.
   The congressional agency also sees federal programs, including
entitlement programs, as costing more than the administration
predicts in its $1.1 trillion plan, he said.
   ``The administration's budget would cut the projected deficits
only modestly,'' said Blum. Fiscal 1989 red ink would be $12
billion higher, or $177 billion, if the president's proposals or
other deficit reduction were not enacted, he said.
   The House and Senate budget committees will soon begin drafting
their versions of the government's spending program. However, they
are not expected to do more deficit cutting this year than the
president proposed, since his plan was crafted under the guidelines
of a budget agreement he reached last fall with congressional
leaders.
   The CBO estimates that the economy will grow 1.8 percent in
calendar 1988 and 2.6 percent in 1989, compared with White House
growth predictions of 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent. The CBO also
sees consumer prices rising more quickly, with higher interest
rates and higher unemployment.
   Lower growth cuts into tax revenue projections, while higher
interest rates force the government to pay more to finance its
programs.
   The Gramm-Rudman law calls for slashing the deficit to $136
billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 as an interim step
toward a balanced budget by fiscal 1993. It also mandates
automatic, broad-based spending cuts if Congress and the president
don't approve legislation to come within $10 billion of the target.
   The CBO's projections show those targets being missed by a large
margin. But the congressional agency's figures carry little legal
weight, since official Gramm-Rudman estimates are done by the White
House alone. A revised version of Gramm-Rudman approved last year
left the CBO in only an advisory capacity.
   The CBO's latest revised projections show deficits higher than
the administration estimates from this year straight through fiscal
1993. The White House predicts only $23 billion in red ink
remaining by then, while CBO estimates an annual deficit still in
excess of $100 billion.
   Long-range economic estimates can vary widely. But the CBO and
the White House deficit estimates also show a wide gap in the
current fiscal year, which is nearly half over.
   The White House predicts $147 billion in red ink for fiscal
1988, which ends Sept. 30, while CBO figures $161 billion will be
added to the national debt.

<HEAD>Former Bank Chairman, Stockbroker Charged In Insider Trading Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of a Connecticut bank and a
stockbroker were charged today in connection with a two-year
federal investigation into insider trading that allegedly preceded
the bank's 1986 merger with a Maine bank, authorities said.
   Robert DiGennaro, 40, who resigned as chairman of the Suffield
Savings Bank last July, faces one count of obstruction of justice,
two counts of perjury and one count of encouraging perjury, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary C. Crossen.
   He also was charged with one count each of insider trading, wire
fraud and mail fraud in a federal indictment today in New Haven,
Conn.
   Arthur Silverman, 62, a West Hartford, Conn., stockbroker, was
charged with one count of perjury in the Boston indictment and the
same three counts as DiGennaro today in New Haven. Silverman was
not in court in Boston to enter a plea.
   DiGennaro, who was arraigned in Boston before U.S. Magistrate
Joyce London Alexander, pleaded innocent on all four charges and
was released on his own recognizance. His travel was restricted to
within New England and he was ordered not to try to obtain a
passport, Crossen said.
   It was not immediately clear if Silverman and DiGennaro had
entered pleas to the charges in New Haven.
   The charges are came out of a federal Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation into the merger between Suffield Savings
and Coastal Bank of Portland, Maine.
   The Boston charges were based on allegedly perjured testimony by
the two men before SEC officials in Boston in 1987.
   U.S. Attorney Frank McNamara said his office is conducting a
comprehensive investigation into insider trading across New England.
   McNamara said no one involved in the case made more than $50,000
and that the total amount of profit was in the ``mid-six figures.''
   ``You don't have to be an Ivan Boesky to be concerned about the
problem of insider trading,'' McNamara said. ``Insider trading and
perjury in the white-collar world of the kind we deal with is a
problem federal authorities in New England are going to ferret
out.''
   Crossen said a federal investigation of DiGennaro on insider
trading charges is pending in the U.S. attorney's New Haven, Conn.,
office.
   According to the indictments, DiGennaro was not personally
involved in insider trading but did profit from the alleged deals.
It said Silverman purchased more than 2,000 shares of Coastal stock
for clients and family members in the days leading up to the merger.
   The indictments charge DiGennaro with providing a number of
people with secret information about the merger while he was
discussing the possibility of a merger with Coastal between
February 1986 and July 1986, when the sale became public.
   Based on information they got from DiGennaro, a number of people
purchased stock in Coastal before the announcement of the merger,
the indictments say. The indictments said Silverman learned about
the secret merger discussions from a man who said he got his
information from DiGennaro.
   Each count carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   Suffield Savings was purchased by Coastal on July 9, 1986, for
$5.2 million, or $40 a share. Authorities began investigating the
case because the day before the merger, Coastal stock rose $2 a
share on heavy trading to close at $31.25. The stock rose another
$3 a share the day the merger was announced.

   Japan's Toshiba Corp. sold machines for making
computer parts to Czechoslovakia and East Germany but broke off a
third deal last summer after it was discovered by U.S. officials,
according to congressional sources.
   A Pentagon spokesman denied that the deals had occurred, but
several members of Congress said intelligence analysts have
prepared reports that the illegal technology transfers did take
place.
   ``Toshiba has been involved over the last seven years in
enhancing the microchip capability of the Warsaw pact nations,''
said an aide to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.
   The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had no
direct knowledge of classified reports from the Central
Intelligence Agency and the military Defense Intelligence Agency.
   Those reports were described in today's editions of The
Washington Times. Another congressional source, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed those allegations, which come six
months after Toshiba admitted that a subsidiary had sold the Soviet
Union machine tools for making quiet submarine propellers, thereby
neutralizing a portion of U.S. anti-submarine defenses.
   According to congressional sources, Toshiba sold Czechoslovakia
a complete factory in 1979 to make computer chips, sold East
Germany a similar but more advanced computer-chip assembly line in
1986, and negotiated a deal for a second assembly line in East
Germany in 1987.
   The deals have become known as Toshiba 2, Toshiba 3 and Toshiba
4. Toshiba 1 is the submarine case.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Col, Arnold Williams, said that ``the
information that we have is that we feel these actions, Toshiba 2,
3 and 4, have not occurred.''
   Williams said he was unable to discuss the CIA and DIA reports.
   Officials in the office of Stephen Bryen, the deputy
undersecretary of defense for trade security, also declined to
discuss the allegations.
   According to congressional sources, the Czechoslovak deal was of
questionable legality, and the 1986 East Germany deal was illegal
under Western export laws.
   Defenders say the first deal was legal, the second never
happened and in the third instance, Toshiba voluntarily acted out
of public-relations concerns to halt what would have been a legal
sale.
   Toshiba attorney David Houlihan called the allegations the
result of a ''vendetta'' by a group of CIA analysts against Toshiba
and Japan, according to the published report.
   As a result of the sale to the Soviet bloc, House and Senate
conferees are working on a bill that could ban Toshiba sales in the
United States for two to five years, said Duncan's aide.
   The congressman has organized classified briefings for about 30
lawmakers by CIA and DIA analysts who are convinced that the
transactions did occur, said the aide.
   ``Intelligence officials have confirmed them to our
satisfaction,'' said the aide.
   ``There has been a lot of pressure from the administration'' not
to damage trade relations with Japan, said the aide. ``The strength
of the conflict between the Congress and the administration is
intense.''

<HEAD>Takeover Target Sweetens Recap Plan to Thwart Black & Decker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. today intensified a
struggle to escape a hostile $2.1 billion takeover from Black &
Decker Corp. by sweetening a rival recapitalization plan that
analysts valued at about $2.3 billion.
   The move disclosed by the New York-based plumbing and air
conditioning giant would add $5 cash to the payment of cash and
securities that American Standard has offered shareholders to woo
them away from the $68-a-share cash payment Black & Decker has
offered for each of the target's 31 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts figured the sweetened American Standard
offer of $64 in cash, $5 in debt securities and one share of stock
in the recapitalized company was worth about $74 a share. The
company's stock surged $1.50 a share to $70.12{ on the New York
Stock Exchange by early afternoon.
   Black & Decker, a tool and appliance maker based in Towson, Md.,
said it was studying the sweetened American Standard offer but had
no other comment.
   American Standard's move came a few days after it disclosed
discussions with unidentified parties regarding the possible sale
of debt securities to sweeten the cash portion of its
recapitalization.
   Under the revised proposal, American Standard will sell $160
million worth of debt securities to Emerson Electric Co. As part of
the transaction, American Standard also will purchase some
unidentified products from Emerson, a St. Louis-based maker of
electronics, tools and cooling and heating systems.
   A recapitalization, in which a company restructures its amount
of debt and equity, is used often to thwart unwelcome takeovers.
The strategy usually plunges a company into debt, making it less
attractive as an acquisition.
   American Standard's revised plan, which would raise the
company's long-term debt from $412 million to about $2.46 billion,
would pay shareholders about $2.06 billion plus give them a stake
in the recapitalized company.
   Black & Decker has been attempting since late January to acquire
American Standard.

   The nation's economy created half a million
jobs last month, dropping the civilian unemployment rate to 5.7
percent, its lowest since the summer of 1979, the government said
today.
   Total employment grew by 280,000, the Labor Department's monthly
household survey said, with the number of jobless Americans falling
by 108,000 to 6.9 million.
   January's civilian jobless rate had been 5.8 percent.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater applauded the news,
saying that ``these strong employment gains confirm that the
longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history continued into its 63rd
month. Jobs are the best indicator of a sound economy.''
   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a net increase of
531,000 jobs in February, 40 percent of which were in service
industries. Health services added 60,000 workers while business
services added 55,000.
   Retail trade employment, adjusted for seasonal variations,
climbed by 110,000 despite evidence of declines in consumer
spending.
   The commissioner of labor statistics, Janet L. Norwood, said the
gains in retail-trade employment reflect ``post-Christmas cutbacks
this year that have been much smaller than usual.''
   The only service industries that did not show job gains were
finance, insurance and real estate. In fiance, which includes
banks; savings and loans, and investment houses, employment
actually fell by 10,000 after several months of minimal increases.
   ``This probably resulted from the employment retrenchment
following last October's financial market upheavels,'' Ms. Norwood
told the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   Meanwhile, factory job growth, which had been averaging 50,000
jobs a month, moderated in February, with a gain of just 20,000.
Employment in the furniture and electronic equipment industries
fell by 3,000 while automobile industry employment held steady at
822,000.
   Construction jobs jumped by 105,000 after a drop of 60,000 in
the preceding month.
   The percentage of the nation's adult population with jobs rose
to a record 62.2 percent in February. The Labor Department said
recent job growth has been particularly strong in the
administrative and management areas, accounting for more than
one-third of the growth of 3 million jobs in total civilian
employment over the last year.
   The biggest beneficiary of that trend and the recent rebound in
manufacturing and construction has been adult men, whose jobless
rate has dropped from 5.8 percent in February 1987 to 4.9 percent
last month.
   The jobless rate for women, also at 5.8 percent a year ago, was
5.2 percent in February.
   Jobless rates for minority groups remained high despite the fact
that blacks and Hispanics have obtained one of every three new jobs
over the last year.
   Black unemployment, at 12.6 percent last month, was more than
double the 4.8 percent for whites. Hispanic unemployment, after
declining to 7.2 percent in January, bounced back to 8.3 percent
last month to return to the level that generally prevailed through
most of the last half of 1987.
   Teenage unemployment fell from 16.0 percent to 15.4 percent last
month. Among white teenagers, the rate fell from 14.0 percent to
12.4 percent; among black teens, the rate rose from 35.0 percent to
38.3 percent.
   An alternate jobless rate, including the 1.7 million members of
the uniformed armed services stationed in the United States, also
dropped 0.1 percentage point last month, to 5.6 percent.
   All the calculations are adjusted to discount for predictable,
periodic influences.

   With more than a half-million new jobs last
month, the nation's civilian unemployment rate dropped to 5.7
percent, the government said Friday, indicating a much stronger
U.S. economy than most analysts had thought.
   Only once since 1974 _ in May 1979 when the rate was 5.6 percent
_ has the percentage of jobless Americans been lower. With a
one-tenth percentage point drop from December's and January's
jobless rates of 5.8 percent, the rolls of the unemployed declined
by 108,000 in February to just over 6.9 million, the lowest jobless
number since early 1980.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics said its survey of households
showed 280,000 more Americans going to work last month, with an
all-time record 62.2 percent of the nation's working-age population
_ age 16 and over _ now holding jobs.
   Business and other employers reported in a separate survey
increasing their payrolls by a net 531,000 new jobs _ 115,000 of
them in business and health services, 110,000 in retail trade,
105,000 in construction, 68,000 in government and 20,000 in
manufacturing.
   ``These numbers have killed all discussion about no growth this
quarter,'' said James Cochran, chief economist for Texas Bancshares
in Houston.
   ``The economy is doing pretty well,'' Cochran said. ``And to
everyone's surprise, the strength is coming from basic domestic
activity rather than companies hiring people to produce things to
sell overseas.''
   Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch, said the
February job numbers were the most surprising economic statistics
he has ever seen.
   ``There's 400,000 more people working now than we had thought,''
he said. ``The housing market is weak, construction is weak and,
except for automobiles, consumers don't seem to be buying anything.
Some of it just doesn't make any sense.''
   Nonetheless, Straszheim joined a chorus of other economists in
saying that the unemployment report effectively negates their
earlier predictions of little or no economic growth this year.
   ``This report makes it clear there is no recession in the
cards,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., a
New York-based financial consultant. ``The real question is how
much steam the economy will gather. As incomes start flowing from
this surge in jobs, the future looks pretty bright.''
   The jobless report shines brightest on Republican presidential
candidates seeking to retain GOP control of the White House, the
economic gurus agreed.
   ``The economic statistic that has more political import than any
other is unemployment,'' said Straszheim, ``and this is a very
strong report.''
   ``George Bush ought to be running over to kiss the people at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics,'' said David Wyss, chief financial
economist of Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ``People vote
their pocketbooks, and right now their pocketbooks look pretty
full.''
   At the White House, Reagan administration officials also basked
in the numbers.
   ``Both the February increase in employment and the decline in
unemployment exceeded the expectations of private forecasters,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``Jobs are the best
indicator of a sound economy.''
   Sinai said the unemployment rate, down from a full percentage
point from 12 months ago, can only be a ``big plus for
Republicans.''
   ``It certainly doesn't argue that we need protectionism to help
our job market,'' said Wyss, referring to Rep. Richard Gephardt's
campaign theme for winning the Democratic presidential nomination.
   Democrats, however, could utilize some of the figures in the
report. Despite inflation running at an annual rate of 4.2 percent
so far this year, average wages dropped by 2 cents last month to
$9.12 an hour, the BLS said.
   ``That's both bad and good news,'' Straszheim said. ``If you're
working, it means your wages aren't keeping you up. But if you're
fearful about inflation, don't be.''
   The figures also indicate that 199,000 of the 280,000 increase
in the number of Americans holding jobs were people working
part-time only because they could not find full-time employment.
   However, the Labor Department said recent employment growth has
been strongest in high-wage administrative and management
occupations, accounting for more than one-third of the 3 million
new jobs in the past year.
   The biggest beneficiaries of that trend and the recent rebound
in manufacturing and construction employment have been adult men,
whose jobless rate has dropped from 5.8 percent in February 1987 to
4.9 percent last month.
   The jobless rate for women, also at 5.8 percent a year ago, was
5.2 percent in February.
   Jobless rates for minority groups remained high despite the fact
that blacks and Hispanics have obtained one of every three new jobs
over the last year, the government said.
   Black unemployment, at 12.6 percent last month, was more than
double the 4.8 percent for whites. Hispanic unemployment, after
declining to 7.2 percent in January, rose to 8.3 percent last month.
   An alternate jobless rate, including the 1.7 million members of
the uniformed armed services stationed in the United States, also
dropped 0.1 percentage point last month, to 5.6 percent.

<HEAD>Officials Express Regret Over Rejection Of Japan-U.S. Construction
Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Government and construction industry officials
Friday expressed regret over a U.S. refusal to award a contract to
a joint venture between Japanese and American construction firms
for a subway extension project in the United States.
   ``It is indeed regrettable that a concerned Japanese firm was
excluded'' from an American public works project at a time when
Japanese and U.S. officials in Washington are discussing opening
some of Japan's large-scale construction projects to U.S. firms,
said Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi in a nationally televised
news conference.
   The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Thursday
rejected a bid from Kajima Corp., a major Japanese contractor,
together with Peter Kiewit and Sons Corp. of the United States, to
construct a 1,200-meter subway tunnel and station in Washington
D.C., officials said.
   According to the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), it was the
first time a Japanese construction firm involved in bidding for an
American public works project was rejected since the U.S. Congress
last year passed legislation calling for reciprocity in awarding
such contracts.
   Local reports said the bid by the two companies totaled 6.3
billion yen, or $48.8 million, the lowest offer among an
unspecified number of international bidders.
   Hajime Sako, chairman of the Japan Federation of Construction
Contractors Inc., said in a statement that ``...the fact that the
Japanese firm's tender was actually canceled is extremely
regrettable.''
   Sako, also chairman of Taisei Corp., a major Japanese
construction firm, said the local construction industry ``strongly
hopes the latest U.S. measure will be retracted as soon as
possible, and that such a measure, which will adversely affect
friendly Japan-U.S. relations, will not be taken again.''
   Kishio Nagayama, president of Kajima Engineering and
Construction Inc., a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary based in Los
Angeles, California, that handled the latest bidding, also
expressed regret over the decision.
   In a statement issued by the company's head office in Tokyo,
Nagayama said his company will decide how to respond by consulting
with its U.S. partner.
   Japanese and U.S. officials resumed working-level talks in
Washington Thursday to discuss access to Japan's large-scale
construction projects. Both sides failed to reach agreement in a
previous meeting held in Tokyo last month.
   Access to the Japanese construction market has been a major
trade issue in recent years between the two countries. To date,
U.S. firms have had access to only two semi-public projects in
Japan _ the Tokyo Bay bridge and the multi-billion dollar Kansai
International airport project.
   Japanese firms won about $2.3 billion worth of contracts in the
United States in 1986, while U.S. companies did about $500 million
dollars worth of business in Japan, according to construction
officials.

   The stock market declined broadly today as
interest rates jumped following a stronger-than-expected report on
employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 6 points
in early trading, was down 17.90 at 2,045.59 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 495 up, 943 down and
466 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate dropped a tenth of a percentage point
last month to an 8{-year low of 5.7 percent.
   Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 531,000, considerably
more than most advance estimates on Wall Street.
   The news was seen as an emphatic signal that the economy remains
strong several months after the stock market crash last October.
But it was not well received in the credit markets, where traders
interpreted is as a likely portent of upward pressure on interest
rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell more than $15 for each
$1,000 in face value, raising their yields to the 8.4-8.5 percent
range.
   Among actively traded blue-chip industrials, American Telephone

<HEAD>Wente Wines Completes Order For Japan's Bullet Train</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACK SCHREIBMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The century-old Wente Bros. winery has
completed its first shipment of wine for Japan's Bullet Train, the
winery reported on Friday.
   The delivery to Japan Railways marks the first order of American
wine by the Toyota Motor Co., according to Debra Sanchez,
spokeswoman for Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A.
   ``It's just the beginning,'' she said. ``The Japanese are
falling in love with California wines.''
   The first order was for 29,000 mini-bottles of chablis, blanc de
blancs, and white zinfandel, chosen after exhaustive taste tests of
the Livermore winery's 14 wines, said Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.
Vice President Robert Best.
   ``Exporting California wines to Japan is another example of
Toyota's commitment to increase Japanese purchases of U.S.
products,'' said Best.
   ``I'm excited, not only for Wente Brothers but the entire
California wine industry,'' said Wente spokeswoman Carolyn Wente.
Her ancestor, Carl Wente, acquired his first vineyards in Livermore
in 1883, growing sauvignon blanc and semillon grapes. Wente whites
have been sold in the United States for 100 years.
   The wines for Japan were chosen for their expected popularity on
the trains. The choices virtually parallel American popular tastes.
The blanc de blancs is a light, sweet blend that includes chenin
blanc. Chablis is regarded around the world as the typical dry
white table wine.
   Wente has been exporting small amounts of wine to Japan for 20
years but thwarted by extremely high tariffs that found a bottle of
wine that sold for $4 in Califoria selling for $18-20 in Japan. The
taxes were lowered a couple of years ago, and the retail price in
Japan is now reported to be about double the California price.
   The United States today already is the second largest exporter
of wine to Japan, behind France, with Germany in third.
   Best said Toyota acted in this instance as a broker ordering the
wine, exporting it and selling it to the railway in Japan.
   The 6.3-ounce bottles will be sold on the 120 mph trains that
travel from Tokyo. The wines will go for about $2.50 each, he said.
   Toyota established a U.S. exports office in 1985 to search out
American products appropriate for the Japanese market and to reduce
the U.S. deficit in the balance of payments, Best said. Wente is
the first U.S. wine taken on by Toyota, he said.
   ``There has been a doubling in Japanese consumption of wine over
the last several years, and wine sales have grown over 400 percent
in the last five years,'' said Best.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in European trading Friday. Gold prices rose nearly $10 an ounce in
London and $3 in Zurich.
   Merrill Lynch metals specialist Ted Arnold said gold bullion
climbed to $437.50 bid per troy ounce because of a short-covering
rally and a dip in monthly U.S. unemployment figures. Gold closed
at 427.80 an ounce late Thursday.
   He said the figures, which showed that the February rate fell to
5.7 percent from 5.8 percent in January, rekindled fears of
inflation.
   In Zurich, gold rose less sharply, to $432 bid an ounce, from
$429 dollars, on short-covering prompted by gains in silver and
platinum, dealers said.
   In a short sale, traders sell borrowed gold in expectation of
``covering'' those sales by replacing the gold with new lots bought
at cheaper prices.
   Foreign exchange dealers said U.S. unemployment figures briefly
pushed up the U.S. currency but the improvement in the rate was not
enough to have a lasting effect on the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar inched lower to a closing 129.22 Japanese
yen from 129.30 yen. In London, it fell further to 128.95 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
were: 1.6940 West German marks, down from 1.6955; 1.4030 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4035; 5.7300 French francs, down from 5.7355;
1.9010 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9025; 1,248.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,249.25, and 1.2547 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2535
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7740 from $1.7680 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.67 to a closing bid of
$431.27.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.41 a troy
ounce, up from $6.22 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Kodak Note Sale Sets Record; Investors Snap It Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest investment-grade corporate bond
issue ever sold in the United States _ $1.1 billion in 10-year
notes _ went off with picture-perfect ease this past week.
   And experts say they weren't surprised since the seller was
Eastman Kodak Co., which priced the issue generously to compensate
for a recent drop in its credit rating.
   ``A lot of people love to own the name ...,'' explained Anthony
Naylor, a senior vice president in fixed-income securities for
Rodman & Renshaw Inc. ``But they've always had to pay through the
nose before.''
   The record issue _ undertaken partly to help finance Kodak's
recent $5.1 billion acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc. _ was priced
at par to yield 9.125 percent, a percentage point more than
comparable Treasury securities.
   The 10-year notes are noncallable for seven years and rated A-2
by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp.
   Both Wall Street rating services lowered Kodak's senior debt
rating in response to the Sterling deal and legal problems with
Polaroid Corp. over an instant photography patent.
   But analysts say that probably added to the allure of the $1.1
billion issue because the lower the rating a company receives, the
higher the interest it must pay to compensate for the increased
credit risk.
   ``It was very generously priced,'' said Naylor of the notes,
noting that previous issues by the blue-chip company have had a
much narrower yield spread.
   For instance, Kodak's $300 million in four-year notes issued in
October yielded 60 basis points above Treasury securities with
similar maturities, and $125 million in five-year notes from last
spring had only a 25-basis point spread, he said. A basis point is
one-hundredth of a percentage point.
   Naylor said the fact that the issue was so large also
contributed to its success since ``everyone can get in and play,
giving it plenty of liquidity,'' or the ability to sell at any time
without depressing the market price.
   Kodak also came out ahead by the fact that the bonds were sold
at par, or the full face amount. In less successful deals, bonds
are sold at a discount to increase their attractiveness.
   The Rochester, N.Y., company originally had planned to sell only
$750 million in 10-year notes, but increased the size by $350
million because of the strong demand by domestic institutions,
explained Richard W. Swift, a principal at Morgan Stanley & Co.,
underwriters of the issue.
   ``I think it was one of the hottest deals I ever experienced,''
he said, adding that one institution snapped up $75 million of the
notes. ``There's magic to the Kodak name.''
   Some analysts said the popularity of the issue could be read as
a vote of confidence in Kodak's management and its ability to
digest the Sterling deal, which had been criticized as overly
ambitious by some who follow the company.
   Before this past week's issue, the single largest issue by a
U.S. corporation with investment-grade ratings came from Occidental
Petroleum Corp., which sold $1 billion of debentures in March 1986,
Swift said. About two years earlier, Chevron Corp. sold $1 billion
in three-year notes, he said.
   Kodak filed a shelf registration Dec. 30 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for $1.5 billion worth of bonds. The company
has $400 million left from that registration.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When new postage rates go into effect,
Americans will be using special ``E'' stamps on an interim basis to
mail first-class letters.
   The stamps were printed with the letter E on them, instead of
the amount of postage, because the new first-class rate was not
known.
   The Postal Rate Commission on Friday suggested postage rate
increases that included a 25-cent first-class stamp, but those
recommendations still must be accepted by the Postal Service board
of governors. The new rates could go into effect in 10 days to two
weeks after a decision is made, perhaps as early as next week.
   A similar procedure has been used four times in the past,
although the basic design of the undenominated stamp has changed.
   The A, B, C and D stamps all showed the head of an eagle, each
in a different color.
   The E stamp carries a multicolored, space-based image of the
plant with the word Earth printed beneath.
   The stamp also carries the notation ``Domestic'' since it can be
used only for mail within the country. Mail traveling to other
nations requires stamps that show their demoninations.

<HEAD>IBM In Talks With Siemens On Its New PC Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. confirmed
Friday it has discussed a deal involving its new personal computer
line with Siemens AG of West Germany, but said the executive who
made the talks public ``feels his comment on Siemens was premature
and inappropriate.''
   IBM's unusual statement was in reaction to an article Friday in
the Wall Street Journal that quoted William C. Lowe, the vice
president in charge of personal computers, on IBM's plans for its
Personal System-2 line.
   Siemens executives ``were very disturbed by what appeared in the
Journal,'' but the statement Friday will probably help matters,
said Martin Weitzner, a spokesman for Siemens' U.S. operations.
   According to the Journal, Lowe said that if a pact was reached,
Siemens would either license or buy from IBM the crucial parts of
IBM's PS-2 line and incorporate them into its own computers. Lowe
said it was even possible that some companies might buy PS-2
computers whole and sell them under their own labels.
   The Journal said IBM was in similar talks with Ing. C. Olivetti
& Co. of Italy, but IBM said that Lowe had only mentioned Olivetti
as an example of a company that could be considered.
   Such deals would be a major departure for IBM, which
traditionally keeps a tight grip on its own technology. But they
might benefit the company by helping establish the Personal
System-2 as an industry standard.

<HEAD>Irving Plans to Request Court Review of Fed Takeover Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp., the target of a hostile $1.08
billion takeover bid, said Friday it plans to appeal the Federal
Reserve Board's recent decision to allow a proposed merger with
Bank of New York Co.
   Irving filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of the Columbia earlier this week, saying it would ask
the court to reviw the central bank's decision, Irving spokesman
Don Phelps said.
   He said Irving also asked the Fed to delay the effect of its
ruling until the appeals court can review it.
   Irving has rejected takeover efforts by Bank of New York, which
has offered $60 a share in cash and securities for Irving's 18.1
million common shares.
   The takeover fight, launched last fall, has attracted attention
because hostile acquisitions are unusual in banking. Some analysts
speculate that if it succeeds, it may encourage other unsolicited
takeovers in the banking industry.
   The Fed and the New York State Banking Board concluded last
month that a merger of the two New York banks wouldn't hurt
competition in the nation's biggest financial center.
   The central bank said federal law ``does not draw any
distinction between acquisitions that are agreed to between the
parties and those where, as here, there is no agreement.''
   A merger would create the nation's 12th largest banking company
with assets of nearly $12 billion.

<HEAD>FAA Hits Northwest Airlines With Safety Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES PLAINES, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines flew two
``unairworthy'' jetliners, improperly delayed aircraft repairs and
broke other safety rules, the Federal Aviation Administration said
Friday.
   The FAA made disclosures with the release of 110-page report
detailing a month-long investigation of the airline's operations.
The report drew no overall conclusion and an FAA spokesman at its
suburban Chicago office said the Minneapolis-based carrier had a
``very good safety record.''
   However, the FAA report said the airline also failed to ensure
pilots flew no longer than allowed and did not keep proper records
of repairs, classifying some major repairs as minor.
   Northwest acknowledged in a statement that the FAA inspection
identified ``139 findings or areas of concern,'' some of which
could result in ``enforcement actions.''
   ``Of course, any finding is of concern to us and, as a result,
we have told the FAA we will respond completely to each and every
one of the findings on March 25,'' said Benjamin G. Griggs Jr.,
Northwest's executive vice president of operations.
   At least two Northwest Airlines jetliners, both DC-10s, flew
several flights between Jan. 1 and Feb. 11 ``in an unairworthy
condition,'' the report said.
   One of the jets flew while missing ``a small inspection cover''
on top of an engine pylon, the report said. A second jet flew
several trips even though the crew ``failed to neutralize or
identify the exact cause of'' a problem with a gauge monitoring the
speed of an engine turbine.
   ``This is not something that would make an airplane fall out of
the sky,'' said FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein.
   FAA authorities studied Northwest's operations from Jan. 20 to
Feb. 19 as part of an industry-wide program of conducting in-depth
inspections of all major airlines, Edelstein said.
   Edelstein said the FAA would make no decision on whether to fine
Northwest until the airline had a chance to respond and the
inspection report had been reviewed several times by agency
officials.
   A similar inspection at Eastern Airlines two years ago led to
fines totaling $9.5 million for hundreds of violations, mostly
involving maintenance discrepancies. Pan Am World Airways was fined
$1.95 million in 1986.
   Despite the safety violations identified at Northwest, Edelstein
said: ``The airline has a very good safety record. They fully
complied with the safety inspection.''
   Northwest said ``the findings of the final inspection are likely
to change'' after it responds to the FAA report, which the agency
said was still being checked for accuracy.
   ``A number of items already have been resolved,'' Griggs said.
``In our view, some of the findings are subject to interpretation,
and we will address these with our FAA inspectors.''
   The FAA inspectors found that Northwest ``does not have a system
to monitor flight and duty time for management pilots to ensure
compliance with flight time limitations.''
   In another violation, the FAA found that the pilot in command of
Northwest Flight 49 on Feb. 10 ``smoked a cigarette while the no
smoking light was on.''
   The inspection also found evidence of deferred maintenance. The
report said, for example, that a Boeing 757 was operated from Nov.
1 through Jan. 7 while having problems with its auxiliary power
unit. Repairs on the unit were deferred 13 times before the
equipment was replaced, the report said.
   The report found that Northwest flight dispatchers were burdened
with an ``excessive workload'' and contended the airline ``does not
provide enough qualified dispatchers at each dispatch center to
ensure proper operational control of each flight.''
   Edelstein and Northwest noted that the airline had conducted a
five-month internal audit before the FAA inspection began.
   The report said Northwest's own audit ``could serve as an
industry model'' and enabled the FAA ``to conduct a much more
thorough and comprehensive inspection than would otherwise have
been possible.''
   Northwest, which calls itself the nation's fifth largest
carrier, serves 135 cities in 21 countries in Asia, Europe and
North America. The company acquired Republic Airlines in 1986 and
has a fleet of 313 aircraft.

   Here are some of the findings released
Friday by the Federal Aviation Administration from its report on
the results of a monthlong inspection of Minneapolis-based
Northwest Airlines.
   In the area of operations, the inspectors found that:
   _``Northwest Airlines Inc. does not provide enough qualified
dispatchers at each dispatch center to ensure proper operational
control of each flight. Anonymous letters, phone calls and flight
crew complaints that dispatcher workloads were excessive and that
the monitoring of flight progress was untimely were substantiated
by observations of FAA inspectors at both the Tokyo and Minneapolis
dispatch centers.''
   _In several instances, Northwest pilots flew more than 30 hours
during a six-day period. FAA regulations prohibit pilots from
flying more than 30 hours in a seven-day period.
   _``On seven flights, the weight and balance information and
flight release data did not accurately reflect the total number of
infants@crew members@passengers.''
   _``The First Officer on Northwest Airlines Flight 455 (on)
2@12@88 did not have in his personal possession an appropriate
current medical certificate nor a current pilot certificate.''
   _Northwest ``has no provisions in their flight training program
to check an (individual pilot's) proficiency in hand-flying a
non-precision approach.''
   In the area of ``airworthiness,'' the inspectors found that:
   _On Jan. 14, a Northwest DC-10 pilot ``indicated a small
inspection cover on top of No. 3 engine pylon was missing.'' The
jetliner ``flew in an unairworthy condition from 1@14@88 until
2@3@88 when the inspection cover was properly replaced.''
   _The airline flew a DC-10 ``in an unairworthy condition several
flights between 2@1@88 and 2@11@88'' because it ``failed to
neutralize or identify the exact cause'' of a problem with a gauge
that monitored turbine speed in the jet's No. 3 engine.
   _A Boeing 747 ``experienced over 40 repeat discrepancies
relating (to) performance problems on installed engines. During
this period from Sept. 27, 1987, through Jan. 13, one fuel control
and two engines were replaced.''

   Soybean futures prices plunged as much as 9 cents
a bushel Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late sell-off
led by large investment funds. Grain futures closed mixed to lower.
   A combination of bearish factors, including weak export demand
and expectations of a large South American soybean harvest, had
weighed on the soybean market for most of the week.
   Heavy selling of soybean futures by the Chicago-based
professional trading firm C&D Commodities late in Friday's session
sparked fear among other traders that soybean futures prices had
reached a seasonal peak, analysts said.
   ``What you're really getting here is a delayed winter break that
was expected back in January or February, and it's coming now,''
said Richard Loewy, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Wheat futures were supported by some new export bids and by news
that the Agriculture Department had sold much less surplus wheat
than expected in an auction on Wednesday.
   Corn exports were down for the week, which set a bullish tone
for corn futures, Loewy said.
   At the close, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.03} a bushel; corn was 1\
cents to 2\ cents lower with March at $1.99{ a bushel; oats were }

<TEXT>
   J.P. Morgan & Co. said Friday that it expects to
have a charge to allowance-for-credit losses as a result of its
participation in Mexico's debt-for-securities swap aimed at
reducing that country's $105 billion foreign debt.
   The large bank holding company said Mexico accepted about $400
million face value of Morgan's Mexican loans tendered at last
week's auction.
   In exchange for the loans, Morgan said, it will be receiving
about $263 million face value of new Mexican bonds. The face value
of the loans is about 66 percent of the loans that were tendered.
   The Mexican government announced Thursday that it accepted 55
percent of the $6.7 billion in bids that 139 creditor banks
submitted under the unique swap plan.
   The plan calls for Mexico to issue more than $2.5 billion in
new, 20-year bonds to its creditor banks to replace $3.66 billion
in old bank debt, an exchange that will save Mexico over $2.6
billion over 20 years. The bonds are backed by U.S. Treasury
securities.
   In a statement, Morgan said ``as a result of acceptance of the
loans ... a loss determined by the difference between the book
value of the loans tendered and the fair value of the bonds
received will be charged against the allowance for credit losses in
the first quarter.''
   The amount of the credit loss provision will be determined at
the end of the period, the company said.

<HEAD>Retail Takeover Climate: Reinvigorated After Post-Crash Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover battles for retail companies, mostly
dormant after the stock market crash, exploded into out-and-out war
this past week as R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. and Campeau Corp. fought
over who will acquire Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Macy and Campeau had competing tender offers for Federated's
stock, and although Macy and Federated signed a definitive
agreement, by week's end no one was sure who would win.
   Federated, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, is a likely
takeover target. The company owns more than 650 department,
specialty and discount stores and supermarkets, including the
Bloomingdale's, Burdine's, Lazarus and Bullock's department store
chains.
   Mergers and acquisitions in retailing and other industries were
sharply curtailed after the Oct. 19 stock market collapse. Many
pending takeover attempts were abandoned, including Dart Group
Corp.'s $6.62 billion bid for Dayton Hudson Corp., the nation's
sixth-largest retailer.
   But several factors have combined to revitalize takeovers in
many business sectors.
   ``Relatively low stock prices have lured companies into starting
tender offers,'' said Peter Solomon, co-head of investment banking
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Retail stock prices began to slip before the crash, and remain
depressed now because of sluggish consumer spending. A lower stock
price makes it easier for a prospective suitor to finance a
takeover.
   The lower dollar has made American companies a relative bargain
for foreigners, such as Australia's Hooker Corp. Ltd., which in
recent months has acquired B. Altman & Co. in New York and Sakowitz
Inc. in Houston.
   There are political factors, too, including the upcoming
presidential election, said Monroe H. Greenstein, a retail industry
analyst for the investment firm Bear Stearns & Co. Inc.
   ``You have an administration here that has a very liberal
interpretation of antitrust laws, which means they're almost not
enforced,'' said Greenstein.
   No matter who succeeds Ronald Reagan in the White House, it is
doubtful the relaxed attitude will survive the change in
administrations, so many would-be acquirers want to buy companies
while there is a more favorable climate, Greenstein said.
   In addition, more and more states are passing anti-takeover
laws, and investors want to make their acquisitions before it
becomes too difficult, he said.
   For existing retail companies, buying another retailer means
immediate growth. Solomon noted that few shopping centers are being
built, which cuts down the opportunities for retailers to expand.
Analysts see this as the primary reason for Macy's interest in
Federated.
   Greenstein cited another benefit of acquiring a retail company:
real estate and store divisions that can be sold or mortgaged to
help finance the acquisition.
   When Campeau bought Allied Stores Corp. at the end of 1986, he
sold 16 of its 24 store divisions to pay off loans taken out to
acquire Allied. He has already announced he will sell Federated's
Foley's and Filene's divisions to the May Department Stores Co. if
his tender offer is successful.
   Campeau, a shopping center developer, is said to be interested
in Federated because many of its stores will provide him with
immediate access to malls.
   One analyst sees the battle over Federated as having
ramifications that could affect the direction of retailing for
years to come.
   Whoever wins Federated ``would be sitting in the seat to
determine whether the major companies get larger or whether you're
going to see entrepreneurs spurring growth in the industry,'' said
Thomas Tashjian, who tracks retailers for Seidler Amdec Securities
Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Larger companies may not promote change, he said, adding,
``You're going to end up seeing the same thing everywhere.''
   When smaller companies or management groups buy retailers, they
may be more inclined to change and update stores, Tashjian said.
   After Dillard Department Store Inc. bought the Joske's
department store chain from Allied Stores, ``they improved the
profitability of those stores. They improved the customers'
selection. They improved the pricing structure,'' Tashjian said.
   Campeau said it had no plans to sell any Federated divisions
beyond Foley's and Filene's, but their sale to May, the nation's
seventh-largest retailer, was bad news to Tashjian.
   ``Filene's and Foley's, which have distinct franchises, may
start to look like a May-California or a Lord & Taylor,'' two of
May's other department store divisions, he said.
   Macy is also a large retailer, but it is more likely than
Campeau to re-energize Federated's stores, having rejuvenated its
own stores, Tashjian said.

   Federated was not the only retailer at the center of a takeover
battle this past week. On Monday, Stop & Shop Cos., which had been
fighting a takeover attempt by Dart Group Corp., announced it had
agreed to a $1.2 billion buyout by the investment company Kohlberg,
Kravis Roberts Inc. But Dart said it remained intent on gaining
control of the retailer.
   The bid for Stop & Shop was the first takeover foray by Dart
since its run at Dayton Hudson.
   In other retailing news, Sears, Roebuck and Co., the nation's
largest retailer, said it was restructuring its merchandise group
to make each segment of its retail business more competitive.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _In contrasting reports on consumer spending, the nation's
largest general retailers said sales were unexpectedly slow in
February, while carmakers said sales of domestic cars and trucks
increased 25 percent late in the month, compared with a year ago.
   _The Labor Department said the nation's economy created half a
million jobs last month, dropping the civilian unemployment rate to
5.7 percent, its lowest level since the summer of 1979.
   _The government's chief barometer of future economic activity
fell again in January, but an upward revision in December eased
fears of an imminent recession.
   _The National Association of Business Economists said the
October stock market crash would contribute to a significant
slowdown in economic growth this year but the country should be
able to avoid a recession.
   _Widespread weakness in the building industry sent construction
spending down 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10
months, the Commerce Department said. Meanwhile, a 9 percent
decline in new home sales in January pushed sales activity to its
slowest pace since the end of the last recession.
   _Improvement in the nation's productivity slowed by almost half
last year despite revised figures showing higher output in the the
fourth quarter, the government said.
   _The Commerce Department reported a 0.6 percent decline in
orders to U.S. factories for manufactured goods in January, the
first setback since August.
   _The Democratic-controlled House labor standards subcommittee
voted to increase the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.65 an hour over
the next three years.
   _The Agriculture Department said prices farmers got for raw
products in February declined an average of 0.8 percent from
January but still were 6.6 percent above those a year earlier.
   _A management group led by GAF Corp.'s chairman raised its
buyout bid for the company to $1.4 billion, and the board of
directors agreed to submit the offer to shareholders ``without
endorsement.''
   _A bidding war erupted for textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co. with
rival West Point-Pepperell Inc. offering to buy the company for
about $867 million in cash and a management-led group jumping its
cash and securities offer to about $850 million. Stevens also said
it had a third, unidentified offer.
   _Batus Inc. raised its hostile bid for a controlling interest in
Farmers Group Inc., with a $4.5 billion offer for the nation's
seventh largest insurer.
   _A group led by a British construction firm launched an
unsolicited tender offer for Koppers Co. Inc. that valued the
construction and chemicals company at about $1.3 billion.
   _The partnership controlled by T. Boone Pickens Jr. offered to
buy Homestake Mining Co., the nation's largest gold producer, for
about $1.9 billion in cash.
   _Two companies controlled by television producer Burt Sugarman
proposed taking over Virginia-based newspaper publisher and
broadcaster Media General Inc. for $1.75 billion. Media General
rejected the offer.
   _Southland Corp. said it would sell 473 7-Eleven stores in 10
states to its chief competitor, Circle K Corp., for more than $147
million.
   _The directors of holding companies for Dr Pepper and Seven-Up
agreed to merge the privately-held soft-drink companies. Terms were
not disclosed.
   _The Federal Aviation Administration revealed that Northwest
Airlines committed a number of safety violations, including the
improper delay of repairs and the failure to ensure that pilots
flew no longer than allowed.
   _Chrysler Motors Corp. decided not to sell its Acustar Inc.
parts-making subsidiary but said it will close or sell four plants
within the next 18 months.
   _Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund firm,
said a slump in stock transaction would force it to lay off 800
workers.
   _Major airlines raised fares for the second time in about two
weeks, reflecting unexpected strength in passenger traffic despite
the usually slow winter season.
   _Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Congress
should consider trimming Social Security and other entitlement
programs as it searches for ways to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
   _Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker was named to a professorship
at Princeton University and the chairmanship of James D. Wolfensohn
Inc., a New York City investment banking firm.

   Shareholders of First City Bancorporation of
Texas Inc. gathered Friday to consider Chicago banker A. Robert
Abboud's $1.5 billion rescue plan that would be the largest
government bank bailout since 1984.
   A two-thirds vote of the bank-holding company's 37 million
shares is required to approve the plan, which includes nearly $1
billion in federal assistance, a spin-off of poorly performing
assets and an infusion of privately-raised capital.
   First City, which grew quickly during the oil boom to become the
state's fourth-largest bank, was hammered by energy and real estate
loan losses when oil prices plummeted.
   For 1987, the company posted a $1.1 billion loss. It has assets
of $11 billion, and operates 59 banks in Texas and one in South
Dakota.
   Abboud, an investor seeking to become First City's chairman of
the board and chief executive officer, has promised banking
regulators to rehabilitate the wobbly company.
   In a 200-page, single-spaced proxy statement sent to
shareholders, Abboud said an investor group he heads would raise
$500 million to serve as the primary source of capital for the
restructured company.
   In addition, First City subsidiary banks would spin off $1.79
billion in book value of non-performing and other assets to
Collecting Bank, a new national bank.
   In exchange, First City would receive about $764 million in
Collecting Bank notes and about $970 million in Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. notes.
   The FDIC pledge is the largest such government rescue since the
1984 federal bailout of Continental Illinois Bank and Trust of
Chicago.
   The proxy statement predicted the new company would become
profitable almost immediately, after spinning off the
poorly-performing assets.
   Abboud declined comment until after Friday's voting, said First
City spokesman Jim Day. Abboud has said he hopes to finalize the
rescue within weeks of shareholder approval.
   Under the reorganization plan, each 100 shares of First City
common stock would be exchanged for one common share of the new
holding company, 100 shares of common stock in Collecting Bank and
the right to buy more securities in the new company.
   The restructuring plan was first announced Sept. 9. It was
modified on Jan. 26 to allow common shareholders and the four
classes of preferred shareholders to vote as one group.
   The first plan had called for each class to vote on the plan
separately, with a rejection from any one group sufficient to
scuttle the deal.
   The earlier arrangement inadvertently provided rancher Frederick
Erck, a San Antonio preferred stockholder, potential veto power
over the deal.
   Erck, a former First City director who resigned in November, has
said he opposes the deal, not only because it could hurt him
financially, but because Abboud's team would reap too much profit
from the restructured company.
   Erck said he did not plan to attend Friday's meeting, and did
not disclose how he planned to vote.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said
Thursday its fourth-quarter profit climbed more than tenfold from a
year earlier mostly because of the sale of assets.
   Harcourt, which has interests in publishing, insurance and theme
parks, reported a profit of $95.1 million, or $1.36 a share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31, 1987, compared with earnings of $8.9
million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 21.4 percent to $327.6 million from
$269.9 million a year earlier.
   The company completed the sale of its business periodicals,
trade shows and school supply distribution companies for $334
million and of two television station for $10.8 million in the
quarter.
   The latest results included a onetime gain on disposal of assets
of $136.9 million and income from discontinued operations of $141.6
million.
   The sales fulfilled the company's asset sale obligation incurred
when it borrowed to finance a recapitalization last May that helped
it avoid a hostile takeover bid from British publisher Robert
Maxwell.
   Interest expense in the latest quarter shot up to $78.5 million
from $6.1 million a year earlier, and the company said it had a
loss from continuing operations of $46.4 million in the latest
quarter in contrast to a profit of $6.2 million a year earlier.
   For the year, Harcourt reported net income of $90.5 million, or
$1.34 a share, up from $70.5 million, or $1.91 a share, a year
earlier.
   The decline in per share earnings reflected an increase in the
average number of shares for the year to 48.1 million from 37
million in 1986.
   Revenue for the year rose to $1.52 billion from $1.11 billion a
year earlier.

   South Korea plans to send a
large-scale buying mission to the United States in May as part of
its effort to ease growing trade frictions with Washington,
government and industry officials said Friday.
   The mission, to be headed by Nam Duck-woo, president of the
Korea Foreign Trade Association, will tour various U.S. cities for
15 days to purchase machinery and other industrial products, the
officials said.
   Details of the mission's itinerary and shopping list have not
yet been fixed, officials said.
   In the past, South Korea sent buying missions to the United
States once or twice a year to help ease trade frictions.
   The United States is pressuring South Korea to open its market
wider to American products to cut its growing trade surplus. The
United States ran a trade deficit of $9.5 billion with South Korea
last year.
