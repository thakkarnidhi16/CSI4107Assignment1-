<HEAD>Rakowski Says Poland Doesn't Need Solidarity To Achieve Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski says
his new government is less broadly based than he wanted because
four opposition members refused to join his Cabinet.
   ``In my opinion (opposition) entry into the goverment would have
changed quite strongly the political situation in Poland and
created a new situation favorable to the idea of national
reconciliation,'' Rakowski said.
   Rakowski spoke at his first news conference as prime minister
Friday just after the Sejm, or parliament, voted 363-1 to approve a
Cabinet made up mostly of members of the ruling Polish United
Workers' Party, the communist party.
   When asked what role the outlawed trade union Solidarity was
playing, Rakowski said: ``I don't limit democratization to the
recognition of Solidarity. I don't think that the restoration of
Solidarity may be proof of the fact that our country is becoming
more democratic. ''
   But a Catholic deputy said in a Parliament speech Friday that
authorities must regard Solidarity, the first independent union in
the Soviet bloc, as a permanent fixture of the political scene.
   ``There is no doubt that union pluralism is today a basic but
one of the many problems to be solved from the wide package of
reform which awaits us,'' Zygmunt Kostarczyk said.
   Rakowski had left open four Cabinet positions for what he called
members of the ``constructive opposition,'' but said opposition
figures refused to join his government.
   Rakowski said he offered Cabinet posts to Catholic church
adviser Witold Trzeciakowski, independent economist Julian
Auleytner, Catholic intellectual Andrzej Micewski and journalist
Alexander Paszynski.
   When he was named prime minister Sept. 27, Rakowski said he
hoped to broaden the communist-dominated government and gain
popular support.
   The Cabinet, which Rakowski nominated Thursday, includes a new
generation of young party members to oversee economic affairs, but
senior party members retained the key interior, defense and foreign
ministries. In all, Parliament approved nine new ministers.
   One of Rakowski's chief tasks as prime minister will be to
revive the failing economy. Inflation stands at 60 percent.
Consumer goods from cheese to winter coats are in short supply, and
workers continue to press for wage increases.
   Rakowski declined to say exactly when the round-table talks with
Solidarity and he seemed cautious about the results.
   ``I am against getting excited about the round table,'' he said.
``We will see how the first round will go, what kinds of positions
or views will appear.
   Solidarity was crushed with the imposition of martial law in
1981.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa agreed to end a wave of strikes in
August after the government agreed to round-table talks on the
future of Solidarity.
   In a related development, about fifty miners dismissed from
their jobs after the strikes demonstrated outside the communist
party headquarters in Warsaw Friday, eyewitnesses said.
   They held up banners saying, ``We don't want to overthrow the
round table, We demand only to have our jobs back.''
   Solidarity has said it will discuss dismissals and repression of
former strikers at the round-table talks.
   Rakowski replaced Zbigniew Messner, whose Cabinet resigned Sept.
19 after criticism for mishandling the party-approved economic
reform program. It was the first time the entire government stepped
down in postwar Poland.

   The head of the Anti-Defamation League wants
the Justice Department to explain why it did not reveal that
Boleslavs Maikovskis, allegedly a Nazi collaborator, fled the
United States while awaiting deportation to the Soviet Union.
   Maikovskis, 83, secretly left the United States and is believed
to be in West Germany, a government source said Friday on condition
that he not be identified. The source said he did not know when
Maikovskis left.
   ``The whole thing is a little bit strange,'' ADL National
Director Abraham Foxman said in a telephone interview from New
York. ``We are baffled why the secrecy around this issue.''
   Maikovskis, a Latvian, had been living in Mineola, N.Y., since
1951. He had been awaiting deportation since 1986 when the Supreme
Court turned down his appeal.
   Maikovskis' departure came to light Friday after the ADL issued
a press release urging Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to conduct
an ``immediate investigation into Maikovskis' whereabouts and
prompt action to bring him to justice.''
   Foxman said the ADL confirmed Thursday that Maikovskis was
missing from his Mineola home and called the Justice Department to
report it.
   ``They said in confidence they know that he's missing and they
know where he is,'' Foxman said. ``So we said, `Why don't you tell
the American people?' They said they can't do that.''
   Foxman then decided to go public with the only information ADL
could confirm: that Maikovskis was no longer in Mineola.
   Neal Sher, director of the Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations, confirmed that Maikovskis had left the
United States, but declined to say where he had gone or how the
department knew this.
   ``We have just learned after a massive investigation to find
this guy ... that in fact he is out of the country and in effect
the deportation order has been effectuated,'' Sher said.
   He also said there was nothing further for the Justice
Department to investigate. ``His being brought to justice is out of
our hands,'' Sher said.
   But Foxman said his group wants to know under what circumstances
Maikovskis left, when, whether he will be brought to trial, and
whether the U.S. government has any agreement with the Germans.
   Sher suggested that the ADL deal with German authorities.
   Maikovskis had been a chief of a Nazi-created police force in
Latvia during World War II. He is accused of having ordered the
mass arrest of residents in the Latvian village of Audrini and then
burning the town. The 200 villagers were later killed by the Nazis.
   Maikovskis was sentenced to death in absentia in the Soviet
Union in 1965. Deportation proceedings against Maikovskis began in
the United States in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals.
His deportation was upheld by a federal Court of Appeals in 1985
and his final appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.
   Maikovskis had designated Switzerland as the country to which he
wanted to be deported, but that country refused him and he faced
deportation to the Soviet Union.
   In fact, OSI filed papers on Oct. 7 redesignating the Soviet
Union as Maikovskis' deportation destination, Sher said, but
Maikovskis apparently was already gone by then.
   ``He saw the handwriting on the wall,'' Sher said, pointing to
the case of accused Nazi collaborator Karl Linnas, who was deported
last year to the Soviet Union. Linnas, also of Long Island, died
before he could be tried.
   Elan Steinberg, head of the World Jewish Congress, said
Maikovskis' departure was ``a tribute to OSI.''
   ``The most important thing we were concerned about was getting
him out of the country,'' Steinberg said.

<HEAD>Top Dukakis Aide Dragged From NRC Hearing On Massachusetts Reactor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has apologized to Gov. Michael Dukakis' top aide on
atomic power issues, who was dragged out of a commission meeting
after trying to speak from the audience during a discussion on the
reopening of a Massachusetts reactor.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. drafted a letter to Peter Agnes
late Friday, about an hour after the Massachusetts assistant public
safety commissioner was forcibly removed from the NRC hearing room.
   Zech said he regreted the ``unfortunate incident,'' explaining
that he did not recognize Agnes.
   ``I hope you understand the need for us to exercise some control
at our commission hearings so scheduled presentations can be made
in an orderly manner,'' Zech wrote.
   Agnes, who was in the audience, stood up while NRC officials
were telling commissioners that the Pilgrim plant in Plymouth,
Mass., was ready to open after a 2{-year shutdown even though it
did not have an approved emergency evacuation plan.
   Agnes, who has been working with local and federal officials to
create acceptable evacuation plans for the suburban towns
surrounding the plant, was immediately approached by several NRC
security guards.
   When he continued to stand and address the commission, the
guards grabbed him by both arms. As he yelled that he was tired of
hearing ``half-truths,'' Agnes was pulled from the row over several
other spectators and dragged out of the hearing room.
   He was not arrested, but was barred from the building.
   ``I simply could not sit there any longer, after having worked
on this project for two years with state and local officials, and
hear the falsehoods, half-truths and misrepresentations that the
NRC staff was making about emergency planning. It was absolutely
disgraceful. My concern was that we were reaching a decision point
and that the commissioners ought to know that at least one public
safety official from the commonwealth took exception with what they
said,'' Agnes said.
   The commission declined to make an immediate ruling. Zech said
the commission needed time to review testimony presented earlier in
the day by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and other state officials as well
as the NRC staff's recommendations.
   The commission usually does not hear public comment at such
meetings. They made an exception for Kennedy, Lt. Gov. Evelyn
Murphy and Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., but refused to allow
other state officials and local residents to speak.
   Dukakis and other state officials have urged the NRC to keep the
670-megawatt reactor shut down until an acceptable emergency
evacuation plan is installed and tested. Last year, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency said the previous plan was unacceptable.
   But NRC officials, in their briefing to the commissioners, said
the original management and equipment problems that triggered the
shutdown on April 12, 1986, have been resolved. They added that
evacuation planning, while not completed, is greatly improved and
should not halt the reopening of the plant.
   Agnes acknowledged he did not expect to be allowed to present
testimony, but said he never expected to be physically removed.
   ``I certainly didn't expect to get dragged out of the hall,'' he
said. ``I assumed the chairman would have turned and said, `Mr.
Agnes, you're out of order,' or `we won't hear you'.''
   ``To impose a regime like they have here today, where people
aren't even permitted to stand and request permission to speak, I
think is a very frightening spectacle,'' he added.
   Earlier, Stephen Comley, a gadfly anti-nuclear activist, was
removed by security guards when he held up a ``Chernobyl'' poster.

<HEAD>Polisario Says Rifts Persist With Morocco on Western Sahara</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Morocco and the independence movement in
the Western Sahara are sharply split on whether they can put away
their guns and negotiate face-to-face, despite agreeing in
principle to peace.
   Morocco and the Polisario independence movement remain far apart
on most issues, said Bachir M. Sayed, an official of the
Marxist-led movement says.
   Sayed said Friday that both sides so far have only agreed on the
wording of a referendum on the future of the arid northwest African
territory, and on how voter eligibility will be decided.
   Sayed said issues dividing the two sides include the 185,000
Moroccan soldiers in the phosphate-rich territory; the Moroccan
administration; the tens of thousands of Moroccan settlers living
in Western Sahara; existing Moroccan law in the area; and ``direct
negotiations, still opposed by Morocco.
   ``Morocco still refuses to shake our hand for peace,'' Sayed
said. ``It is proof of their lack of political will.''
   A Moroccan official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``They want to renegotiate everything. But we say we did come up
with a peace plan that was agreed to by both parties.''
   ``We are not going to preempt the population by giving anybody
legitimacy,'' the official added. ``The people of Western Sahara
will decide who shall lead them, and whether these people
(Polisario) will lead them.''
   Sayed said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will
appoint a Uruguayan diplomat, Hector S. Piaolillo, to be his
special representative for the region.
   Piaolillo is a law professor who has served as a special
observer on human rights in Central America, the Uruguayan Mission
in New York said.
   The United Nations also plans to send about 2,000 peacekeeping
troops to the Western Sahara to monitor the referendum.
   On Sept. 20, Perez de Cuellar informed the Security Council that
Morocco and Polisario ``while making comments and observations,
agreed ... to the proposals for a peaceful settlement put forward
by the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity and
myself.''
   Those proposals, he said, included the framework for a
cease-fire in the nearly 13-year-old guerrilla war and a referendum
to decide whether the territory will become an independent nation
or become affiliated with Morocco.
   When the Spanish colonial administration withdrew from their
former possession in 1975, Moroccan troops occupied the Western
Sahara and the Polisario movement began the fight for independence.
   At least 10,000 people have died in the war, which has cost
Morocco up to $2 million a day to fight.
   The desert territory covers about 110,000 square miles, and its
population at the last Spanish census in 1974 was 76,000 people.
   Among the lingering areas of disagreement, Sayed said, are the
presence of Moroccan troops in the territory. Morocco wants all
185,000 soldiers it has in the area to remain, Sayed said.
   Sayed said 7,000 Moroccan troops should be allowed to remain in
the Western Sahara during the referendum, and should be confined to
barracks, like the approximately 7,000 Polisario fighters who will
confined to camps under U.N. supervision.
   The other Moroccan soldiers should withdraw to their homeland,
he contended.

<TEXT>
   A youth organization has demanded
free elections and there were indications today at least two
members of the ruling Politburo will resign at a crucial Communist
Party meeting.
   The party's 164-member Central Committee is to meet Monday
hoping to resolve the ethnic, economic and political unrest that
have placed Yugoslavia in its worst social crisis since World War
II.
   While the Central Committee makes overall policy decisions, the
23-member Politburo carries out the day-to-day control of the party
and government.
   Demands expressed Friday at political meetings in four of
Yugoslavia's six republics and the Kosovo province ranged from
calls by the official youth organization in Slovenia to end
one-party rule to Serbian appeals for the resignation of Communist
Party chief Stipe Suvar.
   In Kosovo, one ethnic Albanian leader announced he was willing
to resign from the Politburo at the national Central Committee
meeting, according to news reports from the autonomous province.
   Milanko Renovica, a former national party chief, announced
Friday he will resign from the Politburo.
   The Kosovo party leadership is trying to deal with disputes
between the Slav minority and the majority of ethnic Albanians.
Kosovo is an autonomous province in Serbia and Serbians are
insisting on more control, claiming harassment by the predominantly
Moslem Albanians. Most of the Slavs are Christians.
   Tanjug, the state news agency, reported three members of the
national Central Committee from Kosovo, including former President
Sinan Hasani, are willing to resign from the committee.
   The ethnic unrest that began in Kosovo has spread to broader
protests over the nation's battered economy.
   In Slovenia the official Communist youth organization issued a
statement demanding direct elections, independent trade unions, the
abolition of news censorship and termination of the one-party
system.
   It compared rallies and tactics of the Serbian Communist Party
to centralize control with those of the Nazis in Germany before
World War II.
   ``In Serbia they are manipulating with the masses in the same
way as was done in Germany between the two World Wars,'' it said.
   Several Serbian Communist groups, including the influential
Belgrade organization, demanded Suvar's resignation after he
criticized the Serbian leaders earlier in the week.
   Belgrade party chief Rados Smijlkovic claimed Suvar wants to
turn Monday's meeting into an indictment of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
largest republic.
   Mass rallies in recent weeks have pushed Serbia's demand for
more control over the nation's two autonomous provinces _ Kosovo
and Vojvodina.
   The rallies alarmed non-Serbian leaders who organized
anti-government protests and last weekend authorities used force to
break up demonstrations in the southern republic of Montenegro.
   There also have been more worker protests since May when the
government ordered an austerity program that increased prices while
reducing wages.
   Belgrade newspapers reported Friday that the government will
ease the austerity program, increasing wages for workers in
profitable companies and in such social services as health and
education.
   But a new price increase took effect Saturday with the
government announcing the price of cooking oil would almost double
to the equivalent of $1.25 per quart.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. Serbia
is the largest republic and both provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina,
are part of it but not fully subject to its control.
   The decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in former President Josip Broz Tito's 1974
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the
others, but has resulted in an ineffective government by compromise.

   Michael Dukakis is counting on making himself
more familiar and likable through a trio of TV ads that feature the
Massachusetts governor speaking directly to viewers about their
families and the nation.
   The starkly simple ads show Dukakis in his shirt sleeves on a
couch and in a suit standing behind a chair. He speaks of family
concerns in two spots, of the country's slipping international
economic status in the third.
   ``They're one more attempt to give the American people a chance
to know who Mike Dukakis is,'' said Dukakis spokeswoman Lorraine
Voles. ``Obviously, we feel if they know who he is they're going to
like him.''
   Voles said the ads, which began Friday, were the only ones
scheduled to run nationally through the weekend.
   Though the consensus is that Republican George Bush won the
Thursday night debate between the two presidential rivals, Voles
said the event gave Dukakis a chance to ``talk positively about his
message in front of the American people.''
   ``The ads are a good followup to the debate,'' she said. ``They
lay out more of who Mike Dukakis really is and where he wants to
take this country.''
   The Bush campaign also unveiled a new national television spot
at the end of the week, keyed to the nuclear arms reduction treaty
President Reagan signed with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The ad shows pictures of Americans riding a tractor, reading on
a porch and eating dinner as a narrator discusses the day the
Soviets began destroying missiles under the new treaty.
   ``And though most Americans were unaware of the significance of
the moment, or realized it was George Bush who led the way, someday
their grandchildren will,'' the narrator concludes over a shot of
Bush with one of his grandchildren in a swing.
   The new Dukakis ads mark a departure from the campaign's other
efforts, which have included direct hits at Bush and a string of
controversial, highly polished ads seeking to depict Bush as a
packaged candidate with no substance.
   In one spot, Dukakis discusses the ``daily challenge'' of
finding day care, the threat of drugs, and the need for two-earner
households ``to stay even.''
   ``The Republicans say that the future's never been brighter,''
Dukakis says. ``But if I were a young father today, I'd want to
know that my government wasn't blind to the changes in my life. ...
That's not a Democratic concern. It's not a Republican concern.
That's a father's concern.''
   In a second ad, Dukakis says the nation isn't leading the world
anymore in education or international trade, and ``instead of
people owing us, we owe them.''
   ``How did we let this happen?'' he asks. ``Well, I think instead
of looking for new answers, we went with the old ones. Instead of
doing the right thing, we began doing the easy thing. And now we're
in danger of falling behind. I'm not going to let that happen. ...
I believe the best America is yet to come.''
   The third ad is a 30-second version of the family spot.
   With the introduction of its back-to-basics approach, the
campaign pulled off the air after only one day the latest in its
``Packaging of George Bush'' series. The ads, six in all, feature a
group of actors playing cynical Bush handlers who mock different
aspects of Bush's record as they try to figure out ways to make him
palatable to voters.
   Voles said the removal of the latest ``packaging'' ad was not a
response to complaints about the series, which many commentators
have branded elitist and obscure. ``You may very well be seeing
that ad along with the other packaging ads again,'' she said.
   In addition, an official said another new ad will begin airing
in Texas, with Lloyd Bentsen delivering a testimonial to Dukakis
and asking supporters in his home state to rally behind the
Democratic ticket.
   Dukakis also plans to make extensive use of offers to appear on
television news programs, including ABC's ``Nightline,'' campaign
aides said.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis campaigned on the West Coast
sounding environmental themes as a pair of post-debate surveys
showed the vice president widening his lead over the Massachusetts
governor.
   The Democratic and Republican presidential candidates both
lingered in California on Friday after their debate the night
before.
   Dukakis took a side trip to Seattle before returning for a
breakfast this morning in Los Angeles for campaign volunteers.
   Bush had a series of tours and rallies around the Golden State,
where 47 electoral votes are up for grabs.
   Both candidates paid close attention to environmental issues,
which are close to the fore among voters along the West Coast.
   Bush, speaking at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in San
Diego, said for the first time that ``we should take a very close
look'' at environmental concerns before going ahead with ocean
drilling in the Santa Monica Bay and adjacent areas off the
Southern California coast.
   Previously, Bush supported a delay in any oil and gas drilling
in a scenic tract in Northern California pending study of
environmental factors.
   Environmentalists oppose drilling in either site.
   Bush also said that one of his first priorities if elected would
be winning passage of stronger clean-air laws.
   He also promised to convene a global conference on the
environment, maintaining that most of the major environmental
problems, including acid rain, warming of the Earth and
deterioration of the oceans, ``are truly international in nature.''
   Dukakis had one of his largest crowds ever when thousands of
people waited more than an hour in a Seattle rain to hear his call
for ``clean air, clean water, a clean coastline and clean
government.''
   Buoyed by the crowd after what most regarded as a losing debate
to Bush, Dukakis went back on the attack.
   ``Think of where we'll be four years from now if we elect a man
who thinks Ed Meese was a great attorney general; who thinks that
James Watt did an excellent job as secretary of the interior; who
thinks, as he said last night, that Robert Bork would have made an
outstanding member of the Supreme Court; and that Dan Quayle is the
man best qualified in his party to be one heartbeat away from the
leadership of the free world,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, judged the debate winner in flash polls taken immediately
after the Thursday night encounter, apparently is translating that
verdict into potential votes as well.
   A poll of 529 debate viewers by The Los Angeles Times found Bush
now favored over Dukakis, 52 percent to 42 percent. A CBS survey of
442 viewers showed Bush was preferred by a margin of 54-43.
   Both national surveys had a margin of error of plus or minus 5
percentage points.
   Bush said he wouldn't be lulled into complacency because of the
polling data favoring him.
   ``You're talking to a guy who, when the polls were going the
other way, I said it wasn't over,'' Bush said aboard Air Force 2.
``It wasn't, so why should I now suddenly have the luxury of
changing my position.''
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, also
campaigning in California, followed the Dukakis lead in going after
Bush. ``Debating George Bush is just like trying to eat Jell-O with
a fork,'' the Texas senator told a crowd in Sacramento.
   In Fort Smith, Ark., Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle predicted he would become less of an issue as the campaign
enters its final weeks, ``because the American people are trying to
make up their minds about the top of the ticket.

   A man was charged Friday in the beating
death of the 8-year-old daughter of the leader of a Los
Angeles-based religious group once known as Ecclesia.
   Dayna Lorea Broussard had been beaten and whipped, said state
Medical Examiner Larry Lewman. The girl apparently lived at one of
two homes outside Portland occupied by children and others
affiliated with the group.
   Police charged Willie K. Chambers, of Los Angeles, with murder
and three others with hindering prosecution.
   The four adults brought the child to a Clackamas County fire
station in the rural Happy Valley area about 20 miles east of
Portland. The child was dead on arrival at the fire station,
authorities said.
   County sheriff's deputies removed 55 children from a house in
Happy Valley Friday and a state agency was seeking custody, said
Alice Galloway, spokeswoman for the Oregon Children's Services
Division.
   Carolyn Van Brunt, dean of the Watts Christian Center school and
training program in Los Angeles, said the dead girl was the
daughter of Eldridge Broussard Jr., who founded the Ecclesia
Athletic Association in the Watts area of Los Angeles as a combined
religious-recreational institution in 1975.
   She said the girl was one of about 50 children from the center
who had spent the summer months in Oregaon. She said the child's
father had been in Los Angeles developing a youth center.
   Broussard, who played basketball as a freshman at the University
of Oregon and later starred as a basketball player for Pacific
University in Forest Grove, Ore., once defined Ecclesia's Christian
mission as recreation of people's attitudes and goals through
recreation.
   The group developed a 32-team basketball league and opened a

   A small, overloaded ferry boat
sank in heavy seas in the central Philippines, and at least 55
people drowned, the Coast Guard reported today. It said 77 were
rescued.
   The vessel is authorized to carry 92 people. Officials did not
say if they had accounted for everyone who had been on board.
   The 35-ton motor boat met a wind gust and big waves before
sinking off the southern tip of Samar island early Friday, the
Coast Guard report said.
   The boat, which left the town of Giporlos, was bound for
Tacloban city on the neighboring island of Leyte, the report said.

   Emperor Hirohito was in stable condition today
after experiencing a high temperature the previous day, but his
internal bleeding continued, officials said.
   The 87-year-old emperor's condition is ``leveling off,'' Kenji
Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency, told reporters.
   Quoting Akira Takagi, the chief court physician, Maeda added
that doctors were not planning to give Hirohito additional blood
transfusions despite signs of slight bleeding sometime between
Friday night and Saturday morning.
   Maeda said the emperor's temperature fell to 99.5, compared to
100.6 Friday night. Hirohito's normal temperature is believed to be
95.9.
   The emperor's temperature has constantly hovered around
96.8-98.6 and occasionally peaked over 100.4 since he fell ill
after vomiting blood Sept. 19 from internal hemorrhaging.
   Physicians have attributed the stubborn fever to an inflammation
of the bile duct and bleeding from the upper duodenum, and are
worried about the possible recurrence of a large amount of blood
discharge, the local media have said.
   Palace officials have also expressed worry over Hirohito's
worsening jaundice and the world's longest-reigning monarch living
has occasionally complained of fatigue, according to the news
reports.
   Japan's post-World War II Constitution reduced the emperor's
role from living god to ``the symbol of state and of the unity of
the people'' and allows him only ceremonial duties.

   An air force officer arrested for
taking part in a coup attempt was fatally wounded by guards today
as he tried to scale a wall of his military prison, the armed
forces said.
   Lt. Col. Francisco Baula, accused in a 1987 attempted coup that
left 53 people dead and more than 300 wounded, died at a military
hospital about nine hours after his bid to escape from the suburban
Camp Crame stockade, military officials said.
   Last year's military uprising, led by former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, was the most serious effort to oust the
government of President Corazon Aquino. She came to power in
February 1986 after a military-civilian uprising ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos, who fled to Hawaii.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, said Baula was shot and wounded three times after he
refused to halt and ignored warning shots. The stockade is located
at the constabulary.
   Montano said Baula slipped into a dark corner of the stockade
shortly after midnight and tried to climb over the wall with a
makeshift ladder.
   Percival Adiong, the Camp Crame commandant, said Baula used
wooden slats and the two frames of his double-decker bed to make
the ladder.
   ``Our investigation shows that there were no others who tried to
help him,'' Montano said.
   Baula was arrested Oct. 3 with two other military men sought in
connection with the coup attempt on Aug. 28, 1987.
   Honasan remains at large. He was jailed last December but
escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay the following April.

   The United States will continue to withhold part
of its United Nations dues this year until a key U.N. committee
approves a new austerity budget and other administrative changes
occur, administration officials say.
   United Nations officials say the action is contributing to a new
cash crisis the organization might face later this year, The New
York Times reported in its Saturday editions.
   President Reagan last month ordered the immediate payment of $44
million in outstanding U.S. dues owed for fiscal 1988, which ended
Sept. 30. He said he was satisfied the organization was making good
progress in carrying out administrative changes.
   On Friday, the Reagan administration gave the United Nations a
check for $85.6 million, which is a portion of the $144 million
Congress appropriated for the organization for the 1989 fiscal
year, the Times said.
   The remaining $59 million will be withheld until the
administration sees the result of the committee's work and
documentation to prove the United Nations is carrying out budgetary
and administrative changes, the paper said.
   The Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, which oversees the
U.N.'s finances, is still considering a new austerity budget
adopted by a smaller committee last month, it said.
   The Times said the withholding of the money has angered senior
United Nations officials. It said some of them suspect that
right-wing American officials are trying to keep the United Nations
short of money to make it more vulnerable to pressure.
   The United States still owes the United Nations and its
specialized agencies, such as the World Health Organization, $520
million in past debts. The White House ordered the State Department
to work out a multiyear plan for repaying the debt.

<HEAD>Protesters Demand That Priest Stay In Haiti</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Thousands of chanting youths
marched for a second day near a burned-out church to protest
reports that Roman Catholic officials ordered a radical priest out
of Haiti.
   Soldiers fired in the air to disperse some of the demonstrators
who burned tires across the road leading to the city's airport. The
youths set the fires after rumors spread that Rev. Jean Bertrand
Aristide was about to leave the country, radio stations said.
   Bishop Guire Poulard, bishop of the southern town of Jacmel,
said on the Roman Catholic Church's Radio Soleil that the rumor of
Aristide's imminent departure was unfounded.
   About 6,000 demonstrators marched for three hours Friday from
the ruins of St. Jean Bosco Church, where Aristide was pastor, to
the headquarters of the Haitian Bishops Conference in Pacot. The
same 2{-mile route was traced by about 6,000 protesters Thursday.
   The bishops conference on Sunday condemned the radical wing of
the church headed by Aristide for allegedly preaching ``violence
and class warfare.''
   The youths, enthusiastic but orderly, chanted slogans calling on
the church to change its mind and allow Aristide to remain.
   Aristide, one of the most popular figures in Haiti, was an
outspoken critic of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy's regime. Namphy was
ousted by rank-and-file soldiers in a coup Sept. 17 and replaced by
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
   On Sept. 11, Aristide was saying Mass at his St. Jean Bosco
Church when thugs attacked parishioners, killing at least 12,
wounding 70 and burning down the church. The soldiers that led the
coup cited that massacre and other state-sponsored violence as
reasons for seizing power.
   On Monday, Aristide said in a statement read on Radio Soleil
that he had received a message from Rome ordering him to leave
Haiti by Oct. 17.
   Aristide did not specify who issued the order, but Stephane
Francisque, a close friend, said the priest's Salesian Order had
told him to report to the Saint Claire parish of Montreal, Canada.
   Two previous church orders transferring Aristide to remote
parishes in Haiti were withdrawn after popular protests.
   Aristide, an advocate of liberation theology which encourages
the poor to demand social justice, has been criticized by the
Haitian Bishops Conference for allegedly preaching ``violence and
class struggle.''

<TEXT>
   The promise of Nigeria's military leaders to
restore civilian rule in 1990 is unconditional and not linked to
economic progress, says one of the African country's top government
officials.
   The transition to democracy ``is not conditioned on Nigeria's
being able to achieve economic growth ... in 1990 there will
definitely be assembly elections,'' Chief Samuel Oluyemi Falae told
reporters Friday.
   Falae, a veteran fiscal and planning official who has served
since 1986 as secretary to the military government that came to
power three years ago in a coup led by Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida
met with U.S. government and congressional leaders and officials of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund here during the past
week.
   during his visit he also flew to Houston, Texas, where a number
of expatriate Nigerians and Nigerian-Americans live and planned
other talks next week in New York before returning home.
   Falae said the message he brought from Nigeria is that Africa's
most populous country is on the way to recovery from near economic
collapse in the mid-1980s, and that it welcomes foreign investment.
   ``I am not saying Nigeria has become a paradise on earth'' for
business, but that ``individual businessmen now have a better
chance to operate,'' he said.
   The pre-1985 Nigerian government discouraged investment by
imposing long delays and requiring multiple approvals, Falae said.
A single agency of government now deals with foreign investment
proposals and is required to reply in a maximum of 30 days, he
said, adding that declaration and repatriation of dividends have
been simplified.
   Nigeria has undertaken currency devaluation, liberalization of
licensing requirements, consumer austerity and other reforms
prescribed by the World Bank and IMF, in some cases tougher than
those demanded, ``leaving us with flexibility,'' he said.
   Fourteen months after the 1985 coup, the World Bank also
signaled revived confidence in Nigeria with a loan of $452 million,
the largest ever for an African country. The bank praised the
Babangida government for ``courageous and very difficult''
austerity measures that it said justified support from the
financial community.
   After five years of decline in output, the economy is showing
signs of growth, Falae said. ``We have been sailing through a
narrow gorge, and beyond us is a wide open bay.''
   Nigeria, with a population of more than 100 million, has sharply
reduced its dependence on crude oil exports with increased sales of
non-oil manufactured products and also hopes to begin exporting
natural gas, Falae said.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Video Privacy Bill Inspired by Bork Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Video store customers would gain a right to
privacy under a Senate-passed bill inspired by newspaper accounts
of former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork's taste in home viewing.
   Customer consent would be required before stores could release
lists of the movies that they rent under the measure which cleared
the Senate on Friday.
   The House has not acted on the measure.
   The video privacy act was proposed by Sens. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Charles Grassley, R-Iowa and Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo.
   The four are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
held hearings last year on President Reagan's nomination of Bork to
the Supreme Court.
   During those hearings, a weekly newspaper in Washington, D.C.,
published a list of movies that Bork and his family had rented from
a local video store, angering Bork and members of the committee.
They felt it violated his privacy.
   Bork's nomination was defeated in the Senate on a 58-42 vote on
Oct. 23, 1987.

   Warning labels would be required on alcoholic
beverage containders under legislation approved by the Senate.
   The plan was attached to the $2.6 billion anti-drug bill the
chamber approved on Friday by an 87-3 vote.
   It would require a single warning label on all containers of
beer, wine and distilled spirits. The label would say:
   ``According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink
alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth
defects. Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to
drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., first introduced warning label
legislation 19 years ago. The final version represents a compromise
between him and Sens. John Danforth, R-Mo., and Wendell Ford, D-Ky.
   Before the legislation can be sent to President Reagan for his
signature, senators will have to work out compromise drug
legislation with members of the House, whose version of the measure
does not contain a warning label provision.

   How does Vice President George Bush rate his
debate performance against rival Michael Dukakis? ``Read my
smile,'' he suggests.
   However, the Republican presidential nominee also said he wasn't
taking anything for granted, despite recent polls showing his lead
over the Massachusetts governor to be widening.
   ``When the polls were going the other way, I said `it isn't
over.' And it wasn't. So why should I now suddenly have the luxury
of changing my position?
   ``Watch how hard we work,'' Bush told reporters traveling with
him on Air Force Two on his way back here from a campaign event in
San Diego.
   Bush today wraps up a five-day California visit with a bus tour
of state's Central Valley, with rallies planned in Stockton,
Modesto, Merced and Fresno.
   He was to spend the rest of the weekend in Denver.
   Bush aides view California as critical, and suggest that it
could go either way.
   Speaking at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography on Friday in
San Diego, Bush said if elected one of his first acts in office
would be to seek passage of stronger clean-air legislation.
   He also called for ``a very close look'' at whether proposed new
oil drilling of the coast of Southern California might harm the
environment before going ahead with federal approval for the
drilling.
   ``I oppose drilling in those environmentally sensitive areas
where the risk of damage is too great,'' he said.
   Earlier, Bush said he would oppose new drilling in Northern
California ``pending resolution of these environmental concerns.''
   Bush's suggestion that reporters ``read my smile'' was a takeoff
on his frequently used campaign speech line: ``Read my lips: no new
taxes.''
   The vice president said he did not think he would become
overconfident as a result in what was widely viewed as a good
showing in the final debate.
   Of the questions asked, Bush said: ``I thought the questions ...
were as good as any I've ever had in any of the debates ... I can't
say I welcomed them. But they were good questions.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, dined Friday night with Los Angeles
Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda. Bush called him ``an old friend.''
   Asked why he wasn't with his team plotting strategy for the
upcoming first World Series game, Lasorda cracked: ``I'm getting
all my advice from right here,'' indicating Bush.

<HEAD>Genocide Would Be Outlawed By Bill Sent to Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genocide would become a crime under U.S. law
as a result of legislation freshly approved by the Senate and sent
to President Reagan for his signature.
   The bill provides for U.S. participation in an international
treaty outlawing genocide, a pact that emerged from the ashes of
the Holocaust but went unratified by the United States until 1986.
   The United States would fulfill its treaty obligation under the
bill sent to Reagan on Friday by making genocide a crime under
domestic law.
   The action marked a triumph for retiring Sen. William Proxmire,
D-Wis., who has given more than 3,000 speeches over the past 19
years in favor of the treaty.
   Like the treaty, itself, the implementing legislation was dogged
by delays. Some Conservatives feared that the language of the pact
contained uncertaintities that could undermine the Constitution.
   But the House passed the bill on April 25, making genocide a
crime, punishable by life in prison.
   In the Senate, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a longtime critic of
the treaty, offered his support but only if the maximum penalty
were increased to death. Proxmire balked at that, saying many of
the pact's strongest partisans also were opposed to the death
penalty.
   Democratic senators said Thurmond dropped plans to offer a
capital punishment amendment in exchange for a Senate vote on a
number of President Reagan's judicial nominees. Democrats had hoped
to keep the judgeships open, giving Democrat Michael Dukakis a
chance to fill the vacancies if he won the presidential election in
November.
   Eleven judges were confirmed immediately after the Senate acted
on the genocide bill.
   Addressing the Senate, Proxmire said the treaty was made
necessary ``by the deliberate murder of 6 million Jews.''
   ``They were gassed, lined up and shot and they were worked to
death,'' Proxmire said.
   ``Why? Only because they worshiped God in a different way.''
   Proxmire won praise for his marathon persistence in urging
ratification and implementation of the treaty.
   ``I have no single doubt in my mind that there would be no
treaty without Sen. Proxmire,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr.,
D-Del.
   Biden called the Wisconsin senator ``a man of phenomenal
tenacity'' and said: ``You have never let go of a single issue in
which you believed.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., noted that the Senate's final action
to put the treaty into effect comes at the conclusion of Proxmire's
more than 30-year Senate career.
   ``There could be no greater tribute to Sen. Proxmire,'' Specter
said.
   As ratified two years ago, the treaty declares genocide an
international crime and defines it as the intentional destruction
of national, ethnic, racial or religious groups, in whole or in
part.

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, assailing his Republican rival with renewed
vigor: ``Think of where we'll be four years from now if we try to
get by on Mr. Bush's diet of old chestnuts, new baloney and the
same old voodoo stew.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, assessing his performance in Thursday's debate:
``We were specific on the issues. We came at each other pretty
hard. And when the smoke cleared it was pretty clear where we stood
and I believe that I moved my campaign forward by what happened
last night.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, with some choice words on Bush's debate-night
performance: ``Debating George Bush is just like trying to eat
Jell-O with a fork. It keeps slipping off, sliding off, and when
you finally get a bite there's not much substance to it, just a lot
of sugar water and artificial ingredients.''
   
   DAN QUAYLE, stepping up his criticism of the Massachusetts
governor: ``The political liability happens to be Governor
Dukakis.''
   
   LEE ATWATER, Bush campaign manager, tempering confidence with
cautiousness in the waning days of the campaign: ``This election is
going to be won or lost in the last three weeks. We're not going to
take anything for granted. ... If the campaign gets smug or
overconfident, we're going to be in trouble in a matter of days.
These big states are all still very close.''

<HEAD>Christians Accuse New U.S. Ambassador Of Interference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy has been
meeting regularly with members of the rival Moslem and Christian
governments, but he denied charges that he is interfering in the
internal affairs of the country.
   Since his Sept. 24 appointment, McCarthy has been meeting almost
daily with leaders of the feuding factions to settle a crisis that
has left the country without a president.
   Parliament failed to agree on a successor to President Amin
Gemayel's before his six-year term expired Sept. 22. Since then,
rival Christian and Moslem cabinets claim they govern Lebanon.
   Some Christian leaders have accused McCarthy of interfering.
   ``My government is trying to make a positive contribution in
what must be the most complex and confused period of time in the
history of Lebanon,'' McCarthy responded Friday.
   ``I regret very much if I have offended any one. That was never
my intention,'' he said.
   Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Farouk Abil-Lamaa, a Maronite
Catholic, was quoted by several Beirut newspapers Friday as saying
he considered McCarthy as only an ``American envoy and not an
accredited ambassador.''
   The independent daily An-Nahar, the conservative Al-Anwar and
the leftist As-Safir all said that Abil-Lamaa, a Christian,
apparently was angered at McCarthy's refusal to present his
credentials to the Christian government.
   The Foreign Ministry is located in Christian east Beirut and is
controlled by the Christian caretaker cabinet of army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The Aoun government is locked in a struggle for legitimacy with
the predominantly Moslem cabinet, based in west Beirut, which is
headed by Syrian-backed Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Aoun's appointment Sept. 22 _ in the last minutes of Gemayel's
term _ caused a political crisis threatening to formalize the
unofficial Christian-Moslem partition created by the outbreak of
civil war in 1975.
   McCarthy, who succeeded John Kelly, has been pressing for a
speedy election of a new president to defuse the new crisis.
   McCarthy has said he will present his credentials only to the
new president, indicating Washington's neutrality.
   Danny Chamoun, head of the National Liberal Party, also
criticized McCarthy after meeting with Abil-Lamaa Friday.
   He complained that MacCarthy had no right to visit the governor
of the central bank, Edmond Naim, at the bank in Moslem west Beirut
on Thursday.
   That meeting prompted local speculation that the United States
might be urging Naim, a Maronite Catholic, to run for president.
   Naim has pledged to keep the central bank neutral in the current
conflict between the two rival governments.
   Chamoun, a presidential aspirant and political opponent of Naim,
called the visit ``overt intervention in Lebanon's domestic
affairs.''

   The government has authorized loading of fuel
and eventual start-up of the nation's first nuclear power plant,
but environmental groups threaten to fight it with civil
disobedience.
   The approval came after government specialists testified for a
week before both houses of Congress and opponents pledged to block
roads and hold a mass sit-in.
   Assistant Energy Secretary Jose Luis Alcudia announced the
government's decision Friday to allow the Laguna Verda plant to
move forward.
   The first of two 657-megawatt reactors will be fully operational
after six months of loading fuel and operating tests, officials
said. The second reactor is to be ready by 1991.
   A joint communique of the Energy and Ecology departments Friday
night said the government ``is assuming this responsibility with
the absolute conviction that Laguna Verde is convenient for the
country and will not pose problems for the health and well-being of
the population.''
   The statement said the government had devised adequate security
and evacuation plans for the plant in case of accident. It said
these had been sanctioned by the U.S. Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations and the International Atomic Energy Organization.
   It said the electricity generated by Laguna Verde each year
would save 14 million barrels of combustible fuels.
   The plant, 200 miles east of Mexico City in Veracruz state, was
ready for the loading of radioactive fuel in December. But
President Miguel de la Madrid postponed plans after protests by
environmental groups.
   Mexico's leading ecology and anti-nuclear organizations vowed to
mount a protest rally on Sunday in Palma Sola, three miles from the
plant.
   Jose Arias Chavez, leader of the Pact of Ecological Groups, said
demonstrators would block roads and possibly attempt to occupy the
grounds of the nuclear plant. Similar demonstrations were planned
throughout the country, he said.
   He said protesters wanted to avoid ``the nuclearization of
Mexico.''

   Gunmen raked a bar with a shower of
bullets, killing a suspected underworld figure as he sipped
espresso and fatally wounding the barkeeper's wife, a new agency
reported.
   Sabato Coralluzzo, 27, was killed Friday immediately after the
two gunmen stormed the bar along a highway near Battipaglia, about
45 miles south of Naples, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   The wounded woman, 56-year-old Franca Vellecco, died several
hours later in a hospital, the agency said.
   ANSA quoted police as saying the attack appeared to be part of a
feud between rival families of the Naples underworld. There was no
report of whether the gunmen escaped.

<TEXT>
   President George Vassiliou says he is
optimistic about resuming talks next week on reuniting his country
after years of being split into Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
sectors.
   ``I wish that the peace epidemic affecting the whole world might
reach Cyprus. ... I'm hopeful an agreement can be reached,''
Vassiliou told a four-member panel of Cypriot journalists in a
television interview Friday.
   Vassiliou appeared on state-run television a day after returning
to the Mediterranean island from a 10-day trip to the United
States, Britain and France.
   ``My message was that the international climate of detente
should assist in the search for a Cyprus settlement and that the
time for this is more propitious than ever,'' he said, but added he
doesn't ``expect a settlement overnight.''
   Vassiliou and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Rauf Denktash,
resume their reunification talks next week. They have met four
times since U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar kicked
off the negotiations on Aug. 25 in Geneva.
   The U.N. chief has set a June 1989 deadline for the talks.
Vassiliou and Denktash will go to New York next month to review
progress.
   The two leaders have agreed on a bi-zonal federation for Cyprus
but differences remain over the withdrawal of about 35,000 Turkish
troops and 50,000 Turkish settlers from the northern third of the
island.
   Cyprus was partitioned in 1974 when Turkey invaded after an
Athens-inspired coup against the late President Makarios.

<TEXT>
   Islamic fundamentalists reacting to a
week of widespread riots have called for an end to emergency
regulations, a national minimum wage, civic freedoms, and more
vigorous promotion of Islam.
   Their 12-point program called for an end to a state of
emergency. The government imposed a six-day state of emergency
during the rioting, but the fundamentalists said such rules had
actually been in force since 1962, when Algeria became independent
from France.
   ``The time has come to let the people speak,'' said Ali Belhadj,
an imam at the Al Sunna mosque in the Bab-el-Oued quarter, a
fundamentalist stronghold. The religious leader read the program
before worshipers at Friday prayers.
   Riots broke out Oct. 4 in Algiers and provincial cities over
shortages, high food prices and the government's program of
austerity and economic reform. Several days of fragile calm have
followed a week of unrest.
   Belhadj was among fundamentalist leaders who organized rallies
trying to focus discontent on religious as well as economic issues.
   The fundamentalists' program stopped short of demanding an
Islamic state in Algeria, which already declares Islam the official
religion but operates in secular style with emphasis on strict
socialist policies.
   It called for an end to nepotism and feudalism in the
administration, amnesty for all political prisoners, an unspecified
guaranteed minimum wage, the unrestricted freedom to spread Islam,
and fundamental freedoms to allow people ``to manage their own
affairs.''
   The program also called for freedom of association and
expression, freedom to criticize the state, judicial reform,
amendment of legislation to eliminate ``any notion contrary to
Islam,'' reform of education to promote Islam, and freedom of the
press.
   The government has said 180 people died in the rioting, but
Algerian officials said on condition of anonymity that many more
were killed.
   Unofficial reports said 500 or more died. More than 1,000 people
were injured, according to reliable accounts from hospitals and
other sources.
   The official Algerian news agency on Friday accused French news
media of trying to provoke conflicts among Algerians, but it did
not cite examples. The Algerie Presse Service said the French press
was plotting against ``the sacred principle of Algeria's unity.''
   Most French newspapers have carried commentaries suggesting that
their government and French intellectuals have been too slow to
condemn the killings of unarmed protesters by Algerian troops.
   An Associated Press photographer, Roberto Pfeil, was detained
Friday while taking pictures of Moslem worshipers and expelled from
Algeria. The government gave no explanation.
   On Wednesday, President Chadli Bendjedid announced a ``process
of democratization,'' beginning with a national referendum Nov. 3
on making the prime minister responsible to the National Assembly.
   Details of Bendjedid's broad proposals have not become clear,
but they appear to point toward loosening the state structure built
by his predecessor, Houari Boumedienne.
   Boumedienne, who kept tight control for 13 years, died 10 years
ago, and Bendjedid was elected to replace him. Almost immediately,
he sought to weaken the system in which the ruling National
Liberation Front party kept tight rein on the nation.

<TEXT>
   A state-sponsored deer hunt for
children as young as 8 has drawn fire from animal welfare groups
and educators who claim it's too traumatic to allow kids to kill
the likes of Bambi.
   For the past four years, the state Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission has held the hunt without controversy for about 160
children, ages 8 to 15, who are accompanied by adults. Game
officials and gun advocates say the event teaches youngsters to
hunt and use firearms safely.
   But this year, opponents ranging from the animal-rights group
Fund for Animals to the Dade County School Board and PTA are
protesting the hunt, scheduled for this weekend in Camp Blanding, a
rural area south of Jacksonville.
   ``Having children kill animals for fun is ridiculous,'' said
Sharon Bailey of North Miami, who heads the Florida chapter of the
Friends of Animals, a national anti-hunting group.
   ``It twists the values of our children. I've taken 8-year-olds
to see Bambi. Even that upsets them,'' she said of the animated
Disney movie in which the young deer's mother is shot by a hunter.
   Strong protests also have come from officials in Dade County,
which includes Miami, where shooting incidents have left 37 youths
18 years old or younger dead so far this year, 13 more than in all
of 1987.
   ``I'm outraged that we could be encouraging our students to use
guns. We need to come to our senses about the use of guns,'' said
county School Superintendent Joseph Fernandez.
   At a breakfast earlier this week in Palm Beach, author and
activist Cleveland Amory confronted Gov. Bob Martinez and demanded
he cancel the hunt.
   ``Have you no shame?'' said Amory, who founded the Fund for
Animals. ``Have you no pity? It is high time for a brave governor
to know what he is doing with this.''
   But the governor ignored Amory's comments and later said the
hunt should go ahead because it fosters closer relationships
between parents and their children.
   ``This is a highly controlled deer and hog hunt,'' said game
commission spokesman Jim Huffstodt. ``There has never been an
accident. It's extremely popular. It is done to introduce youth to
hunting and wildlife.''
   In each hunt, there is a 40-deer limit.
   George Rauback, a hunter from West Dade and a National Rifle
Association member, said the youth hunt teaches children to respect
guns.
   ``I learned to hunt with my father and older brother,'' Rauback
said. ``This is a reasonable idea. It teaches hunting etiquette.
The safe handling of firearms is always worthwhile.''
   In addition to this weekend's hunt, another youth hunt is
scheduled at Camp Blanding on Oct. 29-30, and three other hunts are
planned elsewhere in the state, including one for handicapped
youngsters set for Nov. 4-6.
   State Rep. John Cosgrove, a Democrat, said it's wrong for the
state to sponsor the hunts.
   ``I hunted as a teen-ager and understand the feeling that people
have for the outdoors. However, I feel that encouraging children
under 18 to bear arms in pursuit of animal kills is not a proper
function of the state,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The United States has given a check for
$85.6 million to the United Nations, but Washington owes millions
more that the Reagan administration withheld pending U.N. austerity
measures.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters delivered the money during a
surprise visit Friday to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
The check reduced the U.S. debt to the regular budget to $366.3
million.
   A U.N. statement said the payment was the second installment of
the $188 million President Reagan promised to pay by the end of the
year. The United States earlier paid $15.2 million.
   The payment was made one day after the Soviet Union, which is
paying its own arrears, pledged the equivalent of $600 million to
U.N. relief and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.
   ``The United Nations remains financially weakened and unstable
because reserves are substantially depleted,'' said a U.N.
statement.
   ``If this situation is not corrected, it could impede the
carrying out of new peace missions,'' it said, referring to U.N
peacekeeping forces currently in the Persian Gulf and new forces
planned for southern Africa and eventually for Cambodia.
   Since Reagan took office eight years ago his administration has
harshly criticized the United Nations for what it calls
anti-Western bias, bureaucracy and waste.
   The administration withheld part of U.S. regular budget dues to
the U.N., some peacekeeping dues and other fees in order to
pressure the world body into fiscal and administrative reforms.
   Reagan recently acknowledged that the U.N. had made progress in
reforms and pledged to pay back the withheld dues by the end of
this year and the rest over several years.
   But U.S. officials said Washington will continue to withhold $59
million in dues promised this year until a key U.N. committee
approves a new austerity budget and other administrative changes,
The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   The Fifth Committee of the General Assembly, which oversees the
U.N.'s finances, is still considering a new austerity budget
adopted by a smaller committee last month, it said.

   Authorities arrested 10 alleged counterfeiters and
seized more than $39 million in phony traveler's checks after some
of the fake checks were used for cash, cocaine and shopping sprees.
   The suspects, from Israel, Finland, Colombia and Florida, were
rounded up Friday after a federal grand jury returned an indictment
charging them with conspiracy and counterfeiting.
   ``This is the largest seizure of a counterfeit traveler's check
operation in U.S. history,'' Jack Kippenberger, a U.S. Secret
Service agent, said at a news conference where he was surrounded by
stacks of seized checks and printing plates used to make them.
   The alleged ringleader was Simon Gabay, 38, an Israeli national
who ran a cosmetics distribution company and owned a print shop in
North Miami, Kippenberger said.
   ``He was the brains behind the whole operation,'' the agent
said. ``He had the plates and had the print shop where all the
money-making went on.''
   If convicted, Gabay could face up to 75 years in prison and a $5
million fine.
   Undercover Secret Service agents, who stumbled upon the
check-printing scheme as part of an investigation of currency
counterfeiting, made several purchases of checks over a four-month
period, Kippenberger said.
   While most of the checks were seized, an undetermined amount
were traded for cash and cocaine and about $40,000 in checks were
used to buy merchandise at stores along the East Coast, agents said.
   ``It imposes a severe loss, a sometimes catastrophic loss, on
those who receive them,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
``It's those in the innocent public who suffer the loss.''

   Soldiers killed four more people in the
military government's crackdown on unrest, state-run radio
reported, and officials said elections will not be held before next
year.
   The latest killings, reported Friday, lifted to more than 450
the official count of people slain by troops since a Sept. 18
military coup.
   The radio said two of the dead were looters, and the others were
shot when they ran away after troops stopped them for violating
curfew.
   The killings follow pro-democracy protests that began after Ne
Win, who seized power in a military coup 26 years ago, stepped down
in July. Two more governments fell during widespread protests, but
hardline Gen. Saw Maung seized power Sept. 18 and ordered troops to
shoot if necessary.
   He also promised general elections within about three months.
   ``All arrangements are expected to be ready by early next year,
and the date for holding of elections will be decided after
consultation with political parties,'' the chairman of the
government's election commission, Ba Htay, told representatives of
registered parties on Friday in a statement carried by Rangoon
radio.
   Eighteen parties have officially registered, but none has said
if it will participate in elections run by the government.
   The National Unity Party, which under a different name was
Burma's sole political for 26 years, is expected to have the
support of the government and military.
   The chairman said registered parties may open branches
throughout the country after consultation with ``law and order
restoration councils,'' which were set up by Saw Maung. The parties
will be allowed to carry out organizational work on their own
premises, although a ban on public meetings of more than five
people is still in force.
   The commission head said, ``The commission will try its best to
hold a free and fair general election.''

   One of two Tuscarora Indians acquitted of
charges stemming from their armed takeover of a newspaper called
the verdict ``historic,'' but the prosecutor said he feels sorry
for the hostages they took.
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, were found innocent
Friday of all charges related to the February takeover in which
they held hostages for 10 hours at the office of The Robesonian.
   The jury agreed with defense lawyers' contention that the two
men had no criminal intent when they took over the building to draw
attention to alleged official corruption, racism and drug
trafficking in Robeson County in southeastern North Carolina. The
county is one-third Indian, one-third black and one-third white.
   Hatcher and Jacobs faced charges of making and possessing
illegal firearms, conspiring to make those weapons and conveying
false information about explosives. A federal charge of
hostage-taking was dismissed earlier this week against Jacobs, but
remained against Hatcher.
   ``The jury has made what is going to be a historic verdict, a
verdict that people will remember,'' Hatcher said while leaving the
courthouse after the three-week trial. ``I don't think people
realize yet how important this verdict is.''
   One white juror, Patience Brannock, hugged Hatcher in the
hallway, saying ``God bless you. ... You're a good boy.''
   However, one of the hostages, Robesonian Editor Bob Horne, said
the verdict sent the wrong message.
   ``It seems to me the message is, if you have a grievance, to
take hostages, put them in fear for their lives and say you did it
for your own protection because you feared for your life,'' Horne
said.
   ``Does that say that Timothy Jacobs' and Eddie Hatcher's fear
counts more than the fear of the people they held hostage that
day?'' he asked. ``I saw terror that morning like I have never seen
before and hope I never see again.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Bruce, who prosecuted the case,
said the verdict was ``a failure of advocacy on my part'' and added
that he felt particularly sorry for those taken hostage.
   ``Anyone who was here in the first part of the trial to hear
their testimony knows they were in real terror. I feel that I have
let them down,'' he said.
   Hatcher and Jacobs never denied walking into The Robesonian
office Feb. 1, chaining the door shut and brandishing sawed-off
shotguns. They held as many as 20 people during the siege, in which
no one was injured.
   They surrendered after they were told the governor had agreed to
set up a task force to investigate their allegations.
   During closing arguments Thursday, defense lawyers said Hatcher
and Jacobs had not staged the takeover ``with malice.''
   That argument was ``the deciding factor in the whole case,'' one
unidentified juror told the News and Observer of Raleigh. ``I feel
it was fair based on the interpretation of the law.''
   There were no jury room arguments or heated discussions during
deliberations, said juror Sarah Thompson of Raleigh.
   ``We focused on (the no-malice argument) right there because we
had told ourselves not to let our feelings into it,'' Ms. Thompson
said.
   The panel of nine blacks and three whites took 6{ hours to
return the verdicts.
   If convicted, Hatcher could have faced life in prison and Jacobs
could have faced 40 years in prison.
   ``I'm just glad that Timothy and Eddie did something to draw
attention to the conditions in our county,'' said Eleanor Jacobs,
Jacobs' mother. ``I hate they used guns. But they did bring
attention to something that was needed. The jury had compassion.
They understood things.''
   Robeson District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt, one of the
officials Hatcher and Jacobs criticized for allegedly failing to
represent poor people in the county, said Friday he ``has begun
exploratory work'' to determine whether to pursue state charges.
   Jacobs said he was uneasy about returning to Robeson County.
   ``I'm afraid,'' Jacobs said. ``But it's my home, and where my
family is, so I am going.''
   ``I'm not afraid,'' said Hatcher, who represented himself during
the trial because his lawyer, William Kunstler, was involved in a
New York trial. ``I'm going home.''

<TEXT>
   North Korea welcomed a proposal by South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo for summit talks on reunification of the two
Koreas, but said Roh himself is not welcome in the North, an
official news report said today.
   The North's Korean Central News Agency quoted a statement Friday
by the government's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland as saying the proposal by Roh for talks ``deserves
welcome.''
   But it said that despite Roh's willingness to visit Pyongyang,
the North Korean capital, ``he has no justification to come to the
North.''
   ``Under the stringent anti-communist system of South Korea, the
South Korean leading authority himself, who is willing to come to
Pyongyang to discuss the reunification proposal, would be charged
by law and would never get off scott-free,'' the committee was
quoted as saying by the news agency, monitored in Tokyo.
   ``For the North-South top-level talks so ardently desired by the
whole nation, it is urgent to remove the legal and institutional
factors that undermine the atmosphere of national reconciliation
and trust,'' the committee said.
   South Korea's National Security Law provides penalties ranging
from five years imprisonment to death for sedition and anti-state
activity, and is used to control activities which encourage or
support North Korea.
   In a speech to the South Korean National Assembly Oct. 4, Roh
said he was willing to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Il
Sung, ``at any place and at the earliest possible date to discuss
any and all issues'' between the two Koreas.
   Roh did not disclose the details of his reunification proposals,
but said the new formula would be ``practicable and acceptable to
both sides.''
   Korea was divided at the end of World War II into the communist
North and capitalist South. They fought against each other in the
1950-53 Korean War and remain staunch enemies.

   Residents of this Pittsburgh suburb
got an unexpected wake-up call when a siren normally reserved for a
nuclear attack was accidentally activated.
   But only about 30 people out of the town's population of about
34,400 called authorities to find out what was going on, said Fire
Chief Steve Walther.
   Walther said the siren, atop the Mount Lebanon Municipal
Building, was accidentally set off shortly before 5:30 a.m. Friday.
   The siren is designed to sound the up-and-down wail to warn of
an impending nuclear attack, Walther said. In a local emergency,
the siren would sound a continuous drone.
   Walther said the siren sounded for about three minutes, as
programmed.
   ``We also learned our cancel button doesn't work,'' he said.

   For some people, being little can mean
big problems.
   For Ed Lang, dealing with supermarket shelves, high curbs and
some water fountains can be difficult. Lang, a 40-year-old former
journalist who works as a technical writer for IBM, is 4 feet 2
inches tall.
   He and about 80 other little people from Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi and Alabama are in town for a three-day regional
conference of the Little People of America.
   Little People. Not midgets.
   ``We abhor that word, `midget,' '' Lang said. ``When people hear
it, they think of a circus, and that keeps them from seeing us as
serious or professional.''
   Actor Billy Barty founded the organization in 1957. About 5,000
of the nearly 1 million Americans under 4 feet 10 inches are
members.
   This weekend, the group will dine, dance and listen to
physicians from Miami Children's Hospital discuss new advances in
the field of dwarfism. They will also seek to remind those around
them that they, too, are regular folks.

<HEAD>Jews Recall Life In Shanghai 50 Years After Exodus</HEAD>

   Fifty years after the first Jews fled Nazi
Europe for Shanghai, the refugees from around the world gathered to
recall nights in crowded warehouses and life in the steamy port
that was their haven.
   ``It's been an electrifying experience. I've met so many people
I haven't seen in all these years,'' said Norman Shelton, 61, who
left Berlin for Shanghai in April 1939 and now lives in Orlando,
Fla.
   Shelton was among about 18,000 Jewish refugees who fled Germany,
Austria and Poland for Shanghai in 1938 and 1939. The Chinese port
was then the only place in the world where escaping Jews could
settle without visas.
   Most remained there until 1948.
   About 150 of the group, who call themselves the
``Shanghai-landers,'' gathered this week for a four-day reunion
that ended Friday. It was held in Israel to coincide with the
country's 40th anniversary celebrations.
   Reunions also were held in 1980 in Los Angeles and in 1985 in
New York, but many of those who came to Israel missed the earlier
gatherings. They sang Japanese nursery rhymes, traded yellowed
photographs of soccer games played in the teeming Shanghai streets,
and renewed friendships.
   ``You can't believe the excitement. I met someone here that I
slept alongside for four years in the same dormitory and haven't
seen since,'' said Frankfurt-born Manfred Konig of New York.
   Some of their more famous comrades, including artist Peter Max
and ex-Treasury Secretary Michael Blumenthal, were absent.
   The journey to China from Europe was a perilous odyssey that
took a month, often through Siberia by rail and then by freighter
ship to Shanghai.
   The refugees left with just 10 marks, about $4, in their pockets
and carried Nazi-issued passports stamped with a large red ``J''
for Jew and the words ``For Exit Only.''
   The two-year exodus to Shanghai began after the ``crystal
night,'' Nov. 9, 1938, when Nazi-led rioters attacked Jewish homes
and businesses in Germany and Austria and set dozens of synagogues
ablaze.
   The attack marked the start of Adolf Hitler's slaughter of 6
million Jews.
   Shelton's father was among the 30,000 Jews arrested and sent to
concentration camps at Dachau and Buchenwald on crystal night.
   ``We soon discovered the only way to get my dad out was to go to
the Nazis with a one-way ticket out of Germany,'' Shelton said.
``My mother was frantic. She ran into the street, and people told
her about Shanghai. We got the money together, and we were gone in
three weeks.''
   Shelton described his father's shock as the family prepared to
flee. ``The first thing my dad did after getting out of that
concentration camp was to pull out his World War I decorations and
throw them into the toilet bowl.''
   Curt Pollack, whose family fled Berlin in January 1939, recalled
the rampant disease and malnutrition that awaited the refugees in
subtropical Shanghai and left about 2,000 dead.
   ``These men were released from concentration camps straight onto
the boat. After 28 arduous days, they arrived in the stifling heat
of Shanghai. My father had dysentery within a week. People were
dying right and left,'' he said.
   German-born Claude Spingarn was nine years old when his family
arrived at Shanghai in March 1939.
   ``We were piled into this pickup truck and taken to a warehouse
where about 100 people were sleeping in bedrolls on the floor.
Rations were served from a soup kitchen. My mother was in shock,''
said Spingarn of Rochester, N.Y.
   When the Pacific war broke out in 1942, the Shanghai Jews were
confined by the occupying Japanese to a 3-square-mile ghetto in a
warehouse district. Jobs were scarce and hunger widespread, but
Pollack said the hardships forged a special closeness.
   ``We formed a permanent bond. I was born in Germany and I live
in Los Angeles, but my most vivid memories are of Shanghai,'' he
said.
   Pollack, like many other Shanghai Jews, has since returned to
the teeming Chinese port, in 1980 and 1984.
   ``I had the desire to go back and see the old neighborhood
again,'' he said. ``Some people go back to Brooklyn to see if the
old deli is still there. For me, Shanghai is the closest thing I
can come to reminiscing and going back.''

   The government ordered a major Chinese
corporation linked to official corruption to consolidate and sever
ties with a welfare fund headed by the son of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, an official report said today.
   The state-run investment and development firm, Kang Hua
Development Corp., is reported to be a main target of a government
campaign against the pervasive problem of official corruption. The
corporation says it controls about 200 companies nationwide.
   The People's Daily newspaper said Deng singled out the company
for criticism. It said he ordered it to cut ties with the China
Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, which is run by his disabled son,
Deng Pufang.
   Unconfirmed reports in the Hong Kong press have said Kang Hua
officials used links to the welfare fund to obtain tax privileges
and extra import permits. Reports have charged that the company has
profiteered in imports and other hard-to-get materials.

<HEAD>Illness That Affected Hundreds Linked To Airline Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Northwest Airlines passengers
have been stricken with an illness that may be linked to
contaminated food served on several flights, a malady so
distressing that some victims said they ``thought they were going
to die.''
   ``We have cases all over the country,'' said Michael Osterholm,
the state epidemiologist. The Minnesota Health Department received
hundreds of calls Thursday and Friday, he said.
   Five of the reports, which came to light after members of the
Minnesota Vikings football team were sickened, were confirmed as
cases of the bacterial illness shigellosis, an intestinal infection
that causes severe diarrhea, gripping abdominal pain and other
symptoms that can last for five to seven days.
   ``The one common phrase being reported (to investigators) is
people thinking they have never been so sick, that they thought
they were going to die,'' Osterholm said.
   He said he expects additional cases to be confirmed in the next
few weeks.
   ``It would not surprise me if there eventually were hundreds of
confirmed cases, but right now any number (estimate) would be
premature,'' he said.
   Those who were confirmed with the illness took Northwest flights
that originated in Minneapolis-St. Paul and went to Nashville,
Tenn., Detroit, Seattle and Newark, N.J., Osterholm said. The
malady was reported among members of the Minnesota Vikings after
they took a charter flight to Miami.
   The flights occurred between Sept. 25 and Oct. 4. Osterholm said
illnesses that could be shigellosis were reported by people who
were on about 30 flights, the latest of which was Oct. 8.
   ``We have no reason to believe it is happening now,'' he said.
   The confirmed illnesses have been traced to food prepared in
Marriott Corp.'s airline kitchen at the Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport. The facility prepares 100,000 meals a week
for Northwest.
   The outbreak came to light after 21 players and staff of the
Vikings became acutely ill two to five days after their game in
Miami Oct. 2. Osterholm said Thursday that after the game, the
Vikings, some of their family members and two Miami locker room
workers ate Marriott sandwiches that were brought from Minneapolis.
   In addition to contracting the disease from contaminated food,
the illness spreads easily from person to person.
   Two members of the Vikings, Brad Edwards and Tim Irwin, were
hospitalized after eating the sandwiches, the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch reported. Irwin, a 280-pound tackle, lost 9 pounds.
There were no other reports of hospitalizations in the United
States.
   Alan Munchaster, vice president of corporate relations for
Northwest, said preliminary tests on Marriott employees who may
have handled the food were negative. Marriott is conducting further
tests to pinpoint the source of the bacteria, Munchaster said.
   ``They're looking at cold food and the lettuce,'' Munchaster
said. ``Those seem to be the culprits.''
   Munchaster said Marriott is testing its outgoing food as an
additional precaution.

<HEAD>Dukakis Jokes At Jackson Birthday Party; Woos Hispanic Vote</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: First event scheduled for 10:30 a.m. EDT; lede planned</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis early today attended a
birthday tribute to Jesse Jackson, saluting his former rival's work
on behalf of the Democratic Party while joking about a flap that
jeopardized their relationship.
   The Democratic presidential nominee also trumpeted his candidacy
at the Los Angeles gathering and was given a glowing endorsement by
Jackson.
   Dukakis was picking up the endorsement of a Hispanic police
group today in Los Angeles before flying on to San Antonio, Texas
and then home to Boston.
   The Jackson event came at the end of a marathon campaign day for
Dukakis, who appeared with Jackson on Friday morning in Los
Angeles, hours later with running mate Lloyd Bentsen in Sacramento,
at an early evening rally in Seattle and a meeting of a Hispanic
organization back in Los Angeles just before attending the Jackson
party.
   At each of the stops he raised an issue that came up during his
final debate with Republican nominee George Bush on Thursday _ the
appointments the next president will get to make to the Supreme
Court.
   Dukakis told the crowds that Bush would appoint people like
Robert Bork, an appointee of President Reagan who was rejected by
the Senate, while he would appoint justices dedicated to civil and
voters' rights.
   Joint appearances between Dukakis and Jackson have been rare
since the Democratic National Convention and Dukakis, attempting a
series of jokes during his address at the birthday party, created
an awkward moment when he joked that he had not known about the
party until told by reporters.
   ``Don't you think he'd have called me,'' Dukakis said, his joke
met by polite but nervous laughter.
   When Dukakis selected Bentsen, he was unable to reach Jackson
and the former candidate was told of the selection by reporters,
sparking a temporary rift between the two.
   Dukakis also turned questions about his personality into jokes
about the exuberant Jackson.
   ``Jesse, you've got to smile more,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got
to make him a little more likeable, don't you think?''
   Dukakis came bearing gifts, giving Jackson a video cassette
recorder, a Dukakis-Bentsen hat and a Dukakis campaign jacket.
   In return, Jackson delivered an impassioned endorsement of his
former rival.
   ``The governor set the pace, established the principles,
articulated the policies, set forth the priorities,'' Jackson said.
``Now we the people must make the investment.''
   Jackson said that a Bush administration would threaten civil
rights gains and declared:
   ``Governor Dukakis can be trusted to keep hope alive and build
the America that must be, the America of our dreams.''
   Earlier, at the Hispanic event, Dukakis continued his
post-debate attempt to paint Bush as a failed leader who
demonstrated his lack of judgment in selecting Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle as his running mate and by saying during the debate that
Bork would have been an ``outstanding'' justice.
   He mockingly referred to Bush's pledge to put Quayle in charge
of the war on drugs.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, we can't take four years of that _ we
can't take four days of that,'' Dukakis said.
   He also defended himself against Bush charges that Dukakis is
soft on crime, referring to crimes committed against his father and
brother and the decline in major crimes during his tenure as
Massachusetts governor.
   ``I just didn't decide to care in an election year,'' Dukakis
said.

<HEAD>Man Awarded $1.2 Million After Vocal Chords Crushed In Police
Choke-Hold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A District of Columbia man whose vocal chords
were crushed by a police choke-hold after he got into a dispute
with officers at the scene of a traffic accident has been awarded
$1.2 million.
   A Superior Court jury on Friday granted the award to Townsend W.
Janey.
   Janey, 51, had come to the scene of a May 1985 accident
involving his son, Derek, and berated police for taking too long to
arrive when an officer put him in a choke-hold.
   ``I was moving my hand back and forth, trying to get some air in
there, and I felt I was passing out but I don't ever remember
hitting the ground,'' he recalled on Friday.
   Janey was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, but the
case was thrown out by a D.C. judge a month later, and three
investigations by the city found that the arrest was groundless and
excessive force had been used.
   Two officers were disciplined in connection with the incident,
but city officials said the award was excessive and would be
appealed.

<HEAD>Marines Return Super Stallion Copters to Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps' fleet of CH-53E Super
Stallion helicopters is back in operation after being suspended
following a one-time inspection prompted by the discovery of a
defective nut.
   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a Marine spokesman in Washington, said
Friday all 93 of the Super Stallions were returned to service after
emergency inspections failed to turn up any other defective nuts.
   The heavy-lift transport copters, almost all of which are based
inside the United States, were temporarily grounded last Sunday
after mechanics at a training squadron at the Tustin, Calif.,
Marine Corps Air Station found a scratch on a main transmission
gearbox nut.
   The Naval Air Systems Command has concluded, however, that some
of the ``transmission barrel nut assemblies'' purchased by the
Defense Logistics Agency for the Super Stallions are defective and
they are being removed from the inventory, Peck added.

   President Reagan, borrowing a phrase from Vice
President George Bush says the five Discovery shuttle astronauts
are ``America's heroes.''
   ``Thank you for taking us into space ... and welcome home,''
Reagan said, evoking a round of applause from the crowd which
included many NASA employees and some of their family members
attending the Rose Garden ceremony.
   ``The vice president was right last night _ you are America's
heroes. You are his heroes and mine ... what you have done for the
program and the country will be long remembered,'' Reagan told the
five-member crew, referring to a statement made by Bush during the
presidential debate with Michael Dukakis.
   The Discovery flight, which began on Sept. 29, was the first
shuttle mission since the Challenger blew up on liftoff, killing
all seven aboard.

Middle District of North Carolina; Charles R. Butler Jr., Mobile,
Ala., for the Southern District of Alabama; and Lewis T. Babcok,
Boulder, Colo., for the District of Colorado.
   In addition, others approved were Robert Leon Jordon, Johnston
City, Tenn., for the Eastern District of Tennessee; D. Brooks
Smith, Altoona, Pa., for the Western District of Pennsylvania; and
Jay C. Waldman, Philadelphia, for the Eastern District of

<HEAD>EPA Decides Not To Decide For Now On Acid Rain Request</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
has decided to postpone a decision on a petition asking it to
determine that U.S. pollution forms acid rain hurting Canada.
   The petition was filed in April by the six New England states,
New York, New Jersey, Minnesota and four environmental groups. In
addition, the Canadian province of Ontario filed a separate
petition.
   Don Clay, EPA's acting assistant administrator for air
pollution, on Friday wrote the states and environmental groups
saying, ``It would be premature to rule on your petition at this
time,'' the agency announced.
   A similar letter was sent to Ontario.
   The issue of sulfur dioxide emissions originating in the United
States and forming acid rain that is killing aquatic life in lakes
in sensitive watersheds of the Northeast, the Upper Midwest and in
eastern Canada was first raised in the last days of the Carter
administration in 1981.
   During the Reagan administration the states, environmental
groups and Canada revived the issue arguing that the United States
has an obligation under the Clean Air Act for EPA to force states
to rewrite their air pollution control plans to reduce the
emissions harming Canada.

   For a while it looked like Chicken Boy, who
had been perched atop a fast-food restaurant for 16 years, wouldn't
get any respect.
   The 22-foot-tall, 500 pound half-man, half-chicken statue was
rejected by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the
Museum of Modern Mythology in San Francisco and even the
Smithsonian Institution.
   But graphics designer Amy Inouye decided to save the Los Angeles
landmark from oblivion. She bought the fiberglass statue from the
eatery for $1,500 in 1985, and would not let rejection ruffle her
feathers.
   She decided to turn Chicken Boy into a golden goose.
   Last year, she created the ``Chicken Boy Catalog for a Perfect
World,'' filled with a line of gifts inspired by the statue, which
has the head of a cartoon hen and the body of a muscle man holding
a yellow bucket of chicken.
   ``Chicken Boy always really meant something to me,'' said Ms.
Inouye. ``He kind of symbolizes Los Angeles. I think he's odd and
goofy, and also kind of serene, which is something I admire.''
   The catalog offers T-shirts, postcards, mugs, watches, ball
point pens _ even boxer shorts _ all bearing Chicken Boy's
likeness. Many items include his motto, ``Too Tall to Live, Too
Weird to Die.''
   The catalog also features such novelties as Goodyear Tire
ashtrays, Lava Lites, and Ms. Inouye's own creation, ``computer
cozies,'' computer covers that come in Hawaiian or leopard prints.
   Chicken Boy so far hasn't generated the kind of consumer
interest of Garfield or the Smurfs, but Ms. Inouye says she has
sold about 2,000 T-shirts and has managed to turn a small profit.
   ``There really hasn't been a plan behind all this. I look at it
more as a learning experience,'' she said.

   Flames leaped up to 10 feet in the air and
smoke filled the pressroom of the San Diego Union & Tribune
building early today when a fire broke out in one of four presses
printing The San Diego Union.
   Approximately 150 to 200 people evacuated the building after the
fire broke out at 1:15 a.m. No one was injured, and the blaze was
extinguished within minutes by the newspaper's fire sprinkler
system. Employees were allowed to return a little more than an hour
later.
   There was no structural damage to the building, but smoke and
water damage was extensive, said Battalion Chief Russell Loughy of
the San Diego Fire Department. It wasn't immediately known how
badly the press was damaged, he said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Workers putting out an early edition of the morning Union were
alerted to the fire when a loud alarm went off.
   ``And then we saw smoke fill the entire pressroom,'' said John
Barksdale, a plate maker. ``There were flames on the press and
paper.''

   A man who claims to be the sailor
kissing a nurse in a famous Life magazine photograph taken at the
end of World War II has settled a lawsuit against Time Inc., but
the sailor's identity remains a mystery.
   The photograph by Alfred Eisenstaedt, which appeared in the Aug.
27, 1945, issue of Life, shows a sailor and a nurse kissing
passionately in New York City's Times Square to celebrate Japan's
surrender to the United States.
   The settlement approved here Friday by U.S. District Judge
Ronald R. Lagueux does not state if George Mendonsa, the
64-year-old Middletown fisherman who claimed to be the sailor,
truly is.
   There was no exchange of money, and Mendonsa agreed to
acknowledge that Time possesses a valid copyright and may use the
photograph as it likes.
   Mendonsa, who filed the suit in June 1987, had sought $100,000
compensation, claiming the magazine was profiting by selling copies
of the photograph for $1,600.
   ``Time Inc. was never able to identify the sailor,'' said Laury
Frieber, a New York-based attorney for the owner of Life. ``We did
not, as the result of the settlement, make any representation as to
who the sailor is. We consider the result a victory.''
   Patrick Hayes Sr., Mendonsa's attorney, said Friday he and his
client are ``85 percent satisfied. We never did expect any money
damages.''
   Hayes said his client merely wanted to submit for the record a
report by Richard M.A. Benson, a photography expert and instructor
at Yale University that Mendonsa hired to examine the photograph.
   The report stated Mendonsa and the sailor shared several
physical traits, including ``an unusual bump'' on the inside of the
left arm, indicating with ``a reasonable degree of certainty'' that
Mendonsa was the man in the photograph.
   ``I know it sounds kind of funny,'' Mendonsa has said of his
claim, ``but people like me don't often do something famous,
regardless of how insignificant it seemed at the time. I owe it, in
part, to the men I served with.''
   At least 23 men have told Time they are the sailor in the
photograph, Lagueux wrote in his consent judgement.
   Time asserted in the agreement that even if the sailor was
Mendonsa, the magazine was entitled to use the picture under the
First Amendment of the Constitution.
   ``Imagine the consequences if anytime a recognizable figure
could not be sold without the involvement of the subject or its
descendants,'' said Harry Johnston, vice president and general
counsel for Time's magazine division.

   The ban was made in response to a request from several religious

<HEAD>House Bulldozed After Experts Couldn't Explain Strange Phenomena</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLAND HILLS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A real-life version of ``The
Amityville Horror'' forced authorities to bulldoze a house in this
Chicago suburb after flames mysteriously shot from an electrical
socket and smoky mists filled the air.
   ``Maybe it's ghosts, I don't know,'' insurance adjuster Joe
Skubisz said Friday, laughing and quickly noting he doesn't believe
in such things.
   ``There's no truth to the rumor there was any type of haunted
situation there. It was strictly some type of escaping gas. But the
fire department wouldn't allow the policyholder to live in the
house, so we had to pay out on the claim,'' said Skubisz, associate
manager of a Travelers Insurance Co. claim office.
   While Skubisz believes there is some logical explanation for the
phenomena, arson investigators Steve Smith and Terry Hyland of the
Orland Fire District say engineers, chemists, geologists,
scientists and experts in explosives ran every conceivable test and
couldn't come up with an answer.
   They ruled out arson, natural gas, methane gas, sewer gas, other
vapors or electricity.
   ``We have no logical explanation now, but maybe 50 years from
now someone will come up with an answer,'' Hyland said. ``Right
now, we just don't know.
   ``The house was subjected to every kind of test. It was
demolished because there was nothing left to test for. The only
experiment left was to let someone live in that house,'' he said.
   Fire officials recorded 26 separate reports of strange
happenings from March to August.
   Travelers, which had insured the house, finally concluded it
wasn't safe to live in. So on Thursday, the 9-year-old home south
of Chicago was bulldozed into a pile of rubble.
   One of the most frightening incidents happened in April, when a
flame one inch in diameter roared out of a wall socket in an
upstairs bedroom and shot 21 inches into a mattress, Smith said.
   The flame was witnessed by an Orland Hills police officer, an
electrician who was a part-time officer in another community and
two consulting engineers hired to investigate the mystery, Smith
said.
   ``The fire was under pressure, and that kind of pressure can't
build up in electrical conduit because it's open throughout the
entire house,'' he said.
   At other times, dense smoky mists or a strong smell of sulfur
permeated the house, the investigators said.
   After the first few incidents, fire authorities advised the
family who lived there not to sleep in the home at night. When the
bizarre events continued, authorities told the family to move out
and Travelers hired an engineering company to investigate.

   A grand jury indicted a white teen-ager
on second-degree murder charges in connection with the shooting of
a black man whose death triggered rioting in a mostly black
neighborhood last month.
   Tamala ``Tami'' Vergo, 17, of Greenwood faces a maximum penalty
of life in prison if convicted in the killing of William McKinney,
22. She was indicted Thursday.
   Police said the Sept. 20 shooting stemmed from a drug deal that
went sour, but that McKinney was only a bystander.
   Officials have blamed the rioting in the Cedar Grove
neighborhood on a buildup of racial tension in the black community
from several factors, including unemployment.
   Cynthia Johnson, who was not indicted in the case, told police
she drove Ms. Vergo to a convenience store parking lot to buy
``crack'' cocaine.
   Police said there was a confrontation at the site, and Ms. Vergo
allegedly fired two indiscriminate shots toward a group of people
nearby. One bullet struck McKinney, who was not involved in the
dispute.
   Defense attorney Maurice Loridans has indicated his defense of
Ms. Vergo will include self-protection.

   Fishermen protesting chemical pollution
agreed today to accept more than $20 million to end a sit-in that
halted work at 18 factories in a major petrochemical complex, a
government official said.
   About 2,000 fishermen stormed the Linyuan Industrial Park, about
220 miles south of Taipei, on Wednesday. They claim polluted
wastewater from the factories has poisoned fish and shrimp in their
fishing grounds.
   They originally demanded a total of $26.3 million, or about
$3,500 for each of the 7,500 members of their nearby village,
Sanwei.
   However, Yang Shih-chien, head of the Industrial Development
Bureau, said the fishermen instead agreed to a total of $20.7
million, or about $2,800 for each resident. The government and
factories will share the cost.
   The official told reporters that operation of the complex would
resume soon, possibly by Sunday or Monday.
   Government officials will continue to negotiate with residents
in other villages affected by the pollution, he said.
   Meanwhile, Economics Minister Chen Li-an told legislators his
ministry would tighten pollution controls at the complex within
three years.
   The affected companies include two that account for about 60
percent of the ethylene, propylene and other chemical materials
supplied to Taiwan's export-oriented textile and plastic industries.

<TEXT>
   In a court filing, prosecutors say a
23-year-old former firefighter admitted setting about 17 of the
more than 20 arson fires that have terrorized the town of Jefferson
and nearby areas for six months.
   Prosecutors made the claim in an effort to persuade Coos County
Superior Court Judge Harold Perkins II on Friday to detain Lance
Lalumiere in jail without bail. Lalumiere is being held in lieu of
$50,000 cash bail.
   Perkins continued Lalumiere's bail hearing until Tuesday. He
also delayed action on a similar request by prosecutors to revoke
$50,000 cash bail for Lawrence Coulter Jr., 19, of Jefferson,
another volunteer firefighter who also is charged in the case.
   Though prosecutors said Lalumiere admitted setting the fires,
they said they don't want to release the statements or other
evidence until after the evidence is presented to a grand jury.
   That sparked objections by Lalumiere's lawyer, Philip Waystack,
who demanded copies of the documents. Waystack told Perkins it is
unfair for the state to cite the evidence but refuse to disclose it.
   ``The state cannot have it both ways,'' he said. ``It can't make
use of alleged evidence to detain this man, then hold that
evidence.''
   ``We all must keep in focus (that) Mr. Lalumiere has certain
constitutional protections. One of them is the presumption of
innocence,'' he added.
   County Attorney Pierre Morin and Assistant Attorney General
Andrew Serell argued in their motion that Lalumiere should be
detained due to ``the nature and number of these offenses.'' They
also argued that the dishwasher ``poses a serious risk to the
safety of the community.''
   On Wednesday, state police charged Lalumiere, of Jefferson, with
setting one fire and said they plan to seek indictments charging
him with 15 others.
   The motion by Morin and Serell said that in addition to the Aug.
23 fire Lalumiere is formally charged with setting, ``defendant has
given statements admitting to committing some 16 other acts of
arson in the Jefferson, N.H., area.''
   Jefferson, population 850, has had 21 suspicious fires since
May. Nearby towns have had at least three others, including one
Oct. 3 in Dalton for which Coulter was charged Thursday.
   Perkins scheduled hearings Monday for each defendant on the
defense requests for evidence.
   Neither man entered a plea at his arraignment, which is
customary in felony arraignments in district courts.

   Southern California is well known for its
fitness-oriented culture, but reporters who came to cover this
week's presidential debate were greeted by one bit of hospitality
that did not quite fit in with the health-conscious stereotype.
   In the UCLA ballroom where a press working area was set up,
media representatives were treated to all the free cigarettes they
could smoke.
   The tables piled with cigarette packs came courtesy of the
Philip Morris company _ as did the full buffet of cold cuts, hot
dishes, salads and desserts.
   It wasn't the first time those covering the debates were treated
by the cigarette manufacturer.
   The traveling press hospitality center has followed the
election-year debate schedule from the heart of tobacco land in
Winston-Salem, N.C., where the first Michael Dukakis-George Bush
debate was held, to Omaha, Neb., for last week's vice presidential
debate, and on to Los Angeles for the last presidential showdown.
   And there was a specific reason for the omnipresence of Philip
Morris, even though some non-smoking members of the media
complained that the dispensing of free cigarettes only encouraged
puffing by smokers who have learned to curtail their habit aboard
campaign planes.
   Philip Morris was one of the three top financial backers of the
trio of debates, said Janet Brown, director of the bipartisan
Commission on Presidential Debates that hosted the events.
   She did not disclose the amount of Philip Morris' contribution,
but said it was in the six-figure range. The cost of putting on
each debate was estimated at some $500,000, which had to be raised
by the commission from corporate, private and other sources.
   It was Philip Morris' request to contribute to the debate by
fully outfitting the press center at each one, she said.
   As for the cigarettes, ``They simply said they'd like to put out
a range of their products including cigarettes.`
   Other Philip Morris-owned products on hand included Jell-O
pudding, in addition to free pens, notebooks and ashtrays.
   Philip Morris is also a major contributor to the Democratic
Party, giving the Democratic National Committee at least $100,000
this year.

<TEXT>
   Angus McDermid, one of the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s most distinguished radio foreign correspondents who worked
in Africa, Washington and Europe, has died, his family announced
today. He was 67.
   He died at his home in north Wales on Thursday, the family said.
No cause of death was given.
   McDermid's reports were a staple of BBC radio news bulletins for
more than 20 years. Among the many events he covered were the
Nigerian civil war in the 1960s and the Watergate scandal in the
United States in the 1970s.
   Always versatile, he sidestepped Nigerian censors in the civil
war by dictating his exclusive story on the assassination of an
army general in the Welsh to his wife in London.
   McDermid started his career as a part-time reporter on a small
newspaper in north Wales in 1939 and rejoined the paper after
service with the Royal Air Force during World War II.
   He joined the BBC in 1957 and in 1963 became its central African
correspondent, based in what was then Rhodesia.
   In 1964, he was appointed the BBC's west Africa correspondent.
In 1969, his beat was central and east Africa and shortly after he
became the BBC's South Africa correspondent based in Johannesburg.
   He was appointed the BBC's Washington correspondent in 1972 and
returned to Europe five years later to become its correspondent in
Brussels, headquarters of the European Economic Community.
   He was appointed diplomatic and court correspondent in 1979 and
although he officially retired in 1980 he was a regular BBC radio
presenter until 1987.
   Queen Elizabeth II honored him in 1980 by making him an officer
of the Order of the British Empire.
   He is survived by his wife and their daughter.

<TEXT>
   A former Fire Department paramedic was
sentenced to a year in jail for refusing to aid a disabled
alcoholic who died, partly from lack of treatment.
   Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith told retired paramedic Robert
Dougherty, 50, on Friday that he had an arrogant attitude at work
that contributed to the death of 42-year-old Melvin Wagner.
   The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Brian Kelberg, said
Dougherty ``had a long history of deciding outside the scope of his
responsibilities who should or shouldn't get care.''
   Dougherty, a 20-year department veteran, also was sentenced to
three years' probation for admitting to submitting false
information on a report about the handling of Wagner.
   Dougherty, who retired in 1987, pleaded guilty in July to gross
negligence in Wagner's death on Sept. 23, 1985.
   Dougherty refused to heed Wagner's pleas to be taken to a
hospital after Wagner said he had been ill for four months, the
paramedic's partner, James Mihalka, testified. Dougherty termed the
case a transportation problem and left without taking the vital
signs of the partially paralyzed man.
   On a second call to Wagner's residential hotel, Dougherty
refused to enter Wagner's room, even though a social worker said
the man was gasping for breath, Mihalka said.
   Wagner died a little more than an hour after the paramedics'
second visit. A coroner determined that Wagner died of internal
hemorrhaging.

   A staff member at a Christian center was
charged with killing the 8-year-old daughter of the center's fiery
leader, and 53 other children who may have been abused were taken
into custody, authorities said.
   Dayna Lorea Broussard, 8, had been beaten and whipped to death,
Dr. Larry Lewman, Oregon's medical examiner, said Friday.
   The girl apparently lived at one of two homes outside Portland
occupied by children and others affiliated with the Los
Angeles-based Watts Christian Center. Her father, Eldridge
Broussard Jr., is pastor at the center.
   A staff member at the center, Willie K. Chambers, was charged
with murder. Chambers, 35, also is the father of a student at the
center.
   Carolyn Van Brunt, dean of the school and training programs at
Watts Christian Center, said the group sometimes used ``physical
correction'' as a form of discipline. Speaking Friday night from
Los Angeles, she denied the punishment was cruel, but said she had
never seen it administered.
   ``These kids are from (the Los Angeles ghetto) Watts and they
have to deal with gangs and drugs and people with no discipline,''
she said.
   Chambers and three other adults brought the girl's body to a
fire station in a rural area southeast of Portland early Friday.
The other three were charged with hindering prosecution.
   Clackamas County sheriff's Capt. Pat Detloff said deputies then
went to one of the center's homes about eight miles east of Sandy
and 25 miles east of Portland.
   There, they found three adults supervising 29 boys and 24 girls,
ranging in age between 3 months and 16 years, Detloff said.
   There was little furniture in the house and the children
appeared to be sleeping on pillows on the floor, he said.
Investigators were unsure how long the children had been at the
home, he added.
   Authorities ``noticed some of the kids appeared to have old
injuries that would be suspected as physical abuse,'' Detloff said.
The three adult supervisors were not charged, he added.
   Most of the children were taken by bus Friday night to juvenile
shelters in Woodburn and Salem, while others were placed
temporarily in foster homes, said Alice Galloway of the state
Children's Services Division.
   Galloway said physical examinations and interviews were planned
over the weekend for the children, all of whom are from Los Angeles.
   ``We hope to have them back with their parents as soon as
possible,'' she said.

<HEAD>Two Leading Political Parties Agree On Constitutional Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's Liberal and Conservative
parties have agreed to reform the country's constitution, and a
court system that will not let drug traffickers go unpunished
appears to be one of the goals.
   Other proposed changes would allow the bicarmel legislature to
force Cabinet ministers to resign and allow presidential primary
elections.
   The amended constitution also would end 28 years of each
president being required to name some Cabinet ministers from the
opposition party.
   The agreement, disclosed Friday by Colombia's minister of
government, Cesar Gaviria, ended two years of bitter feuding
between the two parties on what changes there should be in the
constitution.
   President Virgilio Barco of the Liberal Party met for eight
hours with former president Julio Cesar Turbay, director of the
Liberal Party, and former president Misael Pastrana, chief of the
Conservative party, Gaviria said.
   The Colombian Congress will be asked to approve the
constitutional reforms before it goes into recess Dec. 17, Gaviria
said at a news conference. The Liberal and Conservative parties
make up 95 percent of Colombia's congress.
   A bipartisan congressional committee appointed earlier this year
to study possible reforms decided that Colombia's court system
should be patterned in some ways after the U.S. court system.
   The current 19th-centry court system in Colombia has judges
investigating cases, taking depositions, hearing out of court
testimony and deciding on their own if a suspect should be charged
or set free.
   It is common knowledge that some judges are bribed. No major
drug trafficker has ever been convicted of drug trafficking and
spent more than a few weeks in jail.
   Currently federal prosecutors play a very small role in
Colombia. Criminal charges are made by individuals, and a chief
judge assigns investigations to other judges. Under the new system,
a federal prosecutor would decide who would be charged and would
take over the investigatory duties.
   The constitutional reform committee also envisions the naming of
a special prosecutor to be in charge of human rights cases.
   Death squads have killed more than 800 people in the last two
years. Each of those cases is investigated by a different judge,
denying the possibility of a major federal investigation linking
any of the cases.
   There have been only 12 convictions in death squad cases.
   The minister of government said Friday that the constitutional
reforms would allow Colombia's Congress to force a Cabinet minister
to resign.
   Currently Colombia's congress has little power. Constitutional
reform would allow the congress to censure a Cabinet minister on a
vote of confidence.
   Another major change in Colombian politics would be the end of
Colombia's National Front, a sharing of power between the Liberal
and Conservative parties. The National Front was created 28 years
ago to end a war between the Liberal and Conservative parties, a
war that took more than 250,000 lives.
   The two parties had decided then to alternate the presidency
every four years, with no president being able to succeed himself.
   The National Front agreement also requires each president to
name some Cabinet ministers from the opposition party. The number
appointed depends upon the percentage of votes the opposition
received in the presidential election. The Conservative Party
withdrew from the Front after Barco was elected in 1986. The two
party leaders also agreed the constitition should allow each party
to decide before each presidential election if there should be a
primary election, Gaviria said.
   Under the bill to be presented to congress, future changes in
the constitution could be proposed by the president and put to a
national vote, the minister of government said. Now only the
congress can amend the constitution.

<HEAD>Mrs. Mandela Visits Husband, Says He Is Angered By Botha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnie Mandela visited her
husband, black nationalist Nelson Mandela, at his tightly guarded
hospital room today and said he was angry at suggestions he was
cooperating with the government.
   President P.W. Botha, while in Switzerland last week, suggested
the jailed African National Congress leader could be freed if he
``continues cooperating with the authorities, as he is doing at
present.''
   ``About the so-called cooperation with the government, Mandela
says he will answer to that himself,'' Mrs. Mandela told reporters.
``As he said that, he looked very angry.''
   Mandela, 70, is recuperating from tuberculosis at the
Constantiaberg Clinic, a modern private hospital in Cape Town. He
became ill in August, and doctors expect him to make a complete
recovery in two to three months.
   Mrs. Mandela said she and her husband did not discuss the latest
wave of speculation that he may soon be freed after 26 years in
prison.
   ``All the rumors about his release are sheer rumors,'' she said.
   In addition to his wife, Mandela was visited for more than an
hour by his daughter, Zindzi, and her two children, as well as by
his sister, Leaby Piliso. It was the Mandelas' first reunion since
August.
   Mrs. Mandela declined to comment on political issues but said
her husband's health was improving.
   Botha, although refusing to be specific, has said in recent
weeks that he hopes Mandela will not have to return to Pollsmoor
Prison from the hospital. Government officials have indicated
Mandela might be freed without having to comply with Botha's
longstanding demand that he renounce violence.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962. He received a life sentence
in 1964 for plotting an ANC sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the
white-minority government.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire said after meeting with
Botha on Oct. 1 that the South African president had promised to
release Mandela unconditionally. Botha refused to confirm this, but
a pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, subsequently quoted
officials as saying Mandela could be released at any time starting
in mid-November.
   Mandela is the most popular leader among South Africa's
disenfranchised black majority. Government officials are wary that
his release could cause a new outbreak of black militancy and
unrest, but they also perceive that freeing Mandela could ease
international pressure on South Africa.
   In other developments:
   _An explosion early today outside a police barracks in
Kathlehong, a black township near Johannesburg, caused damage but
no injuries. The blast came 10 hours after a limpet mine exploded
at a Johannesburg bus depot, injuring four people. Most of the
roughly 80 bombings in South Africa this year have been blamed by
police on the African National Congress.
   _Govan Mbeki, 78, an ANC leader freed last year after 23 years
in prison, lost a court bid Friday to overturn restrictions placed
on him after his release. The activist, a co-defendant of
Mandela's, had challenged the legality of the emergency regulations
under which his restrictions were imposed.

   Iran has closed its border to Kurdish
refugees fleeing Iraq through Turkey, a Turkish official said. Iran
said today that accepting more Kurdish refugees would be a problem.
   Regional Gov. Hayri Kozakcioglu said Friday that Iran took in
2,178 Kurdish refugees from Turkey one month ago but then closed
its border.
   Kozakcioglu said 3,000 Kurdish refugees were taken this week in
buses and trucks from two tent cities in southeast Turkey to Alan,
a village on the Iranian border. But the Iranians refused to accept
the refugees, he said, and after a two-day wait at the border they
were taken back to the tent cities.
   Turkish news agencies say up to 19,000 Kurdish refugees have
voluntarily transferred to Iran.
   Iran's deputy prime minister, Ali-Reza Moayeri, was quoted today
by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying: ``Due to
early cold weather in the western border regions, the arrival of
fresh groups of Kurds will be difficult and dangerous.''
   Iran had offered to accept any of the 60,000 Kurdish refugees
who poured into Turkey starting in late August, after Iraq began an
offensive against the ethnic minority. The Kurds claim Iraq used
chemical weapons against them.
   Moayeri was quoted as saying Iran has accepted 100,000 Kurdish
refugees fleeing Iraq since an Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war. The Tehran government backed Kurdish separatists in
Iraq during the fighting.
   Taking more refugees will entail more problems for the refugees
and for Iran, Moayeri was quoted as saying by IRNA, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus.
   IRNA said Thursday that 32,000 Kurdish refugees from Turkey have
sought sanctuary in northwest Iran, including nearly 8,000 the last
few days, because of Ankara's ``reluctance to host them.''
   Kozakcioglu denied the report, saying ``such a legal transfer
was impossible as long as Iran kept its border closed.''
   But he said Turkey would not be able to control illegal
crossings into Iran because of the rough border terrain.
   Last week, 1,467 Kurds returned voluntarily from Turkey to Iraq,
which has offered an amnesty to those who fled. The rest of the
Kurdish refugees are settled in five tent cities in southeastern
Turkey.

   Assailants armed with axes and knives today
attacked an Israeli man on a business trip in the occupied West
Bank, the army said. The assault came after Israeli troops raided
three nearby villages.
   The 56-year-old businessman, whose name was not disclosed, was
rushed to the surgery ward of Afula hosptial suffering deep gashes
in his head, neck and back, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   Soldiers closed off access to Jenin, where the attack occurred,
and began searching for the assailants, who managed to steal their
victim's pistol before escaping, the spokesman said. The troops
made several arrests.
   In another incident, Palestinians threw stones at an Israel-Arab
couple visiting Jenin, the army said.
   Hours earlier, police and soldiers staged a nighttime raid on
the villages of Jalbun, Faqqua and Arabuna, near Jenin, Israel
radio reported.
   The security forces found a large cache of explosives, timers
and batteries used to manufacture bombs, the radio said.
   They arrested 20 Palestinians suspected of setting fire to
trees, blocking roads, hoisting outlawed Palestinian flags and
participating in disturbances. The radio said the West Bank
Palestinians operated inside Israel.
   Also today, soldiers opened fire with plastic bullets in Rafah,
the southernmost town in the occupied Gaza Strip, wounding two
Palestinians during a stone-throwing demonstration, the army
command said. Both Palestinians were shot in the leg and taken to
hospital in Khan Yunis.
   Israeli officials estimate that 7,000 Arabs have been wounded in
the occupied territories since the Palestinian uprising began Dec.
8. Palestinian sources put the number at about 18,000. At least 297
Palestinians and six Israelis have died during the uprising.

   Mohawk Indians briefly blocked
the Seaway International Bridge to the United States to protest a
police raid on suspected drug and cigarette smugglers in the
Akwesasne Indian Reserve.
   The Indians used their cars Friday night to block the bridge for
about 10 minutes in both directions and nailed a sign to an
immigration booth that read: ``This is Indian land _ Mohawk land.
No trespassing.''
   The bridge connects Cornwall Island in the St. Lawrence Seaway
with mainland Canada to the north and New York to the south. The
reserve, where 100,000 Indians live, is located on the island.
   The raid was carried out Thursday by 250 heavily armed Canadian
police with 75 cruisers, 15 vans, unmarked cars, helicopters,
boats, bulldozers and dogs trained to sniff out illegal drugs.
   Seven people were arrested and large quantities of illegal
cigarettes, some drugs and weapons worth $200,000 were seized,
police said. The raid was one of the largest in the 18-month
attempt to stop Mohawk Indians from bringing duty-free cigarettes
from the United States for resale in Canada.
   Some Indians called for retaliation. ``We were raped,'' said
Francis Boot, a bus driver whose home was one of 12 raided on the
island. ``It was no different than if the (U.S.) 7th Cavalry had
come across and attacked us.''
   Boots scoffed at the police description of what was seized,
describing it instead as ``some cigarettes and a couple of useless
pistols.'' But police said their search turned up restricted
weapons, marijuana and cocaine.
   Mohawk Grand Chief Mike Mitchell appealed for calm among his
people, but Boots said he and others have contacted ``our brothers
and sisters in New York and Montreal'' to join in meetings to
discuss a unified reaction to the raid.
   The raid was similar to one in May in the Kahnawake Reserve just
south of Montreal in which 17 people were arrested for selling
illegal cigarettes.

<TEXT>
   If you woke up bored, don't go back to bed quite yet. Oct. 16th
has a better chance than most days of finding a significant niche
in history, and you'd feel awful if you missed it.
   The date has started and ended eras, scrambled the balance of
power, and marched us off toward war or to the edge of it.
   There are other days of historical coincidence that loom large,
of course.
   ``There was July 4, and not just because of the independence,''
said Robert Sellen, professor of American history at Georgia State
University.
   John Adams and Thomas Jefferson died on July 4, exactly 50 years
after the signing, Sellen noted, ``and people marveled at this at
the time, these two old heroes of independence dying together.
   ``It was seen as a symbol, nobody was sure of what.''
   Neither is anybody sure why all of these beginnings and endings
fell on Oct. 16:
   _In 1793, Queen Marie Antoinette, whose extravagance and ``let
them eat cake'' attitude toward the poor made her a symbol and
cause of the French Revolution, went to the guillotine in Paris. It
was the end of the old order and France would never be the same
again. With the stability of the continent's monarchies in
question, neither would Europe.
   _In 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte arrived at the island of Saint
Helena off the west African coast where he was exiled after his
loss to the British at Waterloo. The exile gave some finality _
again _ to the end of the Napoleonic wars that shredded Europe.
Earlier, he escaped from exile on Elba off the coast of Italy and
nearly regained his power. This time he stayed put and died on
Saint Helena in 1821.
   _In 1846, a Boston dentist, William Morton, demonstrated the use
of ether as an anesthetic during a jaw operation. Try to imagine
medicine today without that first step.
   _In 1859, abolitionist John Brown led his raid on the federal
arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Va. (now W.Va.), in what was to have
triggered a slave uprising. It didn't, and Brown went to the
gallows six weeks later. The memory of Brown and his raid became a
rallying cry to turn out Northern support for the war against the
Confederacy.
   _In 1916, Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic
in the United States on the revolutionary _ some said blasphemous _
contention that the poor should be able to control the size of
their families. She founded Planned Parenthood, which has
influenced the lives of millions.
   _In 1946, 10 Nazi war criminals, who personified the worst of
Hitler's outrages, were hanged in Germany.
   _In 1962, the Cuban missile crisis began with President Kennedy
ordering a blockade of Cuba that brought the United States and the
Soviet Union as close to nuclear war as they have ever been. The
Soviets agreed to remove the missiles and Kennedy lifted the
blockade.
   _In 1964, China became the fifth member of the nuclear club,
exploding its first atomic bomb near Sinkiang.
   _In 1970, Anwar Sadat, who defied his Moslem neighbors and was
isolated by them for holding peace talks with Israel, was elected
president of Egypt. His decision made the Camp David peace talks
possible.
   _In 1978 the College of Cardinals snapped the 456-year-old
Italian monopoly on the papacy by electing Cardinal Karol Wojtyla
of Poland as Pope John Paul II.

   A man who was allegedly trying to plant a
bomb in a woman's car because he was angry over her rejection of a
marriage proposal suffered a severe arm injury when the device
exploded, authorities said.
   The man, identified as Roger Rush, 33, was booked into a
hospital jail ward and held for investigation of exploding a bomb
and causing injury, police Officer Bill Frio said.
   ``It was a case of unrequited love,'' said Lt. Fred Nixon, a
police spokesman. ``He had proposed marriage several times, but she
told him to go away.''
   Bomb squad members found a second explosive device, a rifle and
a crossbow in the man's car. Rush apparently drove the car for
several blocks after the explosion at 5:30 a.m. Friday.

<HEAD>Emperor's Vital Signs Stablize, Concern Mounts Over Jaundice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's vital signs stabilized Saturday,
but doctors were concerned about his worsening anemia and jaundice,
palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old emperor's temperature, which went above 100.4
degrees on Friday, declined to 99.1 degrees Saturday night. His
normal temperature is about 95.9 degrees.
   Physicians gave the emperor another 0.84 pints of blood to help
counteract his anemia and internal bleeding, palace officials said.
   ``His condition as a whole is leveling off,'' said Kenji Maeda,
Imperial Household Agency spokesman. ``But the blood transfusion
was given to improve his condition, particularly his anemia.''
   The world's longest-reigning living monarch has been bedridden
since Sept. 19, when he vomited a large amount of blood because of
an intestinal hemorrhage. He has received a total of 16.6 pints of
blood since then.
   Maeda said Hirohito discharged a small amount of blood from his
bowels Saturday afternoon, an indication of continued intestinal
bleeding.
   News reports have quoted palace officials as saying the level of
bile in the emperor's blood, an indication of jaundice, could be 30
times the normal level. A palace source declined to confirm the
reports but said the jaundice was causing concern for doctors.
   The emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of the
unity of Japan.

   A tropical storm destroyed 80 homes in

and killed two fishermen whose boat capsized, Vietnamese radio said
Saturday.
   Initial reports said constant, heavy rains from Tuesday to
Friday damaged 172,970 acres of newly planted corn, potato and rice
fields in central province of Nghe Tinh, the Voice of Vietnam said.
Up to 19.7 inches fell in some places.
   ``The accompanying whirlwinds pulled down some 80 dwelling
houses and capsized two fishing boats, killing two fishermen,''
said the broadcast, monitored in Bangkok.
   An earlier domestic Radio Hanoi broadcast said heavy rains
caused flash floods in other provinces in recent days, damaging
rice fields, roads and rail lines.
   Tropical storms annually cause considerable damage to the
Vietnamese economy.

<HEAD>Iran Will Not Accept More Kurdish Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has accepted 100,000 Kurdish
refugees fleeing from Iraq, and accepting more would be a problem,
an Iranian official was quoted Saturday as saying.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Ali-Reza
Moayeri, deputy prime minister, as saying, ``Due to early cold
weather in the western border regions, the arrival of fresh groups
of Kurds will be difficult and dangerous.''
   A Kurdish spokesman said Thursday that Turkey has forced 30,000
Kurds into Iran last week, where they were crammed into overcrowded
camps.
   Moayeri spent Friday in Turkey discussing the refugee problem
with Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz and
other government officials, said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia. It
said Moayeri described the talks as friendly.
   A Turkish offical said Friday that Iran closed its border with
Turkey to prevent any more crossings by Kurdish refugees who fled
Iraq during an army offensive against them. The Kurds said they
were fleeing chemical bomb attacks.
   Regional Gov. Hayri Kozakcioglu said that Iran received 2,178
Kurdish refugees from Turkey a month ago but then closed its border
to the refugees, saying it had no shelter for them.
   Iraq started its offensive against the Kurds in August, soon
after Iran agreed to the cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iran
war. The Kurds, who are seeking autonomy for their region, sided
with Iran during the war.
   Moyaeri criticized the world reaction to the Kurdish claims of
chemical bomb attacks.
   ``Unfortunately the world has not shown a proper reaction to the
Iraqi atrocities against the Kurds,'' he said. ``Neither Iran nor
Turkey have received aid for the Kurdish refugees.''
   Taking more refugees will entail more problems for the refugees
and for Iran, Moayeri said. He said both countries will try to work
for improved existing conditions for the refugees.
   About 20 million Kurds live in the mountainous region where the
borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq converge. They have fought
periodically in all three countries for more than 80 years for
autonomy.

<TEXT>
   In the bustling markets that line the
dusty, winding alleys and the parched Kabul River, war seems far
away until one looks at the clear, sunny sky.
   Helicopters chug inside the perimeter of mountains whose ridges
are lined with radar installations and outposts of Afghan and
Soviet armed forces.
   Attack jets and big military transport planes drop flares
designed to divert heat-seeking missiles.
   Just beyond the ridges are Moslem guerrillas, battling the
Soviet troops and the forces of Afghanistan's Soviet-style
government.
   Most days at least a few rockets are launched at the capital,
usually landing in random fashion on homes, streets and sometimes
in or near a military installation.
   ``We don't know when or where they will come,'' said a young
civil servant who recently returned from the Soviet Union where she
studied Russian and English. ``They can kill you. They can kill me.
They can kill someone else.''
   On the outskirts of the city, Soviet and Afghan troops man
concrete bunker checkpoints. Closer to the center, there are Afghan
checkpoints.
   But in the marketplace, there's little feeling of imminent
disaster.
   Men in brown robes and white turbans sit cross-legged in front
of piles of purplish-black onions, red tomatoes and oblong melons.
A one-legged man on crutches sells gaudily colored ski-pant-style
long underwear in anticipation of winter in this city where
nighttime temperatures are already nippy.
   A Kabul University student wheels his bicycle along the potholed
lanes, his 7-year-old daughter seated on the crossbar.
   ``There is so much fighting,'' he said. ``The Soviets must leave
our country.''
   The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan began four months ago,
and the remaining 50,000 to 60,000 Soviet soldiers are scheduled to
be gone by Feb. 15, 1989, under a United Nations-mediated agreement
signed in Geneva last April.
   The student spoke in English he said he had learned from classes
at the American Cultural Center _ classes that ended after the
Soviet Union dispatched troops to Afghanistan in 1979 to support a
communist regime under attack from the guerrillas.
   At the Kabul Zoo, packs of small boys, a few families and
turbaned Tajik tribesmen who just arrived from the Soviet border
province of Jawzjan wander around the dusty park, staring at
colorful birds, rabbits and a weary-looking elephant.
   The small boys were more intrigued by the lone foreigner in the
zoo than by the animals. When they learned the foreigner was
American, not Soviet, they led the way to the enclosure of a
Russian brown bear.
   Giggling and pointing at the shaggy beast, they chanted
``sharabi, sharabi'' _ the Dari word for ``Soviet.''
   The crowd thinned out with the approach of a man in a thick
gray-green woolen uniform and a Soviet-designed pistol tucked in
his waistband.
   He identified himself as Habib, a veterinarian and a member of
the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan that has dominated the
government for the last decade.
   ``The party is the right way,'' Habib said.
   He had spent the last three months in Kandahar, a southern
provincial capital under siege by the anti-government guerrillas.
   He said he was neither a soldier nor a policeman, but he
declined to explain the significance of his military-style uniform
that carried no insignia.
   Asked if he was worried now that Soviet troops are withdrawing
from Afghanistan, Habib said he did not fear the guerrillas.
   ``I am not afraid of the Mujahedeen. If a Mujahed wants to kill
me, I will kill him.''
   But Habib said he has not returned to his home province of
Kapisa, on the northeast edge of Kabul province, for several years.
He said he came from a part of Kapisa near the Panjshir valley,
which is held by one of the most powerful local rebel commanders,
Ahmad Shah Masood.
   ``The Mujahedeen killed by brother,'' Habib said. ``If I go
back, they may kill me because I am with the government.''

   With their striped shirts and academic
degrees, Israel's new ``yuppie'' politicians have traded the
rough-and-tumble Moshe Dayan style for a more image-conscious
approach.
   The new generation running in the Nov. 1 elections range in
background from sons of leaders to lawyers to Sephardi, immigrants
from poor backgrounds in North Africa.
   Among the candidates are men with well-known names like Benjamin
Begin, son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and
lesser-known figures like Yossi Beilin, who gained experience as an
aide to Labor Party leader and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   The leaders next in line for both parties are more pragmatic
than their ideology-bound predecessors about Israel's biggest
problem, the Palestinians.
   They also have parted with the old world manners and casual,
open-shirt dress of first-generation Israeli politicians such as
David Ben-Gurion, soldier and politician Dayan, or Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
   ``We don't kiss a lady's hand like our mentors did,'' said Roni
Milo, 39, a rising star with the rightist Likud bloc, who who was
referring to the sometimes courtly behavior of Polish-born Menachem
Begin, founder of the Likud.
   ``We're more direct, sabra style, and more pragmatic. We young
people are more capable of growing accustomed to new conditions,''
Milo added, flashing a boyish smile.
   Milo's background is typical of many politicians his age of
European descent. He is a sabra, a native-born Israel, and a lawyer
who did party work in student government at Tel Aviv University. He
inherited hawkish political beliefs from parents who fought the
British in Begin's Irgun underground.
   His career flourished after he won a seat in Parliament in 1977
with a Likud victory in national elections.
   A second Likud deputy with leadership potential is Ehud Olmert,
42, also a lawyer who, despite his hard line on the Arab-Israeli
conflict, has maintained quiet contacts with Palestinians from the
occupied territories.
   ``We have a more pragmatic approach,'' Olmert said of himself
and his generation in Likud. ``Yes, we're against the PLO but we
know we have to strike an agreement with the Palestinians.''
   Unlike Likud's younger politicians, most of the new faces who
are certain to win election from the rival Labor Party will be
taking their first Parliament seats after next month's vote.
   Although they lack legislative experience, some newcomers
already have considerable influence.
   Beilin, 40, is a former Cabinet secretary with a doctorate in
political science who became an adviser to Peres a decade ago. He
also is more moderate than Peres toward the Palestinians. ``I am
willing to speak to the PLO provided that it meets conditions'' of
recognizing Israel and formally declaring a ban on terrorism.
   Israel's government objects to any dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, claiming it is a terrorist organization.
   Another fresh face in Labor, Avraham Burg, 33, is the son of
Yosef Burg, who until he retired last year was religious affairs
minister and the longest-serving member of Israel's Knesset, or
parliament.
   The younger Burg, also a former adviser to Peres, insists his
father had nothing to do with his decision to enter politics.
Instead, it was opposition to Israel's three-year war in Lebanon
that got him interested.
   Burg was injured in parachute training in 1979, but he fought as
a volunteer with his unit in Lebanon in 1982, then became a leading
opponent of Israel's Lebanon war.
   ``I never thought before of being a politician,'' he said. ``But
then I thought, we are a society undergoing many processes, some of
them difficult, incorrect, fatal. Either you bury your head deep in
the sand or you try to do something.''
   Burg, the spokesman for Labor's campaign, says resolving the
Palestinian uprising in the disputed West Bank and Gaza Strip is
one of Israel's main necessities.
   ``The occupation corrupts us. This is a tough process the
Israeli population is going through. The main moral issue is ending
the occupation and finding a solution.''
   The other pattern of developing leadership in Labor and Likud
are the small-town mayors, mostly of Sephardi origin, who now have
prominent places on both parties' slates.
   Moroccan-born Eli Dayan, 38, the mayor of Ashkelon, is an
example from Labor.
   Dayan, who is not related to the late Israeli war hero, told
reporters recently that he saw his achievements as a boost to the
nation's disadvantaged development towns that are home mostly to
Middle Eastern or North African Jews.
   ``At one time these parties were closed to the people from these
towns,'' he said. ``Now we can be candidates for the Knesset.''
   Some Israeli analysts believe the new generation of politicians
is too willing to compromise and lacks the ideological vision of
the country's founders.
   ``They're all the same, whether in Labor or Likud, yuppies and
opportunists,'' said Gabi Sheffer, a political scientist at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. ``They're the product of growing
materialism in Israeli society, they reflect the less idealistic
society we have become.''

<HEAD>Magazine Apologizes For Calling Atlanta Suburb `Redneck'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Geographic magazine has offered
a soft apology to the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna for referring to it
as ``redneck'' in its July issue.
   The reference, in an article about Atlanta, came in the sentence
``No matter where I went _ from redneck Smyrna in the northwest to
downtown's black Atlanta University to the old-money bastions of
Ansley Park _ Atlantans described their town indulgently as
adolescent.''
   Magazine spokesman Barbara Moffitt said the magazine had
received more than 50 letters, most of them from angry Smyrna
residents.
   Smyrna resident Linda Farmer's letter in the November issue
accused author Erla Zwingle of ``uninhibited myopic vision'' and
said her neck may not be red ``but your collective face should be.''
   ``It is,'' was the editorial reply.
   Associate editor Bart McDowell acknowledged that some, but not
all, people take offense at the use of the word and that while the
magazine might use it again it would think twice about using it on
a person or place.
   ``It's a marvelous, colorful expression and I certainly don't
think it should be dropped out of our lexicon,'' he said.

<HEAD>Goldwater: Dukakis, Bush Should Talk About Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential candidate Barry Goldwater
says George Bush may have ``impugned the patriotism of Michael
Dukakis'' in a campaign he says has been so negative that ``as an
American citizen, I'm dammned concerned about where we're going.''
   He urged both Bush and Dukakis to ``quit calling each other
names'' and concentrate on important issues, such as how they would
handle the nation's huge debt and federal budget deficits.
   In an interview, Goldwater, who retired two years ago as
Arizona's senior Republican senator, said also he believes Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, has stronger qualifications to become
president than does Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
   But Goldwater also said of Bush: ``I don't think I've known a
man in my life who comes to the chance of being president who is
better qualified.''
   He believes Bush will ``win rather big,'' carrying half or more
of the 50 states, and added: ``I think I know generally what George
Bush stands for. I'm very much for him. I think he'll make a good
president.''
   While Goldwater said he was surprised by the choice of Quayle,
he is ``very prejudiced'' in the 41-year-old senator's favor
because he has known him and his family for years and thought
Quayle did a ``superb'' job in handling a Senate Armed Services
panel on military procurement.
   Goldwater admitted that despite his closeness to Quayle, the
question of whether the Hoosier senator is equipped to be
president, should he ever be called on to do so, is an obvious one.
   He said it is an impossible question to answer and raised the
possibility that, like Harry Truman, Quayle might grow with the
job, should it become necessary.
   ``I'll admit this,'' Goldwater volunteered. ``The man running
for vice president on the Democrat ticket is, I think, a little
better equipped.''
   ``I've known him longer,'' Goldwater said of Bentsen. ``He's
been in the Senate longer. And he's bound to have picked up many
things that Quayle hasn't had a chance to pick up.''
   Goldwater, 79, said he is ready to return to Phoenix, having
just sold the Washington apartment he occupied for decades. He is
publicizing his new autobiography, ``Goldwater,'' a tartly worded
view of his life and the personalities with whom he has worked and
clashed in a career which spanned four decades.
   Goldwater, who was subjected to harshly negative campaign
advertisements during his 1964 presidential campaign against Lyndon
Johnson, made no secret of his distaste for the 1988 campaign.
   ``I don't like the campaign, from what I've seen of it and heard
of it,'' Goldwater said. ``I don't think that either man has been
talking about the issues.''
   He said this and the negative tone of the campaign has resulted
in widespread apathy, which he said may result for the first time
in history of a turn out of less than 50 percent of the nation's
registered voters.
   In last week's debate, Bush said Goldwater couldn't know what
the issues are because the press has not been reporting on them.
Goldwater had asked Quayle to ``tell George Bush to start talking
about the issues.''
   ``George took after me, asking how I could know what was going
on when I was living way out in Arizona,'' Goldwater said and
added: ``You'd be surprised at what we know out there.''
   Responding to questions, Goldwater refered to both Bush and
Dukakis and said: ``I think the whole camaign has been negative.''
   ``They both denied that, saying they had put out position
papers,'' he said. ``Nobody reads position papers.''
   `I've been giving both candidates a bad time for this negative
campaiging at a very, very important time in our history....As an
American citizen I'm just damned concerned about where we're
going.''
   Goldwater was asked about Bush's attack on Dukakis for the
governor's veto of legislation requiring all Massachusetts school
children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Calling the pledge a ``very big part of Americana,'' Goldwater
added: ``I don't think it deserved spending more than one or two
lectures on.''
   Then, referring to other aspects of the Bush attack, Goldwater
said the GOP candidate ``talked about the dirt in the harbors in
Massachusetts, the fact that Dukakis has given leave to convicted
murderers.''
   ``That's not going to bother the guy out in Timbuktu,'' he said.
``That guy wants to know how the hell are we going to get out of
debt.''
   He said he was not able to respond with certainty to the
question of whether Bush has impugned the integrity of Michael
Dukakis.
   But after a pause, he added: ``I have a hunch that he probably
has.''
   What does that say about the shape of American presidential
politics?
   ``Bad shape,'' Goldwater replied. ``It doesn't speak well for
the political system. The American people do not like negative
advertising or negative campaigning. They'd like to be told what's
on these fellows' minds about how to get the country in order.''

<HEAD>Scotland Yard To Investigate Publication of Royal Picture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scotland Yard appointed the head of its serious
crimes branch Saturday to investigate a tabloid's publication of a
private royal family photograph.
   But a Conservative Party lawmaker criticized the appointment of
such a high officer, saying it is like sending in commandos to nab
a parking offender.
   Commander Roy Penrose, 46, former head of the drug squad, will
lead an inquiry to discover how The Sun, a 4.15-million-circulation
newspaper, obtained the snapshot of the queen, her mother
Elizabeth, and the Duchess of York cradling her infant daughter
Princess Beatrice.
   The Conservative lawmaker, Geoffrey Dickens, protested the
``Gilbert and Sullivan'' situation in which Scotland Yard assigned
Penrose to deal with ``this piddling affair.''
   ``We must presume that the Lord High Executioner is waiting in
the wings to do his stuff when the hapless culprit is found. It is
like sending in the SAS (commandos) to deal with a parking
offender,'' he said.
   After the picture appeared on the front page of Thursday's Sun,
the queen told her lawyers to consider action against the paper.
   Buckingham Palace said it was taken by an unidentified friend of
the royal family and ``was published without the permission of the
queen or any member of the royal family or the person who took the
photograph.''
   The Sun defied the queen by again publishing the photo in its
first edition on Friday but withdrew it from later editions and
offered to return it ``when it is established who is the owner.''
The paper promised not to publish it again or reproduce it
elsewhere.
   In an editorial Saturday, The Sun said its ``crime'' was to
publish ``a delightful picture'' that readers loved and that the
queen should have been proud to share with her subjects.
   The paper said it was ``hurt'' by the palace's reaction but
apologized: ``Sorry, Ma'am. No offense meant.'' The Sun gave no
explanation of how the picture was obtained.
   The appointment of Commander Penrose was announced in a
one-sentence Scotland Yard statement.
   Buckingham Palace refused to comment, saying only that it was
advised that Scotland Yard was investigating the matter.
   Dickens said he planned to ask Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who
is in charge of the police, to issue guidelines on the ``sensible
use of police resources.''
   Buckingham Palace has released only a few official photos of
Princess Beatrice, the queen's fifth grandchild, who was born on
Aug. 8. They were taken by the baby's father, Prince Andrew, the
queen's second son.
   Although posed, the photo which appeared in The Sun was informal
and relaxed, showing the queen and her mother in Scottish tartans.
   Under British law, copyright on a photograph lies with the
photographer.
   Television news programs, when reporting the controversy, have
blacked out the picture when showing The Sun's front page.
   The first recorded case of the royal family going to the courts
was in 1911 when King George V brought a libel action against an
anti-royalist who claimed in a Paris paper that the king married an
admiral's daughter 20 years earlier.

<HEAD>Plea Agreement Admits Scams Reminiscent Of Political Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scams were so familiar that at times a
federal prosecutor had to remind himself he was trailing a major
defense contractor, and not just another small-time operator
feeding at the public trough.
   The fraud investigation of the Sundstrand Corp. revealed the
destruction of memos and internal reports, creative accounting,
favors paid to government officials, hidden ownership, even a
charge to the government for personal expenses like golfing and dog
kennel fees.
   It was an easy path to follow for a federal prosecutor schooled
in the shenanigans of Chicago's City Hall.
   ``I think as in most public corruption cases, the people at
Sundstrand developed the attitude that these kinds of things were
part of the cost of doing business,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas
said.
   ``They probably thought that prosecution would be too complex,
or that the government wouldn't follow through ... or that even if
the company did get caught, it could settle up civilly.
   ``But we took the same approach we take in other corruption
cases. And by the time you factor in the additional problems of
criminal charges, it becomes so expensive that they won't even look
at this kind of thing any more.''
   Sundstrand agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to a four-count
criminal complaint charging that it overbilled the Pentagon for
airplane parts and to pay $115 million in fines and penalties, the
largest fraud settlement ever.
   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of Sundstrand's
$1.4 billion in annual sales.
   The company has declined to comment on the plea agreement,
except to say it was a step toward putting the scandal behind it.
   But the matter may be far from over. A federal grand jury is
considering charges against Sundstrand employees. And there remains
the possibility of further administrative fines against the
Rockford-based company, and the suspension of its right to bid on
future defense contracts.
   The plea agreement revealed several separate schemes to defraud
the government. It also indicated that improprieties climbed at
least into the supervisory level and possibly higher.
   ``Company officials set out to get contracts in instances where
they knew well in advance they couldn't perform for the fixed
price,'' Valukas said. ``What flowed from that were a number of
different attempts to hide the overruns.''
   The complaint alleges those practices continued from August 1981
through June 1985 _ but that Sundstrand employees were ordered in
April 1984 to destroy an internal report and work papers that
suggested management officials were aware they were not complying
with government regulations.
   Of even longer-standing practice was Sundstrand's willingness to
pay gratuities _ ranging from wine to theater tickets to golf
outings _ to Defense Department personnel to win business, and then
hide the government employees' names. The employees were not
identified in the complaint.
   A 1980 company directive ordered that the names be given to
supervisors orally, or in writing on small slips of paper that were
immediately destroyed. And even after the Pentagon issued new rules
on gratuities for defense officials, Sundstrand told supervisors
that salesmen could continue to write ``customer'' on their expense
accounts instead of the public employees' names.
   The complaint also charges Sundstrand engaged in a third
cover-up, moving spare aircraft parts to a warehouse owned by a
Wisconsin company, then concealing the extent of its ownership to
prevent the Internal Revenue Service from disallowing millions of
dollars in tax writeoffs.
   A fourth count charged that other overhead accounts submitted to
the government attempted to disguise luxuries for Sundstrand
executives ranging from saunas and radar detectors to snow plowing
and servants.
   The federal charges were not the first indication that something
was wrong.
   Col. Francis Holland, Chicago regional commander of Defense
Contract Administration Services, told the Chicago Tribune that
government auditors had uncovered millions of dollars in
improprieties by late 1982.
   And he said internal audit memos that made the rounds at the
company should have ``raised red flags'' as well.
   ``No one in Sundstrand can say `Gee whiz, this is just a minor
thing and no one paid any attention to it,''' Holland recalled.
   Yet his agency, which monitors contracts after they are awarded
by other sections of the Defense Department, negotiated with
Sundstrand for two years on how much the company should repay the
government before turning to criminal investigators.

<HEAD>Classified Soviet Maps To Be Made Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maps of the Soviet Union that long have been
classified for fear they might help spies or saboteurs will be made
public next year, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   ``The `secret' stamp is being removed'' to permit printing of
457 new maps and atlases based on the classified charts, with 249
titles scheduled to be printed in 1989 alone, the Sovietskaya
Rossiya daily said.
   ``Until very recently ... anyone who managed to see them could
be condemned as an enemy of the people,'' it said.
   The chief Soviet mapmaker, Viktor R. Yashchenko, told the
government newspaper Izvestia last month that roads, rivers and
even entire towns had been intentionally misplaced or left off
public maps over the past half-century under orders of the secret
police.
   He said the distortions began in the 1930s under Soviet leader
Josef Stalin and continued until this year.
   ``People did not recognize their own homeland on maps,'' he said
at the time. ``Tourists tried in vain to orient themselves to
locations.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the new, more detailed maps stemmed
from ``glasnost,'' the drive for openness pushed by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Among the new titles planned are a road atlas, collections of
maps of cities including Moscow and Leningrad, and hikers' atlases
for the Caucasus mountains and the coasts of the Black Sea and Sea
of Azov, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   A senior Soviet diplomat arrived in
Kabul on Saturday to take up his post as ambassador in an
indication of Moscow's desire to retain a strong influence over its
southern neighbor.
   A Soviet Embassy official said First Deputy Foreign Minister
Yuli Vorontsov would present his credentials to the Afghan
government within three days.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity and said he was unable to
give any details of Vorontsov's schedule.
   Vorontsov has worked closely with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, who in turn is close to President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Such senior Kremlin officials rarely double as foreign ambassadors.
   The change coincides with a stepped-up Soviet and Afghan
campaign for a negotiated end to the fighting that has pitted
Afghan and Soviet troops against U.S.- and Pakistan-backed Moslem
guerrillas.
   Last week, the Soviet Union pledged $800 million to the U.N.
fund for rebuilding Afghanistan _ nearly half the $2 billion the
United Nations says is needed in the next five years.
   Moscow Radio's English-language program heard in Kabul on
Saturday noted that the Soviet Union had pledged such a large sum
while, according to the broadcast, the United States was slow to
respond with a similar amount.
   An expected meeting of the Central Committee of the People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan has prompted speculation among both
Western and non-Western diplomats that a change in party leadership
may be forthcoming.
   President Najib heads the Afghan government and is also
secretary-general of the party.
   A veteran, non-Western diplomat said he doubted the Soviet Union
would want to see a new Afghan president until the Red Army's
withdrawal is completed.
   ``Why should they want the government to change before they get
their children home?'' he asked.
   Under the U.N.-mediated agreement worked out in April in Geneva,
the Soviet Union is to complete the withdrawal of its troops by
Feb. 15, 1989. The withdrawal started May 15 and is now half over,
with an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 Soviet soldiers remaining in
Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.

   A man accused of driving away from a
convenience store without paying for his gasoline was locked inside
the store when he returned three days later and was recognized by
an employee, police said.
   Assistant manager Mitzie McClain said she walked into her store
Friday and saw the man she had seen on Tuesday. She then locked the
door and told clerk Roberta King to call police.
   The man, Luther Irving Butler, didn't talk much during his short
incarceration in the convenience store, Ms. McClain said. At one
point, however, he did offer to pay for the gas.
   But she refused, saying she was tired of people driving away
without paying for gas. The store has been victimized by gasoline
thieves four times this month, King said.
   When police arrived, they arrested Butler, 37, on complaints of
larceny of gasoline and public drunkenness and took him to the
Oklahoma City Jail.

<HEAD>Bush to Stick to Proven Themes, Big States in Final Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, riding the momentum of last
week's debate, will focus on proven themes and big states as he
tries to hold or expand his lead in the final three weeks of the
presidential campaign, aides say.
   They say he will not stray far from the themes he has already
honed on the campaign trail _ crime, the death penalty, prison
furloughs in Massachusetts, a strong military _ and will break
little if any new ground on issues.
   Although Bush is enjoying a widening lead in public opinion
polls over Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, he and
his top campaign officials are insisting they will not permit
themselves to become complacent.
   ``That's the last thing I want to have happen,'' Bush said at
week's end as it became clear his campaign was enjoying a
post-debate surge.
   While maintaining a busy schedule, Bush can be expected to run a
cautious, play-it-safe campaign in the days ahead.
   That means sticking to his basic campaign stump speech, speaking
mostly before friendly audiences, having few news conferences and
seldom departing from a well-rehearsed script.
   Bush himself told reporters, ``I don't feel any pressure to put
out a lot of new programs'' at this stage in the campaign. ``We've
got a lot of programs out there.''
   He conceded that ``you'll see a lot of similarity'' in his
campaign speeches in the next three weeks with the tried-and-tested
themes he's been hammering on since the Republican convention last
August.
   Above all, Bush as well as his top advisers are saying they will
take nothing for granted.
   Asked by reporters how he assessed the debate, he said at one
point, ``Read my smile.''
   But he also said, ``You're talking to a guy who, when the polls
were going the other way, said `it isn't over.' And it wasn't. So
why should I now suddenly have the luxury of changing my position?''
   ``Watch how hard we work,'' Bush said, echoing the sentiment of
his campaign chairman, James A. Baker III, who cautioned senior
aides on Friday to _ above all else _ avoid becoming cocky or
viewing a Bush election as inevitable.
   ``There's a 100 percent chance of getting into trouble if you
get smug and overconfident,'' added campaign manager Lee Atwater.
``We don't intend to do that.''
   Bush in the coming days will travel mostly to large states where
polls show the election remains close.
   After leaving California, where he has been since last Tuesday
and where the stakes may be the highest in the country, Bush plans
campaign visits in pivotal Midwestern states.
   Aides also said Bush plans to keep returning to New Jersey and
will even spend some time campaigning in New York _ where recent
polls suggest the state's 36 electoral votes may be within striking
distance, despite a wide early lead by Dukakis.
   ``We're going to concentrate on the Electoral College _
California, New York, Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey,'' Atwater said.
``The vice president's base is secure in the South and the West.''
   Bill Lacy, Bush's California coordinator, said the vice
president's performance in last Thursday's debate, which generally
got high marks from Americans responding to a variety of surveys,
will help in California.
   Still, the state, with its rich bounty of 47 electoral votes, is
still up for grabs, Lacy said in an interview.
   He noted that Bush at one point last summer had been as much as
18 points behind in California. But he said, ``Polls in the last
few weeks have shown it to be a very close race so we're going to
keep pressing and keep pushing as hard as we can.''
   Bush will also be courting the ``Reagan Democrats,''
traditionally Democratic voters _ many of them blue-collar workers
_ who bolted in 1980 and 1984 to vote for President Reagan.
   Early polls showed many of these Democrats were not ready to
give the same support to Bush but more recent surveys suggest some
are moving in that direction.
   Bush will spend most of this week in the Midwest, and much of
the campaigning, particularly in industrial areas, will be aimed at
these Reagan Democrats.
   ``They respond to issues like crime, prison furloughs, gun
control, defense, the death penalty, the nuclear freeze and the
ACLU,'' Atwater said. ``Bush needs 35 percent of the Reagan
Democrats to win the election and he's in the neighborhood of 50
percent now.''

   Michael Dukakis' strategy of containing George
Bush's built-in campaign advantage in the South and West appears to
be crumbling rapidly as Republicans paint him as an unreconstructed
liberal, according to the polls and political experts.
   Dukakis advisers reject any talk of a GOP Electoral College
``lock'' in these reliably Republican regions. But they concede
that Bush's aggressive campaign _ television commercials included _
has forced them to scramble to remain competitive in even a
relative handful of states.
   One adviser, Charlie Baker, says the talk of a solid Republican
South is a calculated attempt by the Bush campaign to create an
impression that the race is over, and thus discourage voters from
going to the polls. ``They believe that if more people vote they
lose,'' he said.
   ``If they had a lock in the West, George Bush wouldn't be
spending two days in Colorado,'' he said, citing one example of a
close state.
   Still, polls do indicate Bush has solidified his position in the
South and West in the past few weeks. And Dukakis has clearly cut
back efforts in some states, including Florida, though maintaining
a costly effort in running mate Lloyd Bentsen's Texas as well as a
few scattered others.
   Merle Black, a political scientist at the University of North
Carolina, believes Dukakis' efforts to control the Southern damage
are doomed.
   ``I think you're going to see Bush sweep the region,'' he said
in a prediction before Thursday night's debate in which the vice
president was rated a winner.
   Depending on which side is doing the counting, Bush's built-in
advantage in the two regions runs to 100 to 170 electoral votes or
so, out of 270 needed for victory. That's a powerful foundation on
which to base his nationwide campaign, and Dukakis has nothing
comparable.
   Black said voters in the South are ``suspicious about liberals
and people who want to use the federal government to change their
lives, and George Bush has been able to capitalize.''
   In part, he said, that's the residue of racial tension from
civil rights battles. ``The more blacks there are relative to
whites, the more conservative'' the whites tend to be, he said.
   He also said Bush's strength results in part from the social
conservatism of voters in the area on issues such as gun control
and the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Says Bush Southern adviser Lanny Griffith, ``Ronald Reagan has
done a lot to leave the Sunbelt as a Republican-based region in the
presidential election. It's real important that in the first
election (after Reagan) we were able to put that together again.''
   In the West, Bush adviser Tom Hockaday says Democrats feel
``ideological differences'' with candidates on the national ticket
that cause them to vote Republican. He said Democratic governors
and senators ``tend to be more conservative'' than presidential
candidates, and issues such as water rights, gun control and the
death penalty highlight the differences between Bush and Dukakis.
   Griffith ticks off a string of campaign issues that he says the
vice president has highlighted. ``Crime, death penalty, gun
control, the furlough program (in Massachusetts), national defense,
values like prayer in public schools, the Pledge of Allegiance,
Contra aid. These are all stronger the further south you get.''
   Among the border states, he said Arkansas and Kentucky were two
where Dukakis remained competitive through late last week.
   Democrats counter that going into last week's debate, they were
ahead in Arkansas and competitive in Kentucky, Tennessee, North
Carolina and Texas. In each of those states, Dukakis is airing
television commercials beyond his national advertising.
   In several of the states, Dukakis seems to have been helped by
lingering questions about Bush's running mate Dan Quayle. Democrats
rushed to leak poll results after the vice presidential debate that
they said showed Bush's Texas margin cut from about a dozen points
to six.
   Bush has a Rocky Mountain lead, as well. Dukakis aides claim
hopes in Montana, Colorado, New Mexico and the Dakotas, but have
little or no hope in Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada and Utah.
   A Washington Post analysis of a recent 50-state poll taken with
ABC News rated only Arkansas still a tossup among the Southern and
border states. The rest were all either rated as clear advantages
to Bush or leaning his way. The situation was similar in the Rocky
Mountain West _ Colorado and Montana were the only states not
consigned to the Bush column.
   Dukakis picked a Texan as his running mate in an attempt to gain
an instant boost in the Southern polls, and explicitly drew a
parallel to John Kennedy's selection of Texan Lyndon Johnson in his
winning 1960 campaign.
   But Republicans point to changes in voting patterns since 1960,
when Kennedy and Johnson carried Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama,
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, and 1964, when Johnson
scored a landslide.
   Since then, Democratic successes in the South have been few and
far between, highlighted by 1976, when Georgian Jimmy Carter
carried most of his native region.
   The story is similar in the West, where Democats have fared even
less well than in the South in the last quarter century. Carter
failed to carry a single state west of Texas except for Hawaii even
in his winning campaign in 1976.

<TEXT>
   In his two months as attorney general, Dick
Thornburgh has disappointed a number of conservatives who feel he
has tried to get political mileage out of making what they regard
as veiled attacks on his predecessor, Edwin Meese III.
   Thornburgh denies suggestions that any of his actions have been
aimed at Meese, who the former Pennsylvania governor has known
since the early days of the Reagan administration when Meese was
White House counselor.
   ``What I have tried to do is to dampen the enthusiasm for Ed
Meese-bashing that seemed to be prevailing prior to my coming
here,'' Thornburgh said in an interview Friday. ``If anybody's
going to be bashed it ought to be me. I'm the attorney general. I
can take it.''
   Thornburgh's ethics speech earlier this month didn't mention
Meese, but annoyed several conservatives, who felt it dredged up
memories of the 14-month criminal investigation of Meese which
ended in July. The speech calls for a review of Justice Department
ethics policies.
   Independent counsel James McKay decided he wouldn't seek Meese's
indictment, but concluded Meese had probably twice violated
conflict-of-interest laws and tax laws. The probe stemmed from
Meese's official acts on behalf of longtime friend E. Robert
Wallach, a lawyer whose clients included scandal-plagued Wedtech
Corp. and a partner in a $1 billion proposed Iraqi oil pipeline.
   ``I think Thornburgh himself is doing a pretty good job as
attorney general, but there's a difference between putting your own
imprint on the department and trying to distance yourself from
previous administrations,'' said Eugene Hickok, a special assistant
in the Office of Legal Counsel under Meese and now a political
science professor at Dickinson College.
   ``What he needs to do is establish his own reputation, not say
how he is different from Ed Meese and not try to resuscitate
directly or indirectly the problems of Ed Meese.''
   Thornburgh insisted he ``wasn't referring to my predecessor at
all'' with the ethics speech. He said the springboard for it was a
recent poll showing widespread public perception of corruption in
government.
   ``We would be foolish and not serving the president
appropriately if we were to ignore'' those perceptions, the
attorney general said.
   But some conservatives have questioned Thornburgh's motives.
   ``I think that some conservatives are concerned that since
becoming attorney general Dick Thornburgh has said things which
have seemed critical, not only of his predecessor, Ed Meese, but
the president as well,'' said Gary McDowell, vice president of the
National Legal Center for the Public Interest and the former head
of the Justice Department's speech-writing unit when Meese was
attorney general.
   ``So far, this strikes some as an attorney general possibly more
sensitive to politics and his own media image than he is dedicated
to the president's principles,'' McDowell said.
   In the ethics speech, Thornburgh said a study is needed of the
question of how the relationship between the attorney general and
the president ``can be both as close as it should be and as correct
as it ought to be.'' President Reagan and Meese have worked closely
together for over two decades.
   Thornburgh's aides emphatically rejected the suggestion that the
remark targeted the Reagan-Meese relationship.
   ``Ed Meese is a friend of mine,'' said Thornburgh. ``He always
treated me well when I was governor. ... I've said time and again
that I don't propose to look back. ... It's ... necessary to look
forward to ensure that this department continues to do its job. I'm
satisfied that we're doing that.''
   Thornburgh said he will ``serve this president until the end of
this term. What I do thereafter in the federal government is up to
Vice President Bush if he is, as I expect, elected.''
   Thornburgh, however, may make a major change in one piece of the
Meese legacy, an order that gives the attorney general the power to
appoint special prosecutors to investigate members of Congress for
allegations of wrongdoing. Meese signed the order his last day in
office.
   Thornburgh has expressed little enthusiasm for the plan and the
new attorney general and his aides have discussed possibly
overturning it.
   ``An observer might conclude from a number of things the new
attorney general has done that his or his staff's preoccupation is
that of distancing the new regime from the old one,'' said Terry
Eastland, the former Justice Department spokesman who Meese fired
in May, reportedly for not defending Meese aggressively enough.
   Eastland said that while the distancing process ``is
understandable in certain respects, it also may be unwise. ...
There was much done by Meese that in my view had merit.''

   The $170.3 billion trade deficit the United
States suffered last year cost the country 5.1 million jobs in
manufacturing and associated services, according to a study
released Saturday by a labor-backed research institute.
   The Economic Policy Institute sought to determine how many jobs
would have been created if the record trade deficit had been
completely eliminated and imports and exports had been in balance.
   The report concluded that 5.1 million jobs had been lost because
trade was not in balance, with 3.1 million of those jobs in
manufacturing and the other 2 million in related industries, such
as business services.
   The study said the job losses had been spread evenly around the
country with 1.43 million in the West, 1.38 million in the Midwest;
1.29 million in the Northeast and 1.04 million in the South.
   ``These calculations make it clear that jobs in every region of
America are being destroyed and potential jobs not being created
because of our failure to close the trade deficit,'' said Jeff
Faux, president of the institute.
   But Robert Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs,
said the study failed to take into account the fact that many
workers who have lost jobs to foreign competition have found work
elsewhere.
   He said the most recent montly employment report showed there
are only 6.6 million people currently listed as unemployed. Thus,
if the trade deficit was totally eliminated, it would wipe out
virtually all joblessness in the United States, Ortner said.
   ``Saying that 5.1 million people have lost jobs because of the
trade deficit is a mindless arithmetic calculation that doesn't
have economic content,'' he said. ``Obviously, many of these people
have gone back to work.''
   But Lawrence Mishel, research director for the institute,
defended the assumptions used in the study, which was prepared for
the institute by New York University's Institute for Economic
Analysis.
   He said the results were consistent with other views of the
impact of the trade deficit, which were done for the U.S.
International Trade Commission and the congressional Office of
Technology Assessment.
   He said the Labor Department's unemployment statistics
understate the jobless figures because they do not adequately track
the number of people who have given up looking for work or who are
working at part-time jobs but would rather have full time
employment.
   Mishel said the institute's study used an input-output model to
analyze the trade data. For example, for each bushel of grain
exported, the model computes not only the requirements for farm
equipment, but also the amount of steel absorbed by the
agricultural equipment manufacturers as well as more indirect
requirements such as the iron ore and electrical power necessary to
produce the steel.
   The U.S. trade deficit is expected to decline this year by
almost $40 billion. For the first eight months of the year, the
trade deficit has been runing at an annual rate of $138 billion.
   While the institute did not attempt to calculate had many jobs
had been gained so far this year with the trade deficit declining,
the Labor Department has reported that manufacturing employment has
increased by 303,000 jobs since the beginning of the year.
   The institute's study examined the different regions of the
country to determine what jobs could be gained if the 1987 trade
deficit was totally elimianted with half of the deficit reduction
coming from a rise in exports and half of the gain coming from a
decline in imports.
   This was the regional breakdown the study gave for the benefits
from eliminating the trade deficit:
   MIDWEST: The region would gain 735,800 jobs from greater exports
and 647,300 jobs from lower imports. The biggest gains would come
in machinery and electronic products.
   NORTHEAST: The region would gain 686,600 jobs from higher
exports and 601,600 jobs from lower imports. The biggest gains
would come in machinery and electronics.
   SOUTH: The region would gain 536,100 export-related jobs and
510,200 jobs from reducing imports. The largest concentration of
jobs lost to imports was in light manufacturing, primarily textile
and apparel jobs.
   WEST: The region would gain 779,500 export-related jobs and
647,300 jobs from lower imports. Most of the jobs lost to import
compeititon were in machinery, electronics and business services.

<HEAD>Political Leaders Reach Agreement To Reform Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's two major parties have agreed
to reform the constitution, proposing to stop the court system from
letting drug traffickers go unpunished.
   Another planned change would put a special prosecutor in charge
of human rights cases, clearing the way for a comprehensive
investigation of more than 800 death squad killings in the past two
years.
   The amended constitution also would allow presidential primary
elections and end 28 years of each president being required to name
some Cabinet ministers from the opposition party.
   The agreement, disclosed Friday by Colombia's minister of
government, Cesar Gaviria, ended two years of bitter feuding
between the Liberal and Conservative parties on what changes there
should be in the constitution.
   The announcement came after President Virgilio Barco of the
Liberal Party met for eight hours with former president Julio Cesar
Turbay, director of the Liberal Party, and former president Misael
Pastrana, chief of the Conservative party, Gaviria said.
   Congress will be asked to approve the constitutional reforms
before it goes into recess Dec. 17, Gaviria said at a news
conference. The Liberal and Conservative parties make up 95 percent
of Congress.
   A bipartisan congressional committee appointed this year to
study possible reforms decided that Colombia's court system should
be patterned in some ways after the U.S. system.
   Colombia's court system now lets judges investigate cases, take
depositions, hear out of court testimony and decide on their own if
a suspect should be charged or set free.
   It is common knowledge that some judges are bribed. No major
drug trafficker has ever been convicted of drug trafficking and
spent more than a few weeks in jail.
   Federal prosecutors now play a very small role in Colombia.
Criminal charges are made by individuals, and a chief judge assigns
investigations to other judges. Under the new system, a federal
prosecutor would decide who would be charged and would take over
the investigatory duties.
   The constitutional reform committee also envisions a special
prosecutor for human rights cases. Each of the death squad cases
now is investigated by a different judge, eliminating the
possibility of a major federal investigation linking any of the
cases.
   There have been only 12 convictions in death squad cases.
   The minister of government said Friday that the constitutional
reforms would allow Congress to force a Cabinet minister to resign.
   Congress now has little power. Constitutional reform would allow
it to censure a Cabinet minister on a vote of confidence.
   Another major change in Colombian politics would be the end of
the National Front, a sharing of power between the Liberal and
Conservative parties. The National Front was created 28 years ago
to end a war between the Liberal and Conservative parties that took
more than 250,000 lives.
   The two parties decided then to alternate the presidency every
four years, with no president being able to succeed himself. Under
the agreement, each president has had to work with Cabinet
ministers from the opposition party.
   The two party leaders also agreed the constitition should allow
each party to decide before each presidential election if there
should be a primary election, Gaviria said.

   Four sheriff's department divers were
caught snatching lobsters from a commercial fishing bed and face
misdemeanor counts of game law violations, authorities said.
   ``Lobsters really bring out the larceny in everybody,'' said
state Fish and Game Department Warden Mike Castleton, who spotted
the divers' boat early Friday anchored off La Jolla Shores.
   ``Everybody thinks of the deluxe lobster dinner. It's just
crazy,'' Castleton said.
   The men are part of an elite diving rescue and
evidence-gathering team, said San Diego County Sheriff's Lt. Alan
Fulmer. They were cited for 13 misdemeanor counts and could face
six months in jail on each count and be fined up to $1,000. They
also could face disciplinary action by the department.
   The divers were on duty at the time and had used county
equipment, including an inflatable boat, trailer and pickup, Fulmer
said. Inside their boat, authorities found 13 undersized lobsters.
   ``What they did was stupid,'' he said. ``They did get caught and
what can you say when you get caught with your hand in the cookie
jar?''

<HEAD>Court Removes Judge From Bhopal Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BHOPAL, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appellate court removed the judge in
India's $3 billion civil suit against Union Carbide Corp. for the
Bhopal chemical disaster in a ruling widely seen as a major victory
for the U.S. company.
   Judge S.K. Seth of the Madhya Pradesh state appellate court
ruled Thursday that it was ``most disturbing'' that Bhopal District
Judge M.W. Deo ordered partial compensation for families of Bhopal
victims before completing the trial.
   Deo refused to comment Saturday on the ruling.
   The Danbury, Conn.-based company had requested Deo's removal
after the judge last year awarded $270 million as interim relief to
families of more than 3,100 people who died in the 1984 leak at a
pesticide plant owned by the Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary.
   ``We haven't seen the judge's order yet, so we can't comment,''
Ed Van Den Ameele, a Carbide spokesman in Danbury, said Saturday.
   More than 20,000 were injured in the world's worst chemical
disaster.
   The award was reduced in April this year to $192 million after
Union Carbide appealed the ruling, saying the court had no power to
order it to pay interim relief until responsibility for the gas
leakage is determined.
   The government filed suit against Union Carbide claiming the
disastrous gas leak at a pesticide factory Dec. 3, 1984, was caused
by negligence. Carbide maintains the leakage of poisonous methyl
isocyanate gas was due to sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   Shambhu Singh will succeed Deo, a senior state government
official said Saturday on condition of anonymity.
   It was not immediately known if the removal of Deo will affect
the award of interim relief.
   The 2-year-old case is the world's largest-ever civil suit.

<HEAD>Mystery Haunts Show of Historic US Painter</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mystery haunts the biggest show ever mounted
of the work of Raphaelle Peale, America's great still-life painter.
   What perplexes art historians is how Peale, who was born in
1774, learned to paint fruit, cheese and steak like the Dutch
masters of a century or more earlier.
   There is no evidence that Peale ever saw Dutch paintings, but
his work bears an uncanny similarity to them, albeit with an
additional glow and color.
   ``It's a puzzle,'' said Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr., curator of
American art at the National Gallery of Art where the Peale show
opens Sunday.
   Linda Bantel, director of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts,
said there were no museums in Peale's native Philadelphia during
his youth.
   Peale's father _ Charles Willson Peale, famous for portraits of
George Washington _ founded the first museum there in 1794. She
said she has no record of early Pennsylvania museums or private
collections containing any Dutch paintings.
   The elder Peale was his son's only teacher. Charles Peale
travelled in Europe, as Raphaelle never did, and painted occasional
still lifes.
   Charles Willson Peale married three times and had 17 children,
including Rembrandt Peale who inherited his father's gift for
portraits, Rubens Peale and two Titian Peales, one of whom died
young.
   All were named for famous painters, as was Raphaelle, whose
namesake is spelled Raphael. A daughter was called Angelica
Kauffmann Peale after a Swiss portraitist.
   The younger Peale generation was encouraged to do portraits. In
the days before photography, a good likeness could earn a painter
$100. Raphaelle sold some of his still lifes for $15 and accepted
services like carpenter's work in exchange for others.
   Last December a small painting by Raphaelle Peale sold at an art
auction in New York for a record $495,000.
   But there was little prestige to painting still lifes in
Raphaelle Peale's time.
   ``A tame, insipid, smooth, flat, mindless imitation of carrots _
good God, is this the end of art, is this the use of painting?''
asked Robert Haydon, an English painter.
   Peale was a disappointment to his family. He married a woman of
whom his father disapproved, fathered six children, drank and
disappeared for long periods, leaving his family in poverty. During
one period, he appeared to earn more from writing comic verse than
from painting.
   The show will remain in the nation's capital until Jan. 29. Then
it travels to Philadelphia, where it will be seen at the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from Feb. 16 through April 16.

<HEAD>Goldwater: Dukakis, Bush Should Talk About Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former presidential candidate Barry Goldwater
says George Bush may have ``impugned the patriotism of Michael
Dukakis'' in a campaign he says has been so negative that ``as an
American citizen, I'm dammned concerned about where we're going.''
   He urged both Bush and Dukakis to ``quit calling each other
names'' and concentrate on important issues, such as how they would
handle the nation's huge debt and federal budget deficits.
   In an interview, Goldwater, who retired two years ago as
Arizona's senior Republican senator, said also he believes Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, has stronger qualifications to become
president than does Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
   But Goldwater also said of Bush: ``I don't think I've known a
man in my life who comes to the chance of being president who is
better qualified.''
   He believes Bush will ``win rather big,'' carrying half or more
of the 50 states, and added: ``I think I know generally what George
Bush stands for. I'm very much for him. I think he'll make a good
president.''
   While Goldwater said he was surprised by the choice of Quayle,
he is ``very prejudiced'' in the 41-year-old senator's favor
because he has known him and his family for years and thought
Quayle did a ``superb'' job in handling a Senate Armed Services
panel on military procurement.
   Goldwater admitted that despite his closeness to Quayle, the
question of whether the Hoosier senator is equipped to be
president, should he ever be called on to do so, is an obvious one.
   He said it is an impossible question to answer and raised the
possibility that, like Harry Truman, Quayle might grow with the
job, should it become necessary.
   ``I'll admit this,'' Goldwater volunteered. ``The man running
for vice president on the Democrat ticket is, I think, a little
better equipped.''
   ``I've known him longer,'' Goldwater said of Bentsen. ``He's
been in the Senate longer. And he's bound to have picked up many
things that Quayle hasn't had a chance to pick up.''
   Goldwater, 79, said he is ready to return to Phoenix, having
just sold the Washington apartment he occupied for decades. He is
publicizing his new autobiography, ``Goldwater,'' a tartly worded
view of his life and the personalities with whom he has worked and
clashed in a career which spanned four decades.
   Goldwater, who was subjected to harshly negative campaign
advertisements during his 1964 presidential campaign against Lyndon
Johnson, made no secret of his distaste for the 1988 campaign.
   ``I don't like the campaign, from what I've seen of it and heard
of it,'' Goldwater said. ``I don't think that either man has been
talking about the issues.''
   He said this and the negative tone of the campaign has resulted
in widespread apathy, which he said may result for the first time
in history of a turn out of less than 50 percent of the nation's
registered voters.
   In last week's debate, Bush said Goldwater couldn't know what
the issues are because the press has not been reporting on them.
Goldwater had asked Quayle to ``tell George Bush to start talking
about the issues.''
   ``George took after me, asking how I could know what was going
on when I was living way out in Arizona,'' Goldwater said and
added: ``You'd be surprised at what we know out there.''
   Responding to questions, Goldwater refered to both Bush and
Dukakis and said: ``I think the whole camaign has been negative.''
   ``They both denied that, saying they had put out position
papers,'' he said. ``Nobody reads position papers.''
   `I've been giving both candidates a bad time for this negative
campaiging at a very, very important time in our history....As an
American citizen I'm just damned concerned about where we're
going.''
   Goldwater was asked about Bush's attack on Dukakis for the
governor's veto of legislation requiring all Massachusetts school
children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Calling the pledge a ``very big part of Americana,'' Goldwater
added: ``I don't think it deserved spending more than one or two
lectures on.''
   Then, referring to other aspects of the Bush attack, Goldwater
said the GOP candidate ``talked about the dirt in the harbors in
Massachusetts, the fact that Dukakis has given leave to convicted
murderers.''
   ``That's not going to bother the guy out in Timbuktu,'' he said.
``That guy wants to know how the hell are we going to get out of
debt.''
   He said he was not able to respond with certainty to the
question of whether Bush has impugned the integrity of Michael
Dukakis.
   But after a pause, he added: ``I have a hunch that he probably
has.''
   What does that say about the shape of American presidential
politics?
   ``Bad shape,'' Goldwater replied. ``It doesn't speak well for
the political system. The American people do not like negative
advertising or negative campaigning. They'd like to be told what's
on these fellows' minds about how to get the country in order.''

<TEXT>
   Time is running short for Michael Dukakis,
and the Democratic presidential nominee still is searching for a
message that will attract voters in his faltering battle against
Republican George Bush.
   With just over three weeks left until Election Day, Dukakis was
trailing in the polls and Bush appeared to have gained ground in
the final pesidential campaign debate.
   ``One of the things I have to do, obviously, is give people a
better sense of who Mike Dukakis is,'' the candidate told reporters
on his campaign plane Friday.
   It seemed a remarkable admission from a politician who has been
campaigning for president for the past 18 months.
   ``I'm expecting to win,'' he said. ``But I think it's going to
be very tight and I've always felt that way.''
   There were large signs and small that the campaign was
feverishly looking for a way to turn the tide.
   One bit of advice came right after the Thursday debate, an
encounter that was clearly a disappointment to the Democratic
campaign.
   Dukakis' vice presidential running mate Lloyd Bentsen called and
gave him a pep talk.
   The Texas senator advised the presidential nominee that it was
time to get out and campaign ``flat out'' until Election Day.
   Bentsen has emerged as the Dukakis campaign's greatest asset
with a large majority of voters saying they prefer him to GOP vice
presidential nominee Dan Quayle.
   Jibes at Quayle remain standard parts of Dukakis and Bentsen
campaign speeches.
   The value Dukakis places on Bentsen was seen by the fact that
right after the debate, the Texas senator flew to California for a
joint appearance with the Massachusetts governor.
   The first signs of change in campaign approach were a new pair
of commercials that were very different stylistically from the
often sharp-edged ads he had run before.
   Aides also said every opportunity would be used to get the
candidate before large television audiences. He is ready and eager,
for example, to appear on such programs as ABC's ``Nightline.''
   ``Our best messenger is our candidate,'' said deputy campaign
chairman John Sasso.
   Aides also predicted a far more intense campaign schedule and on
Friday, the day after the debate, Dukakis was on the road from
eight in the morning to well past midnight.
   Aides still maintained they had a clear view of the path to
victory on Nov. 8.
   They talked of the strong grass-roots organization built up over
months and contended the debate had exposed ``several new areas of
vulnerability and weakness'' in Bush.
   And they could point to the crowd of nearly 10,000 that waited
in the rain in Seattle to hear Dukakis on Friday.
   ``We are poised for a strong last three weeks,'' Sasso told a
post-debate briefing.
   ``The road ahead of us is going to be tough,'' conceded the
candidate.
   Advisers admitted that Bush commercials attacking Dukakis for
his state's program granting prison furloughs and for the pollution
in Boston Harbor had put the Democratic nominee on the defensive.
   ``The furlough thing has really hurt,'' said Steve Engelberg, a
political adviser traveling with Dukakis. ``To win we have to get
rid of it and rid of it fast.''
   Dukakis tried to do just that by pointing out that his father
had once been beaten and robbed and that his brother had been
killed by a hit-and-run driver.
   ``I don't need George Bush to tell me about crime,'' he told
audiences.
   The Massachusetts governor also cited the federal furlough
program and specifically the case of a furloughed drug dealer who
raped and murdered a pregnant woman in Arizona.
   Equally damaging was the Boston Harbor commercial run by Bush.
It showed scenes of sludge and dead fish and said Dukakis had
failed to act promptly to clean up the harbor.
   Campaign aides conceded that commercial put Dukakis on the
defensive on the environment, particularly in California, where the
environment was regarded as Dukakis' strongest issue.
   California campaign aides think a Dukakis response commercial
citing Reagan administration cuts in environmental protection
programs has now neutralized the Boston Harbor ad.
   The new national Dukakis commercials are desigmed to deal with a
perception that he is cold, passionless. In them, Dukakis speaks in
a conversational tone and tries to get across his values.
   In one, Dukakis is in shirtsleeves and sitting on a couch.
   ``It's been a few years since Kitty and I had children in
school,'' he says.
   Then after referring to challenges facing young couples today,
he concludes, ``I'd want my president to be in touch with the
things that are important to me and my family.''

<HEAD>Under Stringent Controls, Ferrets Head for New Breeding Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to preserve the survival of a
species, six of the nearly extinct black-footed ferret will travel
Tuesday under strict sanitary controls to a pre-screened zoo for a
new captive breeding program.
   The tiny, weasel-like animals were among 34 kits born this
spring at the Wyoming Game and Fish department's Sybille Canyon
captive breeding facility. The 58 there are thought to be the only
black-footed ferrets in the world.
   ``The ferrets are doing real well, and we are at a situation now
where we feel we have enough ferrets that we can split the Sybille
colony,'' said Art Reese, chief of habitat and technical services
at the game department.
   The ferrets were nearly wiped out in late 1985 when an epidemic
of canine distemper ran through their last known colony near
Meeteetse. Biologists managed to save only 18 of the rare animals.
   As a result, officials had to be sure that the plane chosen to
fly the six kits had not carried a cat or dog for at least several
months, Reese said in an interview Friday.
   There also will be a 15-foot buffer zone around the ferrets on
the Wyoming Air National Guard plane where no one will be allowed
to enter, he said.
   Some 17 zoos around the country answered the game department's
call for captive breeding proposals, Reese said, but just three met
stringent conditions the department imposed, which includes that
the kits can't be put on display to visitors for fear of exposure
to disease.
   ``The overriding purpose (of sending the animals to other zoos)
is captive breeding,'' he said. ``Ferrets are susceptible to
disease and stress, and we didn't want to take that risk.''
   Following a tour of the zoos, the department selected Henry
Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb., and the National Zoo, just outside
Washington, D.C., in Front Royal, Va. The first six kits are flying
to Washington on Tuesday, and another eight will go to Nebraska
next month.
   ``We only had enough young to go to two,'' Reese said, so the
department's third choice, the Minnesota Zoo in Minneapolis, was
turned down.
   To win the ferrets, the zoos had to agree not to do research on
them without approval of both the Wyoming game department and the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and to fund the breeding program,
Reese said.
   When the next set of ferrets is taken to Omaha next month, they
likely will ride in a van specially conditioned and disinfected for
the purpose.
   The precautions are in keeping with a stringent disease control
system at Sybille, Reese said.
   Anyone going in to see the animals at the facility must first
shower and put on protective gear similar to a hospital isolation
unit, he said.
   ``It's worse than the Mayo Clinic, I think. That's because you
have all your eggs in one basket,'' Reese said. ``If disease did
hit, you could face extinction of the whole species.''
   Biologists are confident that spreading the population out to
the other two sites will put the department closer to its goal of
reintroducing the ferrets in the wild by fiscal year 1991.

<HEAD>Water Experts Gamble Reservoirs Levels On A Payback From Heavy
Snow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM GARDNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water experts in this gambling state have
staked their savings on what is at best an even-odds bet for a wet
winter, draining most of western Nevada's drought-depleted
reservoirs to keep faucets flowing this fall.
   ``We'll get through this year. But we're going to go into next
year with basically everything empty,'' said Bob Firth, water
resources manager for Westpac Utilities.
   The principal reservoir for the Reno area is Lake Tahoe, the
scenic resort destination for tourists astride the
Nevada-California border.
   Its boat docks were on dry land early this summer, and Thursday
its feeble flow to Reno went dry altogether when its level dropped
below the spillways for the first time in 11 years.
   Anticipating the loss of Tahoe's overflow, Westpac Utilities has
been tapping Donner Lake, just across the state line in California,
and is pumping as much groundwater as the state will allow to
supply its 50,900 customers around Reno.
   The Reno area is in a stage-three drought alert, but more strict
limits are possible if the winter proves to be dry once again.
Already, lawn watering is limited to one day a week, hosing off
sidewalks, patios and driveways is prohibited and construction
companies can't use water from hydrants for dust control.
Restaurant patrons have to ask for a glass of water.
   The winter snowpack in the Sierra Nevada range, which provides
the summertime water for western Nevada through runoff into the
Truckee and Carson rivers, has been about half of normal the past
two years.
   Firth and other members of Gov. Richard Bryan's 8-month-old
drought committee agree that above-average snowfall in the Sierra
Nevada is needed to relieve the drought and begin refilling the
reservoirs.
   There's scientific evidence, Firth says, that the last drought
lasting as much as three consecutive years in western Nevada was
around 1590.
   But Bob Thompson, Nevada area manager for the National Weather
Service, sets the chances for an above-average water year at only
50-50.
   Along with precipitation of just 3.95 inches since Oct. 1, 1987,
compared with the normal 7.5 inches, the past summer was the
warmest in the 118 years that records have been kept in Reno,
according to John James, state climatologist.
   ``We got clobbered three ways,'' he said. ``A lack of water,
high temperatures and the highest evaporation rates we've seen.
That just wiped us out.''
   Drought committee members agree it would take winter storms
around 150 percent of average to restore the diminished reservoirs.
   But even with a stormy winter, ``We're going to have a lot of
holes to fill,'' Firth said.
   A snowfall that's just 90 percent of normal would allow Westpac
Utilities to meet the Reno area's annual 21-billion-gallon thirst
with some conservation, Firth said.
   But Federal Watermaster Garry Stone said nearly three times that
amount would be needed to meet the water needs of both the homes,
hotel-casinos and businesses around Reno and the irrigation demands
of golf courses and farmers and ranchers.
   This year's agricultural losses are estimated at $10 million to
$15 million by University of Nevada-Reno economists.
   Joe Ely, chairman of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Indians, said his
tribe's ancestral lake has fallen more than two feet this year. The
lake downstream from Reno retained enough water for a successful
summer of boating and fishing, but the flow from the Truckee River
was too low to allow the endangered cui-ui fish and the threatened
Lahontan trout to spawn, Ely said.
   Sixty miles east of Reno, irrigation of alfalfa and cantaloupe
fields near Fallon has left Lake Lahontan with about 12,600 acre
feet of water in its 314,000-acre-foot basin.
   Lahontan irrigation water was cut off in mid-September, but one
more small release is planned late this month for winter crops,
leaving less than 10,000 acre-feet in reserve for next year.
   Of the other reservoirs that serve western Nevada and the
Sierra, the only usable supplies are at Donner Lake and at Boca
Reservoir, also in California, where Westpac Utilities is saving
11,500 acre-feet of water, 28 percent of its capacity.
   ``There isn't a lot of storage left as reservoirs go,'' said
Chris Pacheco, water supply specialist with the state office of the
U.S. Soil Conservation Service.

   Portugal wants to help rebuild the
war-shattered economies of its former southern African colonies of
Angola and Mozambique, the foreign minister told South African
leaders on Saturday.
   Portugal also is ready to participate in bringing independence
to South-West Africa, Foreign Minister Joao de Deus Pinheiro said.
   He gave Portugal's commitment to ``peace, democracy and
development'' in southern Africa after he and Prime Minister Anibal
Cavaco Silva talked for 90 minutes with South African President
Pieter W. Botha and Foreign Minister Roelof Botha.
   Roelof Botha told reporters after the meeting that they
discussed the progress of U.S.-mediated peace talks among Angola,
Cuba and South Africa aimed at the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban
soldiers from Angola and independence for South-West Africa, or
Namibia.
   Marxist Angola has been fighting a 13-year-old guerrilla war
with South African- and U.S.-supported rebels.
   South African troops withdrew from Angola into neighboring
South-West Africa in late August as part of a cease-fire agreement
that emerged from the talks.
   Deus Pinheiro also said Portugal was ready to participate in
implementing a U.N. plan for independence elections in South-West
Africa, which South Africa has governed in violation of a U.N.
resolution.
   But he indicated it was too early to say if Portuguese troops
would take part in a U.N. peacekeeping force in South-West Africa.
   Botha said the leaders also discussed recent developments in
Pretoria's relations with Mozambique and the possibilities of
restoring power supplies to South Africa from the mainly
Portuguese-owned Cahora Bassa hydroelectric plant in northern
Mozambique.
   Power lines from the dam to South Africa are regularly sabotaged
by rebels of the Mozambique National Resistence who have been
fighting to topple the leftist Mozambican government since 1977.
   The talks on economic recontruction for southern Africa followed
a call by Deus Pinheiro for a Portuguese-administered $600 million
``mini-Marshall Plan'' for the region.

<HEAD>Nelson Mandela Is Angry At Botha, Says Wife After Visit</HEAD>

   Winnie Mandela visited her
husband, black nationalist Nelson Mandela, at his guarded hospital
room Saturday and said he was angered by President P.W. Botha's
claim that he is cooperating with the government.
   She also said speculation about his imminent release were
``sheer rumors.''
   Botha suggested last week that the jailed African National
Congress leader could be freed soon if he ``continues cooperating
with the authorities, as he is doing at present.'' Botha did not
elaborate.
   ``About the so-called cooperation with the government, Mandela
says he will answer to that himself,'' Mrs. Mandela told reporters.
``As he said that, he looked very angry.''
   Mandela, 70, is recuperating from tuberculosis at the
Constantiaberg Clinic, a modern private hospital in Cape Town. He
became ill in August, and doctors expect him to make a complete
recovery in about three months.
   Mrs. Mandela said she and her husband did not discuss the latest
wave of speculation that he may soon be freed after 26 years in
prison.
   ``All the rumors about his release are sheer rumors,'' she said.
   In addition to his wife, Mandela was visited for more than an
hour by his daughter, Zindzi, and her two children, and by his
sister, Leaby Piliso. It was the Mandelas' first reunion since
August.
   Mrs. Mandela said her husband ``looks very well, much better
than when I last saw him.''
   Botha, although refusing to be specific, has said in recent
weeks that he hopes Mandela will not have to return to Pollsmoor
Prison from the hospital. Government officials have indicated
Mandela might be freed without having to comply with Botha's
longstanding demand that he renounce violence.
   Mandela has been jailed since 1962. He received a life sentence
in 1964 for plotting an ANC sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the
white-minority government.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire said after meeting with
Botha on Oct. 1 that the South African president had promised to
release Mandela unconditionally.
   Botha refused to confirm this, but a pro-government newspaper,
The Citizen, later quoted officials as saying Mandela could be
released at any time starting in mid-November.
   Mandela is the most popular leader among South Africa's
disenfranchised black majority. Government officials worry that his
release could provoke a new outbreak of black militancy and unrest,
but they also perceive that freeing Mandela could ease
international pressure on South Africa.
   In other developments:
   _An explosion early Saturday outside a police barracks in
Kathlehong, a black township near Johannesburg, caused damage but
no injuries. Police have blamed the ANC for most of the roughly 80
bombings in South Africa this year.
   _Govan Mbeki, an ANC leader freed last year after 23 years in
prison, lost a court bid Friday to overturn restrictions placed on
him after his release. The 78-year-old activist, a co-defendant of
Mandela's, had challenged the validity of the emergency regulations
under which his restrictions were imposed.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   More than 200,000 Serbs rallied
Saturday in four towns to push demands for Serbian control over two
neighboring autonomous provinces.
   The Communist Party leader of the northern republic of Slovenia
said meanwhile that the country is ``on the threshold of imposing
emergency measures'' after violent demonstrations.
   ``We have to sober up and stop this insanity,'' said leader
Milan Kucan.
   His speech at an official rally in Slovenia came during intense
politicking before a meeting of the national Communist Party's
Central Committee. The meeting, starting Monday, is expected to
shake up Yugoslavia's leadership during its worst crisis since
World War II.
   Hundreds of thousands of Serbs demonstrated in Sombor in
autonomous Vojvodina province near the Hungarian border; and in
Leskovac, 90 miles south of Belgrade in the republic of Serbia. Two
smaller demonstrations occurred in Indija in Serbia and in Stara
Pazova in Vojvodina.
   No violence was reported, but all of the protesters pledged
allegiance to Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian party chief, in what
has now become a daily phenomenon.
   Milosevic wants Serbia, one of Yugoslavia's six republics, to be
given more control over Vojvodina and another autonomous province,
Kosovo.
   Kosovo, which was once inhabited mostly by Serbs, is now
predominantly ethnic Albanian. Serbs accuse Kosovo's leadership of
discriminating against Kosovo's Serbian residents.
   Milosevic's push has alarmed non-Serb leaders and has prompted
outcries that his policies may tear Yugoslavia apart.
   In addition, students and workers have used the ethnic rallies
to push for economic and political changes, prompting Communist
authorities in the southern republic of Montenegro last weekend to
use force to disperse demonstrators.
   This month, a crowd of 30,000 in the disputed province of
Vojvodina laid siege to Communist Party headquarters, forcing the
resignation of the province's entire leadership _ an unprecedented
step in Communist Yugoslavia.
   Kucan, the Slovene leader, criticized the demonstrations and
indirectly accused the leadership of Serbia of conducting policies
that jeopardize the stability of the country.
   He said a continuation of the unrest could lead to the
introduction of emergency measures nationwide, the state news
agency Tanjug reported.
   Last week, authorities in Montenegro banned street rallies there
after pro-Serbian demonstrations escalated into anti-government
protests.
   ``We were on the threshold of emergency measures after the
recent events in Novi Sad and Titograd,'' Kucan said, referring to
the Vojvodina and Montenegro capitals where the disturbances took
place.
   ``It is no problem to get people on to the streets, fire up
their passions, but one should think of the consequences, which are
hard to forget,'' he said.
   He called for more democratic changes and freedoms as a solution
to Yugoslavia's political crisis and economic woes.
   Inflation reached 217 percent in September, and the foreign debt
stands at $21 billion. Austerity measures imposed last May to
ensure new loans have slashed wages while allowing prices to rise.
   On Friday, the government announced plans to ease the unpopular
austerity program, newspapers reported.
   Changes in the program include wage increases for workers in
profitable companies and more funding for hard-pressed social
services, such as health and education. The changes were announced
Thursday by the federal government, Belgrade's state-run dailies
said.
   But all seemed subject to approval by the International Monetary
Fund whose delegation has announced a visit to Yugoslavia next week.
   Kucan said it was understandable that Yugoslavs were unhappy.
   ``With a drastic increase of prices, and a drop in the
purchasing power, it is not hard to bring so many unhappy people on
to the streets,'' Kucan said.
   Monday's meeting is supposed to approve sweeping personnel
changes and unite the bickering Communist Party leadership on
policies to overcome the social and economic crisis.
   Pre-meeting maneuvering has opened up public rifts between the
Serbian Communist leadership and other Communist leaders around the
country.
   On Friday, Serbian Communist organizations demanded the
resignation of national party chief Stipe Suvar for accusing the
Serbian party of not doing enough to defend the legacy of the late
Josip Broz Tito, who died in May 1980 after ruling supreme for 35
years.
   Tito worked to unite the country's fractious ethnic groups.
Serbian Communist organization are being accused of moving to
splinter the country.

   Relief workers trying to stop famine
deaths in the southwest spoke Saturday of feeding refugees so
wretched they can't afford clothing and live in huts fashioned from
sticks and scrub undergrowth.
   Death from starvation is an everyday occurrence in the refugee
camps, although the toll has tapered off to 10 daily from 80 a day
in July and August, the worst months in a summer that some relief
officials say took up to 10,000 lives.
   The tiny town of Abyei, 500 miles southwest of Khartoum, has
become a gathering place for people dispossessed in a bitter civil
war that is largely ignored by the world.
   Just beyond the reach of the fighting, it also became the target
of a U.S.-financed supply mission aiming to airlift 90 tons of food
in a 10-day period that began Thursday.
   ``The people in Abyei are totally emaciated,'' said Cole Dodge,
Khartoum representative of UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund.
   ``There are old people, women and children, a few wearing
ragged, short and wide shifts, while the rest are naked. They live
in African grass-and-stick huts, huddled together,'' he said.
   Dodge said 820,000 people have fled the war into camps or other
havens in Sudan or neighboring Ethiopia. Of those, 65,000 are
receiving relief in the western regions of Darfur and southern
Kordofan, where Abyei is located.
   Twin-engine Cessna planes fly three flights daily from the arid
town because local air-charter companies have no larger cargo
planes available and Abyei's tiny airfield can hardly handle them.
   ``(Abyei) has no more than a dozen or 15 permanent structures,
including the military headquarters, the jail, the relief center
and the school,'' said Dodge, who returned to the capital Friday
from Abyei.
   Neither the Americans nor others in the project have disclosed
the cost of the supply mission, but Dodge said UNICEF will pump
$500,000 worth of goods into Abyei in the next six months.
   The Sudanese Red Crescent says Abyei's population normally is
10,000, but the refugees had swelled it to 40,000. Dodge estimated
15,000 to 20,000 live there now.
   UNICEF said food is so short on Abyei's open market that the
price of a 198-pound bag of sorghum, the Sudanese staple, has risen
from $16 to $166 in two months. The refugees, most of whom
abandoned all their belongings to find safety, cannot buy any.
   Officials of Western relief organizations, speaking on condition
of anonymity, estimated 10,000 people perished from starvation and
the lack of medical care during the summer and continue killing
about 10 people a day in the Abyei area.
   Officials estimate that twice that number in the region and
further south receive no help because weather and road conditions,
activity of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army or fighting
between the rebels and the government make it impossible to reach
them.
   The Liberation Army, fighting for economic and political reforms
since 1983, claims to control 90 percent of the southern
countryside. A key demand is autonomy for the Christian and animist
African south from the Moslem-dominated government in the north.
   The government earlier expelled several Western relief agencies
for allegedly working with the rebels in order to get supplies to
stranded southerners.
   Relief food and medicines last reached Abyei in June, before
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government halted relief operations
during the rainy season.
   Southern rebels step up their activities during the rainy
season, forcing more displaced people on the road and into camps in
places like Abyei.
   Even for those who stayed and farmed, Dodge said, record rains
flooded an area the size of Nevade and ruined their small sorghum
crops.
   Mahdi's government gave the U.S. Agency for International
Development permission to set up the Abyei relief operation after
Sudanese officials visited there last week with U.S. and U.N.
representatives.

   Rawlins, on the other hand, says his studies of Peary's notes
kept at the National Archives and Johns Hopkins University convince
him that the admiral knew exactly how far away he was and turned
back when supplies ran low and warming weather threatened to make
the floating ice too dangerous.
   Rawlins concluded that Peary was as much as 121 miles away from
the pole when he turned back.
   Rawlins' evidence comes from interpretation of Peary's
long-suppressed notes which Rawlins recently uncovered at the
archives, where Peary's papers were kept under seal for about 50
years.
   Rawlins was first made aware of the mysterious document _ a
series of astronomical observations _ when he learned that Isaiah
Bowman's file of his dealings with Peary also had been unsealed
after half a century.
   Bowman, a former president of Johns Hopkins, was a defender of
Peary, and had come into possession of a copy of Peary's secret
document in 1935. Peary's daughter, Marie, had sent to Bowman a
copy of the mysterious paper, which was kept in her mother's safe
deposit box in Portland, Maine.
   According to Bowman, Peary had instructed his wife, Jo, to
treasure the piece of paper ``as her most precious possession and
never let it out of her hands'' unless it was to silence critics.
Peary died in 1920.
   After he saw Bowman's copy and other notes, Rawlins located the
original Peary document at the National Archives and deciphered it.
   Peary's grandson, Stafford, disputes Rawlins calculations.
   ``I have a study done by two mathemeticians of the Coast and
Geodetic Survey in 1911. They took the observations he made at
pole, and came up with the conclusion he was within 1.6 miles,''
said Stafford.
   And, he added, ``a gentleman named Heber Curtis, in the 1939
edition of Naval Institute Proceedings, analyzed the admiral's
observations at the pole ... and found it made within 100 feet.''
   ``All I can say is ... all his observations have been studied to
death. The Naval Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives
studied it in minute detail and both the minority and majority
decision said yes, he had been there,'' Stafford said.
   ``There are various ways of calculation that have been made that
have cast doubt on his effort. ... But their validity is
conjectural,'' said the Smithsonian's Lundeberg. ``When we are
trying to establish the arrival of an explorer at an ice floe, at a
geographic location, there's nothing that can be left there
permanently, as a record.''
   Capt. Robert Bartlett was the last man to turn back before the
final rush to the pole, Stafford said, but before leaving he
checked his location and calculated that he was 133 miles from the
pole. After that Peary went on for five more days, Stafford said.
Could he still have been 121 miles away from his goal? Stafford
asked.
   That was a time when explorers depended on the sun and stars for
navigation and on their wits and guts for survival, he said. If you
got into a problem, you didn't pick up a mike and call Houston for
help.

<HEAD>Reagan Takes Credit for Budget Harmony</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New grafs 11-12 with Democratic response from Eckart</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, in one of his most partisan
radio addresses in months, today accused the Democratic majority in
Congress of being budget profligates who seek to elect a
``tax-and-spend'' president.
   And Reagan took credit for the fact that the deficit for the
fiscal 1989 federal budget is projected to be below $146 billion.
If the deficit exceeded that figure, the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget act requires automatic across-the-board cuts.
   ``Left to its own devices, Congress would not have done this,''
Reagan said.
   The Office of Management and Budget informed Congress on Friday
that its final projection of the fiscal 1989 federal deficit was
just under the $146 billion Gramm-Rudman target. If the projection
had exceeded that figure, defense and domestic spending would have
been cut by at least $10 billion.
   Instead of praising the bipartisan agreement that paved the way
for the accord, Reagan offered a back-handed slap at the outgoing,
Democratic-run Congress and Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis.
   ``I'm sorry to say that the Congress' liberal leadership has one
answer to everything _ and that's raise your taxes. And if they
stay in control of the Congress, they may just find a way to raise
them,'' Reagan warned.
   Without mentioning either presidential candidate by name, Reagan
touted Vice President George Bush's anti-tax stand.
   ``Why should we have a president who says, `no more taxes' and
Congress have a liberal leadership that wants to tax and spend? ...
If we don't want a tax-and-spend liberal in the White House,
shouldn't we give the president a Congress that will work with
him?'' Reagan said.
   He did note that Congress had passed all its spending bills on
time this year, instead of bundling them into a huge, emergency
piece of legislation.
   ``Congress heard my warning that if that happened again, I'd use
my veto pen ... ,'' Reagan said. ``So we stopped Congress from
saying once more `the dog ate my homework' when its budget
assignment was due.''
   In the Democratic response, Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, sharply
attacked Bush, the GOP presidential nominee.
   ``George Bush has been a silent partner, riddled with
corruption, corruption that has reached into the President's
cabinet, to the Pentagon, from defense contractors to Wall Street.
And yet, it was a Democratic Congress this week that spoke of the
shared vision with the American people and Mike Dukakis in passing
a tough ethics bill that covered ourselves and those who tried to
profit from their connections,'' Eckart said.
   Even a cut of $10 billion would make only a small dent in the
overall $1.1 trillion federal deficit. Leaders of both parties have
sought to avoid triggering the mandatory cuts of the Gramm-Rudman
bill, which could offend many interest groups.
   ``Lots of people were disposed to avoid that,'' said Sen. Lawton
Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   OMB's final projection for the 1989 fiscal year deficit is just
under $145.5 billion. The fiscal year began Oct. 1.
   If there had been $545 million more in federal spending, the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law would have required government
expenditures to be cut by whatever amount would have reduced the
deficit to $136 billion.
   Because of delays in completing anti-drug legislation and other
bills, Congress will continue working next week, rather than
adjourning for the year Friday as planned.
   That means that Congress could pass additional spending bills
for fiscal 1989 that would add to the deficit. But under the
Gramm-Rudman law, spending enacted after Oct. 15 _ which is two
weeks into the fiscal year _ is not calculated, and there are no
legal consequences to adding to the deficit after that date.
   However, there would be political consequences.
   OMB Director James C. Miller III _ who leaves office today _
wrote in his resignation letter that he was urging Reagan to veto
any spending measure that would push the deficit beyond $146
billion, even though it would no longer set off automatic cuts.
   ``I urge you to maintain a commitment to deficit reduction
during the final days of this Congress,'' Miller told congressional
leaders.
   Some lawmakers and aides have said Congress might pass
legislation next week _ or next year _ to pay for new programs
created by the drug bill.
   Congressional leaders and administration officials worked
closely all year in an effort to ensure a tranquil budget process
that sidestepped the oft-repeated crises of previous years.
   Last November, following the stock market crash, Reagan and
congressional leaders reached a budget pact that set spending
limits for this year. That agreement, though not legally binding,
was largely adhered to and eased this year's budget work immensely.
   In an achievement unmatched since 1976, Congress completed all
13 appropriations bills needed to finance the government before
fiscal 1989 began. The last bill passed at 11:57 p.m. on Sept. 30 _
three minutes before the end of fiscal 1988.
   The Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday projected the 1989
deficit at $151.8 billion, well above the $146 billion deficit
target.
   But Congress changed the Gramm-Rudman law last year, making the
CBO projection only advisory. In years past, such different
projections by the congressional and administration budget agencies
would have provoked bitter disputes that likely would have lasted
for months.

   President Ronald Reagan's weekly address.
   Last month, I had an unusual phone call from Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen. He asked me to play Dan Quayle and help him prepare for
the vice-presidential debate. I eagerly accepted. I thought it
would be fun.
   However, as I began to study up on Sen. Quayle, I realized that
I was studying a controversial man -- a man who did not share the
lives, the needs, and the hopes of many of my constituents in
northeastern Ohio, a man who took every shortcut available, who
never struggled to make ends meet, to make college costs, or to pay
his rent.
   I had to wonder what it was about Dan Quayle that George Bush
liked. I realized there have been a lot of those folks in George
Bush's career -- Robert Bork, Rita Lavelle, James Watt, and Ed
Meese -- and never once did George Bush question their judgment or
their ability to serve. It's no wonder he picked a guy like Dan
Quayle.
   We're now 24 days from a watershed presidential election, a
decision that will take America into the 1990s. And on Thursday,
millions of Americans sat in their living rooms and looked for the
next leader of the free world, because leadership is what the
election is all about -- leaders that believe in the shared values
of the American people and are willing to work with the Congress,
not engage in needless confrontation, the kinds of confrontation
that has resulted in the Democratic Congress overturning a dozen
presidential vetoes on issues like trade, clean water, civil
rights, and job creation.
   Thursday night was the candidacy of the status quo versus the
candidacy of ``we can do better.'' My congressional district in
northeastern Ohio holds to many traditional values -- hard work,
strong moral and religious beliefs, pride in their heritage, and
the accomplishments of their children. But they know that it's been
the Democrats who have worked hard to save their jobs, that it was
George Bush and Dan Quayle who opposed plant-closing and tough
trade laws, but that it was Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen who led the
fight to put America first.
   George Bush has been a silent partner, riddled with corruption,
corruption that has reached into the President's cabinet, to the
Pentagon, from defense contractors to Wall Street. And yet, it was
a Democratic Congress this week that spoke of the shared vision
with the American people and Mike Dukakis in passing a tough ethics
bill that covered ourselves and those who tried to profit from
their connections.
   It was George Bush who called himself an environmentalist, who
wanted to sic the FBI on those who polluted our beaches. But, it
was the Democratic Congress, sharing Mike Dukakis's belief that we
have to end this indiscriminate dumping and pass legislation to end
those who will pollute our beaches with medical waste, and thus,
return the beaches to our children so they can enjoy them.
   It was once again the Democratic Congress that passed sweeping
welfare reform legislation called for by Mike Dukakis in his role
as Massachusetts' Governor. We responded with an appropriate bill
to help take people off of welfare and put them back on productive
payrolls.
   I've watched this campaign closely, not only through my eyes,
but through the eyes of my eight-and-a-half year old son, Eddie,
who's asked me often, ``Dad, what's this all about?'' I've told him
that it's about leadership and shared values, an America that looks
to a new generation of leadership that is both dynamic and just,
leaders who have a sense of compassion, but a commitment to
individual initiative, leaders who can inspire, but are inspired by
our history in a sense that our greatness really is in the future.
   I told Eddie it's a challenge that lies before us. It does not
rest with those who are unwilling to risk something of themselves.
Nor does it rest with those who demand that the struggle be easily
won. It does rest with those who are ready and willing to trade the
comfort and the convenience of the critic for the sweat and the
sacrifice of the committed, and it rests with those of us who have
a hope and a vision for a better America and a better world, and
among all of us who believe that the best of America is yet to
come. Thank you, God bless you, and have a good day.

<HEAD>Vatican in the Red By Nearly $64 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican was in the red by nearly $64
million last year, its second-largest deficit ever, according to a
financial statement issued Saturday by the Holy See.
   Church officials who released the document appealed to Roman
Catholics to contribute more so that the Vatican could ``adequately
carry out its pastoral mission.''
   It was the ninth year in a row that the administrative center
for the world's 850 million Catholics has operated at a loss.
   The deficit will be covered by $50 million from ``Peter's
Pence,'' the annual offering from Catholics to the pope, and the
rest by reserve funds, a news release said.
   The Vatican said its 1987 deficit was 74.6 billion Italian lire,
down from a record 76.6 billion a year earlier. Using the 1987
end-of-year exchange rate, the church said the 1987 figure equalled
$63.8 million.
   The Holy See said it expects its 1988 shortfall to be its
largest ever _ climbing 3 percent above the 1987 figure _ even
though it slapped strict controls on spending and has urged more
contributions.
   The news release said covering the 1988 deficit would be
``precarious'' because reserve funds had been used to pay 1987
expenses.
   The budget statement was issued by the 12-member Council of
Cardinals for the Study of the Organization and Economic Problems
of the Holy See at the conclusion of three days of meetings.
   Members of the Council and the Vatican spokesman were not in
their offices or residences Saturday to answer telephone calls.
   The budget covers expenses for the curia, or the church's
central administration, Vatican radio, diplomatic missions and the
Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano.
   The largest 1987 expense was salaries for the Vatican's 2,325
employees and pension payments to its 880 retirees, which combined
to make up 54 percent of the budget, compared to 51 percent in
1986. The financial statement said the increase was due to a
reorganization of personnel and salary raises.
   The budget does not include the Vatican bank or the costs of
Pope John Paul II's travels, which the Vatican says are paid for by
local churches.
   The Vatican's biggest source of income came from investments
such as bank accounts, stocks and bonds and property, which paid
$38.1 million, an increase of nearly 7 percent from a year earlier,
according to the statement.
   While ``Peter's Pence'' is considered papal rather than Vatican
income, the Vatican news release noted contributions to the fund
for the first nine months of this year had reached $36.8 million _
an increase of 2.9 percent over the same period in 1987.
   The council includes two cardinals from the United States: John
O'Connor of New York and retired Archbishop John Krol of
Philadelphia. The United States and West Germany are considered
major sources for contributions.
   The Vatican began making its financial details public in 1979 at
the urging of Pope John Paul II. At that time, its deficit was $20
million. This year marked only the second time the church gave
breakdowns for expenses and income.
   According to the Vatican statement, the church spent $132.7
million in 1987 and took in $68.9 million for a deficit of $63.8
million.
   While the 1987 deficit is the second-largest on Vatican ledgers,
it actually works out to the largest ever in dollars because of
swings in the exchange rate.
   Because the rate used in the Vatican calculations was one of the
lower ones for 1987, the extent of the deficit is magnified in
dollars.

   With a little help from her mother,
2{-year-old Jessica McClure unveiled a bronze plaque Saturday
commemorating her rescue one year ago after 58 hours trapped in an
abandoned well.
   Jessica squealed with delight and squirmed in her mother's arms
while about 150 people crowded in to see the plaque, which shows
the smiling, dusty faces of rescue workers when they pulled the
bandaged child up a rescue shaft.
   ``Chip and I are still thanking the Lord for getting us our
beautiful baby back,'' Cissy McClure said at the ceremony. ``This
rescue meant a lot to us.''
   Mayor Carroll Thomas praised the spirit of the volunteer
rescuers, many of whom came from cities outside Midland to help.
   ``Those people responded marvelously, on the spur of the moment,
and they came as fast as they could,'' Thomas said.
   The plaque, designed by Midland artist Mary Griffith, reads:
``Nothing the heart gives away is gone. It is kept in the hearts of
others.''
   Thomas announced the creation of an annual award to be given by
Midland to another U.S. city which shows community spirit akin to
that displayed in Midland during Jessica's ordeal. The first such
award will be given next year on the second anniversary of
Jessica's rescue.
   Jessica fell into the 8-inch-wide abandoned water well in her
aunt's back yard on Oct. 14, 1987, and captured the world's
attention when she cried for her mother and softly sang nursery
rhymes until her rescue in front of live television cameras.
   Volunteers drilled a shaft parallel to the well, their progress
made agonizingly slow because the hard rock dulled even
diamond-tipped drill bits. After two days of drilling, they made a
horizontal shaft just under Jessica and plucked her out Oct. 16.
   Midland firefighters and paramedics had joined with oil drilling
engineers and roughnecks for the painstaking effort.
   The plaque is intended to thank them and the oilfield service
companies that provided equipment used by the volunteers. Jim and
Joy Cook of Corpus Christi provided funds for the 4-by-6-foot bas
relief on the side of a community center in downtown Midland.
   During her ordeal, Jessica was wedged in the shaft in such a
position that blood flow to her right foot was impaired and she
lost a small patch of skin from her forehead.
   Jessica lost her right little toe and part of her big toe and
skin had to be stretched over the forehead wound, but after
spending more than a month in the hospital her doctors say she
apparently hasn't suffered any other adverse physical or
psychological effects.
   In an interview published in Sunday's editions of the Odessa
American, Jessica's 19-year-old parents said their daughter is
normal with no memory of the tumble that made world headlines.
   ``I don't think she realizes she's any different,'' Mrs. McClure
said. ``She knows she's Jessica and she's the little girl that fell
in the well, but that doesn't mean anything to her.''
   After a squabble over rights to the story between two factions
of people who were involved in the rescue, a Los Angeles production
company is drafting a script for a television movie about Jessica's
saga.
   The toddler has a trust fund at a local bank that will be used
for future medical bills and will be turned over to her when she
becomes 26.
   In December 1987, the Midland City Council passed an ordinance
requiring that abandoned wells be covered.

   More than 2,000 people
demonstrated in downtown Frankfurt on Saturday to protest a planned
right-wing politcal rally, one of three large rallies in West
Germany, police said.
   Near Wackersdorf, about 180 miles southeast of Frankfurt, more
than 15,000 protesters rallied against construction of a nuclear
waste treatment facility there, police said. No violence was
reported.
   About 3,500 peace activists protested near the village of
Linnich to protest the construction of a NATO command bunker there,
police said. Linnich is near the Dutch border.
   Police said there were no reports of violence in the Frankfurt
rally, but that six people were detained after they were found
carrying knifes, truncheons and tear gas.
   The Frankfurt demonstration was called to protest a planned
march by members of the right-wing National Democratic Party of
Germany.
   Party officials called off the march on Friday, despite a
favorable court ruling allowing them to assemble. Frankfurt
officials initially sought to block the march, saying that it would
likely cause violence.
   National Democratic Party officials said they called off the
march because the party did not want to be blamed for any violent
incidents ``caused exclusively by left-wing crazies.''

<HEAD>Reagan Warns Against a `Tax and Spend' President</HEAD>

   President Reagan attacked Democrat Michael
Duakakis on Saturday as a ``tax-and-spend'' presidential candidate
who, if elected, would cater to the ``liberal big spenders'' on
Capitol Hill.
   Turning his weekly radio address into a promotion for Vice
President George Bush, Reagan echoed the GOP presidential
candidate's jabs at Dukakis as a free-spending, soft-on-defense
liberal out of step with the American mainstream.
   In the Democratic response, Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, also was
sharply partisan, attacking Bush.
   Without referring to either candidate by name, Reagan repeated
the word ``liberal'' 14 times in his five-minute address.
   ``I'm sorry to say that the Congress' liberal leadership has one
answer to everything _ and that's raise your taxes. And if they
stay in control of the Congress, they may just find a way to raise
them,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, noting that in less than four weeks voters will choose a
new president, posed several questions:
   ``Why should we have a president who says, `no more taxes,' and
Congress have a liberal leadership that wants to tax and spend?''
Reagan asked, clearly referring to Bush's no-new-tax pledges.
   ``If we don't want a tax-and-spend liberal in the White House,
shouldn't we give the president a Congress that will work with
him?'' Reagan queried.
   Eckart said people in his district holds ``to many traditional
values -- hard work, strong moral and religious beliefs, pride in
their heritage, and the accomplishments of their children.''
   ``But they know that it's been the Democrats who have worked
hard to save their jobs, that it was George Bush and Dan Quayle who
opposed plant-closing and tough trade laws, but that it was Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen who led the fight to put America first.''
   Eckard also charged that ``George Bush has been a silent
partner, riddled with corruption, corruption that has reached into
the President's cabinet, to the Pentagon, from defense contractors
to Wall Street.''
   In his address, Reagan also claimed credit for the fact the
deficit for the fiscal 1989 budget is projected to be below $146
billion.
   If the deficit exceeded that figure, the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget act required automatic across-the-board cuts.
   ``Left to its own devices, Congress would not have done this,''
Reagan said. ``You see, Congress is still controlled by liberal big
spenders.''
   The Office of Management and Budget told Congress on Friday its
final projection of the fiscal 1989 federal deficit was just under
the $146 billion Gramm-Rudman target. If the projection had
exceeded that figure, defense and domestic spending would have been
cut by at least $10 billion.
   Instead of praising the bipartisan agreement that paved the way
for the accord, Reagan took a slap at the Democratic-run Congress,
saying ``Many of its liberal leaders are congratulating themselves
about the handling of the budget.''
   Reagan did acknowledge that Congress had passed all its spending
bills on time this year instead of bundling them into a huge,
emergency piece of legislation.
   But Capitol Hill couldn't have done it without him, he asserted.
   ``Congress heard my warning that if that happened again, I'd use
my veto pen...,'' Reagan said. ``So we stopped Congress from saying
once more `the dog ate my homework' when its budget assignment was
due.''
   The possibility of even a $10 billion cut _ which would make
only a small dent in the overall $1.1 trillion federal deficit _
forced leaders of both parties to avoid triggering the mandatory
cuts of the Gramm-Rudman bill.
   OMB's final projection for the 1989 fiscal year deficit is just
under $145.5 billion. The fiscal year began Oct. 1.
   If there had been $545 million more in federal spending, the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law would have required government
expenditures to be cut by whatever amount would have reduced the
deficit to $136 billion.
   Congressional leaders and administration officials worked
closely all year in an effort to ensure a tranquil budget process
that sidestepped the oft-repeated crises of previous years.
   Last November, following the stock market crash, Reagan and
congressional leaders reached a budget pact that set spending
limits for this year. That agreement, though not legally binding,
was largely adhered to and eased this year's budget work.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address:
   My fellow Americans, today we learned that there will be no
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings sequester this year. With that in mind I'd
like to take a moment to talk about one of Washington's favorite
pastimes _ making the federal budget.
   As Congress prepares to leave town, many of its liberal leaders
are congratulating themselves about their handling of the budget,
and yes, at least Congress didn't repeat its budget performance of
last year, one desperation bill called a continuing resolution
passed over two months late rather than the 13 regular
appropriations bill required by law.
   Congress heard my warning that if that happened again I'd use my
veto pen, even if it meant shutting down the entire government. So
we stopped Congress from once more saying, ``The dog ate my
homework,'' when its budget assignment was due, and we got them to
cut spending enough so that we'll meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
targets this year.
   But left to its own devices, Congress would not have done this.
You see, Congress is still controlled by liberal big-spenders, and
no matter when they hand in their homework, they still call every
paper, ``Tax and spend.''
   You may have heard a lot of campaign talk from our liberal
friends recently about the federal deficit and federal debt. What
you don't hear them say is that the president can't spend one dime
of the government's money without congressional appropriations.
Only Congress can decide how much the government spends. Only
Congress can pass spending bills. Only Congress can determine how
big the deficit will be, or if we're to have deficit at all.
   In fact, it is against the law for the president to spend a
penny more or a penny less than Congress directs him to spend. The
president can't add to the deficit. He can't subtract from it
either. That's Congress' job, and how many of us have stopped to
think that our liberal friends have had a majority in the House of
Representatives for 52 of the last 56 years and in both Houses of
Congress for 46 of those 56 years. And in all that time, there were
only eight scattered years in which the budget was balanced. The
last time was 1969.
   Over the years I've asked Congress for many spending cuts that
Congress with its liberal leadership has rejected. Add them all up
and they come to more than this year's entire budget deficit. Think
of it, we could have wiped out a year of deficits if our liberal
friends in Congress were as dedicated to reducing government
spending as we are.
   Of course, the liberal big-spenders in Congress will tell you
that they're for reducing the deficit and even for reducing
spending. But somehow for them, reduced spending always comes down
to reduced defense spending, and time and again when they cut
defense spending it's just been a cover for spending more on their
special interest programs.
   In six years, the liberal leadership in Congress cut defense
spending authority by over $125 billion and for every dollar they
cut from defense outlays, they added $2 to domestic spending. I've
called on our liberal friends in Congress to admit their addiction
to big spending and to give the president more tools to help them
kick the habit.
   And that's why I've wanted a balanced budget amendment, to
require them to live within their means. And it's why I've wanted a
line item veto for the president, so the president can go through
the budget, lift out bad spending, item by item, and make Congress
vote on it out in the open, not hidden with thousands of other
items.
   That way, if the spending really is bad, you'll know about it.
And your representatives will have to answer to you when they go
home and ask for your vote.
   You can see why the liberal congressional leadership is dead set
against the balanced budget amendment and the line item veto. They
like things just as they are. Although they act as if the first
chance they get, they'll find a way out of the discipline of
Graham-Rudman-Hollings. I'm sorry to say that a Congress liberal
leadership still has one answer to everything: Raise your taxes.
And if they stay in control of the Congress, they just might find a
way to raise them.
   In the next four weeks, as you're thinking over how you will
vote this year, I wish you'd consider something else as well. Since
we must ride two horses, Congress and the president, across every
stream, shouldn't they both be going the same way? Why should we
have a president who says ``No more taxes'' and Congress have a
liberal leadership that wants to tax and spend? Why should we have
a president who's for a line item veto and a balanced budget
amendment and Congress have a liberal leadership that's against
both?
   If we don't want to tax-and-spend liberal in the White House,
shouldn't we give the president, we do want, a Congress that will
work with him. And when it comes to giving the next president a
more receptive Congress, I hope you'll remember if your
representative and senator aren't part of the answer, you can be
sure, they're part of the problem.
   Until next week, thanks for listening and God bless you.

   A gunman killed an American who had
lived in Honduras for 26 years, police said Saturday. An anonymous
caller said a left-wing political group was responsible.
   Leo Mills, 63, originally from Woodward, Okla., was shot in the
head Friday with a pistol by a man who was walking down the street
behind him, a police spokesman said.
   A caller told radio stations that a previously unknown group,
the Morazan Front, claimed responsibility for the killing. The
anonymous spokesman said the group was leftist and killed Mills as
a symbol of the social changes that should take place in Honduras.
   Mills had married into a wealthy Honduran family, and he ran
their businesses and large landholdings even after he and his wife
separated.
   He had served an 18-month prison term in the 1981 killing of a
community leader who led squatters in an occupation of some of his
family's land.
   Friends of Mills said his body would be sent to the United
States to be buried in Woodward.
   Police were investigating.
   The Morazan Front apparently was named after Francisco Morazan,
an 1830s political leader who championed Central American unity and
is known as the Abraham Lincoln of Honduras.

<HEAD>New California Textbooks to Battle `Dumbing Down' Student Fare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a blow against dull and contrived
reading material, California's Board of Education has moved to
reverse the ``dumbing down'' of student textbooks and recapture the
magic of reading.
   The 11-member board on Friday approved a list of 25 children's
books educators said will replace stultifying, formula-dictated
texts with literature and classics of richness and diversity.
   At the same time, board member Armen Sarafian, responding to
criticism about lobbying by textbook publishers, demanded an
investigation by the state attorney general's office into the book
selection process.
   State Superintendent of Public Instruction Bill Honig had said
he thought some board members had become ``too cozy'' with the
publishers, accepting free rides and other things of value.
   California, with 11 percent of the nation's annual $1.5 billion
textbook expenditure, has great clout with the publishers.
   Honig and the board agreed, however, that the new books will go
a long way toward reviving the magic of reading for youngsters, and
exposing them to good writing.
   The exercises in the books stress comprehension rather than
single-word fill-in-the-blank answers that do little to help kids
understand what they have read, Honig said. Textbooks determine an
estimated 90 percent of what teachers teach, state education
officials say.
   Current prescribed texts meet a so-called ``readability
formula'' based on rote, repetition, numbers of syllables in a word
and the word-count in paragraphs _ a dust-dry formula critics say
robs children of the very elements that might motivate them to read.
   As an example, critics pointed to the ``dumbing down'' of
``Little Red Riding Hood'' by one textbook version apparently still
in use. The passage cited has Little Red repeating to exhaustion
the fact that she's got a bunch of apples. Says Red:
   ``I can put red apples in my basket ...
   ``I can put red apples into my basket for Grandma ...
   ``I have red apples ...
   ``I have big red apples ...
   ``I put the apples into my basket.''
   The public school officials were told there has been more
concern with controlling vocabulary than telling the story, with
individual words repeated ``even when they are inappropriate to the
story line.''
   ``Kids have told me that stories about Dick and Jane or Buffy
and Mack are boring,'' said Lisa Izutsu, a third-grade teacher at
Hamlin Street School in Canoga Park. ``Those stories don't spark
their imagination or their creativity. But (children's literature)
really gets them motivated and interested in reading.''
   The official revolt against stupidity in education included
board rejection of all spelling books that had been submitted for
consideration.
   The board declared that spelling should be taught along with
reading and writing, not as an isolated, unconnected exercise.
   Members also decided to require future textbooks to come with a
``consumer warning label'' listing included literary works that had
been abridged, adapted or excerpted. It was the third such decision
in as many years aimed at nudging publishers to provide more
thought-provoking fare for school children.
   In earlier action, the board rejected science texts lacking
detailed explanations of evolution, and math books that neglected
the basics of problem-solving in favor of rote skills.

<TEXT>
   A group of intellectuals who have
denounced Josip Broz Tito are demanding that the state-run media
publish a document that blames the late Yugoslav president for the
country's current crisis.
   The 19-member Committee in Defense of Intellectual Freedoms, in
a statement addressed to the Yugoslav leadership last June 27, said
Tito was to blame for creating an undemocratic, repressive
political system ``which has thwarted the progressive development
of the society.''
   The ruling Communist Party Politburo on Thursday sharply
denounced the statement. It said the document, which calls for a
``critical reapprisal of Tito's role,'' was the strongest attack
yet on the founder of Communist Yugoslavia.
   Now the committee wants its statement to be published by the
state-run press.
   In a statement received by The Associated Press on Saturday, the
committee said officials and the state-run press have branded them
``public enemies,'' even though their document has yet to be
published.
   The committee said it wanted the document to be published so the
public could evaluate its demands. The statement was signed by
prominent Yugoslav university professors, artists and scientists.
   The statement, dated Oct. 11, was addressed to the Yugoslav
Communist leadership.
   Tito, who died in May 1980 after ruling undisputed for 35 years,
is still officially revered in Yugoslavia and public criticism of
his policies can be prosecuted under Yugoslav law.
   ``Tito's role in making crucial political decisions and his
absolute power in shaping Yugoslav policies were so great that the
present-day position of the country, particularly its current deep
social crisis, cannot be understood or explained without a
comprehensive and objective scientific and critical reappraisal of
his historical responsibility,'' the June statement said.
   ``There can be no way out of the present economic, political and
moral crisis affecting Yugoslav society without a thorough critical
evaluation of past Yugoslav policies,'' it added.
   The intellectuals also criticized Tito's non-aligned foreign
policy for ``having isolated our country from its natural,
cultural, historical, economic and political surroundings'' in
Europe.
   The forum denounced Tito's lavish lifestyle, demanding to know
``the real costs of his rule.''
   The document triggered an open clash between national party
chief Stipe Suvar and Serbia's ambitious Communist Party leader
Slobodan Milosevic during the Politburo meeting on Thursday.
   Suvar, from Croatia, accused Serbian leaders of not doing enough
to stop attacks by intellectuals on Tito. Milosevic retorted
angrily that Serbia had been among the first to condemn the
intellectual attacks.
   Although the June document was signed only by 19 prominent
intellectuals, many nonconformist intellectuals consider that
Yugoslavia's current economic crisis, labor and ethnic unrest have
their roots in the Tito years.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis early Saturday
attended a birthday tribute to Jesse Jackson, praising his former
rival's work for the Democratic ticket and joking about a
controversy that temporarily strained their relationship.
   ``I didn't know anything about the celebration until today,''
Dukakis said in brief remarks after he arrived at the party just
after midnight. ``Jesse was supposed to call me early this morning
but he never made the call.
   ``I never knew anything about it until I got off the plane from
Sacramento and the press told me about it,'' Dukakis continued.
``Don't you think he'd give me a call first _ before everyone else?'
   The crowd of about 150 people clapped politely at the joke.
   When Dukakis selected Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate last
summer, he called other contenders for the No. 2 spot to inform
them of the choice. But he was unable to reach Jackson, who was
told of the selection by reporters at a Washington airport. Aides
described Jackson as infuriated because he was not notified
personally by Dukakis, and there was friction between the
candidates until they reached an apparent truce at the Democratic
National Convention.
   Dukakis' appearance at the Jackson celebration was one of only a
few joint appearances they have had since the convention.
   Dukakis began his his remarks with a series of jokes, and also
presented Jackson with a VCR and a campaign hat and jacket.
   ``Jesse's given me a lot of advice,'' Dukakis said. ``He's the
guy who told me to tell Bill Clinton to make his speech a little
longer. I told him I was going to ride a tank in Michigan and he
told me `those tanks are dangerous _ wear a helmet.'''
   On a more serious note, Dukakis paid tribute to Jackson's family
and praised him for his voter registration efforts.
   Jackson then took the microphone and challenged his supporters
to rally support for Dukakis and Bentsen.
   ``The governor has set the pace. He established the principles.
articulated the problems,'' Jackson said. ``My friends, Governor
Dukakis can be trusted to keep hope alive, to build the America of
our dreams.''

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lack of child care in businesses costs the
economy about $3 billion a year, jeopardizing economic growth as
more women are needed to enter the workforce, the head of a
national child care coalition said Saturday.
   Declining birth and labor force growth rates mean that
two-thirds of new jobs will have to be filled by women between now
and 1995, said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child
Care Action Committee in Washington, D.C.
   ``It's fairly clear that the lack of child care is an impediment
to entering the workforce,'' said Reisman, in Boston for a
conference of the Massachusetts Association of Day Care Agencies.
   Reisman's organization late last month issued a report calling
on the federal and state governments to play a greater role in
working with businesses to increase child care efforts such as
capital grants to employers for child care programs and parental
leaves.
   ``Only 7 percent of American households now fit the Beaver
Cleaver family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,''
the report said. ``As female labor force participation rates
continue to climb, the demand for child care will grow too.''
   The number of companies providing some form of child care has
increased from 110 to 3,500 in the past decade, according to the
study, but that still accounts for just six in 10,000 businesses.
   The $3 billion figure cited by the report is based on child
care-related work absences. Reisman said it does not include
estimates of lower productivity because of parents' worries over a
child, lateness, workforce departures or shorter work days.
   ``If we continue to ignore the growing demand for child care, we
risk limiting the expansion of the labor force and jeopardizing
economic growth,'' the 90-page report said.
   ``We endanger millions of young children _ the future labor
force _ for whom quality care during their first five years lays
the foundation for lifetime learning,'' it said. ``Children,
families, employers and the nation's economy all suffer from the
lack of affordable, quality child care.''
   The report was based on research commissioned from nine
economists and policy analysts and the results of a national child
care conference sponsored by the Child Care Action Campaign in
March.

   An overloaded ferry boat sank in
heavy seas in the central Philippines, and at least 55 people
drowned, the Coast Guard reported Saturday. It said 77 people were
rescued.
   The Coast Guard said the 35-ton Balangiga was sailing from the
Samar island port of Giporlos to Tacloban on Leyte island when it
sank early Friday after being buffeted by high winds and rough seas.
   Lt. Cesar Cahijas, Coast Guard commander in Tacloban, said four
vessels were dispatched to the area for search and rescue
operations.
   Coast Guard officials said the vessel was authorized to carry 92
passengers and crew. They did not say whether all those aboard the
ship had been accounted for.
   In Manila, Coast Guard officials said they were still awaiting a
complete report from Tacloban.
   Overloading is common on inter-island ferries in the
Philippines. Last December, more than 3,000 people died when the
passenger ship Dona Paz, which was sailing from Tacloban to Manila,
collided with an oil tanker off Mindoro island in the world's worst
peacetime shipping disaster.
   A congressional report cited widespread safety problems in
Philippine commercial shipping, including faulty communications and
lax rescue procedures.
   The Coast Guard, which is responsible for commercial shipping
within this archepeligo country of 7,100 islands, conducted its own
investigation but has not released the findings.
   Last May, at least 53 people died when a motor launch sank in
the same area as Friday's mishap.

   Officially, Les Aspin, the chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee, flew into town on an Air Force
plane to visit a nearby Army vehicle plant.
   ``The real reason,'' Aspin confided, ``is that Notre Dame is
playing Miami.''
   The game Saturday between the top-ranked Hurricanes and No. 4
Notre Dame captured the interest of football fans nationwide, and
the Wisconsin Democrat was one of them.
   Aspin flew in Friday from California, where he briefed Michael
Dukakis prior to Thursday's presidential debate. He was entitled to
use the Air Force transportation because he toured the AM General
Corp. plant in Mishawaka where the Hummer multipurpose military
vehicle is manufactured.
   Aspin said he saw nothing wrong with flying here at taxpayer
expense because it was official business. However, he admitted
flatly the timing of the visit was dictated by the football game.
   He said he would pay for his own transportation leaving South
Bend.
   Aspin also said he was the ``very powerful'' congressman
denounced by George Bush in the debate for alleged defense waste in
pushing through an appropriation for a truck contract the Army
didn't want.
   ``I'm the guy George Bush was talking about,'' Aspin said.
``Once again George has got it screwed up.''
   While he was instrumental in increasing appropriations for the
HEMAT trucks _ which are built in Wisconsin, but not in Aspin's
district _ the decision involved ``closing out the contract,'' he
said.
   Appropriations for the trucks were increased to buy 4,700
instead of 900 and close out production. But rather than the Army
not wanting those trucks, he said, the Army now wants 360 more.

they walked into Chasen's, a posh see-and-be-seen restaurant.
   But it wasn't clear for whom the hands clapped.
   Bush had a jump in the polls to celebrate on Friday after his
debate the night before with Democrat Michael Dukakis. Lasorda was
celebrating his team's newly won slot in the World Series.
   The dinner was hosted by producer Jerry Weintraub. Guests
included entertainers Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Roger Moore and
Tony Danza, and Dodger team owner Peter O'Malley.

   Rock star Elton John stormed off the
stage with neither a goodbye nor an encore after rowdy behavior at
a concert in this Detroit suburb left one fan with a broken leg.
   The crowd booed John when he left the stage at The Palace of
Auburn Hills after playing for 90 minutes Thursday night. The
British singer reportedly was upset when two fans rushed the stage.
   A 25-year-old Grosse Pointe Woods man suffered a broken leg
during the concert when he alegedly was thrown over a railing onto
a concrete ledge 10 feet below.
   The incident occurred near the end of the concert, when the man
and his girlfriend said they asked three men to sit down, prompting
an argument.
   Charges of assault with intent to do great bodily harm were
filed against three suburban Detroit men with the Oakland County
prosecutor. The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison upon conviction.

   Friends of retired Army Sgt. Barry
Sadler, who wrote and sang ``The Ballad of the Green Berets,'' say
the ex-soldier is showing signs of recovering from a gunshot wound
to the head.
   Sadler is still comatose and seriously ill at the Veterans
Administration hospital here, a hospital spokesman says, but
friends say the Vietnam veteran and reputed Contra trainer appears
to be improving.
   ``He is doing much better,'' said Sadler's literary agent, Bob
Robison. ``He moves sometimes and he opens his eyes some, but we
can't make a real prognosis until he comes out of the coma.''
   Sadler was shot in the forehead Sept. 7 near his home in
Guatemala City, Guatemala, in an apparent robbery attempt.
   The former soldier lived in Nashville after the recording
``Green Berets'' became a hit in 1968, but left the country after
serving 30 days of a four- to five-year sentence for a 1978
voluntary manslaughter conviction.
   Robison said Sadler's latest book, a follow-up to ``Razor,'' a
book about mercenaries, already had been sent to him when Sadler
was shot.
   Sadler has written almost 30 books, including those in the
``Casca'' series, about a Roman soldier doomed to roam through time
after stabbing Christ on the cross.

   A simulated emergency turned into the real thing
for Mayor Coleman Young during a demonstration of the city's new
911 phone system.
   Young fielded a staged call at police headquarters Friday about
an alley fire but forgot to hang up the phone. The mayor then wound
up handling a real 911 call about a break-in in progress on the
city's west side.
   Young handled the situation calmly, asking the caller for her
address and details of the crime. The caller told Young the
burglars were trying to break into a neighboring house.
   A police car was dispatched to the scene but no arrests were
made, officials said.
   ``I kept the ... thing in my ear and since it was an open
(line), whoever was dispatching it thought there was an operator on
it, and the call came through,'' Young said of the emergency call.
``I kept waiting for somebody to take it off my hands. And they
never did.''

<TEXT>
   Sinhalese anti-government radicals
killed six people, including a policeman whose severed head was
displayed in public, a government statement said Saturday.
   Constable N. Ratnayake, 25, was shot and killed in the southern
town of Matara, 90 miles south of Colombo on Saturday.
   The killers, who are members of the radical Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front, later cut off his head and displayed it, the
statement said.
   The front opposses the Indian-brokered peace accord aimed at
ending the 5-year-old Tamil separatist campaign. The group has been
blamed for over 450 deaths since the accord was signed in July 1987.
   The front has vowed to kill government officials, members of the
security forces, or anyone who supports the accord.
   Also in Matara, a Sri Lankan army soldier was shot and killed by
front gunmen at his home.
   In Kamburupitiya, also in Matara district, three supporters of
the governing United National Party were assassinated on Friday by
front members, the statement said.
   In Ampara, 125 miles east of Colombo, a Sinhalese businessman
was shot and killed.
   The front is opposed to the Tamil aaccord because it says the
peace pact gives too many concessions to the Tamils who make up
only 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. The Sinhalese
account for about 75 percent of the population.
   The accord has failed after the most powerful of the Tamil
separatist groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rejected
it and said it did not meet the aspirations of the Tamils.
   The Tamils say they are discriminated by the Sinhalese, who
control the government and the military.

   More than 50 opponents of abortion were arrested Saturday
outside a clinic in Indianapolis, while another anti-abortion
demonstration in Jackson, Miss., was peaceful.
   In Atlanta, meanwhile, scene of three months of anti-abortion
demonstrations, of the 463 arrested outside four clinics earlier
this month, only seven remained in jail over the weekend.
   In Indianapolis, some 150 to 200 protesters gathered outside
Affiliated Women's Services on the city's west side, said Lois
Bennett, director of the clinic.
   The protesters, some of them children, sat before the entrance
to the clinic, locked arms and sang the spiritual ``The Battle Hymn
of the Republic.'' They refused to move when Marion County deputies
asked them, and some were carried away one by one, Bennett said.
Fifty-five were arrested.
   The clinic was prepared for the demonstration and had about 25
escorts on hand to accompany clients, about 30 of whom were
scheduled for visits Saturday morning, Bennett said. ``We had a
couple of cancellations and reschedules,'' she said.
   More than 450 people were arrested in Atlanta ealier this month
after the anti-abortion group calling itself Operation Rescue began
picketing and blocking entrances at clinics in that city. About
1,200 demonstrators have been arrested in Atlanta since the
protests began during the Democratic National Convention in July.
   In Jackson, Miss., about 75 abortion protesters chanted, prayed,
and held signs in front of three clinics where abortions are
performed, during what group leaders called Operation Rescue II.
   Roy McMillan, head of the Christian Action Group that sponsored
the protest, told the protesters they were trying to ``warn people
of the evil way'' of abortion
   At the Mississippi Women's Medical Clinic, an unidentified
female protester had a confrontation with security personnel
because she trespassed while trying to stop two women from entering
the clinic.
   ``Please don't kill your babies,'' the protester yelled at the
women.
   Police arrived to arrest the woman, but she reportedly had left.
   Among those still in jail in Atlanta were Richard Cowden-Guito
and James McWilliams, who were arrested in a July 19 demonstration.
They haven't been released because they have refused to sign their
legal names on bond slips.
   ``My hope would be, and my intent is, to stay here the rest of
my life,'' said Cowden-Guito, 39, of New York City, who said he is
a free-lance journalist.
   ``I may have trespassed, but I certainly did not trespass
against God's law,'' McWilliams said.

   Assailants with axes and knives attacked an
Israeli businessman in the West Bank after Israeli forces raided
three nearby villages Saturday and rounded up 20 Palestinians
suspected of making bombs.
   Israeli soldiers, meanwhile, shot and wounded eight Palestinian
protesters in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   A Palestinian shot earlier last week died Saturday of his
wounds, the Israeli-owned Itim news agency reported.
   Itim identified the victim as 19-year-old Ahmed Yaacub Mustafa,
from the village of Qibiya, shot during a demonstration in nearby
Ramallah.
   Mustafa's death raised to 298 the number of Palestinians killed
in the 10-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Six Israelis have died in the uprising.
   The Israeli, 56-year-old David Eliahu, suffered deep gashes in
his head, neck and back when he was attacked in Jenin, 60 miles
north of Jerusalem, the army and Israel army radio said. The
assailants also stole his pistol, the radio said.
   Eliahu had been visiting business acquaintancesin Jenin before
heading off alone, army radio said.
   ``About 30 people attacked me,'' Eliahu later said in a
telephone interview with Israel army radio. ``I tried to run
towards where the army was but they started beating me and I
couldn't get away.''
   Eliahu said he finally managed to reach Israeli military
headquarters.
   The army quoted hospital officials as saying Eliahu suffered
minor injuries and was in stable condition.
   Troops blocked the entrance to Jenin, searched for the
assailants and made several arrests.
   Hours earlier, Israeli police and soldiers raided three villages
near Jenin _ Jalbun, Faqqua and Arabuna _ and uncovered a cache of
explosives, timers and batteries for manufacturing bombs.
   They arrested 20 villagers in possession of the cache. Police
also suspect the group of setting fire to forests in the Mount
Gilboa area in northern Israel, flying Israeli-outlawed Palestinian
flags, blocking roads and taking part in disturbances.
   Israel radio said the group operated inside Israel.
   In other developments Saturday, troops fired on rock-throwing
Palestinian protesters trying to block them from entering the West
Bank village of Qusin, Israel radio said. The army said it was
checking the report.
   Two other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes in the
Tulkarm refugee camp and old marketplace of Nablus 50 miles north
of Jerusalem, the radio said.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot at 100 rock-throwing students
in the souternmost town of Rafah, wounding two teenagers, the army
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   Three other Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops in
other parts of the strip.
   Israel officials estimate that 7,000 Arabs have been wounded in
the occupied territories since the Palestinian uprising broke out
Dec. 8. Palestinian sources put the figure at about 18,000.

   A fireman and a former firefighter have
been arrested but townspeople are certain the book is not closed on
the arson fires that have terrified the community since May.
   ``I don't think anyone believes it's over. Everybody seems to be
looking for another person or two,'' Robert Bruce, owner of the Old
Corner Store, said Saturday.
   ``That's making the assumption that (the two arrested) are even
involved, which is hard for us to accept,'' he said.
   ``There's still a lot of hot tempers,'' said William Perkins,
whose home was burned in May. ``I don't know if the whole mystery
has been solved or not.''
   On Wednesday, Lance Lalumiere, 23, a former member of the
volunteer fire department in this northern New Hampshire community
of 850, was arrested and charged with burning his brother's log
cabin in August.
   One day later, Lawrence Coulter Jr., 19, also a volunteer
firefighter, was charged with setting fire to a vacation home in
nearby Dalton on Oct. 3.
   During a news conference in Concord, authorities said they would
seek indictments against Lalumiere for 15 other fires, and said
they had suspects in five other arsons. They declined to elaborate
   State police Lt. Gary Sloper would not say if authorities
believe the two collaborated, saying only they were investigating
that possibility. Sloper has indicated there may be more arrests.
   On Friday, at a hearing on a prosecution request to revoke
Lalumiere's $50,000 bail, prosecutors filed documents saying
Lalumiere had admitted committing 16 other acts of arson in the
Jefferson area.
   Prosecutors also sought to revoke Coulter's $50,000 cash bail.
During his arraignment Thursday, a state police officer said
Coulter is considered a suspect in the Jefferson fires as well. He
did not elaborate.
   The bail hearings continue Monday and Tuesday. Both men remained
in jail. Neither has entered a plea.
   The fires began in fields and brush and escalated to buildings.
No one was killed or seriously hurt, but more than a dozen people
were left homeless by the 21 fires in Jefferson, two in Lancaster
and one in Dalton.
   Many people stayed up nights to guard their property, with guns
ready.
   Residents described Lalumiere, a dishwasher at a local
restaurant, as a hard worker who left the fire department after
moving out of town for a time. He was under 24-hour surveillance
several weeks before his arrest and had been questioned several
times by police.
   Coulter's arrest was more shocking because of the deep roots his
well-respected family has in the town.
   His father was a firefighter and his mother helped organize a
Sept. 16 fund-raiser that brought in about $10,000 for the fire
department.
   ``There was no reason to ever question his integrity,'' said
Bruce, who employed Coulter part-time the past two years at the Old
Corner Store. ``He was an excellent employee.''
   ``I still think the general feeling in town is there's more
involved in this, if in fact these (two) are involved. I don't
think anyone is ready to accept the fact they are alone,'' he said.

   About 60 mothers and their children
marched to City Hall on Saturday to protest the government's
decision to open Laguna Verde, Mexico's first nuclear power plant.
   ``I feel helpless, not only for myself, but also for my
children,'' said Rafaela Delfin, a mother of four.
   Jose Luis Alcudia, secretary of energy, mines and industry,
announced Friday that workers would begin loading 92 tons of
uranium into one of Laguna Verde's reactors on Saturday.
   Officials said the loading would take 10-25 days and after
testing the reactor would be ready to generate power within six
months.
   The woman plan to participate in a protest meeting Sunday in
Palmesola, the town nearest the plant at Laguna Verde, located near
the Gulf of Mexico and 30 miles from this port.

   Five nuns locked in a spiritual
battle over the intrusion of the modern world into their cloistered
lives approached the end of their second week barricaded in their
monastery's infirmary.
   Their diocesan leader, Bishop Frank Rodimer, is calling the
increasingly tense standoff within the Roman Catholic Church a
scandal and says it stems mainly from personaly differences. The
dispute has even involved the Vatican, 1979 Nobel Prize winner
Mother Teresa of Calcutta and, indirectly, Walt Disney and Julie
Andrews.
   The Carmelite nuns at the Monastery of the Most Blessed Virgin
Mary of Mount Carmel are cloistered, ordinarily having no contact
with the outside world.
   But the five rebels have a spokeswoman, 28-year-old Sister John
of the Cross, who has handled the media with a touch of savvy while
explaining that the five are fighting the introduction of modern
conveniences into the monastery.
   Four of the nuns locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4
because they feared they would be thrown out of the monastery. A
fifth joined them shortly afterward. They say they are trying to
remain in the monastery despite a notice of dismissal they received
in June from their relatively new prioress, Mother Teresa Hewitt.
   Rodimer said the case stems from a personality conflict between
the nuns, ranging in age from 28 to 71, and their new prioress, who
replaced a woman the five became emotionally attached to.
   ``I believe the bishop is simply clouding the issue when he
brings up personality conflicts,'' Sister John told The Associated
Press in an interview last week. ``He's trying to make it something
it is not.''
   Sister John says the dismissal notice was issued after she and
the other four protesters objected to the liberalization of the
monastery with the introduction of newspapers, sweets and
television, along with videotapes of the ``The Sound of Music,''
the 1960s hit musical in which Andrews played a woman who left a
convent, and the Disney classic ``Babes In Toyland.''
   An appeal of the pending dismissal has been filed with the
Vatican and the nuns intend to stay in the infirmary until they
hear from Rome, Sister John said.
   The protesting nuns met Saturday with the Rev. Kevin Culligan of
Milwaukee, who was sent by the Vatican to help resolve the dispute.
Sister John declined to discuss the visit. She said more details
would be available Sunday and she did not think the nuns would
leave their refuge over the weekend.
   Telephones at the diocese's offices went unanswered Saturday and
neither Culligan nor diocesan officials could be reached for
comment.
   Sister John argues that their struggle has been misunderstood by
the media, which she says have simplified the conflict down to five
nuns who don't want television and sweets in their monastery vs. a
bishop, prioress and eight other nuns who do.
   ``The candy and television in themselves are not the issue,''
Sister John says. ``We are to live a life of penance, of austerity.
We are not to be distracted by anything. The candy represents a
lack of mortification.''
   Rodimer disagrees, saying the five are rebelling against the new
prioress. In a news conference Wednesday, Rodimer referred with a
touch of sarcasm to the television and sweets as ``very profound
issues.''
   No comment from the prioress was available Saturday; the
telephone at the monastery was busy. But Mother Hewitt told The
Star-Ledger of Newark earlier that the schism was between nuns who
were loyal to the former prioress and those who accept the new
authority, not between conservative and liberal sisters.
   She also said the changes introduced in the monastery were
allowed under Vatican II's reforms. Television, magazines and
newspapers had been available for several years, she said, but she
agreed that she had broadened their use to ``balance what I thought
had been too small a recognition of human needs.''
   Rodimer warned the nuns they could be relieved of their vows.
   ``They've broken the vow of obedience, and I suppose it's a
scandal in that sense,'' he said.
   The sister says she doesn't want to cause trouble within the
Church. She says she realizes that some people think it's
hypocritical of the nuns to be espousing their conservative beliefs
to television reporters.
   ``What happened to us, we hadn't planned,'' she said. ``We can't
wait until it's all over with. (The protest) does appear as a
contradiction. We don't like it, but it's the only way we can
obtain help at this moment.''
   Supporters in the town have been donating fruit baskets to the
nuns. And Mother Teresa of Calcutta has agreed to talk with Pope
John Paul II about the dispute this week, Sister John says.
   Sister John says she will continue fighting for the values for
which she has sacrificed her secular life.
   ``I love rock 'n' roll and I love the Yankees. I'm a normal
person,'' she says. ``But I've sacrificed those things to obtain
something better. I know God has called me here to Morris Township.
I was not called to any other monastery on earth.''

<HEAD>Soviet Spying Increases In Gorbachev Era, CIA Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has intensified its spying
against the United States despite warmer superpower ties under
Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the No. 2 man at the CIA said
Saturday.
   ``Since Gorbachev's ascension to power, the hostile intelligence
threat against us has grown,'' said Robert M. Gates, the CIA's
deputy director. ``The number of operations against us has
certainly increased.''
   Gates also gave a gloomy assessment of international affairs,
predicting that in the next five to 10 years some nations may
suffer economic collapse because of the AIDS epidemic and that drug
kingpins could be elected to govern a major country.
   In a speech and question-and-answer session at a convention of
the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, Gates said:
   _ Chemical weapons _ ``the poor man's atomic bomb _ could be the
``most immediate threat to world peace and to the security of the
United States and its allies. He predicted a rapid spread of
chemical weapons among developing countries, ``now that the
Iran-Iraq war has broken the moral barriers against their use.''
   _ Remarks by House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, that the CIA had
tried to provoke Nicaragua's Sandinista regime into repressive
tactics are not going to have ``any effect on our relations with
the oversight committees.''
   Speaking of Moscow, Gates said that ``despite improved
U.S.-Soviet relations, we have seen an increase this year of Soviet
attempts to recruit U.S. sources.''
   The choice of Vladimir Kryuchkov as chairman of the KGB ``likely
will mean an intensification of Soviet intelligence efforts against
the United States and it allies,'' he said.
   Kryuchkov, believed to be a career specialist in foreign
intelligence gathering, replaced Viktor Chebrikov this month as
chairman of the Committee for State Security, which is known by its
Russian acronym KGB. That agency conducts overseas espionage and
acts as a domestic security service.
   In a speech to another group on Friday, Gates said that
Gorbachev's efforts to transform the Soviet economy have not
succeeded so far.
   ``After three years of reform, restructuring and turmoil, there
has been little, if any, slowing in the downward spiral of the
Soviet economy,'' he said.
   Gates said Saturday that federal agencies must develop
``realistic criteria'' to gauge whether political and economic
change in the Soviet Union is genuinely reshaping the foundations
of the system or whether the country's totalitarian structure
endures.
   Turning to other developments around the world, Gates told the
former intelligence officers that at least 15 developing countries
will be able to build ballistic missiles by the year 2000, and that
20 countries were developing chemical weapons.
   The $300-billion-a-year international drug trade ``will get much
worse before it gets better,'' and no single country or group of
countries can solve the problem.
   In some countries, drug gangs have bribed officials and editors
and courted public opinion through charity, he said.
   ``It may be only a matter of time before we are faced with a
freely elected, legal narco-government in a major country,'' he
said. He did not name any nations in which he thought that might
happen.
   Asked what the emergence of a ``narco-government'' would mean
for U.S. foreign policy, Gates said, ``I don't think anybody has
thought very much about that. We are trying to bring to the
attention of policy makers things that are likely to happen in five
to 10 years.''
   AIDS, the Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome, differs from
such past epidemics as the black death of the Middle Ages by
striking not the old and weak but the young and active educated
urban middle classes _ ``the very cadre that no developing country
can afford to lose,'' he said.
   ``Some economies _ or at least their industrial structures _ may
collapse, and some countries could become virtually ungovernable,''
he said. Again, he did not mention any countries by name, but AIDS
has taken a particularly heavy toll on nations in East and Central
Africa.
   Only in the past year has the AIDS threat to the structure of
national societies been highlighted in CIA reports, though the drug
problem has been a concern somewhat longer, Gates said.

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen, acknowledging polls showing the Democrats behind, spoke
Saturday of a Democratic comeback this year like those that elected
Harry Truman and John Kennedy.
   ``Our party has a proud tradition of closing from behind and
winning those elections,'' he told about 500 people at an AFL-CIO
regional conference. He said Truman and John Kennedy were also down
in the polls but came back to win.
   ``We're going to do just like Harry Truman. We're going to tell
the truth and the Republicans are going to think it's hell,''
Bentsen told a crowd earlier Saturday at St. Louis' Soulard Market,
in Truman's home state of Missouri.
   ``I can't help but remember Harry Truman out there when the
press had written him off,'' the 67-year-old Texas senator said,
standing on a podium amid the vegetable displays in the open-air
market.
   While polls showed Truman losing to New York Gov. Thomas Dewey,
the Democratic crowds kept getting bigger, he said. ``And I can
still remember that Chicago newspaper saying Dewey had won,'' said
Bentsen, recalling the famous picture of Truman holding up a
newspaper front page.
   In 1960, he said, ``The weekend before (the election), John
Kennedy was eight points behind and went on to win'' because of
``the drive and the commitment and the enthusiasm of the American
people.''
   On a day of campaigning before diverse crowds in Missouri,
Pennsylvania and New York, Bentsen repeated the themes that
Democrats hope will resonate with voters by Election Day, including
trade, jobs, education, Social Security, and a ``squeeze'' on the
middle class.
   Bentsen told the food sellers in St. Louis that American
agriculture exports had declined 40 percent since 1980, and that
600,000 good-paying industrial jobs had been lost.
   ``We're tired of exporting jobs. We want to export products and
keep the jobs here, not in Taiwan or South Korea,'' he said.
   In Wilkes-Barre, at an auditorium filled with mostly elderly
people, he said the Republicans had repeatedly tried to cut Social
Security and Medicare and that George Bush could not be trusted.
   ``I just really can't imagine someone at the age of Social
Security, or close to it, who can vote for that other crowd,'' he
said.
   In his speech at the New York labor rally, Bentsen said the
economic expansion the Republicans were touting was ``a hoax'' for
many Americans.
   ``They've created an economy where the rich get richer, the poor
get poorer and everyone in between gets squeezed,'' he said.
   It was the Democrats who supported, and the Republicans who
opposed raising the minimum wage and giving 60 days notice for
laid-off workers, he said.
   Bentsen was also scheduled in New York to meet with Hispanic
leaders and journalists, and attend a fund-raiser in Brooklyn.
   He was flying to Washington Saturday night but was to return to
the campaign trail on Monday with stops in Texas and California.
   When he talked at his stops about Democratic campaign comebacks,
he also repeated the story of a Democrat who didn't quite overcome
his deficit.
   ``I can't help but think back to what happened to Hubert
Humphrey'' in 1968, he said.
   ``On Oct. 10, Hubert Humphrey was 10 points behind on the polls,
came within seven-tenths of one percent of winning. If he had made
some of those speeches a little shorter, and (made) a few more
stops, he might've made it,'' Bentsen said.

   A silver- and gold-plated toothbrush
that belonged to Napoleon I sold Saturday for $21,000 at an auction
in Munich, auction officials said.
   The Hermann Historica auction house said the toothbrush,
decorated with the French emperor's coat of arms, was lost at the
battle of Waterloo in 1815. It came from the estate of a British
officer who found it after the battle, a statement from the auction
house said.
   The buyer was not identified.
   The statement said the toothbrush sold for less than the
original asking price of $25,900. It said the utensil had suffered
severe wear through regular use.
   Napoleon died in 1821.

   A family whose complaint about a
missing burial vault prompted the arrest of a funeral director has
discovered their relative's coffin contains not just the body, but
a load of garbage.
   Relatives of Danny Pitts had his grave opened Oct. 7 after
pallbearers at his funeral said they saw funeral director Bobby
Wilks bury the casket without a vault.
   Pitts' family had planned to rebury him with a vault Friday, but
decided to take a last look inside the coffin.
   Inside, Pitts' body was surrounded by refuse _ a vacuum cleaner
bag full of dirt, empty dog food cans and magazines.
   ``I knew the casket was too heavy,'' said relative Donald Flatt.
   Wilks, charged Friday with six counts of obtaining money under
false pretenses, was in the Robertson County jail Saturday under
$82,500 bond. He also is charged in another county with larceny by
false pretenses, as is his son, Gary.
   Authorities searched the Wilk's Barber Funeral Home and his home
Friday, but would not say what they were looking for.
   Meanwhile, family members of people buried by Wilks continued to
exhume their relatives' bodies this weekend.
   Gary Wilks' wife, Teresa, said her father-in-law was apologetic
when she spoke to him Friday.
   ``All he would say was, `I'm sorry y'all have to be put through
this,'' Teresa Wilks said. ``He's definitely having mental
problems. He's contemplated suicide and he's just not the same
person anymore. He just stares off into space.''
   Exhumations have so far revealed 15 bodies improperly buried by
Wilks' funeral home.

   Lukas Knutsson climbed the railing
Saturday morning of the tallest bridge in the eastern United States
as thousands of people gathered around. A few seconds later he
jumped.
   Knutsson, from Cambridge, England, was one of the more than 300
parachutists from around the world who leaped from the New River
Gorge Bridge during the ninth annual Bridge Day.
   ``This is a totally unique sport,'' Knutsson said shortly after
his first jump from the 876-foot bridge. ``It's the closest a man
can get to flying.
   ``The second I was off, it was beautiful. The more I jump, the
more I can appreciate it. I'm going to jump as many times as I
can.''
   State police reroute the two northbound lanes of U.S. 19 one day
each year and let pedestrians crowd onto the highway to watch as
brave souls leap and rappel from North America's second-highest
bridge, about 40 miles southeast of Charleston.
   The National Park Service said 150,000 showed up to watch
Saturday's show, which was marred last year by a the death of a
jumper.
   Steven Gyrsting, 25, of Paoli, Pa., died after an eight-second
free fall into rocks alongside the New River Gorge National River.
   Few were deterred Saturday and police reported no serious
injuries. About 600 jumps were made, with most jumpers using bigger
pilot chutes. The parachutists aim for a small beach, but some end
up landing in the water.
   Gerard Tobin of Baltimore, Md., was forced to wait for his jump
on the bridge's rail while a train passed below. After his jump he
said the five-minute wait added to his nervousness.
   ``Damn straight it scares you,'' said Tobin, who was attending
his fourth Bridge Day. ``Death goes through your mind. It scares
you and makes you think about reality.''
   ``It's risky,'' added Dave Garen of Winooski, Vt., who had never
jumped from a bridge before. ``I don't like risk, but I like
challenges. I wouldn't do it regularly, but once or twice a year
would be OK.
   ``It scares me more than a plane jump. In a plane, you have
2,000 feet below you. Here, you only have 876 feet. You try to keep
that out of your mind. If you screw up, you only have eight
seconds.''
   Members of BASE, so named because its members leap from
stationary objects like buildings, antennas, spans and earth forms,
look forward to Bridge Day because it is the only time they can
make legal jumps from a bridge.
   ``This is the only legal bridge jump in the world,'' said Jean
Boenish of Hawthorne, Calif. ``The thing that makes this
challenging is because its the first BASE jump for many of the
divers.''

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate Again In Support Of Activist Priest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ About 7,000 people marched Saturday
through the streets of Port-au-Prince in a third day of protests
against a Roman Catholic church directive that ordered an activist
priest to leave Haiti.
   Sympathizers on balconies sprinkled the sweating marchers with
water as they passed through downtown streets chanting slogans
demanding the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide be allowed to remain in
Haiti.
   The three-hour demonstration, like those on Thursday and Friday,
began in front of the charred ruins of Aristide's St. Jean Bosco
church in a downtown slum district.
   On Sept. 11, thugs with firearms and machetes entered the
church, killed 12 parishioners, wounded 70 and set the building
ablaze.
   The massacre provoked a revolt within the armed forces that
ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17 and replaced him with Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril. Coup leaders said they wanted to end
state-sponsored violence and to return Haiti to democratic rule.
   Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier was elected president in 1957 in
what was considered Haiti's last fair election, and made himself
president-for-life in 1964. Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier
assumed the presidency upon his father's death in 1971, and
remained in power until he fled to France in 1986 during
anti-government uprisings.
   Namphy headed a provisional government immediately after
Duvalier went into exile, but domestic unrest and violence has
prevailed since then.
   On Friday, the Rev. Guire Poulard, bishop of the southern town
of Jacmel, said on the church's Radio Soleil that a solution to the
issue of Aristide's transfer could be found.
   ``A discussion can be held to see how we might envisage the
problem,'' he said.
   Aristide, a Haitian, was an outspoken critic of Namphy's
military regime. He is an advocate of liberation theology, which
demands social justice for the poor, and has been cricitized by
some Catholic leaders as promoting violence and class struggle.
   Aristide announced Monday on Radio Soleil that he had received a
message from the Vatican ordering him to leave Haiti by Oct. 17.
   He did not specify who issued the order, but Stephane
Francisque, a close friend, told The Associated Press the priest's
Salesian Order had told him to report to the Sainte Claire parish
in Montreal.
   The demonstrations Thursday and Friday attracted about 6,000
supporters.
   Friday's demonstration was winding down when a rumor spread that
Aristide was being flown out of the country. Protesters then
barricaded the road leading to the Port-au-Prince airport and
police fired warning shots to disperse the crowd. One man was hit
in the foot by a bullet.
   In a statement read over Radio Soleil on Friday, 48 parish
priests from Port-au-Prince said Aristide ``is preaching the Gospel
of Jesus Christ and the social doctrine of the Church. In the
present context Haiti needs Rev. Aristide.''

   Rain was widely scattered over the central part of the nation
Saturday, and temperatures hit record lows in the Southeast
although the prolonged cold spell across the East was beginning to
relax.
   Showers were widely scattered over the northern Rockies, the
northern Plains, the central high Plains and the lower Great Lakes.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered from east-central
Missouri to southern Indiana.
   Rainfall totals for the six-hour period up to 2 p.m. EDT were
generally less than a quarter of an inch.
   Record lows reported Saturday were 35 at Athens, Ga.; 43 at
Beaufort, S.C.; 38 at Cape Hatteras, N.C.; 41 at Savannah, Ga., and
35 at Wilmington, N.C. Records were tied at Caribou, Maine, at 25;
at Charleston, S.C., at 40; and Columbia, S.C., at 32.
   However, during the weekend highs were expected to reach the 70s
as far north as Pennsylvania, with 60s over much of New England.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Caribou, Maine, to 94 at Palm Springs, Calif. Saturday
morning's low for the 48 states was 19 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were
forecast from the middle Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes
region and western New England. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
also were forecast from Arizona to southwestern Texas, and across
extreme southern Florida. Showers were forecast from the northern
Pacific Coast to northwestern Montana.
   Highs only in the upper 40s were predicted across northern
Maine; in the 50s across northern Minnesota and much of the rest of
New England; in the 60s from the northern Pacific Coast to the
northern Rockies and from the Dakotas to New York state; in the 80s
across the Florida Peninsula, the southern Plains, the California
valleys and the desert Southwest; and in the 70s elsewhere across
the nation.

<HEAD>Attempt To Recreate 10,000-Year-Old Voyage Scuttled By Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gale force winds on Saturday forced six
Greeks paddling a papyrus boat across the Aegean Sea to abandon
their attempt to recreate a 10,000-year-old voyage.
   ``It is impossible for a boat six meters (20 feet) long to face
such weather conditions at a time when larger ships were forced to
return to safe harbors,'' the Hellenic Institute of Naval Tradition
said.
   The canoe-like boat, made of yellow papyrus stems lashed
together with rope, set off eight days ago from Lavrion, a port
near Athens, for the island of Melos. The 94-mile trip was expected
to take about nine days.
   The boat was forced to abandon its attempt 25 miles from Melos
at the Cycladic island of Serifos, the institute's announcement
said.
   The 5-foot-wide Papyrela _ Greek for papyrus _ was launched in
an effort to determine how Stone Age sailors could have reached the
island to obtain obsidian, a volcanic glass used to manufacture
cutting tools.
   Obsidian, found only on Melos, was discovered in a southern
Greek cave by U.S. archeologists in 1972. The material, which was
dated to around 8,000 B.C., was crafted into razor-sharp blades and
belonged to Mesolithic cave dwellers.
   The Greek boat was built on the island of Corfu using papyrus
clumps found at a nearby lake. It was patterned on a centuries-old
local design.
   Papyrus boats were used in ancient Egypt around 5,000 B.C. In
1969, a Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, tried to sail the Ra-I,
a boat built from the reeds, across the Atlantic.
   The Ra-I sank eight weeks and 3,000 miles into the journey, a
few hundred miles from the Caribbean. A later boat, the Ra-II,
successfully sailed from Safi, Morocco to the Bahamas in 1970.
   The institute said Saturday that it hoped to resume the voyage
when weather conditions improved.
   An escort ship that accompanied the boat was due to arrive
Sunday in Athens' port of Piraeus.

   A state-sponsored deer hunt for
children as young as 8 drew fire Saturday from animal welfare
groups and educators who claim it's too traumatic to have kids kill
the likes of Bambi.
   A Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission spokesman
defended the hunt in this rural military reservation as a way to
educate youngters about gun safety and hunting etiquette.
   Forty children from 8-to 15-years old, accompanied by adults,
were expected to take part in the weekend shotgun hunt in the wilds
at the sprawling Florida National Guard reservation, southwest of
Jacksonville.
   Three others are scheduled in the next two weeks. The commission
has sponsored similar hunts in the last three years, but without
much protest.
   ``Our worst fears were confirmed _ that little children were in
a sense being indoctrinated to hunt,'' said Wayne Pacelle, director
of the New York-based Fund for Animals, which claims about 200,000
members and is opposed to all hunting. ``We consider this
state-sponsored cruelty.''
   Pacelle, who visited the hunt area Saturday morning, said a
10-year-old and a 13-year-old killed one deer each, the first for
each. The hunt had a 40-deer limit.
   Henry Cabbage, a commission spokesman, said the agency was
providing a public service by helping to teach safety.
   ``These kids applied for these hunts. They're interested in
hunting. Their parents are interested in teaching them,'' Cabbage
said in Tallahassee. ``The Fund for Animals is on record that they
are opposed to hunting. It just gives them a handle to promote
their ultimate objective of taking away the right to hunt.''
   ``Having children kill animals for fun is ridiculous,'' said
Sharon Bailey of North Miami, who heads the Florida chapter of the
Friends of Animals, a national anti-hunting group. ``It twists the
values of our children. I've taken 8-year-olds to see Bambi. Even
that upsets them,'' she said of the animated Disney movie.
   Earlier this week, animal-rights activist Cleveland Amory
confronted Gov. Bob Martinez at a Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce
breakfast and demanded he cancel the state-sanctioned hunt. Amory
is an author who helped found the Fund for Animals.
   Martinez ignored Amory's comments and later said the hunt should
go on. He said it fosters closer relationships between parents and
their children.
   Meanwhile, about 75 protesters turned out and three were
arrested as the Air Force Academy opened its grounds in Colorado
Springs, Colo., to hunters Saturday for the first legal deer hunt
there in 18 years.
   The Rocky Mountain Humane Society led the demonstration on the
academy grounds, and humane society executive director Robin
Doxbury was one of the three arrested on criminal trespass charges.
All three later were released.
   Air Force officials say the 1,500 deer on the reservation are
more than the area can feed, and the hunt is intended to reduce the
population by 80 does. Officials have cited more than 100 traffic
accidents involving deer around the academy in the last year to
argue that the growing deer population poses a danger to the public.

   Deborah Miller became a grandmother one
day and a mother the next.
   Miller gave birth to her third child, Michael, at 5 p.m.
Thursday at Reid Memorial Hospital. Eighteen hours earlier, her
oldest daughter, Amanda Beasley, gave birth to her first child,
Alyssa.
   By Friday, they were sharing a room at the hospital.
   ``We knew it would be possible to be close,'' Miller said. ``But
when we were both overdue, we didn't know what was going to
happen.''
   Miller's due date was Oct. 2, her 20-year-old daughter's was
Sept. 27.
   ``Amanda and I have been so close and shared so much. Sometimes,
I have trouble remembering that I'm a mother first,'' said Miller,
37. ``When other mothers call their girlfriends when they need a
shoulder to cry on, I call my daughter.''
   While Beasley was headed for the birthing room, nurses quipped
the two women might share a room.
   ``We joked about this the whole nine months,'' Miller said.
``But we never thought we'd do it.''

   Bill and Judy Studham were excited
when they had twins four years ago. They were stunned to learn
another set was on the way this year.
   ``At first it was kind of overwhelming, but we are really
excited about it now,'' Mrs. Studham said, who added that twins run
in both sides of the family.
   Andy and Allan are now getting acquainted with their new
brothers, Adam and Aaron. The new twins were born Oct. 8.
   ``I had wanted twins since I was a little girl,'' Mrs. Studham
said.
   ``At first we were really shocked. We intended to have four
children but had wanted only one this time,'' Mrs. Studham said. As
reality set in, the idea was accepted and the family became
ecstatic, she said.
   None of the twins is identical, said their mother.
   ``I like it that way. I can really see their individuality,''
she said.

   To hear Janna VanZile describe it,
Cupid is moonlighting as a postal clerk for the U.S. Navy.
   A letter that she addressed to no particular sailor stationed in
the Persian Gulf found its way to Petty Officer First Class Stephen
A. Woodbury, 25, of Boston, and now they're engaged.
   The pen-pal romance began a year ago, when announcers with
WTCM-AM began asking listeners to write to servicemen in the gulf
as a morale booster.
   VanZile, 23, addressed her letter to any sailor or Marine in the
region. ``I just wrote about myself and the area where I live and
my hobbies,'' she said.
   Woodbury, an intelligence specialist stationed aboard the U.S.S.
LaSalle, received VanZile's letter and wrote back to her shortly
before Christmas. They began corresponding regularly, sometimes
writing two or three letters a day.
   They met in April while Woodbury was on a two-week leave. ``He
called my mom and made arrangements'' to meet, VanZile said. ``I
didn't even know about it.
   The couple hasn't set a wedding date. But VanZile and her
4-year-old daughter, Ashley, are preparing to move to Virginia
Beach, Va., to be near Woodbury, who's stationed in nearby Norfolk.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis courted votes Saturday
in the all-important battlegrounds of California and Texas,
defending his crimefighting record and saying his commitment on the
issue ``comes right from my gut.''
   Dukakis ended a four-day stay in California by accepting the
endorsement of four Hispanic law enforcement groups and then flew
to Texas, where he laid a wreath at a Vietnam veterans memorial in
San Antonio and addressed an outdoor rally.
   In addition to defending his crimefighting record and denouncing
that of Republican rival George Bush, Dukakis delivered tailored
messages in each state. He spoke in Los Angeles of his commitment
to the environment and in San Antonio of his promise of national
energy and banking policies to help struggling industries.
   He also spoke warmly of his running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I have formed a partnership _ a partnership
for the future, a partnership that will make America first
economically and militarily,'' Dukakis told the Texas rally.
   ``The two go hand in hand,'' he said. ``You can't have one
without the other and we'll have neither if we elect George Bush
and Dan Quayle to lead our country.''
   Dukakis also pressed his effort to paint Bush as a failed leader
in the war on drugs who also let down the banking industry in his
adopted home state of Texas and offered no vision of the future.
   ``George Bush offers us the politics of complacency,'' Dukakis
told the rowdy San Antonio gathering. ``Lloyd Bentsen and I offer
the challenge of change. George Bush wants us to stick to the
status quo.''
   Dukakis said Republican corruption and misguided decisions on
defense spending had harmed the nation's conventional strength and
were costing jobs at military installations in Texas.
   ``That's why the Republican era of greed and graft and
corruption is going to end at high noon on the day I take the oath
of office as president of the United States,'' Dukakis said.
   Earlier, at the law-enforcement event, the Democrat spoke of
murders in California by inmates on furlough during Ronald Reagan's
governorship. And he said that while Bush has been vice president
there have been thousands of federal prison furloughs and one
incident last year in which an inmate on furlough raped and
murdered a mother of two in Arizona.
   Polls indicate the Republican vice president has been successful
in attacking Dukakis' crime record by citing a Massachusetts
furlough program that granted a pass to a murderer who later raped
a Maryland woman.
   The Massachusetts governor said it was ``cynical and
hypocritical'' for Bush to use the Massachusetts case for political
gain.
   Dukakis said that he and Reagan took responsibility for their
programs but that Bush has refused to take blame for his failures.
   The governor also spoke of the mugging of his father at the age
of 77 and the death of his brother in a hit-and-run car incident.
   ``I didn't learn my lessons about crime from a Clint Eastwood
movie,'' Dukakis said. ``I've been out there with you.''
   He said Bush had failed in leading the Reagan administration's
drug war, and he drew laughter from the audience when mentioning
Bush's proposal to put his running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle,
in charge of the drug fight.
   ``The only thing, I think, that is cheaper today than it was in
1982 is cocaine,'' Dukakis said, blaming that in part on Bush,
Reagan's point man on drugs.
   He boasted of his state's 14 percent decline in the rate of
major crime, and its rankings as the state with the lowest homicide
rate among industrial states. That progress, he said, resulted from
his personal involvement in a statewide anti-crime council.
   ``This is an issue that is very close to me,'' he said. ``It
comes right out of my gut.''
   Dukakis also tailored part of his message to his California
audience, promising to double the number of federal drug agents and
send the first 100 new agents to southern California.
   ``When southern California and Los Angeles called for help,
where was the administration in Washington? Nowhere to be found,''
Dukakis said. ``It's easy to talk about values. It's a lot tougher
to live up to them. That's really the issue in this campaign, talk
versus action, an understanding of the future.''
   He also spoke Saturday at a birthday tribute to Jesse Jackson,
his former Democratic presidential rival.
   Jackson said, ``The governor has set the pace. He established
the principles. articulated the problems. My friends, Governor
Dukakis can be trustedd to keep hope alive, to build the America of
our dreams.''
   At another rally, Dukakis touched on the environment, another
important issue in California, promising an administration that
supported ``clean air and clean water and clean oceans and clean
government.''

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle ended a week-long swing through the Midwest and Plains
states Saturday, brushing off protesters at a Wisconsin rally and
proclaiming that the state ``is going for George Bush.''
   At a welcome home rally here staged by Vice President George
Bush's staff, Quayle was presented with a green medical uniform
sporting the words ``Dr. Spin'' and a stethoscope.
   Quayle earlier in the week proclaimed himself ``Dr. Spin'' and
said he would be doing his own ``spinning,'' or interpretation for
the press of campaign developments.
   He was greeted in Wisconsin by cheering supporters in Eau Claire
and Appleton.
   However, he also ran into protests at the University of
Wisconsin at Eau Claire. When he arrived, demonstrators held signs
reading ``What has Quayle done for vets?'' and ``Chickenhawk,'' the
latter a reference to his service at home in the Indiana National
Guard during the Vietnam War.
   ``See you after the election,'' Quayle said as he brushed by
them.
   His speech was briefly disrupted by chants of ``Go home Dan.''
   ``That's the kind of courtesy you get from the Dukakis people,''
Quayle said and the crowd cheered.
   Quayle has criticized the Democratic presidential nominee for
failing, when given the opportunity during Thursday night's debate
with Bush, to say something nice about his opponent. On Friday,
Quayle said Dukakis lacked ``common courtesy.''
   He told the Wisconsin rallies that Bush ``won that debate hands
down.''
   In Appleton, where escape artist Harry Houdini was born, Quayle
joked that Dukakis ``failed miserably'' in ``every escape trick he
tried.''
   Quayle's campaign trips this week took him through Michigan,
Ohio, Indiana, South Dakota, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Wisconsin.
   But the week was most notable for Quayle's statements Wednesday
that he was going to be ``my own handler'' and was taking more
control of his campaign. He said that as someone who has run
successfully for elective office in the past, ``I know what's best
for George Bush.''
   He was reacting to numerous reports that his words and actions
are tightly controlled by Bush campaign officials fearful of what
he might say or do on his own.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II told visiting American
bishops Saturday that Roman Catholic colleges and universities in
the United States must be faithful to church doctrine.
   John Paul said the teachings of the church ``can truly be
considered the expression of the infallibility of the church.
   ``Yet this does not prevent the church from recognizing and
promoting a legitimate pluralism in theology.''
   But, he said, that pluralism is ``limited to the unity of the
faith and the authentic teachings of the church.''
   The pope spoke of the ``importance Catholic higher education has
for the future of society and the church in the United States,''
but added, the ``degree of their influence depends entirely on the
preservation of their Catholic identity.''
   John Paul also referred to what he called the ``damaging
repercussions'' of the ``right to dissent'' on moral conduct.
   ``It is not the conscience that establishes liberally what is
right and what is wrong,'' he said.

<HEAD>Animal Rights Group Claims Responsibility in Attacking Trainer
Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical animal rights group claimed
responsibility for defacing the homes and cars of three trainers
involved in the disciplinary beating of a zoo elephant.
   Members of the Animal Liberation Front poured red paint on the
trainers' cars, let air out of their tires and splashed their homes
with abrasive paint-stripping chemicals either early Friday or late
Thursday night, said Nancy Burnet, director of the Coalition to
Protect Animals in Entertainment.
   The dispute that has been broiling since February over the
chaining and beating of the animal has included investigations by
the local and national Humane Society, the city attorney's office
and the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums.
   Burnet, who said she does not belong to the Animal Liberation
Front but supports its action, told The Associated Press she
received a call from a group member Friday claiming responsibility
for the vandalism.
   The trainers were all employees of the San Diego Zoological
Society, said San Diego Zoo spokeswoman Martha Baker. No one was
injured in the episode, she said.
   ``We are outraged that the victims and their families have been
terrorized in such a manner,'' said Doug Myers, executive director
of the zoological society, which operates the zoo and affiliated
Wild Animal Park. ``Personally attacking our employees is purely
reprehensible.''
   In a statement released through Burnet, the group said its acts
were in response to the trainers' handling of Dunda, an 18-year-old
African elephant at the Wild Animal Park near Escondido in northern
San Diego County.
   When Dunda was transferred from the zoo to the Wild Animal Park
in February, the trainers reported that she became unruly and at
one point acted like she was trying to kill them.
   To prevent the elephant from getting out of control, the
trainers said they had to chain the animal and beat her repeatedly
with wooden sticks.
   The Zoological Society defended the trainers' actions, saying
they took the necessary steps to regain control of Dunda. Others
have criticized the form of discipline, including several park
employees who witnessed it.
   The national Humane Society called the beating an isolated case
of animal abuse, but left any changes in the handling of elephants
to the Zoological Society's discretion. The local Humane Society
and the city attorney's office, cleared the zoo of abuse
allegations.
   In response to the situation, the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums created a task force to set
nationwide elephant training standards considered later by its
board of directors. Last month, the group ruled the San Diego
trainers did not violate ethical standards.

<HEAD>Chrysler Chairman To Chinese: Improve Quality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca on
Saturday told his Chinese partners they must improve quality in
order to compete in the international auto market.
   ``Mostly we talked straight about quality,'' Iacocca said of his
discussions with Beijing Jeep Corp., which is 31 percent owned by
Chrysler.
   ``You must get quality up. Quality comes up, productivity comes
up, costs go down and the world will recognize you as an exporter.
If you don't do that, you can't play,'' Iacocca said.
   He told a news conference that another key problem was getting
enough foreign exchange to increase volume to the level where
world-class quality suppliers will invest in the company.
   ``If there was one single thing we tried to emphasize this week
it was we must prime the pump somewhat to get some volume going,''
he said.
   Beijing Jeep, a joint venture begun in 1983 between American
Motors Corp. and the Beijing Automobile Works, shut down its
assembly lines and almost collapsed in 1986 because it lacked
foreign currency to buy needed parts.
   The Chinese government bailed out the enterprise, which this
year will produce about 4,000 Jeep Cherokees and 25,500 light-duty
four-wheel-drive jeeps called the BJ212.
   Chrysler took over AMC's share of the business when it bought
the company last year.
   Iacocca said production of the Cherokee must be increased to
10,000 and then 15,000 vehicles in the coming years to make the
operation more viable.
   He also emphasized quality, a persistent problem in China, in a
speech before 300 Chinese businessmen and officials in the Great
Hall of the People.
   ``The price of entry in the international automobile market is
quality,'' he said. ``If you don't have the best product in its
class, don't try to compete.''
   He urged Chinese automakers to develop their own market before
exporting. China last year produced 472,000 vehicles, almost all
trucks and buses, and has outlined ambitious plans for rapid
expansion.
   Its passenger car industry, just getting off the ground, so far
has been based entirely on joint ventures, with Chrysler producing
in Beijing, Volkswagen in Shanghai and Peugeot in Canton.
   Iacocca, who celebrated his 64th birthday Saturday, arrived
Monday for his first trip to China.

   A pressroom fire at The San Diego Union early
Saturday forced editors to put out a thinner and delayed version of
the newspaper.
   About 150 to 200 people were evacuated from the building when
the fire broke out at 1:15 a.m. in one of four presses churning out
the morning newspaper, said fire Battalion Chief Russell Loughy.
   A sprinkler system extinguished the fire in minutes and nobody
was injured, but two presses were knocked out of service, said Bob
Robinson, assistant general manager of the Union-Tribune Publishing
Co.
   About 70,000 copies were printed before the fire and were
distributed on time, but a pared-down version printed on two
presses went out several hours late to about 200,000 readers, he
said.
   Water, smoke and fire damage was estimated at $2.5 million, the
majority to pressroom equipment, said fire Capt. Ralph Carrizosa.
   The fire was attributed to a worn-out part in one of the
presses, which overheated and ignited scraps of newsprint, Robinson
said.

   The government newspaper said Satuday
that an Egyptian novelist won this year's Nobel Prize for
literature becuase he supported the peace accord between Egypt and
Israel.
   ``Finally an Arab writer has won the Nobel Prize,'' the paper,
Al-thawra, said. ``We wish he had not. Because it would have been
better for him and more honorable for us.''
   The Swedish Academy on Thursday named Egyptian novelist Neguib
Mahfouz for the literature award. It was the first time an Arab
writer has won the prize.
   Mahfouz supported the Camp David peace treaty signed in 1979 by
the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin, then
Israel's prime minister. Sadat and Begin subsequently were awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Syria is a bitter critic of the U.S.-brokered peace pact and has
attacked the awards to Sadat and Begin.
   Describing the literature prize as ``Western bait,'' Al-thawra
said its ``significance is to tell Arab writers `get dirty in the
swamp of Camp David as a dissident like Neguib Mahfouz and you will
get the award.'''

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blanca Nunez del Arco is back home after
traveling to the United States to campaign for her ``American son
Miguel'' _ Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   In an interview Saturday at her home in suburban Lima she said
of her trip last month to New Jersey: ``I wore campaign buttons. I
went to the stores and shops and said `Dukakis _ Yes!''' She spoke
in Spanish but said ``Dukakis _ Yes!'' in English.
   She said Dukakis spoke Spanish ``very well'' when he lived with
her family in Lima for eight months while he was a university
exchange student in 1954 and 1955.
   ``From the first moment I treated him as if he were my own
son,'' she told The Associated Press.
   The Massachusetts governor has occasionally referred to his stay
in Peru during the presidential campaign against Republican Vice
President George Bush, and has used his facility with the Spanish
language to address Hispanic audiences along the campaign trail.
   The Nunez del Arco ``family represents a lot to me as does the
Peruvian family in general,'' Dukakis was quoted as saying in a
recent interview in Noticias del Mundo, a Spanish-language
newspaper in New York.
   Mrs. Nunez del Arco's comments offered a new glimpse of the
54-year-old candidate's more formative years.
   Speaking of Dukakis' stay in Lima, she said, ``He was very
intelligent, very thoughtful.... He wanted to learn everything
about the world, especially the problems of Latin America.''
   ``I explained the little that I knew,'' she said.
   Mrs. Nunez del Arco denied allegations in the local press that
Dukakis led a Bohemian life in Lima and once went to see but did
not enter a famous brothel in La Victoria, a rough section of Lima.
   ``It is all lies. He did go to La Victoria, but he went with me
to visit the shantytowns,'' she said.
   Mrs. Nunez del Arco said she did part-time social work in the
slums and Dukakis went with her on several occasions after he
expressed an interest in understanding the problems of the poor.
   She described Dukakis as a serious young man but affectionate.
``He definitely is serious ... He knows what he thinks and tells
the truth. ... With me Miguel was never cold. He was always very
affectionate.''
   She said that she and her husband Victor, a retired lawyer, and
three of their children were greeted with ``open arms'' by Dukakis
when they arrived in New Jersey on Sept. 26.
   She recalled that Dukakis told them, ``Here are my Peruvian
parents. It's an emotional moment to have you at my side.''
   Dukakis studied political science and Spanish at San Marcos
University in downtown Lima.
   Mrs. Nunez del Arco said Dukakis had little time for socializing
while in Lima. She said he was busy with classes and his studies,
frequent trips with family members around the city and lengthy
chats with her about Latin America.
   ``He was like an older brother to the children,'' she said,
noting that her six children then ranged in age from 7 to 13. She
jokingly refused to give her age.
   Mrs. Nunez del Arco said Dukakis has written to her family
several times a year since his visit to Peru and two of her
children had stayed with the Dukakis family.
   ``I have a lot of faith in Miguel,'' she said. ``His country and
all countries are going to be better off with Dukakis. He has a
great sense of social responsibility.''

   Richard Ruffner, 36, of Windeer, Pa., and William Evans, 36,
drowned, police said. Evans' Pennsylvania hometown was not
immediately known.
   Keith Schuyler, 44, of Muncy, Pa., was missing and presumed
drowned.
   The trio set out in a 15-foot boat to go fishing, police said.
Authorities said they believed high winds and rough water caused
the vessel to sink late Friday.

<TEXT>
   The huge accommodation module of the
oil rig that exploded and burned in July was hauled Saturday from
the North Sea to be searched for 112 bodies still missing from the
world's worst oilfield disaster.
   When the Piper Alpha oil rig exploded in flames on July 6, 167
workers perished and most of the bodies were not recovered.
   It is believed many may be in the accommodation unit where
workers had their living quarters.
   In silence and gathering fog, the 1,000-ton steel structure the
size of a four-story building emerged from the sea hoisted by
cranes, water pouring from drainage holes drilled in its sides by
divers.
   There were no cheers from the 400 offshore oilfield workers who
took part in the operation 120 miles from Scotland's northeastern
coast.
   A spokesman for Occidental Petroleum Corp., the Piper Alpha
owner, said the module would be secured to a giant barge for
transport to calm waters in the Orkney Islands. The journey is
expected to take two days. Once there, 40 police officers will
search for bodies.
   Police said relatives would be spared the distress of
identifying the bodies and the remains will be flown to Aberdeen
for identification.
   The module had been upside-down almost 500 feet below the
surface of the sea.
   The module, big enough to contain a movie theater and gymnasium,
was to be welded to a barge for its final journey to the Flotta
terminal, 130 miles away in the Orkneys, said Occidental spokesman
Alex Blake-Milton.
   A smaller accommodation module from the oil rig platform was
lifted from the seabed Tuesday but no bodies were found inside.
   John Brading, Occidental's chief executive for Britain, said:
``The successful completion of this complex lifting operation will,
I am sure, bring great relief to the relatives of the missing men
as well as to the offshore crews who have been directly involved
with the task.''

   The Health Ministry ordered the removal of a plasma
substitute from hospitals Saturday following the deaths of four
people who had been treated with it, the Italian news agency ANSA
reported.
   The ministry emphasized the removal was ``preventative.''
   It said in a communique that four men had died at the Lancisi
Hospital in the northern city of Ancona after receiving the
Italian-made plasma substitute Hespan prior to heart operations.
   The patients, aged from 48 to 68, died over a one-month period,
the medical director of Ancona hospitals and the president of the
national medical workers' organization said Saturday at a news
conference, according to ANSA.
   The patients, who received the plasma substitute because of
heart circulation problems, suffered a sudden drop in blood
pressure before their deaths, the officials said.
   The assistant prosecutor of Ancona, Marcello Monteleone, ordered
the patients' records seized, ANSA said. Monteleone said it was not
yet clear what caused the four deaths and said they could have
resulted from technical problems or the action of other drugs.

   Two more staff members were charged with
murder Saturday in the beating death of the 8-year-old daughter of
the leader of a Los Angeles group organized to help disadvantaged
inner-city children.
   Fifty-three other children, possibly victims of abuse, were put
in state custody after the death Friday of Dayna Lorea Broussard.
   The girl's father, Eldridge Broussard Jr., is the leader of the
Watts Christian Center and founder of the Ecclesia Athletic
Association, intended to train and discipline youngsters in the
Watts area of Los Angeles.
   The dead child was beaten on her head, chest and extremities and
died of ``multiple blunt-force injuries,'' said state Medical
Examiner Larry V. Lewman.
   The three charged with murder were connected to Broussard's
group, Clackamas County sheriff's spokeswoman Judy Gage said
Saturday.
   Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego, was charged Friday and
held without bail in the county jail. Charged Saturday were
Constance Zipporah Jackson, 37, and Frederick Paul Doolittle, 28,
both of Los Angeles. They were jailed pending arraignment Monday.
Chambers is the father of a student at the center.
   The 53 children, aged 3 months to 16 years and all reportedly
from Los Angeles, were taken by state authorities from a farm house
eight miles east of Sandy and placed in juvenile shelters and
foster homes.
   Capt. Pat Detloff of the sheriff's department said several of
the children had old scars that indicated they may have been
physically abused.
   ``All the children were given a preliminary medical
assessment,'' Bart Wilson, branch manager for the state Childrens
Services Division, said Saturday. ``All I know is that nobody has
any serious injuries or anything, but that's a pretty speculative
statement.''
   He said the children would be examined and interviewed over the
weekend.
   Gage said Jackson and Doolittle were with the children in the
sparsely furnished house at the time authorities arrived.
Investigators said the children were sleeping on pillows on the
floor.
   Officials said Chambers and three other adults brought the dead
child to a fire station in a rural area 25 miles east of Portland
early Friday.
   The three adults who accompanied Chambers, and who also were
connected with Broussard's group, were charged with hindering
prosecution and jailed in lieu of $100,000 bail each.
   Alvin Broussard, reached by telephone at the Watts center
Saturday, said his brother left Los Angeles by car late Friday en
route to Oregon.
   Eldridge Broussard, 35, was a star basketball player at Pacific
University in Forest Grove, Ore., in the 1970s. He founded the
controversial athletic association in 1975. The organization
brought an estimated 70 to 100 men, women and children from Los
Angeles to the Sandy area in April 1987. Broussard said they were
there to grow vegetables and train, especially for Olympic-style
games he hoped to one day establish in Africa.
   The group left the area, returning to Los Angeles in June 1987
after neighbors opposed Ecclesia's applications for zoning permits
to allow 55 children and 45 adults to live in tents and use
portable toilets and showers.
   The children reportedly had been in the area since late summer.
   Carolyn Van Brunt, a spokeswoman for Broussard, said Friday
night from Los Angeles that the group sometimes uses ``physical
correcton'' as a form of discipline, but denied the punishment was
cruel.
   ``These kids are from Watts and they have to deal with gangs and
drugs and people with no discipline,'' she said.
   ``The staff members, the volunteers, are certainly dismayed at
this very unfortunate occurrence,'' she added. ``But no one's
holding any grudge against anyone. Somebody made a mistake.''

<TEXT>
   A U.N. official said Saturday that if the
United States withholds some of the dues President Reagan promised
to pay, it would threaten an independence plan for South-West
Africa and other peacekeeping missions.
   The United States paid $85.6 million Friday, reducing the
American arrears to the regular budget to $366.3 million.
   U.N. officials refused to confirm or deny a report published
Saturday by The New York Times that said the United States would
withhold $59 million of $188 million Reagan pledged to pay by the
end of the year.
   The report said the funds would be frozen until the General
Assembly's main financial committee, the Fifth Committee, adopts an
austerity budget recommended last month by a subcommittee.
   U.N. financial spokesman Fred Eckhard said Saturday that if the
U.S. withheld dues it would be ``a disappointment,'' and impinge on
some U.N. peacekeeping missions.
   Caroline Dulin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, said the administration had no reaction to the reports.
   On Sept. 13, Reagan announced he would release $188 million in
unpaid American dues, saying he was satisfied with the U.N.'s
progress on budgetary and other reforms and approved the payment.
   But ever since Reagan took office eight years ago his
administration has harshly criticized the United Nations for what
it calls anti-Western bias, bureaucracy and waste, and has withheld
$700 million in dues to the regular budget, peacekeeping forces and
U.N. agencies.
   Eckhard pointed out that South Africa, Cuba and Angola have
approved Nov. 1 as the date on which the United Nations can begin
implementing an independence plan for South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   The independence plan is estimated to cost $600 million to $700
million for one year, and Eckhard said the United Nations would
need $100 million to $200 million up front to launch the plan _
funds the world body doesn't have.
   The United Nations has no reserve funds, and operates by
spending dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them.
   Eckhard said the United Nations has so far only collected a
fraction of the $35.7 million it assessed members for the first
quarter of a peacekeeping mission in the Persian Gulf.
   Another peacekeeping operation that may require U.N. funds is a
proposal to send 2,000 observers to the Western Sahara to monitor a
referendum on independence for the region.

   Passengers from about 60 Northwest Airlines
flights over the last month were being sought Saturday as health
officials tried to identify the source of an illness that may have
stricken hundreds of people.
   Laboratory tests have confirmed cases of the bacterial illness
shigellosis in passengers from five Northwest flights, and
officials have received calls from passengers on about 60 flights
between Sept. 15 and Oct. 10 who say they suffered symptoms that
may be those of shigellosis, said state Health Department spokesman
Buddy Ferguson.
   The outbreak came to light after 21 players and staff members of
the Minnesota Vikings football team became acutely ill two to five
days after their game in Miami Oct. 2. State epidemiologist Michael
Osterholm said the Vikings, some of their family members and two
Miami locker room workers became ill after eating catered
sandwiches after the game and in the following days.
   Shigellosis is an intestinal infection that causes intense
diarrhea and other symptoms that can last for five to seven days.
The illness spreads easily from person to person.
   All the illnesses confirmed so far have been traced to food
prepared in Marriott Corp.'s airline kitchen at the Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport. The facility prepares 100,000 meals a
week for Northwest.
   ``We're into a phase where we're trying to deal with some of the
reports we've gotten in from the public about becoming ill, and
trying to determine whether those are probable cases of
shigellosis,'' Ferguson said.

   A 2-year-old boy who climbed from his crib,
walked outside and fell into a canal was kept from drowning when
his pajamas trapped air and kept his face bobbing above water.
   His mother heard the screams and pulled Albert Joseph out with
help from the family dog, a mixed breed named Lady, who also jumped
into the water, said the boy's grandmother, M.I. Dunn.
   Ms. Dunn said the boy's mother, Patricia Joseph, was sleeping
when the child woke up about 8 a.m. Friday.
   ``He climbed out of the crib, opened up the door and went out,''
Ms. Dunn said. ``Usually he comes to me.''
   Albert Joseph padded into the back yard, which is bordered by an
unfenced canal up to 15 feet deep, and fell in.
   His zippered pajamas trapped the air, keeping his face above
water, said paramedic Mark Von Stein.
   ``He was very lucky. There are very slim chances of something
like this ever happening,'' said Von Stein.

<HEAD>Scholars Conclude Jesus Didn't Write, May Not Have Used, Lord's
Prayer</HEAD>

Jesus did use the word ``Abba''. Picks up 3rd graf, `The

<TEXT>
   Jesus probably didn't write or use the Lord's
Prayer and may have uttered only a few of the phrases it contains,
a group of biblical and linguistic scholars has concluded at a
conference.
   The group was in general agreement, however, that Jesus did use
the word ``Abba,'' or ``Father,'' which was considered radical in
his day. It was the only part of the prayer nearly all of the
scholars agreed that Jesus certainly used. Theologians attatch
great weight to the ``Abba'' issue.
   The group acknowledges the prospect of a fundamentalist uproar
over their conclusions but say that doesn't bother them.
   The prayer shows up in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, which
say Jesus taught it to his disciples.
   The 25 participants of the Jesus Seminar, meeting in Atlanta
over the weekend, agreed with a Pennsylvania minister who
researched the issue that Jesus probably didn't ask God to
``deliver us from evil,'' and almost certainly never said ``Thy
kingdom come, thy will be done.''
   A paper presented Friday by the Rev. Hal Taussig of St. Joseph's
University in Philadelphia concludes that study of the Gospels and
early Christian writings show the prayer is not in the words of
Jesus.
   The participants voted to agree with Taussig that Jesus probably
never said the prayer as a prayer and probably never taught it as
one.
   They concluded that parts of the prayer may have been said by
Jesus and that other parts represented his ideas.
   Taussig said he expects the conclusions to be accepted by
biblical scholars but that it might be harder to convince most
churches.
   The Jesus Seminar is a 3-year-old forum designed to raise public
interest in efforts to separate what Jesus actually said from words
that may have been put in his mouth by early Christians.
   The participants, from colleges and universities around the
country, generally characterize themselves as biblical scholars
rather than theologians.
   The seminar, which convened here Friday, has drawn fire from
``the Bible-thumpers on the right,'' said Dr. Robert W. Funk, a
former theology professor at Emory University and founder of the
Jesus Seminar.
   He said a main goal of the seminar is to allow qualified
biblical scholars to relate their work to issues of public interest
``and to get it away from the frauds, the TV evangelists who are
mostly quacks.''
   The scholars have spent years studying the earliest available
versions of the Gospels in Greek and Coptic. Some know Aramaic,
which scholars say Jesus probably spoke.
   By superimposing early language patterns on what is known of how
people lived at the time of Jesus and later during the early
Christian era, the scholars believe they can make fairly sound
decisions on what was said and what was attributed by others.
   Funk said the earliest fragment of the Gospels dates from about
125 A.D. and that there are frequent changes in subsequent
versions, since each was hand copied.
   Versions began to stabilize by around 400 A.D., he said. ``There
were no big surprises after that.''
   Funk said the earliest Greek and Coptic versions of the Gospels
of Matthew, Mark and Luke are inconsistent with modern versions and
the life and customs as they were known to be at the time of Jesus.
   ``For example, the early Christian church borrowed heavily from
Jewish practices and customs and attributed some of those to
Jesus,'' Funk said.
   ``Of course, we haven't drawn anything like `The Last Temptation
of Christ,''' he said, referring to the controversial movie. But he
said he expected an angry reaction from segments of the
fundamentalist community that believe in a literal interpretation
of the New Testament.
   If they don't react to it, he said, the study may not get much
attention.
   The seminar also concluded that Jesus created the tale of the
Good Samaritan but decided that the parable of the fisherman who
sorts good fish from bad was created later by someone else.

   A U.N. official said Saturday that if the
United States withholds some of the dues President Reagan promised
to pay, it would threaten an independence plan for South-West
Africa and other peacekeeping missions.
   The United States paid $85.6 million Friday, reducing the
American arrears to the regular budget to $366.3 million.
   U.N. officials refused to confirm or deny a report published
Saturday by The New York Times that said the United States would
withhold $59 million of $188 million Reagan pledged to pay by the
end of the year.
   The report said the funds would be frozen until the General
Assembly's main financial committee, the Fifth Committee, adopts an
austerity budget recommended last month by a subcommittee.
   U.N. financial spokesman Fred Eckhard said Saturday that if the
U.S. withheld dues it would be ``a disappointment,'' and impinge on
some U.N. peacekeeping missions.
   Caroline Dulin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, said the administration had no reaction to the reports.
   On Sept. 13, Reagan announced he would release $188 million in
unpaid American dues, saying he was satisfied with the U.N.'s
progress on budgetary and other reforms and approved the payment.
   But ever since Reagan took office eight years ago his
administration has harshly criticized the United Nations for what
it calls anti-Western bias, bureaucracy and waste, and has withheld
$700 million in dues to the regular budget, peacekeeping forces and
U.N. agencies.
   Eckhard pointed out that South Africa, Cuba and Angola have
approved Nov. 1 as the date on which the United Nations can begin
implementing an independence plan for South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   The independence plan is estimated to cost $600 million to $700
million for one year, and Eckhard said the United Nations would
need $100 million to $200 million up front to launch the plan _
funds the world body doesn't have.
   The United Nations has no reserve funds, and operates by
spending dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them.
   Eckhard said the United Nations has so far only collected a
fraction of the $35.7 million it assessed members for the first
quarter of a peacekeeping mission in the Persian Gulf.
   Another peacekeeping operation that may require U.N. funds is a
proposal to send 2,000 observers to the Western Sahara to monitor a
referendum on independence for the region.

<TEXT>
   Time is running out for three California
gray whales trapped in the thickening ice of the Arctic Ocean, and
the discussion Saturday was turning from rescue to humane
destruction.
   The young whales have been stranded for more than a week by new
ice about 18 miles northeast of this Inupiat Eskimo community. The
mammals are in shallow water only a few hundred feet offshore,
where they have been rising to the surface every couple of minutes
to breath through small _ and shrinking _ holes in the ice.
   They are four to five miles from open water.
   ``The ice around the whales has become pretty solid,'' said
Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist with the North Slope Borough.
``You can walk right up to the edge and take a look.
   ``They've been bumping up against the ice and their heads are
scraped and cut. Taking a closer look at them, I don't think they
have more than a week or so to go,'' Carroll said.
   Biologists have said they feared the breathing holes could
freeze over or be slammed shut by the drifting ice.
   ``The wind had kind of changed yesterday, coming more from the
northwest, which isn't good,'' Carroll said. ``That could close the
major lead and if that closes, then all our (rescue) efforts are
pretty futile.''
   No icebreaking vessels are closer than 200 miles, and
suggestions ranging from blasting a trail through the ice to the
open sea, or tranquilizing the whales to somehow move them to
freedom have been discussed and discarded, biologists said.
   The Alaska Army National Guard, meanwhile, authorized the use
Saturday of a huge Skycrane helicopter which is capable of lifting
up to 25,000 pounds of cargo.
   The helicopter is to be used to transport a ``hoverbarge'' from
the Prudhoe Bay oilfields to where the whales are trapped near
Barrow, a distance of about 200 miles, said Mike Haller, a guard
spokesman.
   ``We'll be heading north at first light tomorrow,'' Haller said.
``It probably will take us all day to move from here (Anchorage) to
Prudhoe. Then we'll go to work to get the barge to Barrow. We could
be there sometime Monday afternoon.''
   If things go as planned, the icebreaking barge would be used to
clear a path to open water, Haller said.
   ``We don't know how much time we have, but we understand it's
(situation) getting pretty critical,'' Haller said.
   The people in Barrow, who harvest a small number of larger
bowhead whales each season for food and other uses, have begun
talking about the possibility of killing the whales if they remain
trapped much longer.
   ``I don't want to make any attempt to speak for everybody up
here, but couple of (whaling) boat captains I talked to said if the
whales can't be gotten out of the ice, they'd hate to watch them
suffer,'' Carroll said.
   ``They'd rather quickly and efficiently put them out of their
misery than watch them die a slow and agonizing death. With the
stress they've been under, the meat's not going to be of a very
good quality, anyway.
   ``It's a desire to put them out of their misery rather than an
attempt to harvest them,'' Carroll said.
   Arnold Brower, a village elder and whaling captain, said
community leaders want to meet with government officials this
weekend to sort out the options.
   ``It looks like they haven't rested for a long period of time,''
Brower said. ``They're struggling there. They're just like we are,
fighting for survival.
   ``We have to do something. Decide to put them to sleep or help
them out.''
   Gray whales generally spend their summers feeding in the
Beaufort Sea off Alaska's North Slope, then migrate south through
the Bering Strait in the fall.
   They spend their winters in the warm waters off Mexico and
Southern California.

   Reuben Feinberg thanked the doctors who saved his
life through heart surgery by giving $17 million to the
Northwestern University Medical School.
   Feinberg, whose father, Joseph, died of heart disease, is
donating the money to establish a cardiovascular research center.
   The donation, from the Joseph and Bessie Feinberg Foundation in
Chicago, is the third largest single gift ever made to the school,
said University President Arnold R. Weber.
   Feinberg said he first approached medical school doctors about
making a major donation while recovering from heart surgery last
year at Northwestern University Memorial Hospital.
   ``I never had thought about giving money to a hospital before
then,'' said Feinberg, 70, who is president and director of the
Jefferson State Bank in Chicago.
   ``I was thinking more about a building or something. But bricks
don't accomplish much. People can.''

   George Bush, vowing to ``go the extra
mile to fight hard'' in the closing weeks of the presidential race,
campaigned Saturday with Hollywood stars and time-tested attacks on
Democratic rival Michael Dukakis.
   Fighting for an advantage in California, where the contest is
too close to call, Bush rode down state highway 99 on a bus tour
through the San Joaquin Valley, trying to energize Republicans and
win over Democrats who had put their allegiance aside to vote for
President Reagan.
   ``California could well be the single key to this election,''
Bush told hundreds of people gathered for a Main Street rally in
Ripon, population 6,700.
   As his caravan rolled past highway crowds, Bush's wife Barbara
prompted him to stick his head out the right window and wave. Son
Jeb Bush, spotting a larger crowd on the left, called out, ``Dad,
you ought to get on the other side.'' He promptly switched.
   ``Here we go ... entering the home stretch of this national
presidential election,'' Bush declared earlier at a noisy kickoff
rally in an airport hangar in Modesto. He pledged to ``redouble our
efforts for the next 24 days'' and ``go the extra mile to fight
hard.''
   ``We're going to take the high road and leave the pessimism and
the tearing down of America to somebody else.''
   Stressing differences with Dukakis, Bush told crowds he supports
voluntary prayer in public schools, and recitation of the Pledge of
Allegiance. ``I don't believe we need more federal gun control. I
don't want somebody from Harvard telling me what I can do and what
I can't do,'' Bush said.
   Bush was accompanied by actors Telly Savalas and Chuck Norris
and by Beach Boys singers Mike Love and Bruce Johnston.
   The vice president closed his daylong trip with a tailgate party
at Fresno State University, where its Bulldogs met Utah State in a
football game. He told the picnicing crowd, ``I'm absolutely
confident that if I can win the state of California I will be the
next president of the United States.''
   From Fresno, Bush was flying to Denver where he planned to spend
two nights.
   At the start of the day, Bush told reporters on Air Force Two
that he was going to stick with familiar themes and not do anything
new that might jeopardize the lead that polls indicate he has.
   ``I'm not going to mess up,'' Bush said. ``Might make a mistake
about Pearl Harbor but I'm not going to mess up.'' In a
well-publicized blooper, he mistakenly said last month that the
anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was Sept. 7
instead of Dec. 7.
   ``My sense is that we seem to be moving in the right direction
but keep on going,'' Bush said. ``I don't think you'll see any
change in game plan or anything of that nature.''
   He said his campaign theme Saturday was ``no different than any
other day.''
   Insisting ``there is not one scintilla of overconfidence in my
makeup,'' Bush said, ``we're going to drive right down to the
wire.''
   He said Dukakis ``is not going to out-hustle me, outwork me.''
   Refusing to speculate about victory, Bush said, ``I can't look
back and I can't look forward beyond Nov. 8, either.''
   He said he was locked into a ``unifocus.''
   ``You're talking to a guy that maybe even some here thought was
out of the race from time to time,'' he said, asking why he should
``now turn around and think everything is roses.''
   Asked if he had a plan to help the battered savings and loan
industry, Bush said ``nobody knows'' how much it will cost
taxpayers for a bailout.
   ``It would be a good place to start and reassure the depositors
that they are in no jeopardy at all,'' Bush said. Told that Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole had estimated it might cost the
government as much as $50 billion, Bush said, ``I have no plan for
a $50 billion bailout.''
   Some analysts have suggested a merger of the well-financed
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., but Bush said, ``I don't believe we need to do
that right now. We need to keep working out of the difficulties and
be sure that the funds are available for these takeovers and to
protect the depositors, above all.''

<TEXT>
   Uniformed men identifying
themselves as soldiers took four young peasants from their homes,
tied them up, shot them in the head and left their bodies laid out
in a row, relatives said Saturday.
   The relatives said the men who came to the village Friday night
identified their unit as the 1st Army Brigade and said they were
``just carrying out orders.''
   The allegations came only weeks after an incident in which
soldiers allegedly massacred 10 peasants in the San Vicente
province. The soldiers accused the peasants of collaborating with
leftist guerrillas who are at war with the U.S-backed government.
   A federal judge issued arrest warrants Thursday for four
soldiers implicated in those killings, but there have been no
arrests.
   Army spokesman Lt. Ricardo Mendoza said the military had no
information on the latest incident in the village of Tres Ceibas,
11 miles north of San Salvador.
   Alfonso Ayala, a judiciary official at the scene, called the
killings ``executions.''
   ``Uniformed men took away and killed my son. They said they were
from the 1st (Army) Brigade,'' said Mario Chavarria Flores, the
father of Cornelio Marroquin, 25.
   In addition to Cornelio Marroquin, relatives said the dead
included Oscar Marroquin, 19, Pedro Marroquin, 20 and Gertrudis
Rivera, 25. The three Marroquins are distant relatives.
   The relatives said the four were not partisans of either side in
the 9-year civil war, which has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives.
   The relatives said several men in army uniforms came to this
isolated hamlet at about 10 p.m. Friday.
   The men knocked on the doors of several houses, asking for
people by name, the villagers said. The four they found were then
bound by the thumbs and marched off, the relatives said.
   Minutes later, the relatives heard gunshots.
   They found the bodies laid in a row about 30 yards from the
homes. All had been shot in the head.
   Chavarria said he tried to follow when the men took away his
son, ``but they shot over my head and told me to look for him
tomorrow (Saturday) at the 1st Brigade.''
   ``I felt so powerless. But they had their guns pointed at me,
and what could I do?'' said Chavarria, his face lined with tears.
   In the Sept. 21 incident in San Francisco in San Vicente
province, the killers wore Jiboa Battalion insignia and were
readily identified as such by dozens of witnesses. The army
acknowledged Jiboa soldiers were operating in the village the day
of the killings.
   Rebels sometimes kill civilians suspected of collaborating with
the armed forces, but they usually claim responsibility for such
actions.
   The armed forces and rightist death squads were blamed for
widespread human rights violations in El Salvador in the late 1970s
and early 1980s. The situation improved over the last few years,
but human rights organizations say political murders are on the
rise again.

   The Amnesty International human
rights concert tour, which began six weeks ago in London, concluded
Saturday in this capital before 70,000 fans.
   Rock stars Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Tracy Chapman, Youssou
N'Dour and Peter Gabriel joined Argentine singers Charly Garcia and
Leon Gieco in the concert at River Plate soccer stadium with ``Get
Up, Stand Up,'' the reggae song by the late Jamaican singer Bob
Marley.
   In all, more than 1 million people turned out in 19 cities on
five continents to hear the performers explain the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, endorse Amnesty International and, of
course, sing.
   ``We look forward to reaching billions of people'' with the Dec.
10 worldwide telecast of Saturday's concert, said John Healey,
executive director of Amnesty International USA.
   ``I'm here for both the music and the message,'' said Vanesa
Gonzalez, 18, of Buenos Aires. ``I'd heard of the declaration
before and I think this is a good way to let others know about it.''
   The declaration, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1948,
says human beings have political, social and economic rights that
no government should curtail and criticizes discrimination based on
race, sex and creed.
   Many in the crowd cheered as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
white shawls covering their heads, marched into the stadium in a
single column.
   The group, which holds weekly marches in a plaza facing
Argentina's Government House, formed to seek the whereabouts of
people who vanished without a trace during military government
repression of suspected leftists in the 1970s.

   NBC on Saturday unveiled its proposal for a new
high-quality television system which the network said could bring
enhanced sound and picture quality into American homes within three
years.
   NBC presented its proposal for production standards for
high-definition television to the Society of Motion Pictures and
Television Engineers at the group's convention Saturday in New York.
   The standards have the backing of a number of U.S. television
makers and ABC-TV, said NBC.
   ``It will not make obsolete the existing 160 million TV sets
Americans now own,'' said NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge.
   High-definition TV produces clearer, brighter images on a wider
TV screen with high-quality sounds. Demand for high-definition
television is expected to grow substantially in the next few years
as picture tubes become larger and screens wider. The advancement
is also seen as a technology to put new life in the American
electronics industry, Rutledge said.
   The Federal Communications Commission last month set preliminary
guidelines to allow research to proceed toward establishing an
American high-definition system. Under the FCC guidelines, a U.S.
system must be able to be received on existing TV sets so current
equipment would not become obsolete. But to receive improved
picture quality, viewers would have to buy a new TV set.
   The FCC's action, Rutledge said, removed a lot of the
``regulatory hoops'' and is expected to facilitate approval of
NBC's proposed standards.
   ``Although technological developments and congressional and
regulatory approval are yet to be completed, the television
industry is hopeful that it can be achieved within three years,''
Rutledge said.
   About 20 advanced-TV systems are under development and competing
to be designated as the U.S. standard.
   The Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers sets
national standards in television production and motion pictures.
   The standards announced by NBC have been endorsed by the ABC-TV
network as well as several television makers, including Zenith and
North American Philips, NBC said.
   Rutledge said NBC had invested some $50 million in the
technology.

   A 4-year-old boy got his arm stuck in a
swimming pool pipe Saturday, and firefighters had to cut the pipe
from the pool to free the child, authorities said.
   Miguel Matthewson was in good condition at Sharp Memorial
Hospital following the ordeal, said nursing supervisor Melanie
Bruce.
   The pipe, believed to about 2{ inches in diameter, was cut from
its pool mechanism and then Miguel, with pipe attached, was taken
to the hospital.
   ``We had to use a saw and a plumber's tool to cut the pipe off
because it was so thick,'' said Ms. Bruce.
   The pipe section was about 10 to 12 inches long, she added.
   Miguel was in the pool for a swimming lesson. His head remained
above water during the rescue operation.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Saturday
urged his country's Roman Catholic leaders to refuse any of the
United States' ``bloodstained'' money.
   Ortega, speaking at a religious festival in Santa Teresa, 35
miles south of Managua, accused Nicaraguan bishops and Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo of becoming ``instruments of Ronald Reagan's
politics of death'' by accepting U.S. funds.
   Tensions between the church and the leftist Sandinista
government have run high in recent days because Obando y Bravo used
U.S. Agency for International Development funds to buy 18 vehicles
for a truce-monitoring commission he heads.
   The commission will monitor a permanent truce between the
government and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels once it is reached.
   The Sandinista government complained it had not given permission
for U.S. money to be used and said the commission has not yet
started working.
   Ortega said Nicaragua's bishops and the cardinal ``are morally
obligated to condemn the Yankee government and not dirty their
hands by taking bloodstained money'' from the United States.

   A couple who won $46 million in
Pennsylvania's 1987 Super 7 Lottery celebrated their good fortune
Saturday night with a dinner party for about 125 people and
fireworks for the whole town.
   Donald R. Woomer Sr. and Linda K. Despot hit the jackpot a year
ago Friday.
   ``We enjoy doing things like this, where you can help in a small
way,'' Ms. Despot, 38, said.
   ``I figure winning that much money, we could do at least that
much for the community, give them a nice fireworks display,''
Woomer, 56, agreed.
   Woomer and Ms. Despot, who live in nearby Hollidaysburg, invited
relatives, neighbors and lottery officials to Saturday night's
dinner at a banquet hall. The couple arrived in a black limousine.
   The dinner guests selected from a buffet of filet mignon,
swordfish, chicken and ham, then enjoyed a half-hour of fireworks
set off at an amusement park.
   Rich Dennis, a disc jockey from a local radio station, played
music from the 1950s and 1960s. It was Dennis who read the winning
numbers for the lottery on Oct. 14, 1987.
   Woomer, a self-employed plasterer prior to Oct. 14, 1987, and
Ms. Despot, a former bookkeeper, began planning the bash last
summer.
   Neither knew how much the evening would end up costing. Neither
one cared.
   ``There's no budget,'' Ms. Despot said. ``If this one goes off
real well, it will be an annual thing.''

<HEAD>Says Soviet Double Agent Reported 1983 War Panic in USSR</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sunday Telegraph reported that a Soviet double
agent who worked for British intelligence for 10 years said that in
1983 the Soviets were convinced the West was about to attack.
   It based its report on excerpts from the book ``The Storm
Birds,'' by Gordon Brooke-Shepherd, which deals with Soviet
defectors.
   The Sunday Telegraph account said that in an interview, Soviet
defector Oleg Gordievski told Brooke-Shepherd that President Reagan
toned down his ``Evil Empire'' approach to the Kremlin after
Gordievski warned about mounting tension in the Soviet leadership.
   The newspaper said Gordievski was the top official of the Soviet
KGB secret police in Britain when he defected in July 1985.
   It said Gordievski passed on warnings about the level of war
panic in the Soviet Union and that led to a change of Western
tactics.
   Gordievski was quoted in ``The Storm Birds'' as saying the
Soviets believed an attack from the West would use military
maneuvers as camouflage and a November 1983 NATO exercise codenamed
Able Archer triggered the panic.
   He also was quoted as saying the Kremlin sent an urgent order to
all KGB agents abroad to report anything that might indicate the
West was preparing to launch a nuclear strike.
   In Britain this involved looking for signs of food stockpiling,
emergency blood banks and noting whether Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher was driving more often than usual to Buckingham Palace,
according to the account.
   Referring to Reagan the book said: ``The White House had, until
then, (Gordievski's warning) fondly believed that, through the
reports to Moscow of men like Anatoly Dobrynin, Soviet ambassador
to Washington over more than two decades, the picture of an
essentially peace-loving and peace-seeking America would have been
presented.
   ``It now transpired that for much of the time, even this
respected veteran had been telling his masters more or less what
they wanted to hear.''
   In an article accompanying the excerpt, Brooke-Shepherd wrote
that Gordievski said it was the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a liberal-communist government that
led to Gordievski's defection after ``a prolonged spiritual and
emotional struggle.''
   The newspaper said Gordievski had been recruited in Copenhagen
in 1974 by British intelligence.
   Brooke-Shepherd wrote that Gordievski was in Moscow in May 1985
when he felt the KGB closing in and he had to escape to Britain.
``The most agonizing decision of his life was to leave behind in
Moscow his wife Leila and their two daughters, Maria and Anna,''
the author wrote.
   ``The Storm Birds'' will be published by Weidenfeld on Oct. 27.

   Some 30,000 homeowners and
businesses in the Buenos Aires area were without phone service
Saturday after thieves stole thousands of yards of telephone cable
from underground channels.
   But phone company officials predicted the thieves would be
disappointed.
   The state-operated National Telecommunications Co. (ENTEL) said
the thieves stole the cable early Saturday in half a dozen suburban
areas apparently believing it was made of copper that could be
melted and sold.
   An ENTEL official said the thieves ``are in for a disagreeable
surprise'' because most of stolen cable was made of glass-based
optical fiber, not copper.
   He said replacement of the cables will take at least a week.

<HEAD>Haitians Seize $6.5 Million Worth of Cocaine With U.S. Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian police working with U.S.
agents on Saturday seized $6.5 million worth of cocaine hidden
aboard a Greek freighter and arrested the ship's owner and crew of
eight, officials said.
   The drugs were found aboard the Aphormajegs, a Greek freighter
sailing under a Panamanian flag, said Maj. Ramus Sainvil, head of
the Haitian Narcotics Bureau. He said 950 pounds of cocaine were
found hidden in small sacks in the mainmast.
   ``This successful operation is a joint effort of the (Haitian)
government and the American Drug Enforcement Administration,''
Sainvil told The Associated Press.
   He said the ship left Venezuela on Sept. 22 with a load of
cement bound for Haiti and arrived in the northern port of St. Marc
on Oct. 8.
   The ship was not allowed to unload and on Saturday morning it
was towed by a U.S. Coast Guard cutter to the Haitian navy dock
yard in Port-au-Prince, Sainvil said.
   ``The cocaine is of high quality,'' said Walter Brown, a U.S.
DEA agent based in Haiti.
   The ship's British owner, identified by police as Allen Knox,
fled the vessel and was arrested in Cap Haitien Friday evening,
Sainvil said. He reported the ship's captain, who he said was a
Greek citizen, is a fugitive, while eight crew members _ four
Chileans and four Greeks _ were arrested.
   In another development, the United States has granted the
Haitian government $200,000 for the purchase of drug detection
equipment, said Susan Clyde, director of the U.S. Information
Service in Port-au-Prince.
   She said two drug-detection centers would be equipped, one in
Cap-Haitien on Haiti's northern coast and another probably in the
western town of Jeremie. She did not specify what kind of equipment
would be provided.

   The Health Ministry, warning of a
possible outbreak of yellow fever and dengue fever, called Saturday
for a clean-up of stagnant water in this capital city.
   Health Minister Francisco Sanchez Cardenas issued a bulletin
warning that ``the consequences could be catastrophic'' if Panama
City residents do not clean up stagnant water sites that abound in
this city of nearly 1 million.
   No cases of dengue or yellow fever have been reported in Panama
City. However, health officials last week found the mosquito that
transmits the diseases in two Panama City neighborhoods.
   Yellow fever impeded the first attempts to build the Panama
Canal in the last century. But the aedes aegypti mosquito that
spreads the contagious disease was eradicated from the country two
decades ago, Sanchez Cardenas said.
   People can be vaccinated against yellow fever, but not dengue
fever, the health minister said.

   A fire in a hotel room Saturday sent
smoke billowing through the building, forcing hundreds of hotel and
banquet guests outside, authorities said.
   Fire Chief Randall Sage said there were no injuries reported.
   ``There was heavy, black, plasticky, very toxic smoke on the
third floor,'' said Sage.
   He said the small fire that created the smoke did little damage
after starting in a third-floor room of the four-story Sheraton
Portsmouth where canned fuel was being used to heat food. No one
was in the room when the fire began.
   Sage said firefighters had trouble getting to the flames because
of the smoke.
   The hotel's guests were allowed to return within 1{ hours of the
fire. The hotel opened about six months ago.

   A grass fire swept through the Horicon
Marsh wildlife preserve Saturday, blocking travel on highways with
billowing clouds of smoke that could be seen for 25 miles.
   The Dodge County sheriff's office said winds that spread the
flames died down by 10 p.m., about seven hours after the fire
started. The fire burned 2,500 to 3,000 acres.
   The burn area was estimated about two miles wide, with flames
crawling north about the same distance. Wind spread flames through
tall weeds and underbrush common to the marsh.
   The marsh is an important stopping point for geese and other
migratory waterfowl. Parts of it are in the Horicon National
Wildlife Refuge while an adjoining southern portion is supervised
by the state Department of Natural Resources.

   South Korea and the Soviet Union,
which have no diplomatic relations, signed an agreement Saturday to
exchange trade offices.
   The accord, in the form of a memorandum, was signed by Vladimir
Golanov, vice president of the Soviet Union's Chamber of Economy
and Industry, and Lee Sun-kee, president of the state-run Korea
Trade Promotion Corp.
   South Korean officials said a formal agreement will be signed in
December when Lee visits Moscow.
   The trade offices, to be opened in Moscow and Seoul, will
encourage trade and invest in each other's country, the officials
said.
   One official, requesting anonymity, said the two sides came to
an understanding that in the absence of diplomatic relations, the
trade offices will be empowered to handle consular affairs.
   Since his arrival Tuesday, Golanov has held extensive talks with
South Korean government and business leaders to promote economic
cooperation between the two countries.
   Business officials quoted Golanov as saying that the Soviet
Union-South Korean interests include the development of Siberia and
joint ventures in automobiles, steelmaking, electronics and
construction.
   South Korea is pushing to promote trade and economic cooperation
with the Soviet Union and East European countries. It has recently
exchanged trade offices with Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   South Korea and China, which have no formal ties, are also
negotiating to set up trade offices in each other's capital,
according to industry sources.

<TEXT>
   The paternal grandparents of a baby born
and abandoned in an airplane restroom will be allowed to keep the
child in their New York home but the court will retain legal
custody of the infant, a court ruled Friday.
   A San Mateo County juvenile court judge said 3-month-old Alyssa
LoCasto will remain with her grandparents in the New York City
borough of Staten Island. The baby has been living with her
grandparents, John and Frances LoCasto, since August.
   The infant was found abandoned in the restroom of an airplane
after it landed at San Francisco International Airport on July 13.
   The child's mother, Christina LoCasto, 24, who turned herself in
the next day, gave birth secretly just before the flight left
Newark, N.J., and has pleaded innocent to a charge of felony child
endangerment.
   Christina LoCasto and her husband, Louis LoCasto, also of Staten
Island, had been having domestic problems when Alyssa was conceived
and the father did not know his wife had been pregnant or had given
birth just before the flight, authorities said.
   Each parent will be allowed to visit their daughter under the
supervision of a Department of Social Services official for six
hours per week. The visitation hours were increased from one hour a
week.
   The court also ordered the couple to continue in counseling and
required SanMateo and New York authorities to provide services with
the goal of reuniting the family.
   The parents may file to regain custody of the child, the court
said, but that is unlikely for at least a year, said an attorney
representing Louis LoCasto.
   No family members attended the hearing Friday and the custody
arrangement will be reviewed Jan. 20.
   The couple retained custody of their two older children, aged 6
and 21 months.
   Christina LoCasto's trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 31. If
convicted, she could face up to six years in prison. She is free on
$50,000 bail.

   A historic house that withstood a Union
cannonball was destroyed in a fire believed to have been set by
vagrants, officials said.
   The two-story frame house, one of nine pre-Civil War homes
remaining in this north Florida town, was built between 1857 and
1860 by Henry A. Gray, a steamboat captain and barge operator. It
was damaged by the cannonball during the Civil War in 1864.
   Capt. John Holley, Palatka's fire marshal, said electric and gas
service to the vacant house had been cut off when the fire began
Thursday.
   ``The Police Department had been running out some vagrants who
had been staying there,'' Holley said. ``They might have tried to
build a fire in the fireplace there.''

<HEAD>Judge Fines Four $100,000 Each in Libyan Case, Orders Three

   A federal judge fined three Libyans
$100,000 each Friday and ordered them to leave the country after
they pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the U.S. economic
embargo on Libya.
   A Moroccan, Manhal B. Mohamed, was fined $100,000 but still
sought to avoid deportation in the case which began in July with
the arrest of the four Arabs. The judge has yet rule on his
possible deportation.
   They initially were charged with conspiring to use Libyan funds
intended for students to finance anti-American political activities.
   The three Libyans were Mahdi M. Abousetta, Milad Shibani and
Ramadan T. Balgasem, all former officials of the Peoples Committee
for Libyan Students, based in McLean, Va.
   Libya established the organization to disburse money to Libyan
students in this country. But prosecutors charged that it also was
a front for the illegal diversion of funds, barred by trade
sanctions imposed by the Reagan administration.
   The pleas came before U.S. District Judge Albert V. Byran,
sitting in Alexandria, Va. He fined the four and ordered the
Libyans out of the country by Nov. 10.
   Three others were arrested at the same time as those who were
fined on Friday. One pleaded guilty last week. A second is set to
appear in court on Monday. And the third has fled the country,
prosecutors said.

<HEAD>New Legislation Boosts Food Giveaway Funds By $120 Million</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is going to buy an
additional $120 million worth of food for distribution to needy
people next year under recently enacted anti-hunger legislation.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode said Friday the food will be
purchased by USDA and sent to food banks and other outlets
beginning in January and continuing through September 1989.
   Bode said the quantities of food purchased will depend on
``market conditions'' at the time, but that plans now call for the
commodities to include peanut butter, canned pork, beans, egg mix
and raisins.
   The program is the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program,
or TEFAP, which began in December 1981 when President Reagan
authorized distribution of government-owned food to help reduce the
surplus stockpile of certain commodities, notably cheese, but also
including a variety of other products.
   As TEFAP developed, the surpluses dwindled so that the
department has had to trim the list of items for donation _ after
giving away more than 5 billion pounds of food worth more than $5
billion.
   That is when Congress stepped in with the recent Hunger
Prevention Act of 1988, which authorizes about $1.65 billion over
three years to bolster the government's emergency food programs,
including more funds for food stamps, school breakfasts, child-care
and summer food programs.
   The law also extended TEFAP for two years and provided money for
the additional purchases.
   Bode said that in addition to the $120 million of additional
purchases, the USDA's Commodity Credit Corp. still has $121.9
million worth of food available for TEFAP and is continuing to make
it available at current monthly rates of 6 million pounds of
butter, 4 million pounds of cornmeal and 12 million pounds of flour.
   Thus the total TEFAP funding is $241.9 million for the remainder
of the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, said Dianne Durant, a
spokeswoman for the department's Food and Nutrition Service.
   In addition, she said, Congress earmarked $40 million to help
feed homeless people at soup kitchens and shelters. Foods most
likely to be provided are canned pork, dry beans and canned fruit,
vegetables and juices.

<HEAD>House, Senate Bog Down Over How Much To Put In Tax Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The little tax bill that nobody loved is
hanging by a thread because House and Senate negotiators can't
agree on how big it should be.
   House negotiators are insisting on a bill that raises at least
$4.5 billion over three years, to pay for $4.5 billion of selected
tax cuts. Senators, backed by the Reagan administration, are
refusing to budge above $3 billion.
   The dispute torpedoed closed-door discussions on the bill Friday
and House aides were saying the measure probably is dead. Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., who is heading the Senate delegation, was not so
pessimistic.
   ``We have not selected the pallbearers yet,'' he said, adding
that Senate aides would look over the latest House proposal over
the weekend. ``Then we'll see what the mood is next week,'' the
final week of the 100th Congress, Baucus said.
   Tax bills usually are highly popular items with members of
Congress, simply because lawmakers have found there is little that
makes voters happier than a tax cut.
   But because of a monumental budget deficit, there is no surplus
money in the treasury to finance a lot of tax cuts. So every dollar
of tax cut for Peter must be offset by a dollar tax increase on
Paul.
   That is why this year's bills are so relatively small _ about
$7.5 billion as originally passed by the House and just under $3
billion in the Senate version.
   The bills, two years in the making, have not been a top-priority
item for either the House, the Senate or the Reagan administration.
The only big push for passage has come from accountants, eager to
have some errors and ambiguities in the 1986 tax law cleared up,
and from farmers demanding relief from the tax on diesel fuel.
   Either bill would respond to those concerns. Both bills also
extend several expiring tax benefits, provide targeted relief to
lower-income homebuyers, workers attending night school, farmers
and others, and raise other taxes to pay for the benefits. The
Senate package also includes a ``bill of rights'' to help taxpayers
involved in disputes with the Internal Revenue Service.
   The exchange of offers before negotiations were broken off
indicated some form of the bill of rights will be in the final bill
_ if there is one. In addition, it would repeal the requirement
that farmers pay the diesel tax on off-road fuel and then apply for
a refund, and also prevent mutual fund owners from paying tax on
``phantom income'' from those funds.
   The negotiations are complicated by the fact that Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is also
his party's candidate for vice president. Ever since he was
nominated in July, there have been indications he did not want to
be identified closely with a bill that opponents could point to as
new evidence of a Democratic tendency to raise taxes to finance
more spending.
   ``Senator Bentsen's position all year long has been that he is
not interested in raising a lot of taxes to be plowed back into
other tax cuts,'' said Bill Maddox, a Finance Committee spokesman.
   On the other hand, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., head of the
House delegation, points out that his bill passed the House by a
380-25 vote _ the widest margin for a tax bill in 20 years. His
aides say it is difficult for Rostenkowski to drop provisions that
got such broad support.
   The Senate bill passed by an even more lopsided margin, 87-1.
   In backing away from their $7 billion-plus package, House
negotiators agreed to drop a money-raiser, opposed by the Reagan
administration, that would require corporations to pay more tax on
dividends from stocks they own in other companies.
   The House also agreed to modify slightly its call for repeal of
the ``completed-contract accounting'' method used by defense
contractors and many large builders. This method allows
postponement on some building profits.
   Under the proposed compromise, the benefit would be retained
only for construction of housing.

   A former government financial officer who
admitted embezzling $1.37 million received a stern lecture and a
five-year prison sentence from a judge who ordered him immediately
put behind bars.
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ignored an
impassioned plea Friday by a defense lawyer to give William J.
Burns 10 more days with his wife and twin sons _ towheaded toddlers
who could be heard screaming outside the courtroom.
   ``I know they love Mr. Burns very much and they would very much
like him to be with them, but my responsibility is just quite
different,'' Johnson told defense attorney David R. Addis.
   Burns' wife, Kathy, a daughter from a previous marriage, and
other relatives sobbed loudly as he was led off to prison by U.S.
marshals.
   Burns pleaded guilty Aug. 11 to charges he emezzled $1.2 million
since 1982 from the Agency for International Development, where he
had worked for 21 years until his arrest last May.
   He agreed to surrender his $300,000 house and virtually all his
possessions as part of a plea agreement with Justice Department
prosecutors.
   Burns later admitted that the scheme actually began in 1980 and
included thefts that brought the total to $1.37 million,
prosecutors said.
   ``I find it significant that you persisted for over five years
in perpetrating this criminal activity against the taxpayers of the
United States,'' Johnson told Burns, explaining why she thought he
deserved a harsher sentence than recommended under the sentencing
guidelines.
   Under the guidelines, Burns would have received a sentence
ranging from 31 to 37 months. Burns must serve the full five years
of his prison sentence under a 1984 law that abolished parole for
such convictions.
   Burns was also ordered to perform 300 hours of community service
during the three years following his release from prison.
   ``You may have felt it was some faceless government, but you
were stealing from the taxpayers of the United States,'' the judge
said. ``The United States from which you stole is actually the
people who are here in the courtroom supporting you.''
   ``You violated every bit of trust that anyone had ever put in
you,'' the judge said, noting that ``in your devious manner stole
at a rate that made it difficult for it to be ascertained.''
   ``If there had not been an investigation there is no reason for
me to believe it would have stopped in May, 1988,'' the judge said.
   The scheme began to unravel late last year when AID
investigators doing a routine security check on Burns discovered he
lived in an expensive home even though his annual salary was just
over $35,000.
   Burns admitted submitting phony travel reimbursement forms to a
fictitious person in whose name he opened a bank account. He
pleaded guilty to theft, filing false claims and tax evasion.
   Prosecutor James Cole said the theft ``if not the largest, is
certainly one of the largest single thefts of public funds'' in
U.S. history. The money ``was not stolen out of a need, it was
stolen out of pure greed.''
   Cole said Burns used the money to ``buy any luxury he wanted to
lavish on himself and his family.''
   His conduct exhibited ``the attitude of `I can spend whatever I
want because I have unlimited funds in the Treasury of the United
States because of my position of trust.'''
   Among the items Burns bought were a sports car and commercial
videogames, which cost $2,500 apiece, Cole said.
   Afterwards, Addis said Burns would file an appeal of the
sentencing, which is allowed when a judge departs from the
guidelines.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Hope For Swift Trial Of New Fraud Charges Against
LaRouche</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr. is facing new criminal charges he defrauded lenders of $34
million and federal prosecutors vow this case will be resolved more
quickly than their first one against him.
   LaRouche, who is running for president as an independent, and
six of his associates were charged with conspiracy and fraud here
Friday by a federal grand jury which said they borrowed the money
from individuals around the country over four years with no
intention of repaying it.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said the 13-count indictment was the
culmination of a two-year investigation which began in October 1986
with an FBI and Internal Revenue Service raid on LaRouche
headquarters in Leesburg, Va. A truck load of documents, tape
recordings and records was seized on that occasion.
   LaRouche was named in all 13 counts. He was charged with
conspiracy to commit mail fraud, 11 counts of mail fraud and
conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
   Hudson called the case a ``lean, 13-count indictment'' and
predicted it would be tried in a few weeks of testimony and
completed before LaRouche is scheduled to be retried in Boston in
early January on other federal conspiracy charges.
   There were indications that federal officials had set out to
avoid or overcome what Hudson agreed was a ``blizzard of defense
motions'' which helped land the Boston case in a mistrial last May
after six months in court. The mistrial came when four jurors
complained about the length and conduct of the case.
   Two federal sources, who declined to be identified, said early
drafts of the Virginia indictment contained racketeering charges
which top-level Justice Department officials dropped from the case
before the grand jury was asked to vote. There have been lengthy
court challenges from defendants when the Justice Department uses
racketeering charges in cases that do not involve traditional
organized crime.
   Noting the federal judges in his district ``have a reputation
for moving cases quickly,'' Hudson predicted, ``Our judges will
rule with dispatch'' on any defense motions.
   LaRouche's attorneys unsuccessfully sought Friday to delay the
Virginia indictment until after the Nov. 8 election, saying it
would interfere with LaRouche's campaigning in 12 states and the
District of Columbia.
   But the request for a temporary restraining order was rejected
by Judge Stanley Sporkin in Washington.
   The grand jury said that LaRouche had not filed a federal income
tax return since at least 1979 and conspired to conceal an
undetermined amount spent on his behalf by having his living
expenses paid out of bank accounts in the names of corporations
associated with his major organization, the National Caucus of
Labor Committees.
   The grand jury charged that during the 1984 presidential
campaign, committees supporting LaRouche for president borrowed
$4.3 million.
   The grand jurors said that between late 1983 and early 1987,
commercial entities controlled by LaRouche borrowed more than $30
million.
   The indictment said loans, from $165 to $200,000, were raised by
telephone solicitors who promised specific interest payments and
specific repayment dates, assured the lenders the loans were good
investments and that the organization had a good history of
repayment, all the while knowing that LaRouche's groups had no
intention of repaying the money.
   The other defendants were William Wertz, described as LaRouche's
fund-raising chief; Edward Spannaus, described as LaRouche's legal
chief; and four individual fund-raisers, Michael Billington, Dennis
Small, Paul Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.
   They were all charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and
various counts of mail fraud.
   LaRouche faces a potential maximum penalty of 65 years in prison
and a fine of $3.25 million on the indictment returned Friday. The
others would face various lesser penalties.
   Hudson said he expected LaRouche and the other six defendants to
appear voluntarily for arraignment in federal court on Monday
afternoon.
   At a news conference outside the U.S. attorney's office, Dana
Scanlon, a LaRouche spokesman, called the indictment ``political
dirty tricks'' inspired by former Justice Department criminal
division chief William Weld, who she said had become a legal
associate of Paul Brountas, campaign manager for Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   She said she could not explain how the Dukakis campaign could
engineer an indictment during the Reagan administration.
   Hudson rejected the allegation. ``Lyndon LaRouche is being
treated just as any other citizen would be who is charged with
committing a crime,'' he said.
   The indictment said that LaRouche personally controlled the
entire operation and told supporters the population at large
consisted of ``freeloaders'' who ``owed'' the organization money
for saving them from various ``holocausts,'' and that people who
did not give money to his organization were ``not morally fit to
survive.''

<HEAD>Report Card: Child Support Enforcement Programs Need Improving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Better enforcement is needed within programs
that compel absent parents to pay child support, Rep. Thomas
Downey, D-N.Y., said in releasing a ``report card'' that found
fault with both federal and state agencies.
   The Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement received a grade
of C on the report released Friday, while the states and
territories ran a gamut from A to F for programs to ensure that
non-custodial parents support their children.
   ``Parenting in this society has been a free ride, a joyride,''
Downey said in calling for tighter enforcement.
   ``What we're dealing with here is much more important than just
dollars,'' said Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., who joined Downey at the
news conference. ``Taking responsibility for your children is very
important ot these children.''
   In the United States, there are currently nearly 9 million
mothers with children whose fathers do not live with them, Downey
said. Only about 2 million of these families received their full
child support payments in 1985. Another 1 million families received
partial payments, and almost 6 million received nothing.
   ``We can and should do better,'' Downey said.
   A mandatory wage withholding provision that is included in the
welfare law signed by President Reagan on Thursday will help
resolve the problem, said Downey, who is acting chairman of the
Ways and Means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment
compensation.
   The report card, written by the staff of the House Ways and
Means Committee, graded the Federal Office of Child Support
Enforcement based on questionnaires sent to the 54 state and
territorial child support enforcement programs. It also graded each
of the state and territorial programs based on questionnaire
responses and other data.
   Wayne Stanton, administrator of the Family Support
Administration, which oversees OCSE, said he was not displeased
with the office's showing on the report card.
   ``I think in the ultimate end, this report will tend to improve
child support around the nation, and that's what I care about,''
Stanton said.
   The OCSE, a part of the Health and Human Services Department,
was rated in nine areas, including how it establishes standards for
state child support enforcement programs; sets minimum
organizational and staffing equirements for the states; reviews and
approves state plans; conducts audits and evaluations of state
plans; and operates the federal Parent Locator Service.
   OCSE got some of its highest marks _ Bs _ for the locator
service and certifying cases in which states apply to have past-due
child support money taken out of an absent parent's income tax
refund.
   The states' grades ranged from excellent to failing, but as
Downey noted, they were marked on a curve.
   ``The state of Michigan is the valedictorian of the class,'' he
said. ``Three other states _ Delaware, New Jersey and North Dakota
_ also earned an A.''
   Seven jurisdictions flunked: Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma,
Texas, West Virginia, the District of Columbia and Guam. However,
Guam failed for lack of data, the report said.
   States were graded on how they establish paternity; collect
child support; operate cost-effectively; collect interstate
payments; and reduce welfare costs.
   The average paternity establishment rate was 31 percent,
according to the report. Three states exceeded 75 percent:
Missouri, Vermont and North Dakota. States under 10 percent were
Arizona, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, West
Virginia and Wyoming. No data were available for three territories.
   The national average collection rate was 30 percent in cases of
families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and 39
percent in non-AFDC cases.
   The average collection cost nationwide for AFDC cases was $1.49
per dollar of administrative expense, and $2.61 in non-AFDC cases.
   States recovered about 12 percent and avoided an estimated 5
percent of AFDC costs by collecting child support.

<HEAD>Ruling To Give AT&T Competitors More Pay Phone Long Distance
Business</HEAD>

   Telephone callers using Bell credit cards will
have a wider range of services available to them under a federal
judge's order requiring the regional Bell companies to stop
discriminating in favor of AT&T on long-distance calls.
   The ruling gives the Bell companies 75 days to begin routing
long-distance calls that are not dialed directly to the
long-distance carrier to which the caller has presubscribed, such
as MCI or Sprint.
   Calls placed with a Bell calling card, or which use a Bell
operator, now go over AT&T lines automatically unless the caller
has a credit card with another company and uses an access code to
bypass the local Bell operator and reach that long-distance carrier.
   Thus the ruling applies primarily to non-AT&T long-distance
customers who, for whatever reason, do not carry a non-AT&T credit
card. It also will allow holders of such cards to charge local
calls, which now can be done only with a Bell card.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene ordered the Bell companies
``to cease discriminating in favor of AT&T'' with respect to their
calling cards and pay phones by Jan. 1, 1989 _ the fifth
anniversary of the court order that stripped AT&T of its local
operating companies.
   ``Five years is long enough'' for the Baby Bells, as they are
called, to provide equal access to their local networks for all
long-distance companies, ``and the court expects the parties to
meet its deadline,'' Greene said.
   Callers using credit cards issued by MCI Communications Corp.,
US Sprint Communications Co. and other AT&T competitors are not
afforded the same services as AT&T and Bell card holders. For
example, they are unable to charge local calls to their card or to
charge long-distance calls made through a Bell operator.
   Before divestiture, when American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
the local companies were part of the giant Bell System, they used
the same database to validate and bill credit-card calls.
   After divestiture, because of the use of the common database,
AT&T and the Bell companies issued the same calling card number for
any particular customer.
   Consequently, all long-distance calls made with Bell cards were
directed to AT&T. Also, calls from Bell-owned pay phones also were
routed to AT&T.
   MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company after
AT&T, complained about the arrangement to the Justice Department,
which asked Greene to stop the Bells from discriminating in favor
of AT&T.
   In his decision, Greene ordered the Bells by Jan. 1 to make
available to all long-distance carriers the same validation data
for its calling cards that the company provides to AT&T ``on the
same prices, terms and conditions as are extended to AT&T.'' This
means Bell card-holders will be able to charge long-distance calls
to their carrier of choice.
   He also ruled that the owners of premises where Bell pay phones
are located will be able to choose by Jan. 1 which long-distance
company the calls from that phone will be routed to.
   Nearly half of all calls from Bell pay phones are
operator-assisted, yielding more than $1 billion in revenues a year
_ most of it to AT&T, Greene said.
   In addition, Greene said the Baby Bells must inform its
calling-card customers that long-distance calls charged to the card
will be provided by a long-distance company _ not the Bell company
_ but not always the carrier to which they presubscribed as a
``dial-1'' service on their home phone.
   The judge also said the regional companies could keep in
circulation _ but only for AT&T customers _ Bell credit cards that
carry the same international number as used by AT&T, provided they
issue cards to other customers listing the international number of
the long-distance company to which they presubscribed.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
ending a triumphant annual conference of her Conservative Party,
has accused advocates of a more politically entwined Europe of
secretly trying to spread socialism.
   Mrs. Thatcher made her bluntest rejection yet of what she
regards as unrealistic talk about a so-called United States of
Europe.
   And, sensitive to charges that Britons who have become wealthier
through nearly a decade of her right-wing government have also
become greedier, Mrs. Thatcher urged generosity as a cornerstone of
her program for the 1990s.
   ``Those who care, and they are the great majority of us, now
have the means to give,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a keynote address
Friday to party delegates.
   Opposition leader Neil Kinnock, who at his Labor Party's
convention last week described the Thatcher theme as ``No number
other than one, no person other than me,'' commented, ``It
obviously struck a raw nerve.''
   As Mrs. Thatcher ended her speech, the 4,500 delegates broke
into applause and chanted, ``10 more years.'' The 63-year-old prime
minister stood with her arms raised in acknowledgement, before
leaving the hall to strains of the song ``Land of Hope and Glory.''
   Already the longest-serving leader in the Western world, and 16
months into her third five-year term, Mrs. Thatcher signaled plans
to run for an unprecedented fourth term, or longer.
   ``We are all too young to put our feet up ... I include
myself,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``The Conservative Party occupies the common ground of British
politics ... And so it has fallen to us to lead Britain into the
1990s. And, who knows, beyond.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks on the Common Market followed a
controversial speech last month in which she rejected moves for
closer political or monetary union after 1992, when all trade
barriers among the member nations are due to be dismantled.
   ``Of course, that wasn't at all convenient for those who want to
bring about a federal Europe by stealth,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``We haven't worked all these years to free Britain from the
paralysis of socialism only to see it creep through the back door
of central control and bureaucracy from Brussels,'' she said,
referring to the EEC headquarters.
   Mrs. Thatcher argued that Britain has taken a lead in tackling
practical issues in Europe such as the 1992 single market and
agricultural subsidy reforms. ``With those sort of credentials, no
one should doubt Britain's whole-hearted commitment to Europe.''
   On social issues, she urged Britons to give more to charity and
assist in crime prevention and promised new efforts to preserve the
environment.
   ``Freedom entails responsibilities, first to the family, then to
the neighbors, then to the nation _ and beyond,'' she said.
   The Conservatives finished the conference, the last in Britain's
autumn season of political conventions, with polls showing Mrs.
Thatcher maintaining a comfortable 5-point lead over Labor, which
is struggling to devise a new, more moderate platform.

<HEAD>Senate, House To Seek Compromise Drug Bill Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House and Senate, each having completed
its own sweeping drug bill, hope they can agree on a compromise
measure quickly next week and leave town to spend the final weeks
of the campaign season at home.
   The Senate passed a $2.6 billion version of the legislation
Friday on an 87-3 vote. With the House having approved a stricter,
$2.1 billion bill last month, the next step is for lawmakers to
agree on a final product they can send President Reagan for his
signature.
   Both bills fire shots in all directions in an effort to reduce
drug usage in the United States. They would increase spending on
law enforcement and treatment programs, create a death penalty for
many drug offenders who commit murders, stiffen sentences for a
range of drug offenses, and spur federal efforts to obtain better
cooperation from countries where drugs are produced.
   ``No matter how dedicated local law enforcement is, they do not
have the manpower nor the resources to fight organized drug
trafficking,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   ``This is the first live shot in the war against drugs,'' said
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader.
   Many liberals disagreed. Although most of them voted for final
passage, many of them opposed parts of the bill, saying they were
too harsh and arguing that the measure appears tough but will do
little to solve the country's narcotics woes.
   ``Just to grow hair on your chest here on the Senate floor so
you can send out press releases back home and tell everybody how
tough you are on drugs is no solution,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark. ``It is a multi-faceted problem, and the solutions are
multi-faceted.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union called the measure ``a
serious threat to civil liberties,'' singling out language
providing for the death penalty, imposing drug testing on many
transportation industry workers, and allowing lawmakers to next
year limit prisoners' rights to appeal their sentences.
   White House officials distributed a statement to senators Friday
saying Reagan ``strongly supports enactment of a sound, prudent,
and effective anti-drug bill substantially like the House-passed
version without further delay.''
   Lawmakers also must decide how to pay for the programs the
legislation creates. Lawmakers and aides say Congress might
consider a separate bill next week or in 1989 that would actually
provide the money _ and add to the deficit.
   The 600-page bill contained language requiring warning labels on
alcoholic beverage containers, strengthening child pornography
laws, inducing police to seize the drivers' licenses of drunken
drivers on the spot, and banning the sale or possession of plastic
guns that cannot be detected by screening devices.
   Courts could decree the death penalty for people engaged in
illegal drug activities who kill civilians or law officers.
Liberals tried but failed to substitute mandatory life imprisonment.
   The bill would distribute $676 million to federal agencies to
hire 3,287 additional law officers, to purchase helicopters and
other equipment and to build new prisons. Another $275 million
would be dispersed among state and local authorities.
   The government would provide $1 billion for treatment programs,
including for the training of teachers and health professionals,
the construction of rehabilitation facilities and the initiation of
corporate anti-drug programs for their employees.
   People convicted of possessing even small amounts of illegal
drugs could be fined up to $10,000 and could face the loss of many
types of federal benefits, including food stamps and farm payments.
   The votes against the bill were cast by Sens. William Proxmire,
D-Wis., Dan Evans, R-Wash., and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore.
   Not voting were Sens. David Boren, D-Okla.; Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.; David Durenberger, R-Minn.; John Heinz, R-Pa.; Bennett
Johnston, D-La.; Dan Quayle, R-Ind.; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; Terry
Sanford, D-N.C.; Robert Stafford, R-Vt.; and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.

   Lawmakers are accusing the Department of
Energy of deliberately letting the operators of a government-owned
a uranium processing plant send radioactive pollution into the air
and water of southwestern Ohio.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., said it appeared the agency had given
itself ``almost a papal ability to absolve sins.''
   ``The company ... admits it polluted but its defense is that it
had permission to pollute and DOE gave it that permission,'' he
said Friday at a hearing.
   The Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati has
processed uranium for use in nuclear weapons since 1951 and
discharged radioactive waste into the air, a major aquifer and the
nearby Great Miami River.
   ``For most of the last 35 years DOE sat on its hands and did
nothing to fix the situation at that plant,'' said Rep. Thomas
Luken, D-Ohio.
   The Energy Department said in a recent court filing that at
first there was no technology to stop the discharges and in recent
years the money to do so has not been available.
   Eric Fygi, the agency's acting general counsel, told the
lawmakers the court documents do not provide a complete picture of
the situation.
   Luken, who arranged the hearing by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee panel, said the agency ``admits that it knew for over 20
years that its waste pits were leaking.''
   ``It now admits that it knew that the plant's air pollution
control system was obsolete and deteriorated before it was
refurbished,'' he said. ``And it now admits that it knew that heavy
rains swept uranium-contaminated water into a nearby stream and
thence into the groundwater.''
   Government nuclear plants were under jurisdiction of the old
Atomic Energy Commission and its successor Nuclear Regulatory
Comission before those functions were placed under the Department
of Energy when it was formed during the Carter administration.
   Ohio's environmental protection chief, Richard Shank, told the
transportation, tourism and hazardous materials subcommittee the
plant has discharged 298,000 pounds of uranium into the air and
167,000 pounds of uranium into the Great Miami River since 1951.
   An independent analyst said he suspected actual levels were much
higher.
   ``There is a lot of evidence that the operator was quite
negligent,'' said Arjun Makhijani, director of energy programs at
the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Takoma Park,
Md. ``Many, many elementary precautions were not taken.''
   Makhijani expressed doubts about records showing no discharges
in the 1970s when the plant was badly deteriorating and the federal
government spending nothing on improvements.
   He also questioned the records' accuracy because the plant staff
was unfamiliar with crucial monitoring equipment. He said some
measuring instruments were in poor condition.
   ``Most of the radioactive materials which were discharged,
particularly those discharged to the air, were not monitored,''
Makhijani said.
   Charles Zinser of Cincinnati told the panel he suspects the
plant's discharges were responsible for the rare cancers that
afflicted his 8-year-old and 2-year-old sons.
   And Joe Carvitti, whose father, Joseph Carvitti died of liver
cancer after working at the plant from 1952 to 1974, told the
subcommittee the death was ruled work-related by the Ohio Workers'
Compensation Bureau _ a ruling now being appealed a second time by
NLO Inc., which operated the plant from the early 1950's until 1986.
   The company is being sued for $300 million by 14,000 people who
live or work near the plant. The Energy Department is trying to
shield the contractor from liability on grounds the company was
following government orders.
   Documents filed by the department Sept. 30 in U.S. District
Court in Cincinnati said all actions by the contractor were
required or approved by the government.
   A former assistant manager of the plant, Weldon Adams, told the
subcommittee problems stemmed from lack of money.
   But Luken and Cooper rejected that argument.
   ``I have known of no instance when Congress has refused money
when a health and safety problem is at stake,'' Cooper said.
   Luken called the plant ``a witch's brew of chemical wastes'' and
said the court documents amount to ``a statement that DOE was
waging a kind of chemical warfare against the community of
Fernald.''
   The Fernald foundry, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, is the
only plant of its kind in the United States. It turns uranium into
ingots needed to make nuclear weapons. It's also a storage site for
radioactive and hazardous materials.

Mieczyslaw Rakowski, time to form a new government.
   Mrs. Thatcher will hold talks in Warsaw with Rakowski and Polish

<HEAD>US-Soviet Cultural Bridge Produces First Joint Rock Video</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not as far-reaching as arms control, but
proof that glasnost is on a roll can be seen almost daily in a
Chicago studio where U.S. and Soviet filmmakers are producing a
rock video.
   The project, the brainchild of recent philosophy graduate Robert
Kath, brings together seven students from Northwestern University
and Moscow's Victor Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.
   The Americans spent three weeks in the Soviet Union last month,
and the Soviets are nearing the end of a similar stint here.
   Both sides are represented by full crews _ producers, directors
and cinematographers _ that have thrashed out their creative
differences for the video and an accompanying 30-minute documentary
in the finest spirit of compromise.
   ``The most surprising thing,'' Kath said, ``is how their eyes
seem to land on the same things as ours _ the jazz musicians
playing in the subway, the wealthy bankers walking down LaSalle
Street.
   ``Once we had agreed on a concept for the video, everything else
was pretty much downhill,'' he added. ``The language of film, we
discovered, was a very common thing.''
   The story line for the five-minute production is a variation on
boy-meets-girl: A young American girls dreams of dancing with the
Bolshoi Ballet, but doesn't make it, even as a young Soviet boy's
dream of coming to America is shattered.
   ``We hoped to show how we are different,'' said Soviet director
Boris Ayrapetjan, ``and yet the same, how our cultures want to be
closer, but how accomplishing that is not as easy as it should be.
   ``We could not show only sweetness and light ... but even so, we
choose to end the video with the two heroes as children again. That
way there is still hope they will achieve their goals.
   ``We must leave some hope. Otherwise,'' he continued, ``this
effort will have been senseless.''
   The music is the song ``Bridges of Trust,'' a collaborative
effort by Soviet composer Vladimir Kopisov and the American group
Collective Vision written for a peace march from Leningrad to
Moscow last year.
   Valentina, a backup singer for Prince's ``Purple Rain'' tour,
sang the lead track. Like almost everyone else associated with the
project, she donated her services.
   Each group was responsible for the costs in its country and the
bill for both the video and documentary is about $250,000.
   The video will debut at Chicago's Limelight Club next Thursday.
Depending on whether or not Kath can find a sponsor for ``Bridge,''
it could wind up being distributed to outlets ranging from MTV to
film trailers in second-run movie houses nationwide.
   The Soviets already have committed to showing the video on
national television, but Tatiana Storchak, vice president of the
Moscow film institute, said its air time will be proportional to
how successful a product it is judged to be.
   ``It is a small piece of film; we are used to working with much
longer,'' he said. ``But we have learned from our collaborators how
many images can be compacted into a short space, how we can work at
a conscious level and reach even deeper.''

   Northern Californians love to hate Southern Californians, and
Southern Californians love not to care.
   So this year's Golden State World Series between the Los Angeles
Dodgers and the Oakland A's rekindles a rivalry that has already
split families and fueled stereotypes of oh-so-laid-back
southerners and fogged-in northerners.
   SoCal has the sun, sand, surf punks and a serious attitude
problem. NorCal has the giant redwoods, mighty rivers and a lot of
folks who haven't heard the '60s are over.
   Chronically cerebral Northern Californians get defensive about
being lumped together with airheads and sun-worshipping movie
stars. Tired of being misunderstood by the rest of the nation, they
suffer from a severe superiority complex. How else can you
rationalize living in fog when there's year-round sun and fun to be
had just 500 miles south?
   Angelenos, on the other hand, are known not only for getting all
the attention but for having too much fun to notice.
   ``They hate us because we took their water,'' said L.A. office
worker Ray Wiles, referring to the arid South's triumph over the
North in the early part of the century, when it won the right to
import water from the North, water that transformed desert into
paradise.
   ``Why should we hate them? We have everything,'' Wiles said.
``We've got the weather. We've got the beaches. We've got the
Dodgers.''
   ``They laugh at us as the blond, surfer airheads,'' adds Steve
Stoller, a 24-year-old job-hunting Angeleno. ``We look at them as
liberals from the '60s.''
   The feelings of animosity are shared. On Thursday, several
hundred Oakland fans, some dressed head-to-toe in A's green and
gold, gathered to send their team south with a party.
   ``Us folks up north don't like L.A.,'' said Philip Franklin of
Oakland, as he led the crowd in chants. ``They don't like us. They
not only want our water ... they want all the baseball glory and we
can't just let them have any of it.''
   Of course, water isn't the only issue. More than a few Oakland
residents still hold a grudge against Los Angeles for stealing
their beloved Oakland Raiders _ now known locally as the Oakland
Traitors _ in a 1982 National Football League realignment.
   A's fan Deborah Hurtado summed it up neatly: ``We're the best
part of California, and we're going to prove it.''
   Although blue-collar Oakland lives in the shadow of San
Francisco, the spiritual and cultural hub across the Bay, the
``other'' city is a fitting home for a World Series team that
dominates the diamond through sheer arm-bashing brawn. Fans from
all over Northern California root for the mighty A's.
   San Francisco Giants fanatics are crossing the league line in
droves to root against their National League rivals, the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
   The Giants Dugout, a San Francisco boutique dedicated to
baseball memorabilia, is stocked full of A's souvenirs, but not a
single Dodgers logo.
   Famed San Francisco trial attorney lawyer Melvin Belli said he's
been an A's fan ``since the Dodgers got so bad.''
   ``We're all looking for the A's up here,'' Belli said. ``They're
just too good. They've got great stars and I think they're really
going to put 'em away.''
   San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has teamed up with Oakland Mayor
Lionel Wilson to pull for the A's.
   And in a grudging gesture of Northern generosity, many A's fans
are predicting that the Athletics will win the Series in five games.
   ``We'll give 'em a chance to win one,'' said Elizabeth Miller of
Berkeley. ``It would dampen their spirits too much if (the A's) did
them like they did the Red Sox.''
   The A's trounced Boston in four games to sweep the American
League's Championship Series, while the Dodgers needed seven games
to dispatch the New York Mets.

   British Airways is giving economy-class passengers
a glimpse into the future by installing tiny televisions on one of
its jets, an in-flight entertainment experiment that the airline
says could catch on.
   The airline introduced the miniature sets on Friday on a Boeing
747 that flies from London to New York. If the four-month trial is
successful, the small sets will be installed on other flights, said
airline chief executive Colin Marshall.
   Each coach passenger will be able to view a three-inch screen
attached to the back of the seat in front of him or her, Marshall
said. The six channels will display pre-recorded feature films, TV
shows, and sports, news, music and children's programs.

   Mayor Henry Cisneros said he will try
to serve out the remaining months of his fourth term with dignity
after acknowledging a close, personal relationship with a woman
outside his marriage.
   Cisneros, 41, a popular Hispanic leader once considered a
potential Democratic vice presidential candidate, talked to
reporters Friday after a newspaper article detailed his
relationship with Linda Medlar, 39.
   Mrs. Medlar, who has helped the mayor in various fund-raising
campaigns, was quoted in a front-page column in Friday's San
Antonio Express-News as calling the mayor ``love of my life'' and
saying they ``hope to be able to live out the rest of our lives
together.''
   Mrs. Medlar is married to the co-owner of a jewelry store.
   Cisneros said Friday he wants to work out his marital problems
to protect his wife of 19 years, Mary Alice, and his teen-age
daughters and young son. He declined to elaborate on his
relationship with Mrs. Medlar, but said it was not the major
problem between him and his wife.
   ``I am saying that I am a human being in addition to being
mayor,'' Cisneros said. ``That I am not perfect and that I have
various kinds of needs of friendship and support.''
   Cisneros has announced he won't seek re-election when his term
expires in May or run for state office in 1990.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who was sharply criticized
by Irish-Americans after a trip to Ireland in July, got a warm
welcome from an Irish group that marched from Boston to New York on
behalf of the handicapped.
   The marchers presented Koch on Friday with a green, white and
gold rosette and ribbon, the colors of the Irish Republic.
   Frank Flannery, chief executive of the Irish Rehabilitation
Institute, said the rosette was made in one of its centers in
Ireland. He said Koch could wear it ``possibly on St. Patrick's
Day'' next year.
   ``Do you think I'll get into the parade?'' Koch quipped,
referring to next year's St. Patrick's Day parade in New York.
   ``I hope you do,'' said Flannery.
   After his trip, Koch said that British troops in Northern
Ireland were playing a ``positive role'' in preventing bloodshed
between Catholics and Protestants.
   Peter King, the Nassau County comptroller who sympathizes with
efforts to end British rule in Northern Ireland, had urged that
Koch be barred from the parade because of those comments. Koch
later apologized and said the British troops were an occupying army
that should leave within five years.

``Not for one minute did I think I was doing this alone.''
   Ritter won the women's high jump in Seoul, South Korea. Her
victory ended eight years of frustration that included the U.S.
boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow and a disappointing
eighth-place finish at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles.
   ``Louise, you've made us all feel like winners,'' said Leon
Long, mayor of this town of 2,400 people 20 miles south of Dallas.
He gave Ritter a key to the city and presented a proclamation
renaming a stretch of road that runs by the high school in her

   Political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr. is facing new criminal charges he defrauded lenders of $34
million and federal prosecutors vow this case will be resolved more
quickly than their first one against him.
   LaRouche, who is running for president as an independent, and
six of his associates were charged with conspiracy and fraud here
Friday by a federal grand jury which said they borrowed the money
from individuals around the country over four years with no
intention of repaying it.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said the 13-count indictment was the
culmination of a two-year investigation which began in October 1986
with an FBI and Internal Revenue Service raid on LaRouche
headquarters in Leesburg, Va. A truck load of documents, tape
recordings and records was seized on that occasion.
   LaRouche was named in all 13 counts. He was charged with
conspiracy to commit mail fraud, 11 counts of mail fraud and

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
ending a triumphant annual conference of her Conservative Party,
has accused advocates of a more politically entwined Europe of
secretly trying to spread socialism.
   Mrs. Thatcher made her bluntest rejection yet of what she

   And, sensitive to charges that Britons who have become wealthier
through nearly a decade of her right-wing government have also
become greedier, Mrs. Thatcher urged generosity as a cornerstone of
her program for the 1990s.
   ``Those who care, and they are the great majority of us, now
have the means to give,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a keynote address
Friday to party delegates.

   The House and Senate, each having completed
its own sweeping drug bill, hope they can agree on a compromise
measure quickly next week and leave town to spend the final weeks
of the campaign season at home.
   The Senate passed a $2.6 billion version of the legislation
Friday on an 87-3 vote. With the House having approved a stricter,
$2.1 billion bill last month, the next step is for lawmakers to
agree on a final product they can send President Reagan for his
signature.
   Both bills fire shots in all directions in an effort to reduce
drug usage in the United States. They would increase spending on
law enforcement and treatment programs, create a death penalty for
many drug offenders who commit murders, stiffen sentences for a
range of drug offenses, and spur federal efforts to obtain better
cooperation from countries where drugs are produced.
   ``No matter how dedicated local law enforcement is, they do not
have the manpower nor the resources to fight organized drug
trafficking,'' said Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.

   One of two Tuscarora Indians acquitted of
charges stemming from their armed takeover of a newspaper called
the verdict ``historic,'' but the prosecutor said he feels sorry
for the hostages they took.
   Eddie Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, were found innocent
Friday of all charges related to the February takeover in which
they held hostages for 10 hours at the office of The Robesonian.
   The jury agreed with defense lawyers' contention that the two
men had no criminal intent when they took over the building to draw
attention to alleged official corruption, racism and drug
trafficking in Robeson County in southeastern North Carolina. The
county is one-third Indian, one-third black and one-third white.
   Hatcher and Jacobs faced charges of making and possessing
illegal firearms, conspiring to make those weapons and conveying
false information about explosives. A federal charge of
hostage-taking was dismissed earlier this week against Jacobs, but
remained against Hatcher.

   Hundreds of Northwest Airlines passengers
have been stricken with an illness that may be linked to
contaminated food served on several flights, a malady so
distressing that some victims said they ``thought they were going
to die.''
   ``We have cases all over the country,'' said Michael Osterholm,
the state epidemiologist. The Minnesota Health Department received
hundreds of calls Thursday and Friday, he said.
   Five of the reports, which came to light after members of the
Minnesota Vikings football team were sickened, were confirmed as
cases of the bacterial illness shigellosis, an intestinal infection
that causes severe diarrhea, gripping abdominal pain and other
symptoms that can last for five to seven days.
   ``The one common phrase being reported (to investigators) is
people thinking they have never been so sick, that they thought
they were going to die,'' Osterholm said.

   Morocco and the independence movement in
the Western Sahara are sharply split on whether they can put away
their guns and negotiate face-to-face, despite agreeing in
principle to peace.
   Morocco and the Polisario independence movement remain far apart
on most issues, said Bachir M. Sayed, an official of the
Marxist-led movement says.
   Sayed said Friday that both sides so far have only agreed on the
wording of a referendum on the future of the arid northwest African
territory, and on how voter eligibility will be decided.
   Sayed said issues dividing the two sides include the 185,000
Moroccan soldiers in the phosphate-rich territory; the Moroccan
administration; the tens of thousands of Moroccan settlers living
in Western Sahara; existing Moroccan law in the area; and ``direct
negotiations, still opposed by Morocco.

<HEAD>Market Bulls Emphasize Contrasts With 1987</HEAD>

   To ward off fearsome memories on the anniversary
of Black Monday, the watchword among Wall Street's optimists is
``things are different now.''
   Many followers of the stock market have been heartened in the
past few months to see the chart of the Dow Jones industrial
average diverge from the path it followed in 1929-30.
   For many months, there was an eerie parallel in market
fluctuations during the two periods. But recently the 1988 line has
turned up where the 1930 one headed down.
   ``The main reason is that the most recent crash was not rooted
in the kind of economic problems that existed in 1928 and 1929,''
maintains Greg Smith at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   The optimists also argue that much has changed in the past year
to allay fears of a repeat of the crash of 1987.
   ``The fundamental underpinnings of the market are vastly
changed, and for the better,'' says Norman Fosback in the
investment advisory letter Market Logic.
   ``A year ago, a fundamentally overvalued market was confronted
with a sudden and rather severe tightening of monetary policy,'' he
observed. ``The result was disaster.
   ``This October, the market has already discounted a tight money
policy.''
   Fosback also stresses that stock prices, by several longstanding
measures, aren't at the dangerously high levels they reached in
1987.
   Dividend yields on the stocks that make up the major market
averages got as low as 2.5 percent at the peak of the bull market
last year.
   ``Never before in the history of the U.S. stock market had
blue-chip stocks offered such low dividend returns,'' he says.
Yields now stand in the neighborhood of 3.7 percent.
   Price-earnings ratios of those same stocks, which surpassed 20
to 1 last summer, now hover around 12 to 1. Today's yields and PEs
``are at approximately normal levels,'' by Fosback's reckoning.
   ``Perhaps more importantly, if corporate earnings continue to
grow at their current pace and the market rises to last year's
high, PE ratios would still be below their historical norm.''
   In the past week, the market reached its highest levels since
the crash, but then settled back. Dow Jones's average of 30 blue
chips closed Friday at 2,133.18, down 17.07 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 1.35 to
155.46; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 1.08 to 384.59, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 1.27 at 302.55.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 147.05 million shares a day,
against 166.65 million the week before.
   Fosback says he is by no means arguing that stocks are at
deep-discount bargain levels right now.
   But he adds, ``the key consideration is that they are far from
overvalued. Strong bull markets began in 1966 and 1970 from PE
ratio levels that were actually higher than that which prevails
today.
   ``Obviously, October 19 COULD recur,'' he acknowledges. ``It
happened once; it can certainly happen again.
   ``The more meaningful question is, is it likely to happen any
time soon? To this, the answer must be a resounding no.
   ``Investors have no need to fear a near-term replay of Oct. 19,
1987. Indeed, current readings on the classic fundamental
indicators are fully consistent with a bull market scenario.''

   A soon-to-be released product called the CBOE 250 is so eagerly
anticipated that its introduction has been delayed to make sure
everyone who wants it can get it.
   No, it's not a car or a computer _ it's a new stock-index
futures contract, the first to be approved by federal regulators
since last year's stock-market collapse.
   It's also the first futures contract that will trade on the
floor of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the first major
offering of a joint venture between the CBOE and the Chicago Board
of Trade, the world's largest futures market.
   The Board of Trade and the CBOE, the world's largest options
exchange, expected about 200 of their members to sign up to trade
CBOE 250 futures. Instead, more than 500 people have expressed
their intention to participate in the market, forcing the exchanges
to postpone the contract's launch date from Nov. 1 to Nov. 11.
   ``This is the first time we've ever put off the launch of a
contract because of something like this,'' said CBOT spokesman Ray
Carmichael. ``It could even be that we'll have to put it off beyond
the 11th, but we still hope to launch it on that date.''
   The contract is based on the CBOE 250 stock index, which
measures the composite performance of the 250 largest stocks traded
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The futures contract will allow investors to speculate on the
index's performance by committing themselves to buy or sell a
basket of the underlying stocks for a specified price on a
specified future date.
   The most important feature of the new contract, according to
CBOE operations planner William Barclay, is that it will allow
players in the CBOE's popular stock index options markets to hedge
against losses there, thus reducing their risk and the overall risk
of the markets.
   A stock-index option gives the holder an option _ but not an
obligation _ to buy or sell a basket of stocks at a specified price
on a specified future date.
   An investor who has bet, via the options market, on a rise in
the stock market could hedge against a loss on that investment by
selling a CBOE 250 futures contract or vice versa.
   Because futures trading concepts may be unfamiliar to some CBOE
members, those who want to trade CBOE 250 index futures are
required to take a futures-trading course and pass a test
authorized by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal
agency that regulates U.S. futures and options markets.
   Meanwhile, members of the Board of Trade seeking to participate
in the new market are not allowed on the CBOE floor without first
attending orientation classes to learn about floor rules peculiar
to the exchange.
   All this processing and training is causing the hold-up in
launching the new contract, officials said.
   Although four other stock-index futures are traded on U.S.
exchanges _ with the most successful by far being the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's Standard & Poor's 500 contract _ the CBOE 250
will be the first launched since the stock market's collapse last
Oct. 19.
   The crash focused public attention on stock-index futures. The
Securities and Exchange Commission said certain types of
sophisticated trading activities involving index futures may have
accelerated the collapse.
   A handful of brokerage houses curtailed their involvement in
those trading activities _ called program trading and index
arbitrage _ in the wake of the publicity that developed.
   In index arbitrage, traders sell in one market while
simultaneously buying in another in an attempt to profit from the
constantly changing prices in both markets. One type of program
trading involves the use of computers for arbitrage trades of huge
blocks of stocks and stock-index futures contracts.
   Despite the withdrawal of a few firms from such activities,
analysts say index arbitrage and program trading now play an even
larger role in the financial markets because many smaller, less
sophisticated investors who fled the markets after the crash have
not returned.
   The CBOE 250 index futures will likely become just one more
avenue for arbitrage, said Jack Barbanel, director of futures
trading with Gruntal & Co. in New York.
   ``The only benefit I can see of that contract is that it
provides some interesting arbitrage opportunities between CBOE
options and the futures contract,'' he said. ``It will enable you
to use a combination of hedging and arbitrage strategies and that
is really its greatest marketing advantage.''

<HEAD>Future Uncertain for Texas Air Companies' High-Yield Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of Eastern Airlines' profitable shuttle
service to casino-hotel tycoon Donald Trump for $365 million in
cash titillated the airline industry and conjured up images of slot
machines aboard glitzy jets plying the Northeast corridor.
   Trump's deal with Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
announced this past Wednesday after a week of speculation, had more
practical effects, too.
   Among its more notable results, the sale of the three-city
shuttle gave a shot in the arm to the flagging ``junk'' bonds
issued by Eastern, its parent Texas Air and its sister carrier
Continental Airlines.
   But the longer-term outlook for the high-risk, high-yield issues
is less clear, analysts say. They warn that Lorenzo's desire for
liquid funds may have crippled Eastern's earnings potential.
   When word of talks on the shuttle between Trump and Lorenzo was
leaked in advance to the press, prices of the securities started
climbing, pushing their yields lower.
   ``The bond market knew this was coming,'' said Ray Neidl, a
senior bond analyst for McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei Inc.
   The yield on Texas Air's 14.25 percent issue due in 1993, for
example, had dropped to 15.87 percent this past Friday from nearly
17 percent before the leaks on the shuttle negotiations.
   The highly leveraged Texas Air (excluding its subsidiaries) has
a total of around $525 million in bond issues outstanding. Eastern
has nearly $700 million, while Continental has a hefty $1.8
billion. The latter includes securities issued by the now-defunct
New York Air and People Express, absorbed by Continental in
February 1987.
   After Trump and Lorenzo triumphantly proclaimed the shuttle sale
to reporters at Trump's tony Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, Standard &
Poor's Corp. announced that it was keeping a close eye on
Miami-based Eastern in the wake of the acquisition.
   Calling the $365 million anted up by Trump ``a generous price,''
the credit-rating agency said the interest on that sum could
recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling
the shuttle.
   Standard & Poor's had previously given Eastern's equipment trust
certificates, senior industrial revenue bonds and convertible
debentures ratings of single B, triple CCC and double CC,
respectively. The agency's announcement hinted that those ratings
might be raised in light of the shuttle sale.
   ``It's because they get a cash infusion at Eastern,'' noted
Michael Dahood, a corporate bond expert at Smith Barney, Upham & Co.
   That's the reason for the bullishness affecting the Texas Air
and Eastern issues. The sale, on which Eastern is expected to clear
about $240 million, gives Lorenzo a formidable war chest to
withstand a strike by Eastern's militant unions.
   The positive impact on Continental bonds is more subtle,
however. Lorenzo said he has been approached by financier Carl
Icahn, the wily chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., about
possibly buying the rest of Eastern.
   The shuttle sale signaled to the bond market that Lorenzo could
be open to the idea of unloading the rest of Eastern to Icahn or
another suitor _ a move that would focus Texas Air's energy and
cash on Houston-based Continental.
   Despite the bullishness, however, analysts warn that Texas Air
may have sacrificed Eastern's potential future earnings on the
altar of quick cash.
   ``They sold their best-performing asset,'' said Richard Bilotti,
a vice president of the high-yield bond department at Prudential
Bache Securities Inc. ``That's not a good thing for the long term.''
   Analysts have estimated that the shuttle has a potential cash
flow of around $70 million a year.
   A negative report of Eastern earnings or a strike at the carrier
could quickly knock down the prices of the bonds, Bilotti warned.
