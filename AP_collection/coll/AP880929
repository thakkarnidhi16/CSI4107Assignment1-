   Police shot and captured an armed
hijacker who wanted to crash a Boeing 737 with more than 100 people
aboard into a government building in the Brazilian capital
Thursday, officials said.
   The airliner hijacking left one person dead and four wounded in
the central Brazil city of Goiania, 850 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro and 150 miles northwest of Brasilia, the capital.
   The gunman was shot as he left the Boeing 737 and tried to board
a small getaway plane with a hostage after the rest of the
passengers and crew of VASP Flight 375 were released unharmed,
officials said.
   Authorities said the hijacker shot and killed the airliner's
co-pilot and wounded three other crew members. They described the
hijacker as mentally disturbed.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma told reporters in Goiania that
the hijacker received several bullet wounds throughout his body and
was in critical condition.
   Tuma identified the hijacker as Raimundo Conceicao, 28. Airport
officials said no Americans were aboard.
   The police chief said Conceicao told the control tower at
Goiania's Santa Genoveva airport that he wanted to ``slam the
Boeing 737 into a ministry building in Brasilia'' but later agreed
to take a smaller plane.
   Holding a .38-caliber revolver and taking the Boeing's pilot
with him, the hijacker descended from the jet parked on the runway
at the airport.
   A small Brazilian-made Bandeirantes plane was to take him and
the pilot to Brasilia, said air force spokesman Col. Eden
Avolinsque.
   The hijacker had demanded to talk to President Jose Sarney about
the country's economic policies, which he thought were wrong, said
Goiania police spokesman Morton Luiz.
   ``Police shot at him as he left the plane and he turned around
and shot the Boeing pilot, whom he had taken as his only hostage,''
Avolinsque told The Associated Press in Brasilia. ``He ran off into
the bushes, and police following close behind shot ... him.''
   Pilot Fernando Murillo Silva was shot in the leg, Avolinsque
said.
   ``We had orders from the president not to negotiate with the
hijacker and not to refuel the plane,'' Avolinsque said.
   Hundreds of heavily armed federal and state police and uniformed
army troops had surrounded the jet, isolated at the end of a
runway. VASP, a domestic carrier, is a Portuguese acronym for
Viacao Aerea Sao Paulo.
   VASP spokeswoman Mona Cury said Flight 375 was on its daily run
from the Amazon jungle city of Porto Velho to Rio on the southeast
Atlantic coast when it was hijacked.
   The hijacker ordered the airliner be flown to Brasilia but the
government refused to let it land, said Luiz. After nearly running
out of fuel, the jet landed in Goiania,
   ``He told the control tower he was against the economic policies
of President Jose Sarney and insisted on going to Brasilia. He
didn't make any other demands,'' Luiz said by telephone from
Goiania.
   Earlier, VASP and the Rio airport authority had reported a
passenger also was killed, but later denied the information.
   Tuma flew from Brasilia to Goiania to direct negotiations with
the hijacker. He said the man ``showed signs of mental
disturbance.''
   Luis Carlos Ferrini, a VASP employee at the Goiania airport,
said soldiers were taken to an identical plane to study it for a
possible invasion.
   Live TV reports from Goiania showed soldiers with rifles
creeping up to the plane and then running away.
   Avolinsque said the hijacker boarded the plane during a
refueling stop in Belo Horizonte, 290 miles north of Rio.
   ``About 20 minutes after takeoff, he got up and walked toward
the cockpit. A steward said, `That's not the toilet,' and the man
turned and shot him, injuring him in the head,'' Avolinsque said at
a news conference in the air force ministry.
   Avolinsque said the hijacker entered the cockpit, shot co-pilot
Salvador Evangelista in the head and a flight engineer in the leg
and ordered the pilot to fly to Brasilia.
   VASP said the plane carried 98 passengers and seven crew members.
   When the plane landed in Goiania in the early afternoon, the
hijacker permitted the injured crew members and another steward to
be taken from the plane.
   Evangelista later died, Luiz and air control officials said.

<HEAD>Bradley Unveils Plan to Cut Truck Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley on Wednesday proposed a
plan intended to cut the number of trucks traveling on highways
leading into the nation's second-largest city during peak traffic
hours.
   Bradley's plan, which will be submitted to the City Council for
approval, is intended to keep 70 percent of heavy-duty truck fleets
that normally operate during peak trafic hours off the road.
   Bradley was joined by rerpesentatives of the area's trucking
industry as he announced the plan. He said he did not blame
truckers for Los Angeles' traffic woes. But he said it was their
turn to help alleviate the traffic congestion that afflicts the Los
Angeles area.
   ``No one doubts that truck shipments are vital to our economy,''
Bradley said. ``The old saying `If you got it, a truck brought it,'
still largely applies. But there is no reason so many truck
deliveries must be made during these peak rush-hour travel times,''
Bradley said.
   The mayor's plan would allow only 30 percent of large truck
fleets to operate on city roadways from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4
p.m. to 7 p.m.
   The 30 percent of the trucks that fleet owners decide to operate
during peak hours would have to display a city certificate that
could cost up to $60. Stiff fines would be levied if a trucker
operated without the certificate.
   Trucks weighing 29,000 pounds or more would be subject to
certification under the Bradley plan.
   The $60 certificate fee would help fund a multi-agency ``rapid
deployment force'' that Bradley said would quickly clear snarled
surface streets and freeways of broken-down trucks and cars.
   The plan includes partial exemption for owner-operators of
single trucks. They are allowed to use city roads either in the
morning or the evening rush hour. The plan will also allow for a
case-by-case exemption.
   City sanitation turcks and certain hazardous materials
collection trucks also will be exempted under the Bradley plan.
   Although the plan will only allow 30 percent of the large-fleet
trucks that currently travel during rush-hour, analysts with the
mayor's office estimate the partial exemption for owner-operators
and the case-by-case examption will result in a cut of about 50
percent.

   British Columbia gave an art
contest, but nobody won. Jurors decided the entries just weren't
good enough.
   ``It was a difficult situation but it wasn't a difficult
decision,'' said Willard Holmes, director of the Vancouver Art
Gallery.
   Holmes was among the jurors who decided that none of the 380
entries deserved any of the $10,000 in prize money.
   But the show will go on. Even though prize money has not been
awarded, the 20-odd finalists will be displayed at an exhibition
opening Oct. 11.
   The contest was organized by the Federation of Canadian Artists
and sponsored by Canadian Forest Products Ltd.
   The theme of the competition, for which only British Columbia
artists were eligible, was ``water and its usefulness to
industry.'' About 380 entries by 300 artists were submitted.
   ``We didn't see any work which we felt we could support for the
prizes,'' Holmes said Tuesday. ``I had reservations about taking
part in this event and those reservations have been confirmed.''
   He said the jurors first looked at color slides of all the
entries and couldn't reach a decision. They then looked at the
originals of about 20 potential winners without success.
   Canada Forest spokesman Gordon Armstrong said his company was
disappointed with the jury decision but has told the artist
federation to keep the prize money and use it as it sees fit.

   Hundreds of people from around the
country want to buy the antiquated penny parking meters that lined
the streets of this Philadelphia suburb for more than 30 years.
   But officials say the proposed sale has turned out to be a big
headache.
   Initially, the township planned to trade in the 167 meters for
new ones, but decided to sell them after being flooded with
purchase requests, said John M. Schoenberg, the township's finance
director.
   ``If I had any idea (about the problems) I probably would have
thought twice,'' Schoenberg said Wednesday.
   The township council scrapped a plan last week to sell the
meters for $100 each through a lottery-by-mail after a resident
charged the proposal was unfair because it gave preferential
treatment to current and former residents, taxpayers and business
owners.
   The resident, Greg Leonberg, said the plan did not comply with a
state statute on the disposal of municipal property. The township
either must open up bidding for the meters, hold a public auction
or trade them in, he said.
   Because of the controversy, Schoenberg said, the township is
considering holding some form of bidding or auction.
   More than 600 prospective buyers have indicated they want a
meter, Schoenberg said.
   In August, the community of 16,000 residents replaced the
old-fashioned meters with nickel meters. The old meters, which
dated from the 1950s, took a penny for 12 minutes of parking. But
replacement parts became hard to find.
   Leonberg said he is even considering buying a meter, although he
said ``they have no value at all.''

   For most people, house-hunting is no
easy task. For Linda Asher and her 35 felines, it's become a
catastrophe.
   Asher thought she had found an ideal home a year ago when she
moved into a seven-room house with a big yard in North Braddock, a
Pittsburgh suburb with no law restricting pets.
   Asher said she told neighbors about the cats before she bought
the house and was told they would not be a problem.
   ``Maybe they really didn't believe me when I said I had 35
cats,'' she said.
   In July, District Justice Betty Lloyd found Asher guilty of
harassment after neighbors claimed the cats damaged their lawn
furniture and left paw prints on their cars. Asher has appealed to
Common Pleas Court.
   Asher concedes the cats wandered outside her yard despite a new
$3,800 fence that surrounds the home and is topped with an overhang
that slants inward.
   Neighbors have pressed for passage of a local pet ordinance, and
Council President Wayne Holt said the town's solicitor is drawing
up a measure.
   Frustrated over continuing problems, Asher, 47, an employment
training and placement specialist for the state, has put her house
up for sale.
   ``I've made a lot of sacrifices to keep my little family
together,'' said Asher, who also was evicted from an apartment in
Braddock because of the cats.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She may be a hit in her homeland, but
Miss Nicaragua is strictly a miss in the United States, a victim of
chilly relations between nations.
   ``Yankee Administration Behaves Worse Than A Fool. They Deny
Visa to the Belle,'' screamed a headline Wednesday in the
pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario.
   The newspaper said the reigning Miss Nicaragua, 19-year-old
Gabriela Robleto Barquero, was denied a U.S. visa this week to
enter Puerto Rico for an international beauty contest.
   But a U.S. Embassy official in Managua said not even beauty
queens can thaw the icy relations between Nicaragua and the United
States, which has since 1981 backed the rebels known as Contras who
are seeking to overthrow this country's leftist Sandinista
government.
   ``She is just one of thousands of Nicaraguans to whom we've been
unable to provide visa services because of the actions of the
Nicaraguan government,'' said the diplomat, speaking in a telephone
interview on condition of anonymity.
   ``The Nicaraguan refusal to issue visas to U.S. diplomatic
personnel prevents us from replacing our diplomats,'' he said.
``The embassy cannot function in a normal manner when Nicaraguan
actions are keeping us severely understaffed.''
   The embassy stopped issuing visas to Nicaraguans in July,
shortly after Nicaragua expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and
seven diplomats, accusing them of trying to undermine the
government. The United States responded by expelling Nicaragua's
ambassador and other diplomats.
   The U.S. Embassy official said Wednesday that the State
Department had in July requested official visas to replace the
eight ousted American diplomats. He said those requests were not
processed. American tourists do not need visas to enter Nicaragua.
   Miss Nicaragua is not the most prominent victim of the visa war,
however.
   The United States last week failed to process half of the
requested visas requested by President Daniel Ortega for a visit to
the United Nations in New York and the Organization of American
States in Washington.
   The State Department claimed the requests were made too late.
Ortega responded by canceling his trip.

   Here are brief sketches of the
astronauts who will fly aboard the space shuttle Discovery.
   NAVY CAPT. FREDERICK H. HAUCK, who has flown on two previous
shuttles since becoming an astronaut 10 years ago, will be
commanding the first shuttle to fly since the Challenger blew up
little more than a minute after it left the launchpad Jan. 28, 1986.
   Hauck, 47, said he has had plenty of time to dwell on Challenger
and won't be concentrating on that when he lifts off.
   ``There's no doubt I'll be looking at the screen, that when it
says 73 seconds and it's counting upwards, I'll know we've passed
that particular milestone. But it's not like I'm worried about
it,'' he said in a recent interview.
   The former Navy test pilot, who flew 114 combat and combat
support missions in Southeast Asia, piloted the Challenger in June
1983 and commanded Discovery in November 1984 when the crew made
the first space salvage mission in history, retrieving two disabled
satellites.
   Hauck grew up in Winchester, Mass., and Washington, D.C. He
received a bachelor's degree from Tufts University and a master's
in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   His wife, Dolly, and 25-year-old daughter, Whitney Hauck Wood,
planned to be at the launch, he said, but his 23-year-old son,
Stephen, a Navy officer, is stationed on a ship that was sent to
the Persian Gulf.

   AIR FORCE COL. RICHARD O. COVEY, an astronaut for nearly 10
years, will pilot the shuttle on which he logged more than 170
hours in space on a previous flight.
   The 42-year-old former Air Force fighter and test pilot guided
Discovery on an August 1985 mission and will be thinking about the
Challenger astronauts when he lifts off on his new mission.
   ``I'll also be knowing that they would be pleased that we have
gotten back to the point where we are going to fly again.''
   His wife, Kathleen, and daughters Sarah, 14, and Amy, 12 will
attend the launch.
   Covey was born in Fayetteville, Ark., and grew up in Fort Walton
Beach, Fla. His late father was an Air Force lieutenant colonel.
   He earned a bachelor's degree from the U.S. Air Force Academy in
1968 and a master's in aeronautics and astronautics from Purdue
University a year later.
   As an Air Force pilot, Covey flew 339 combat missions during two
tours in southeast Asia. He has flown more than 4,000 hours in more
than 25 different types of aircraft.

   MARINE LT. COL. DAVID C. HILMERS, an astronaut since 1980 and
veteran of one previous shuttle flight, will be a mission
specialist aboard Discovery.
   Hilmers' first space flight was in October 1985 _ the maiden
voyage of the orbiter Atlantis, on which he was a mission
specialist.
   On Discovery, he will help deploy a $100 million communications
satellite.
   Hilmers grew up in DeWitt, Iowa, and graduated with a bachelor's
degree in mathematics, summa cum laude, from Cornell College in
1972. He earned a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1977
and the degree of electrical engineer from the U.S. Naval
Postgraduate School in 1978.
   Hilmers said that like the other astronauts, he will be thinking
of their Challenger crew members.
   But, he added, ``I think that when it gets right down to the
last couple of minutes, that we're going to be looking up at the
sky and not behind us.''
   Hilmers and his wife, Lynn, have two sons, Matthew, 13, and
Daniel, 9.

   GEORGE ``PINKY'' NELSON is the only one of Discovery's five-man
crew who has walked in space.
   Nelson, 38, logged nine hours of space-walking on his first
flight, aboard Challenger in April 1984. His second mission, on
Columbia, began 16 days before the Challenger tragedy.
   On this launch, there are no plans for Nelson to walk in space,
unless something goes wrong in deploying a $100 million
communications satellite.
   He is again a mission specialist and this time has the duty of
blowing off an escape hatch and deploying a new escape pole for the
five men if an emergency occurs.
   ``On the one point, you have to be doubly focused on what's
happening. On the other hand you just have to be soaking in this
amazing experience,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Nelson, an astronomer, is the only one on the five-man crew
without a military background. He is the son of a high school
science teacher, grew up in Willmar, Minn., and earned a bachelor's
degree in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1972 and a master's
and doctorate in astronomy from the University of Washington in
1974 and 1978.
   His wife, Susan, and daughters, Aimee Tess, 16, and Marti Ann,
13, will be present for the liftoff.

   JOHN M. ``Mike'' LOUNGE, who first flew into space on Discovery
in August 1985, will again be a mission specialist on NASA's first
flight in 2{ years.
   This time aboard Discovery, Lounge, 38, a former Navy aviator,
is the lead astronaut in charge of deploying the $100 million
communications satellite.
   His other flight, which launched Aug. 27, 1985, is described by
NASA as its most successful shuttle mission so far, with astronauts
deploying three satellites and repairing an ailing satellite.
   Lounge, of Burlington, Colo., said the Challenger tragedy will
add to the anxiety astronauts always feel during the first few
moments after launch, Lounge said. But, he said, once the
spacecraft gets into space ``and it gets real quiet, my heartbeat
will probably go down quite a bit.''
   Lounge, a Colorado native, received a B.S. degree in physics and
mathematics from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1969 and a master's in
astrogeophysics from the University of Colorado.
   He completed a nine-month cruise in Southeast Asia aboard the
USS Enterprise and participated in 99 combat missions. He currently
is a member of the Texas Air National Guard and flies with his unit
at least once a week.
   He was selected as an astronaut in 1980.
   His family, including, his children Shannon, 17, Kenneth, 7, and
Kathy, 4, plan to be there for the liftoff.

   An appeals court in Czechoslovakia has
freed an activist who spent four months in prison for distributing
leaflets critical of the government, an emigre source said.
   Jaroslav Popelka began a hunger strike on Sept. 2, the day he
was convicted of disturbing the public peace, and was ill when the
appellate court in Brno ordered him freed on Tuesday, the source
said.
   Popelka, 32, had been sentenced to eight months in jail and
already had spent 21 weeks behind bars since his arrest, said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The appeals court on
Tuesday also reduced the charge against him to infringing on public
order.
   Popelka was arrested for passing out leaflets calling for
``genuine perestroika.'' Perestroika, or restructuring, is Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's term for his economic and political
reforms.
   Two human rights activists were arrested for unfurling a banner
that said ``Freedom for the political prisoner Jaroslav Popelka''
prior to the appeals court proceedings, the emigre said. They were
later released.

   A 30-day Soviet-French space mission in November
will include a space walk by cosmonauts from both countries and an
experiment designed to help choose building materials for a future
French spacecraft, Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said Wednesday that the space
flight, scheduled to begin Nov. 21, will have a more demanding
program than a previous Soviet-French orbital mission in 1982 that
only lasted eight days.
   Two French cosmonauts are vying for a position aboard the
November flight _ Jean-Loup Chretien and Michel Tognini. The Soviet
spaceman has not yet been named.
   Tass said the participants in the November mission are scheduled
to dock with the orbiting space station Mir and unfold a metal
contraption outside that could serve as the basic building block
for future space platforms.
   The cosmonauts will also leave a panel of materials outside the
Mir to test their performance in space. French scientists plan to
use the materials in building a French spacecraft, Tass said.

   Tired of teen-agers driving dangerously fast,
Judge James Foley came up with an ``educational punishment'' that
officials say may save lives by making the youths think twice.
   Youngsters convicted of going 80 mph or more in Macon County are
ordered to spend a day with high-speed accident victims, many
unable to move more than their eyeballs in the hospital beds where
they live out their lives.
   ``I've been on too many phone calls from the highway patrol
saying that some youngster was killed in a car wreck. I'm sick of
that,'' said Foley, a county prosecutor for 23 years before
becoming an associate circuit judge 1{ years ago. He is 53.
   ``I'm trying to reach youthful drivers who have 50 years ahead
of them. You expect kids to make mistakes, but if you let them do
nothing about it but mail in a fine, then what have you done to
modify their behavior?''
   Foley has sent about 30 speeders aged 16-21 to the University of
Missouri Health Sciences Center at Columbia for a day of talking to
doctors, nurses and other staff members along with some of the
patients. The youngsters then have to write an essay about what
they learned.
   If they fail to go to the hospital and write the essay, they
risk losing their licenses. The hospital trip does not keep them
from having to pay fines of $150-$200.
   ``I really chew on these kids so they'll know what they did,''
Foley said.
   Nobody making the trip to Columbia has reappeared before him for
speeding, the judge said, although one youth was later ticketed in
another county.
   In one essay, a 17-year-old boy who had been caught going 94 mph
summed up the effect of touring the intensive care unit, where
tubes and wires keep patients alive: ``This scene was more
disgusting than watching all of the Friday the 13th movies
consecutively.''
   He added, ``Although everyone makes mistakes, not everyone gets
by as easily as I did. Some people will pay for their high-speed
driving for the rest of their lives.''
   Another speeder wrote that he gave up his motorcycle: ``I have
lost my nerve and don't want to have my luck run out. I want to
live a long life.''
   At the hospital, the teen-agers get a picture of what happens
from the time a patient is admitted, through treatment and
rehabilitation, said Kathleen Cain, who runs the program and is
coordinator of the hospital's head and spinal injury prevention
project.
   ``They expect to see blood and guts and be frightened,'' she
said. ``The real reality for them is seeing somebody trying to
learn to eat or learn to speak. They see people doing things as
basic as learning how to comb their hair.''
   For the most part the patients are the same age as the speeders,
which Ms. Cain said has a profound impact on them.
   ``The day slowly grows on them. They don't come in and
immediately see something that'll knock their socks off,'' she
said. ``As the day goes on, they get quieter.''
   One turning point in their feelings, she said, is having lunch
with a 21-year-old quadriplegic. ``It makes a real impact on them.
He's pretty blunt with telling them what his life is like.''
   Ms. Cain and Foley said it is too early to assess the program's
impact on the speeders but both believe it is paying benefits.
   ``At least we can see where we get their attention and they
learn something,'' she said.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Researchers Try To Unlock Secrets Of Chinese Medicine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A university research center here has started
to unlock the secrets of the centuries-old Chinese tradition of
using herbs, deer antlers, dried seahorses and other exotica as
medicines.
   Some scientists believe the medicines could help improve modern
health care.
   Chinese medicine also has long been popular in Japan and sales
have boomed in recent years.
   ``Sales of herbs have gone up because they have preventative
functions and do not have side effects,'' said Lau Pun Cheung,
president of the 600-member Chinese Medicine Merchants Association
of Hong Kong.
   The Chinese Medicinal Material Research Center at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong was set up 12 years ago to investigate the
traditional prescriptions and disseminate its findings.
   The program involves compiling an exhaustive English-language
database on Chinese medicine and conducting experiments with
traditional prescriptions to determine their efficacy.
   ``We wish to open up this treasure house of information to
worldwide research,'' director Chang Hson-mou explained of the
center's computer system that stores botanical, chemical,
pharmacological and clinical reports of common Chinese herbs.
   The data is constantly updated with information from about 180
journals from China, he said.
   Chang acknowledged that some Communist Chinese authorities
originally resisted the program, claiming that giving foreign
researchers access to information about traditional medicine was
similar to giving away state secrets.
   They later backed down, Chang said, and the center now stores
more than 700 items used in Chinese medicine, including herbs,
ginseng (the white root of a carrot-like plant), shells, insects,
frog secretion, deer tails and minerals such as sulphur and gypsum.
   Scientists at the center are analyzing selected prescriptions
made of such material in search of active ingredients that could
provide clues to developing new drugs.
   Chang said researchers recently analyzed a series of popular
formulas known as ``anshen zhenjing,'' or tranquilizers, and
discovered an active ingredient with effects similar to the popular
Western drug Valium.
   ``Although these herbs have been used for generations, the
active component ... had not been uncovered,'' he said. The
center's scientists have learned how to synthesize the compound,
which has attracted the interest of five pharmaceutical companies.
   The center also is using modern detectors to examine herbs used
by Chinese hospitals for treatment of serious heart conditions such
as acute myocardial infarction _ the blocking of the heart vessel.
   ``This is not a placebo,'' Chang said of the prescription. ``The
result seems to be quite good.''
   Another project involves basic research into the use of Chinese
medicine to reinforce the body's immune system.
   ``This is a hot topic because of AIDS,'' Chang said, but he
cautioned that the center is not trying to develop a wonder drug to
cure that fatal disease. ``The Chinese immunology approach is to go
slow, to recover your natural balance,'' he said.
   The experiments are designed to separate the useless from useful
in Chinese medicine, Chang said. He expressed skepticisim, for
example, that any of the hundreds of traditional Chinese
prescriptions for hepatitis can be effective.
   ``We have analyzed only a few, but I am doubtful,'' he said.
   Chang said well over half the respondents to a 1983 university
survey said they used traditional medicine or acupuncture to
supplement Western medicine.
   Maurice Chung, general manager of Bristol-Myers (HK) Ltd., said
the U.S.-based international pharmaceutical company is keeping an
eye on the center's research.
   ``It could develop new leads,'' he said. ``It's new ground, a
new field.''
   Other programs in Hong Kong also are bringing traditional
Chinese medicine into the computer age.
   For example, the research institute of the local Chinese
Medicine Practitioners' Association has developed a system in which
a patient's symptoms are entered into a computer program that then
determined what traditional prescription would be best.
   The program is used primarily by junior practitioners to help
them learn the art of diagnosis, said Chan Ying-chee, president of
the institute.

<HEAD>Several Factors In Korean Clampdown As Games Near Their End</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South Koreans, world-class
friskers and scanners, are drawing their tight security net even
tighter around the Olympics as the sports spectacular heads toward
its final days.
   Seoul's tough-talking student radicals are threatening to
disrupt Sunday's marathon. A U.S. security specialist says his
biggest worry is the anti-Americanism surfacing among ordinary
South Koreans.
   One Korean official finds the real security threat coming from
the athletes themselves _ one might defect and put the Olympic
hosts in an awkward position.
   After 12 days of Games, the security concerns at Seoul are often
in the eye of the beholder. But by Wednesday everyone could see the
new Olympics-wide clampdown.
   For the first time, for example, police bomb-sniffing dogs were
deployed at the Olympic weightlifting hall. At the Olympic press
center, the security men blocked driveways with more steel
barriers, checked car trunks and undercarriages for bombs, and
closely searched visitors and journalists.
   ``We increased the vigil,'' one Olympic security official said.
   The tightening up coincided with Tuesday's announcement that an
anti-government student leader jailed since last week had been
formally charged under the tough National Security Law, which
covers sedition and similar acts.
   Oh Young-sik's followers have threatened to disrupt Olympic
events, including Sunday's men's marathon, a 26-mile run through
the heart of Seoul, unless he is freed.
   The marathon, vulnerable because of its length and route, is
expected to be well-guarded by police strung out along the
boulevards and by commandos trailing along in armored vehicles.
   But some questioned whether Seoul's militant students were the
main target of the stepped-up security, since the students favor
symbolic street clashes with police, rather than car bombs or other
terror blows against innocent civilians.
   Had authorities detected a sudden threat from international
terrorists, such as the shadowy, ultra-leftist Japanese Red Army?
   ``Categorically, no,'' said an American official who works
closely with the South Korean security authorities.
   This informant, who like most security officials here spoke on
condition of anonymity, suggested that the Koreans reinforced their
security apparatus simply because it had grown more lax since
opening day, Sept. 17. ``They had let their socks down a little
bit,'' he said.
   Of the Korean protective net, involving more than 100,000
security personnel, the American said: ``It's working. And not only
have there been no big plots, there have not even been attempted
plots. ...
   ``We're more concerned now about the mood swings of the Korean
people, the anti-Americanism.''
   Seoul newspapers have been flooded with letters and calls from
ordinary Koreans angry over the U.S. athletes' unruly, ``arrogant''
behavior during the opening ceremony, Americans' boisterous
cheering at sports events, the ``biased'' reporting by U.S. news
media of an Olympic boxing incident in which Korean officials
attacked a referee, and the theft of an expensive bar ornament by
two U.S. swimmers.
   On Tuesday night, another American got in trouble. Runner Johnny
Gray was arrested after he kicked a taxi door in a dispute with the
driver. He was later released.
   Meanwhile, down at the Olympic Village, where the athletes
reside, village Director-General Ryu Keun-ha has other things on
his mind.
   He told The Korea Times that his security people would
thoroughly check names of departing athletes against official lists
to ensure that none tries to defect.
   ``We will pay our utmost attention to prevent any undesirable
incidents,'' he was quoted as saying.
   In an unusual move, the Seoul government, eager to establish
relations with East bloc countries, has announced it will not grant
political asylum to any athletes who seek to defect.

   The state's highest court censured a district
court judge Wednesday for ``discourtesy, rudeness and sarcasm'' to
a woman involved in a domestic dispute case who later was slain by
her husband.
   The state Supreme Judicial court recommended private censure for
Somerville District Court Judge Paul A. Heffernan for his courtroom
treatment of Pamela Nigro Dunn, who was murdered by her husband,
Paul, in August 1986.
   Private censure involves no fine, penalty or loss of judicial
power.
   The case stemmed from charges by Mrs. Dunn's family that
Heffernan humiliated and belittled her in court hearings.
   The high court dismissed allegations of a pattern of such
conduct by Heffernan, noting that he granted Mrs. Dunn's request
for court protection from her husband. It said no connection
existed between Heffernan's courtroom demeanor and her murder.
   Heffernan, 55, of Boston, did not return phone calls seeking
comment. His attorney, Thomas Dwyer Jr. said the judge accepts the
SJC ruling.
   Carole Nigro, Mrs. Dunn's mother, called the ruling too lenient.
``I'm not saying he was the cause of her murder, but just the way
he handles women in court is wrong.''
   A central incident in the case stemmed from a March 14, 1986,
hearing before Heffernan in which Mrs. Dunn, who had been beaten by
her husband, sought permission to return to retrieve her clothes
from her husband's house.
   At that hearing, Heffernan interrupted Mrs. Dunn and said, ``I
don't think it's the role of this court to decide down to each and
every piece of underwear who owns what. As a matter of fact, I find
it a little ridiculous to be involved in it.''
   At a March 26, 1986, hearing with both husband and wife present,
Heffernan told Dunn, ``Let's get this matter resolved. O.K.? You
want to gnaw on her or she on you, fine, but let's not do it at the
taxpayers' expense.''
   Five months after that hearing, Dunn murdered his wife and
disposed of her body at a town dump. He has been convicted of
first-degree murder.
   Heffernan ``was rude and sarcastic during portions of the Dunn
proceeding. A single listening to the tape recording of those
hearings establishes those facts,'' the justices said in their
11-page ruling.
   The decision noted that Heffernan's ``loud, deep voice (and)
physically imposing manner,'' contributed to the intimidation of
Mrs. Dunn.
   The court said it was ``troubling for the future,'' that
Heffernan refused in testimony before the state Commission on
Judicial Conduct to admit his demeanor was intimidating.
   Dwyer, Heffernan's attorney, said Heffernan had voluntarily
withdrawn from domestic dispute cases and had no mmediate plans to
resume hearing them. And he said Heffernan has tried to tone down
the resonance of his voice in court.

   A former aide to Sen. Howard Metzenbaum was
indicted Wednesday on charges of accepting illegal payments from
Polish immigrants trying to become U.S. citizens and enter Ohio
State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, the FBI said.
   Ladd Anthony of Cleveland was indicted by a federal grand jury
for allegedly agreeing to accept $2,000 from Waclaw Pietrzykowsky
for helping get a friend of Pietrzykowsky's admitted to the
veterinary school, FBI Special Agent Marshall Sullivan said.
   The indictment also alleges Anthony accepted $300 for assisting
Irena Boc in gaining U.S. citizenship, Sullivan said. He said no
other Metzenbaum aide was involved in the allegations.
   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Wednesday he had notified the Justice
Department 22 months ago of the allegations a constituent raised
against Anthony.
   ``The FBI informed me that they completed their investigation of
Mr. Anthony in November of 1987,'' the senator said. ``Why has it
taken the Justice Department almost a year to seek the indictment
is a question that remains to be answered.''
   On July 19, 1987, the Justice Department reported the evidence
was credible enough to go to a grand jury and Anthony was fired,
Harris said.
   A spokesman for the Washington, D.C., office of the Justice
Department was unavailable for comment Wednesday night.
   Elmer Giuliani, Anthony's Cleveland attorney, said Wednesday he
had not received a copy of the indictment. ``I have to assume my
client is innocent,'' Giuliani said.
   Anthony lives in a Cleveland suburb but Giuliani declined to
give his address and the Cleveland telephone directory has no
listing for a Ladd Anthony.

<HEAD>Report Recommends Massive Changes in Medicaid Payments to Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Family physicians are grossly underpaid
relative to surgeons and other high-priced specialists, says a
long-awaited report laying the groundwork for potentially massive
changes in the way medicine is practiced in the United States.
   Ordered up by Congress three years ago, the 2,000-page survey
released Wednesday is certain to spark sharp debate in the medical
profession and beyond.
   If the study recommendations were applied immediately, heart
surgeons would suffer a 45 percent reduction in their Medicare fees
and general practitioners would receive a 65 percent raise.
   But because of the complex and emotionally loaded issues
surrounding any discussion of health care _ not to mention the
competition for dollars and cents _ no one is predicting an early
and literal application.
   That is not to say the preliminary skirmishing will not begin
immediately and be intense.
   Dr. William L. Roper, head of the federal agency that pays the
medical bills for more than 31 million elderly and disabled
Americans on Medicare, held out the prospect Wednesday that there
are some things a budget-conscious Congress ``might want to do in
1989 before the mega-debate'' is completed.
   For example, he said, Congress might use the study as a
rationale for trimming some Medicare-approved payments from the top
end of the scale without adding much or anything at the bottom end.
   ``Nobody is going to get 65 percent more from Medicare next
year, for example,'' he said.
   Even the father of the $2.3 million study told reporters it
would not be practical to implement its recommendations at once.
Harvard medical economist William C. Hsiao said a five-year phase
in period might be needed.
   Hsiao's study pointedly does not say any category of physician
is overpaid or underpaid in actual dollars and cents _ but rather
that the way they divide the financial pie is unfair and
potentially detrimental to sound medical treatment.
   Officially, it is entitled ``A National Study of Resource-based
Relative Value Scales For Physicians' Services.''
   In simplest terms, what Hsiao's work suggests is that if a
physician faces the option of performing surgery or using an
equally promising but less financially rewarding treatment, the
present fee system encourages surgery.
   His proposal would attempt to change that.
   ``You can predict that under the new system, doctors will be
willing to spend a lot more time with patients to examine and
counsel them,'' Hsiao said. ``Right now, physicians are being
penalized financially for spending time with patients.''
   Moreover, he said, the changes could encourage more young
doctors to go into primary patient care and lower the overall cost
of medical treatment.
   Roper, who heads the Health Care Financing Administration,
hailed Hsiao's work although he expressed reservations about
whether it should serve as the basis for a wholesale revision of
Medicare pay scales.
   Roper's agency contracted for the $2.3 million study. He said it
provides a scientific basis for ``what medical observers have known
for some time.''
   He cautioned that the new system advocated in the report would
not necessarily constrain overall medical costs _ which are rising
far faster than any other segment of the U.S. economy _ and ``could
worsen the ... problem if the resulting income redistributions
encourage those physicians who face fee reductions to increase the
volume or intensity of services.''
   Even though the impact of the report is likely to take years to
percolate throughout the health care system, the attention it is
generating within the profession is intense.
   The Journal of The American Medical Association is devoting its
entire next issue to the subject, and the AMA's house of delegates
will vote in December on whether to endorse Hsiao's plan.
   While the study originated with a Congress struggling to get a
handle on skyrocketing Medicare costs, it also could affect the way
private insurers determine how much they will pay for particular
services.
   And although doctors technically are not limited in how much
they charge by how much public or private insurance will pay, their
insured patients _ their customers _ become acutely aware of the
cost of medical care when they have to pay part of the bill out of
their own pockets.
   The first summaries of Hsiao's work, along with an editorial
commentary by Roper, appeared in The New England of Journal of
Medicine at the same time the study was formally delivered to HCFA.
   Hsiao tried to determine how much work is involved in 2,000
duties performed by doctors in 14 specialties. He and colleagues
took into consideration malpractice insurance premiums and other
costs, specialty training, time, mental effort, technical skill,
physical effort and psychological stress.
   For each task, he came up with a non-monetary value. For
instance, a comprehensive visit by a new patient to a family
practitioner is 248, while a well-baby visit is 64. An appendectomy
is 621, a pacemaker insertion is 620, and a triple coronary bypass
is 2,871.
   To figure out how much doctors will get, these values would be
multiplied by a monetary conversion figure. If the figure were $1,
for example, a well-baby visit would be worth $64 and an
appendectomy $621.

   This season the Metropolitan Opera will stage
all four operas in Wagner's Ring Cycle and on Wednesday, the third
night of the season, it presented the first one, ``Das Rheingold.''
   Casting was carefully done. As the Met chose singers who knew
the Handel style for its second-night ``Guilio Cesare,'' the
singers in ``Das Rheingold'' knew the Wagner style.
   Two were making very fine debuts. Hanna Schwarz of Hamburg,
Germany, sang Fricka, wife of Wotan, leader of the gods. The
mezzo-soprano, who has sung at Bayreuth since 1975, has the needed
volume and has her vibrato under control. Through much of the opera
she is concerned about her sister Freia and her voice always
sounded sympathetic, with a sweet overtone.
   Wotan, sung by Hans Sotin, has a dark voice that sounds full of
compassion, even when he's laying down the law. Seldom does one
hear this couple sound so understanding and kind.
   Mezzo-soprano Birgitta Svenden of Vuollerim, Sweden, made her
debut as Erda, who comes out of a hole in the ground near the end
of the opera to tell Wotan to surrender the ring. Her voice was
very clear and pleasing.
   Miss Svenden has sung at Bayreuth for four seasons. She will
sing Erda with the Seattle Opera in 1989 and for her debut at
Covent Garden in 1990. She has recorded Erda in ``Rheingold'' and
``Siegfried'' with James Levine and the Met Orchestra.
   Clarity ruled the evening. Levine conducted so that singers
could be heard. The Otto Schenk production, with sets and
projections by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen, new last October, is
lighted by Gil Wechsler so that singers can be seen. Almost
everybody sang clearly.
   Franz Mazura was outstanding as Alberich, who steals the gold
from the Rhine River and later puts a curse on anybody who wears
the ring he made from it. Siegfried Jerusalem as Loge had a
much-textured voice, rich but with a con man's inflections. Horst
Hiestermann's Mime was effective, though less squeaky than the
usual interpretation.
   John Macurdy and Matti Salminen were expansive vocally, as the
giants. Kaaren Erickson, Diane Kesling and Meredith Parsons blended
well as the Rhinemaidens.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Savings Plan Fails to Impress Many Analysts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's proposed tax break for saving
doesn't amount to much of a benefit, according to most analysts,
although one Washington economist says it could be an incentive for
new parents to set aside money for a child's college education.
   Under the right conditions, says John Makin of the conservative
American Enterprise Institute, after 20 years a savings account at
withdrawal using the vice president's proposal would have earned
22.5 percent more than under current law.
   But that assumes an account could earn 10 percent a year _ which
it generally would not now _ and that the family was in the 28
percent tax bracket, which would cut out a large number of families
that the proposal is designed to help.
   Joseph Minarik of the Urban Institute used a different
calculation and reached a decidedly less upbeat conclusion. ``I
don't think it is a good idea. The benefit to the saver is quite
small,'' he said.
   In addition, Minarik said, ``any benefit to the saver comes
dollar for dollar from the federal treasury.'' And because the
government is spending more than it takes in, enactment of the Bush
proposal would mean ``the government is borrowing so the individual
can save. Some might suggest that's not necessarily a wise thing
for the government to do.''
   Makin acknowledges that ``it's going to look a lot less
attractive if you are talking five years (of contributions rather
than 20) and a 15 percent tax bracket'' rather than 28 percent.
   ``It's better than nothing, but it's not going to change the
world dramatically,'' he says.
   According to Makin's calculation, a couple in the 28 percent
bracket fortunate enough to deposit $1,000 a year for 20 years and
earn 10 percent could withdraw $57,275 and, after subtracting the
$20,000 principal and paying tax, be left with $26,838. Without the
Bush incentive, the money would have earned $4,936 less, or $21,902.
   Bush offered the broad outlines of his proposal while
campaigning Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio. He billed the plan as an
incentive for low- and middle-income Americans to save more and,
thus, foster economic growth.
   Under the proposal, a taxpayer could set aside up to $1,000 a
year in an account, leave it intact for at least five years, and
earnings on the money would be tax-free until withdrawn. The full
$1,000 a year would be available only to people with adjusted gross
incomes of $50,000 or less. The benefit would decline as income
rises above that figure and disappear when income tops $60,000.
   The Bush proposal should not be confused with Individual
Retirement Accounts. Since the 1986 tax overhaul any worker not
covered by a company pension may contribute up to $2,000 a year to
an IRA and pay no tax on the contribution or its interest until
withdrawn. Workers who have a company pension and make less than
$50,000 may qualify for some deduction.
   But the big difference between IRAs and the Bush plan is the
deduction. Most workers may fully deduct their IRA contribution; no
one could deduct the annual contribution under the Bush proposal.
The only tax benefit would be deferral of taxes on interest earned
by the annual contributions.
   Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation has not analyzed the
Bush proposal but said that generally conservative organization
supports encouraging increased saving through tax incentives rather
than by raising taxes.
   Some in Washington are suggesting a federal sales tax to
encourage saving; they reason that since the tax would apply only
to money that is spent, most people with a choice would choose to
save.
   Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal
research organization, views the vice president's proposal as a way
to undo the tax overhaul enacted in 1986. ``This is just another
move to turn it around,'' he said.
   McIntyre calculated that the Bush plan would be worth an extra
$471 to a couple in the 28 percent bracket whose $1,000
contribution earned 10 percent a year for 10 years. ``What's the
point?'' he asked.
   He said the far more valuable IRAs are used by only 8 percent of
people at the $30,000 income level.
   ``Nobody uses them because they don't have the money, and they
wouldn't have the money for the less attractive'' accounts that
Bush proposed, McIntyre said.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Signs Deal To Import Chinese Hogs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   If animal scientists have their way, American
consumers some day may be eating bacon that has its roots in China.
   The Agriculture Department says a ``historic agreement to import
Chinese breeding swine'' has been reached and that the pact may
help upgrade the U.S. pork industry.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Wednesday the contract
involves USDA's Agricultural Service, China's ministry of
agriculture, and the Chinese National Animal Breeding Stock Import
and Export Corp.
   The imports will include 144 pigs of the Meishan, Ming and
Fengjing breeds, he said. The animals will be used in research
studies under a cooperative agreement with the USDA's meat animal
research laboratory at Clay Center, Neb., the University of
Illinois, and Iowa State University.
   No other details of the agreement were announced, but a
department spokesman, Jim Greene, said the financing arrangements
were handled by the two universities.
   Myers, a hog farmer from Missouri, said China has about 100
breeds of swine that represent a ``unique reservoir of unexplored
germplasm'' that could offer potential benefits for the U.S.
industry. Germplasm is semen and other genetic material.
   ``This unexploited source ... could prove to be very valuable to
the U.S. research programs on resistance to diseases, parasites and
improvement of some production traits,'' he said. ``China has a
long history in the domestication of pigs that can be traced back
for at least 6,000 years.''
   According to USDA reports, China also is the world's largest hog
producer. At the end of 1983, for example, China had an inventory
of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million for the United
States at that time.
   A goal of the import program is to cross the Chinese breeds with
U.S. breeds to increase litter size, and at the same time maintain
the quality and lean yield of pork. The breeds being imported have
three to four more pigs per litter than the average U.S. breed.
   The animals will be imported in late March 1989 after spending
60 days in quarantine in China and meeting other health
requirements. They will be quarantined again for 120 days at USDA's
animal import center in Fleming Key, Fla., before being released
for research.
   Roger J. Gerrits of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said scientists hope to conduct at least five years of
research to evaluate the animals and determine if they should be
released for use by the U.S. swine industry.
   Gerrits said that U.S. swine geneticists recognized the
potential value of Chinese swine more than 10 years ago, but
``satisfactory health and quarantine requirements were not
completed'' until last year.
   ``The three breeds selected for the research studies are highly
prolific,'' he said. ``U.S. geneticists estimate it would take at
least 30 generations of conventional selection to increase the
litter size of the average U.S. swine breed to the level routinely
produced by these Chinese breeds.''

   The Agriculture Department says it has resumed
research into the growing and use of kenaf, a fibrous plant that
can be used to make paper, after a decade of being on the back
burner.
   Howard E. Waterworth, coordinator of kenaf research for USDA's
Agricultural Research Service, said Wednesday that $300,000 is
being spent this year in kenaf studies through agency laboratories
in Lane, Okla., and Weslaco, Texas. Another $300,000 is scheduled
for 1989.
   ``Industry trials, including test runs by several U.S.
newspapers, indicate that pulp from kenaf makes newsprint paper
that is as sturdy as woodpulp paper but generally is brighter,
consumes less ink and has less ink ruboff,'' Waterworth said.
   Kenaf can be grown in southern U.S. states such as Texas,
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and California, he said. The plants
grow 15 to 18 feet in height in less than five months and can reach
about 22 feet. An acre yields 7 to 10 tons of dry fiber.
   The Peoria (Ill.) Journal-Star in 1977 was the first newspaper
to make a press run on kenaf newsprint. At least eight other
newspapers have had similar tests, including the most recent in
July 1987 at the Bakerfield Californian.
   Agency research on kenaf was suspended in 1978 when supplies of
paper pulp were plentiful and prices were down, Waterworth said.
   The USDA has spent about $900,000 to support commercial
development of kenaf through private industry since 1986, and the
new funds for research are expected ``to give additional support''
to that enterprise, he said.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
250,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery during the coming
year, says the Agriculture Department.
   The sale, announced Wednesday, raised total corn sold to the
Soviets in the last four weeks to more than 3.75 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn. The 250,000 tons of corn would be about 9.85 million
bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $26 million.
   A five-year long-term grain agreement with the Soviet Union will
expire Sept. 30 and negotiators are trying to work out a new one,
or at least an extension of the current agreement.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Moving On Law To Tighten Controls On Medical Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is preparing to force the
Environmental Protection Agency to combat a mounting wave of
infectious medical waste washing up on the nation's shores.
   The latest step in the process came Wednesday when the House
Energy and Commerce Committee gave voice-vote approval to
legislation that would require creation-to-disposal controls on
things such as used syringes.
   The action all but guaranteed that before adjourning next month
Congress will respond to the tides of used syringes and
AIDS-contaminated materials that appeared this summer in Lake Erie
and at beaches in New York and New Jersey.
   The bill, which backers say will be passed next week by the full
House, is similar to legislation approved in August by the Senate.
Staffers on both sides of the Capitol say they expect no problems
resolving differences between the two plans.
   ``The illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an
epidemic,'' said Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, principal sponsor of
the House bill. ``Much of this waste is infectious. It can
literally kill people. All of it is repulsive and frightening.''
   Luken said that in Youngstown, Ohio, a physician put used
syringes in a trash bin. ``Kids found the needles and played
`doctor' with them, giving each other injections that could have
proved fatal.''
   The legislation would require EPA to set up a system to track
infectious medical waste generated in New Jersey, Connecticut and
the eight states bordering the Great Lakes.
   However, the regional demonstration program could become
national in scope because any state would be allowed to opt for
coverage under rules that would require a paper trail from waste
generation to disposal.
   ``Tracking helps stop midnight dumping,'' Luken said.
``Hospitals and clinics will now know where their medical waste is
going, and so will EPA.''
   The bill proposes stiff penalties: a civil fine of up to $25,000
for each day of violation and a maximum criminal penalty of 15
years in prison and a daily violation fine of up to $50,000.
   Committee members said Congress is being forced to act because
EPA had failed to issue regulations _ first proposed 10 years ago
but then quickly dropped _ ensuring proper disposal of waste
created in hospitals, laboratories and clinics.
   ``This is not just a question of a bloody syringe washing up on
a beach on the East Coast,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``The
medical waste system in this country is broken and inefficient and
is regurgitating what it can't keep down.''

<TEXT>
   A New Jersey consultant charged with insider
trading involving a Navy contract discussed the project with a Navy
assistant secretary who has been named as a target in the
government's defense procurement probe, according to the
consultant's attorney.
   Charles A. Mills of Beachwood, N.J., who had served as a
consultant to the Navy in a project to develop a new generation of
blimps, agreed Wednesday to pay $9,315 to settle a civil complaint
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in U.S. District
Court.
   The SEC said it was continuing its investigation, and its
complaint cited a meeting between Mills and ``a certain then
assistant secretary of the Navy,'' whom it did not identify further.
   However, sources speaking on condition of anonymity indicated it
was Melvyn Paisley, who was assistant secretary of the Navy for
research, engineering and systems, and has since been named as a
target of a Justice Department probe into Pentagon purchasing
practices.
   Lawrence Barcella, Paisley's attorney, said his client has not
been subpoenaed or otherwise notified by the SEC that he is the
subject of an investigation. Moreover, he said the SEC complaint
does not imply that the unidentified assistant secretary did
anything improper.
   According to the SEC complaint, Mills, in his role as a
consultant from February to May 1987, had access to confidential
information about competing bids for a contract worth $168.9
million to develop a prototype of a radar-surveillance blimp to
help protect Navy fleets.
   Through meetings with Naval officials, including one on March
13, 1987 attended by the unidentified assistant secretary, Mills
learned the officials favored a bid from a joint venture of
Westinghouse Electric Co. and Airship Industries Ltd. of
Cardington, England, the SEC alleged.
   John D. Schupper, Mills' attorney, said his client told him
Wednesday that he met once with Paisley and other officials for
five or 10 minutes, but was not certain of the date.
   The Navy announced the contract award June 5. A day earlier,
according to the SEC, Mills purchased receipts on the
over-the-counter market in the United States for the purchase of
Airship Industries stock, which is traded in London and Sydney,
Australia.
   Mills sold the receipts June 8 and 9, earning a profit of
$4,658, the agency said. Without admitting or denying the charges,
Mills agreed to return the profits and pay an equal amount as a
penalty.
   The SEC also said ``certain assistant secretaries of the Navy''
were briefed on the bid award June 3 and 4. By that time, Paisley,
who was appointed assistant secretary in 1981, was out of
government, according to Barcella.
   The blimp contract had a potential value of $3 billion if the
Navy had decided to build a fleet of airships. However, the program
was scrapped following agreement between the Reagan administration
and Congress in late 1987 on a plan to reduce the federal budget
deficit.
   Schupper said Mills had not believed he did anything wrong and
cooperated fully with the SEC.
   ``In light of his health and his financial resources, he
believes that the settlement represents a fair resolution of
conflicting conclusions drawn from basically the same facts,''
Schupper said.
   The Justice Department is investigating whether private
consultants, many of them former Pentagon employees, paid bribes to
Defense Department officials for inside information about
contracts, chiefly within the Navy. The probe became public in June
after subpoenas were issued in the case. No one has been charged
yet.
   Investigators have searched Paisley's home looking for evidence
that he took payments from defense contractors while he was at the
Pentagon. Investigators also have alleged in court papers that
while Paisley was a consultant to McDonnell Douglas Corp., he
improperly provided the company with secret Pentagon documents
about its competitors.
   Through his attorney, Paisley has said the government has
provided no evidence to support such allegations.

<HEAD>Congress May Complete Its Spending Bills On Time _ For a Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and the White House may be about to
accomplish something they've not done since Harry Truman was
president _ enact all federal spending bills before the start of
the fiscal year.
   Although it's not likely to spark a giddy citizenry into
launching fireworks, approval by Saturday of all 13 spending bills
would be a political coup for both parties.
   It's already inspired people on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue
to begin publicly patting themselves on the back.
   ``We're showing that we can govern,'' Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the No. 3 House Democratic leader, said Wednesday.
   ``The warning has been taken to heart,'' said President Reagan.
He was referring to a promise he made in January that if the
spending measures were wrapped into a single piece of legislation,
he would veto it.
   As the start of the new fiscal year approaches, lawmakers and
the administration are working out disputes that in ordinary years
could take weeks or months to resolve.
   Thus, Reagan, who signed his first appropriations bill for the
new year on July 19, signed the sixth into law Wednesday, a measure
appropriating $8.8 billion for military construction.
   In addition, a $15 billion spending measure for the Commerce,
Justice and State departments and a $10.8 billion transportation
bill were on his desk. Legislative action on the five remaining
appropriations measures was scheduled for today and Friday.
   This is no ordinary year. It's an election year, and Republicans
and Democrats want to avoid any blame for a replay of last year's
budget embarrassment.
   ``In an election year, neither side wanted to face
responsibility for a massive CR,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
using the initials for ``continuing resolution'' _ legislative
lingo for a giant spending bill.
   ``This helps incumbents, period,'' said Coelho. ``The more you
make the process work, the more you help incumbents.''
   Last December, after a year of inconclusive squabbling between
Congress and the White House, Reagan signed a 1,400-page, $600
billion behemoth that contained all the money federal agencies
needed to function this year. Within hours of receiving it, the
president signed it. The alternative was shutting down the
government.
   In January, an angry Reagan used his nationally televised State
of the Union address to promise to veto any similar bill this year.
Congressional leaders called on the president to work with them to
smooth out any disputes that might arise, and pledged to avoid a
catchall measure for 1989.
   The most serious stumbling block this year had been defense
spending.
   But on Wednesday, Congress and the White House resolved a
long-running dispute over Star Wars and arms control restrictions
with both the House and Senate approving a Pentagon authorization
bill. That made congressional action possible by Friday on a
separate $300 billion Pentagon spending measure.
   The quicker-than-usual action this year is due in part to last
fall's budget summit agreement between Reagan and congressional
leaders. In that pact, both sides agreed to broad spending totals
for 1989, leaving only less-sweeping issues to be worked out.
   Coelho and other Democrats are crediting their own leadership
for the rapid movement of the spending bills.
   ``We announced at the beginning of the year that we'd do it,''
Coelho said.
   Even if all 13 bills are not enacted by 12:01 a.m. Saturday,
there would be little immediate impact. Federal workers deemed
essential _ including the military _ would be permitted to work
over the weekend. Government agencies would not have to shut down
unless spending legislation was not in place by Monday.

<TEXT>
   For President Reagan, his trip to New York for
the United Nations General Assembly meant a dramatic farewell
appearance. For fellow guests at his hotel, it meant something of a
nuisance.
   For reporters and photographers, it meant scrambling up and down
stairwells, waiting in line in a hotel kitchen and getting stuck in
an elevator.
   Reagan spoke at the U.N. on Monday, making his seventh
appearance there and his last before he leaves office in January.
   After his speech, he went to the United States Mission to the
United Nations for lunch. It's just across the street, so most
people would walk. Presidential security, however, required that he
make the crossing by motorcade.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Then it was off to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a few blocks away.
   The Waldorf had warned its guests of what was coming.
   ``It is my great pleasure to tell you that President Ronald
Reagan will be staying in the Waldorf Towers during your stay in
the hotel,'' manager Richard J. Cotter said in a letter handed out
at the registration desk.
   ``Unfortunately, however, it may mean some inconvenience for
you,'' Cotter added. ``To ensure the president's safety, the Park
Avenue entrance will be closed from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Monday
evening. Please be so kind as to enter and exit the hotel from the
Lexington Avenue area.''
   One woman entering the hotel from Lexington Avenue still found
herself inconvenienced when she was asked by a White House aide to
step aside while the traveling pool of journalists made their way
through the door.
   ``But we're staying here,'' she protested.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Once inside, the pool was taken by elevator to a holding room on
the 33rd floor to wait until it was time to walk up three floors to
where the president was holding the first in a series of meetings
with foreign leaders.
   After a brief picture-taking and question-asking opportunity,
the scribes scrambled back down to the holding room to file stories
by telephone and wait for the next meeting.
   In a few minutes, however, a harried assistant manager of the
hotel showed up to announce that the room set aside as the holding
room turned out to be part of a suite rented to a permanent hotel
guest. So it was out in the hall for the reporters and their
telephones.

<TEXT>
   The next event after the series of meetings was an evening
reception in a room decked with magnificent crystal chandeliers. To
get to it, reporters were ushered through the kitchen, past tray
after tray of dirty dishes, before standing in line to have
security officers check their equipment.
   Next morning, reporters were assembled in their third-floor
press room and taken to three elevators for the ride back up to the
33rd floor to wait for more meetings. At the ninth floor, one of
the elevators got stuck for 10 minutes.
   Word of the mishap apparently even got to the president.
   When the media people arrived on the 36th floor for Reagan's
meeting with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan of Pakistan, the
president told them, ``You seem like you've been breathing hard.
I'm trying to pick out the ones who had to walk up the stairs.''

<HEAD>Reagan Vetoes Textile Bill _ Sponsors Hoping for Override</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers are mapping efforts to override
President Reagan's veto of tightened curbs on textile, apparel and
shoe imports, but they concede it will be difficult.
   ``It's going to be an uphill fight but it can be done with a lot
of hard work and a little luck,'' Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., said
Wednesday after Reagan vetoed the measure and called it an example
of ``protectionism at its worst.''
   At a Rose Garden ceremony Wednesday, Reagan also signed
legislation to phase out virtually all tariffs between the United
States and Canada. The Canadian Parliament has yet to give final
approval to the measure, and as a result it is uncertain whether
the free-trade plan can be launched next year as scheduled.
   The textile bill, designed to protect American companies from
foreign competition, would freeze textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels for the rest of the year and limit subsequent growth to
1 percent a year.
   It would freeze non-rubber footwear imports at 1987 levels with
no provision for any increase in market share for foreign producers.
   Expanded market share, however, would be the reward of countries
that bought more U.S. agricultural products. That's a sweetener
designed to win over Farm Belt lawmakers wary lest Asian
textile-producing countries retaliate against the stiffened import
limits by slashing purchases of American wheat and feed grains.
   Reagan called the U.S.-Canada pact ``a hallmark of free trade''
and the opposite of the textile legislation he had just vetoed.
   ``Protectionism does not save jobs,'' Reagan declared. He said
the bill ``would have disasterous effects on the U.S. economy.''
   ``It would impose needless costs on American consumers, threaten
jobs in our export industries, jeopardize our overseas farm sales
and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for
U.S. exports,'' Reagan said.
   ``At a time when American exports are booming, the United States
must not embark on a course that would diminish our trade
opportunities,'' he said.
   He added that the measure could ``break the clothing budgets of
many American families.''
   On Capitol Hill, a House override effort was tentativeliy set
for next Tuesday. In votes thus far, however, sponsors have never
mustered the two-thirds they need to pass the measure into law over
Reagan's objections.
   The House approved the bill 248-150 on Friday. Earlier, the
Senate passed the measure 59-36. Sponsors said they now were
perhaps eight votes short of what they need and vowed to mount a
last-ditch effort to turn the tide.
   Democrats were quick to pounce on Reagan's second veto of
textile trade legislation in the last three years. They have been
portraying the measure as designed to shield blue-collar workers
from layoffs brought on by burgeoning textile and apparel imports.
   ``Maybe Ronald Reagan will be remembered as a great president,''
said Derrick. ``But not by the American textile worker.''
   ``The Reagan administration likes to pretend that it was an
innocent bystander to the foreign assault on our textile, apparel
and footwear industries, but that's not true,'' said House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas. ``In failing to implement the trade laws, the
White House has been an accessory to the assault.''

<HEAD>Anti-Porn Measure Creates New Crimes, New Punishments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New crimes and new punishments are created in
an anti-pornography measure approved by the Senate, including life
prison terms for child selling and $250,000 fines for transmitting
obscene dial-a-porn messages.
   The chamber voted 97-0 to approve the obscenity measure, tacking
it onto a controversial family leave bill with an uncertain future.
Final action on the two-part bill was expected late today.
   The unanimous vote on the obscenity amendment followed hours of
senatorial hand-wringing over child porn profiteers, a few
constitutional reservations and several references, veiled and
unveiled, to the demands of a political season.
   ``Those who vote against this ought to do so at their own
peril,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``It's time for the U.S.
Senate to set the standard in this area, for us to stand up and do
what we should do, and I know that everybody in this body
recognizes this filth problem.''
   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., makes
it easier to prosecute crimes and secure civil penalties in cases
involving child pornography and obscene materials. The measure also
sets stiff fines and prison terms, including 20 years to life for
buying or selling children for use in child pornography.
   It was added to a bill requiring large companies to offer at
least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to employees with
medical crises or new babies. Thurmond has been among the
conservatives leading the charge against the leave bill.
   But Thurmond and Hatch complained that although the child
pornography bill had 45 co-sponsors, other members blocked it from
coming up in the Judiciary Committee for seven months. They said
this was the only way to bring it to the floor.
   The Thurmond amendment would:
   _Ban buying and selling of children for use in child pornography.
   _Ban the use of computers to distribute or advertise child
pornography.
   _Require producers of sexually explicit material to document the
ages of persons appearing in the material.
   _Give states clear authority to regulate obscene or indecent
programming on cable and subscription television services. This
would overturn a Supreme Court decision.
   _Raise the maximum penalties for transmitting obscene
dial-a-porn messages from six months in jail and a $50,000 fine to
two years and $250,000.
   _Make it illegal to sell or possess obscene material or child
pornography on federal lands. Individuals could be fined up to
$5,000 and sentenced to six months in jail for possession; up to
$250,000 and two years in jail for sale.
   _Make it easier for prosecutors to file civil forfeiture suits
against people possessing obscene materials and set fines of up to
$250,000 for people who possess obscene material in violation of
obscenity statutes.
   Not voting on the measure were Sens. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and
Dan Quayle, R-Ind., the two vice presidential nominees, and Spark
Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., cited several areas of constitutional
concern including what he called the ``very troubling'' federal
lands provision.
   He said it would encompass the entire Virgin Islands and Indian
territory, national parks, military bases and federal buildings.
The Senate is trying to protect children, ``not trying to reach a
soldier who has an obscene book in his car,'' Specter said.
   But Thurmond insisted his bill is constitutional and said
Congress shouldn't waste time quibbling. ``We are trying to ban
obscenity,'' he said. ``If you want to protect the children of this
country, you've got to take a stand.''

   Social Security, in sickness and in health,
has been one of the Democratic party's most potent political
weapons of the 1980s.
   This election, like the past two, finds the Democratic candidate
accusing his Republican rival of harboring malevolent intentions
toward the program that 38 million retirees, disabled workers and
their dependents rely on.
   The Social Security issue was of scant help to Jimmy Carter and
Walter Mondale against Ronald Reagan, but Michael Dukakis is hoping
that this fall it will give voters pause about backing George Bush.
   The $210 billion retirement and disability program, on the verge
of bankruptcy five short years ago, now is piling up huge
surpluses. Its trust funds which grew to $69 billion last year,
will add $40 billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to $646
billion by the end of 1995.
   Dukakis, in last Sunday's debate, accused Bush of planning to
``raid the Social Security trust fund'' to help reduce the deficit
and pay for tax cuts and Pentagon weapons.
   Bush has said repeatedly he will not touch Social Security. It
is the one program he plans to exempt from his ``flexible freeze''
to curb the deficit.
   A Bush spokesman, David Sandor, dismissed Dukakis' raid charge
as ``an effort to terrorize America's elderly into political
submission.''
   The Republican commissioner of Social Security, Dorcas Hardy,
points out that Dukakis recently used $27 million in surplus
pension funds to help balance the Massachusetts budget.
   Social Security didn't save Carter or Mondale, but Sen. Bob
Dole, R-Kan., said it was the issue that cost Republicans control
of the Senate in 1986.
   Dukakis advises, ``When it comes to Social Security and George
Bush, don't read his lips, read his record.''
   As president of the Senate, he cast a tie-breaking vote on May
9, 1985, against exempting Social Security's cost-of-living
adjustment from a fiscal 1986 budget freeze. The tally was 50-49.
   That freeze never materialized. Reagan, after initially
supporting it, abandoned the package and it died. Afterwards, he
adopted a hands-off policy toward Social Security that he has stuck
to _ and which Bush promises to emulate.
   In 1981, in the throes of Social Security's difficulties and in
his quest to cut federal spending, Reagan sought sweeping cuts in
benefits for early retirees and others. Congress eliminated college
students' benefits and some others, but refused to go along with
the steepest cuts.
   In this campaign, as in 1986, Mr. Senior Citizen himself,
88-year-old Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida, will be on
the airwaves attacking the Republicans on Social Security. The
National Council of Senior Citizens is running Pepper ads attacking
Bush and distributing posters that scream, ``Bush whacked my Social
Security on May 9, 1985.''
   Dukakis has charged that Bush would have to ``raid the trust
fund'' if he is serious about reducing the deficit while buying
more military weapons and cutting the capital gains tax.
   In fact, the growing trust funds already help reduce the deficit.
   Although Social Security's trust funds technically are listed
apart from the government's other accounts, they are lumped
together for purposes of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   Federal law prohibits spending Social Security's reserves on
other programs, but every dollar added to the trust funds reduces
the overall deficit.
   And since the trust funds must be invested in interest-bearing
U.S. securities, they reduce the amount the government must borrow
in private markets. The government uses the funds generated by
selling bonds to Social Security to cover the operating deficit in
the rest of its programs.
   Still, there have been calls for changes in Social Security
outside the immediate political debate.
   Bush's two main economic advisers, Martin Feldstein and Michael
Boskin, have been prominent academic critics of Social Security.
   Feldstein has argued that Social Security depresses private
savings. He also has proposed restricting cost-of-living increases
to the Consumer Price Index minus 2 percentage points.
   Boskin, in a 1986 book, ``Too Many Promises: The Uncertain
Future of Social Security,'' proposed to revamp Social Security to
separate its insurance and welfare aspects.
   Robert Strauss, the former Democratic party chairman and
co-chairman of the National Economic Commission, touched off a
firestorm Sept. 20 when he said that if the budget is to be
balanced, then ``we have to go to Social Security, Medicare and
entitlements generally and we have to go to defense.'' Both the
Dukakis and Bush campaigns disavowed Strauss' statement.
   Other Democrats have spoken favorably of making more retirees
pay income tax on their benefits. Only one retiree in 10 now is
taxed on Social Security.

<HEAD>First Revision of Pesticide Safety Law in Decade Gets Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first major revision of the nation's
pesticide control law in a decade is headed for President Reagan's
desk with praise from lawmakers and lukewarm support from
environmentalists.
   ``After 10 years we've seen a major breakthrough,'' Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., said at a news
conference Wednesday following Senate approval on a voice vote.
   The measure cleared the House last week and sponsors expected no
problem with the administration over the measure, which would
accelerate safety reviews of potentially hazardous chemicals
sprayed on crops.
   The bill, designed to speed the banning of pesticides too
dangerous for use, would set a nine-year deadline for finishing
Environmental Protection Agency reviews of some 600 active
pesticide ingredients.
   Completion of the work would not come until the year 2024 at the
present pace, according to the General Accounting Office.
   The bill also would take a sizeable financial load off taxpayer
shoulders and hand it to pesticide manufacturers. Most government
indemnities to companies for banned chemicals would be phased out.
The industry would pay for the safety reviews as well as a large
portion of storage and disposal costs.
   The measure also would reauthorize for three years the 1947
Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, which got its
last facelift in 1978. Since then, a decade of efforts to speed up
the safety reviewing process has produced nothing more than
political snarls.
   Environmentalists have been calling for tightened pesticide
controls for more than two decades amid evidence that some of the
2.6 billion pounds a year of chemicals sprayed on crops can cause
cancer, birth defects and other health problems. Eventually, the
pesticides find their way to American dinner tables.
   Lawmakers did not paint the bill as a full-scale answer to the
pesticide issue. Missing was any effort to cope with the problem of
pesticide contamination of groundwater, which provides the basic
drinking supply for an estimated 113 million Americans.
   Seventy-three pesticides have been reported in groundwater in 34
states, the Capitol Hill-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group
reported recently after examining EPA records. The agency says it
is now trying to determine the extent of contamination with a
nationwide survey.
   Lawmakers held out the possibility Wednesday that they could
tackle the groundwater program when Congress returns to Washington
next year.
   ``Now we have to tie together our agricultural programs and our
environmental goals and enact a groundwater program to protect the
health of the American people,'' said Leahy. He had backed
inclusion of groundwater features but was unable to command a
majority on the Agriculture Committee.
   Flanking Leahy at a news conference, Sen. Richard G. Lugar,
R-Ind., said groundwater provisions ``are on the agenda'' for next
year.
   ``It has much more of a constituency than it had before,'' Lugar
said. ``Before it was much more of an environmental interest. Now
it has considerable farm interest.''
   Environmentalists were lukewarm in their assessment of the bill.
   ``As passed, the bill does not even qualify for a bronze
medal,'' said Rick Hind of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
``On a scale of one to ten this deserves a three. ... It gives
Congress another excuse to postpone important items like
groundwater, farm worker safety and food safety.''
   Laura Rhodes of Capitol Hill-based Public Citizen said the group
was ``pleased that Congress has at long last begun reforming this
country's ineffective pesticide laws, but we are hungry to see
Congress tackle food safety, groundwater and farm worker safety
provisions next session.''
   ``The bill isn't perfect but it's a necessary first step to a
rational pesticide policy,'' said Janet S. Hathaway, project
attorney of the Natural Resources Defense Council. The group took
actress Meryl Streep on a tour of Capitol Hill offices to drum up
support for the measure.
   Leahy echoed a concern of many environmentalists that EPA has
dragged its feet because it was unwilling to spend the money for
intensified safety efforts. Shifting the burden in large part to
the industry should alleviate some of that fear, he said.

<HEAD>Budget Director To Quit Next Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget Director James C. Miller III is leaving
his job effective Oct. 15 to work for a private research group and
George Mason University.
   President Reagan announced the resignation Wednesday and said
Miller would be replaced by Joseph R. Wright Jr., who has been
deputy budget director since 1982.
   Miller will become a fellow of the Center for Study of Public
Choice at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., a Washington
suburb. He also will become a fellow of Citizens for a Sound
Economy, an advocacy and research organization in Washington
favoring lower taxes, fiscal restraint and free trade.
   Peggy Murray, director of public relations for the group, said
Miller would divide his time about equally between the two
organizations.
   Miller has been director of the Office of Management and Budget,
the agency that writes the president's budgets, since Oct. 8, 1985.
Before that he was chairman of the Federal Trade Commission for
four years.
   Wright joined OMB six years ago after serving for one year in
the Commerce Department.
   Deputy White House Press Secretary B. Jay Miller said Wright
would become acting director on Miller's departure. He said the
president's announcement did not constitute an official nomination
``at this time.'' The post of director requires confirmation by the
Senate.
   Reagan said that at the FTC Miller ``played a leading role in
removing the shackles of excessive regulation from our economy.''
   At OMB, he said, Miller ``has been at the center of our battle
to bring the deficit down. And it's been coming down almost from
the day he took over.''
   Miller has been a low-key budget director in sharp contrast to
the combative and colorful David Stockman, whom he succeeded.

<HEAD>Many Younger Teachers Looking for New Careers, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More young teachers are planning to change
careers, despite an increase in job satisfaction in the profession
as a whole, according to a national survey released today.
   The 1988 Survey of the American Teacher found that 34 percent of
teachers with less than five years experience said they planned to
leave teaching, up from 19 percent in 1985.
   Planned defections from teaching were especially common among
black and Hispanic teachers, the survey said. Forty-one percent of
all minority group teachers polled said they were likely to leave
teaching in the next five years, compared with only 25 percent of
all non-minority teachers.
   The planned defections among younger teachers came despite an
overall increase in job satisfaction among teachers, the survey
reported. Fifty percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied
overall with their jobs, up from 40 percent in 1985.
   The survey also found that the proportion of those earning more
than $30,000 doubled since 1985, rising from 13 percent to 26
percent.
   The survey was sponsored by Metropolitan Life and conducted
between April and June of this year by Louis Harris & Associates.
The company questioned 1,208 teachers and 2,700 public school
students in grades four through 12.
   Results in most cases had margins of error between 2 and 3
percentage points.
   Most of the teachers surveyed described their relationship with
students as ``cooperative'' and ``respectful.'' Seventy-one percent
characterized the relationship as cooperative and 68 percent said
it was respectful.
   Similarly, 70 percent of all students polled characterized
student-teacher relationships in their schools as either ``good''
or ``excellent.''
   Still, the survey indicated that most students are either
ambivalent about school, 33 percent, or say they don't enjoy it, 23
percent.

<HEAD>Meeting May Herald Key Changes In Soviet Political System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders gather Friday for a hastily
called meeting on the country's political future, expected to
discuss lifting party control on day-to-day management of the
economy and allowing multiple-candidate elections.
   The plenary session of the 300-member Central Committee will
discuss changes key to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's goal of
promoting efficiency in government by making the 20 million-member
Communist Party focus on ideology and policy goals.
   The Central Committee session, announced Wednesday, had been
planned for a long time but the specific date had not been set.
   ``The plenary will be devoted to reorganization of the party
apparatus, including the Central Committee itself,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United
Nations in New York, where Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
was attending the General Assembly session.
   When the announcement was made, Shevardnadze and other Soviet
officials rushed back home from trips abroad.
   ``There will be changes in the working of our political
structure,'' Gerasimov said.
   One of the key political reforms involves the strengthening of
the office of president of the Soviet Union, a government post.
Gorbachev has said the largely figurehead position should be
expanded to include primary responsibility for defense and foreign
affairs.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev said nothing short of a wholesale
overhaul of the political system will do.
   ``Any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity
of radical change. It is needed in the party, in the state, in
agriculture, in industry, in personnel policy and most of all in
people's mentality, in their attitudes to work, to one another and
to themselves,'' Gorbachev said at a Kremlin dinner honoring
visiting East German leader Erich Honecker.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, carried the only Soviet
media report about the Central Committee plenum. It quoted
Gerasimov's announcement at the United Nations.
   Two Soviet sources in Moscow dismissed speculation of an
emergency or that the meeting concerned the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan. They spoke to reporters at a reception at the U.S.
Ambassador's residence.
   ``There is no crisis,'' said one highly placed source in Moscow.
   Shevardnadze, a member of the 13-man Politburo, would attend any
meeting of the Central Committee. All committee members who are
abroad, including a number of ambassadors, were summoned, Gerasimov
said.
   Valentin Falin, head of the government press agency Novosti,
told a reporter at the ambassador's reception that Communist
leaders would meet Friday to discuss political reforms mapped out
at the 19th party conference in Moscow June 28-July 2. He declined
to specify the topic.
   On July 29, the Central Committee adopted a timetable for
overhauling the Soviet political system. The first deadline set was
October, by which time the Central Committee said a draft law on
amendments to the Soviet Constitution and on multi-candidate
elections of legislators was to be completed.
   The Central Committee is empowered to make personnel changes in
the Politburo. At the 19th party conference, one delegate suggested
that holdovers from the 18-year tenure of Soviet president Leonid
I. Brezhnev be eased out of the leadership. The delegate
specifically named President Andrei A. Gromyko, 79, and fellow
Politburo member Mikhail S. Solomentsev, 76, as leaders who should
retire.
   Since the conference, Gromyko has continued meeting visiting
foreign statemen, and is scheduled to visit North Korea during the
first 10 days of October.
   The Brezhnev era is now widely condemned for allowing rampant
corruption and decay of the Soviet economy and making mistakes in
foreign policy.

<HEAD>Third Conviction `Only The Beginning,' Says DEA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conviction of three Mexican nationals in
a U.S. drug agent's murder in Mexico is being hailed by federal law
enforcement officials as ``only the beginning'' toward bringing all
the killers to justice.
   ``Our goal is to see that everyone who participated in the
torture and kidnapping and murder of agent Enrique Camarena is
brought to justice,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner told reporters
after Wednesday's verdict against the third of three co-defendants.
   In Washington, John C. Lawn, chief of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said he will press ``the crusade for justice'' in
Camarena's killing, which authorities allege was masterminded by
reputed Mexican drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero.
   The eight-week trial included evidence that Mexican police took
bribes to protect drug smugglers, and the case strained
U.S.-Mexican relations.
   A U.S. District Court jury that deliberated six days returned
its last verdict Wednesday, finding convicted drug trafficker Jesus
Felix Gutierrez, 38, guilty of aiding and abetting the 1985
torture-murders of Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Jurors concluded Felix helped Caro escape to Costa Rica after
the murders. Authorities allege that Caro wanted revenge for DEA
raids on his marijuana plantations.
   Earlier, the same jury convicted a homicide investigator in
Guadalajara, Mexico, Raul Lopez Alvarez, 28; and a drug trafficker,
Rene Verdugo Urquidez, 36, of participating in the kidnap-murders.
   ``This is only the beginning,'' said DEA spokesman John Zienter.
``We are well aware that there are other people involved in the
murder of Special Agent Enrique Camarena.''
   Bonner said he hoped other defendants in custody in Mexico,
including Caro, would be convicted. Should they be acquitted, he
said, the United States might move to extradite them.
   Caro, 37, has been convicted on weapons and narcotics charges,
but the Camarena murder charge is pending.
   Camarena was kidnapped from outside the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara on Feb. 7, 1985. The battered bodies of Camarena and
his pilot were found at a remote ranch on March 5, 1985.
   Jurors heard a dramatic audio tape of Camarena's last hours in
which he begged his captors to stop the torture.
   ``Don't hit me anymore!'' he pleaded.
   Felix's attorney told reporters he will appeal his client's
conviction.
   ``I asked a question before the trial _ could a Mexican drug
dealer receive a fair trial in this kind of case with these kind of
brutal facts in the United States? I think the answer is: It's
impossible,'' said attorney Barry Tarlow.
   Jurors were hurriedly escorted out of the courthouse by U.S.
marshals.
   The three men tried here had never met before they were brought
to court. Lopez, who was born in Mexico but grew up in Los Angeles,
returned to his native Guadalaljara where he became a member of the
homicide squad with the Jalisco state police. Jurors saw a secretly
recorded videotape of Lopez discussing details of Camarena's murder.
   Verdugo, described as Caro's chief lieutenant, was linked to the
murder scene by a strand of hair. Two government informants said
they heard him discuss the crime.
   Felix, who operated a seafood company in Los Angeles, was
implicated by government informants who said he spoke of arranging
Caro's escape to Costa Rica.
   Judge Edward Rafeedie said he would sentence Felix and Verdugo
on Oct. 26 and Lopez on Oct. 24.
   Bonner said he would seek the maximum sentences: life
imprisonment for Lopez and Verdugo, 10 years for Felix.
   Nine men were indicted in Los Angeles in the murders but only
three were tried here. One was subsequently killed in a shootout.
Four, including Caro, were tried in Mexico.
   Caro and Ernesto Fonseca Carillo, 63, were sentenced on weapons
and narcotics convictions last week. Caro was sentenced to 34 years
and Fonseca 11 years. Bonner said verdicts on the murder charges in
Mexico are not expected until January.

<TEXT>
   Relations between China and the Soviet Union,
strained by nearly three decades of ill will, took a major step
toward normalization with the announcement that China's foreign
minister will visit Moscow this year.
   Qian Qichen's visit is expected to advance talks on ending
Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, the most serious issue dividing
the two Communist powers, and set the stage for the first
Sino-Soviet summit since 1959.
   The trip was announced Wednesday at United Nations headquarters
in New York following a meeting between Qian and his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Qian
``agreed to come to Moscow at the end of this year, where the
negotiations will be continued on the Kampuchean (Cambodian)
question and bilateral questions.''
   He said Qian will meet Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
that Shevardnadze would visit Beijing at a later date.
   Chinese radio and the official press today mentioned Qian's
proposed visit to Moscow in reports on his meeting with
Shevardnadze, but did not give prominent play to the announcement.
   China's leading daily, the People's Daily, noted plans for the
trip in the second paragraph of a story carried on page six, its
international news page.
   China and the Soviet Union split over ideological and strategic
differences around 1960, with hostilities increasing until the two
sides fought a brief border war in 1969.
   Political normalization talks, accompanied by increased trade
and other unofficial contacts, began in 1982, but China has refused
to fully restore normal relations until ``three obstacles'' are
removed.
   Two of those obstacles have been lowered with the Soviet Union
beginning its withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and the
reduction of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border, but Soviet support
for Vietnam's military occupation of Cambodia remains a key point
of dispute.
   Last month, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev flew to
Beijing for the first Sino-Soviet talks on how to solve the
Cambodian question.
   Soviet officials in Beijing said the talks produced broad points
of agreement on Cambodia, with the timetable for Vietnam's
withdrawal being the major stumbling block. Vietnam says its
pullout will be complete by early 1990.
   The officials said they expected that further progress could be
made at the Qian-Shevardnadze talks in New York, paving the way for
improved ties.
   Soviet spokesman Gerasimov, asked if Qian's visit could lead to
a Sino-Soviet summit, replied, ``We hope so. We are ready for it.
We hope. We emphasize that everything in Soviet-Chinese relations
must be normalized. We are on the way.''
   China's Premier Li Peng, in an interview with The Associated
Press earlier this month, stressed that improved relations with the
Soviet Union were in the interests of China and of world peace.
   He also said that China will never return to the relationship of
the 1950s, when Moscow played big brother to the fledgling
Communist government in Beijing and that better Sino-Soviet ties
will not affect China's good relations with the United States.
   Chinese and Soviet vice foreign ministers have exchanged visits
repeatedly in the last few years for talks on Chinese-Soviet border
issues. Qian went to Moscow several times in that capacity. He
became foreign minister in April.
   The forthcoming visit of the 60-year-old Qian, a Russian speaker
who has been posted in Moscow, marks the first working visit of a
Chinese foreign minister in at least 20 years.
   Former Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua went to Moscow in 1982
to attend the funeral of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, but it was
not a working visit.
   The last Soviet foreign minister to visit China was Andrei
Gromyko, now Soviet president, who went there in 1959. In that
year, then-Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev came to the United
Nations and denounced China.

<TEXT>
   Eighty lucky ninth-graders in Florida got front-row seats for
today's launch of Discovery, but some pupils weren't allowed to
watch the live television coverage to spare them possible trauma in
the event something went wrong.
   In Concord, N.H., the home of Challenger teacher-astronaut
Christa McAuliffe, nothing special was planned. And plans for a
nationwide educational project built around America's return to
manned spaceflight fell through.
   Millions of schoolchildren were watching when the last shuttle
lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986, because of McAuliffe, who was to give
lessons from space.
   When Challenger blew up 73 seconds after launch, killing the
seven astronauts aboard, students gathered in a festive assembly at
McAuliffe's Concord High School were watching on live television.
   This time, no organized school events were scheduled in Concord.
   ``Perhaps our relationship to Christa will mean more classrooms
will watch it, but I don't think it's going to be a big deal,''
schools Superintendent Mark Beauvais said Wednesday. ``We certainly
aren't going to push it to make it one.''
   Concord High banned reporters from the school's buildings and
grounds.
   At Kimball Elementary School, where McAuliffe's son, Scott, is
in the sixth grade and daughter, Caroline, is in the third,
Principal Clint Cogswell said he expected some classes would watch
the launch _ but not Scott's or Caroline's.
   The Discovery mission excited teachers and students in Willmar,
Minn., where crew member George ``Pinky'' Nelson grew up.
   ``It's kind of a local hero thing,'' said Jim Christenson,
director of elementary education in the city of 16,000. ``With the
launch, all the TV coverage and the balloons, and some kids are
making colored prints of the launch site which will be on exhibit
... they are getting excited.''
   Tumbleweed Elementary School in Palmdale, Calif., planned to
celebrate the launch by firing model rockets into space, science
teacher Gary Whiddison said. The students, some with parents who
worked on the shuttle, have been studying rocket designs.
   The desert community of Palmdale is south of Edwards Air Force
Base, where the shuttle is to land.
   Geraldine Haracz, a fourth-grade teacher at Edwards Elementary
School in Chicago, wore a space suit and explained mission control
to students watching the Challenger launch. She planned the same
for today.
   ``I think we have helped them understand that this was one
moment of tragedy that will help us go on'' and learn more about
space, said Miss Haracz.
   In Greenwich, Conn., Julian Curtiss School Principal Linda
Hartzer said she planned to videotape the launch and show it to her
elementary school pupils if it succeeds.
   ``Obviously, if it was a deadly experience, we would handle it a
different way,'' she said. Hartzer said a school team of
psychologists, educators, counselors and social workers would
decide what to do in that case.
   The Challenger Center, which was formed by the Challenger
astronauts' families to promote space education, had hoped to
distribute free ``Countdown 5-4-3-2-1'' kits to the nation's 65,000
elementary schools before Discovery's launch, said spokesman
Richard Hutto. But the kits won't be ready to be mailed until late
next week, said Liz Thomas, an administrative assistant for the
Challenger Center's education department in Washington.
   However, all is not lost, Hutto said. ``There were some specific
things about this launch, but the kits are designed to be
generic,'' he said. ``It's written in such a way it could be used
on future flights.''
   For today's flight, 80 students from Lincoln Park Academy in
Fort Pierce, Fla., had a clear view of the launch from the parking
lot of a McDonald's restaurant in Titusville three miles from the
pad.
   Restaurant manager Mike Reed said the students got exclusive
rights to the parking lot, beating out news organizations, because
they asked first.

<HEAD>Riot Police Beat Demonstrators in Lithuania</HEAD>

   A newly formed paramilitary unit joined police in
violently crushing a demonstration by tens of thousands of
Lithuanians against Soviet control of their Baltic republic, a
witness said.
   Up to 40 demonstrators, some bloodied from beatings by
truncheon-wielding police, were arrested during the rally in the
capital's republic, Vilnius, said Valdas Analauskas, correspondent
for the unofficial journal Express Chronicle.
   He said some demonstrators fought back by throwing stones during
the four-hour protest on Wednesday.
   The officers surrounded Gediminas Square at 5 p.m., when the
protest was to begin. They pushed and shoved some of the hordes of
people gathered there, he said in a telephone interview.
   Many protesters moved to a nearby park, but when 60-year-old
former political prisoner Antanas Terleckas began to speak through
a megaphone, police moved in and beat demonstrators with rubber
truncheons, Analauskas said.
   He said the protesters shouted, ``Occupiers, get out of here!''
   Paramilitary police, recently formed nationwide to keep order at
demonstrations and control, joined local police in cracking down on
the demonstration, Analauskas said.
   He said they charged four times to disperse the gathering.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said hundreds of people
tried to hold a meeting, but police prevented it from being held.
Tass said about 20 people were arrested in Vilnius for hooliganism
and disobeying police orders.
   The demonstration was called to press Soviet authorities to
publish the secret 1939 non-aggression pact signed by the Soviet
Union and Nazi Germany under which the two powers divided Eastern
Europe, assigning the Baltic republcs of Lithuania, Estonia and
Latvia to the Soviet sphere of influence.
   Lithuanian nationalists also want greater autonomy for their
republic.

   The United States is disturbed by Israel's use
of plastic bullets against Palestinian demonstrators, contending
the policy is leading to rising casualties in the occupied
territories.
   According to published reports, at least three Palestinians have
been killed and 70 wounded since the Israeli Army began using
plastic bullets a month ago. The bullets have been described by
their defenders as non-lethal.
   ``We believe that measures must be taken to reduce rather than
to increase casualties among Palestinian demonstrators,'' State
Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said on Wednesday.
   ``Thus we are disturbed by the rising casualties of Palestinians
in recent clashes with the Israeli military. We can see no
justification for a policy admittedly designed to cause an increase

hurricane.
   Roofing materials, medical supplies, seeds and farming tools
also will be purchased.
   On Sept. 12, Hurricane Gilbert wrecked tens of thousands of

<HEAD>Company Drops Claims After Media Inquiries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance company that demanded more than
$19,000 from a janitor and his mentally retarded wife because of
fire damage caused by their 6-year-old daughter dropped the claim
after reporters inquired about it.
   Suzanne and Gordon Dean agonized for nearly a month over how
they would repay Fireman's Fund Insurance Cos. for damages caused
to their former apartment by the March blaze.
   Fireman's Fund, which insured the building, told the Deans they
could pay $50 a month for the next 32 years to repay the $19,616 it
paid for repairs to the family's apartment.
   But with the $630 Gordon brought home a month from his
janitorial job, ``We can't pay them,'' said Mrs. Dean, 35. ``Right
now we'd be taking food out of our mouths.''
   On Tuesday, the Deans learned they wouldn't have to pay.
Fireman's Fund dropped all claims against the family after the
media inquiries.
   Fireman's Fund, which has its headquarters near San Francisco
and last year had revenues of $3.9 billion, is dropping its case
against the Deans because ``this is the right thing to do,'' said
John Kozero, a spokesman for the insurance company. ``This case is
special.''
   ``This is a nightmare when this sort of thing happens,'' said
Kozero, who only recently learned of the case. ``You wonder how
things happened to get to this point.''
   Others have wondered, too. Susan Butler, a Los Angeles lawyer
and a friend of Suzanne Dean's mother, waged a telephone war,
calling Fireman's Fund executives and alerting Dallas reporters.
   Lee Jones, spokesman for the State Board of Insurance, said the
company had ``no right'' to demand anything from the Deans without
a court order. ``We're pleased that Fireman's Fund made a decision
that results in a happy ending to a situation that must have been
tremendously distressing to this family,'' he said.
   Kozero said Fireman's Fund employees who handled the claim
against the Deans were not fully aware of the family's problems,
which included the loss of all their possessions in the fire.
   But Ms. Butler said she told at least two company employees last
week that Mrs. Dean was mentally retarded and that the family was
in dire financial condition.
   ``This has just made my day,'' said Dean, 36. ``I'm relieved. If
I'd had to pay them for 32 years, I'd be 68 years old when I was
finished.''

<HEAD>Opposition: Military Sowing Climate Of Fear Before Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDUARDO GALLARDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of groups opposed to
right-wing President Augusto Pinochet has accused the military of
sowing a climate of fear as an excuse to call off or annul a
referendum on his rule.
   The government did not immediately issue a statement reacting to
the charge about the balloting, scheduled for next Wednesday.
   Chileans will vote either ``yes'' or ``no'' on whether to give
Pinochet a new eight-year term as president.
   A 16-party anti-government coalition said Wednesday it was
concerned with government advertisements predicting political
violence and social chaos if the ``no'' vote wins.
   Coalition leader Patricio Aylwin said the coalition is worried
``the government or ultra-rightist groups will ... try to alter the
course of the campaign, carrying out last-minute acts of violence
to create a pretext for avoiding the plebiscite.''
   In the southern city of Concepcion, meanwhile, street protests
broke out when the president campaigned there. No injuries or
arrested were reported.
   The opposition also said it was confident that should the vote
take place the people would reject Pinochet.
   Gen. Pinochet and other top officials repeatedly have said they
plan to abide by the 1980 consitution, which calls for the
referendum as part of a phased transition to elected rule.
   Pinochet, 72, the army commander, seized power in a 1973
military coup that toppled elected President Salvador Allende, a
Marxist.
   If a majority votes ``yes'' in the referendum, Pinochet will
assume a new eight-year term next March. If Pinochet loses, an open
election is to be held next year and Pinochet would hand power over
to the winner in 1990.
   Most polls give the opposition a substantial lead over Pinochet
in the referendum.
   But in an apparent last-minute effort to sway voters, new
government television commercials include images of burned
children, bodies in the street and hordes of people attacking
innocent women and children.
   The government's message is that social chaos will occur if the
opposition wins.
   ``We call attention to the possibility that the day of the
plebiscite, and facing the imminence of its defeat, the government
will try to create a situation that makes the vote invalid,'' said
the statement read by Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian
Democratic Party, at a news conference.
   On Tuesday, the navy commander, Adm. Jose Merino, warned Chilean
leftists that ``they are going to hurt a lot'' if they take to the
streets the night of the referendum, which he described as a battle
between God and Satan.
   The government maintains that an opposition victory in the
referendum would mean communist rule, despite the fact that many
moderate groups oppose Pinochet.

<HEAD>Japanese Worry About Decorum for Emperor's Illness
^With PM-Hirohito</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Etiquette-conscious Japanese are unnerved over what
to say, how to act, and even what to drink in the face of their
emperor's illness.
   Their unease has produced everything from a forgivable slip of
the tongue in a prime minister to a jaw-lowering newspaper
editorial expressing grief over Emperor Hirohito's death.
   With the many social changes in the 62 years of Hirohito's
reign, the Japanese just don't seem to know how to deal properly
with his illness _ much less his eventual death.
   The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's second-largest newspaper, said Nissan
Motor Corp. had canceled a television commercial with the catch
phrase ``Is everybody in good spirits?'' while a Tokyo car
dealership had taken down posters extolling ``The Joy of Living.''
   For high-ranking politicians, overseas sojourns have been
canceled or postponed and even trips away from Tokyo have been
avoided.
   Television stations have toned down boisterous programming,
marriage ceremonies have been put off and sales put on hold at
department stores.
   However, Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi told reporters today
that the emperor would be disappointed at a rash of cancellations
of sports events and autumn festivals.
   ``I think the people's consideration for the emperor's early
recovery is so precious,'' Obuchi said. ``But it's not favorable if
it has a negative effect on social and economic activities. It
would disappoint the emperor, who always considers the people.''
   The 87-year-old emperor took to bed Sept. 19 after he vomited
blood from intestinal hemorrhaging.
   At first, domestic news media confined themselves mainly to
reporting the details of his medical condition. However, reports
have now begun to percolate through the taut silence that the
emperor, the longest-reigning monarch alive, may have cancer _
itself a taboo subject in Japan.
   News organizations have tried to walk a tightrope, demonstrating
proper deference to the ailing monarch but saying enough to show
their concern.
   Even leaders schooled in public life have faltered in the
confusion.
   During a meeting with reporters following his first trip to the
Imperial Palace since the emperor fell ill, Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita was clearly unnerved, one news report said.
   In response to a reporter's question, Takeshita committed the
social gaffe of using honorifics in reference to himself, the
weekly Shukan Asahi magazine reported.
   Honorifics, part of the Japanese vocabulary used when speaking
or referring to people of higher status, have been prominent in
newspaper headlines describing the emperor's condition.
   Though forgivable, the breach of etiquette underscored
Takeshita's _ and the nation's _ discomfort over the emperor's
condition.
   On Monday, the English-language Mainichi Daily News accidentally
published an editorial expressing grief over the emperor's death.
The scandalous mistake ended in dismissal of the paper's general
manager and demotion of the editor in chief of the whole Mainichi
group of publications.
   Some embarrassments have been avoided. In keeping with the
restrained national mood, no alcohol was served at a fund-raising
party Wednesday night for a junior member of parliament, the
mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported today.
   The Japanese have also toiled _ and puzzled _ over contingency
plans for the emperor's death. A news report even quoted a manager
of one restaurant franchise as saying tiny Japanese flags used as
decorations for children's lunches would be removed.
   ``They would be removed because they are flags that can't be
flown at half-staff,'' the manager reportedly said.
   A nationwide association of outdoor advertisers, including
businesses which produce or regulate the use of neon signs,
recently held an emergency meeting to set guidelines, according to
the weekly magazine Aera.
   They decided that when the emperor dies, all large neon signs
should be turned off until the fourth night afterward.
   ``It would be terrible if only your shop would stand out,'' said
one industry source quoted by the nationally circulated
newsmagazine.
   Not everyone, however, has fretted over doing the wrong thing.
   The Akahata newspaper of the Japan Communist Party criticized
the subdued national mood by publishing comments from readers
angered by changes in television schedules.
   ``I was really mad,'' a 27-year-old housewife was quoted as
telling the newspaper. ``My 6- and 7-year-old children started
crying in front of the TV set after waiting for a cartoon show to
begin.''

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Thursday, while share prices lost ground on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 134.35 yen, up 0.15 yen from Wednesday's
finish. It ranged mainly between 133.85 yen and 134.50 yen after
opening the day at 133.98 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 252.45-point
winner Wednesday, lost 51.88 points, or 0.17 percent, to finish at
27,700.13 points.
   A report that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze had
left a United Nations meeting for the Soviet Union sharply
increased the dollar-buying drive, said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said investors who speculated the departure could indicate
the administration of Mikhail Gorbachev might be getting weaker
started selling the yen to buy more dollars, helping to push the
U.S. currency higher.
   The report alleging a secret meeting in the Soviet Union also
affected the stock market, said an analyst with Nomura Securities,
Japan's largest brokerage.
   ``Although the market has been doing well for the last couple of
days, such news immediately made investors cautious and affected
their trading,'' said the Nomura analyst, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He also said profit-taking was contributing to the Nikkei's fall.

<HEAD>Discovery's Primary Task To Deploy $100 Million Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $100 million satellite to be
deployed today from shuttle Discovery will nearly double the time
ground controllers can talk to astronauts as they orbit Earth.
   Aside from proving shuttles can fly again, deploying the
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite is Discovery's main mission. One
is already in orbit, but a nearly identical one was destroyed in
the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986.
   The satellite, once it reaches it final orbit of 22,300 miles,
will help ground controllers monitor shuttles and unmanned
spacecraft. Coverage provided by the satellite is more continuous
than the space agency's worldwide network of ground-based
communications tracking systems.
   Deploying the satellite is important to NASA because the one in
orbit has had minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percent
capacity, said Jim Elliott, a spokesman at the agency's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. That satellite can monitor
shuttles about 45 percent of each orbit.
   A satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft or
another satellite and a ground terminal at White Sands Missile
Range, N.M., which then routes it to the appropriate NASA facility.
   The deployment is scheduled to begin about six hours after
liftoff, although there were five later times it could be done if
needed.
   A spring-loaded ejection device first pushes the satellite and
an Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket from Discovery's cargo bay,
and the satellite waltzes away at 2.7 mph.
   About an hour later, the rocket's first stage fires. The second
stage ignites 12{ hours after launch and puts the satellite in its
final orbit.
   The satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about
45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard
a shuttle, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials
said. The satellite itself weighs about 5,000 pounds and it has two
50-pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas.
   The satellite will be placed in orbit over the Pacific Ocean
near the Gilbert Islands. Its orbit keeps it always hovering over
the same part of the Earth.
   On Tuesday, NASA had a brief scare when a booster rocket being
readied for a shuttle flight next February was found to have a
damaged seal.
   There was concern that the booster rocket aboard Discovery might
have the same flaw, but engineers worked overnight and determined
from tests that even with such a defect, the seal would perform
properly.

   Florence Griffith Joyner twice smashed
a world record Thursday as she blazed to a gold medal in the
200-meter sprint.
   She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win four
track and field gold medals in a single Olympics.
   Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds,
shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier in
her semifinal heat. In that race, she ran 21.56, eclipsing the
9-year-old mark of 21.71 set in 1979 by Marita Koch of East Germany
and equaled three times since.
   In her 200 quarterfinal heat Wednesday, Griffith Joyner ran an
Olympic record 21.76 seconds.
   Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the
100 meters, had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for the
final 100 meters. She glided to the wire.
   ``I know I can run much faster,'' she said. ``I felt very
relaxed. That's the key.''
   Griffith Joyner, 28, is scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay
Saturday and may compete in the 1,600-meter relay that day.
   Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorful
bodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the
1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. sprinter and long
jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in
1948.

<TEXT>
   Republican Dan Quayle was turning to debate
preparations today after a campaign swing intended to end doubts
about how much support he had from George Bush.
   From the moment Bush gave Quayle words of praise and a
reassuring fatherly pat at a Jackson, Tenn., rally on Monday, the
process of establishing Quayle's campaign credentials was under way.
   The 41-year-old Indiana senator debates his Democratic
counterpart and Senate colleague, Lloyd Bentsen, Wednesday in
Omaha, Neb.
   Top Bush strategists stalked reporters on Quayle's campaign
plane as the Indiana senator made his first foray into Texas, the
state where Bentsen was born and Bush had made his home.
   Their message: Quayle has Bush's confidence despite
controversies over his past military service, academic record and
personal life, not to mention polls showing many voters have doubts
about his qualifications. They claimed Quayle is doing all a vice
presidential candidate could to help out the ticket.
   Rich Bond, Bush's deputy campaign manager and political
director, said that with the completion Wednesday of Quayle's Texas
swing, Quayle has campaigned in 35 states, nine of them targeted by
the campaign as important swing states.
   Quayle's role has been to campaign in safe Republican areas,
hold the party's base for November and get good local media
coverage.
   ``Remember the perspective of what a vice presidential nominee
traditionally does _ hold your base and help out target states,''
Bond said.
   In the Texas cities Quayle visited this week, he got front-page
headlines and often color photographs.
   Although there have been reports that Bush has tried to distance
himself from Quayle because of the negative publicity surrounding
him, aides said that was not a factor in Monday's joint appearance
being the ticket's first since Aug. 20.
   ``Presidential and vice presidential candidates don't spend a
lot of time together on the road,'' Bond said. ``That is no
reflection on Dan Quayle's standing with us.''
   Quayle's mission in Texas, with its 29 electoral votes, was to
raise money and go after Dukakis. Bentsen was largely ignored. In
fact, Quayle never mentioned him publicly by name.
   Quayle continued the GOP strategy of portraying Dukakis as an
unrepentant liberal, out of touch with mainstream views.
   On Tuesday, he called on Dukakis to resign his membership in the
American Civil Liberties Union. On Wednesday, he blasted Dukakis
for being on the advisory board of a group which advocated deep
defense cuts and which has among its supporters ``the extreme left
wing of the Democratic Party.'' The highly partisan crowds jeered.

   Saying ``I am not a liar and I am not
crazy,'' a black teen-ager who claims she was abducted and raped by
whites rejected the reported conclusion of a grand jury that she
fabricated her harrowing tale.
   ``I have not deceived my advisers, my family and most of all, my
people,'' Tawana Brawley said at a news conference Wednesday in her
first public comment on the case, which sparked allegations of a
racially motivated cover-up.
   After she read her statement, Miss Brawley, 16, declined to
answer questions about November's incident.
   ``I am not a liar and I am not crazy. I just want justice and I
then want to be left alone,'' said Miss Brawley, who recently moved
with her mother and her mother's boyfriend from Wappingers Falls,
N.Y., to Virginia Beach, Va.
   Poised as she gave the five-minute statement, her voice only
began to quaver toward the end.
   ``I will give full testimony to an impartial grand jury _ an
impartial grand jury _ or a congressional committee,'' said Miss
Brawley, who so far has refused to testify.
   ``I wish to thank God for saving my life,'' she said of the
incident. ``He holds my hand and He let me live to stop the
cover-up once and for all.''
   Earlier Wednesday, her advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton and
lawyers Alton Maddox and C. Vernon Mason _ asserted that New York
state Attorney General Robert Abrams and New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
had illegally leaked the grand jury findings to The New York Times,
which published the panel's conclusions Tuesday.
   During an interview on WLIB, a black-oriented radio station in
New York City, Sharpton said the three black activists would lead a
protest in Brooklyn this afternoon to ``make the whole city stand
still.''
   At the news conference, Sharpton challenged the grand jury and
the Times to ``give us one name of one witness that can establish
that this was a hoax.''
   Mason challenged Abrams and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of
New York to ``debate the racist system.''
   In a statement, Giuliani said: ``These people have proven by
their irresponsible words and actions that they cannot be taken
seriously. It would be inappropriate to dignify anything they say
with a response.''
   Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for the attorney general, said,
``Abrams did not leak the grand jury materials to the Times and he
has asked the state's special corruption prosecutor, Joe Hynes, to
investigate who did.''
   Gilles said he could not comment on when the panel's report
would be released.
   Miss Brawley's mother, Glenda, and boyfriend Ralph King were at
the news conference but did not speak.
   Had she returned to New York, Mrs. Brawley faced 30 days in jail
for defying a subpoena to testify in the grand jury investigation
of her daughter's claims.
   According to the Times, the grand jury speculated that Miss
Brawley fabricated the tale because she feared King would punish
her for staying out late, and that drugs and her relationships with
shady characters may have played a role.
   The grand jury, which has been directed by Abrams, the special
prosecutor in the case, will issue no indictments, the Times
reported. The panel is not permitted to criticize ordinary citizens
it does not indict.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28 inside a garbage bag near an
apartment her family once occupied in Wappingers Falls. She was
smeared with dog feces, seemingly dazed and with racial slurs
scrawled on her body.
   Evidence led the grand jury to conclude she was not abducted
Nov. 24 as she claimed, but stayed at least part of the time in the
vacant apartment.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Shares Down in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today, and share prices closed lower on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar finished at 134.35 yen, up 0.15 yen from Wednesday's
close of 134.20 yen. After opening lower at 133.98 yen, the
currency rose and traded between 133.85 yen and 134.50 yen.
   The dollar-buying trend in Tokyo began after dealers heard that
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze left a U.N. meeting in
New York late Wednesday for a secret session in the Soviet Union,
said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said investors who speculated the departure could indicate a
weakening of the administration of Mikhail Gorbachev started
selling yens to buy more dollars, helping to push the U.S. currency
higher.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, an official with Daiwa Bank, also said the
news affected the currency exchange.
   ``Investors began thinking something must be happening in the
Soviet politics, which boosted dollar-buying,'' he said.
``Participants' cautiousness made the dollar-yen rate fluctuate
afterwards, though.''
   The dollar later traded mainly in the lower 134-yen level, he
said.
   Meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues ended
trading at 27,700.13, down 51.88 points, or 0.19 percent, from the
previous day's close of 27,752.01. Following Wednesday's
252.45-point gain, the Nikkei rose another 57.07 points shortly
after the market opened but then declined.
   Investors became cautious and remained on the sidelines after
the news about Shevarnadze, a Nomura Securities analyst said.
   ``In addition, after the hectic trading for the last two days,
some investors sold high-priced issues for their profit,'' he said.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billion
shares with steel and shipbuilding stocks falling in value.

<HEAD>`Paul Robeson,' Starring Avery Brooks, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 2 grafs with other review; No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of Paul Robeson may be too large, too
full of life to fit comfortably on stage but playwright Phillip
Hayes Dean shoehorns most of the biographical facts into his drama
about the famous black athlete, actor, singer and political
activist.
   Dean supplies the facts, and actor Avery Brooks, best known as
Hawk on TV's ``Spenser: For Hire,'' supplies the spirit for ``Paul
Robeson,'' which opened Wednesday at Broadway's Golden Theater.
   Brooks is an impressive performer, a fine singer as well as a
compelling actor. He needs both skills for this marathon portrait
that has him on stage for more than 2{ hours.
   Robeson's life is told simply and straightforwardly by the actor
himself. Dean sets out the story as if he were presenting a resume.
Fortunately, there are enough interesting events, even in Robeson's
early life, to make it palatable.
   The play details the college career at Rutgers University where,
in addition to being named Phi Beta Kappa, Robeson was a member of
the glee club, debating team and an extraordinary football player.
He ended up being named an All-American in 1917 and 1918.
   It follows Robeson to Columbia University where he got a law
degree and to Wall Street where, at the urging of his wife,
Eslanda, he had a brief, unhappy career as a lawyer. It traces his
theatrical career from a YMCA amateur outing where Eugene O'Neill
happened to be in the audience to his London triumph, singing ``Ol'
Man River'' in ``Show Boat.''
   The play is at its best when it has Robeson explaining how he
had to fight the system to survive. Whether trying to join the glee
club or playing football or struggling with a racist judicial
system, Robeson exuded a confidence and exuberance that radiates
across the footlights.
   Brooks captures that exuberance in such a way that these
personal struggles become moving mini-dramas sprinkled throughout
the evening. The portrait blurs as Robeson becomes more political,
trying to explain his backing for various causes, from the Loyalist
soldiers during the Spanish Civil War to the communist workers in
the Soviet Union. The earnestness of the message clouds some of the
drama.
   It's tempting to call ``Paul Robeson'' a one-man show, but it
isn't. Brooks gets more than able assistance from Ernie Scott, who
plays the piano and provides musical interludes that spell the lead
actor from time to time. Scott also plays several characters in the
show, including an inquisitor from the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
   But the play rests on Brooks, and the actor has enough stamina
and style to carry off the evening. He manages to be convincing,
making you believe in the man behind the mountain of facts and
swirl of events that Dean has put up on stage.
   In another review:
   Jerry Tallmer of the New York Post said: ``You would hardly know
that this Avery Brooks, this fellow who uses every conceivable stop
and soft and strong pedal on his own personal organ to put himself
under Robeson's skin, is the taciturn Hawk of TV's `Spenser for
Hire.' He is perhaps less grave, of less inner stature, than I
think Robeson was, with more of a sense of humor. But the final
words of the evening _ Othello's words, and Robeson's _ go for
Brooks too: `I have done the State some service, and they know't.'

   A boat evacuating residents from a
flooded village in the northern state of Punjab capsized today, and
all 25 people on board were missing, an army spokesman said.
   The boat overturned in strong currents near the village of
Talwandi Butain, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   The government says at least 282 people have died in flash
floods that have hit villages in Punjab and the neighboring states
of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu-Kashmir since Sept. 21.
   Indian newspapers put the death toll at 350.
   Hundreds of people remained marooned in villages and towns in
the central state of Punjab. The government feared the stagnant
muddy water could cause outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera.
   At least 1,500 villages in Punjab were under water. At least
70,000 people have been evacuated from the villages in boats and
helicopters, officials have said.

   A moderately strong earthquake hit the Tokyo region
today, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
   The quake struck at 5:17 p.m., registering 5.1 on the open-ended
Richter scale, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   The temblor occurred about 6 miles below southern Saitama, the
agency said.
   A National Police Agency official said no damage or casualties
had been reported.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area and 5 considerable damage. A 7 reading is
a ``major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a
``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Magnetic-Levitation Transport Should Run Along Interstates,
Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-speed magnetic-levitation transportation
systems whose cars would appear to float on air could be installed
along interstate highway routes, cutting pollution and saving
millions of barrels of oil a year, scientists say.
   ``Much of the system is very straight and contains adequate
space for both the existing highways and for vehicle guideways,
suitably isolated for mutual safety,'' Gordon Danby, a senior
physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory, told a congressional
panel Wednesday. ``This interstate approach overcomes the greatest
cost and availability impediment: obtaining guideway real estate.''
   ``Guideways'' are the magnetic tracks along which
magnetic-levitation cars run. The system works on the simple
principle that like magnetic poles repel each other. Cars glide
along, propelled by a traveling magnetic field.
   Danby and James R. Powell, a nuclear engineer at Brookhaven,
have agreed to head an advisory group that will study the
application of magnetic-levitation transportation to the interstate
highway system.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., chairman of the Environment
subcommittee on water resources, transportation and infrastructure,
said the advisory panel is slated to complete its work by February
1989 and that he will present its findings to the next president.
   Powell testified that if a ``mag-lev'' train running along the
Long Island Expressway carried 150,000 passengers a day, it could
save 8 million barrels of oil a year, while cutting air pollution
and saving wear on family cars.
   ``If mag-lev were to be applied on a nationwide basis, its total
benefits would be hundreds of times greater than sketched for the
Long Island application,'' he said.
   Danby also predicted that while mag-lev transport will not
replace the automobile or truck, it has a definite edge over
conventional trains.
   ``The mag-lev system is much faster and more energy-efficient,
providing potential for mobility much greater than previously
known,'' he said. ``Long trips in short time can become routine.''
   But Danby warned against buying existing mag-lev systems from
the Japanese and Germans, who quickly took to the American-invented
concept and made it reality.
   ``The existing mag-lev systems are first embodiments,'' he said.
``In the future, these will appear as dated as early automobiles or
airplanes.''
   He said the advisory panel will consider ways in which a U.S.
system could be financed.
   ``Options involving partnerships between public and private
sectors appear particularly interesting,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Using a technique to make millions of copies of
a tiny bit of genetic material, scientists have performed genetic
analysis on individual sperm and single body cells, says a report
published today.
   Sperm analysis should help the search for disease-causing genes,
while single-cell studies might allow diagnosis of genetic diseases
in an embryo soon after test-tube fertilization, researchers said.
   The early diagnosis would allow a decision on whether to implant
the embryo in the mother, researcher Norman Arnheim of the
University of Southern California in Los Angeles said Wednesday in
a telephone interview.
   Sperm analysis should also help police implicate or exclude rape
suspects, he said.
   Arnheim and graduate student Honghua Li report the work with
other scientists at the university and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville,
Calif., in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   They used a technique called polymerase chain reaction that
creates millions of copies of a minute amount of genetic material,
accumulating enough for genetic analysis.
   In one series of experiments, they were able to detect which of
two variants of a gene was present in 43 of 80 sperm analyzed. In
another series, they were able to identify variants in two genes
simultaneously in 70 of 114 sperm analyzed.
   Such analysis should help scientists find disease-causing genes,
Arnheim said.
   Genes lie along string-like structures called chromosomes. To
find particular genes, scientists use markers, which are bits of
genetic material at known locations along the same chromosome as
the gene they are seeking. They close in on the gene by discovering
closer and closer markers.
   When scientists have to determine the order in which markers lie
along a chromosome, they must study chromosomes from many members
of a family. But sperm from an individual can provide a far larger
number of appropriate chromosomes for analysis, letting scientists
find the order of very closely spaced markers, Arnheim said.

<TEXT>
   A former aide to Sen. Howard Metzenbaum has
been indicted on charges of accepting bribes from two Polish
immigrants, but the senator, who faces re-election in November,
questioned the indictment's timing.
   U.S. Attorney Patrick McLaughlin said Wednesday that Ladd
Anthony of Cleveland was indicted by a special federal grand jury
for agreeing to accept $2,000 from Waclaw Pietrzykowsky for helping
him get a friend admitted to the Ohio State University College of
Veterinary Medicine.
   The indictment also alleges Anthony accepted $300 to assist
Irena Boc obtain U.S. citizenship.
   ``Why did the Justice Department wait until six weeks before the
election (to indict)?'' asked Peter Harris, an administrative aide
to the Ohio Democrat.
   Metzenbaum, whose re-election is being challenged by Cleveland's
Republican mayor, George Voinovich, said he told the Justice
Department of the allegations against his aide almost two years ago.
   ``I asked the Justice Department to investiate Mr. Anthony 22
months ago in November of 1986, immediately after learning from a
constituent that Anthony might have acted improperly,'' Metzenbaum
said.
   ``The FBI informed me that they completed their investigation of
Mr. Anthony in November of 1987. Why has it taken the Justice
Department almost a year to seek the indictment is a question that
remains to be answered.''
   Marshall L. Sullivan, a spokesman for the Cleveland FBI office,
said the timing of the prosecution was up to the Criminal Division
of the Justice Department.
   ``The FBI expeditiously went about their investigation,''
Sullivan said. ``The U.S. Attorney's office and the Criminal
Division of the Justice Department _ it's their responsibility to
proceed when they decide.''
   A Justice Department spokesman could not be reached for comment
Wednesday night.
   Harris said he completed interviews with constituents on Nov.
20, 1986, that indicated Anthony may have accepted payments.
   ``A woman from Cleveland came in and told one of our case
workers that Anthony was one of a group of people who asked for
money. We found that two other people had similar stories,'' Harris
said.
   On July 19, 1987, the Justice Department reported the evidence
was credible enough to go to a grand jury and Anthony was fired,
Harris said.
   Elmer Giuliani, Anthony's attorney, said Wednesday he had not
received a copy of the indictment. ``I have to assume my client is
innocent,'' Giuliani said.
   Anthony is living in a Cleveland suburb but Giuliani declined to
give his address. The Cleveland telephone directory does not
contain a listing for him and he could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>Radical Students Battle Riot Police To Demand Leaders Release</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters yelling anti-Olympic
slogans hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police today as
radical students vowed to disrupt the Summer Games if a student
leader is not released.
   About 1,000 students clashed with police around Korea University
in the worst street clash in Seoul since the Games began Sept. 17.
   The protest marked the second straight day of demonstrations
calling for the release of student leader Oh Young-shik, arrested
by police last week.
   Waves of students pelted police with rocks and firebombs,
setting some troopers ablaze. Police tried to fend off the missiles
with shields during the hour-long clash.
   ``Down with the dictators' Olympics,'' and ``Yankee go home,''
radicals yelled as they charged lines of riot police blocking the
streets with shields.
   Police martial arts squads with long batons charged the
students, beating and kicking some protesters. But police were
pushed back several times by counter-attacking students.
   Some police and students were injured by firebombs and rocks,
but police had no casualty figures. There were no reports of
arrests.
   The fighting was confined to the streets in front of the school
in northeastern Seoul, about 15 miles from where the Games are
being held. Students from other Seoul colleges took part.
   Firemen called in by police tried to douse exploding firebombs
with hoses, but students drove them off with more missiles.
   Police were hampered in the fighting because of a government ban
on using tear gas during the Olympics to try and preserve peace.
The police hurled stones and rocks, but had no effective way of
fighting back without tear gas.
   Police tried to avoid a clash, staying in backstreets while the
students blocked the main road and tore down part of the school's
walls. Students attacked with firebombs as soon as police moved in.
   Radicals said they would disrupt the Olympics, including the
mens' marathon on Sunday, if police do not release Oh. The student
leader was charged Tuesday with violating national security laws
for organizing anti-government demonstrations.
   Authorities have beefed up security for Olympic events in case
of student demonstrations and say the radicals won't be able to
disrupt any events.
   Radical leaders released a statement charging the government of
popularly elected President Roh Tae-woo is using the Olympics to
``cement dictatorship.''
   Students protesting against the government have staged
anti-Olympic protests to demand the Games be shared with communist
North Korea and to denounce the Roh administration.
   But just a handful of students have turned out for the mostly
peaceful protests. Most South Koreans want the Games to be a major
success and are critical of the radicals.
   North Korea is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to
co-host the Games was rejected by the International Olympic
Committee. The committee said the Games are awarded to a single
city and could not be shared.

<TEXT>
   Court papers seeking to dismiss a drug indictment
against Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega did not include
references to Vice President George Bush or his presidential
campaign as prosecutors had feared.
   The 65-page motion, which characterizes the case against the
Panamanian general as a political ploy, was unsealed Wednesday
after the U.S. attorney's office found it contained none of the
possible blackmail they believed Noriega might use to bargain with
the Reagan administration.
   ``My concern was that they would use it as some sort of
political leverage, but they didn't,'' said Richard Gregorie, chief
deputy assistant U.S. attorney. ``I don't think there is anything
in there that is shocking.''
   Noriega had previously claimed he had information that could
hurt the Bush campaign.
   Instead, the motion argues that the U.S. government has no right
to prosecute Noriega as a de facto head of state with diplomatic
immunity. It also says he has been targeted for political reasons
and that pretrial publicity will make it impossible to find an
objective jury.
   ``Whatever information damaging to George Bush that may exist,
that information was not going to be raised in our motion unless it
was relevant to the case,'' said Noriega's attorney, Neal Sonnett.
   The 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in
Miami in February accused Noriega of accepting $4.6 million in
bribes from Colombia's violent Medellin drug cartel. A grand jury
in Tampa indicted Noriega on three marijuana importation counts the
next day.
   The motion filed in Miami and sealed on Sept. 14 claims the
indictment was ``based upon impermissible considerations, including
political and foreign policy considerations.''
   Sonnett said one foreign policy issue was pressure by
conservatives in the Reagan administration to renegotiate the
Panama Canal Treaty, which was signed by President Carter and hands
full control of the waterway to Panama at the end of this century.
   ``There were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty,'' Sonnett
said. ``We argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to
a decision to attempt to get Noriega out of power.''
   The document contains quotes from the news media made by Reagan
administration officials, such as Undersecretary of State Elliot
Abrams, that the defense says demonstrate the political nature of
the case.
   Abrams, for example, is quoted as saying in May that ``the
indictment drove Noriega crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining
tool.''
   The defense, calling the case against Noriega ``indictment
diplomacy,'' notes that in March the Reagan administration offered
to guarantee it would not seek his extradition if he fled to Spain
and in May offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left
Panama.
   ``There can be no doubt ... that General Noriega has been
singled out for prosecution'' for political reasons, the attorneys
said.
   The defense motion also argues that Noriega is the first head of
state ever indicted in the United States for action taken within
his own country.
   Although Turks and Caicos Islands Prime Minister Norman Saunders
was convicted in Miami in 1985 on drug trafficking charges, the
defense notes that his activities took place here. And the
attorneys say the group of islands he led is not a sovereign nation
but a British colony, making Saunders only a local elected official.
   Saunders served two years of an eight-year prison term.

<HEAD>Family Quarrel Triggered Aboriginal Massacre, Say Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarrel over batteries for a portable
radio led to the Outback shooting deaths of a famed aboriginal bark
painter and five members of his family, police said today.
   Police said their prime suspect was the artist's son-in-law,
whose wife was among the victims, and that an extensive search by
air and with aboriginal trackers was under way for him in remote
Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory.
   Detective Superintendent Terry O'Brien of Darwin police said
several members of painter Dick Ngielu's family survived the
massacre and found help on Tuesday.
   They told police that Ngielu's son-in-law was angry because
there were no batteries for the family radio. He also had a fight
with his wife, Cecelia, over the sale of some bark pictures for
$160, arguing she should have given the money to her father and not
spent it, O'Brien said.
   He said the son-law was aged 22, but did not identify him.
   The family, according to eyewitnesses, was shot to death at
close range with a 12-gauge shotgun.
   Also killed was Ngielu's wife, Dolly, and Cecelia's two sons,
aged two and four. Another man, believed to be Ngielu's brother,
was also slain.
   The Australian National Gallery in Canberra owns two of Ngielu's
bark paintings and said it would seek permission from his tribe to
exhibit them. It is taboo under aboriginal tribal law to mention
the named of a deceased until 12 months after his death.
   Arts Curator Wally Caruana said the gallery was seeking
permission to display the two bark works. One depicts two women and

   O'Brien said the family members trekked about 30 miles before
they were found by geologists, who had just arrived on a field trip.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Gene Transplant Approach for Treating AIDS</HEAD>

   Mouse cells given a gene that stymies a herpes
virus resisted the spread of a herpes infection, suggesting that
gene transplants in people might help treat AIDS infections,
scientists said today.
   The idea gained support from a Nobel Prize-winning researcher,
but a gene transplant expert says the strategy has failed to show
promise so far in other experiments.
   The new work, done in test tubes, was reported in today's issue
of the British journal Nature by scientists at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington.
   Although researchers would face major hurdles in developing the
technique to fight AIDS, ``it's a very good thing for them to think
about,'' said study co-author Steven McKnight.
   His experiments dealt with the herpes simplex virus type 1,
which causes cold sores and fever blisters in people. Researchers
focused on a virus protein called VP16, which the virus needs to
activate some of its genes and complete its reproductive cycle.
   The virus makes the protein under instructions from a gene.
Researchers isolated that gene and altered it so that it would give
instructions for a defective form of the protein.
   Then they planted the gene into mouse cells in such a way that
the cells and their progeny produced a defective form of VP16. The
idea was that after the virus entered a cell and tried to
reproduce, the defective VP16 would elbow out the virus's own
version. That would block reproduction, preventing any progeny from
infecting more cells.
   Results showed that 24 hours after infection with the herpes
virus, a group of cells with the implanted gene had 40 times less
virus than a group of normal infected cells did.
   A similar approach might fight infection by the virus that
causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, researchers wrote.
   The procedure would involve removing bone marrow, inserting the
gene in the ``stem'' cells that produce the body's blood cells, and
putting the altered cells back in the person, McKnight said. The
gene may then be passed on to blood cells, which are targets for
the AIDS virus.
   It is too early to know if such an approach would work, McKnight
said in a telephone interview. Among the questions it raises are
how to design and insert the protective gene, and whether the gene
would make the blood cells perform abnormally.
   In a Nature editorial, Nobel laureate David Baltimore said he
believes the strategy ``has as good a chance as any other procedure
of becoming a real AIDS therapy'' for infected people, despite
formidable obstacles in developing it.
   With the new results, it is realistic to try animal experiments
and work with the AIDS virus, wrote Baltimore, director of the
Whitehead Institute for Medical Research in Cambridge, Mass.
   But in an interview, gene transplant researcher W. French
Anderson of the National Institutes of Health said other scientists
are investigating gene transplants for AIDS, and ``there isn't
anything yet that could even be called promising.''
   Anderson said scientists have not yet found a way to make
transplanted genes perform well in animals in general. Nor have
they learned to insert genes into brain cells, which the AIDS virus
also infects, he said.
   No gene transplant research involving AIDS has shown enough
promise to try animal experiments, Anderson said.

<HEAD>Four Convicted In Exotic Bird Smuggling Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury convicted four people of smuggling
exotic birds worth an estimated $250,000 into the United States
from Cuba as some of the key evidence squawked for water in Spanish.
   ``Agua!'' a scarlet macaw cried as the jury deliberated
Wednesday.
   A fifth defendant was acquitted on all charges, but remains in
custody in a separate cocaine case. All those convicted face up to
10 years in prison.
   ``This isn't just a wildlife case; this is a money case,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gelber said in closing arguments.
``According to the information we have recieved, the parrot carries
a price tag of $3,000, the macaw $2,500. ... They were going to
make a lot of money.''
   Three defendants were convicted of two counts each of violating
the Lacey Act, which regulates the movement of endangered species,
and one count each of conspiring. The fourth was convicted only on
the violations.
   The five were arrested on a boat off the Florida Keys in April.
Six of the 243 confiscated birds, including the macaw, a Cuban
Amazon parrot, a pair of melodious finches and a mustached
parakeet, were brought into court as evidence.
   Although the birds were taken to the Metro Zoo in Miami, only 42
of the 193 melodious finches survived. Two of the 48 parrots later
died of a parasite infection.
   The defendants claimed they were transporting the animals from
Miami to the Keys when they had engine trouble and radioed the
Coast Guard for help.
   ``It is not my responsibility to prove where the birds came
from,'' said defense attorney Ellis Rubin. ``It's the government's
responsibility, and they have not done so.''
   Rubin said he would appeal.
   On Tuesday, two defendants who were free on bond in the bird
case were arrested as they left the courtroom.
   Carlos Fernandez, 27, was indicted for unlawful possession of a
machine gun, and Rigoberto Cherta Garcia, 42, was accused of
marijuana conspiracy. Both were convicted in the bird case
Wednesday.
   The other convicted defendants were Nancy Lopez, 50, and Jose
Flores, 24.
   Felix Valdes, 39, was acquitted.

Scientist Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A clerical error marred a key calculation in a
study suggesting that unseen comet-like objects are traveling near
Earth's orbit, says a scientist who admits, ``I blew it.''
   But the objects may still exist, said Thomas Donahue of the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
   Donahue was one of three authors who published the study last
December in the British journal Nature.
   They suggested the small objects, called ``cometesimals,'' may
strike Earth every 80 years, and may be responsible for many
craters on the moon.
   The cometesimals, ranging in diameter from a few yards to a few
tens of yards, may also be building blocks of ordinary comets, the
researchers wrote. But the objects may not throw off much dust,
making them hard to spot from Earth, they said.
   The work was based on what appeared to be a higher amount of
hydrogen atoms between the orbital paths of Earth and Mars than
could be attributed to known causes. Cometesimals were proposed as
a possible source.
   In today's issue of Nature, however, University of Arizona
researchers said their re-analysis of the same data from the
Voyager 2 spacecraft showed no inexplicable excess of hydrogen
atoms.
   In a telephone interview, Donahue said the mistake in the
original paper occurred because a student misread a number from a
table of data. That caused a crucial calculation to underestimate
the amount of hydrogen that a theory predicts would be found in
outer space.
   The underestimate created the gap that was explained by the
cometesimal proposal.
   ``I don't even want to blame the student. I should have
checked,'' Donahue said. ``I blew it, that's all.''
   He said estimates of the expected concentration of hydrogen in
outer space are not firm, and that revised figures still leave some
room for the existence of cometesimals. Observations by the Galileo
spacecraft, which is scheduled to be launched next year, should
reveal whether they exist, he said.

<HEAD>Second Pill Said Effective in Terminating Early Pregnancies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abortion pill able to safely end early
pregnancies, much like a pill recently approved for use in France
and China, has been successfully tested by Dutch scientists.
   The latest medicine, called epostane, worked in 84 percent of
women who used it in the fifth through eighth weeks of pregnancy,
researchers reported today.
   Dr. Marinus J. Crooij and colleagues from Elisabeth Gasthuis in
Haarlem, Netherlands, gave the drug to 50 women who were planning
to have abortions. They reported their results in today's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   ``We conclude that epostane taken orally is an effective and
safe method for the non-invasive termination of undesired early
pregnancy,'' they wrote.
   The researchers speculated that using epostane with RU 486 might
be more effective than either alone.
   Tests showed RU 486 or mifepristone, which was approved earlier
this month for use in France and China, was 95 percent effective.
Neither drug is available in the United States, where anti-abortion
activists have threatened to boycott products of any drug company
that produces such a pill.
   Both drugs work by interferring with progesterone, a hormone
essential during the first weeks of pregnancy for the implantation
of a fertilized egg on the uterine wall.
   Proponents of such pills consider them a simpler, safer
alternative to traditional abortions. Opponents, including the
Roman Catholic Church, say they are just another way to kill the
unborn.
   With the new pills, there is no surgical act. No anesthesia is
needed and there is no risk of infection, sterility or of
perforating the uterus, but RU 486 research has turned up
hemorrhaging in a small percentage of users.

   Reports that Michael Dukakis has scaled back
expectations in the South and West have prompted his rival's
campaign to claim the regions for George Bush. A Dukakis aide
dismissed this as ``a Republican fantasy'' and said Democrats have
actually bolstered their staffing in the South.
   Top campaign aides to Bush said the vice president has a lock on
the South and the Rocky Mountain region, leaving him free to
compete with the Democratic presidential nominee in a handful of
key states.
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater and political director Rich
Bond, in a telephone news conference Wednesday with Boston
reporters, said they are delighted with comments by anonymous
Dukakis campaign officials who say they have scaled back
expectations in those two regions.
   But Dukakis campaign spokesman Mark Gearan said it was ``a
Republican fantasy that we would pull out of the South.''
   ``Lee has been saying this for some time hoping it would come
true,'' he said. ``It will not. We have more people working in the
South today than this time last week.''
   Gearan said recent polls have shown Dukakis competitive with
Bush across the South.
   Dukakis aides have said privately in recent days they intend to
compete vigorously in several key states while scaling back the
campaign elsewhere.
   ``It's interesting to see a Dukakis 50-state strategy come to an
abrupt halt,'' Atwater said.
   The two Bush strategists said the vice president is banking on a
solid block of support across the South and Rocky Mountain states
and will focus his campaign on nine key states: New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Texas, Washington
and California.
   Bond said the states Bush counts as solidly behind his campaign
account for 200 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win on Nov. 8.
Dukakis, according to Bond, can count on only 170 electoral votes.
   ``We need to win only two or three of those (nine) states while
Dukakis would have to win five to seven depending on whether
California was among that group,'' Bond said. ``So we can
concentrate on fewer states,'' Bond said.
   ``We're going to be concentrating on California, Ohio, Michigan
and states like that and we can feel that the southern and Rocky
Mountain states are intact,'' Bond said.
   Conservative to centrist voters in the key states would disagree
with Dukakis' opposition to the death penalty, his past policy of
furloughs for first-degree murderers, his membership in the
American Civil Liberties Union and his veto of a bill that would
have required teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of
Allegiance, Atwater said.
   A survey of campaign trips over the past two months published
Wednesday by The Patriot Ledger of Quincy, Mass., indicates that if
appearances by the candidate are any indication, neither Bush nor
Dukakis is running a 50-state campaign.
   The survey listed 20 states that Dukakis has not yet visited and
26 states where Bush has yet to make an appearance.
   California and Texas topped the travel lists of both candidates
for obvious reasons. California carries the most electoral votes
with 47, while Texas carries 29. Dukakis has spent all or part of
eight days in California since accepting the Democratic nomination
July 21 while Bush has spent six days there. Those numbers were
reversed in Texas.

<TEXT>
   The sounds of chain saws and combines
are part of the country music, as thousands of farmers journey to a
1,400-acre stretch of northern Illinois for an agricultural
exposition billed as the world's largest.
   ``My fear was that they would be in a real down mood because of
the drought and poor yields, but they seem to be optimistic,'' said
Don Nichols, one of the 340 commercial exhibitors at the event,
which wraps up tonight.
   For Nichols and other exhibitors, the idea is to attract the
attention of an estimated 200,000 farmers from as near as Indiana
and Iowa and as far as New York.
   They do it with displays like balloons, wagons stacked five
high, sculptors carving with chain saws, and antique tractors.
   ``We're here to show them our products and, hopefully, write
orders,'' said Nichols, a salesman for J. M. Schultz Seed Co.
   As farmers stroll away from the 60-acre midway, they are
surrounded by test plots with 400 varieties of corn and 260
varieties of soybeans, as well as information on herbicides, new
machinery, and farming tips.
   ``I come here to get ideas,'' said Lowell McCollough of Bourbon,
Ind., who farms 276 acres and carried a plastic bag full of product
brochures and microwave popcorn samples.
   One insurance company offers a bingo game to entertain visitors,
while a university offers advice and testing on the impact of
agricultural noise on farmers' hearing.
   Some show visitors gathered to welcome Vice President George
Bush when he visited the area Wednesday, while barkers from the
food tents strolled the exhibit area soliciting customers.
   ``If you eat at Tent 5, it'll keep you alive,'' said Alberta
Strasser of nearby Creston, wearing a red-and-white clown suit and
a black hat with a yellow flower.
   ``There is a lot of competition _ there are five food tents.
But, business is tremendous,'' she said.
   At one of the exhibits, Frank Bretthauer put on his goggles and
guided his chain saw into the wood, turning a rough log into a
carved bear as a crowd gathered to watch.
   ``The idea is to stop them as they walk by, and the carving is
the big crowd-pleaser,'' said Bretthauer, a chain saw salesman from
Tonganoxie, Kan. ``It's well worth being at this shows _ our sales
in the state always go up 15 percent.''
   Carving the wood is not as easy as some people think, and
cutting even a simple square can be tricky.
   ``You start off to make a bear,'' Bretthauer said. ``You cut the
nose too short, so you do a coyote. My first carvings became
firewood.''
   Manager Tom Budd said the farm show began as a one-day event in
1953, and expanded to a three-day show in 1960. It moves from
Illinois to Indiana to Iowa, sponsored by Prairie Farmer Magazine.
   ``We wanted to bring advertisers and farmers together to see the
latest advances in science and technology, and see machinery
operate under normal field conditions,'' Budd said. ``The idea
clicked.''
   The show is held on the land of five families who farm around
this Lee County community, about 75 miles southwest of Chicago.
   ``At first, we didn't know if we wanted to get involved,'' said
Duane Ackland, one of the host farmers. ``But, it benefits the
community, and it makes you feel good to do something for the
future.''

   Intense thunderstorms swept through the central and southern
Plains today with heavy rain, hail as big as golf balls and winds
that destroyed a boat dock and downed power lines.
   In north-central Texas near the Oklahoma border, the overnight
storms pelted View with golf ball-size hail and Burkburnett with
1-inch hail.
   Winds ripped down a carport, destroyed the boat dock and downed
electrical lines near Graham. Winds gusting to 60 mph in Olney
toppled trees.
   A line of thunderstorms brought high winds, hail and drenching
rains to western Missouri. Kansas City was deluged with 4 inches of
rain. A few people were trapped in cars after attempting to drive
through high water that pooled in low-lying areas. Near the
downtown airport, water 5 to 6 feet deep was reported.
   A strong thunderstorm near Maple City, Kan., brought hail the
size of golf balls.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also scattered over southeast
Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi and Alabama. Scattered showers fell over
eastern Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over the Mississippi Valley and eastern portions of the Plains;
numerous showers and thunderstorms over the middle Mississippi
Valley; scattered showers and thunderstorms over the southern third
of Florida; strong, gusty winds over the northern Rockies; and
mostly sunny skies over the rest of the country.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 50s and 60s over the
middle and northern Atlantic Coast states, the Great Lakes, the
upper Mississippi Valley, Iowa, the central and northern Plains,
Oklahoma, and the central Rockies; in the 90s over south central
Texas, the desert Southwest and inland valleys of California; and
in the 70s and 80s through the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 85 degrees at Yuma,
Ariz.

<DATELINE>BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's highest court
today upheld the death sentence of a white man convicted of killing
a black policeman and trying to make the slaying look like the work
of black radicals.
   Henry Burt, 35, faces hanging unless President P.W. Botha
commutes the sentence. No execution date was announced.
   Burt was convicted last year of beating Sgt. Johannes Ndimande
into unconsciousness in June 1986, placing a gasoline-soaked tire
around his neck, and setting it on fire. No clear motive was
established in the trial.
   That method of killing is called ``necklacing.'' The government
says scores of blacks were ``necklaced'' from 1984 through 1987 by
black radicals who suspected them of collaborating with white
authorities.
   Burt, a former soldier who worked for the state-run Nuclear
Development Corp., pleaded innocent at his trial, though he said he
gave the policeman a lift that night.
   Part of Burt's defense was that he attended a meeting before the
killing at which white residents complained about rising black
crime. But the Appeal Court rejected that defense in today's ruling.

<HEAD>President Says News Media Should Show Restraint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said today that
the news media of South Korea and the United States should show
restraint and avoid reports that may provoke the sentiments of
their people.
   Roh made the remarks after receiving a briefing on growing
anti-U.S. sentiment in South Korea during the Olympics now under
way in Seoul.
   ``The news media of the two countries now should report in a way
not to provoke the sentiments of each other's people,'' Roh said
during a visit to the main Olympic press center.
   The president commented on a raging controversy involving the
NBC, saying the American television network's reports of South
Korea were ``mostly affirmative.''
   ``Even if the reports of NBC included something that hurt our
self-esteem, we should put up with it, since most of the network's
reorts were affimative,'' he said.
   NBC has been a target of South Korean criticism because of its
extensive coverage of South Korean boxing officials' assault on a
New Zealand referee after one of their Olympic boxers lost a close
decision last week.
   The allegedly ``biased'' coverage of NBC and incidents involving
American athletes, including the arrests of two U.S. gold medalist
swimmers after a mask was taken from a hotel, touched off a new
wave of anti-American sentiments.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae also took up the issue today and
said, ``We should not let one-time feelings damage the
traditionally friendly relations between the United States and our
nation.''
   Governing and opposition politicians also expressed concern
about rising anti-U.S. and pro-Soviet sentiment in South Korea and
warned that the trend could hurt South Korea's national interest.
   South Koreans enthusiastically backed the Soviet Union in its
victorious semifinal basketball match with the United States on
Wednesday.
   Governing party officials said the Soviet Union, which has no
diplomtic relations with Seoul, appeared to have won the favor of
the South Korean people with extensive cultural programs even
before the Olympic Games opened Sept. 17.
   In an elaborate approach to South Korea, the Soviet Union sent
to Seoul the a Bolshoi ballet contingent, a philharmonic orchestra
and two choir groups plus a sports photo exhibition.

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Higher In Listless Trading, Gold Also Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly higher against most
currencies in listless European trading this morning but dealers
said its rise had been capped by Monday's round of central bank
intervention.
   Gold bullion prices were also higher in choppy trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said that despite the central bank
intervention, market sentiment still favored a higher dollar.
   The Deutsche Bundesbank, the West German central bank, was
rumored to have asked for dollar rates in the foreign exchange
market early in the day, but dealers said they don't expect an
intervention as long as trading is calm.
   A dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said the dollar was being
supported by concern over the political trend in the Soviet Union,
where party leader Mikhail Gorbachev is facing a key test in a
party meeting this week.
   ``There is nothing coming out of (the joint annual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in) Berlin, so
people are focusing a bit on these political events,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.15 yen to a closing 134.35 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.23 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates:

<HEAD>Government Claims Civil Servants Back At Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The military government claims more than
half the personnel at five ministries in Rangoon have quit a
pro-democracy general strike, but a Western diplomat said today
that the workers only planned to pick up their paychecks.
   A general strike that began Aug. 8 has become the most effective
form of protest since Gen. Saw Maung staged a coup Sept. 18 and
brutally suprressed the daily anti-government street demonstrations.
   The state apparatus was crippled because most civil servants
left their posts, and Saw Maung has ordered the employees back to
work by Monday.
   But the National League for Democracy, the main opposition
alliance seeking an end to 26 years of rule by a military
autocracy, has urged workers to remain on strike until democracy is
won.
   State radio said Wednesday that attendance at the Ministry of
Planning and Finance was up to 74 percent.
   Other departments with more than half the workforce showing up
were the ministries of Health, Home and Religious Affairs, Culture
and Trade, the broadcast said.
   ``A lot of people are going back to work now so they can pick up
their paycheck,'' said a Western diplomat in Bangkok, Thailand, who
noted that pay day comes at the end of the month in Burma. ``We've
had reports of people sitting around drinking tea.''
   The diplomat added if the civil servants do not get paid ``that
would be a very inflammatory thing.''
   Prices for several basic commodities, including rice and
gasoline, have skyrocketed during the recent anti-government
protest, making it increasingly difficult for families to get by.
   Troops today drove away sidewalk hawkers in downtown Rangoon who
have been a major form of commerce since large markets closed after
the coup. No reason was given for the move, and similar streetside
shops still were seen in other areas of the capital.
   Residents, meanwhile, say about fifty truckloads of troops left
Rangoon on Monday, possibly to frontier areas where rebel groups
reportedly are mounting offensives. The government has reported
fierce fighting with Communist rebels in northeastern outposts.
   Soldiers had been brought to the capital from outlying regions
to put down the anti-government demonstrations.
   Diplomats say many unarmed civilians were shot to death Sept. 19
by troops breaking up street protests. The official death toll
since the coup is about 350, although the National League for
Democracy says nearly 1,000 were killed.
   The league, led by retired brigadier general Aung Gyi,
officially registered as a political party Wednesday but did not
say if it would participate in elections promised by Saw Maung.
   No date has been set for the vote.
   A second pro-democracy group, made up of followers of one-time
Prime Minister U Nu, also registered, while a third opposition
political party announced its formation.
   The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party, which had been the
sole political party since 1962 earlier, renamed itself the New
Unity Party. Western analysts say Saw Maung is behind the group,
which has a well-established, amply funded nationwide network.

<HEAD>L.A. Mayor Unveils Plan to Cut Truck Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Tom Bradley's plan to ease some of the
nation's worst traffic congestion and air pollution by putting the
brakes on rush-hour truck traffic triggered quick opposition from a
state truckers' organization.
   The plan announced Wednesday is intended to keep out up to 70
percent of the heavy-duty trucks that normally operate on city
streets during peak travel hours.
   ``No one doubts that truck shipments are vital to our economy,''
Bradley said. ``The old saying, `If you got it, a truck brought
it,' still largely applies. But there is no reason so many truck
deliveries must be made during these peak rush-hour travel times.''
   Karen Rasmussen, spokeswoman for the California Trucking
Association, called Bradley's plan unfortunate and suggested it
would not have a significant impact on traffic.
   A recent state Department of Transportation study found that
large trucks make up only 4.4 percent of peak-hour traffic in the
morning and 2.8 percent in the evening, said Ms. Rasmussen, whose
group represents more than 2,500 companies.
   Bradley, who detailed the plan at a smoggy press conference
surrounded by big rigs on the downtown Sports Arena parking lot,
said it has the support of major trucking companies, the South
Coast Air Quality Management District, state Department of
Transportation and the Highway Patrol.
   Under the proposal, which must still be approved by the City
Council, only 30 percent of large truck fleets could operate on
city roadways from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. The
ban does not apply to freeways, although officials expect it to
cause an indirect reduction there.
   The 30 percent of the trucks weighing 29,000 pounds or more that
fleet owners decide to operate would have to pay up to $60 for a
certificate. Stiff fines would be levied if a trucker operated
without the certificate.
   The fees would help fund a multi-agency ``rapid deployment
force'' that Bradley said would be used to clear snarled roadways
of broken-down vehicles.
   The plan allows for case-by-case exemptions, which will likely
cause the actual reduction to be about 50 percent, analysts with
the mayor's office said.
   No one is sure how many trucks operate in the Los Angeles area,
said Bill Bicker, the mayor's transportation policy adviser. He
estimated the number of heavy rigs at 300,000 and said about
100,000 of those could receive peak-hour exemptions under the plan.
   The program is unique because there is no direct effort to
restrict truck travel on freeways and highways, Bicker said. Such
attempts in other cities have been blocked by federal judges who
said they violate interstate commerce regulations.
   Dennis Woerner, manager of Pathfinder Trucking in Los Angeles,
which has a fleet of more than 20 large rigs, predicted truckers
will be able to adapt more readily than shippers and receivers.
   ``Trucking is a 24-hour business. The shippers and receivers
will have to change their hours, and you're looking at a lot of
additional cost there,'' he said.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with two more deaths. NO pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two suspected Mafiosi were shot to death
on the main street of a Palermo suburb, raising to 16 the number of
people killed in gangland warfare in Sicily this week, police
reported today.
   The victims, identified as Giuseppe Leone, 63, and Giuseppe
Agrusa, 58, were killed in an ambush Wednesday night in Cinisi, a
town 12 miles outside this Sicilian capital.
   Police said they were believed to be low-ranking gang members.
   Others killed this week include an anti-Mafia judge and his son
and a Mafia boss and his wife.
   Officials have said there appears to be a major war between
rival Mafia factions under way on the island and have described it
as one the bloodiest gangland battles in recent years.
   Parliament is studying new measures to beef up the war on the
Mafia, and the Vatican called on the government to bring a halt to
the killings.
   ``Evidently there's a war going on,'' said state's attorney
Domenico Signorino, who helped prosecute Bontade in the mass trial
of more than 400 Mafia suspects that ended last December.
   The wave of gangland killings comes at a time when officials in
Sicily have complained the government was easing up on its
anti-Mafia campaign.
   An assassination Monday of Judge Antonio Saetta, who presided
over two major organized crime trials, was seen as an effort to
intimidate officials at future trials. Saetta sentenced two
powerful crime bosses, brothers Michele and Salvatore Greco, to
life in prison.

<HEAD>Young AIDS Victim To Continue Schooling At Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 7-year-old AIDS victim who is incontinent
and mentally disabled will continue her schooling at home while an
appellate panel decides whether to accept a plan allowing her to
attend school in a glass booth.
   An attorney for Eliana Martinez asked a three-judge panel
Wednesday to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Judge Elizabeth
Kovachevich permitting Eliana to attend a school for trainable
mentally disabled children under those conditions.
   Hillsborough County school officials placed the girl in
homebound instruction for fear she would transmit acquired immune
deficiency syndrome to other children, but Rosa Martinez won a
two-year legal battle in August to get her adoptive daughter into
the classroom.
   Refusing to send her daughter ``to sit in a cage,'' Mrs.
Martinez and her attorney Steve Hanlon turned to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for an expedited hearing.
   Mrs. Martinez attended the session and later was joined by
Eliana on the courthouse steps.
   ``Eliana will not go into that glass enclosure,'' Mrs. Martinez
vowed. ``She would not be happy there. I want her in a regular
classroom with trainable, mentally handicapped children just like
her.''
   The judges gave no indication when they would rule.
   Hanlon told the appellate panel he wasn't opposed to classroom
restrictions. But he suggested instead a kidney-shaped table as a
precaution to put distance between Eliana and other children.
   ``It's a tough, tough case,'' said Tom Gonzalez, an attorney for
the school board, adding there are no previous cases dealing with a
retarded, incontinent child with AIDS.
   Citing medical testimony from the trial, Hanlon said the risk of
the girl transmitting the disease to classmates was a ``remote,
theoretical potential.''
   But the appeals judges said that testimony referred only to
tears, saliva and urine, not to a condition of mouth sores and
cracked lips called oral thrush that Eliana has experienced. The
condition can result from AIDS.
   Judge Robert S. Vance said children touch each other's tongues
and disabled children are known to bite each other. Open sores in
the mouth could allow the transmission of blood, he said. To put a
child in such a situation ``may be sentencing those children to
death.''
   Hanlon said Eliana's doctors found no evidence of blood in the
mouth, but Eliana would be kept out of class if that occurred.
   Doctors believe Eliana became infected from blood transfusions
after her premature birth in Puerto Rico.
   Meanwhile, in Arcadia, DeSoto County School Board officials said
the family of three AIDS-exposed brothers once barred from the
classroom will receive less than $1 million to settle the family's
lawsuit against the board.
   The settlement with the family of Ricky, Robert and Randy Ray
does not require school officials to admit any negligence in the
way the boys or their family were treated, James Westberry, the
School Board chairman, said Wednesday. Westberry would not be more
specific about the amount of the settlement.
   Details of the out-of-court settlement were expected to be
released today after attorneys for both sides met with Kovachevich
in Tampa.
   Clifford and Louise Rays' suit sought unspecified damages. It
alleged that their sons' civil rights were violated.
   Ricky, 11, Robert, 10, and Randy, 8, have hemophilia. Doctors
say the boys probably came in contact with the AIDS virus from
infected blood-based hemophilia medication.

<HEAD>``Kitten'' Of ``Father Knows Best'' Leading Rejuvenated Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KILLEEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a little more than seven years, Lauren
Chapin was America's perfect little sister on TV's ``Father Knows
Best.''
   But when her career abruptly ended, the child actress who played
``Kitten'' became a drug addict, unwed mother and prison inmate.
   During her traumatic, turbulent adolescence, Ms. Chapin became a
has-been at 14, married at 16 and a heroin addict by her early 20s.
She spent three years in prison and bore two children out of
wedlock.
   But today she has found solace as a born-again Christian and a
high school science teacher in the small central Texas town of
Killeen.
   ``In Killeen, of all places,'' Chapin laughs. ``It's neat. I'm
not their token actress. My friends here love me for who I am now,
for what I do now, not who I was.''
   Kathy Anderson, or Kitten to her TV father, played by Robert
Young in the 1950s comedy, is now 43.
   Her once-brown hair is strawberry blond, her face angular and
unfreckled, her childhood chubbiness gone. But when she breaks into
her cheek-splitting grin and pealing laughter, the young Kathy
Anderson comes through loud and clear.
   ``I tried a lot of philosophies before I found the peace I'd
been looking for,'' she said. ``But when I did, my life changed.
There was a boldness that I had not had before ...''
   The third show-biz child of non-show-biz parents, she won her
first part before her seventh birthday, defeating 250 other girls
to play the youngest offspring in ``Father Knows Best.''
   Ms. Chapin says the TV show cast almost was a family, and when
the series ended suddenly she was not prepared.
   ``They never even said goodbye. We left one Friday night and got
a letter that we were not to return to work. It was total
abandonment,'' she said.
   As a short-statured, baby-faced 14-year-old, type cast to
millions as the all-American little sister, she found herself icily
rejected by the TV and movie industry, she said.
   She attempted to return to school, but it was a discipline for
which she was unprepared, she said.
   ``I never went to school longer than a month, and it was hard to
acclimate, to talk their lingo and try to fit in, especially when
you're a movie star, and the kids think you're conceited,'' Ms.
Chapin told the Dallas Times Herald.
   Ms. Chapin's mother was a creative, classically trained pianist
supportive of her daughter's ambitions. But at the same time, Ms.
Chapin said, her mother was a hard-drinking housewife who subjected
her children to debilitating verbal abuse. She said her
relationship with her father was even more turbulent.
   To escape, she said, at the age of 16 she married a classmate
she had known only 30 days. During their marriage of only three
years, Ms. Chapin said, she suffered seven miscarriages and became
addicted to heroin.
   After seven years of heavy heroin abuse, Ms. Chapin was
sentenced to prison for attempted forgery.
   ``I floated in the real seedy side of life from 14 up to 26,
caught up in the free-sex, free-drugs, free-love society.''
   After three years in the California Institute for Women, Ms.
Chapin entered a drug treatment program.
   During treatment, Chapin became engaged to another patient. When
she became pregnant with her son Matt, now 15, she decided to keep
her child but end the relationship.
   Five years later, Ms. Chapin had a second child, her daughter
Summer, out of wedlock. She said she did not believe a marriage to
the child's father would last. At that time, Ms. Chapin had a
steady job with a brokerage firm, was sober and drug free.
   Friends introduced her to Christianity, something she always had
rejected, she said, because she believed Christians were squares.
But she said the religious experience transformed her.
   ``I had lived in fear, in low self-esteem, but as I allowed
Christ in, all those things that had made me afraid and ashamed
were softened and released and healed.''
   She has shared that message through numerous speaking and
television appearances. She also is working on an autobiography,
due out next spring, titled ``Father Does Know Best.''
   In December, Ms. Chapin will marry Killeen firefighter Robert
Kelley.
   ``A lot of people say that `Father Knows Best' was too perfect,
that life isn't like that. But it should be like that, and it can
be like that.''

   By any standard except NASA's, you
couldn't find a more beautiful day for going flying at the Kennedy
Space Center today. The clouds were fleecy, the temperature mild
and visibility was forever. The winds were benign.
   And that was the problem: too benign. The computers aboard space
shuttle Discovery were configured with autumn conditions, expecting
winds aloft at about 40 knots _ 46 miles an hour at 20,000 feet.
Instead the readings were a spring-like 10-20 knots.
   If the winds did not pick up at least a little, NASA said it
would scrub the launch attempt and try again another day.
   ``If we were to fly through those, the computers that steer the
ship would overcompensate and cause a wobble,'' said astronaut Jon
McBride, who piloted a mission four years ago. ``This is a first,''
he added. ``I've never heard of a scrub because of mild winds.''
   In the pre-Challenger days, officials might have given the
go-ahead, but this is a new, more cautious regime.
   ``The bottom line is that its a lot more safe than it was before
the Challenger,'' NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``We probably went overboard just to be sure that there wasn't
anybody that was waiving something that shouldn't be waived. The
weather for example _ We're only about 5 or 6 percent out of
tolerance. Well, we might have waived that. We don't waive that
anymore.''

<HEAD>Hershiser Breaks Don Drysdale's Record For Consecutive Scoreless
Innings</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 1 graf with Dodgers winning NL West, to play Mets in

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser
broke Don Drysdale's 20-year-old record of 58 consecutive scoreless
innings by shutting out the San Diego Padres for 10 innings.
   Hershiser extended his streak to 59 innings and then was taken
out of Wednesday night's game after the 10th inning with a
scoreless tie. The Padres eventually won in the 16th inning, 2-1.
   Hershiser, whose won-loss record this season is 23-8, gave up
just four hits and did not allow a runner past first base until the
10th. He was seeking his sixth-straight shutout.
   After finishing the inning, the Dodgers streamed from the dugout
to congratulate their ace right-hander, who broke the major league
baseball mark set by Drysdale in 1968 with the Dodgers.
   ``I really and truly did not want to get the record,'' Hershiser
said in a dugout interview with Drysdale, now a Dodgers'
broadcaster. ``Out of respect of the man next to me, I feel I
should have stopped at two-thirds. I wanted to just put the ball
down out of respect for the guy next to me and baseball records.''
   ``But the guys next to me in the dugout kind of convinced me to
go for it,'' Hershiser said.
   Said Drysdale: ``If I had known that I would have been down
there kicking you by the seat of the pants.''
   Hershiser's arm helped propel the Dodgers to the National League
West title. Beginning Tuesday, they will play the New York Mets,
winner of the eastern division, for the league championship and a
berth in the World Series.

<TEXT>
   The World Bank will increase its yearly loans
nearly 50 percent by 1992 to help end poverty in the Third World,
the organization's president said today.
   Barber B. Conable spoke in West Berlin during the annual meeting
of the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary
Fund. Participants from 151 nations have spent a week exploring
ways to lighten the debt load of poor nations. The meeting ends
today.
   Leftist groups have mounted protests to criticize the
international banks, which make development loans, for insisting on
repayment by Third World nations.
   About 1,000 demonstrators gathered at a church nearby Wednesday
and chanted ``IMF Murder Meeting.'' Thousands of riot police held
them back with plastic shields.
   Third World countries owe about $1.2 trillion to international
and private lenders as well as governments.
   Conable predicted that the World Bank will be lending $25
billion dollars a year by 1992 to Third World nations. It now lends
about $17 billion a year, and the monetary fund provides about $8
million more.
   Speaking at a news conference, he said $5 billion will go to the
poorest countries, which are mainly in Africa.
   Conable said the bank will strengthen its aid by sharing more
financing with other donors. He said Japanese officials have told
him they plan to help and promised to talk with him about a program.
   Contributions to the bank come from the 151 member governments.
   Conable also pinpointed trade imbalances as part of the debt
problem faced by poor countries. He said they cause losses twice as
great as the aid such countries receive from wealthier nations.
   Speakers from the Third World have protested repeatedly at the
meeting that the industrial countries put up barriers to their
exports that prevent debtor countries from earning money.
   In an interview before his news conference, Conable said he
believed interest rates were stabilizing after recent increases.
   The financial leaders have listened this week to warnings that
higher interest rates, used by the United States and other
industrial countries to cool inflation, threaten the Third World.
   ``It would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for
inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises,''
said Giuliano Amato, Italy's treasury minister.
   At Wednesday's sessions, participants seeking new ways to ease
the burden of debt heard about the cost of higher interest rates to
Third World countries.
   Every 1 percent rise in interest rates costs the debtors $6
billion more a year, said Stanley Fischer, vice president and chief
economist of the World Bank.
   The United States and other industrial countries view higher
interest as a way of controlling price increases. In the United
States, higher interest rates also attract money from abroad to
meet the federal budget deficit.
   Third World countries pay more than $50 billion a year on loans
subject to variable interest rates.
   They complain that too much of their earnings go to pay
interest, leaving little to improve living standards. In many of
them, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, people's incomes have been
declining for 20 years.

<TEXT>
   Security forces arrested five more
suspected right-wing extremists and uncovered evidence of financial
support for efforts to topple President Corazon Aquino, the
military said today.
   Brig. Gen. Rudolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, said those arrested included three former soldiers
and two civilians. Four were arrested late Wednesday and the fifth
was captured today, Biazon said.
   Biazon told reporters they included retired Master Sgt. Domingo
Escarcha, alleged founder of the Black Force Commandos. The
commandos, made up of renegade soldiers, took part in the 1986 coup
attempt at the Manila Hotel and in other moves to topple the Aquino
government.
   The arrests brought to nearly 70 the number of suspected
right-wing extremists arrested in recent weeks. They included Lt.
Col. Eduardo Matillano, a leader of last year's bloody coup
attempt, who was arrested Tuesday.
   Biazon said that during the raids, police found copies of
documents pointing to financial support from unidentified ``outside
sources.''
   On Wednesday, Biazon told a House of Representatives committee
that unidentified businessmen and opposition politicians were under
surveillance for possible links to military renegades, including
former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan.
   Honasan led the failed coup Aug. 28, 1987, which killed at least
53 people and wounded 300. Matillano was one of Honasan's key
lieutenants during the failed coup.
   Both were later arrested but escaped separately last April.
   In Wednesday's congressional testimony, Biazon said the business
executives and politicians were providing ``financial support and a
political component'' to the anti-Aquino movement.
   He said the military was collecting evidence ``before we take up
action.''
   The opposition Union for National Action, led by Vice President
Salvador Laurel, has demanded in a statement that Mrs. Aquino
release immediately the names of all those suspected of links to
Honasan and other rebel soldiers.
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the vice chairman of the
union, denied he was personally linked to the mutineers and said he
was ready to defend himself in court if the government tried to
implicate him.
   Enrile was fired as defense minister in 1986 after a failed coup
by his followers. Honasan was Enrile's chief of security when he
held the defense post.
   Also today, police shot and killed four people after they robbed
an American army officer who had just arrived at Manila's airport,
and soldiers killed six other people in another incident near
Manila's airport, officials said.
   Police identified the robbery victim as Army Capt. Michael
Smith. They said four armed men stole his luggage and valuables,
then sped off in a car and were later chased by police officers.
   Soldiers killed six people they said refused to stop at a
checkpoint, officials said. Troops claimed the occupants opened
fire, triggering a shootout near the Manila airport. No casualties
were reported among the soldiers.

   A U.S.-Soviet clash over Afghanistan
remains unresolved, but U.S. officials do not expect it to slow the
Red Army's withdrawal from the embattled country.
   Charging Pakistan and, indirectly, the United States with
violating the Geneva accords aimed at ending the Afghan war, the
Soviet Union on Wednesday hinted it might suspend its pullout
unless U.S. aid to Afghan guerrillas ends.
   A senior Soviet official said today neither the Soviet Union nor
the Afghan government would be at fault if the Geneva agreement was
reduced to ``a useless piece of paper.'' Ambassador-at-large
Nicolai Kozyrev made his comment to reporters in New Dehli.
   But a government spokesman in Islamabad said Pakistan is not
worried as long as Moscow meets its Feb. 15 deadline for a complete
withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``It does not alarm us. We expect that the Soviet Union will
abide by its obligations,'' said Humayun Khan, secretary of state
for foreign affairs.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze registered the Soviet
complaint at a meeting of the five permanant members of the
Security Council, chaired by Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz leveled a counterclaim that
Soviet and Afghan bombing raids have violated Pakistani airspace.
   Shultz urged that the dispute be explored by United Nations
observers, who so far have not documented violations on either
side, said State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman.
   Shultz then escorted Shevardnadze from the Secretariat building
and the Soviet news agency Tass said the Soviet foreign minister
later flew home for a high-level Communist Party meeting.
   The two appeared grim and did not respond to reporters'
questions.
   But later, Redman said the Soviets ``left the impression'' they
would maintain their troop withdrawal schedule. Under a
U.N.-mediated accord signed in Geneva in April, the Soviets agreed
to pull out all of their troops by February.
   Moscow sent more than 100,000 troops into Afghanistan since
December 1979 to help prop up a Marxist government that is fighting
Moslem guerrillas backed by the United States, Pakistan, Iran,
China and other countries.
   A communique was released after the meeting of Shultz,
Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of China, Britain and France
that stressed the urgency for ``continuous talks'' to end the war
between Iran and Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   While State Department officials in Washington said they
expected the troop withdrawal to be completed by Feb. 15, as
specified in the Geneva accords, a Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman hinted at a slowdown.
   ``We want to be as good as our word is concerning the Geneva
accords,'' said the spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov. ``But we expect
the other side also to be as good as its word.''
   The Soviet official accused Pakistan of violations in supplying
``so-called freedom fighters'' with weapons. And Gerasimov
broadened the complaint to include the United States.
   ``I guess they come from the American military-industrial
complex, mainly,'' he said. ``The Geneva accords say that Pakistan
must not try to overthrow the government of Kabul. If you encourage
the so-called freedom fighters to use the missiles to kill innocent
people in the (Afghan) cities, I think it is a violation in our
eyes.''
   Gerasimov said the Security Council was ``a good place to
discuss fulfillment'' of the Geneva accords. The session, attended
also by Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, and
Foreign Ministers Roland Dumas of France and Qian Qichen of China,
was arranged before Shevardnadze's departure for Moscow.
   The Soviet spokesman acknowledged a Soviet pilot crossed the
Pakistan border several weeks ago. But Gerasimov stressed
Pakistan's support for the rebels at war with the Afghan government.
   ``It is a grave situation, and we must do something about it,''
he said.

<HEAD>Hundreds Revolt Against Docking Of Poison Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANFREDONIA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people today stoned the
town hall, blocked roads and clashed with riot police to protest
the government's decision to allow a ship loaded with toxic waste
to dock in this southern port.
   Most shops, public offices and schools were closed following a
general strike called by local trade unions.
   ``It looks like a serious revolt,'' said one police officer who
spoke on condition of anonymity. He said there were reports of
injuries among police and demonstrators.
   The incidents broke out shortly after the federal government
ruled that the Deep Sea Carrier should be allowed to dock at
Manfredonia, along the Adriatic coast. The ship is carrying 2,500
tons of toxic waste and is expected to arrive at Manfredonia in a
few days.
   The waste, originally shipped by Italian industrial companies to
Nigeria for disposal, has been ordered returned to Italy by
Nigerian authorities.
   Demonstrators shouting anti-government slogans hurled stones at
the town hall, smashing windows and damaging parked cars.
Protesters overturned police cars during scattered clashes with
officers, according to city officials.
   Demonstrators, who are urging local authorities to defy the
government decision and turn back the Deep Sea Carrier, also
blocked several main roads, touching off major traffic jams.
   No Italian port wants to accept the chemical wastes. Two
freighters, the Karin-B and Khiam Fea, also are carrying waste and
have been accompanying the Deep Sea Carrier.
   Karin-B has been moored off the Tyrrhenian port of Leghorn for
10 days. Local authorities and residents don't want to unload it
until the national government announces a plan for disposal of the
waste elsewhere.
   Khiam Fea is sailing toward the Adriatic port of Ravenna, where
protests have also taken place.
   According to Italian companies that shipped the waste through an
agent, Nigeria had originally authorized dumping of it in Koko but
later reneged on the agreement.

<HEAD>High Court Censure's Judge for Rude Behavior Toward Woman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's highest court has censured a judge for
rudeness to a woman who sought court protection from her violent
husband, but allowed him to continue on the bench, a decision
criticized by the woman's family.
   Somerville District Judge Paul A. Heffernan did grant a
protection order, but the woman, Pamela Nigro Dunn, was later
murdered by her husband.
   The Supreme Judicial Court on Wednesday expressed its
disapproval of Heffernan's ``discourtesy, rudeness and sarcasm''
toward Mrs. Dunn at a 1986 hearing. The decision involves no fine
or reduction in Heffernan's powers and essentially follows the
recommendation more than a year ago of Heffernan's attorney.
   The five justices dismissed allegations of a pattern of
discourteousness by Heffernan toward women. They noted Heffernan
granted Mrs. Dunn the protection she sought from her husband, Paul,
who had beaten her.
   They also said Heffernan's rude behavior toward Mrs. Dunn had
nothing to do with her murder in August 1986.
   Carole Nigro, Mrs. Dunn's mother, said the high court should
have specifically barred Heffernan from hearing domestic cases.
   ``I'm not saying he was the cause of her murder, but just the
way he handles women in court is wrong,'' she said.
   The Nigros initiated the case two years ago by charging that
Heffernan humiliated and belittled Mrs. Dunn.
   The high court recommended private censure of Heffernan,
meaning, in most cases, that its ruling would never be made public.
But the court decided to publicize its decision because of the
publicity the case has received.
   Heffernan, 55, of Boston, did not return phone calls seeking
comment. His attorney, Thomas Dwyer Jr., said the judge accepts the
ruling.
   In its decision, the court proposed creation of a process by
which a judge's performance can be evaluated and improved
confidentially.
   Dwyer said Heffernan considered the matter closed. He said
Heffernan had voluntarily withdrawn from domestic dispute cases and
had no immediate plans to resume hearing them.

   There was more at stake than pride and adventure. The 32-month
grounding of the shuttle fleet has set back the nation's
satellite-delivery system. Discovery's first order of business in
space was release of a $100 million communications satellite.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, to be released six hours
after liftoff, is a twin of a craft lost with Challenger.
   ``This has been a long 2{ years,'' shuttle chief Truly said of
the months of remorse, restructuring and rebuilding that followed
the explosion that shook America's confidence in its space effort.
   Excitement built at the Kennedy Space Center area as launch
neared. Campers and recreation vehicles found viewing places along
the Indian River. Souvenir sellers set up shop. Police handled a
series of pre-dawn traffic jams and guesstimated the crowd at a
rather modest quarter-of-a-million.
   Not since the first shuttle flight, in 1981, has there been such
interest in an American launch. During the past 32 months, 16
Soviet cosmonauts have traveled to space, leaving the United States
far behind in whatever remains of the space race.
   Hauck said in a prelaunch interview that he recognized the great
significance of his mission.
   ``We clearly cannot afford to lose another vehicle, much less
another crew,'' he said. ``I don't think the manned space program
could withstand another Challenger.''
   ``Flying into space never will be risk free,'' Hauck said.
``It's a matter of reducing the risks to a minimum and balancing
the risks that are involved with what we are trying to accomplish.''
   During the four-day orbital journey, the astronauts planned to
conduct 11 science and technology experiments and to test design
changes to the shuttle.
   Hauck said they planned a special memorial in space for
Challenger's five man, two woman crew. The nature of the memorial
would be revealed during a news conference the astronauts were to
hold in orbit on the mission's third day, he said.
   ``If we ever forget what happened to Challenger, it's going to
be a sad day, because we might become complacent once again,''
Hilmers said.
   Covey reported the flight will be less complicated than most
previous missions because NASA has elected to take a conservative
approach.
   In all, 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones have been
made to the shuttle. The program to redesign all three remaining
shuttles cost $2.4 billion.
   The effort focused on the two solid fuel booster rockets that
help thrust the shuttle into space. Flame escaped through a faulty
joint in Challenger's right booster and touched off the explosion.
   A cold temperature of 38 degrees at launch time contributed to
the accident by stiffening O-ring seals, preventing them from
sealing the joint. Some engineers had argued with lower-level
managers against launching in the cold, but their concerns were not
relayed to those making the launch decision.
   That prompted significant changes in the way NASA and contractor
managers communicate with their workers and led to creation of the
countdown oversight team headed by Robert Crippen.
   ``Under the new system,'' Crippen said, ``the lines of
communications are open to anyone, anywhere in the system.''
   Among the changes to the orbiter was the addition of an
emergency escape system featuring a blowout cabin hatch and a
12-foot aluminum and steel telescoping pole. In case of a problem
during a landing attempt while the shuttle is in stable, gliding
flight, the astronauts could slide down the pole, clearing the
wings, and parachute to safety. The system would not be of use in a
Challenger-type accident.
   Because of the escape system, the astronauts were to wear the
cumbersome pressure suits on liftoff and landing, instead of the
comfortable cotton flight suits worn on recent missions.

   Workers held hostage by two gunmen at a
newspaper eight months ago say they suffered no physical damage,
but their sense of security is gone forever.
   ``I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder,''
accounting clerk Deborah Adams testified Wednesday. ``I don't feel
safe anywhere now.''
   She was one of 20 people held hostage at The Robesonian in
Lumberton for up to 10 hours Feb. 1 by two Indian activists
demanding an investigation of drug trafficking, racial
discrimination and corruption in Robeson County.
   ``I've had nightmares,'' said Rita Parker, the newspaper's
classified ad manager, who escaped from the newspaper building just
as the incident was getting under way. ``I found myself at work,
even months after that, watching the front door every time it
opened.''
   Defendants Eddie Hatcher, 31, and Timothy Jacobs, 20, are
charged with conspiracy, hostage taking and weapons violations.
They have never denied taking over the newspaper, but say they had
no other choice because their lives were in danger. They claim law
enforcement officers were planning to kill them because of their
charges.
   But the presiding judge in the case Wednesday disallowed
testimony that the takeover was in effect an act of self-defense.
   ``The `necessity defense' is not available to private citizens
who take vigilante action,'' U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle
said. ``The perpetrator of the harm has to be the object of the
action. ... You cannot randomly choose innocent persons to take
action against.''
   In a telephone call to The Associated Press late Wednesday
night, Hatcher said Boyle should be impeached, calling his decision
``outright wicked behavior.''
   Hatcher has not participated in the trial, claiming his
constitutional rights are being violated because his attorney of
choice, William Kunstler, is not present. Kunstler, the prominent
radical lawyer, is involved in a New York case, but Boyle denied a
request for another delay in the trial here until that trial winds
up.
   The workers who testified Wednesday said they thought they would
be killed when two men drew sawed-off shotguns from under their
long coats and chained the doors.
   ``I really thought we'd had it,'' said Jo Ann Manns, the
receptionist who first saw the gunmen. ``I thought they were going
to get rough. I didn't know if we were going to get out alive or
not.''
   Ms. Adams said Hatcher, angry and nervous ``almost to the point
of being hysterical,'' told his hostages that his life was in
jeopardy.
   ``He said he could not get anyone to listen to him. He said
Sheriff (Hubert) Stone had a contract out on him and he needed to
talk to the governor,'' she said.
   Bob Warren, an attorney for Jacobs, told the jurors the defense
would show ``how cocaine had corrupted law enforcement in the
county, how poor people without jobs were offered quick money to
sell cocaine under the protection of law enforcement.''

<HEAD>Human Rights Ruling on Health Care for People With AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by the city's Human Rights Commission
to force a dental clinic to pay $47,000 to two men it refused to
treat was a victory for those battling AIDS discrimination,
officials say.
   ``It is difficult to measure the kind of misery and suffering
that others inflict on people with AIDS,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch
said. ``There is no way to adequately describe the pain and
humiliation which discrimination adds to the disease.''
   Commission Chairman John E. Brandon said the commission found
Wednesday that Northern Dispensary, a Greenwich Village clinic,
violated the city's human rights law when it refused treatment to
two longtime patients. One has AIDS and the other has tested
positive for the AIDS antibody.
   ``This case is an important step forward in preserving the
rights and dignity of all people,'' he said.
   The commission also ordered the health facility to post a notice
that it does not discriminate against disabled persons, including
those with AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   A message for comment left at the clinic was not returned.
   One of the patients, George Whitmore, a free-lance writer, said
he had told a dentist at the dispensary in 1986 to be careful not
to cut his gums while cleaning his teeth because ``when the immune
system is low it takes a long time to heal.''
   He said it was then that he told the dentist he had AIDS.
   ``He continued to clean my teeth, then stopped, talked to
another dentist and the administrator came over and said it was not
their policy to treat people with AIDS,'' he said.
   ``I was very angry,'' he said. ``I was really outraged.''
   Brandon said with infection control techniques already in place
at the dispensary, the men posed no threat of contagion to dentists.
   He said Northern Dispensary claimed it was justified in refusing
to treat the patients for legitimate medical and financial reasons
and thereby did not engage in discriminatory conduct.
   AIDS is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old man was slashed across the ear with
a straight razor after he came to the aid of a pickpocket victim on
a subway train.
   Dennis Eagan was listed in good condition at Northwestern
Memorial Hospital after surgeons reconstructed his ear, which had
been deeply cut in the incident Wednesday. There have been no
arrests.
   The attack was the lastest in a series of violent incidents on
public transportation. Two people have been killed and a woman
raped on or near Chicago Transit Authority facilities in the last
two weeks.
   Eagan said he spotted a man putting his hand in the purse of a
woman boarding the train and banged on the train window to warn
her. The man stopped for a minute, then began putting his hand in
the woman's purse again, he said. ``I guess I embarrassed him in
front of the others in the car,'' said Eagan, a service
representative for an air freight company. ``I said `Why do you
have to steal? Why don't you get a job and work?' ... He said, `I'm
going to get you.'''
   Eagan said the man whispered to a companion, then ``the second
guy grabs me and holds me while the first guy pulls a big straight
razor and takes a swing and misses. He tries again and I jerk away,
but he got my ear.''
   Two men came to his aid in pushing off the attackers, Eagan
said. The assailants fled.
   The woman whose purse was being picked ``kept thanking me and
thanking me, but I was thinking about my ear,'' said Eagan.
   Meanwhile, Curtis Sliwa, founder of the New York-based Guardian
Angels civilian patrol group, said he would come to Chicago to help
fight violence on the CTA.
   The Angels' current Chicago contingent of 30 part-timers asked
for reinforcements, Sliwa said. He said he and eight others would
come from New York to help patrol CTA trains.

   A tony shopping mall has given a 72-year-old

   ``It was purely a business decision,'' said Warren Chaumont,
marketing director for Lenox Square, the Atlanta area's best-known
shopping mall.
   ``Having an organ grinder in the middle of the center was not in
keeping with the caliber of stores. They pay a lot of money to be
here, and we want to protect the upscale image,'' he said Wednesday.
   Organ grinder Sam Ketcham, who had worked at the center since it
opened in 1959, was told July 19 that he is no longer welcome in
the mall, which includes such stores as Brooks Brothers,
Neiman-Marcus and Macy's.
   ``I couldn't get over it,'' said Ketcham, who now sporadically
works nearby county fairs.
   ``We've been getting calls, asking when we're going to be back.
I don't know what to tell them,'' he said.
   ``I remember people being crazy about these monkeys,'' he added.
``But now I guess they're just a novelty of past generations.''

   Lloyd Bentsen told Tennessee
schoolchildren today a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would make
the United States the leader in space exploration again, and he
called on them to consider becoming ``part of this new generation
of space pioneers.''
   Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke to the
students while waiting with them to watch the scheduled launch of
the space shuttle Discovery on television.
   The launch ``marks a new beginning in our space program,'' the
Texas senator told the middle school students. ``It is a good
beginning but there are more challenges ahead of us.''
   Bentsen told the students that Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis was committed to the shuttle program and to a
permanently manned U.S. space station. Dukakis has promised to
revive a Cabinet-level space council and put Bentsen in charge of
it.
   ``When Mike Dukakis and I are elected president and vice
president of the United States, we will make sure that America's
space program is first rate. We will work to regain leadership in
the race to new frontiers. We will commit America to a program of
exploration and adventure second to none,'' Bentsen said.
   That program, he said, would depend on a new generation of
scientists and explorers, and he challenged the students to
dedicate themselves to studying math and science.
   ``Machines can go into space, but only men and women explore
space, probing for its secrets and reaching for the stars,''
Bentsen said.
   From Tennessee, Bentsen was heading home to Texas, where he was
to join Dukakis for a Democratic Party fund-raiser.
   At appearances Wednesday night in Nashville, Bentsen said that
if the Republicans win the election, a George Bush administration
would endanger Social Security and provide inadequate ethical
safeguards.
   Bentsen promised that he and Dukakis would ``never, no never,
turn our backs on kickbacks'' to defense contractors and
consultants, a reference to the Pentagon procurement scandal now
unraveling in the nation's capital.
   Also, as Dukakis has recently, Bentsen said Bush might tap the
Social Security trust fund to help balance the federal budget
deficit and recalled Bush's 1985 vote against cost-of-living
adjustments to Social Security recipients.
   ``In Social Security, in whom do you want to put your trust?''
Bentsen said at the second Nashville fund-raiser. Then, turning a
favorite Bush line, Bentsen said: ``My friends, don't just read
their lips, watch what they do.''
   Bentsen said Dukakis had a proven record as a fiscal manager and
challenged Republicans on their use of the nickname
``Taxachusetts'' to describe the Massachusetts governor's home
state.
   ``When they talk about `Taxachusetts,' ask them the date they
called it `Taxachusetts,''' Bentsen said. The nickname was pinned
on the state in the 1970s, when its tax burden was among the
nation's highest. The tax burden now ranks 34th among the 50 states.
   ``It's the difference between an eight-year photo opportunity
and a country on the move again,'' Bentsen said of the stakes of
the November election.
   Dukakis campaign aides in Tennessee said they have not done any
recent polls but that they believe they are trailing Bush by a few
points.
   Former presidential candidate Albert Gore Jr. worked the
fund-raising crowd in an effort to whip up support for Dukakis and
Bentsen, urging his former supporters to work for the Democratic
ticket.
   The Tennessee senator said Bentsen was prepared to step in as
president while Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle
was not. ``America's values and America's future might well be at
stake,'' Gore said.
   That line of attack was similar to one used by Bentsen earlier
Wednesday in Missouri, where he visited the birthplace of Harry
Truman to promise an active vice presidency and question both
Quayle's qualifications and Bush's judgment in selecting the
41-year-old Indiana senator.
   ``If they were elected, I'd pray for the good health of George
Bush every night,'' Bentsen said, painting Quayle as a member of
the far-right ``out of the mainstream of where the American people
find their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations.''

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis suffered a motorist's nightmare today, a flat tire on the
busy New Jersey Turnpike.
   But, unlike most motorists, when the right front tire of his
limousine went flat Dukakis had a backup car to move into.
   The presidential nominee was traveling in a motorcade from New
York, where he spent the night, to New Brunswick to deliver an
environmental speech at Rutgers University.
   No one was injured and the limo was left at the side of the
turnpike.

<HEAD>Peacekeepers Celebrate Nobel Prize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. peacekeepers today radioed word of their
Nobel Peace Prize victory to battalions in battle-scarred Lebanon
and cracked open bottles of champagne in Jerusalem to celebrate the
prestigious award.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar paid tribute to
the peacekeeping forces worldwide after the Nobel Committee
announced they will receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Spokesmen said the prize would give a boost to U.N. efforts to
contain global conflicts.
   U.N. officials in Finland, which contributes more peacekeeping
troops than any other country, said they hoped the prize would
induce members to pay their bills for the financially ailing forces.
   ``The recent achievements of the United Nations have neither
been sudden nor fortuitous, but are the hard-won results of
persistence and dedication over many years, epitomized by the
peacekeeping activities of the Organizations,'' Perez de Cuellar
told the delegates to the 43rd General Assembly.
   ``The awarding of the prize to the peacekeepers is obviously a
token of world appreciation for the work of the force,'' said Capt.
Mikael Heinrichs, senior officer in the Defense Ministry's U.N.
office in Finland. ``I am sure that it will help with finding
enough international will to help finance the force.''
   ``The international community has finally given appropriate
recognition to all the sacrifices our people have made,'' Timor
Goksel, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon,
told The Associated Press.
   ``There is great joy. This came as a pleasant surprise,'' Goksel
said in a telephone interview from Naqoura, Lebanon.
   ``We just got the news,'' Lt. Col. Gerry McMahon, 52, of
Newbridge, Ireland, told the AP by telephone. ``We are sending it
by radio to various battaltions. It's the fastest way to get it out
to everyone.''
   McMahon, a senior operations officer, said the peacekeepers
often felt their job was a thankless one ``but we get used to that
after a few years. It may not make world headlines, but every day
you have a small achievement on the ground.''
   Goksel said 100,000 men and women from 15 countries have served
in UNIFIL ``under very difficult circumstances'' since it was
formed in 1978. Of those, 156 troops have been killed, 230 were
wounded in action and two are missing, he said.
   In Jerusalem, Tony French, a spokesman for the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization, said: ``Any acclamation and recognition
of the U.N.'s valuable role helps to assist the U.N. in
peacekeeping and as a world forum for peace.''
   ``U.N. forces have labored a long time under great difficulties
in the cause of peace,'' French told The AP.
   Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset, chief of staff of the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization, added,``We have, so to speak, lived
through all the wars you can think of, and one might say that we
have been unsuccessful in not preventing them. I Think we have been
successful in being available to try to minimize disaster when it
first broke out``
   ``We are, of course, very, very glad to receive the Nobel Peace
Prize. It's absolutely a most rewarding day, if I may say so.``

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reduces Model's Acne Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appellate court has reduced a $2 million
judgment won by a model who claimed that her face was scarred by
acne caused by cosmetics.
   In a decision issued Tuesday, the court gave Teresa Norris, who
had a contract with the Wilhemina modeling agency, the option of
accepting a reduced sum of $400,000 or going through another trial.
   Miss Norris, now 28 and living in Paradise, Calif., bought $147
worth of beauty products from an Erno Laszlo cosmetic seller in a
Utah department store in 1981 after the employee told her she had
oily skin.
   After eight months and an additional $250 in Laszlo products,
Miss Norris' complexion was ``destroyed by deep-pitted scars and
ice-pick-type marks,'' attorney David Jaroslawicz charged in the
model's damage suit.
   During the March 1987 trial in Manhattan, Miss Norris testified
that she became depressed. ``I stayed home alone. I cried a lot,''
she said. She stopped working, her marriage broke up and she lost
her sexual drive, she said during the trial.
   Cosmetic experts backed her claims and testified that the Laszlo
products had ingredients in them that caused acne. The formula was
changed in 1982.
   Laszlo attorney Frank Ameroso argued that Miss Norris had oily
skin and acne before she ever used Laszlo products. He said her
only pain and suffering was depression caused by her acne and that
any lost income could not be accurately projected.
   The jury had awarded Miss Norris $1 million for lost income and
$1 million for pain and suffering. In its four-paragraph decision
reducing the award, the three-judge appellate panel said both sums
were excessive.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, with actor
and environmentalist Robert Redford at his side, took aim today at
the Reagan administration's environmental record and promised a
toxic waste site cleanup within eight years.
   As for his Republican opponent in the presidential race, Dukakis
said, ``Calling George Bush an environmentalist is like calling Dan
Quayle a statesman.''
   In a speech prepared for delivery at Rutgers University, Dukakis
cited Bush's role as chairman of the Regulatory Relief Task Force
and blamed the vice president for blocking regulations to reduce
lead in the air as well as a plan to control toxic wastes.
   An active environmentalist and Dukakis supporter, Redford joined
the Democratic nominee on the platform at Rutgers.
   Dukakis received the endorsement of the League of Conservation
Voters, Environmental Action, Friends of the Earth and Clean Water
Action.
   ``Mr. Bush's administration has had eight years to clean up
toxic wastes,'' said Dukakis. ``They've started the cleanup on only
137 sites on the National Priorities List out of a total of 1,200.''
   He said that in his administration ``cleanup will be completed
or well under way at every single one of the nearly 1,200 Superfund
sites on the National Priorities List by December 1996.''
   Companies responsible for pollution that want to help in the
cleanup would get government assistance, he said, adding, ``For the
foot-draggers and the chronic polluters I have just one message:
you better vote for Mr. Bush because if I'm elected the game is
over.''
   He also vowed to collect ``every dime we can of the more than
$700 million in cleanup costs that haven't been paid by the
polluters.''
   While blasting the Republican administration's record on the
environment, Dukakis remained defensive about the pollution in his
own back yard.
   ``Let me say a word about my favorite harbor,'' said Dukakis. He
called Boston Harbor the oldest in America and said, ``People
started throwing things into it more than a century before the
Boston Tea Party. And Mr. Bush doesn't know what he's talking about
because we're cleaning up Boston Harbor. And we've had to fight Mr.
Bush and the administration he belongs to every inch of the way.''
   On Wednesday, Dukakis met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, who denied he or his government tilted toward the
Republicans in the presidential race. ``It's up to the American
people to elect a president,'' he said. ``That's the main thing.''
   After meeting with Shevardnadze, Dukakis met with West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. They posed for pictures
but did not discuss their conversation.
   All the foreign officials were in New York for the opening of
the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.
   Shevardnadze met Friday with Bush, and the vice president was
quick to point out: ``It is a pleasure for me to see Mr.
Shevardnadze again. We have met several times.''
   For his part, the Soviet official acted pleased to confirm
Bush's claim and then some.
   ``This is not our first meeting,'' he said. ``He (Bush) has been
involved in all high-level discussions here in Washington and (in)
our talks with the president.''
   For Bush it was a nice political boost, confirmation from the
Soviet officials that the vice president had been more than just an
onlooker in administration discussions with the other superpower.
   Dukakis could make no comparable claim.
   But Shevardnadze did his best to give Dukakis a measure of
equality. He described his discussion with the Massachusetts
governor as ``very interesting, constructive and profound.''
   He had called his talk with Bush ``a very interesting, a very
substantive and a very profound discussion.''
   The recent signing of an arms control treaty and the general
signs of improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations left Dukakis with
little choice but to tip his hat to Reagan.
   ``I made it clear to the foreign minister that I was not here to
negotiate or discuss specific proposals,'' said the Democratic
presidential nominee. ``We have one president and I support
President Reagan's effort to move forward on these issues right up
to the end of his term in office. ... I intend to build on the work
that President Reagan has begun.''
   Shevardnadze welcomed Dukakis' reference to continuity.
   ``He spoke in support of continuity and consistency, having in
mind support for the recent positive trends in Soviet-American
relations. This is very important,'' said the Soviet foreign
minister.
   While Dukakis was willing to give Reagan credit for the warming
in superpower relations, he hammered away at the administration on
ethics and the economy.
   ``In a Dukakis administration, we're not going to turn the White
House into a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents,'' he told
a rally in Greensburg, Pa.
   Dukakis said that on his first day as president he would sign an
executive order barring top administration officials who leave his
administration from lobbying government agencies for the duration
of his administration. Current law prohibits them from lobbying
their former agencies for one year after leaving officce.
   Dukakis also ridiculed Bush's proposal for establishment of
individual savings accounts, a plan Dukakis said would save middle
class taxpayers ``20 bucks a year.''
   At the same, he said Bush's plan to cut capital gains taxes
would give the wealthiest Americans a $30,000 annual tax break.
   ``George Bush plays Santa Claus to the wealthy and Ebenezer
Scrooge to the rest of us,'' said Dukakis.

<TEXT>
   Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, taking his
case for legalizing drug possession to Congress, said today that
making illicit drugs available legally would help, not hurt, the
United States.
   Schmoke told a House committee that the United States has tried
vigorously for 75 years to rid itself of the what he described as
the reality that drug prohibition increases crime without doing
away with addiction.
   ``Nevertheless, that reality remains as true today as ever,'' he
told the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.
``We have spent nearly 75 years and untold billions of dollars
trying to square the circle, and inevitably we have failed.''
   Instead of a drug policy based primarily on law enforcement,
Schmoke proposed ``a measured and carefully implemented program of
drug decriminalization,'' similar to the repeal of the 1920s'
prohibition on alcohol.
   He conceded that there were risks in what he was suggesting.
   ``Providing legal access to currently illicit substances carries
with it the chance, although by no means the certainty, that the
number of people using and abusing drugs will increase.
   ``But addiction, for all of its attendant medical, social and
moral problems, is but one evil associated with drugs. Moreover,
the criminalization of narcotics, cocaine and marijuana has not
solved the problem of their use.''
   Opening the hearing, the committee chairman, Rep. Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y., who has opposed Schmoke's proposal, said the United
States now spends $140 billion a year on illicit drugs and absorbs
another $100 billion a year in lost productivity and drug-related
crime.
   ``I am not ready to spend more of the American people's money on
drugs and crime and property loss, which is what would happen under
legalization,'' he said.
   ``I am concerned about the impact of drugs on the future of this
country,'' Rangel said. ``But, unlike some of those who have grown
weary of this crisis, I am in no way ready to give up and say that
we have fought the fight and have lost the war on drugs.''
   The chance of congressional approval of drug legalization is nil.
   Mayors Ed Koch of New York City, Marion Barry of the District of
Columbia, Dennis Callahan of Annapolis, Md., and Carrie Saxon Perry
of Hartford, Conn., were among 32 other witnesses scheduled to
testify at the hearing.
   Others on the agenda include John Lawn, administrator of the
Drug Enforcement Administration; Arthur C. Eads, board chairman of
the National District Attorneys Association, and Jerald Vaughn,
executive director of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police.
   Rangel said he called the hearing to seek answers to such
questions as:
   _What would the United States do about international treaties it
has signed to stop the flow of drugs?
   _Who is responsible if a doctor or pharmacist provides drugs
which lead to an overdose?
   _How could legalization be squared with the nation's anti-drug
education programs?
   _What would happen to health insurance rates?
   _What would be the impact on minority communities already
ravaged by drug abuse?

   The Soviet Union called extraordinary meetings of
its legislature and of the policy-making Central Committee, and a
source said today that a shake-up in the party hierarchy is likely
in line with Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   The convening of the 300-member Central Committee on Friday and
of the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet on Saturday brought officials
rushing back to the capital.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arrived in Moscow this
afternoon after cutting short his visit to the United Nations, the
official Tass news agency announced. Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov ended a visit to India a day ahead of schedule.
   The Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, usually convenes
twice a year after meetings of the Central Committee. It last
convened May 24-26. Soviet media reported Sunday that a regular
session of the Supreme Soviet would begin Oct. 27, and the
announcement of a special sitting at such short notice indicated
urgent government business.
   The Central Committee had been expected to meet by the end of
October, but the source said reform plans were proceeding ``faster
than was expected.''
   The source, who is a member of the Central Committee staff, said
the committee will approve reforms in the party and government
structure outlined at a Communist Party conference in June. The
reforms are intended to enhance the party's status as the leading
force in Soviet society.
   He added that it's ``logical'' that personnel changes will
follow any alterations in the organizations' format.
   The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Echoing an announcement by Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov in New York on Wednesday, the source said the
meeting would ``take new steps in implementing political reform,''
based on the decisions of the party conference.
   Meetings of the 300-member Central Committee, although rarely
announced in advance, are generally scheduled well ahead of time
and do not require top officials to curtail other commitments.
   At its last meeting, on July 29, the Central Committee adopted a
timetable for overhauling the Soviet political system, which also
was discussed at the party conference.
   The first deadline set was October, by which time the Central
Committee said a draft law on amendments to the Soviet Constitution
and on multi-candidate elections of legislators was to be complete.
In a speech Friday, Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, said the
Politburo soon would convene to review the draft law.
   But comments by Gerasimov and the Central Committee source put
the focus on changes in the Communist Party structure. Gorbachev
could be seeking to strengthen his hand in the Central Committee to
push through the political reforms.
   Soviet sources said today there was ``no crisis'' in the
leadership. A well-placed Soviet journalist said he expected no
``sensation'' from the plenum.
   Soviet sources also reported speculation among high-placed
officials about whether there would be changes on the Politburo
itself, indicating uncertainty even at high levels about the agenda.
   The Central Committee is empowered to make personnel changes in
the Politburo.
   The last full Politburo member removed was Geidar A. Aliev on
Oct. 21, 1987. Aliev was a close protege of former President Leonid
I. Brezhnev, who now is harshly criticized for permitting
corruption and stagnation.
   Official Soviet newspapers today carried nothing about the
meeting, but the Tass news agency and English-language broadcasts
of official Radio Moscow reported that Shevardnadze was curtailing
his visit and returning home for the Central Committee meeting.
   The conference of 5,000 Communist Party officials held in Moscow
at the end of June and beginning of July approved plans to limit
terms of Communist Party officials and a review of the entire
20-million party membership.
   There also has been speculation that Gorbachev's backers want to
remove 60 60 to 70 ``dead souls'' from the Central Committee. They
are party leaders elected to the committee shortly after Gorbachev
took power in March 1985, but since then have lost the party or
government jobs that entitled them to committee membership.
   Gorbachev has criticized the party apparatus for being too
involved in the day-to-day operation of the government and the
economy, and has argued that reforms must focus party work on
establishing broad policies and theories.
   Personnel changes could give Gorbachev and his backers a chance
to move out conservative party bureaucrats that they see blocking
the Soviet leader's reforms.
   In a speech in Moscow on Wednesday, Gorbachev once more called
for radical changes in Soviet society.
   ``Any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity
of radical change. It is needed in the party, in the state, in
agriculture, in industry, in personnel policy and most of all in
people's mentality, in their attitudes to work, to one another and
to themselves,'' Gorbachev said at a Kremlin dinner honoring
visiting East German leader Erich Honecker.

<HEAD>Talks Over Blood Test Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer will ask a judge to decide how a
blood sample will be taken from a 9-year-old girl to help determine
if she was switched with another as an infant in a hospital nursery.
   Marvin Ellin, a lawyer representing a Pennsylvania couple who
think the Sarasota girl may be theirs, said he wanted the
sophisticated blood testing done by Johns Hopkins University
technicians and the results made public, two conditions rejected by
the girl's attorney.
   He said he would file a court petition Monday.
   Dale Swope, who represents the girl's father, said Wednesday his
client will seek genetic tests on his own _ under a cloak of
secrecy.
   In a statement, he said, ``If it produces unsettling results,
they will be kept confidential until our client has had a chance to
explain this tragedy to his child. Then, in time, after she has
adjusted to it, we will disclose it to other interested parties.''
   The tests of blood samples identify genetic links between parent
and child.
   Neither side has released the names of the father or girl
involved.
   Regina and Ernest Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., have claimed in a
$100 million lawsuit that three doctors and a nurse at tiny Hardee
Memorial Hospital in Wauchula switched their healthy baby girl with
an infant that was suffering from a congenital heart defect.
   The couple nursed the sick girl, Arlena Twigg, until she died
recently. Tests taken before a heart operation at a New Jersey
hospital indicated Arlena's blood type was different from theirs.
Further sophisticated tests ruled out any biological relationship.
   Birth records on file with the state show only one white girl,
the Sarasota child, shared the nursery with the Twigg baby.

   A man was charged in the killing of an
up-and-coming drug gang leader, a slaying that sparked a rampage by
up to 200 youths who flipped and burned cars and torched and looted
a store, authorities said.
   Several of the youths fired shots into the air, but no one was
injured or arrested in Tuesday night's rampage, police said.
   The mayhem came in retaliation for late Monday's killing of Luis
Antonio Ortiz, 20, whom Police Commissioner Willie Williams
described Wednesday as an emerging drug gang leader. Authorities
said the death came after a member of a rival gang was fatally
injured on a motorcycle he had bought from Ortiz.
   Wednesday morning, Andres Albaladejo, 33, surrendered and was
charged with murder and weapons offenses in connection with Ortiz's
death, police said.
   Ortiz's pickup truck was adorned Wednesday with funeral wreaths
and candles.
   ``I was very upset that we still live in an era when the death
of a drug dealer who peddles death, a man who is accused of a
homicide himself, but not convicted, was being made a hero ... in a
neighborhood where drugs are taking more lives than perhaps
anything else,'' Williams said at a news conference.
   ``It indicates that we and the community have a lot of work to
do to correct this.''
   Williams said police would increase patrols in the poor Hunting
Park neighborhood through the weekend.
   Wednesday night and this morning, an ``uneasy calm'' rested over
the neighborhood, Bennie Swans, the city's Crisis Intervention
Network director, said today.
   Swans met with representatives of the two groups Wednesday night
_ Ortiz's OK Corral gang and the rival Gray Tape gang. He said he
is confident ``that the community is continuing to place enough
pressure on the two groups to cool out.''
   Swans said a Gray Tape gang member, Richie Colon, 18, died
Monday from injuries suffered Saturday when he crashed a motorcycle
he had bought from Ortiz. Swans wouldn't comment on published
reports quoting unidentified neighborhood residents as saying the
motorcycle had bad brakes.
   The first signs of trouble came hours after Ortiz's death, when
youths looted and burned a grocery store owned by a brother of
Albaladejo. Williams said the department was investigating reports
that police stayed away from the store even though they knew of the
looting.
   The trouble brewed through the early morning hours Tuesday, and
firefighters were called to the store a second time when another
fire was set, Williams said.
   The melee broke out in full Tuesday evening, when about 20 or 30
men flipped and set afire two cars that police have been told were
owned by relatives of Albaladejo.
   About an hour later, when an officer responded to an unfounded
call about a burglary, an empty beer bottle was thrown through the
rear window of his cruiser, Williams said.
   For five hours, up to 200 people milled around the neighborhood,
some drinking, some firing shots into the air, Williams said.
   During the riot, uniformed police pulled out and plainclothes
negotiators went in to talk with community leaders and restored
calm.
   In January 1987, Ortiz posted $100,000 bail after being charged
with murder, Williams said. In March, he was arrested for
possession with intent to deliver drugs and freed on $3,500 bail.
   More than 60 people were killed in drug-related violence this
summer in Philadelphia, including a 5-year-old boy whose death
triggered a wave of anti-drug protests.

<TEXT>
   The last time Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle
debated on television, it wasn't exactly a national media event.
But now the two are rival vice presidential candidates and their
performances next week could influence this year's presidential
election.
   Even as argument continues over who won the debate between
George Bush and Michael Dukakis, the two campaigns are priming
their running mates for next Wednesday's scrap in Omaha, Neb.
They're also trying to move public opinion to receive their
candidates favorably.
   Quayle returned to Washington on Wednesday night to begin
cramming for the 90-minute battle. Bentsen planned to finish his
latest campaign trip on Friday in Washington, and then go to back
to his native Texas on Sunday for final preparations.
   They're both reading briefing books, reviewing video tapes,
huddling with top staff and getting tips on talking to the cameras.
   Although the two men disagree over many policies, the main issue
at stake in the debate is Quayle, who the Democrats contend is not
qualified to be next in line to the oval office.
   Dukakis has said ``the notion of `President Quayle' is a very,
very troubling notion.''
   ``I'll tell you, if they were elected, I'd pray for the good
health of George Bush every night,'' Bentsen said Wednesday, trying
to persuade voters who are leaning toward Bush that they can't risk
Quayle.
   Bush defends his choice, saying in Sunday's debate: ``I see a
man who is young and I'm putting my confidence in a whole
generation of people that are in their thirties and their forties.''
   Republicans are more than happy to downplay Quayle's chances of
surviving a debate with Bentsen.
   ``I don't think there's a lot of pressure on Sen. Quayle because
frankly a lot of people have gotten out there and gotten his
expectations so low that I don't think they could be much lower,''
said James Baker, Bush's campaign chief.
   ``We'll be ready for the debate,'' Quayle told reporters.
   Rich Bond, Bush's deputy campaign manager and political
director, said he expects the candidates will not ``concentrate
their fire at each other but at the top of the ticket.''
   ``Quayle will probably ask Bentsen to join him in debating
Dukakis because they have so much in common,'' he said.
   Bentsen ``can't really debate Quayle on the issues. He has to
defend Quayle's position because most of them are his own. I think
he will squirm,'' said Sheila Tate, Bush's spokeswoman.
   Joseph O'Neill, Bentsen's campaign director, said Quayle's
record will matter as the Democrats try to show ``that our team is
better than their team.'' The Dukakis campaign contends that
Bentsen's differences with Dukakis show that Dukakis didn't want a
``clone'' for a running mate.
   The low expectations for Quayle have worried the Dukakis
campaign, because if they're too low Quayle could win simply by
surviving the debate without any major gaffes. So, alongside a
continual knocking of Quayle, the Democrats are trying to portray
him as an able debater with years of practice in the Senate.
   Privately, Bentsen's aides say they're worried Bentsen, 67, will
look and sound old compared with the 41-year-old Quayle. The
Republicans at least imply the same thing.
   ``The contrast between Quayle and Bentsen is going to be
great,'' said Tate. ``Quayle represents the new generation of
leadership, he's bright and engaging.''
   The Bentsen campaign, trying to refute the expectations
imbalance, points to the April 22 broadcast of public television's
MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour, during which Bentsen and Quayle debated
the issue of giving workers 60 days' notice before a plant could be
closed. Quayle eventually lost the battle on the Senate floor, but
on television he presented his case attractively.
   The Bush campaign reviewed that videotape before picking Quayle
as Bentsen's adversary. Roger Ailes, the Bush campaign's top media
adviser, watched that tape and will be coaching Quayle.
   Bentsen traveled this week with his briefing books and with
extra staff from the Dukakis campaign, carving out time from his
schedule to watch tapes of Quayle, including his 1980 debates with
Sen. Birch Bayh, whom he defeated to first win election to the
Senate.
   That work will be expanded on the weekend in Washington and then
in Austin, Texas, where Bentsen will travel Sunday and work until
Tuesday when he goes to Omaha. Democratic Rep. Dennis Eckart of
Ohio plans to play Quayle for Bentsen's preparation.
   Quayle is receiving issues briefings from Republican staff of
the Senate and from GOP experts such as Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
   In mock debates, Quayle is using Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., a
long-time colleague of Bentsen's on the Senate Finance Committee.

   The Nobel Committee today awarded the 1988
Nobel Peace Prize to the blue-bereted U.N. peacekeeping forces
patrolling the front lines of the world's trouble spots.
   The committee cited the troops for building a confidence in the
United Nations that allows it to play a growing role in global
affairs, and for reducing warfare.
   ``There is great joy,'' said Timor Goksel, spokesman for the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. ``The international community has
finally given appropriate recognition to all the sacrifices our
people have made,'' he told The Associated Press in Jerusalem in a
telephone interview from Naqoura, Lebanon.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said ``the Nobel
Committee recognizes that the quest for peace is a universal
undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world.''
   Committee chairman Egil Aarvik said President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been ``seriously considered'' for
the prize.
   He did not explain the committee's decision but indicated the
presidential election may have been a factor. ``Everything was
taken into consideration,'' he said.
   Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from more than 30 countries serve
under the U.N. flag from the Middle East to the Indian
subcontinent. Peacekeepers most recently were dispatched to Iran
and Iraq under a cease-fire negotiated in the countries'
8-year-long war.
   The decision was widely regarded as an indirect award to Perez
de Cuellar, who scored diplomatic breakthroughs this year in
mediating the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, a Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan and progress in talks on southwest Africa.
   Perez de Cuellar was ineligible for this year's prize because he
was nominated after the Feb. 1 deadline.
   Aarvik told reporters he hoped the award would ``give the U.N.
and the forces increased prestige.''
   The image of the United Nations has recently been enhanced by
its role in the recent cease-fires and peace talks, although it
suffers financial problems. However, the United States has said it
will pay $188 million of the money it owes the world body.
   U.N. peacekeepers radioed word of their shared victory to
battalions in battle-scarred Lebanon and cracked open bottles of
champagne in Jerusalem to celebrate.
   The five-member committee praised the forces in Lebanon,
Afghanistan, Syria, Cyprus, the subcontinent and Iran and Iraq for
subduing tensions where armistices have substituted for peace.
   The citation said the peacekeepers ``have played a significant
role in reducing the level of conflict even though the fundamental
causes of the struggles frequently remain.''
   U.N. peacekeeping officials in Finland, which contributes more
troops than any other country, said they hoped the Nobel Peace
Prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially
ailing forces.
   The United Nations is in arrears in payments to countries which
provide soldiers for the peacekeeping forces. It owes Finland $22.5
million.
   It was the fifth time that a U.N.-related body won the coveted
prize since it was first awarded in 1901 from the estate of Alfred
Nobel, the inventor of dynamite.
   It was the 16th time that an organization rather than a person
was named the Peace Prize laureate.
   Aarvik said he expected Perez de Cuellar to come to Oslo to
accept the award at the annual ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary
of Nobel's death in 1896. Nobel built a fortune from his invention
and marketing of explosives.
   The first U.N. troops were sent to monitor the armistice between
Israel and the Arab states in 1948. Today, most U.N. forces are
stationed in the Middle East.
   The committee singled out the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon,
which has suffered more than 200 casualties since it was sent to
Lebanon's southern border region with Israel in 1978.
   Pvt. Mike Mahony, 26, of Cork, Ireland, said he hoped the award
would make their job easier in Lebanon. ``I feel proud. I suppose
we'll get more respect now,'' Mahony said in a telephone interview.
   U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who headed a 76-member
U.N. observer group in south Lebanon attached to UNIFIL, is one of
nine American hostages in Lebanon. Higgins, 43, was seized Feb. 17.
   His pro-Iranian kidnappers, the underground Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, said April 21 that he was to be tried on
charges of spying for the United States. The United States and the
United Nations have denied the spying charge.
   The peace prize is the first this year to be announced of the
six annual Nobel Prizes. The others for literature, medicine,
chemistry, physics and economics will be announced next month in
Stockholm, the Swedish capital.
   Each prize carries a cash award of 2.5 million Swedish kronor,
or $390,000 at today's rate. It is divided among the winners if
there is more than one.

   A judge has offered men arrested for
propositioning an undercover police officer a break in their
sentences, providing they attend a class on romance.
   So far, 17 of the 61 men arrested on promoting prostitution
charges have accepted. Rochester City Court Judge Herman J. Walz
said the program is available only to first offenders.
   Others arrested in the Labor Day weekend roundup will be offered
the seminars during a court session today.
   The program is run by a neighborhood association and also
includes a sentence of two weekends in the Monroe County sheriff
department's work program. The men will cut weeds and pick up
litter on county highways.
   The 2{-hour seminars on sexual behavior will attempt to show the
men how their actions degrade the neighborhood, the judge said.
   The men will be asked to close their eyes and remember their
first kiss, an attempt to get them to associate sex with romance,
said William Sullivan, president of the neighborhood group.
   ``These guys are like every other man in the world,'' said
Sullivan, a professor of religious studies at St. John Fisher
College. ``They are not villains. They are young guys, old guys,
blue-collar, white-collar. We're trying to deal with them as adult,
mature human beings.''

   The highest-ranking Soviet official to
defect to the United States collapsed during a speech and was in
fair condition at a hospital today.
   Arkady N. Shevchenko, who served as a undersecretary general at
the United Nations for the Soviet Union from 1973 to 1978, was
taken to St. Vincent's Medical Center after becoming ill Wednesday
night during a talk at the Florida Community College at
Jacksonville.
   Shevchenko, 57, author of the best-selling ``Breaking With
Moscow,'' was admitted to the hospital in critical condition with
intestinal bleeding, said Bob Arnold, a hospital spokesman. Doctors
worked on Shevchenko for three hours before he was moved to the
intensive care unit in fair condition, Arnold said.
   ``Now he's up, he's alert, he's in good spirits,'' the spokesman
said. Shevchenko will remain in the hospital for at least five days.
   Arnold said he has been told that Shevchenko has had problems
with an ulcer in the past. But it is not known, Arnold said,
whether the ulcer caused Shevchenko to collapse .
   Shevchenko's defection 10 years ago was hailed as a coup for
U.S. intelligence, which had employed the diplomat as a spy from
1976 to 1978. He became a U.S. citizen in February 1986.
   His scheduled one-hour presentation at the college ended
suddenly after about 50 minutes as Shevchenko tried to make it to
his seat to rest, one witness said.
   ``He cut it short, abruptly,'' said William Hamaker, president
of the National Interest Forum, a local education organization that
sponsored the lecture. ``He barely got back to his seat.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan is pleased with the latest
version of a Pentagon budget bill similar to one he vetoed last
month and plans to sign it quickly, a White House spokesman said
today.
   Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the $300 billion defense
authorization bill passed by Congress ``restores the defense
spending priorities requested'' by Reagan in a message accompanying
the president's veto of an earlier version on Aug. 3.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci earlier had given
congressional figures assurances that Reagan would sign the
revamped authorization bill, and Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, told his colleagues, ``This
bill will be signed.''
   The assurances were conveyed by Carlucci during a week of
closed-door talks with Nunn and other legislators, according to
Nunn.
   ``The president will approve this bill. That was made very clear
and definite,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee.
   Fitzwater said the bill ``eliminates the major objections to the
original bill. We consider this bill a significant victory for the
president's commitment to a strong defense.''
   The House voted 369-48 approval of the revised measure Wednesday
afternoon. Three hours later, the Senate passed it, 91-4.
   Overall, the measure authorizes the Pentagon to spend $300
billion in the fiscal year beginning Saturday, the same total as
was contained in the bill Reagan vetoed Aug. 3. That represents a
slight cut from this year's $301 billion defense budget.
   While the new measure contains the same reductions in Reagan's
proposed Star Wars budget as the original legislation, the earlier
bill's congressionally mandated restrictions on internal spending
in the Star Wars program were removed.
   The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars anti-missile
research program is formally known, would receive $4.1 billion in
the bill, compared to the $4.8 billion sought by Reagan and the
$3.9 billion authorized for this year.
   The Pentagon wanted to spend up to $330 million of the SDI money
on a space-based interceptor weapon, the first stage of an early
deployment SDI program. The previous Pentagon bill would have
restricted that to only $85 million, but the new measure removes
that limit.
   The new bill also removes a restriction on flight testing of
``depressed trajectory'' missiles, which fly relatively low instead
of into space as do other long-range atomic weapons. The United
States has none of the weapons under development and no plans for
testing, but the Soviets are believed to be developing the weapons.
   Money to pay for the programs authorized in the bill is part of
a separate Pentagon appropriation bill.
   The measures are the major unfinished items on the congressional
agenda as legislators try to wind up their work and quit for the
year.
   The new Pentagon bill also rewrote the complicated spending plan
for the MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles, two weapons at the heart
of a dispute over the future of America's land-based nuclear
missile force.
   The original bill proposed spending $250 million each for study
of Midgetman and a railroad-based version of the MX and provided
another $250 million to be used for either program next year by the
incoming president.
   The new bill provides $250 million for Midgetman and $600
million for the MX-on-rails program, but says no more than $250
million of the MX money can be spent before Feb. 15. The remaining
$350 million could be reallocated by whomever wins the presidency
Nov. 8.
   The bill also includes a 4.1 percent pay raise for the nation's
2.1 million uniformed military personnel.
   Other provisions:

<TEXT>
   MILITARY-DRUGS _ The bill includes $300 million to increase the
military's role in the anti-drug effort and orders the Pentagon to

   NAVY SHIPS _ The bill includes money for one more Trident
missile-firing submarine, a pair of Los Angeles-class attack subs,
the first of a new Seawolf class of attack subs, three destroyers,

<TEXT>
   Not long after William Schroeder died two
years ago after spending 21 months with an artificial heart, his
wife wondered if a little plaque could be erected somewhere in the
couple's hometown.
   The plaque could say something about the spirit of a man with an
extraordinary will to live and a willingness to help others do the
same.
   Later this fall, Margaret Schroeder will get her wish and more.
   On Nov. 13, she will help dedicate a 13.5-foot high, 4,000-pound
stainless-steel sculpture titled ``Gateway to the Heart.''
   ``I thought maybe someday there'd be something, but nothing like
this. It's really overwhelming,'' Mrs. Schroeder said recently.
   The memorial, which almost has been completed by Jasper sculptor
Bernard Hagedorn, will be unveiled at the new Bill Schroeder Sports
Complex south of the Jasper High School football stadium. The
complex includes softball and soccer fields.
   Hagedorm says his work is somewhat controversial, but so was
Schroeder's medical experiment.
   ``It wouldn't be fitting to just have a bronze statue of Bill
Schroeder,'' Hagedorn said.
   What he found more fitting is a sculpture with an arch that
represents not only the gateway to the sports complex but also the
gateway to Jasper. Hagedorn said the arch signifies Schroeder's
triumph when he returned to his hometown for its annual
Strassenfest in August 1985, a year before his death.
   ``This symbolizes what he did and what he accomplished, rather
than him as an individual,'' said Bob Hedinger, a former classmate
of Schroeder's at Jasper High. ``But it all blends together.''
   Schroeder's classmates, Jasper High's class of 1950, reunited to
visit Schroeder while he was ill in a Louisville, Ky., hospital,
and to raise money to defray his medical costs.
   They also have raised about $15,000 for the memorial, but more
is needed for landscaping and other details.
   Schroeder, who was 54 when he died, lived longer than any other
patient with an artifical heart _ 620 days.
   His death on Aug. 6, 1986, at Humana Hospital-Audubon in
Louisville was caused by a massive stroke, one of many he suffered
after receiving the Jarvik-7 heart on Nov. 23, 1984.
   ``There's a really wonderful love in this town,'' Mrs. Schroeder
said.
   ``Wherever he is,'' she said of her husband, ``he's happy.''

   Republican George Bush observed the
successful launch of the space shuttle Discovery today and told a
campaign rally, ``America is back in space.''
   The vice president had just completed a campaign speech when the
shuttle was launched. He returned to the platform to tell cheering
supporters in a town square rally, ``What a good day. We're back in
space.''
   Earlier, Bush sharpened his criticism of Democrat Michael
Dukakis' tax enforcement proposals, claiming a Democratic victory
in the fall would mean ``a government hand in every pocket and a
tax agent in every home.''
   Bush accused his rival of wanting to double the number of
Internal Revenue Service agents and told his audience, ``I'm not
for a program that would give the IRS more power than it already
has.''
   During a bus tour Wednesday of rural Illinois, the vice
president repeatedly accused Dukakis of seeking to give the IRS new
and unwarranted powers.
   No matter that the IRS is part of the executive branch of
government that Bush has served for most of the past two decades.
The vice president on Wednesday made the IRS a prime new campaign
target anyway.
   ``The IRS has many fine and dedicated individuals,'' Bush told a
rally in Ottawa, Ill. ``Even so ... it can be high-handed.
Sometimes it seems to treat innocent people as if they were
presumed guilty.''
   Specifically, Bush criticized Dukakis's proposals to beef up
enforcement of tax collections and for a college loan program that
would be paid back through income tax withholding.
   In a day of relatively light campaigning, Bush was to attend
rallies here and in two Michigan cities today: Mount Clemens and
Grand Rapids.
   Bush accused Dukakis, in his enforcement plan, of wanting to
``give the IRS even more power than it already has to go after the
people of America.''
   Said Bush: ``He wants to squeeze another $35 billion bucks out
of the taxpayer's pocket. And, even if it were possible, that would
mean the IRS would have to double the number of their employees to
a total of over 200,000 and that is the equivalent of 20 army
divisions.''
   ``I do not want to create an auditor army of IRS agents,'' Bush
told the Ottawa rally.
   ``Faced with that kind of threat, the American people will need
a conventional defense initiative to defend themselves against all
these IRS auditors.''
   The Dukakis campaign countered that Bush was overstating the
number of IRS agents under the Democrat's plan. A statement said
the plan calls for an average 6 percent annual growth in IRS
personnel, not a 100 percent increase.
   Bush vowed that, if elected, he would resurrect a so-called
``Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' previously advocated, without success
in Congress, by President Reagan.
   The proposed ``bill of rights'' would require the IRS to inform
taxpayers of what rights they have during audits, among other
features.
   Earlier, in a speech to students at Illinois State University at
Normal, Ill., Bush criticized a Dukakis student loan plan that
would call for repayment of the loan depending on an individual's
later earning powers. Loan installments would be automatically
added to tax withholding, under the Dukakis plan.
   ``We do not need to put the IRS on your tail for the rest of
your life,'' he said.
   Bush's bus tour in the company of country music singers Loretta
Lynn and Crystal Gayle took him through northern and central
Illinois.
   While on the bus, Bush and Ms. Lynn compared notes of the
hazards of appearing in public. Bush asked her if she had trouble
with hecklers and drunks.
   ``Are you kidding? I've had guns thrown up on the stage,'' Ms.
Lynn said.
   ``Was that a sign of respect?'' the vice president joked.

<HEAD>Du Pont Will Introduce Substitute for Ozone-Destroying CFCs in
1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. said today it will begin
commercial production in 1990 at Corpus Christi, Texas, of a
substitute refrigeration chemical for one of the major
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon compounds.
   The new compound is HCFC-134a, long has been considered by
industry as a potential substitute for CFC-12 used in auto air
conditioners, home and commercial refrigerators and freezers and
chillers for large building air conditioners.
   Though several other CFC substitutes have been announced by
chemical companies, this is the first for a market that Du Pont
says represents about 40 percent of the 330,000 tons of CFCs
consumed annually in the United States.
   Major nations agreed last year to cut production of important
ozone-destroying CFC compounds by 50 percent in 1998, and the
Environmental Protection Agency on Monday said it now believes
their use should be ended completely.
   Chlorine liberated from these compounds has been blamed by
scientists for depleting the ozone high in the atmosphere that
shields the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays.
   Since HCFC-134a contains no chlorine, it cannot destroy ozone in
the stratosphere when it breaks up, as CFC-12 does.
   DuPont, which has three small plants producing HCFC-134a for
research, said it would spend more than $25 million on the Corpus
Christi installation to make unspecified ``millions'' of pounds of
HCFC-134a annually.

   The jury in the handgun trial of syndicated
columnist Carl T. Rowan indicated today it is so far deadlocked on
a verdict.
   The 12-member panel, which has now reviewed the matter for more
than five hours over two days, sent District of Columbia Superior
Court Judge Arthur L. Burnett Sr. a note saying a unanimous verdict
has not yet been reached. Burnett directed the jury to resume
deliberations.
   Rowan, a longtime advocate of strict handgun control, was
charged with using an unregistered pistol and ammunition to wound
18-year-old Benjamin Smith of suburban Chevy Chase, Md., who had
taken an unauthorized swim in Rowan's pool.
   If convicted of both misdemeanor charges, the 63-year-old Rowan
could face up to two years in jail and a $2,000 fine.
   Rowan's attorneys built their case on a little-used legal
principle called ``entrapment by estoppel.'' The principle holds
that a person cannot be convicted if he is prosecuted for following
advice given him by a government official.
   Rowan has maintained that his son, Carl Jr., was rebuffed by
police officials when he attempted to register the weapon that was
used in the June 14 shooting.
   Rowan's son, a former FBI agent, testified that city police told
him he was exempt from the registration requirements because he was
a law enforcement officer, and that others in his family could have
access to the gun as well.
   ``He (Carl Jr.) was depending upon the competence and
intelligence of those people that the District of Columbia put
there (to advise citizens on gun registration),'' argued Raoul
Carroll, Rowan's attorney. ``He was entirely at the mercy of the
District of Columbia.''
   During his two-day trial, Rowan took the stand to say he
obtained the weapon in 1982 after receiving a series of death
threats from people purporting to be members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   Mindful of the charges of hypocrisy leveled at him because of
his strong anti-gun position, the columnist also said his son had
to persuade him to arm himself.
   ``I had never had a gun in this house,'' Rowan told the jury.
``We (Rowan and his son) got into a little hassle about how
sometimes you can let your idealism go so far that you get killed.''
   Rowan said his fears were compounded by frequent intrusions by
area teens who held late-night pool parties, usually with alcohol
and drugs, in his yard.
   Police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a
door at the rear of Rowan's home showed signs that someone had
tried to break in. One officer also testified that the police
investigation revealed Smith had been shot at close range just
outside Rowan's home.
   Rowan maintained that he shot Smith because he was afraid the
intruder was trying to enter the house. Smith said he was trying to
flee when Rowan shot him.

   A beaming President Reagan today took note of
the successful liftoff of the shuttle Discovery, telling a White
House Rose Garden audience that ``America is back in space.''
   Reagan had been scheduled to take part in a ceremony at 11:45
a.m. EDT honoring organizations, businesses and individuals for
outstanding volunteer efforts last year, but he delayed his arrival
to watch the launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla. on a television in
the Oval Office.
   Smiling broadly as he stood before the crowd gathered under
darkening skies, Reagan announced that the shuttle had blasted off
successfully.
   ``We're now looking forward to the successful completion of the
Discovery mission and the safe return of her crew,'' he said, ``
... and we ask God to bless this voyage.''
   As he left the gathering, Reagan was queried as to whether he
had been worried about the fate of the shuttle.
   ``I think I had my fingers crossed like everybody else,'' he
replied.

   An East German man and woman eluded a communist

West Berlin on Thursday, police said.
   West Berlin police said the pair started out from the western
bank of the Havel near the East German village of Nieder-Neuendorf.
They swam about 450 yards in the early morning darkness before
reaching the Heiligensee district in the northwestern part of West
Berlin.
   East German border guards in a patrol board used searchlights in
an attempt to track down the pair, police said in a statement
released to the news media.
   The couple's name was not released under West Berlin police
guidelines aimed at protecting relatives still in East Germany. The
man said he was 34 years old, and the woman is 20, police said.
   On Wednesday, East German border guards opened fire on two men
as they fled over the Berlin Wall from East Berlin to West Berlin.
Neither was injured.
   Nearly 330 people people have fled East Germany to West Berlin

<HEAD>Soviet Military Chief Challenges U.S. on Naval Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's military chief
Thursday proposed major troop reductions in Europe and challenged
the United States to discuss cutting naval and air forces.
   ``The transition from unpredictable zigzags in relations between
the United States and the Soviet Union to more normal and stable
relations is now under way,'' Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev said in
a prepared speech.
   ``It appears that a bridge has been erected into the future, to
the next U.S. administration,'' he said.
   Akhromeyev made a ground-breaking visit this summer to the
United States, where he toured an American warship and sat in the
cockpit of a B-1 bomber. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci later
toured Soviet installations.
   Akhromeyev spoke to scholars and reporters at an annual lecture
sponsored by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
in honor of the late Prime Minister Olof Palme. The institute is
funded mostly by the Swedish Parliament.
   He said the Reagan presidency ``was not easy for us.'' But he
praised progress on missile reductions and said the Soviets had now
destroyed 200 of their medium- and short-range rockets under an
agreement signed in December by President Reagan and Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The United States has destroyed 29 of its missiles so far.
   ``What causes concern are the oceans and seas,'' Akhromeyev said.
   ``The United States and some if its allies do not want to extend
verification of the confidence-building measures to the navies and
air forces where they have a superiority over the U.S.S.R.''
   He cited heavy warships, aircraft carriers, sea-based aircraft
and tactical strike aviation, as areas of Soviet disadvantage.
Warsaw Pact navies ``also possess substantial strike
capabilities,'' he acknowledged without going into detail.
   Akhromeyev laid out similar arguments in an article in the
Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda this month, and his speech
here seemed intended to step up pressure on the United States for
naval reduction talks.
   Akhromeyev promised Soviet openness in counting troops at new
talks in Vienna on reducing regular forces in Europe.
   The Vienna talks on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions in
Europe have dragged on with little progress for 15 years, mainly
because the opposing alliances do not trust each other's estimates
of how many soldiers they have.
   When a planned new format for the talks is set, ``we propose not
merely a data exchange, but also thorough verification, including
on-site inspections, at any time convenient for the parties after
the beginning of the talks,'' Akhromeyev said.
   Both alliances should reduce troops by 25 percent or a total of
500,000 men as a further step, he said. Other reductions should
follow ``to make the character of the armed forces of the alliances
generally defensive,'' he said.
   According to Western estimates, the Warsaw Pact holds a 3-to-1
advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2-to-1 edge in combat
aircraft and troops, including reserves in the Soviet Union.
   Western officials have expressed doubts about the Soviet
emphasis in public statements on defensive strategy.
   Carlucci, in Moscow in August, said he had ``difficulty in
reconciling'' Kremlin claims of a defensive strategy with its high
military spending and offensive weapons stocks.

<HEAD>Anti-Hirohito Group Marches; Monarch Receives Two More
Transfusions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito received blood transfusions for
the seventh straight day Thursday, and a citizen's group marched to
protest media portrayals that the entire nation sympathizes with
the ailing monarch.
   The 87-year-old Hirohito was given two transfusions Thursday, a
palace spokesman said, bringing to 7.7 pints the amount he has
received since internal hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood
Sept. 19.
   ``Fortunately, his majesty has been in stable condition, though
I as chief court physician am always attentive,'' Kenji Maeda was
quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying.
   Maeda said blood in the bedridden monarch's bowel discharge
Thursday morning prompted the first transfusion.
   ``I understand the symptom of continuing jaundice is still
present,'' Maeda said.
   Hirohito's temperature rose from from 98.7 degrees Wednesday
evening to 99.8 degrees Thursday night, Maeda said. His temperature
flared to 102.6 degrees Saturday, but doctors brought it down with
antibiotics.
   About 150 people belonging to a group called the Japan Citizen's
League held a march in Tokyo and criticized Japanese media coverage
that it said implies the whole nation is watching Hirohito's
illness with grave concern.
   ``We were motivated to hold this rally because we didn't want
foreign people ... to think the whole nation of Japan is
sympathizing with the emperor and worried about his illness,'' said
Ryuzo Harada, secretary-general of the organization.
   He said the emperor's limited role should be further restricted
by ``interpreting the Constitution more accurately.'' The postwar
Constitution limits him to a largely powerless symbol of state.
   Satsuki Kase, of the Women's Democratic League, decried
extensive news coverage of the cancellation of sports events and
autumn festivals in view of Hirohito's serious condition.
   ``We knew the media were going to give biased coverage on the
emperor as `X-Day' approaches,'' Ms. Kase said. ``But they're
making it seem as though if your neighbor cancels plans, you have
to as well.''
   A palace official said he did not know if Hirohito was aware of
the cancellations, or whether the monarch was watching television
news or reading newspapers.
   Hirohito, the world's longest reigning living monarch, has not
taken any solid food for 10 days. His eldest son, Crown Prince
Akihito, 54, has taken over all imperial official duties.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports
that Hirohito has cancer and have urged the media to refrain from
such speculation.
   Nearly 2.5 million people have signed registries at the palace
and elsewhwere throughout Japan wishing Hirohito a speedy recovery.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright today accused
Republicans of pursuing a ``partisan political vendetta'' against
him in seeking to investigate him for alleged breaches of
confidential information.
   ``I can take it,'' Wright said. ``As speaker, I'm in the
kitchen, and I'm not offering to get out.''
   The comments came a day after the Democrat-controlled House
Intelligence Committee rejected an effort to turn over classified
information for a requested ethics inquiry of whether Wright
improperly disclosed a secret CIA operation in Nicaragua.
   Wednesday's action, on a party-line vote during a closed-door
session, had been mapped out a day earlier in a private meeting of
committee Democrats, who hold an 11-6 majority on the panel.
   Majority members argued that they were under no obligation to
provide classified information relevant to Wright's disclosure in
part because the House ethics committee, which investigates
breaches of confidentiality, had not formally asked for the
material, said sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Chairman Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, pointedly reminded committee
members as the meeting broke up that the rules prohibit members
from discussing anything done in secret session. The reminder
angered some Republican members, who complained that they
apparently were being put under stricter rules than the speaker and
vowed not to let the matter drop.
   ``It's extremely ironic that we're so concerned about the
committee procedures ... when there's something before Congress on
keeping the secrets of the nation,'' said Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif.
   Wright, D-Texas, told reporters last week that he had ``clear
testimony'' from the CIA that U.S. agents had sought to provoke
demonstrations and civil unrest that would lead to harsh crackdowns
by the leftist Sandinista government. The aim, Wright contended,
was to sabotage faltering peace talks between the government and
the Contra rebels.
   In a subsequent interview, Wright said the information had been
given by the CIA under congressional questioning. But he later
denied violating House rules, contending the information he had
relayed already was publicly known.
   The disclosure prompted House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill., and Intelligence Committee member Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo.,
to formally ask for ethics and intelligence investigations into
whether Wright had violated House rules against divulging
classified information.
   Today, Wright called the request for an investigation
politically motivated.
   ``It is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics
committee, or any other committee of the House, as a cat's paw to
try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another
member,'' he said.
   He said he had ``personally dissuaded'' Democrats who had come
to him ``trying to use the ethics committee to cast aspersions
against at least five Republican members, three of them in the
leadership.'' Wright did not name the targets. ``I talked them out
of it, and they haven't done it,'' he said.
   Asked whether Wednesday's action by the intelligence panel
effectively closed the matter, a grim-faced Cheney responded: ``Not
as far as I'm concerned.''
   It appeared that Democrats, in seeking to head off the
investigation, had traded Wright's potential rules and ethics
problems in the incident for political trouble.
   Republicans indicated they would seek first to have the ethics
committee, formally called the Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct, make a direct request for the information. That committee
is made up of six Democrats and six Republicans.
   If that effort fails, there could be an attempt to raise the
matter on the House floor and further embarrass Wright, GOP
lawmakers confirmed.
   The speaker already is under investigation by the ethics
committee on a variety of allegations that he improperly profited
from his official position and that he improperly intervened with
federal regulators on behalf of constituents. The House on
Wednesday approved a $550,000 boost in the panel's budget to pay
for the mounting costs of that investigation.
   The controversy over Wright's disclosure appeared also to have
doomed the prospects for legislation to tighten Congress' control
over administration covert actions.
   The bill, an outgrowth of last year's Iran-Contra hearings,
would require the administration to let Congress know within 48
hours of any covert action it undertakes. But the measure, which
already has been passed by the Senate, appeared to have slipped off
the House schedule.
   ``We might have to address that next year,'' Wright said when
asked about the legislation Wednesday.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the senior Republican on the
intelligence panel, said he was frustrated by the rules and
admonition that kept members from talking about Wednesday's action.
But he implied the committee's majority had set out to block any
investigation of Wright.
   ``What's at stake is not simply the persona of the speaker, but
whether we should even have an intelligence committee,'' Hyde said.
``... The issue is there. Something has happened that calls for a
reaction by the Congress.''
   Wright had been predicting that the request for intelligence and
ethics probes of him on the issue would be dropped by the panels,
saying the issue was without merit.

   Radical students screaming ``Down with
the Olympics!'' bombarded riot police with hundreds of firebombs
Thursday, and security was increased to prevent attacks at the
Games.
   About 1,000 students clashed with police at Korea University in
the worst street clash since the Olympics began Sept. 17. Fighting
erupted after protesters staged a rally to demand the release of a
jailed student leader.
   Radical leaders said they would disrupt the Olympics before they
end Sunday if police do not release Oh Young-shik, who was charged
Tuesday with violating national security laws for organizing
anti-government demonstrations.
   Authorities have further increased the tight security for the
Games to block possible student attacks.
   At Korea University, waves of charging students pelted riot
troopers with rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of
blazing gasoline. Riot police tried to deflect the missiles with
shields, but the clothes of many caught fire.
   ``Down with the dictators' Olympics!'' and ``Yankee go home!''
radicals yelled as they charged hundreds of riot police blocking
streets with shields.
   Radical leaders charge the government of President Roh Tae-woo
is using the Olympics to impose authoritarian rule and had demanded
that communist North Korea be a host for the Games along with the
South. They are also demanding that the 42,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea be withdrawn.
   Police martial arts squads with batons charged the students,
beating and kicking some protesters. The students pushed back the
police several times. Some police and students were injured by
firebombs and rocks, but police had no casualty figures and no
reports of arrests.
   The fighting was confined to the streets in front of the school
in northeastern Seoul, about 15 miles from where the Games are
being held. The students, who also came from other Seoul colleges,
blocked the main road near the university and tore down part of the
school's walls.
   Firemen tried to douse exploding firebombs with hoses, but
students drove the security forces off with missiles, and police
hosed the clothing of troopers set on fire.
   The police hurled stones and rocks at the students, but could
not fight them with tear gas, which the government has banned
during the Olympics to try to preserve peace.
   Radical leaders said they would disrupt the end of the Olympics,
but security officials said they are taking no chances.
   The Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported in its Friday edition that
authorities deployed 36,000 police to guard the mens' marathon on
the last day, and special checks were being made along the route
for bombs.
   During the Olympics, only small groups of students have turned
out for the mostly peaceful protests and most South Koreans are
critical of the dwindling radical movement.

   The Panchen Lama, the No. 2 spiritual leader of
Tibet, has urged his superior, the Dalai Lama, to return to China,
according to a newspaper report Thursday.
   But the Dalai Lama, in Helsinki, Finland, denied Thursday that
he was in contact with the Panchen Lama.
   ``I have not spoken to the Panchem Lama for at least a year,''
the Dalai Lama told The Associated Press. He appeared bewildered by
the Panchen Lama's statement that they were in direct telephone
contact.
   In an interview with the official China Daily, the Panchen Lama
also said a new commission on Tibetan Buddhism will be set up this
year.
   The body purportedly will give Tibetan Buddhists, who have long
chafed under Chinese sectarian rule, more autonomy in religious
affairs.
   The interview came on the eve of the first anniversary of
violent anti-Chinese protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa and
underscored Chinese attempts to head off further trouble by
adopting a conciliatory stance toward Tibet.
   Last week, China invited the Dalai Lama to hold a ``direct
dialogue'' with Beijing at a place of his choice.
   On Wednesday, the Dalai Lama said he expected talks with the
Chinese government over Tibet in the near future.
   The Dalai Lama, in Finland on a three-day private visit, told a
news conference ``the time was ripe to find a middle way in talks
with the Chinese.'' Earlier this year, he proposed a plan to give
Tibet domestic autonomy while China would control the region's
foreign and military affairs.
   Buddhist monks who led protests on Oct. 1 last year and again on
March 5 that claimed an estimated 38 lives have demanded an
independent Tibet under the Dalai Lama.

<HEAD>Chinese Hope Moscow Visit Will Lead to Summit</HEAD>

   China said Thursday it hopes the first working
visit to Moscow by a Chinese foreign minister in 32 years will lead
to a summit and normal ties.
   During his visit this year, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will
continue talks with the Soviets on the main obstacle to normalizing
relations _ Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, said ministry
spokesman Jin Guihua.
   ``We hope that the Soviet Union will make concrete efforts for
an early settlement of the Kampuchea (Cambodia) question,'' Jin
told a news conference. The Soviet Union is the main ally of
Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia in 1978 and ousted the
Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge.
   The Soviets said their foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
will visit Beijing but gave no date.
   The Soviet and Chinese Communist regimes split in the early
1960s over ideological differences and rivalry for leadership of
the world communist movement.
   Although they retained formal diplomatic relations, their
leaders have not met since Nikita Khruschev visited Mao Tse-tung in
1959. That also was the last time a Soviet foreign minister came to
Beijing.
   Foreign Minister Huang Hua attended Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev's funeral in 1982, but the last working visit to Moscow by
a Chinese foreign minister was in 1956.
   The announcement Wednesday at the United Nations that Qian would
go to Moscow this year was seen as a clear signal that both
countries expect to normalize relations soon. A specific date for
Qian's visit was not set.
   ``There is a lot of arduous work to do between (Qian's visit)
and a meeting of the top leaders of China and the Soviet Union,''
Jin said.
   But he added, ``Of course it can be said that the exchange of
visits between the Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers constitutes
a step forward towards the meeting between the leaders of the two
countries. It is our hope that the two sides will work towards this
direction.''
   The official World Economic Herald in Shanghai, meanwhile,
quoted unidentified diplomats in Beijing as saying a Chinese-Soviet
summit could be held this year or early next year. It did not say
if the diplomats were from one of the two countries or give other
details.
   Qian, 60, spent 10 years in the Soviet Union as a student and
diplomat. He headed China's negotiations with the Soviets over
their disputed border from 1982 until becoming foreign minister in
April.
   His appointment as foreign minister was seen as an indication of
the importance China placed on its gradually warming relations with
the Soviet Union.
   China long has maintained that three obstacles exist to normal
relations with Moscow: the Soviet presence in Afghanistan, the
heavy Soviet troop presence in Mongolia on China's border and the
Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia.
   The Soviet Union began pulling out of Afghanistan this year and
reduced its troops in Mongolia in 1987. In recent months China has
indicated that only Vietnam remains a problem.
   ``The Soviet Union must urge Vietnam to withdraw all its troops
from Kampuchea (Cambodia) at an early date,'' Jin said. ``The
Soviet Union is the sole foreign partner of the Vietnamese. The
Vietnamese cannot fight the war a single day'' with Soviet help.
   Vietnam has an estimated 120,000 troops in Cambodia supporting
the regime it set up under Heng Samrin and battling Cambodian
guerrillas aided by China.
   China and the Soviet Union held their first talks devoted to
resolving the Cambodia issue in August, in Beijing. Both sides said
afterward they found common ground but that differences remained.
   Premier Li Peng said this month that a summit can be put on the
agenda once the two sides come closer on Cambodia. He also said
normalization would not mean a restoration of the Chinese-Soviet
alliance of the 1950s.

<HEAD>Abortion Opponents Mail Anti-Dukakis `Record' to Catholic Parishes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Massachusetts anti-abortion group opposing Gov.
Michael Dukakis' presidential candidacy has mailed copies of his
record on abortion to Roman Catholic parishes in 18 states.
   ``If elected president, he would strongly support and no doubt
accelerate the tax funding of abortion throughout America,''
according to the literature distributed by the group, known as
Campaign Life America.
   Paul DiPersio, the group's leader who runs a heating and
ventilation business near Boston, said he has spent $30,000 to
publicize the Dukakis record.
   ``As governor of Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis has annually
provided the taxpayers' money in his budgets for the brutal
destruction of 8,000 unborn children by abortion-on-demand,'' the
group's literature said.
   Campaign Life America also wrote: ``Each year, 1,100 minor girls
are taken out of state for the purpose of abortion without the
knowledge and consent of their parents!''
   Andrew Dreyfus, spokesman for the state office of Human
Services, said Massachusetts law allows girls under age 18 to
petition courts for permission to have abortions. If a judge finds
that they are ``mature,'' they do not have to have parental
permission.
   Dreyfus said girls who receive court permission are free to seek
an abortion wherever they want, and he said he did not understand
the reference to their being ``taken'' out of state.
   Steven Crawford, a member of the governor's Statehouse press
staff, said Dukakis ``believes someone's right of choice should not
be a function of their economic status.''
   In his debate with Republican George Bush on Sunday, Dukakis
said he personally opposed abortion but believed the decision lies
with the pregnant woman, ``in the exercise of her own conscience
and religious beliefs.''
   At a sparsely attended news conference Wednesday on Boston
Common, DiPersio said the group was sending an ``information
sheet'' to the ``Respect Life'' committees of 28 Catholic dioceses
in 18 states. The group is asking the committees to bring Dukakis'
record to the attention of news media in their areas.

Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis and George Bush took a few moments out to agree
on one thing today, praising the successful launch of the space
shuttle _ then went back to hammering each other over such
down-to-earth issues as toxic waste and tax enforcement.
   Democrat Dukakis accused the Reagan administration of
foot-dragging in cleaning up toxic waste and said chronic polluters
``better vote for Mr. Bush'' in the November election. Republican
Bush renewed his criticism of Dukakis' tax-enforcement plan.
   On Wednesday, during a campaign tour through Illinois by bus,
Bush took aim at Dukakis' plan to step up enforcement efforts
against tax cheats, and today he told a rally in Saint Charles,
Mo., that a Democratic victory in the fall would mean ``a
government hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every home.''
   After the launch of the space shuttle Discovery, Bush told the
cheering crowd, ``The shuttle is launched successfully and America
is back in space.''
   Dukakis told college students at a rally in New Jersey that the
launch made it ``a very special morning. ... We're very proud of
the astronauts.''
   Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen watched the
launch at the Nashville, Tenn., airport, then said, ``It was a
spectacular takeoff. OK, Russians, we're back.''
   Dukakis, in remarks prepared for delivery today at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J., said Bush is to blame for
blocking regulations to reduce lead in the air as well as a plan to
control toxic wastes.
   ``Mr. Bush's administration has had eight years to clean up
toxic wastes,'' said Dukakis. ``They've started the cleanup on only
137 sites on the National Priorities List out of a total of
1,200.'' Dukakis promised that if he is elected ``cleanup will be
completed or well under way at every single one of the nearly 1,200
Superfund sites on the National Priorities List by December 1996.''
   ``For the foot-draggers and the chronic polluters I have just
one message: You better vote for Mr. Bush because if I'm elected
the game is over,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Let me say a word about my favorite harbor,'' Dukakis added,
noting that Bush has criticized cleanup efforts in Boston Harbor.
The Massachusetts governor called it the oldest harbor in America
and said, ``People starting throwing things into it more than a
century before the Boston Tea Party. And Mr. Bush doesn't know what
he's talking about because we're cleaning up Boston Harbor. And
we've had to fight Mr. Bush and the administration he belongs to
every inch of the way.''
   Dukakis rejoined the campaign trail after raising his foreign
policy profile by meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and other foreign officials.
   Bush, who used several appearances in Illinois to decry the
``auditor army'' that Dukakis would create, was continuing a
Midwestern circuit with rallies in Saint Charles, Mo., and Mount
Clemens and Grand Rapids, Mich.
   Bentsen spoke to schoolchildren in Nashville as they awaited the
scheduled launch of the space shuttle. He urged them to consider
becoming ``part of this new generation of space pioneers.''
   Bentsen's Republican counterpart and Senate colleague, Dan
Quayle, was returning to Washington to prepare for next week's vice
presidential debate after a several days in Texas.
   Bush raised the specter of a much larger Internal Revenue
Service during a bus tour of Illinois on Wednesday. In the populist
ploy, Bush accused Dukakis of wanting to ``give the IRS even more
power than it already has to go after the people of America.''
   ``He wants to squeeze another $35 billion bucks out of the
taxpayers' pocket,'' Bush said in Ottawa, Ill., claiming the IRS
would have to double its work force to 200,000 people under Dukakis
in order to carry out his proposal to collect billions of dollars
in delinquent and evaded taxes.
   ``I have confidence in the honesty of the American people,''
Bush said.
   At a rally in Normal, Ill., Bush attacked Dukakis' college-loan
proposal, under which funds borrowed for school would be repaid
over a long period by deductions from paychecks.
   ``We do not need to put the IRS on your tail for the rest of
your life as the reward for a college education,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, as he had done before in discussing U.S.-Soviet
relationships, had kind words after the Shevardnadze meeting about
the Reagan achievements in relations between the superpowers.
   ``I made it clear to the foreign minister that I was not here to
negotiate or discuss specific proposals,'' said Dukakis. ``We have
one president and I support President Reagan's effort to move
forward on these issues right up to the end of his term in office.''
   Dukakis had harsher words for the ethics record of the Reagan
administration, saying that on his first day as president he would
bar top officials who left his administration from lobbying their
former agencies as long as he is in office. People are currently
forbidden from lobbying their former agencies for one year after
leaving office.
   As Dukakis has recently, Bentsen said Bush might tap the Social
Security trust fund to help balance the federal budget deficit and
recalled Bush's 1985 vote against cost-of-living adjustments to
Social Security recipients.
   After urging Dukakis on Tuesday to renounce his membership in
the American Civil Liberties Union, Quayle said Dukakis also
belonged to Boston-based group that calls for steep cuts in defense
spending.
   As Bentsen and Quayle made their debate preparations, an ABC
News-Washington Post poll showed the Bush and Dukakis were in the
same place they were before Sunday's presidential debate.
   The post-debate survey of 674 likely voters showed Bush with 50
percent and Dukakis with 46 percent. A 5-point margin of error made
the difference statistically meaningless.

   Hurricane Helene kept hanging on with 80 mph winds
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean today as forecasters turned
their attention to a newly formed tropical depression.
   National Hurricane Center specialist Gil Clark estimated that
Helene would lose its tropical characteristics and degenerate into
a low-pressure system sometime today or Friday.
   At noon EDT today, the hurricane's center was near 42.5 north
latitude and 41.0 west longitude, or about 540 miles west-northwest
of the westernmost Azores, the hurricane center reported. It was
moving northeast at close to 35 mph, and posed a threat only to
ships.
   Helene will remain a hurricane as long as its winds stay above
73 mph. Spawned last week near the Cape Verde Islands off west
Africa, its winds reached 140 mph before the storm veered north.
   The 16th tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season
formed Wednesday in the mid-Atlantic and was strengthening today.
It was located today about 650 miles east-southeast of Barbados.
The system, with highest winds of 35 mph, was moving west at 15 mph.
   The hurricane season started June 1 and ends Nov. 30.

   President Reagan congratulated the U.N.
peacekeeping forces today for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and
said he wasn't disappointed that he had not won.
   ``No, I didn't deserve it as much (as they did),'' Reagan told
reporters asking about the decision.
   ``It was an admirable decision,'' the president said of the
Nobel Peace Prize Committee's grant of the medallion to the
peacekeeping force.
   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev reportedly were among
the leading contenders for the award for their efforts on behalf of
arms control, including the signing of a treaty eliminating
land-based intermediate- and short-range nuclear missiles.
   The president talked about the decision following a Rose Garden
cermony honoring businesses involved in charitable works.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a note was
sent to the president in the Oval Office as soon as the
announcement of the award in Oslo moved on news wires.
   ``President Reagan today congratulates the United Nations for
its recognition by the Nobel Peace Prize Committee of its
peacekeeping work around the world,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``While the committee praised the peacekeeping efforts in the
Middle East, Cyprus and the Indian subcontinent, they have also
seen that effort in Afghanistan, in the Iran-Iraq cease-fire and
the prospect for a role in Southern Africa,'' he added.
   The president paid tribute to these efforts in his speech at the
opening session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York on Monday.
   Fitzwater said the president extended his congratulations to
Secretary General Javier Peres de Cuellar ``for his leadership in
bringing this new vitality to the United Nations peacekeeping
efforts.''
   Asked whether the president was disappointed that he did not
receive the award, Fitzwater said, ``No, he thinks the U.N. has
done an outstanding job.''
   When asked how the president received the news, his spokesman
said, ``He was given a note after it ran on the wires. ... I gave
him a note after that.''

   A smaller-than-expected crowd estimated
at 250,000 cheered from riverbanks and roadsides today as Discovery
lifted off on America's first manned space mission in 32 months.
   The crowds lining U.S. 1 across the Indian River from Kennedy
Space Center counted down the final few seconds with a NASA
announcer piped in by loudspeaker and broke into shouts of
encouragement as Discovery lifted off.
   They quieted down when the spaceship disappeared behind a layer
of clouds, but the yells began again when it reappeared and became
louder when the crowds heard the announcement at 2 minutes, 4
seconds after launch that the boosters had separated. Challenger
blew up 73 seconds into flight because of a flaw in its right
booster.
   ``Oh my Gosh, it was great,'' said 11-year-old Tommy Mathis of
Detroit. ``it was neat watching ... it just looked like a ball of
fire at first going up. And it went into a cloud halfway up.
   ``As soon as it went out, it was beautiful,'' he said.
   Tens of thousands of people had pitched their tents, parked
their campers and pulled out their lawn chairs starting Wednesday
to grab the best viewing spots.
   But NASA estimates of up to 1 million spectators proved to be
vastly overblown. Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for the Brevard County
Sheriff's office said shortly after launch that she guessed about a
quarter-million people were on hand, although no formal count is
attempted.
   ``It's about the same size or smaller than the first launch,
larger than the most recent launches, but not nearly as big as
anticipated,'' she said.
   No arrests or major traffic problems were reported at launch
time, but at dawn traffic was backed up considerably on roads
leading to the space center.
   At dawn highway embankments were teeming with spectators
searching for breakfast and setting up binoculars and camera
stands. Some even parked illegally outside one of the center gates,
risking having their cars towed.
   ``It's going to work this time,'' Doug Miller, 22, of Wilton,
Conn., said Wednesday outside a tent he and a friend set up in a
field across the Indian River from the Kennedy Space Center. ``We
want to see it.''
   ``It's almost like it's starting all over again,'' said Dean
Lax, 21, a senior at Emory Riddle Aeronautical University in
Daytona Beach.
   Lax and fellow student Joseph Reilley, 27, saw the Challenger
explosion from their campus, a 50-minute drive north of the space
center. They pitched a tent in a field Wednesday morning to be on
hand for Discovery.
   In addition to the public, about 3,000 VIPs including movie
stars and members of Congress planned to watch from a site on the
space center grounds. A record 5,000 journalists sought
accreditation to cover the launch, but only 1,800 were being
allowed at the main press site. The rest were moved further away
from the launchpad because of safety concerns.
   Campers lined many stretches of road shoulder along U.S. 1 in
Titusville, and souvenir stands and portable toilets were put up on
all major highways.
   Health officials set up nine first aid tents along the highways
expected to be most crowded, said Buddy Render, a battalion chief
with Brevard County Fire and Rescue. Render said minor injuries _
cuts, bruises, dehydration _ would probably be all health workers
would have to deal with but ``we're prepared for any kind of mass
casualty incident.''
   Two hospitals were on emergency standby with extra personnel
scheduled.
   Arnold Richman, the space center's chief of visitor services,
had estimated Wednesday that up to 1 million people would show up.
He said hat figure was based on attendance at previous launches,
the midmorning scheduling of the launch and increased interest in
the shuttle because of Challenger and the long grounding of the
space program.
   ``We've been getting calls from all over the country,'' he said.
   Barney Barnes, a 68-year-old retired Air Force pilot from
Paradise, Calif., said watching the shuttle would be like watching
the flag waving. His wife, Nita, 67, agreed.
   ``It just gives you goosebumps,'' she said Wednesday as the
couple sat outside their camper in a Titusville field with a clear
view of the distant launch pad.
   Harry and Norma Perkins came from the Chicago suburb of Homewood
to watch Discovery's launch. The couple, who have seen three or
four other shuttle launches, said the experience was ``very, very
special.''
   ``Brings the tears to your eyes,'' said Mrs. Perkins, 63. ``It
really does. You know, your heart just kind of stops.''

<TEXT>
   An unemployed Houston man whose lack of health
insurance was cited by Democrat Michael Dukakis in the presidential
debate with Republican George Bush is returning a $400 check Bush's
nephew sent him to buy insurance.
   Charles Strickland, 42, who lost his job two years ago when his
Houston energy company moved, said he was upset with the check
because he found it degrading.
   ``When I first opened it up, I felt kind of proud,'' Strickland
said Wednesday at a news conferenee organized by Dukakis staffers.
   ``But the more I read the letter, the more I believed that man
had no concern for me, my son or my family. His main purpose was a
political ploy. As an individual, I'm tired of being used as a
political football on this issue.''
   The check was sent by James R. Pierce, Jr., a Houston insurance
broker, who is a nephew of Barbara Bush, the vice president's wife.
   Pierce on Wednesday denied the check was politically motivated.
He said he was responding only to Strickland's needs.
   ``I'm a little upset about it all,'' Pierce said. ``My
intentions were personally motivated and emotionally driven. I'm
sorry that he thought they were politically motivated, because they
weren't.''
   Strickland told Dukakis a week ago during a campaign stop at a
Houston hospital that he could not allow his 11-year-old son to
play sports in school because he did not have health insurance and
could not afford to buy any.
   Dukakis on Sunday said Strickland's son could not play Little
League because of a lack of insurance.
   Little League officials in Houston complained that Dukakis was
wrong and that insurance was available if parents could not afford
it for their child.
   Pierce said he mailed the check after reading about Strickland
in the newspaper and had not consulted the Bush campaign.
   ``It's unfortunate you try to do something good and it gets
twisted by the many cynics in the world,'' Pierce said.
   In his letter to Strickland, Pierce said the Dukakis platform
``will only drag all American wage earners back into the malaise
days. The cost of his social programs will only make it harder for
you to improve your family's standard of living.''
   Strickland, in a letter accompanying the returned check, said
Republicans ``have made my life and my story into a political
publicity ploy.
   ``Mr. Pierce, we don't need to be patronized,'' Strickland
wrote. ``We need a health insurance program like the one Mike
Dukakis has proposed for the nation and like he has done in
Massachusetts. I don't need your pity.''

<TEXT>
   Kuwait has reopened its embassy in Tehran and
stationed two diplomats there in a major step toward improving
relations with Iran, a senior Iranian diplomat said Thursday.
   Iran and Cyprus said they will establish full diplomatic
relations. Iran will open an embassy in Nicosia to be headed by a
charge d'affairs and a Cypriot ambassador will be accredited to
Tehran, the two countries announced.
   Mohammad Faroughy, Iran's charge d'affaires in Kuwait, told The
Associated Press that relations between the Persian Gulf neighbors
were warming following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran repeatedly had accused Kuwait of directly aiding Iraq in
the 8-year-long conflict.
   Kuwait expelled five Iranian diplomats last September, reducing
Iran's embassy staff to Faroughy and an aide, after mobs stormed
the Kuwaiti Embassy in Tehran following riots in the holy city of
Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
   But Kuwait stopped short of actually severing ties with Tehran
as Saudi Arabia did later, citing Iranian subversion and terrorism.
   Well informed sources said the Kuwaiti diplomats in Tehran are a
charge d'affaires and a counselor, putting Kuwaiti representation
on a par with Iran's.
   The improvement in relations is part of a trend set in motion by
Iran's July 18 unconditional acceptance of the U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire and peace talks to end the war.
   France and Canada have restored ties with the Islamic republic,
and Britain is moving in that direction. The United States still
has no relations with Iran, which held 52 Americans hostage in the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981.
   Relations between Kuwait and Iran hit their lowest point in
August 1987 after more than 400 Moslem pilgrims, 275 of them
Iranians, were killed in what the Saudis said was Iranian-inspired
rioting in Mecca. Iranian mobs stormed the Saudi and Kuwaiti
missions in Tehran.

   A rescue convoy stood by
at the shuttle's Mojave Desert landing site in case of an emergency
today, but once Discovery reached orbit the ground crew settled
down to prepare for the scheduled touchdown in four days.
   The shuttle is to complete its mission with a landing here
Monday morning on the hard, clay-like surface of Rogers Dry
Lakebed, but ``We're ready to support a landing anytime during the
mission,'' NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said Wednesday.
   The lakebed is the prime site for an earlier emergency landing,
including what the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
calls an abort-once-around, a landing after one low orbit spurred
by a premature shutdown of the main shuttle engines following
launch.
   ``The only reason they wouldn't come here (for an
abort-once-around) would be weather _ if there were flooding (of
the lakebed) or severe winds,'' said NASA spokesman Franklin
O'Donnell.
   But the Air Force forecast sunny skies, temperatures climbing to
near 90 degrees and winds up to 17 mph for today _ acceptable
conditions for an emergency landing here.
   Bad weather here during an abort-once-around would force the
shuttle to land at White Sands, N.M., or back at the Kennedy Space
Center launch site in Florida.
   Loss of two main engines soon after launch would dictate a
trans-Atlantic abort landing at Ben Guerir, Morocco; Moron, Spain;
or Banjul, Gambia. A shutdown of the engines even earlier might
require a return-to-launch-site landing in Florida.
   A 110-person recovery convoy of NASA and Air Force rescuers was
ready to wait out the launch in NASA's shuttle operations area
here, then drive numerous rescue and service vehicles onto the
lakebed if an emergency landing was needed, Lovato said.
   After any landing, technicians check for hazardous vapors around
the shuttle orbiter, then connect various cooling and gas-purging
lines to the spacecraft. Plans call for the shuttle crew to emerge
from the orbiter 30 to 40 minutes after landing.

<TEXT>
   The crew of the Delta Air Lines plane that
crashed last month at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
gave no indication of trouble in the moments before the crash,
according to a tape released today of crew conversations with air
traffic controllers.
   Fourteen people were killed in the crash.
   A transcript of the air traffic control tower tapes, released by
the Federal Aviation Administration, showed the Delta jetliner took
about 22 minutes to taxi from its gate to the point at which it
began rolling down the runway on Aug. 31.
   There was no word from the aircraft, flight 1141 with 107 people
on board, between the time the co-pilot acknowledged receiving
takeoff clearance and the crash.
   ``Fire at the end of the runway,'' an unknown voice was heard to
say on the tape in the first indication that something unusual had
occurred, according to the transcript.
   Four seconds before the remark and presumably after the Boeing
727 already had crashed, someone on the plane attempted to
communicate with the tower, but managed only to give the flight
number.
   The two pilots and flight engineer were among those who survived
the crash, although all three were injured.
   At one point someone could be heard saying, ``Flames out of the
left side of the engine,'' but FAA officials said that appeared to
be a remark picked up by the controller's microphone from someone
in the tower.
   The remark was not included in the official transcript.
   Federal investigators have ruled out engine failure as a cause
of the crash after it was determined that none of the plane's
engines had experienced a mechanical failure.
   After the crash, controllers began rerouting incoming aircraft
and ordering jets awaiting takeoff to halt in their tracks.
   ``Emergency equipment rolling?'' an unknown voice asked 55
seconds after the plane's flames were noticed.
   ``Affirmative,'' replied the controller.

   The federal government, trying to
settle a 17-year-old dispute over a sewer grant, has tied up the
city's bank accounts.
   The federal court action Wednesday came just as the city was
about to obey another court order and write a check for $82,397 to
pay firefighters' clothing allowances owed for years.
   It was the third time this year a court has frozen the city's
accounts.
   In a separate matter, a judge today dropped civil and contempt
charges against Mayor Carl Officer stemming from an extra $80,000
the mayor received from the cash-strapped city.
   St. Clair County Circuit Judge Robert Craig dismissed the
charges at the request of county prosecutor John Baricevic, who
would not say why he made the request.
   Baricevic ``knows he didn't have a case against him,'' said
Officer's lawyer, Eric Vickers.
   At a hearing Aug. 29, Craig had held Officer and East St. Louis
in contempt of court after they failed to provide him with records
explaining the $80,000 transfer to Officer.
   Baricevic said Officer got the money between 1984 and last year,
in addition to his annual salary of $30,000. But two of the mayor's
top aides told the judge that many of the city's financial records
couldn't be found.
   An arson fire at the old City Hall Annex may have been to blame
for the problem, said Assistant City Attorney Kenwyn Redding. He
also blamed past City Hall workers, whom he did not identify.
   On Wednesday, city Treasurer Charlotte Moore said she expected
to have enough money on hand after paying off the firefighters to
write paychecks for city workers for the first time since Aug. 30.
   But that was before she learned the federal Environmental
Protection Agency had obtained another freeze on the bank accounts.
   Officer told a City Council meeting that the city is going to
have to chop the payroll.
   ``We're going to have to cut and cut deep,'' he said.
   He said the amount sought by the EPA will bring the projected
city deficit for the rest of the year to $700,000.
   U.S. Attorney Frederick Hess said the latest freeze arose out of
the misuse of the EPA sewer grant. The federal government, which is
seeking $221,175, contends the city of 55,000 did not act on the
project in a timely manner.

   William P. Rogers, the head of the
commission that investigated the tragic Challenger explosion, said
today's successful launch of the shuttle Discovery was ``a
wonderful day'' for the space program.
   Rogers and about 2,000 VIPs watching the launch from a special
site about 6{ miles away from the pad hooted and cheered as the
shuttle soared through blue sky until it could no longer be seen.
   ``In my days, the sky was the limit. It's not the limit any
more,'' Rogers said after the launch.
   Two relatives of Challenger astronauts also watched the liftoff
at Kennedy Space Center from a different location than most of the
other VIPs, said NASA spokesman Arnold Richman, though he was not
sure where.
   Scott Smith, son of pilot Michael Smith, and Claude Onizuka,
brother of mission specialist Ellison Onizuka, were on hand to
watch the first shuttle mission since their relatives were killed
along with five other Challenger astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   At the VIP site, at least one celebrity joined former astronauts
and members of Congress watching the launch from bleachers.
   Actor John Travolta told reporters before the launch he was a
guest of former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, whom he had met in a movie.
   Asked if he would like to go into space someday, Travolta, a jet
pilot for eight years, said, ``I'd love to.''
   NASA set up one VIP viewing area 6{ miles from the launch pad to
accommodate about 2,000 invitees and one nearby to seat about 2,000
more.
   Special guests of NASA had watched the Challenger liftoff from
the same seaside pad from only three miles away, but for safety
reasons the space agency limited the number of people allowed that
close for today's launch.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said about 3,000 special guests sought invitations to the launch,
and by Wednesday afternoon, about two-thirds had said they would be
there. NASA spokesman Eugene Marianetti said the agency does not
solicit VIPs to watch the launches.
   ``They come to us,'' he said. ``We get a lot of criticism when
celebrities do come ... but the fact is that most of the people
watching (from VIP areas) will be average American people.''
   Sen. John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, and Sen.
Jake Garn, R-Utah, who flew aboard Discovery in April 1985, watched
the launch from the main media site about 4 miles from the pad.
   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the only other member of Congress who
has flown in space, also was at the space center for the liftoff
and was flying back to Washington shortly after.
   Several other former astronauts were on the guest list,
including Saudi Arabian Sultan Al Saud, who was a payload
specialist on one of the shuttle missions.
   Others who had been expected to attend, including entertainer
John Denver, never arrived.
   Denver, who wants to ride aboard the Soviet Mir space station,
recently spent three days at the Johnson Space Center undergoing a
medical evaluation given to all astronaut applicants. He was one of
several Americans asked by the Soviets to fly in their space
program, according to a spokeswoman for Denver.
   Other VIPs watching included Lt. Gen. James Abrahamson, whose
resignation as director of the Strategic Defense Initiative,
President Reagan's space-based missile defense program known as
Star Wars, was announced Tuesday. Abrahamson is a former associate
administrator of NASA's Office of Space Flight.
   William P. Rogers, who headed the presidential commission that
investigated the Challenger explosion, and other members of that
panel, were expected. So were members of the National Research
Council, an arm of the American Academy of Sciences that NASA
appointed to oversee the shuttle redesign as a result of the Rogers
Commission recommendations.

<HEAD>Navy Needs Electric Propulsion in 21st Century, Admiral Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's top admiral has decided America's
next class of warship is going to rely on electricity for
propulsion.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, in a speech delivered at a classified
symposium, announced to industry officials the Navy no longer would
just dabble in researching ``integrated electric drive propulsion''
but instead would embrace it as the power plant of the future to
replace diesel, gas turbine or nuclear propulsion.
   ``In view of its many well-known advantages, I am declaring that
integrated electric drive, with its associated cluster of
technologies, will be the method of propulsion for the next class
of surface battle force combatants,'' said Trost, the chief of
naval operations.
   ``And I am directing all the major Navy organizations involved
in these efforts to concentrate their energies toward that
objective. It's something that has stayed in the laboratory too
long, and we need to tear down those barriers that have prevented
its development.''
   With electric drive, a warship would use a conventional engine
to power a generator, which in turn would produce electricity for a
motor that would turn the propeller shaft. That, in turn, would
eliminate the need for reduction gears and other mechanical engine
machinery, Trost said.
   ``Electric drive is an old idea with a remarkable new
potential,'' the four-star admiral asserted. ``The advantages we
can already see are enormous ... And that's just the basic
technology itself.''
   Among other benefits, the advent of electric-drive systems would
put sufficient electrical-generating capacity on Navy warships to
power exotic weapons of the future like lasers and ``directed
energy weapons,'' the admiral added.
   Trost served as the keynote speaker Monday at a two-day
symposium sponsored by the U.S. Naval League and held behind closed
doors at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at White Oak, Md.,
outside Washington.
   The symposium was designed to assess the Navy's view of what its
combat fleet might look like in the 21st century and while closed
to the public, the Pentagon release an unclassified version of
Trost's speech on Wednesday.
   According to Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, the
service has studied electric propulsion for surface warships off
and on for years, always devoting relatively small amounts of money
to the work. Indeed, Navy ships have been built in the past with
electric drive units, but they always left something to be desired
in performance, the spokesman noted.
   The march of technology, however, already has improved
performance and more gains can be made, Trost told his audience. A
modern, efficient electric propulsion system offers huge savings in
weight and manpower along with new flexibility in designing a
ship's hull and more room for weapons to be packed aboard, the
admiral added.
   Quigley and other Navy officials said they were unaware of any
specific new breakthrough or study that might have prompted Trost's
decision.
   The admiral himself, in his speech, cited recent advances in the
field of superconductivity, but suggested he mainly was trying to
break down institutional barriers to change.
   ``In other words, we need a firm goal,'' Trost declared. ``This
is a case where the benefits of a specific application of
technology are so obvious that we need to invert the normal scheme
of things.''
   The Navy is just now beginning to build a new type of surface
warship _ the so-called Arleigh Burke class of destroyers _ and
thus probably won't begin designing another until well into the
1990s.

<TEXT>
   Researchers have isolated and purified a
mystery substance they suspect is linked to high blood pressure, an
affliction that leaves nearly 60 million Americans at dramatically
higher risk of stroke and heart disease, it was announced Thursday.
   People with high blood pressure are believed to have increased
levels of the substance, which researchers have yet to identify, in
their blood.
   Isolation of the compound, which appears only in trace amounts,
should speed up identification and manufacture of a synthetic
version of the substance to be used in future studies, said John
Hamlyn, an assistant professor of physiology at the University of
Maryland at Baltimore.
   ``What we think is that having more of it in the circulation may
be effectively raising blood pressure,'' said Hamlyn, who has been
working to isolate and purify the substance from blood plasma for
six years.
   Once the substance is identified, synthesized and available for
wide study, Hamlyn predicted, it will still be at least eight to 10
years before new relief for sufferers of high blood pressure is
available.
   Hamlyn presented his research results at a conference of the
American Heart Association's Council on High Blood Pressure
Research. The study was conducted with scientists from the Upjohn
Co., which also provided funds for the project.
   Harvey Gonick, an adjunct professor of medicine at the
University of California at Los Angeles who is working in the same
field, called Hamlyn's development a ``major move in the right
direction.''
   Identification and synthesis of the substance will have
extraordinary implications for treatment of disease, he said.
   ``There's been a worldwide race ... toward trying to isolate,
identify and purify this hormone, and that race is yet to be won,''
said Gonick. ``But he's made a step in the right direction.''
   The substance, which has no name, appears to increase the amount
of sodium and calcium in cells, Hamlyn said. Sodium and calcium
work together to regulate the contraction of muscle cells in blood
vessels. When cells are unable to pump out enough sodium, calcium
levels go up and tension in the artery wall increases, causing
blood pressure to rise.
   But the association between the mystery substance and blood
pressure levels has been difficult to investigate because the
material appears in trace amounts, said Hamlyn. One metric ton
(about 2,200 pounds) of blood plasma typically yields an amount
barely visible in the bottom of a test tube, he said.
   ``No one has been able to measure it very well,'' said Hamlyn,
who hopes researchers will be able to identify the material within
a year. ``Everything depends on finding out what the substance is.''
   Possible strategies for counteracting the substance once it is
identified include inhibiting its production, designing a compound
to block its effect or accelerating its breakdown in the body, said
Hamlyn.

   About 10,000 U.N. soldiers in blue helmets
and berets are deployed from the Persian Gulf to the snows of
Kashmir in peacekeeping operations.
   The seven U.N. peacekeeping and observer operations are based on
the principle of minimal use of force. The peacekeepers, who won
the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday, operate only with the
consent of the parties concerned and they are permitted to fire
their light arms only in self-defense.
   The U.N. soldier is protected not by his weapons, but by nearly
universal regard for the impartiality and fairness symbolized by
the blue and white U.N. logo of the world wreathed by an olive
branch.
   He is not a combatant and he supports neither side in classic
no-win situations. He is at home counting withdrawing troops or
persuading shepherds to graze their flocks away from sensitive,
unmarked borders.
   But that didn't protect U.S. Lt. Col. William Higgins, a U.S.
Marine observer in southern Lebanon. He was kidnapped in February
by Moslem fundamentalists and was wearing a U.N. blue beret when he
was abducted.
   The official U.N. definition of peacekeeping is an operation
involving military personnel, but without enforcement powers,
established by the Security Council to help maintain or restore
peace in areas of conflict.
   They aim to control conflicts, prevent escalation, patrol buffer
zones and create breathing time and space to allow tensions to cool
and political peacemaking to operate.
   ``If you don't use peacekeepers, then other countries see the
threat or the use of force as practical options'' to fill a vacuum,
U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding said Thursday. He is
in charge of peacekeeping operations.
   ``Peacekeeping is a revolutionary idea, a major U.N. innovation
pioneered in the Middle East'' in 1948 and still evolving, said
former U.N. Undersecretary-General Brian Urquardt, in charge of
peacekeeping for years.
   U.N. peacekeeping costs about $230 million a year and U.N.
officials say that likely additional operations in southern Africa,
Western Sahara and Cambodia will raise the total to $1.5 to $2
billion annually.
   Over the years, about 500,000 U.N. personnel have been involved
in U.N. peacekeeping and observer operations, drawing forces from
58 nations. The United Nations says 733 peacekeepers have lost
their lives since 1948.
   The latest U.N. peacekeeping operation was deployed Aug. 20 to
supervise a cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. It involves
about 1,500 lightly armed soldiers in blue helmets and support
personnel in blue berets.
   Another team of 50 unarmed observers is deployed in Afghanistan
and Pakistan to monitor a U.N.-mediated Afghanistan agreement
calling for pullout of Soviet troops.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces and observers are expected to be
deployed in southern Africa this fall, in Western Sahara to
supervise elections and in Cambodia to monitor a Vietnamese troop
withdrawal.
   Other U.N. peacekeeping and observer forces operate in the
Middle East, in in Cyprus and along the disputed India-Pakistan
border of Kashmir.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar writes in a book on
peacekeeping, ``In a time of nuclear armament, it is more than ever
important that regional conflicts in sensitive areas should be kept
out of the sphere of possible great-power nuclear confrontation.
   ``I believe that this novel but still fragile creation is an
important addition to the armory of peace in the nuclear age. ...
It is an indispensable and potentally highly effective weapon in
the struggle for world peace.''

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops fired on hundreds of
looters in three separate incidents Thursday, killing 18 people and
wounding eight, state-run Rangoon Radio announced.
   The ruling party announced the formation of a new central
executive committee and claimed more than half the employees of
five ministries have returned from a crippling pro-democracy strike.
   But a Western diplomat said Thursday the government workers only
planned to pick up their paychecks and were doing little
constructive work.
   The military government has ordered all civil servants workers
back to work Monday to end a pro-democracy strike that has crippled
Burma's government and production, leading to severe food and
medical shortages.
   The strike, which began Aug. 8, has become the most effective
form of protest since Gen. Saw Maung led a Sept. 18 coup and
brutally suppressed anti-government street demonstrations.
   On Thursday, 12 people were killed when troops opened fire on a
group of about 200 people looting a warehouse at the Rangoon port,
the radio said.
   The broadcast said four more died and three were arrested after
100 people tried to loot a Construction Ministry facility in Kaba
Aye, north of the capital. The other two casualties were from a
looting incident in Thamaing, also north of Rangoon.
   Diplomats say hundreds of people have been slain and many
wounded since the coup. Before Thursday, the government listed
about 350 people killed, although the National League for Democracy
placed the dead at nearly 1,000.
   The radio also announced the National Unity Party has named 15
leaders of the party, formerly known as the Burma Socialist Program
Party, to its new central executive committee.
   Party leaders appointed Tha Kyaw chairman of the new panel, the
broadcast said. Tun Yee was named general secretary and Than Tin
joint general secretary. All three were top leaders in the earlier
party, Burma's sole political party since 1962.
   Saw Maung has promised multiparty elections but set no date for
the polling.
   The National League for Democracy, the main opposition alliance,
urged workers to ignore the government's order to return to work
Monday. They want protesters to remain on strike until democracy is
won.
   But one diplomat based in Bangkok, Thailand, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the authorities ``have won for now.
There is not much the opposition can really do right now.''
   State radio said Wednesday that 74 percent of the Ministry of
Planning and Finance employees were at work. It said more than half
of the employees showed up at the ministries of health, home and
religious affairs, and culture and trade.
   ``A lot of people are going back to work now so they can pick up
their paychecks,'' said the Western diplomat in Bangkok, who noted
that pay comes at the end of the month in Burma. ``We've had
reports of people sitting around drinking tea.''
   In Bangkok, the U.N. Children's Fund planned to fly 103 tons of
emergency medical supplies and equipment to hospitals in Burma to
help hundreds of people wounded in anti-government demonstrations.
An agency official said the first of six flights will begin Friday
from Bangkok to Rangoon.

<HEAD>No Pay Hike for Lawmakers in $1.8 Billion Congressional Spending
Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a $1.8 billion 1989
appropriations bill for Congress' own expenses Thursday, an
election-year measure devoid of a pay raise that many lawmakers had
talked about giving themselves.
   The measure was approved on a 253-133 vote and sent to the
Senate for final congressional approval.
   The appropriations bill was one of five remaining that
legislators are racing to complete by Saturday's start of federal
fiscal year 1989. If all 13 are enacted by Saturday, it would be
the first time since 1948 that all of the spending measures that
finance government agencies were in place in time for the new year.
   Members of Congress have received base annual salaries of
$89,500 since February 1987. But lawmakers have been coming under
increasing public criticism for the large sums of money most of
them receive for giving speeches to industry, labor and other
groups.
   The amount of the payments _ called honoraria _ legislators can
keep each year can total up to 30 percent of each representative's
salary, and up to 40 percent of each senator's pay.
   Lawmakers have discussed lowering or eliminating the amount of
honoraria permitted in exchange for increasing the base pay. After
House-Senate negotiators working on the bill discussed the
proposals briefly on Wednesday, they agreed not to address the
issue in the spending measure.
   President Reagan is scheduled to propose salary adjustments for
Congress and top federal officials in January. His proposal will be
based on the recommendations that a special federal salary
commission are scheduled to make in December.
   The money in the bill represents a 3 percent, or $59 million,
increase over 1988 legislative spending. Of the total package, $506
million is for the House and $341 million for the Senate. The rest
is for joint items such as the Capitol Police and for congressional
agencies such as the Library of Congress.

<TEXT>
   A tearful Mayor Peter Knudson spoke
for many of Morton Thiokol's 8,000 Utah employees when he called
today's successful launch of the shuttle Discovery ``one of the
greatest moments of my life.''
   Employees at the rocket-maker's Wasatch Operations 25 miles west
of here erupted in cheers as they watched the launch on television
monitors. America's return to space followed to 32 months of
corporate agony.
   ``We're all delighted with the launch. There are lot of very
happy people here at Morton Thiokol.'' said Mike Ayers, acting
director of finance and administration for space operations.
   Today's successful launch was in sharp contrast to the Jan. 28,
1986, Challenger disaster which killed seven astronauts. The
tragedy was caused by a faulty joint seal on one of Morton
Thiokol's 126-foot-long boosters, which allowed a plume of fiery
gas to escape, triggering the explosion that doomed Challenger.
   A pair of the company's redesigned boosters hurtled Discovery
spaceward today.
   The mayor, a dentist, was unable to watch the launch because he
was with a patient. But when informed by a reporter it was a
success he struggled to speak through his emotion.
   ``This is one of the greatest moments of my life,'' he said.
``We're not talking jobs here. We're talking emotions, people's
sense of worth.''
   He said about two-thirds of Morton Thiokol's 8,000 Utah
employees reside in the city and its environs.
   Hundreds of Morton Thiokol officials and engineers were at Cape
Canaveral for the launch. Reporters were barred from company
premises in Utah, in part so employees could watch the launch in
private, said spokesman Rocky Raab.

<TEXT>
   One of the most prominent members of the
U.N. peacekeeping forces, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
was in captivity Thursday and was unable to celebrate the Nobel
Peace Prize with his comrades.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Kentucky, headed a 76-member observer
group attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon before he was
kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988 near this southern coastal city.
   An underground group calling itself the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth has claimed responsibility for his abduction,
charging he used his U.N. uniform to spy for the United States.
American and U.N. officials denied the charge.
   The kidnappers, believed to be Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to
Iran, have issued four communiques and a videotape since his
abduction, demanding Israel's withdrawal from an occupied enclave
in south Lebanon.
   They also demanded the release of all Lebanese and Palestinian
guerrillas held by Israel. None of their demands have been met.
   The kidnappers have made no statements about Higgins since April
21, when they issued their fourth and last communique. It said he
would be put on trial on espionage charges.
   But on July 8, Palestine Liberation Organization spokesman
Bassam Abu Sharif said in a published interview that Higgins was
abducted to thwart a plan hatched to rescue eight other Americans
held hostage in Lebanon.
   Abu Sharif was quoted by the Beirut daily Ad-Diyar, which is
based in Christian east Beirut, as saying that the PLO obtained ``a
transcript of the interrogation with Higgins.'' He did not say how
the PLO had obtained it.
   According to the alleged transcript, Higgins had headed the
operations department of the anti-terrorist U.S. Delta force,
widely referred to as the Rapid Deployment Force.
   The nine Americans are among 18 foreigners missing and believed
kidnapped in Lebanon. The longest held is American Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

opposition figures with whom he has met.
   ``However, dialogue cannot be a substitute for action,'' she
said. ``We believe the Avril government must take concrete steps to

interdictions and create credible plans for economic development to
allieviate the suffering of Haiti's poor.''

<TEXT>
   Six high school dropouts were notified
Thursday that they will lose their driver's licenses unless they
re-enroll in school, the first teen-agers affected by new education
legislation.
   Ron Bolen, director of the state Department of Motor Vehicles
safety and enforcement division, said letters went Thursday to four
boys and two girls.
   The Legislature earlier this year passed a 300-page bill
rewriting much of the state's education law. One provision calls
for the suspension or revocation of driver's license privileges for
dropouts under 18 years old.
   ``As far as I know, it's the first in the nation,'' state
Schools Superintendent Tom McNeel said Thursday. ``Our bill was the
first in the country where a driver's license would be revoked if a
person is not in school.''
   Bolen said the notification carries a 30-day waiting period
before the revocation takes effect. Those notified will lose their
licenses Oct. 30 unless they enroll in a general education course
to earn a high school diploma, Bolen said.
   West Virginia's dropout rate was 17.4 percent last year, down
considerably from 27 percent a decade ago, McNeel said. But he said
the rate remains too high. West Virginia's dropout rate ranked 28th
nationally in 1986, the most recent rankings available, state
officials said.
   McNeel said educators are split over the legislation, but he
endorses it.
   ``Being a parent of teen-agers, I believe it has some merit,
maybe considerable merit,'' he said. ``It is something the
teen-agers value and perhaps many individuals will be convinced to
stay in school because of that. It is one of the tools we should
use.''
   State Delegate Robert Harman, a Republican who also is a Mineral
County school administrator, objected to the driver's license
provision in the education bill, saying some students may need to
drop out of school to help their parents earn a living.
   In addition, Department of Motor Vehicles lawyer Wyatt Hanna
said his agency's appeals process for license revocations could
take years, meaning a student likely would be 18 _ and exempt from
the law _ once the final appeal is heard.
   Bolen said the six students notified live in rural Pocahontas
and Braxton counties, in the central and central-east parts of the
state. Carolyn Spangler, spokesman for the Education Department,
said Braxton's dropout rate was 22.9 percent and Pocahontas'
dropout rate was 15.7 percent.
   School officials notified the DMV that the students ``either
voluntarily or involuntarily have withdrawn from secondary schools
and are under 18 years or age,'' Bolen said. The ages range from a
little over 16 to nearly 18.
   Bolen declined to identify the students, saying he believes they
have confidentiality rights and ``I don't believe it is proper for
them to read in the newspapers without getting the notification
first from us.''
   If the students decline to re-enroll and show proof of that to
the DMV, they have the right to an administrative appeal and then
can resort to the regular court system, Bolen said. ``We'll notifiy
them of that,'' he said.
   Bolen said he expects county schools systems to begin notifying
his office on a regular basis about dropouts now that the program
has started.
   He said he has received 34 names from four counties, but just
eight of those students had licenses. Two notifications were
shelved because the students will be 18 by the time the DMV could
contact them, he said.
   McNeel said several states either are considering similar
legislation.

   Patrick Swayze and Cher top US magazine's annual
readers poll of the 10 sexiest men and women, according to results
released Thursday.
   Swayze's ``Dirty Dancing'' co-star, Jennifer Grey, was named
ninth, it said.
   But Tom Selleck, last year's No. 1, slipped to No. 6 after
hanging up his ``Magnum, P.I.'' Hawaiian shirt, US said. Don
Johnson was in the same boat: down to No. 8 after capturing No. 4
last year and No. 1 two years ago.
   Actress Demi Moore made the list at No. 10 while her new
husband, actor Bruce Willis, ``took a flyer for the first time in
three years,'' said US.
   Meg Ryan came in eighth; her boyfriend, Dennis Quaid, was 10th.
   The readers think that domesticity is sexy, US said. The winners
have 20 children between them (five are Mel Gibson's, three are
Kevin Costner's.) And one more (Selleck's) is on the way.
   Cher, 42, the Oscar-winning actress, is known both for her
devotion to motherhood and her romance with 24-year-old Rob
Camilletti. Swayze, 36, a former ballet dancer, lives with his wife
of 12 years, Lisa Niemi, on a ranch near Los Angeles.
   The other winners, in order:
   2. Jane Seymour, 37; Tom Cruise, 26.
   3. Kevin Costner, 33, and Jaclyn Smith, 41, who ``slipped a
notch from last year.''
   4. Kathleen Turner, 33; Mark Harmon, 37.
   5. Cybill Shepherd, 38; Mel Gibson, 32.
   6. Madonna, the Material Girl, who turned 30 this year; Tom
Selleck, 43.
   7. Donna Mills, 44; Rob Lowe, 24.
   8. Meg Ryan, 27; Don Johnson, 38.
   9. Jennifer Grey, 28; George Michael, no age given.
   10. Demi Moore, 25; Dennis Quaid, 34.

<HEAD>Talks Over Blood Test Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer representing a 9{-year-old girl
wants genetic tests done to settle the question of her biological
parents, but he wants them done in Florida and he wants the results
kept secret, at least for now.
   But Marvin Ellin, a lawyer representing a Pennsylvania couple
who think the Sarasota girl may be their biological daughter, said
he will seek a court-order Monday to have the sophisticated blood
tests conducted by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
   Secrecy for the tests is unacceptable, said Ellin. ``They
wouldn't be able to disclose the fact that she is their daughter,
they wouldn't be able to file evidence of it.''
   Negotiations between Ellin and Tampa lawyer Dale Swope collapsed
Wednesday in a dispute over who will do the testing and the
confidentiality of the results.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., claim in a $100
million lawsuit that their healthy baby girl was switched at tiny
Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula in central Florida with a
fatally ill newborn in 1978.
   Birth records show that only one white girl, the Sarasota child,
shared the nursery with the Twigg baby, so the case has focused on
her.
   Swope, who represents the girl's father, said the tests must be
kept secret.
   ``If it produces unsettling results, they will be kept
confidential until our client has had a chance to explain this
tragedy to his child. Then, in time, after she has adjusted to it,
we will disclose it to other interested parties.''
   The baby the Twiggs took home from the Wauchula hospital
suffered from a congenital heart defect. The couple nursed the sick
girl, Arlena Twigg, through a painful life until she died Aug. 23
following surgery.
   Tests taken before a heart operation at a New Jersey hospital
indicated Arlena's blood type was different from theirs. Further
sophisticated protein-matchting tests ruled out any biological
relationship with the Twiggs.

<HEAD>Five Extremists Planning Anti-Aquino Coup Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intelligence agents arrested five
suspected right-wing extremists and uncovered evidence of new
efforts to overthrow President Corazon Aquino, the military said
Thursday.
   In a separate incident near Manila airport, police killed four
robbers who attacked an American army officer lured into a car by a
Philippine woman, police said.
   Also near the airport, soldiers shot and killed six people who
refused to stop at a checkpoint, police said. Troops said the
passengers opened fire.
   Among those arrested for planning to topple Mrs. Aquino's
government were three former soldiers and two civilians, said Brig,
Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, Manila military commander. Four were arrested
late Wednesday and the fifth was captured Thursday, he said.
   Biazon told reporters one of the suspected subversives was
Master Sgt. Domingo Escarcha, alleged founder of the Black Force
Commandos, a group of renegade soldiers who staged several coup
attempts.
   Biazon said nearly 70 suspected right-wing extremists were
arrested in recent weeks, including Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano, a
leader of last year's bloody coup attempt, who was arrested Tuesday.
   He said that during the raids, police found documents pointing
to financial support from unidentified ``outside sources.'' He did
not elaborate.
   On Tuesday, Biazon said the latest series of arrests ``severely
crippled'' recent attempts by subversives to launch another coup
attempt. He said more arrests were expected.
   Biazon told a House of Representatives committee Wednesday that
unidentified businessmen and opposition politicians were under
surveillance for possible links to military renegades, including
former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan.
   Honasan led the failed Aug. 28, 1987 coup, in which at least 53
people were killed and 300 were wounded. Matillano was one of
Honasan's lieutenants in the coup attempt. Both were arrested and
escaped separately in April.
   Honasan was chief of security under former Defense Minister Juan
Ponce Enrile, who was fired in 1986 after a failed coup attempt by
his followers.
   Sen. Enrile, vice chaiman of the Union for National Action
oppositon party, denied Thursday he was personally linked to the
mutineers and said he was ready to defend himself in court if the
government tried to implicate him.
   Also Thursday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told a
congressional committee that the military estimated about 25,800
Communist rebels were operating nationwide, of whom about 12,800
were armed. The rebels have been waging a 19-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.
   In the robbery near Manila airport, U.S. Army Capt. Michael
Smith was offered a ride to his hotel by a woman shortly after he
arrived at Ninoy Aquino International Airport from Tokyo early
Thursday, police said.
   They said the woman told Smith she would charge him less than
the regular taxi fee and he agreed. Soon after, she stopped the
car, telling Smith she had a flat tire.
   Four armed men asaulted the American officer, robbing him of his
valuables and luggage and driving off with him. They dropped Smith
off behind the suburban Makati Medical Center and sped away.
   He then flagged down police, who pursued the robbers and shot
and killed them, police said. It was not known what happened to the
woman.

<HEAD>House Approves $46.6 Billion Farm Money Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Thursday approved a $46.6 billion
money bill for the nation's farm programs, including for the first
time a ceiling on a major export program that has boosted overseas
sales of agricultural products.
   ``We have held the line, we have preserved and restored basic
domestic programs, which is the most important thing,'' House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., said
as the House approved the bill 353-35.
   The measure, produced this week by a House-Senate conference
committee, is awaiting action in the Senate.
   The bill would furnish $46.6 billion in new budget authority,
compared with last year's level of $56.2. billion. However, actual
outlays in the fiscal year starting Saturday would be only $26.9
billion.
   The bill would provide $8.8 billion for the government-owned
Commodity Credit Corp., which operates the nation's major crop
subsidy programs.
   Other big-ticket items include: $13.6 billion for food stamps;
$1.929 billion for the nutrition program for women, infants and
children; $1.48 billion for humanitarian food exports to the Third
World; and $1.864 billion for the Conservation Reserve Program.
   The Conservation Reserve Program pays farmers to take highly
erodible land out of production for a decade.
   One reason for the large difference between budget authority and
actual outlays is that the amount earmarked for the CCC is, in
effect, a reimbursement to a revolving fund and not counted as an
outlay. In other cases, outlays are not expected to go up to the
full authority.
   In a major development, House and Senate negotiators decided to
cap expenditures under the Export Enhancement Program, a major
export subsidy, at $770 million in the upcoming fiscal year.
   The program, established under wide-ranging 1985 farm
legislation, pays in-kind bonuses of surplus crops to spur
exporters to send American wheat, feed grains and other commodities
overseas.
   In establishing the program, lawmakers aimed at drastically
reducing the huge surplus of crops that at the time was piled up in
warehouses at taxpayer expense and give a shot in the arm to
overseas sales of American farm goods.
   Since the launch of the program, it has provided more than $2
billion in these bonuses to the world's largest grain companies and
other exporters.
   In its quest for savings in farm programs, the House had sought
to cap fiscal 1989 expenditures at $900 million. But the conferees
opted for the Senate level of $770 million.
   The panel also held to $200 million another export subsidy
established under the 1985 law, the Targeted Export Assistance
Program, under which the government pays for advertising and other
promotional expenses of American products overseas.
   The authorized level for the program is $325 million but it has
come under fire from lawmakers who question the use of taxpayer
funds to boost sales of brand-name products.
   Commercial honey producers, who long have benefited from
open-ended payment programs, suffered a setback under the bill. It
would bar them from collecting more than $250,000 a year as a
result of price-support loan forfeitures.
   Under normal farm-program procedures, farmers may obtain
price-support loans from the government-owned Commodity Credit
Corp., using their crops as collateral and then deliberately
forfeit the collateral and keep the loan if that would yield them
greater earnings.
   Lawmakers thought they had capped potential benefits under the
program at $250,000 several years ago, but a handful of large-scale
honey producers found a legal way to circumvent that ceiling. The
bill aims to close that loophole.
   ``We hope this ends the funny business in the honey business,''
said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., who has been engaged in a
long-running fiscal duel with the nation's commercial beekeepers.

<HEAD>Gay Ex-Policeman Files $5 Million Discrimination Suit Against LAPD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ex-police sergeant who finished first in
his academy class has filed a $5 million lawsuit against the Police
Department, claiming he was discriminated against and endangered
because he is homosexual.
   Mitchell Grobeson said Wednesday that he was refused back-up
help when he requested it during life-threatening situations.
Grobeson, 29, also claims co-workers set up an arrested person to
make false charges against him.
   In addition, he claims he met separately with Mayor Tom Bradley,
Police Commission President Robert Talcott, a lieutenant and three
captains, but none investigated his complaints.
   The Police Commission also is named in the suit along with
Police Chief Daryl Gates and numerous officers.
   Lt. Fred Nixon, a department spokesman, said the department does
not comment on litigation.
   However, Nixon said the department has a policy of
non-discrimination for reasons of sexual preference or religion or
ethnicity and added, ``This is something we've stated very clearly
before, and our record would support that.''
   ``The Los Angeles Police Department is one of the best
departments in the United States, if not the world,'' Groebson
said. ``But there are severe problems in management. Changes need
to be made, not necessarily in the people who are there, but in
their policies and practices.''
   In the lawsuit, Grobeson alleges that on several occasions
fellow officers refused to come to his assistance in potentially
life-threatening situations.
   Grobeson's suit also claims he received at his station items
such as a package labeled ``AIDS survival kit'' and a picture of
Rock Hudson, who died of the disease, inscribed, ``To Mitch, Love
Rock Baby.'' The word ``Beware'' was scrawled on his private car
while parked in a locked police lot, the suit alleged.
   The National Gay Rights Advocates, also a plaintiff in the suit,
is seeking a court order barring the department from the alleged
discriminatory practices.
   Grobeson, on the force for nearly seven years before resigning
June 13, finished first in his class at the Police Academy and was
honored for his work in resolving a stand-off last winter between
property owners and the homeless who were camped on Venice Beach.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush are ardently
courting that segment of the electorate known as Reagan Democrats,
moderates who left their party twice to vote for Ronald Reagan.
   Estimated at roughly 10 percent of the electorate, these voters
have different backgrounds and interests, experts say.
   In the North they tend to be ethnic, Catholic, and often blue
collar, says Dukakis pollster Irwin ``Tubby'' Harrison. In the
South, they tend to be Protestant, not ethnic, and as likely to be
in white-collar as blue-collar jobs.
   What they share are moderate or conservative leanings and views
that Reagan touched when he was campaigning for president in 1980
and, to an even greater extent, in 1984.
   They are by definition among the larger group of swing voters
that will decide this election.
   ``It's fair to say Reagan Democrats are an important target for
both campaigns,'' said Mark Mellman, a consultant to Democratic
campaigns. ``Those are the kind of people among whom there is
movement.''
   For the Democratic nominee the struggle is to offer these voters
a reason to return to their party and what were once traditional
voting patterns. For Bush, the Republican, the task is to present
himself as representing a continuation of Reagan's policies.
   In both cases the candidates are using the economy to reach
those voters: Bush, citing sustained economic growth; Dukakis,
playing on unease about the future and the unevenness of the
prosperity.
   ``In their hearts, they know that four more years of Reaganomics
would be bad for the country, and that four more years of
Reaganomics without Reagan would be a disaster,'' Dukakis said in a
direct appeal to those voters recently in Arkansas.
   Bush strategists acknowledge he has had some difficulty reaching
these voters. Bush was booed earlier this month by union members in
a Portland, Ore. shipyard.
   Bush Chief of Staff Craig Fuller said the campaign wants to win
back these Reagan Democrats and is trying to schedule appearances
aimed at them and emphasize issues with appeal to them.
   Bush has been sounding themes that worked so well for Reagan _
strong defense, patriotism, anti-crime, and attempting to portray
his Democratic rival as a liberal, a ``card-carrying member'' of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Virtually every piece of the Dukakis campaign strategy is
devoted to returning these voters to the Democratic fold. His
reference to ``the middle class squeeze,'' his latest campaign
theme, focuses on these voters as slighted by the Reagan prosperity
and now needing two incomes to pay for what one income once did.
   His calls for new ways to make college education affordable and
to extend health insurance to all Americans are similarly aimed at
these voters. A week spent trying to strengthen his image on
defense was aimed in part at these voters, particularly in the
South.
   The so-called Reagan Democrats don't make up the entire group of
swing voters. There are also independents, voters with no party
identification and whose votes are up for grabs each election.
   But polltakers distinguish those independents from those who
retain party identification, even if it is only in their own minds.
   So far there is no clear signal which side will win them.
   An ABC News-Washington Post poll taken Sept. 21-27 found the
Reagan Democrats evenly divided, 48 percent preferring Bush and 43
percent Dukakis.
   A CBS News-New York Times poll taken Sept. 8-11 found 9 percent
of its sample of ``probable voters'' were the Reagan Democrats. Of
this sliver of the electorate, Dukakis had 44 percent of them, Bush
had 34 percent, and 19 percent were undecided.
   If Bush succeeds in winning these voters, it may further shake
their identification as Democrats. Experts say that for these
voters to cast a third presidential vote for a Republican would
represent a major step toward a more permanent political alignment.
   And even so, Bush does not need to win all of these voters to be
successful.
   ``The Constitution doesn't require that you win with 60 percent
of the vote, as Ronald Reagan did (in 1984),'' Mellman said. ``You
don't have to get all Reagan Democrats in order to win. To look at
those numbers and say, `Gee, he (Bush) is only getting 50 percent
of them,' is a little bit foolish.''

   A congressional candidate who kicked off
his campaign by announcing he was gay withdrew from the race
Thursday because of a heart ailment that hospitalized him twice in
one week this month.
   ``I can't ignore this message from my heart,'' Michael Gelpi
said at a farewell breakfast meeting. ``It's with sincere regret
that I am resigning from this campaign.''
   The 47-year-old Columbus businessman said he has notified the
Franklin County Board of Elections that he is withdrawing from the
12th District race. Gelpi, who was running as an independent, won
the endorsement of the Democratic Party after it was learned that
Michael P. Brown, who ran unopposed in the Democratic primary, is a
supporter of extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Brown will face Republican U.S. Rep. John R. Kasich of
Westerville in the Nov. 8 election.
   Shortly after a campaign appearance Sept. 14, Gelpi said he went
to the hospital after feeling severe chest pains. He underwent
angioplasty, a procedure that uses a balloon to open clogged
arteries near the heart. One week later, he was again hospitalized
and again underwent angioplasty.
   He said he feels healthy now, and will campaign on behalf of the
Democratic presidential ticket and U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbuam, a
Democrat who is seeking re-election against Republican challenger
George Voinovich, mayor of Cleveland.
   Gelpi said he took his doctors' advice to withdraw from the
race, but he said his political future looks healthy.
   ``We have a whole bunch of posters, bumper stickers and badges
left, none of which say 1988 on them,'' he said, smiling. ``We're
going to put them in storage.''
   He said he has few regrets about his campaign, including his
acknowledgement of his sexual orientation. Gelpi said at the time
he wanted to make the issue public to avoid making it a major issue
in the campaign and to allow him to concentrate on other subjects,
such as health care and housing.
   ``You know, people really didn't care. They wanted to know where
I stood on the issues,'' he said. ``I'm pro-choice, I'm
pro-teacher. They could have found 14 other reasons not to vote for
me other than I'm gay.''

   A second victim of a gunman's rampage at
an elementary school died today, a few hours after students and
teachers returned to class for the first time since the shooting
spree that also left nine people wounded.
   The man accused in Monday's shootings at Oakland Elementary
School said in an interview published today that he was copying a
similar rampage by a woman in Winnetka, Ill., and also thought of
the taunting he suffered as a child.
   James William Wilson, 19, said that as he pulled the trigger on
his grandfather's .22-caliber pistol, he was remembering being
picked on by classmates at other schools for being overweight and
dressing funny, The State newspaper of Columbia reported today.
   Eight-year-old Tequila Thomas, a third-grader hospitalized in
critical condition since she was wounded, died shortly after noon
today at Self Memorial Hospital, said Dan Branyon, a hospital
spokesman.
   Another 8-year-old girl, Shequila Bradley, died at the school.
   ``All of us here at Self Memorial, as well as the community of
Greenwood, the state of South Carolina and, I'm certain, the rest
of the country join in expressing our deepest sympathy to the
family of this little girl who put up such a valiant battle for
life,'' Branyon said.
   ``Tequila never regained consciousness from the time of her
arrival'' at the hospital, Branyon said.
   Children in this city 75 miles northwest of Columbia returned to
classes at the 600-pupil school a bit nervously this morning.
   Leah Holmes, 8, her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound she
suffered Monday, shook her head emphatically and said ``Nope,''
when asked whether she was scared to return to school. But other
children and parents arriving at the school said they were jumpy.
   There was a police officer on every corner of the school grounds
and at least three officers were stationed at the front of the
building as parents and children arrived.
   ``We're a little nervous, but it's just been a shock
primarily,'' said Alan Maxwell, as he walked his daughter Katy to
school.
   Wilson, who is charged with murder, was interviewed Wednesday by
the newspaper by telephone at the State Hospital in Columbia, where
he is undergoing psychological testing. Relatives have described
him as a hyperactive recluse who has been in and out of a hospital
psychiatric unit during the past eight months.
   Witnesses said Wilson shot pupils who screamed during Monday's
incident.
   ``I thought some of the students in the school were after me,''
Wilson said in the interview. ``I was trying to make them be quiet.
   ``I feel real bad about what happened.''
   On May 20, Laurie Dann killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded six
people in and around a school in the affluent Chicago suburb of
Winnetka before killing herself.
   ``I could understand where she was coming from,'' Wilson said.
``I think I may have copied her in a way.''
   He said he was thinking about an article about Dann that he had
torn from a June issue of People magazine. ``I read it every day,''
he said.
   Wilson also said he was up all night before the shootings
reading a book about John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted in 1980 of
killing 33 men and boys, most of whom were buried under his
suburban Chicago house. Gacy is on death row in an Illinois prison.
   Asked if the book was a factor in the shootings, Wilson said,
``It's possible.''
   He said he had contemplated the shootings a couple of times, but
there wss nothing in particular that triggered the act.
   Wilson said he remembered little of the shootings. ``It was like
a fog or a dream,'' he said, recalling pupils fleeing through
windows and blood on a hallway floor where a teacher was shot.
   ``I remember being at the back of the school with my hands up
and the police arresting me,'' he said. ``I don't remember feeling
anything.''
   Two teachers who were wounded remained hospitalized today, and
one of six students treated and released was admitted today in fair
condition, complaining of discomfort from her wounds.
   Physical education teacher Kat Finkbeiner, who was shot in the
hand and mouth while trying to subdue the attacker, and teacher
Eleanor Hodge were in good condition, Branyon said.
   Oakland Elementary Principal Eleanor Rice and other school
officials talked with about 500 students and parents Wednesday
night to help ease the return to school, which has kindergarten
through fourth grade.
   Ms. Rice praised school staff members for trying to protect the
children.
   ``But it wasn't enough,'' she said. ``Each child in Oakland is
loved, and loved dearly. We do everything in our power to make
school a healthyplace and a happy place. But at this time, we feel
helpless.''

   Here is a transcript of the launch
communications among ground controllers, commentators and Discovery
in the moments before and following Thursday's shuttle launch.
   At 15 seconds before liftoff:
   Kennedy Space Center commentator Hugh Harris: ``T-minus 15, 14,
13, 12, 11, 10 _ we are go for main engines starts _ 7, 6, _ we
have main engine starts _ 3, 2, 1, 0 _ and liftoff! America returns
to space as Discovery clears the tower!''
   Spacecraft: ``Roll program.''
   Mission Control: ``Roger roll, Discovery.''
   Mission Control: ``Houston now controlling.'' (meaning
communications with the astronauts have shifted from the launch
team at KSC to Mission Control at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston.)
   JSC Commentator Steve Nesbitt: ``Three engines are running at
104 percent.'' (the normal rate.) Three good APUs.'' (Auxiliary
Power Units which provide electricit to operate key systems during
launch and landing.) ``Three good fuel cells.'' (Fuel cells are
electrical generators.)
   Nesbitt: ``Standing by to throttle down to 65 percent.''
(Meaning the engines are slowed slightly to reduce the acceleration
stress on the spacecraft.)
   Nesbitt: ``Throttling down now to maintain a certain speed of
the spacecraft as it passes through Max-Q.'' (The point of maximum
dynamic pressure caused by the stress of speed and acceleration
through the atmosphere.) ``Three engines at 65 percent now.''
   Nesbitt: ``Standing by to see the engines throttle back up at
about 59 seconds. Mark one minute, velocity 2,300 feet per second
(1,568 mph), altitude 5.9 nautical miles (6.7 statute miles),
down-range distance 3 nautical miles (3.4 statute miles).''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, go at throttle up.''
   Discovery commander Frederick Hauck: ``Roger go!''
   Nesbitt: ``Discovery with go at throttle up, three engines at
104 percent, velocity 3,200 feet per second (2,181 mph), altitude
10.8 nautical miles (12.4 statute miles), down range distance eight
nautical miles (5.5 statute miles).''
   Nesbitt: ``Twenty-five seconds from solid rocket booster
separation. One minute, 25 seconds, three engines at 104 percent.
Velocity 4,800 feet per second (3,272 mph), altitude 20 nautical
miles (23 statute miles), down-range distance 19 nautical miles
(21.8 statute miles). Standing by for solid rocket booster
separation.''
   Nesbitt: ``Solid rocket boosters have separated. Two minutes, 20
seconds, three engines still running at 104 percent, 5,600 feet per
second velocity (3,818 mph), 31.8 nautical miles altitude (36.5
statute miles), down-range distance 38 nautical miles (33 statute
miles). Three APUs still running at normal speed. Three good fuel
cells. We'll hear call ups very shortly from the Capcom (the
astronaut in mission control who does the actual communications
with the Discovery astronauts) about the capability to reach
trans-Atlantic sites.''
   Nesbitt: ``Velocity 6,200 feet per second (4,227 mph), altitude
(unintelligible), down-range 60 nautical miles (69 statute miles).''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, two engine Moron.''
   Hauck: ``Roger.''
   Nesbitt: ``That call indicating Discovery may be able to achieve
a trans-Atlantic abort (emergency landing) at Moron (Spain) if that
were to become necessary. Current status at Mission Control is that
all positions report go. Three engines 104 percent, velocity 7,600
feet per second (5,181 mph), altitude 53 nautical miles (60.9
statute miles), down-range distance 107 nautical miles (123 statute
miles). Standing by for negative return.''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, negative return.''
   Hauck: ``Negative return.''
   Nesbitt: ``That call up indicates that Discovery now can no
longer turnaround and return to the launch site in the event of an
abort. Four minutes, 20, velocity 8,700 feet per second (5,931
mph), altitude 59 nautical miles (67 statute miles), down-range
distance 148 nautical miles (170 statute miles).''
   Nesbitt: ``Stand by for press to ATO call.''
   Mission Control: ``Press to ATO,select Banjul.''
   Spacecraft: (unintelligible)
   Nesbitt: ``Call indicates Discovery could reach an abort to
orbit on two engines if there were to become necessary. Five
minutes, three seconds, velocity 10,300 feet per second (7,022
mph), altitude 65.7 nautical miles (75 statute miles), down-range
distance 203 miles (233 statute miles.) Standing by for press to
MECO call.''
   Mission Control: ``Press to MECO, (rest unintelligible).''
   Hauck: ``Roger.''
   Nesbitt: ``They have given a press to a main engine cutoff call,
indicating they can proceed to normal main engine cutoff on two
engines if that were to become necessary.''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, performance nominal.''
   Hauck: ``Roger. Nominal.''
   Nesbittd: ``Six minutes, 10 seconds, velocity 13,900 feet per
second (9,477 mph), altitude 68 nautical miles (78 statute miles),
down-range distance 323 nautical miles (371 statute miles).''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, single engine Banjul 104.''
   Hauck: ``Roger.''
   Nesbitt: ``Call up indicates Discovery could achieve a single
engine landing at Banjul (International Airport in Gambia, West
Africa) if that were to become necessary. Banjul is one of the
trans-Atlantic abort sites. Six minutes, 50 seconds, velocity
16,400 feet per second (11,181 mph), altitude 66 nautical miles (75
statute miles), down-range distance 405 nautical miles (465 statute
miles). Guidance also reports that good navigation aids and main
engine cutoff is expected at 8:33.''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, single engine press, 104.''
(meaning the spacecraft had achieved velocity and altitude to reach
a normal orbit on a single engine).
   Hauck: ``Roger.''
   Nesbitt: ``Discovery is told they can press on to main engine
cutoff in the event of a two-engine failure. Three engines running
at 104 percent, three good fuel cells, three good APUs. Engines are
beginning to throttle up now to maintain 3 Gs (acceleration
forces). (unintelligible) minutes, velocity 22,500 feet per second
(15,340 mph), altitude (unintelligble), down-range distance 618
nautical miles (710 statute miles). We've got about 80 percent
throttle down, maintaining 3 Gs on the vehicle, 10 seconds away
from main engine cutoff. Velocity 24,600 feet per second (16,772
mph), altitude 59 nautical miles (67 statute miles), down-range
distance 700 nautical miles (805 statute miles. Standing by for
main engine cutoff. Main engine cutoff confirmed. Discovery's three
main engines now have shut down as programmed.''
   Mission Control: ``Discovery, nominal MECO. OMS one not
required.'' (meaning that the engine shutoff as planned and the
spacecraft was high enough that a firing of the orbital maneuvering
engines was not required to achieve orbit.)
   Hauck: ``OK. Thank you Houston.''

<HEAD>Baltimore Mayor's Drug Legalization Proposal Gets No Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore advocated
the legalization of illicit drugs to a House committee Thursday but
received no support from lawmakers.
   Fellow mayors who appeared as witnesses with him declined to
endorse his recommendation for legalization but said the idea
should be researched, discussed and debated.
   Schmoke told the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control
that for the past 75 years the United States has considered illicit
drugs a law enforcement problem, a policy that has not reduced
addiction or crime.
   ``It has been demonstrated that the criminal law enforcement
system's ability to do anything about the medical problem of
addiction is very limited,'' he said. And he said law enforcement
has not only failed to solve the problem of drug-related crime but
has worsened it.
   ``Let us begin a phased-in process of fighting drug addiction as
a public health problem, not as a crime problem,'' said Schmoke.
   First, he said, would be the elimination of criminal penalties
for marijuana possession and the reallocation of money and manpower
from interdiction efforts to drug abuse programs.
   Schmoke said his second recommendation would permit health
professionals to distribute methadone, heroin and cocaine to
addicts as part of supervised maintenance or treatment programs.
   Thirdly, he would establish an independent commission to study
substances of abuse, including tobacco and alcohol, and make
recommendations on how they should be regulated based upon their
potential for harm.
   ``If we are going to have a new war on drugs, I would rather
have it led by the surgeon general and not the attorney general,''
said Schmoke, a former prosecutor.
   The heavily attended hearing was prompted by a speech and
subsequent television apprearances Schmoke made last spring in
arguing for legalization and decriminalization of illicit drugs.
   Mayors Edward Koch of New York, Donald C. Master of Charles
Town, W. Va., and Dennis Callahan of Annapolis, Md., opposed
legalization. Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C., said he
didn't have an opinion on legalization but thought it should be
discussed and debated.
   Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., and members
Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., and Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., also
opposed legalization. Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., said the issue
should be researched.
   Koch said the suggestion that drugs should be legalized is
shocking. ``In part because of the frustration some have had with
the difficult task of addressing the drug problem, the idea of
legalization has been elevated, undeservedly, to a place within the
realm of debatable, if not potential, policy alternatives,'' he
said.
   ``When people say that we should legalize drugs because law
enforcement efforts have failed, they ignore the fact that a truly
effective war has yet to be launched against drugs,'' said Koch.
``What we really need to do is more, not less.''
   Rangel, who has long opposed legalization, said he was concerned
about the impact of drugs on the future of the United States.
   ``But unlike some of those have grown weary of this crisis, I am
in no way ready to give up and say that we have fought the fight
and have lost the war on drugs,' he said. ``I am not ready to give
up when we have yet to begin the fight. We have not even fired the
first shot.''

<HEAD>Intervening In Robbery For Second Time, Man Shot Dead
^Eds: UPDATES throughout with arrest, police saying same man
involved in both robberies; CORRECTS that slaying occurred Tuesday,
not Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 26-year-old man has been charged with
robbing two taverns and shooting to death the man who tried to stop
him both times, police said today.
   Joseph William Riegler, a 67-year-old widower known as Old Joe,
was slain Tuesday night after intervening in the robberies just
hours apart at his two favorite taverns.
   Investigators first believed the robberies were unrelated, but
now have charged Patrick O'Brien Kelly with both, as well as
pistol-whipping Riegler at the first tavern and shooting him to
death at the second, police spokesman Dave Simpson said.
   Riegler was shot to death outside The Table tavern in northeast
Portland by a man who walked into the bar with a knife, cut the
cord on the cash register and walked out with the machine.
   ``It's the ultimate hard-luck story,'' police Detective Steve
Baumgarte said. ``He's at the first tavern when some guy comes in
and robs the place. He tries to stop him and gets pistol-whipped.
   ``He goes to the hospital, is treated and released. He ends up
at a second tavern and that place is robbed,'' Baumgarte said.
   ``Against the warnings of the other patrons, he gets involved.
He follows the robber outside and is shot in the head.''
   Simpson said investigators believe it was a coincidence that
both Kelly and Riegler headed for the same tavern after the first
robbery. The man who robbed The Table wore a ski mask, while the
robber of The Cracker Box tavern did not, however.
   Kelly also was charged with trying to kill a police officer by
ramming his car when officers tried to arrest him, Simpson said.
   Detectives began watching Kelly after receiving information that
implicated him in both robberies and arrested him Wednesday night,
he said.
   He was held without bail pending arraignment this afternoon.
   Friends said Riegler, a regular at both taverns, took the
robberies personally.
   ``He felt someone was breaking into his home,'' said George
Dixon, owner of The Cracker Box. ``He liked coming in here. He was
content to have a beer or two and just visit with friends.''
   In the wake of the killing, Dixon said he was considering
closing his tavern.
   ``My feelings are right now that I'm going to lock this place up
and close the sucker down for good. But when his funeral is over,''
he said, ``I'm going to open it up one more time.
   ``I'm going to invite all his friends in, and we'll drink a
toast to him.''

   Three infants were saved from a burning
apartment building when they were tossed from a second-story window
to the waiting arms of a neighbor.
   The neighbor then had to coax the mother of two of the children
to jump, Firefighters credited Odell Espinoza with saving his
neighbors' lives.
   ``I finally said, `This is your last chance. Either jump now or
get burned,''' Ms. Espinoza said after Wednesday's fire.
   Nineteen-year-old Erica Hagens suffered a fractured ankle and
minor back injuries after jumping from the window. Gerod Smith, 16
months, Gerich Smith and Cordaro Hagens, both 4 months, were
uninjured, the fire department reported. One child is Ms. Hagens'
niece.
   Ms. Hagens' mother, Vivian White, 41, also escaped injury when
she climbed out a second-story window to a porch roof and was
lowered down.
   Ms. Hagens said she was asleep with the children when her mother
awoke her and warned her about the smoke. Ms. Hagens couldn't get
downstairs because heat and smoke filled the stairwell.
   Fire officials said the blaze was started by a pile of clothing
left too close to a gas water heater.

   Santa Ana winds fanned an arson
fire and another blaze, burning nearly 6,000 acres of brush and
three structures, forcing residents to flee and threatening homes
and other buildings.
   Up to 150 homes were ordered evacuated just before 5 a.m. today
and classes at three schools were canceled as flames from one of
the intense blazes continued to burn out of control and winds
surged up to 60 mph, officials said. By late morning, it appeared
the danger had passed as the fire skirted around the development.
   ``It looks like they made it,'' said Mary Steward, spokeswoman
for the California Department of Forestry.
   The larger fire, dubbed the Texas blaze, had blackened more than
5,200 acres and was just 20 percent contained early today, after
having been about halfway contained the previous day, she said.
   Emergency workers canvassed several blocks of Rancho Cucamonga
before dawn urging residents to move to safety at a shelter set up
in a community center, said Paula Pachon, spokeswoman for the
town's emergency services office.
   The Texas fire erupted Wednesday morning at the mouth of Duncan
Canyon, 50 miles east of Los Angeles. Forestry Cmdr. John Timmer
said the fire was set, but provided no details.
   Two miles away, wind fanned to life the embers of a controlled
burn near Glen Helen that was thought to have been doused Tuesday,
authorities said. More than 1,000 firefighters battled the two
fires.
   The Verdemont Boys Ranch, a juvenile detention center, some
homes and a high school in the northern Rialto area were evacuated
as a precaution because of the Glen Helen blaze, which covered
about 675 acres and had been surrounded, or contained, late
Wednesday before showing signs of flaring up, Ms. Steward said.
   The Texas fire destroyed two outbuildings and a ranch house as
it weaved among about 60 structures, half of them ranch homes.
Property losses were estimated at more than $374,000, Ms. Steward
said.
   One civilian was treated for smoke inhalation, authorities said.
   ``The wind and the low humidity are the primary causes for the
fire to be spreading so quickly,'' Timmer said.
   The other blaze erupted in an area where authorities
intentionally burned overgrown brush the day before, said forestry
spokeswoman LoVae Pray-Martines.
   Fred Curtis, 73, said a firebreak he cut last spring was all
that saved his house from flames that leapt about as he rushed to
put out hotspots.
   A quarter-mile away, a chimney and smoldering posts were all
that remained of another ranch house. A gutted pickup truck stood
in the driveway. Nearby was a portable swimming pool filled with
ashes 3 feet deep.
   Flames licked within a few feet of Dave Landmesser's chicken
ranch, but a sprinkler system for keeping the birds cool stopped
the flames.
   ``It works good for cooling chickens and it worked good for
putting out a fire,'' he said after finding only five of his
175,000 birds killed by smoke inhalation.
   Marcia Nave, who lives in the hillsabove Fontana, said she
loaded her van with jewelry, photographs and heirloom guns but
waited until the last minute to leave.
   ``We had to drive through flames. I was afraid of catching the
van on fire,'' Ms. Nave said as tears formed in her eyes. ``I don't
know what has happened to my house.''
   Interstate 15, the main link between Los Angeles and Las Vegas,
was closed temporarily when flames leaped across it Wednesday.
   The National Weather Service predicted northeast winds through
today because of the Santa Ana, a condition in which air flows from
high pressure over the Great Basin of Nevada toward low pressure
off the California coast.
   Elsewhere in the West, more than 1,800 firefighters at
Yellowstone National Park concentrated their efforts on hot spots.
Though warmer weather was forecast, recent snow and rain should
keep the flames down, officials said.
   To prevent erosion, rehabilitation crews began filling in the
fire lines dug this summer as flames scorched half of the
2.2-million-acre park.

   A Brazilian jetliner with more
than 98 people aboard was hijacked today by a man who killed the
co-pilot and at least one passenger, officials said.
   Mona Cury , a spokeswoman for the VASP, or Viacao Aerea Sao
Paulo airline, said Flight 375 was on its daily run from the Amazon
jungle city of Porto Velho to Rio de Janeiro on the southeast
Atlantic coast when it was hijacked.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma said in Brasilia, the capital,
that the hijacker was a man who apparently was mentally disturbed.
   Col. Eden Asvolinsque, an air force spokesman, said in Brasilia
that the hijacker ``invaded the cockpit and forced the crew to
surrender.''
   He said the plane was ordered flown to Brasilia, 750 miles
northwest of Rio. However, bad weather forced the pilot to land in
Goiania, a city 150 miles from Brasilia, he said.
   Avolinsque said an Air Force jet intercepted the hijacked plane
and accompanied it to Goiania. State and federal police surrounded
the plane, and an Air Force official was negotiating with the
hijacker, he said.
   During the hijacking, the co-pilot and a passenger were killed,
possibly by gunfire, the airport authority at Rio's Galeao
International Airport said.
   ``The co-pilot is dead, and so is one passenger. That's all we
know,'' said Fatima Pereira dos Santos, a spokeswoman at Rio's
Galeao International Airport. Pereira dos Santos said ``an
incident'' occurred after the plane, a Boeing 737-300, made a
scheduled stop in Belo Horizonte, 288 miles northwest of Rio.
   ``The plane took off from Confins airport in Belo Horizonte on
schedule at 10:45 a.m. Afterwards there was an incident on board,''
she told The Associated Press. She said details of the incident
were not known.
   Pereira dos Santos said the plane was carrying 98 passengers and
an unknown number of crew members.

   Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth joked
Thursday he'd rather ``watch a baseball game'' than view next
week's televised debate between the vice presidential candidates.
   Ueberroth spoke at Creighton University in Omaha, which will
host the debate Oct. 5 between vice presidential candidates
Republican Dan Quayle and Democrat Lloyd Bentsen.
   The American League and National League playoff starting times
have been adjusted to allow nationally televised coverage of the
vice presidential debate on that date.
   ``The election of leaders in this country is far more important
than a baseball game,'' Ueberroth said at a news conference
following his speech. ``Having said that I'd rather watch a
baseball game. But we're going to accommodate the debate.''
   Ueberroth said he would not pursue a political career following
his final day as baseball commissioner March 31, saying he was too
blunt to be a good politician.

<HEAD>Du Pont to Begin Production of Substitute for Ozone-Destroying
Chemical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. plans to begin commercial
production in 1990 of a substitute for one of the most important
ozone-destroying chemicals, the one used in auto air conditioners,
the company announced Thursday.
   The company said it will spend more than $25 million to install
a unit at its Corpus Christi, Texas, plant to make HFC-134a, a
short-lived fluorocarbon containing no chlorine that the company
intends to sell for the refrigeration uses of CFC-12, one of the
chlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds.
   The company said millions of tons of the chemical would be
produced commercially each year compared with tens of thousands of
tons available for research from three small pilot plants.
   Since it contains no chlorine, the new compound has no effect on
the ozone layer when it breaks up in the atmosphere.
   Joseph P. Glas, director of Du Pont's Freon products division,
said the company had told its foam-blowing customers for CFC-12
that it would stop offering the compound for that use when a
subsititute becomes available next year, and it will withdraw
CFC-12 from refrigeration markets as the new compound becomes
available.
   Also, he said, the company would support recycling initiatives
at auto repair shops to recover CFC-12 and process it for re-use in
cars that need it.
   Liz Cook, ozone specialist for the environmental group Friends
of the Earth, praised Du Pont's announcement, saying, ``Du Pont is
clearly trying for the gold medal in the substitute race.''
   There have been estimates that as much as 75 percent of CFC-12
sold for auto air conditioners is wasted in the replacement
markets, simply thrown away by mechanics and motorists as leftovers.
   Du Pont is ``taking a significant risk, but a risk our board of
directors insists we take'' in deciding on production before the
completion of toxicity testing, Glas said.
   Though the industry testing consortium will not begin until next
year the two-year laboratory animal studies necessary to establish
or rule out a chemical as a cause of cancer, Glas said, ``We have
very high confidence the acute toxicity is low,'' and testers have
finished ``initial screens on mutagenic properties and that looks
pretty good.''
   One reason the CFC compounds are so widely used is they are
normally non-reactive, non-flammable and non-toxic. It takes the
powerful ultraviolet rays of the sun, normally shielded by ozone
high in the stratosphere, to break up CFC molecules, which
liberates their chlorine to attack the ozone that keeps those
cancer-causing rays from reaching the surface of the earth.
   Major producing nations agreed last year to cut CFC production
by 50 percent in 1998, but the Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday its latest analyses show the compounds should be dropped
around the world. DuPont, the world's largest producer, said in
March it would end production by the end of the century.
   Du Pont and other companies have announced several CFC
substitutes, but Thursday's announcement was the first for the
important refrigeration market for CFC-12. Some 90 million vehicles
use it in air conditioners; 75 percent of the nation's food is
chilled or frozen with it and it is in every home refrigerator.
DuPont estimates the market at 40 percent of some 330,000 tons of
CFCs used in the United States each year.

   The Duchess of York decided Thursday
to extend her tour of Australia by two weeks to celebrate her
birthday with husband Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.
   That will increase the time that the duchess is spending away
from her newborn daughter, Beatrice, who stayed in London.
   ``Beatrice is not old enough yet to miss her mother. It's more
important I spend time with Andrew,'' the Daily Mail quoted her as
telling guests at an official dinner.
   The royal couple had been separated since shortly after
Beatrice's birth in early August when the duke left on a Far East
tour aboard HMS Edinburgh.
   The duke and duchess originally were to leave Australia on Oct.
7.
   The princess turns 29 on Oct. 18. The newspaper said the couple
is expected to leave the following day, the duchess by plane and
the duke aboard the ship, arriving home Dec. 16.

   U.N. peacekeeping troops from the
Iran-Iraq border to this war-divided island celebrated their Nobel
Peace Prize on Thursday with champagne and a renewed spirit that
their missions are important.
   ``We are here to keep the peace, but winning the Nobel prize
makes you feel good,'' said Canadian Trooper Tony Mayfield, 22.
   He and Grant Townsend, 22, also of Canada, guarded a crossing
point linking the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors of Nicosia.
   The 2,000-strong peace force in Cyprus has been maintaining the
peace since clashes between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities first broke out in 1964.
   ``The Nobel is a feather in the United Nations' cap. It gives us
an incentive to continue,'' Mayfield said.
   Peacekeepers in Jerusalem popped open bottles of champagne as
the word was passed by radio from outpost to outpost.
   Five of the seven U.N. peacekeeping forces worldwide are
stationed in the Middle East _ Cyprus, southern Lebanon, Israel's
northern and southern borders, Syria's Golan Heights and the
Iran-Iraq border.
   The others are along the India-Pakistan border and in
Afghanistan.
   Spokesmen said the prize was a tribute to the thousands who
serve in difficult conditions. Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers wear the
blue beret that has come to symbolize the U.N.'s role in monitoring
truces and trying to prevent bloodshhed.
   ``The Nobel Committee recognizes that the quest for peace is a
universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the
world,'' said Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Pvt. Mike Mahony, 26, of Cork, Ireland, said he hoped the award
would make UNIFIL's job easier in Lebanon. ``I feel proud. I
suppose we'll get more respect now,'' Mahony said in a telephone
interview.
   ``It is a very happy occasion that our work is appreciated. It
is always good news when people say you are doing good work,'' said
Major J.H. Buhl of the 340-member Danish contingent on Cyprus.
   A duty officer from Bangladesh at the headquarters of the nearly
2-month-old U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group heard the news
from a reporter.
   ``It is exciting,'' said the officer, who refused to give his
name. He said the men at the front ``will know that their job is
worth doing.''
   Timor Goksel, UNIFIL spokesman in Lebanon, said, ``The
international community has finally given appropriate recognition
to all the sacrifices our people have made.''
   Lt. Gen. Martin Vadset, chief of staff of the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization in Jerusalem, said the award recognized
the U.N. peacekeepers' success in preventing conflicts from
escalating.
   ``We have lived through all the wars you can think of and one
might say that we have been unsuccessful in preventing them,'' said
Vadset, a Norwegian. ``But we have been successful in being
available to minimize disaster when it first broke out.''
   ``I think the committee chose exactly the right time'' to give
the prize to the peacekeepers, said Brian Urquhart, the British
U.N. undersecretary who set up the peace forces until he retired in
1985.
   U.N. peacekeeping officials in Finland, which contributes more
troops than any other country, said they hoped the Nobel Peace
Prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially
ailing forces.
   The United Nations is in arrears in payments to countries which
provide soldiers for the peacekeeping forces. It owes Finland $22.5
million.

   Here is the announcement by the Nobel
Committee on Thursday that the U.N. peacekeeping troops won the
1988 Nobel Peace Prize. This is the committee's official
English-language version.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the 1988 Nobel
Peace Prize is to be awarded to the United Nations peacekeeping
forces.
   The peacekeeping forces of the United Nations have under
extremely difficult conditions contributed to reducing tensions
where an armistice has been negotiatied but a peace treaty has yet
to be established.
   In situations of this kind the U.N. forces represent the
manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through
negotiations, and the forces have by their presence made a decisive
contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations.
   It is the considered opinion of the committee that the
peacekeeping forces through their efforts have made important
contributions towards the realization of one of the fundamental
tenets of the United Nations.
   Thus the world organization has come to play a more central part
in world affairs and has been invested with increasing trust.
   The peacekeeping forces are recruited from among the young
people of many nations, who, in keeping with their ideals,
voluntarily take on a demanding and hazardous service in the cause
of peace.
   In the opinion of the committee their efforts contribute in a
particularly appropriate way towards the realization of the goals
of the United Nations.

<TEXT>
   Thirty-two months of anxiety and
frustration burst into exuberance _ and relief _ as the space
shuttle Discovery roared away Thursday and broke through a cloud of
doubt over space workers across the country.
   ``This is a very, very special mission to us all,'' said John
Kaltenbach, an 18-year NASA employee who watched at Johnson Space
Center in Houston as a senior advance system specialist for
Lockheed Corp. ``There was probably more apprehension and
excitement in this one. This one had to fly.
   ``Relief ... absolute relief. It feels so good,'' Kaltenbach
exulted.
   John Hotz, who covered the early days of the U.S. space program
for Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine and later served on
the presidential commission that investigated the Challenger
disaster, said: ``This is about as emotional a flight as I ever
witnessed.
   ``I didn't cheer, I yelled. I'm still trying to get everything
under control,'' Hotz said.
   J.R. Thompson, director of the Marshall Space Center, broke out
a foot-long Royal Jamaica cigar to celebrate. Inside the Kennedy
Space Center control room, he said, there was a progression of
smiles, thumbs-up signs, cheers and finally, ``a roar,'' as the
Discovery passed each of its initial post-launch tests.
   Outside the neighboring Vehicle Assembly Building here, hundreds
of workers left their stations inside to whoop and cheer along with
the launch that allowed them to again look ahead to a more-stable
space program than the revisions, layoffs, firings and uncertainty
that followed the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion.
   ``Unique, super, great! All those good words,'' Forrest
McCartney, Kennedy Space Center director, said as he slapped backs
and grabbed hands to shake.
   ``It's an indescribable boost to morale,'' McCartney said. ``The
sole job of these people is to do what they did today. It's been a
very long time for them. This was their living, their masterpiece,
today.''
   ``Everybody's going out to buy a house now,'' said a security
guard as the workers shook hands and began laughing on their way
back to work.
   At the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., space
workers wearing the green ribbons and clothes symbolizing ``Go''
for Discovery prayed, clapped, then cheered. As at other space
centers, many sported the ``Back to the Future'' buttons with the
unofficial theme for the Discovery mission.
   ``My feeling came at 8{ minutes when the engines went off,''
said Jerry Cox, a senior engineer who worked on the shuttle's main
engine. ``I've been involved with that for 2{ years, and it was a
tremendous relief when that point came.''
   In Brigham City, Utah, a tearful Mayor Peter Knudson called the
launch ``one of the greatest moments of my life.''
   Utah is home to some 8,000 employees of Morton Thiokol,
designers of the 126-foot solid rocket boosters. A faulty joint
seal on a Challenger booster was blamed for the explosion.
   Unlike for the first manned spaceflights and the Apollo
moonflights he observed as a reporter, Hotz was here watching to
see how NASA had reacted to the sharp criticism of the Rogers
Commission he belonged to. The late-morning delay while some
unusual wind conditions were studied were part of the new caution
of a more-humble NASA, he said.
   ``I'm very pleased with NASA. They really took the lesson of
Challenger to heart,'' Hotz said.
   Some former NASA employees said the launch was long overdue.
   ``I think it was real important to get back in space again,''
said Sam Beddingfield, a retired NASA manager who now has a private
space consulting firm. ``I'm disappointed that it took so long. Now
they can get going again.''
   At the Kennedy Space Center, Larry Kuznetz remained cynical
about the space program's future because of political vagaries.
   ``The problem is we don't have a commitment to space,'' said
Kuznetz, involved in thermal tile development, spacesuit testing
and other aspects of the shuttle mission before he left NASA in
1984. Now a teacher for the Boston-based International Space
University, which seeks international cooperation in space research
and study, Kuznetz said the class he taught at University of
California-Berkeley built a fullscale replica of the Challenger in
the two years after the tragedy.
   ``I was drawn back here like a magnet,'' he said.
   ``After the panic, the witchhunt, the finger-pointing, I think
this will be very good,'' Kuznetz said, adding quietly: ``This kind
of closes a loop.''

<HEAD>House Approves $14.3 Billion Foreign Aid Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House adopted and sent to the Senate
Thursday a compromise $14.3 billion foreign aid bill that shifts
emphasis to grants, rather than loans, for U.S. military assistance
to friendly countries. The vote was 327-92.
   House and Senate negotiators, in an all-night session last week,
set up a program for overseas arms sales that will provide $3.8
billion in outright grants and $410 million in loans made on
favorable terms during the fiscal year that begins Saturday.
   The agreement also retained the current Military Assistance
Program, with grants in fiscal 1989 totaling $467 million.
   As ususal, the largest recipients of military and economic aid
are Israel and Egypt, which receive hefty support because of their
1979 peace treaty. Israel would get $1.2 billion in economic and
$1.8 billion in military assistance, while Egypt would get $815
million in economic aid and $1.2 billion in military aid. All of
the military aid for both would be in the form of grants.
   The foreign aid bill has been remarkably without controversy
this year, in part because of last year's agreement between the
Reagan administration and Congress that smoothed the way for the
year's money bills.
   If given final Senate approval and sent to President Reagan, it
would be the first time in seven years that a separate foreign aid
bill has been approved. Usually, the measure has been rolled into
catch-all spending bills in Congress' rush to adjourn. The Reagan
administration has indicated its support for this year's compromise
measure.
   In one provision that briefly threatened to undo the compromise,
the bill would provide $50 million as the first of six yearly
installments toward recapitalizing the World Bank, which makes
loans to developing countries.
   House members had objected to the provision on Wednesday,
delaying the measure by a day. Opponents argue that increasing
loans to third-world countries without first demanding economic
reforms is counterproductive, and some conservatives oppose the
bank because they say it makes loans to communist countries. But
the money ultimately was left in the bill as part of the overall
compromise on a vote of 303-90.
   Among other provisions in the bill:
   _ $2 million for internal opposition parties in Nicaragua, to be
provided through the National Endowment for Democracy. The money
cannot go to any group that supports the Contra rebels or other
armed opponents of the leftist Sandinistat regime. The amount is an
increase from this year's $800,000, and is to go for union
organizing, buying supplies for opposition media and political
training.
   _ $101 million for international narcotics control programs run
by the State Department, a $2 million increase from the current
fiscal year. The increase is to fund drug eradication and
interdiction efforts, particularly aerial herbicide spraying of
coca plants.
   _ $35 million for Jamaica, for use in recovery from damage
caused by Hurricane Gilbert earlier this month.
   Other major aid allocations include the Philippines, which would
get $125 million in military aid, $124 million in economic aid and
$40 million for development; an African development fund, which
would get $500 million; $500 million in military aid and $60
million in economic aid for Turkey; and $350 million in military
aid for Greece.
   In Central America, El Salvador would receive $185 million in
economic support, Guatemala $80 million, Costa Rica $90 million,
and Honduras $85 million. Guatemala also would get $9 million in
``non-lethal'' military support to help its civilian government
eliminate human rights abuses and assert control over the military.
The bill also would continue bans on aid to Panama and Haiti.
   The bill includes $215 million in economic and $230 million in
military aid for Pakistan; $43 million to aid Afghan refugees; $2
million for the Polish trade union Solidarity; at least $10 million
for Ireland; $30 million in military aid and $11 million in
economic aid for Tunisia; and $50 million in economic aid for
Portugal.

   The Soviet Union released the first photos of its
secret space shuttle Thursday in a move that appeared timed to
steal some of the thunder from the launch of Discovery.
   Photos of the Soviet craft, which looks just like the American
shuttle, moved on the wires of the official Tass news agency at
about the time the Discovery was scheduled to blast off from Cape
Canaveral.
   Along with the photos of the Soviet craft, the agency
transmitted a brief dispatch on the American launch.
   The Soviet shuttle previously was not shown to the Soviet or
foreign public, although some Western reconnaissance photographs of
the craft or mockup versions have been taken.
   The Tass photos showed the Soviet spacecraft against a twilight
sky, with its black-tipped white wings and fuselage. The letters
``CCCP'' _ Russian for U.S.S.R. _ were written in red on one wing.
   State-run Soviet television did not broadcast the Discovery
launch live, but showed only a film clip of the American craft
sitting on the launch pad in darkness. An announcer read a report
on the blastoff during a regularly scheduled newscast a few minutes
later.
   The evening television news program Vremya, which is watched by
millions of Soviets, showed still pictures of the Soviet shuttle as
its third item and said that ground tests of its equipment were
continuing. It showed film of the Discovery launch about 20 minutes
later.
   Radio Moscow's international newscast also juxtaposed reports
about the U.S. takeoff with updates on the Soviet space station Mir
_ meaning both Earth and Peace _ with three cosmonauts aboard.
   Despite repeated comments by Soviet officials that their shuttle
has a distinct design and capabilities, the Tass photographs
indicated it was quite similar to the American version. The Soviet
shuttle, under development since at least 1982, has delta-shaped
wings like its American counterpart, and is mated to its booster
rocket, the Energia, in a similar way as the American craft.
   Mir was pictured in front of the huge Energia booster, which can
carry payloads of up to 100 tons _ much more than the American
shuttle.
   In the photos, the booster and shuttle stood upright on tarmac,
apparently at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Soviet Central Asia, but
it was not clear if it was stationed at a launchpad.
   Soviet officials have said their shuttle will be launched by the
end of 1988, but have not given an exact date. They have
acknowledged technical problems are causing delays.
   They also point to the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the U.S.
shuttle Challenger, which caused a 2{-year suspension in the U.S.
manned space program, as an example of the hazards they are trying
to prevent. The Soviet shuttle's first flight is to be unmanned.
   The Energia booster has been tested once, on May 15, 1987, when
it successfully carried aloft a dummy spacecraft.
   Soviet program also has had difficulties this month. Soviet
officials said they have lost radio contact with one of two Mars
probes launched in July. In addition, the re-entry to Earth of a
Soviet and an Afghan cosmonaut aboard a space capsule that docked
with Mir nearly failed because of equipment problems and human
error.
   The Soviets' main goal has been to maintain a continuous manned
presence in space. Cosmonaut crews have been aboard the orbiting
space station Mir without a break since February 1987.
   Yuri Romanenko set a space endurance record last year by staying
in space 326 days, and officials have said they expect the two
cosmonauts currently aboard the craft to break Romanenko's record.

<HEAD>Stakes High As Bentsen, Quayle Hit Briefing Books</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen turn their
attention to debate briefing books, experts predict their showdown
next week could be the most important ever between two men vying
for the vice presidency.
   The pressure is on both candidates next Wednesday night in
Omaha, largely because of the controversy surrounding Quayle's
National Guard stint at the height of the Vietnam War and his
admission to law school.
   ``This debate could be decisive in the election. And never
before could you say that about a vice presidential debate,'' said
Joel L. Swerdlow, who edited a volume on presidential debates and
has written extensively on the subject.
   ``This is the first time in modern history that a vice
presidential candidate may fail to pass the threshold of
acceptability,'' said Kathleen Jamieson of the University of Texas,
an expert on politics and the media.
   Quayle spent Thursday in briefings here and looked ahead to a
weekend of tutelage from Roger Ailes, the Bush campaign's media
guru. Bentsen snatched time to study during a light campaign
schedule before returning here late Friday for two days with top
Democratic advisers.
   The nation has seen only two vice presidential debates:
Republican Bob Dole vs. Democrat Walter Mondale in 1976 and
Republican George Bush vs. Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
   Although Mondale and Bush were considered victors in those
contests, ``Dole passed the threshold of acceptability and for most
people so did Ferraro,'' said Jamieson. Quayle, however, is a
question mark to a large number of voters, she said.
   ``The stakes are very high for Quayle,'' she said.
   Both Jamieson and Swerdlow said Quayle's performance is
particularly important because his choice has been linked so
closely to Bush's judgment.
   ``He could cost Bush a close election,'' Jamieson said.
   Much has been said and written about the low expectations for
Quayle, and how that might be an advantage for him in the debate.
   ``If he can appear the equal of Lloyd Bentsen, he'll score an
overwhelming victory,'' said Jamieson.
   But low expectations can also hurt.
   ``People will be disposed to hear errors as errors,'' unlike
minor flubs forgiven in last Sunday's debate between Bush and
Michael Dukakis, Jamieson said. Debates tend to reinforce views of
a candidate that people already have, and in Quayle's case ``a
stumbling performance will not be forgiven,'' she said.
   Bentsen, on the other hand, has the burden of showing himself of
presidential timber while not talking down to Quayle, and at the
same time trying to score hits against Bush.
   ``You can't make fun of someone'' and the standard Bentsen
one-liners from the campaign trail won't work in a debate, said
Swerdlow.
   With an eye toward the debate, the Bush campaign tried this week
to display confidence in Quayle, including a joint appearance by
the two Republicans.
   ``He's been accused of lacking in every skill, social and
otherwise. But he's a good campaigner and we expect him to do well
in the debate,'' said Sheila Tate, Bush's spokeswoman. Bentsen
``has to defend Quayle's position because most of them are his own.
I think he will squirm,'' she said, a reference to Bentsen's many
differences with Dukakis on the issues.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said Quayle will pursue the
Republican argument that Bentsen is more attuned to GOP attitudes
than those of Dukakis.
   ``Quayle is going to go after the top of the ticket. The fact
that Bentsen is more closely aligned with our ticket doesn't
hurt,'' he said.
   The Texas senator this week unleashed his harshest attacks yet
on his junior colleague from Indiana. ``I'll tell you, if they were
elected, I'd pray for the good health of George Bush every night,''
Bentsen said Wednesday.
   Bentsen's chief of staff, Joseph O'Neill, said Bentsen will try
to tie Quayle closely to Bush to show ``that our team is better
than their team.''
   Privately, Bentsen's aides say they're worried Bentsen, 67, will
look and sound old when put next to Quayle, who is 26 years younger.
   Both sides have viewed tapes of an April 22 broadcast of public
television's MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour, on which Bentsen and Quayle
debated the issue of giving workers 60 days' notice before a plant
could be closed.
   Quayle eventually lost the battle on the Senate floor, but on
television he presented his case attractively while Bentsen looked
gray.
   While Quayle plans to work this weekend with Ailes, Bentsen has
been working with Michael Sheehan, a consultant who specializes in
making candidates look good on television.
   Bentsen returns to Washington Friday for two days of meetings
and briefings. He travels Sunday back to Texas for final
preparations, including mock debates with Democratic Rep. Dennis
Eckart of Ohio playing Quayle.
   Top Republicans including Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin and
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger have already briefed
Quayle, who will remain in Washington until debate day except for a
Friday fund-raiser in Pennsylvania.
   In mock debates, Quayle is using Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, a
long-time colleague of Bentsen's on the Senate Finance Committee.

   Flags waved, cameras clicked and tears
flowed as a smaller-than-expected crowd of about 250,000 people
along Florida's Space Coast cheered the shuttle Discovery liftoff
late Thursday morning.
   ``Oh my gosh, it was great,'' said 11-year-old Tommy Mathis of
Detroit. ``It was neat watching ... it just looked like a ball of
fire at first going up. And it went into a cloud halfway up.
   ``As soon as it went out, it was beautiful,'' he said.
   Patricia Mathis, 33, his mother, said tears just streamed down
her face.
   ``I thought the most intense part was when they realized they
were past that Challenger stage.'' Challenger blew up 73 seconds
after launch on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its seven astronauts.
   The crowds turned out to be far smaller than the 1 million
authorities had been advised to prepare for. Mitch Varnes, a
spokesman for Kennedy Space Center, said reports of the large
crowds may have kept some away.
   But those who risked traffic jams and launch delays seemed more
than satisfied they came.
   ``There's an awful lot of people that this means a whole bunch
to that it didn't mean a thing two years ago,'' said Robert
Zsolczai, a butcher from Miami who has seen 16 shuttle launches. He
arrived Wednesday night but said he had a hard time settling to
sleep in his van, which was decorated with signs wishing NASA and
the Discovery crew good luck.
   ``Every 20 minutes you've got to look at it (the shuttle), make
sure it's there and all that,'' he said before launch. ``And I'm
not the only one. There's a lot of them that do that with
binoculars. They sit here all night. They know it's there but
you've got to keep reassuring yourself.''
   Many people were sleeping in cars parked along side U.S. 1 as
the sun rose Thursday. Lines grew long at restrooms at gas stations
and restaurants after they woke up.
   By midmorning, traffic in Titusville had slowed to a trickle as
attention turned eastward, toward the shuttle, which could be seen
across Indian River.
   Mette-Mari Wolden, 23, of Larvik, Norway, prolonged her stay in
the United States to see Discovery's launch. ``It will probably be
something I'll have a memory of for the rest of my life,'' she said.
   Woody Poynter, 32, of Sacramento, Calif., flew into Orlando
Wednesday, where he was unable to find a car to rent. The cab
driver who picked him up at the airport, however, offered to drive
him to Titusville when he came with his family.
   The crowds along the Indian River overlooking the space center
counted down the final few seconds with a NASA announcer heard on
radios and broke into shouts of encouragement as Discovery lifted
off.
   They quieted down when the spaceship disappeared behind a layer
of clouds, but the yells began again when it reappeared and became
louder when the crowds heard the announcement at 2 minutes, 4
seconds after launch that the boosters had separated. A booster
flaw was blamed for the Challenger accident.
   Moments later, the crowds began heading for their cars and home.
   Joan Heller, a spokeswoman for the Brevard County Sheriff's
office said shortly after launch that she guessed about a
quarter-million people were on hand, although no formal count is
attempted.
   ``It's about the same size or smaller than the first launch,
larger than the most recent launches, but not nearly as big as
anticipated,'' she said.
   No arrests, major traffic problems or health problems were
reported.
   Three U.S. senators and about 20 congressmen traveled from
Washington to watch the launch. Among them were the three lawmakers
who have flown in space: Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the first
American to orbit the Earth, and Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, and Rep.
Bill Nelson, D-Fla., both of whom have flown on shuttle flights.
   Some 2,000 government officials, dignitaries and other NASA
guests watched the launch at a VIP viewing site about 6{ miles away
from the launchpad. Actor John Travola, who said he'd love to go
into space, was among them.
   ``It's a frontier that has hope and future, and that's important
to all of us as a group,'' said Travolta, who said he is an avid
jet pilot.

   Only half the elementary and secondary school
students in this country take world history courses, according a
panel of scholars that said Thursday an educational ``crisis'' is
creating a nation of historical illiterates.
   And the little history that is taught often is ``seriously
inadequate,'' according to the Bradley Commission on History in
Schools.
   ``History should not just be a mad dash through the centuries
with teachers trying desperately to get to the 1980s before school
lets out in June,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, Mellon professor of
history and social sciences at Columbia University, and chairman of
the commission.
   ``If history is to be properly taught and understood, teachers
must have enough time to provide context for facts and training in
critical judgment based upon evidence,'' he said.
   The 17-member panel of university historians and public school
teachers released a report, ``Building a History Curriculum:
Guidelines for Teaching History in Schools,'' in which it urged
that history be required of all students whether or not they are
preparing for college.
   ``History is in crisis _ when half of our students do not study
any European history or world history, and one child in seven
doesn't study American history is it any wonder they don't know
what side Germany was on in World War II or know what we mean by
the Holocaust?'' Jackson told a news conference Thursday.
   The commission was created in 1987 in response to widespread
concern over ``the inadequacy, both in quantity and quality, of the
history taught in American elementary and secondary schools.''
   The report said the number of required courses in history had
declined while other social disciplines and new fields _ sex and
health education, driver education and computer education _
expanded their roles in the basic public school curriculum.
   It noted that four states require world history for high school
graduation, 12 states have an optional or combination world history
requirement, while 34 have no world history requirement and four
more have no U.S. history requirement. Although these courses may
be offered or required by local school districts, there are no
across-the-board state requirements.
   ``When we look at the level of debate in this (presidential)
campaign we can see one of the consequences of having a
historically illiterate public,'' said Diane Ravitch of Columbia
University. ``It's pointless to talk about `a New Deal Democrat'
when the public doesn't know what the New Deal was.''
   ``One of the major candidates is not quite sure when Pearl
Harbor was. At least he knows what Pearl Harbor was,'' she said.
   Ravitch outlined the commission's recommendation that social
studies in grades kindergarten through 6 be history-centered and
that local and state school districts require the study of history
during four of the six years in grades 7 through 12.
   Other recommendations included:
   _The inclusion of the historical experiences of women, racial
and ethnic minorities in Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe in
all curricula.
   _Elementary and secondary social studies curricula that provide
a core of history and geography.
   _Social studies teachers in middle and high schools must have
completed a substantial history program at the college or
university level.
   _University history departments should offer survey courses
featuring world history, Western civilizaton and American history.
   _Local school boards and supervisors should give teachers
authority to design their own courses and methods and teach from
their own individual strengths.
   _Textbook publishers should stop overloading their schoolbooks
with facts and go back to telling a good story, built around
questions that are meaningful to students.

   When Chief Buffalo called Chippewa
leaders to Madeline Island to sign a treaty 134 years ago Friday,
he wanted to make sure the tribe could stay near the island it
considered sacred, his great, great granddaughter said.
   ``Buffalo would not have signed a treaty if he had believed his
children and grandchildren could not enjoy the fruits of the
earth,'' said Victoria Gokee, a member of the Red Cliff Chippewa
band and a local Indian historian.
   But Chief Buffalo's wishes remain in dispute today.
   Indians claim in the Treaty of 1854, which ceded lands to the
federal government, they retained the rights to hunt, spear fish
and gather wild grain in northern Wisconsin.
   Federal courts agree, but how those rights are exercised is
undecided. A hearing on that issue is scheduled next month in U.S.
District Court in Madison.
   Some opponents of treaty rights have called for Congress to
abrogate the agreements, arguing the treaties are outdated and
unfair.
   Each spring, tensions over the treaty rise as Chippewas spear
walleyes prized by sportsmen.
   In an interview on the mainland, with Madeline Island in the
background, Gokee, 57, retold the story passed down from her
ancestors describing the gold and promises at the Treaty of 1854
signing. The treaty was the last in a series of agreements that the
Lake Superior band of Chippewa made with the federal government.
   More than 100 Indians rowed or took canoes or other boats to the
Lake Superior island where federal government agents met them with
barrels of whiskey and gold, Gokee said. Each Indian was supposed
to receive a cup of gold, she said.
   She said, according to her grandfather, the Indians never
received the gold.
   In Gokee's view, the anniversary of the signing is not much to
celebrate.
   ``We never were the ones who wanted a treaty and with every
treaty we lost something,'' she said.
   Fear of losing their proximity to Madeline Island was the reason
why Buffalo signed the 1854 treaty that promised reservations for
what are now 14 bands of the tribe that live in Wisconsin,
Minnesota and Michigan, she said.
   Then-President Zachary Taylor had issued an order for the
Chippewas to leave the land, despite earlier treaties that allowed
the Indians to remain on the land unless they misbehaved.
   ``Buffalo couldn't bear to leave the burial grounds'' on the
island, Gokee said.
   The island was also considered sacred by the tribe because of
Chippewa legends and the Medewin religion, she said.
   According to legend, a woman on the island had placed her baby
in a cradleboard on a tree and the child disappeared.
   ``They say ... he returned to the island as an old man years and
years later,'' Gokee said.
   The legend says the spirits taught the child the code of the
Medewin religion, which he then taught to the Indian people, Gokee
said.
   In another legend, the Chippewa tribe was supposed to be where a
shell-shaped light shone in the sky, she said. The light had been
with the tribe many, many years ago farther east, but it
disappeared and hardships followed, according to the legend.
   Tribal elders sent scouts to find it and the light's final
resting place was over Madeline Island, Gokee said.
   Some non-Indians living on the island still speak of the light
today, said Gokee. She said she has never seen it.

   Relieved members of Congress hailed the
successful launch of the space shuttle Discovery on Thursday as a
rebirth of the nation's exploration of space.
   Several senators watched the launch on television sets in the
Republican and Democratic cloakrooms, then walked to the floor to
applaud the achievement.
   ``After nearly three years of down time, after thousands of
design changes, the U.S. space shuttle Discovery has just blasted
off from Cape Canaveral, returning America to space,'' Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., said to a gallery filled with visitors.
   He praised the thousands of people involved in the work of
preparing Discovery for launch and said: ``Today their work for
America has succeeded.''
   ``The numbing tragedy of January 28, 1986 ... is still fresh in
ur minds and weighs heavily on our hearts,'' Heflin said in
referecne to the explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger
and killed its seven crew members.
   But he said the nation was right in refusing to be discouraged
by the accident, which had grounded the U.S. manned spaceflight
program.
   ``Not exploring the limitless bounds of space would constitute a
tragedy greater than the one we experienced in 1986,'' Heflin said.
``Space is the greatest adventure of our times, and any nation that
sees itself as a great leader cannot and must not ignore it.''
   ``We're back in space,'' said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
chairman of the Senate space committee that oversees the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``And more than anything else this reaffirms our commitment,''
he said. ``The commitment has been questioned for the last two
years. But now we're back, and with that commitment, we'll attract
the best and the brightest to the program.''
   Sen. Thad Cochran, D-Miss., said ``This is a day when we can all
take pride in our country.''
   ``It is a great day for the exploration of the universe,''
Heflin added.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas strode from the GOP
cloakroom minutes after the launch to report to Sen. Richard
Shelby, D-Ala., who was presiding.
   ``Straight up, about 100 miles up,'' Dole said with a grin.
   How long is the mission? Shelby asked.
   ``Four days, one hour,'' Dole replied.
   And then referring to Congress' struggle to adjourn for the
year, he added: ``They are going to stay up there until we leave.''

   More than 1,000 journalists at a
remote press site cheered Discovery's majestic liftoff Thursday,
but also expressed disappointment that new safety rules prevented
them from a closer view.
   ``Tremendous! It's more than I thought,'' said an excited James
Miller with a public television station in Houston, seconds after
viewing his first launch.
   Prompted by Air Force concerns that the Complex 39 press site
could be bombarded by falling debris if the solid rocket boosters
malfunctioned, only 1,800 reporters were allowed to work from the
main press site.
   The new rules forced Miller and other reporters to view the
liftoff at the alternate press site, more than six miles away from
the from Discovery's launchpad.
   Despite the spectacular liftoff, reporters at the remote site
were envious of their colleagues who viewed the launch from only
four miles away and expressed fears that additional restrictions
may follow.
   ``I hope this is not indicative of a trend,'' said Miller, who
called the new measures ``indirect censorship.''
   ``I still wish I was over there (main press site). It was still
a thrill. I'm glad nothing happened,'' said Lynn Occhiuzzo of the
Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel.
   Most of the journalists arrived at the mosquito-infested site
before dawn after driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic for up to two
hours from Titusville and Cocoa Beach.
   While awaiting the liftoff, journalists slept, and chatted.
   David Hartman, former host of ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
passed a football to his sons as he awaited the liftoff.
   Reporters complained the lack of telephones, electricity and
work space limited their usefulness at the remote site.
   ``There is no way to get a story filed in a timely manner,''
said Beverly Keneagy of The Florida Times-Union of Jacksonville.
Daily newspapers were allowed to have just two people at the main
press site.

<TEXT>
   The ``market stabilization price'' of raw cane
sugar in the 1989 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 will be up
slightly to 21.8 cents per pound, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   Acting Underscretary Richard W. Goldberg said the new rate
compares with 21.76 cents per pound in the current year.
   The MSP, as it is called, is a market price objective, a
computed level at or above which producers would be more likely to
repay price support loans and sell their sugar in the marketplace.
If market prices are below the MSP, producers are inclined to
forfeit their sugar to the government instead of paying off their
price support loans.
   Included in the computation for the MSP is the government's
price support loan rate of 18 cents per pound, plus allowances for
transportation costs and interests on loans to make the total of
21.8 cents per pound.

   Soldiers on the front lines of the United
Nations' 40- year quest for peace won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize on
Thursday for steadfast duty in the cross fire of the world's
conflicts.
   The Nobel Committee said the U.N. peacekeeping troops built
greater faith in the United Nations, which ``has come to play a
more central part in world affairs.''
   U.N. leaders praised the award but appealed again for the
release of a U.S. Marine kidnapped while serving with U.N.
peacekeepers in Lebanon.
   The award could bolster new U.N. peacemaking efforts to oversee
shaky truce agreements in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan.
   In Jerusalem, peacekeepers broke open bottles of champagne to
celebrate the prestigious award as the word was passed by radio
from outpost to outpost. Five of the seven peacekeeping forces are
in the Middle East.
   ``We are here to keep the peace, but winning the Nobel prize
makes you feel good,'' said Canadian trooper Tony Mayfield, 22, who
guards a crossing point between Greek and Turkish sectors of
Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus.
   Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from more than 30 countries serve
under the U.N. flag. Peacekeepers most recently were dispatched to
Iran and Iraq under a cease-fire negotiated in the countries'
8-year-long war.
   ``There is great joy,'' said Timor Goskel, spokesman for the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. He spoke from UNIFIL headquarters in
Naqoura, Lebanon.
   The citation from the Nobel Committee, made up of five
Norwegians, said the troops showed the world's determination to
settle disputes peacefully. It said they ``made a decisive
contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations.''
   Some peacekeepers carry light arms, but they can fire only in
self-defense. The United Nations says 733 peacekeepers have lost
their lives since 1948.
   Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who headed the 76-member U.N.
supervision group in south Lebanon, is among nine American hostages
in Lebanon. Higgins, 43, was seized Feb. 17.
   ``For us, it is a No. 1 priority that this officer who was
serving the United Nations, who was wearing the blue beret when he
was kidnapped, should be released without delay,'' said U.N.
Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding.
   The prize was an indirect tribute to Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who was not eligible because he was nominated
after the Feb. 1 deadline.
   Perez de Cuellar, speaking to applause at the U.N. General
Assembly in New York, said the Nobel committee showed ``that the
quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the
nations and peoples of the world.''
   The U.N. chief said he would accept the prize in Oslo on Dec.
10, the anniversary of benefactor Alfred Nobel's death in 1896.
Nobel was the inventor of dynamite.
   The prize carries a cash award of 2.5 million Swedish kronor,
worth $390,000 today.
   U.N. officials did not say how the money would be used. The
peacekeeping operations cost about $230 million a year, and
officials say that likely additional operations in southern Africa,
Western Sahara and Cambodia will raise the total to $1.5 billion to
$2 billion annually.
   Committee chairman Egil Aarvik confirmed that President Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev were among the 97 candidates
and were ``seriously considered'' for the prize.
   He did not explain the committee's decision. But he said when
asked if the presidential election was a factor: ``Yes, we take
everything into consideration, also that.''
   Reagan congratulated the peacekeeping forces.
   ``No, I didn't deserve it as much (as they did),'' Reagan told
reporters at the White House. ``It was an admirable decision.''
   Reagan and Gorbachev were nominated for signing a treaty to
dismantle land-based intermediate-range missiles, the first accord
to reduce the superpowers' nuclear arsenals.
   Aarvik told reporters he hoped the prize would ``give the U.N.
and the forces increased prestige.''
   The award reflected a trend adopted by the committee of trying
to use the coveted prize to influence events.
   Last year the panel made no secret that it wanted to encourage
the Central American peace process by giving the prize to Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias.
   The award comes at a time of growing respectibility but mounting
financial difficulty for the United Nations, despite Reagan's
decision to lift a suspension of more than $500 million the United
States owed in dues.
   In Scandinavia alone, the U.N. forces are in arrears to Norway
for $36 million and to Finland for $22.5 million. Sweden pulled out
of the Cyprus peace force last year to protest the U.N.'s failure
to pay for the troops, but stayed in other forces.
   It was the fifth time that a U.N.-related body won the peace
prize since it was first awarded in 1901. It also was the 16th time
that an organization rather than a person has won the prize.
Previous winners included the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
Amnesty International and the Red Cross.
   The Nobel prizes for medicine, economics, physics and chemistry
are to be announced next month in Stockholm, Sweden.

   ``There's no place like home,'' said
Dorothy in the ``Wizard of Oz.'' But where's home?
   Not Kansas, says a Chesterton town board, which believes Dorothy
would rather have been a Hoosier.
   The town board has launched a tongue-in-cheek custody battle
with Kansas over Dorothy.
   The board passed a resolution declaring Chesterton, home of one
of the nation's largest Wizard of Oz festivals, as the hometown of
Oz heroine Dorothy Gale.
   Jean Nelson, founder of the Chesterton Oz Festival, gathered 336
signatures on a petition in favor of the resolution, approved
Monday.
   Ms. Nelson, who owns the Yellow Brick Road shop, said she
decided to push for custody of Dorothy after some Kansas officials
said they were shunning Oz publicity because the movie does not
promote Kansas in a favorable light.
   Sonya Woertz, a spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of
Commerce, said the objections arise from scenes in the MGM movie
that portray Dorothy as bored with life in dreary, flat Kansas.
   ``We decided since Dorothy has been trying to go home for the
last 49 years, and since Kansas doesn't want her, we decided to
make her a Hoosier,'' Ms. Nelson said Thursday.
   A copy of the resolution will be forwarded to Kansas Gov. Mike
Hayden.

   Artists upset with a pumpkin
festival have found a way to fight back _ with a squash fete.
   Katie Murdoch and other local artists are angry that
out-of-towners have taken over the 18th Annual Half Moon Bay Art
and Pumpkin Festival. The sponsors include Safeway, Chevrolet,
Budweiser and General Foods.
   ``The pumpkin festival has taken on a corporate life of its
own,'' said Murdoch, a history teacher.
   So, she organized the First Annual Squash Festival.
   The pumpkin festival attracts more than 300,000 people during
its weekend run in mid-October. The main attraction are works of
art made from pumpkins.
   The squash festival will feature 30 local artists displaying
everything from landscape paintings to kelp baskets and something
known as a ``fish print,'' images made from living fish.
   The festivals will go head-to-head. Both are set for the Oct.
15-16 weekend.

<HEAD>Easing of Emigration Restrictions Planned, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials have informed the United
States they plan to ease restrictions that prevent many Soviet
citizens from emigrating, the State Department said Thursday.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the Soviets spelled out their
position last week in two days of talks during the visit here of
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``We welcome the reform process under way in the Soviet Union,''
Mrs. Oakley said, noting that the Soviets promised to allow free
emigration in a 1975 agreement.
   She added, however, with even with these changes, not all
individuals will be able to exercise their right to leave the
Soviet Union.
   She said the United States will continue to urge the Soviets to
uphold their commitments.
   According to U.S. estimates, Soviet Jews have been emigrating at
the rate of 2,000 per month this year and the total for 1988 could
be the highest since 51,000 emigrated in 1979.
   American officials, insisting on anonymity, said the Soviets
plan to repeal a requirement that Soviet citizens receive an
invitation to leave from close family members living abroad as a
condition for their departure.
   Another proposal would waive the current requirement that a
child receive parental approval to leave the country, the officials
said.

<HEAD>Hospitalization Goes Down This Decade For Four Cancers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials said Thursday that
hospitalization rates have fallen in the 1980s for four major types
of cancer, even though the number of people suffering from the
diseases has not fallen in all cases.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported that
hospitalization rates for breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and
rectal cancer, and cervical cancer all have declined during the
decade. The rates are calculated by looking at records of hospital
discharges.
   Hospitalization rates do not necessarily reflect trends in the
numbers of people with various cancers, said Dr. James Mendlein, a
CDC researcher. Some cancers may require more follow-up hospital
stays than others, and the effort to cut the cost of health care
also can influence the number of times a patient is hospitalized,
he noted.
   ``This gives you just one measure of the health care impact (of
various cancers),'' Mendlein said.
   The drop in hospitalization rates parallels the drop in the rate
of occurrence of cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and male lung
cancer, Mendlein said. On the other hand, while hospitalizations
for breast cancer and female lung cancer are declining somewhat,
the incidence of those two diseases continues to increase, he said.
   For 1986, the latest year for which figures are available, the
CDC estimates hospital discharge rates as:
   _Breast cancer, 172 per 100,000 people, down from a peak of 199
in 1983.
   _Lung cancer, male, 142 per 100,000, down from a peak of 182 in
1984.
   _Lung cancer, female, 83 per 100,000, down from a peak of 100 in
1983.
   _Colorectal cancer, 86 per 100,000, down from a peak of 92 in
1981.
   _Cervical cancer, 46 per 100,000, down from a peak of 89 in 1976.
   A National Cancer Institute report earlier this year put breast
cancer at its highest rate in history, and it is still the leading
cause of cancer death among women. Lung cancer, the leading cause
of cancer deaths overall, is increasing among women and decreasing
among men.
   When studying hospital discharge rates, ``incidence or
occurrence is just one of the forces,'' Mendlein said. ``There are
other, economic forces as well.''
   He noted that such factors as shifts in Medicare policy and
trends in outpatient treatment could change the rates of hospital
visits for various diseases.

<TEXT>
   NASA launch supervisors met Thursday
morning to consider the effect of lighter-than-normal winds and
chose to waive agency guidelines that would have prohibited the
space shuttle's late-morning liftoff.
   ``The winds did not violate our safety factor,'' said Thomas
Utsman, deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center. Nonetheless,
he confirmed, ``It did require a waiver'' of launch rules.
   ``It wasn't taken lightly,'' he said. ``It was not a result of a
judgment, but a refined engineering analysis.''
   Robert Crippen, the veteran astronaut who heads a new launch
oversight team, convened his unit to consider the waiver, officials
said. Waivers are controversial because investigations of the
Challenger disaster indicated that officials had granted waivers
that allowed the flawed booster rockets to continue flying without
redesign.
   Thursday's dilemma arose because weather officers expected a
shuttle to hit autumn headwinds of nearly 100 miles an hour between
20,000 and 50,000 feet as it climbed to orbit.
   Spacecraft computers were programmed to permit the shuttle to
operate in this environment, responding to the winds with
spacecraft changes designed to keep the ship safe and on course.
   But weather balloons launched Wednesday indicated y were coming from,
combined with
the computer program, could cause damage to tiles on the leading
edge of Discovery's wings.
   A computer program devised for spring-season flights would have
provided data to compensate for the light winds, officials said.
   It was too late to change the computer program for a launch on
Thursday, so engineers worked through the night to reconsider the
wind rules they had set for Discovery's launch. It's something
engineers call a model.
   ``Our model was very conservative,'' said Utsman. ``We were able
to refine our model and found we have 4 to 5 percent more
structural margin.''
   That, he said, would provide enough of a safety margin for
Discovery's computer if the winds would just shift to a more
westerly direction.
   But a balloon dispatched early today indicated the wind was
still from the northeast, unacceptable for launch. Another balloon
two hours later showed a gradual shift to the northwest, and a
slight decrease in velocity, moves that continued through
subsequent balloon flights.
   Utsman said the combination of reduced winds and their shift in
direction enabled engineers to feel comfortable they could launch
under terms of the new model. Launch was delayed 98 minutes, but
took place at 11:37 a.m. EDT.

   U.N. leaders praised the organization's
peacekeeping forces after they won the Nobel Peace Prize on
Thursday, but they pleaded for a U.S. Marine kidnapped while
serving with a U.N. group in Lebanon.
   ``For us, it is a No. 1 priority that this officer who was
serving the United Nations, who was wearing the blue beret when he
was kidnapped, should be released without delay,'' said Marrack
Goulding, who leads the peacekeepers as U.N. undersecretary for
political affairs.
   Lt. Col. William R. Higgins commanded a 76-man group attached to
the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon when he was abducted Feb. 17.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
responsibility and said Higgins would be put on trial for spying.
U.S. and U.N. sources deny Higgins was a spy.
   ``He was one of those unarmed observers attached to UNIFIL in
southern Lebanon. I would like to take this opportunity to repeat
an appeal, which has been made so often in the past, to those who
are holding him to release him without delay,'' said Goulding.
   Goulding's call for Higgins' release was the only somber note at
the United Nations.
   ``Everybody from the 38th floor to the basement is delighted''
that the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to U.N.
peacekeepers worldwide, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani.
   Goulding had no comment on how the $390,000 prize will be used.
   If the prize money is donated to U.N. peacekeeping budgets, it
won't make much of a dent in the peacekeeping deficits.
   On Aug. 31, U.N. documents show that members owed $325 million
to the U.N. Interim Force In Lebanon and owed the U.N.
Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan Heights and the U.N.
Emergency Force between Egypt and Israel $45 million.
   Members also owed the U.N. force in Cyprus $158.1 million by the
end of July, said Goulding.
   He estimated 400,000 to 500,000 people have worn the blue helmet
or beret of the U.N. peacekeeping force, and said 9,991 soldiers
now are in the force, supported by about 2,000 civilian personnel.
All were honored by the award.
   ``In awarding the Peace Prize to the peacekeeping forces of the
United Nations today, the Nobel Committee recognizes that the quest
for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and
peoples of the world,'' Perez de Cuellar said in a statement to the
General Assembly.
   Brian Urquhart, the former undersecretary-general in charge of
U.N. peacekeeping who retired in 1986, said the award honors the
733 soldiers who died on observer missions.
   ``But it is also a recognition of this important pioneering
concept, which uses military personnel in a non-violent role to
promote peace, an idea whose time has come and will go far,'' he
said.
   Perez de Cuellar has invited Urquhart and Goulding to accompany
him to Oslo, Norway, to accept the prize Dec. 10 on behalf of the
peacekeepers, said Giuliani.
   Goulding said Perez de Cuellar is making ``continuous and
vigorous efforts with all those who may have influence with those
who are holding Col. Higgins to get him released,'' he added.
   In a separate interview, the chief U.S. representative to the
world body, Vernon A. Walters, also recalled Higgins.
   ``Let us never forget that among those peacekeeping forces that
received the Nobel Peace Prize is Lt. Col. Higgins, and he is
hostage today, and whose liberation we expect,'' Walters said.

<HEAD>Spain Keeps Detective From Testifying In IRA Inquest, Witness Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish authorities are preventing a police
detective from testifying about three IRA guerrillas he trailed
through Spain before they came to Gibraltar, where British
commandos killed them, a witness said Wednesday.
   Gibraltar police Inspector Manolo Correa told an inquest that
the unidentified Spanish officer had sent him a statement
expressing a desire to testify about the March 6 slayings. But
Correa said the officer told him several days ago his superiors
would not let him testify.
   Spain maintains a long dispute with Britain for the return of
sovereignty over Gibraltar, a British colony at the southern tip of
Spain. It was ceded to Britain in 1713.
   News reports in Spain and Britain have indicated the Spanish
police kept the three IRA members under surveillance until they
crossed into the colony, hours before being shot.
   Correa's testimony came on the 17th day of an inquest by
Gibraltar Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-man jury into the
shooting deaths of Mairead Farrell, 31, Daniel McCann, 30, and Sean
Savage, 24.
   Pizarello, after hearing Correa's testimony, ordered that a new
effort be made to seek the Spanish lawman's testimony.
   The IRA has acknowledged the three victims were on ``active
service,'' meaning they were on a mission to strike at British
targets at the time of their deaths.
   British commandos have claimed that they killed the three
unarmed guerrillas because they feared the guerrillas were about to
detonate a radio-controlled bomb in a car parked about a mile away.
   The inquest has no power of prosecution but is to determine
whether the shootings were lawful.
   If the jury decides upon a verdict of unlawful killing, the
Gibraltar attorney general is expected to hand down criminal
indictments, Gibraltar sources said.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
have singled out the Gibraltar IRA shootings as evidence of an
unofficial government ``shoot-to-kill'' policy against the outlawed
Irish Republican Army.
   The predominately Roman Catholic IRA has carried out a violent
campaign to force the end of British rule in mainly Protestant
Northern Ireland. It sharply increased its attacks on British
soldiers after the Gibraltar slayings.

<TEXT>
   The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday
upheld John Wayne Gacy's 1980 convictions and death sentence in the
sex-related killings of 33 young men and boys, but prosecutors said
years of appeals remain likely.
   ``Gacy is not at the head of the line (for execution). I wish he
was,'' said Kevin Sweeney, chief of death-penalty litigation for
the Cook County state's attorney's office, who called Gacy ``the
best illustration of why we have the death penalty in Illinois.''
   Thursday's ruling, issued without written dissent, marked the
second time the state's highest court has turned down an appeal by
Gacy, convicted of more murders than anyone else in U.S. history.
   Unless the state justices agree to reconsider their ruling _ a
request that is rarely granted _ the 46-year-old Gacy has exhausted
his appeals in Illinois courts. However, he still can pursue a
lengthy appeals process in the federal courts.
   The latest court decision comes nearly a decade after the
gruesome discovery of 27 bodies of young men and boys in a crawl
space of Gacy's suburban Chicago home. Two more bodies were found
elsewhere on the property and four were recovered from nearby
rivers.
   The former contractor and amateur clown told police that he had
strangled all but one of his victims by wrapping rope around their
necks and twisting it with a stick, and that he had had sex with
some of his victims before killing them.
   Gacy was sentenced to death for 12 killings, and to life in
prison for the remaining 21. He also was convicted of deviate
sexual assault and taking indecent liberties with a child, but was
not sentenced on those charges.
   The convictions and death sentence were first affirmed by the
Illinois Supreme Court in June 1984, and the U.S. Supreme Court
refused to hear his appeal in March 1985. A Cook County circuit
judge refused to grant Gacy a new post-trial hearing in September
1986.
   In Thursday's ruling, the state Supreme Court rejected arguments
that defense testimony at Gacy's trial was improperly restricted,
and that his trial attorney failed to present evidence at a death
penalty hearing that might have spared Gacy from a death sentence.
   The court noted that while psychiatrists testifying for the
defense were not allowed to quote from statements by Gacy, they
were allowed to paraphrase statements on which they based their
conclusions.
   The justices also noted that mitigating evidence, such as Gacy's
warm relationship with his family and friends and his good behavior
in prison, had been presented at trial to the same jury that
imposed the death penalty.
   ``We believe that (defense) counsel could reasonably have
believed that jurors would not have been impressed, and might
actually have been irritated by a pointless rehash of the lengthy
testimony they had already heard at trial,'' Justice William Clark
wrote in the court's opinion.
   The court set a Jan. 11, 1989, execution date, which would be
extended by appeals. Gacy is one of more than 100 men on death row
in Illinois, which has not conducted an execution since 1962.

<HEAD>Wright Claims Republican Vendetta, But GOP Says He's Ducking Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   House Speaker Jim Wright accused Republicans
on Thursday of carrying out a political vendetta against him, but
the minority countered that Wright was simply trying to duck
charges that he improperly disclosed classified information.
   The comments came as angry personal charges flew back and forth
between leadership figures of both sides of the political aisle.
   ``I've never seen this thing get out of control like it is
now,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho, the Democrats' No. 3 leadership
official in the chamber. Coelho accused GOP leaders of trying to
``tear down the institution'' and of caving in to right-wing
elements of their party who seek to embarrass Wright.
   ``The relationship between the parties is very strained,''
agreed Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming, the chamber's third-ranking
Republican. He said exchanges were far more acerbic than normal.
   Wright, D-Texas, told reporters that GOP efforts to have the
ethics committee investigate whether he violated House rules by
talking publicly last week about a CIA covert action in Nicaragua
are groundless and motivated by politics.
   ``It is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics
committee, or any other committee of the House, as a cat's paw to
try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another
member,'' he said.
   ``I can take it,'' Wright said. ``As speaker, I'm in the
kitchen, and I'm not offering to get out.''
   But Republicans called Democratic counteroffensive a dodge, and
said Wright simply was seeking to escape the consequences of his
mistake by stirring up a partisan smokescreen.
   ``The speaker's most recent transgressions have energized a lot
of us on our side,'' Cheney said. ``I don't think the House can
duck this. They (Democrats) know they've got a problem.''
   Some moderate Democrats were saying privately that while they
were proud of the legislative record of the 100th Congress under
Wright's leadership, they were uncomfortable with his highly
visible role in U.S. diplomacy toward Central America.
   That role assumed center stage again last week when Wright, in
response to a reporter's question, said he had ``clear testimony''
from the Central Intelligence Agency that U.S. agents had sought to
prompt civil unrest in Nicaragua to provoke a crackdown by the
leftist Sandinista government and scuttle peace talks.
   Cheney and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., quickly
asked for intelligence and ethics investigations of Wright to
determine whether he had violated House rules against disclosure of
classified material.
   Members in both parties saw the participation of Michel _ who
for years has taken a less confrontational tack in dealing with the
majority _ as a turning point in Democrat-Republican relations in
the chamber.
   The tensions surfaced on the House floor Thursday after one
Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pat Williams of Montana, denounced GOP
vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle for ``hypocrisy'' in voting
against the Job Corps, then telling Job Corps recruits at a Texas
campaign appearance that ``We believe in you.''
   Republican members bristled, and demanded that Williams be ruled
out of order. Williams then asked that his remarks be stricken from
the record, but in so doing repeated the hypocrisy charge at least
three times.
   Seeking to deal with the Wright controversy, the Intelligence
Committee met Wednesday and declined, on a party-line vote, to turn
over to the ethics committee relevant classified information.
Democrats reasoned that there was no obligation to do so because
the material had not yet been requested officially.
   In a statement issued Thursday, Michel said the lack of action
compelled him to ask Republican members of the Intelligence
Committee to prepare a confidential report to him outlining their
recommendations on what to do about the allegations concerning
Wright. He said that could lead to a request for unspecified action
by the full House ``to guarantee the integrity of House rules and
procedures.''
   Coelho, D-Calif., said the intelligence meeting was forced by
Republicans, who knew the panel would have to decline to release
the information.
   ``What you have now is an effort that's very political, very
aggressive and loaded with grenades,'' he said, attributing the
whole controversy to Republican frustration over being the minority
party in the House since 1956.
   ``The Republicans' problem in the House is that we don't take
them seriously, Republicans in the Senate don't take them seriously
and the White House doesn't take them seriously,'' Coelho added.
   ``I wonder what Tony's smoking?'' Cheney said when apprised of
the comments. ``The real problem is the speaker, and the way he
operates. ... He's trashed the CIA, damaged U.S. foreign policy in
Nicaragua. ... All of Tony Coelho's blue smoke and mirrors won't
change that.''

<TEXT>
   The Hollywood drivers union voted
overwhelmingly Thursday to strike television and film producers,
with the walkout set to begin Monday.
   Teamsters Local 399 voted 1,441-196 to reject the latest
contract presented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers, according to Teamster secretary-treasurer Earl Bush.
   ``Hopefully, with this kind of rejection, the alliance will take
another look'' at the offer, Bush said.
   He added, however, that he was not optimistic that the two sides
would settle their differences at a Friday bargaining session.
   Both sides have been asked by a federal mediator to resume
negotiations Friday. But the producers contend their terms are
final and that there is no room for more bargaining.
   Key issues include overtime rules, salary rates and guidelines
for the making of non-union films. Bush has called the producers'
offer ``the worst contract offer ever made to a union.''
   If the Teamsters walk out Monday, it will mark the second
entertainment industry strike this year. The Writers Guild of
America struck from March until August, and Hollywood production is
only now returning to full speed.
   Alliance spokesman Herb Steinberg said the strike by the
2,200-member Teamsters union local would not cripple the film and
television industry.
   ``We have trained drivers and we're ready to continue production
under any circumstances,'' Steinberg said. ``I don't think it will
have any impact on production. The studios are very well prepared.''
   He said newspaper advertisements for replacement drivers drew an
overwhelming response.

   Space shuttle Discovery carried the
American flag back into space Thursday after a 32-month absence,
its five astronauts riding a 700-foot tail of flame from rockets
meticulously redesigned after the Challenger disaster.
   ``Everyone certainly stood tall today,'' said Kennedy Space
Center director Forrest S. McCartney as Discovery settled into
orbit, 184 miles above earth. Mission Control said the ship was
``performing nominally.''
   It was the first launch since the Challenger explosion with its
toll of seven lives on a cold winter day shocked the nation and
stopped the manned space program in its tracks.
   ``We sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we
should be,'' Discovery's commander, Navy Capt. Frederick Hauck,
told Mission Control. ``We're looking forward to the next four days
_ we have a lot to do and we're going to have alot of fun doing
it.''
   Liftoff was the first and most important milestone, but more was
at stake than simply getting into space. The 2{-year grounding of
the shuttle fleet set back the nation's satellite delivery
capability, and release of a communications satellite was the main
order of business in orbit, six hours after launch.
   The giant Tracking and Data Relay Satellite is a $100-million
twin of the craft that was destroyed aboard Challenger.
   In Washington, President Reagan praised the launch, saying the
shuttle was ``headed into orbit and America is back in space.'' He
saluted the bravery of the crew and added, ``We ask God to bless
this important voyage.''
   Launch, at 11:37 a.m. EDT, came only after NASA waived weather
guidelines to allow for flight through some lighter-than-usual
Florida winds. The 98-minute delay simply heightened the tension as
NASA unveiled a spaceship that underwent more than 400
modifications since the Challenger flight.
   Just how well the Discovery's booster rockets performed in their
new design awaited detailed analysis. But J.R. Thompson, who
directed the work from the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama
said, ``From everything I see, everything looks great.''
   Hauck's veteran flight crew consisted of Air Force Col. Richard
Covey, Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers; John M. Lounge; and George
D. ``Pinky'' Nelson. Landing was scheduled for Monday at Edwards
Air Force Base in California.
   The astronauts had said all along they were treating the mission
as a test mission _ a ``shakedown flight,'' in the words of Covey _
and they quickly ran into first-flight problems. A water evaporator
that provides cooling to the ship during the climb to space and
return to Earth was partly clogged with ice. And a device that
provides electrial power to move an orbital steering engine was not
working.
   Neither problem was critical. Flight director Gary Coen said
engineers were devising ways of thawing the evaporator before it is
needed again and that backup power was available to turn the
steering engine.
   To the delight of a quarter-million people gathered on river
banks and highways and an ecstatic NASA team in Launch Control,
Discovery lifted off its seaside pad and streaked into cloudy
skies. It remained in view less than a half minute, but the tension
was considerable and the sight was unforgettable.
   Anxiety was highest as the ship went through a 30-second period
of severe aerodynamic stress. It was during this stage of the
flight that one of Challenger's booster rockets failed and
triggered the Jan. 28, 1986 catastrophe, 73 seconds after liftoff.
   Some television viewers reported what they thought was an errant
flame shooting from the left booster rocket about 90 seconds after
liftoff. Officials said an analysis revealed a harmless phenomena
that causes flame from the exhaust to ``climb'' up the side of the
rocket.
   ``It was not particularily unusual,'' said NASA's Steve Nesbitt.
   Cheers rang through Launch Control as the ship lifted, and
director Robert Sieck kidded his team later: ``I knew you couldn't
hold it. After a few long years you've got to let it out.'' Another
NASA official said the firing-room emotion ``dwarfs STS-1 (the
first shuttle flight) and all the others.''
   Discovery, an American flag on its left wing, was making its
seventh spaceflight.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Globe Of Libeling Former Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boston Globe did not libel then-Gov. Edward J.
King when it said in a 1981 column that he tried to influence a
judge's sentence in a gang rape case, a jury decided Thursday.
   After little more than two hours of deliberations, the Suffolk
Superior Court jury decided that the Globe was wrong when it
published a Nov. 8, 1981, column by David Farrell saying King had
called a judge and demanded harsher sentences in the case.
   But when asked if King had convinced them that the column
``discredited him in the minds of any considerable and respectable
class of the community,'' the jury answered no.
   Sixteen jurors began deliberating in the 6{-year-old case after
Judge James P. Lynch Jr. instructed the panel on libel law.
   The jurors were working on a special verdict slip that posed a
series of questions, beginning with whether the column was true.
King needed to prevail on each question or else lose his lawsuit.
   After the verdict, a composed King left the courtroom with his
wife, Jody, and his attorney, Robert Goldman, and declined to say
how the verdict might affect his political plans. King had said he
would consider running for governor again if he won.
   ``We did the best we could,'' King said, adding he did not
consider the lawsuit a waste of time because ``now we know that
something the Globe never retracted was a false statement.''
   King, who joined the Republican Party after losing the September
1982 Democratic primary to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, filed suit in
January 1982 against the Globe and several editorial employees,
asking for $3.6 million.
   King said he and his lawyer would decide on an appeal within 30
days.
   ``It's terrific to have been vindicated. This is a victory for
freedom of the press,'' said Boston Globe attorney Joseph Kociubes.
   ``I always felt I did a good job writing the column,'' said
Farrell, who now works as a free-lance public relations agent.
   The jury heard closing arguments Wednesday after six days of
testimony.
   King testified the column amounted to a charge of obstruction of
justice that struck him like ``an ice pick in the ribs'' and caused
him to lose sleep on more than 1,000 nights since publication.
   On cross-examination, King acknowledged that he never publicly
denied making the call, and Kociubes argued that King, who was
thinking of suing the Globe before the column, made no showing of
financial, social or political harm.
   Farrell testified he was told about King's purported call to
Judge Herbert Abrams by state Treasurer Robert Q. Crane, an old
friend and a reliable source about Massachusetts politics.
   Crane testified he was the source, but could not recall who told
him about the call.
   Under libel law, a public figure, such as King, has the burden
of showing not only that a publication was false but also that it
defamed him. Further, the governor must show that the column was
published with ``actual malice'' _ that is, with knowing falsity or
with ``reckless disregard'' for the truth.
   Lynch instructed the jury that ``reckless disregard'' means that
Farrell and the Globe ``entertained serious doubts about the truth
of the statement.''
   The judge said such doubt could concern the source, but he said
that mere failure to investigate Crane's tip by itself did not
constitute libel.

   Some television viewers were alarmed
Thursday to see what looked like flame spewing from the side of a
booster rocket after Discovery blasted off, but experts attributed
it to a phenomenon of physics and said the shuttle was never in
danger.
   At Goddard Flight Space Center in Maryland there were reportedly
gasps and moans at what seemed to be flames licking up the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters less than a minute before
separation from the ship. It looked to some like a ghastly replay
of the Challenger disaster in which a flame from a joint in a
booster rocket blew up the shuttle 73 seconds into flight.
   As reporters and people at home, including former space
employees, watched televised reruns, calls began pouring into
newsrooms while space officials studied tapes to be sure there was
no problem.
   A former NASA employee who didn't want to be identified called
the Beloit, Kan., Daily Call and said NASA apparently was lucky,
said Publisher Gary Hilt.
   ``In terms of flames that somebody might report, I don't have
any information,'' said Steve Nesbitt, the voice of Kennedy Space
Center mission control, where officials who reacted jubilantly to
the launch quickly asked booster experts to analyze tapes of the
launch as the concerned queries began.
   But officials of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama,
who are responsible for the operation of the boosters, said the
flash was no cause for alarm.
   ``It's predictable, repeatable,'' said Royce Mitchell, Solid
Rocket manager from Marshall who was at Kennedy Space Center for
the launch.
   He recalled a similar ``flickering'' after the Discovery's first
liftoff in 1984.
   ``It's just a basic law of physics,'' Mitchell said, terming it
``reverse flow separation.''
   Mitchell said that as shuttle begins to roll, the booster plumes
_ the flame that comes from the bottom of the rockets in normal
operation _ sometimes converge and the hot particles recirculate.
   He compared the visual effect to seeing a man on a speeding
motorcycle. Instead of his jacket flapping out behind, it is
plastered to his back because of the reverse separation principle.
   Marshall center director J.R. Thompson celebrated with a
Jamaican cigar and officials said they were confident about the
boosters' performance.
   ``Everything looks normal ... everything looks good,'' Mitchell
said.
   Divers had reached the reusable boosters and their first ``quick
look'' indicated no problems, he said.
   Mitchell said as soon as the recovery ships towed the boosters
to port Friday night, ``We'll look at them almost immediately.
   ``Everybody wants to look at this first joint, and you're
looking at the guy who wants to look at it first.''

<TEXT>
   The family of three AIDS-exposed hemophiliac
brothers who were once barred from school settled a civil rights
suit against the school district for more than $1.1 million
Thursday.
   Under a settlement between Louise and Clifford Ray and the
DeSoto County School District, the couple's three sons each will
get $820 a month for the next 10 years, for a total of nearly
$100,000 apiece.
   The parents will each get $50,000 now and about $300 monthly for
30 years. The total to each parent, including a built-in 3 percent
inflation rate, amounts to more than $220,000.
   Judy Kavanaugh, the Rays' attorney, said that as far as she knew
it was the first time that damages were won by an AIDS victim for
violation of civil rights.
   The settlement, to be paid by the school district's insurance
company, includes an additional $387,500 for attorney fees, plus
$50,000 for court costs.
   The brothers _ Ricky, 11, Robert, 10, and Randy, 8 _ probably
were exposed to the viris that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome through plasma-based medication to clot their blood. All
three have hemophilia, an inherited disease that keeps blood from
clotting.
   None of the boys has developed AIDS, but the oldest, Ricky, has
developed AIDS-related complex, which can be a precursor to the
deadly disease. He is being treated with the anti-AIDS drug AZT.
   The two sides outlined details of the agreement in an appearance
before U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich. She praised both
sides for settling the dispute without a trial.
   The trial had been set to begin Monday in Fort Myers.
   The settlement marks the end of the Rays' complaint that school
officials violated their sons' civil rights by refusing to allow
them to attend Memorial Elementary School in Arcadia in 1986 and
1987 for fear of spreading the deadly disease. Experts say the
disease cannot be spread by casual contact.
   The boys finally were admitted under federal court order in
August 1987 over objections of angry parents, who staged a
week-long boycott that cut school attendance in half.
   At the end of that week, the Rays' home was burned by an unknown
arsonist. The family then moved to Sarasota, where the boys now
attend school.
   The settlement did not require school officials to admit any
negligence in the way the boys or their family were treated,
according to James Westberry, school board chairman.
   The lawsuit had accused school officials of abusing their power,
depriving the boys of their rights because they were handicapped,
and helping create an atmosphere of hatred against the boys in
Arcadia.
   ``It was better this way, thinking about the length of time
involved,'' said Mrs. Ray after the settlement was approved.
   She said she hopes the school board members ``have learned as
much from this situation as we have. You shouldn't be afraid of
someone who has AIDS because you can't catch it. And if you have a
disease, you shouldn't have to be ashamed of it.''
   Patrick E. Geraghty, attorney for the insurer, National Union
Fire Insurance Co., said he would have preferred to go to trial but
agreed to settle ``in an effort to have the matter resolved and put
behind everyone.''
   At the time the boys were excluded, school officials contended
that not enough was known about AIDS for them to be completely
certain there was no risk to other pupils.

<HEAD>Medicare One-Time Hospital Deductible Will Rise to $560 in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The one-time deductible that Medicare
beneficaries will have to pay out of their own pockets if
hospitalized next year will be $560, the Department of Health and
Human Services announced Thursday.
   That is an increase of $20 from this year and goes along with a
$3.10-per-month rise in the optional Part B premium that helps pay
doctor bills.
   Because of new provisions in the catastrophic health insurance
law that will take effect Jan. 1, there will be only a one-time
hospital deductible for Medicare beneficiaries next year no matter
how many times they might be hospitalized.
   Under existing law, the deductible _ $540 in 1988 _ could be
charged for each hospitalization.
   The $560 deductible for 1989, made official with publication in
the Federal Register, is the same amount that had been projected in
debate leading up to passage of the catastrophic coverage act.
   By law, the deductible is pegged to increases in hospital costs,
and HHS officials had a pretty good idea of how much those costs
were rising even before the final, formal tabulations were done.
Technically, the deductible would go down if average hospital costs
ever fell.
   The regular Part B premium charged beneficiaries to help cover
the cost of doctor bills paid by Medicare will increase from the
present $24.80 a month to $27.90. That, too, is in line with
earlier projections. HHS officials told Congress several months ago
they estimated the 1989 Part B premium would be about $28 a month.
   In addition to the regular Part B increase that is pegged to
program costs already incurred, a flat premium of $4 per month to
help pay for new benefits under the catastrophic coverage will
begin in January, making the premium $31.90 per month per person.
   The $4 linked to the increased catastrophic benefits is
mandatory, while the $27.90 is voluntary.
   As a practical matter, however, almost all of the 31 million
Medicare enrollees _ about 98 percent _ voluntary take the Part B
doctor bill coverage because it buys protection they could not
purchase on the private insurance market at anywhere near the same
price.
   Current law requires that Part B premiums paid by beneficaries
must equal 25 percent of the total costs of the physician
remimbursement program. The rest is paid by tax revenue.
   Like the hospital deductible, the Part B premium is adjusted
each year according to a formula pegged to actual costs the
preceeding year.
   Part B outlays _ a direct reflection of the amount the nation's
doctors charge the federal government for Medicare patients _ are
the fastest rising segment of the federal budget.

   NASA workers unfurled a flag in the
firing room at Kennedy Space Center in the final hours before
Discovery's launch Thursday and said it would remain in place until
the shuttle returns.
   The flag ceremony will be a tradition in the launch control
center from now on, NASA spokesman Hugh Harris said.
   ``It was not a very formal sort of thing,'' he said. ``You don't
take time out of the countdown. It was just as the announcement was
made that the rotating service structure was being retracted that
the string was pulled and the flag rolled down.''
   The rotating service structure was rolled away from Discovery
Wednesday afternoon.
   Discovery's five-man crew plan a special memorial in space for
Challenger's seven astronauts, according to Commander Frederick H.
Hauck. The nature of the memorial will be revealed during a news
conference the astronauts plan to hold on the mission's third day,
he said during a prelaunch interview.
   ``If we ever forget what happened to Challenger, it's going to
be a sad day, because we might become complacent once again,'' said
Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, one of Discovery's crew members.

   The Senate gave a near unanimous stamp of
approval Thursday to the first major welfare overhaul in over half
a century, seeking to turn the system into a gate of opportunity
rather than a long-term trap.
   ``For the first time in its half-century existence, the U.S.
Senate has moved to an entire redefinition and overhaul of what
we've come to know as our welfare system,'' said Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the leader of the effort.
   The vote on the final version of the Family Welfare Reform Act
was 96-1, with Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the lone opponent. The
bill was headed for House approval Friday and from there to the
White House, where President Reagan has expressed satisfaction with
it.
   The hard-won bipartisan compromise, the result of a summer of
seesaw negotiations, centers on a large-scale work, education and
training program to be aimed primarily at welfare mothers. Support
services such as child care would be available to program
participants and those moving into low-wage jobs.
   ``In early 1987, we had a process that many of us never really
thought would be complete,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan. ``Lo and behold, here we are today with a bill we can
support.''
   Moynihan said that under the revamped system, welfare will ``no
longer be a permanent or extended condition.'' Instead, he said,
the new system will stress work, child support and last-resort cash
supplements while encouraging the needy to get the education and
training needed to avert long-term dependence.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., a key supporter of the drive, said
there's no guarantee the bill will work. ``But if it does only half
of what we hope, it's an immense step forward,'' he said. ``What we
have had does not work. That we can say with certainty.''
   The five-year, $3.3 billion compromise plan is modeled largely
on Moynihan's Senate bill, which passed 93-3 in June. Its Job
Opportunities and Basic Skills program starts out at $600 million
in 1989, rising to $1.3 billion by 1995, when states would have to
be serving 20 percent of eligible recipients.
   The bill also requires that starting in 1991, all states provide
benefits to two-parent unemployed households; only 27 now do so.
The other 23 could limit benefits to six months in a 12-month
period.
   The final compromise contains some provisions that House
liberals found hard to swallow, among them a 16-hour-a-week
workfare requirement for one adult in two-parent families receiving
welfare. The requirement, effective in 1994, would kick in for that
relatively small group only if an intensive two-month job search
failed.
   Conservatives called it the first step toward a wider work
requirement while liberals complained bitterly about slavery and
punishment. Some discontented House members were expected to vote
against the bill, but they are a minority.
   The least controversial aspect of the welfare overhaul is its
opening section, designed to step up child support payments from
non-custodial parents. The section requires automatic
wage-withholding when a court awards support and a higher rate of
paternity establishment by states.
   ``It makes a statement about what our society believes the role
of parents should be,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., an
original sponsor of the Moynihan bill. ``Parents should provide for
their children.''
   The current welfare system, Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, serves 3.7 million families, including 7 million
children. AFDC costs the federal government about $8.5 billion a
year in cash benefits.

   Prices farmers got for raw products in
September rose 0.7 percent from August, including the highest wheat
prices in almost seven years, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   But the rise from August to September was the smallest monthly
increase since the drought began cutting 1988 harvest prospects and
triggered rising prices last spring.
   After holding steady during most of the winter, the USDA index
rose 3.1 percent from April to May, followed by 2.2 percent in
June, 2.9 percent in July and 2.1 percent in August.
   Mostly as a result of the drought and searing heat during the
spring and summer, U.S. grain production is expected to be down 31
percent from last year's harvest.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for grapefruit, milk and
wheat contributed most to the September increase. Lower prices for
hogs, oranges and broiler chickens partly offset the rise in other
commodities.
   The September prices averaged 12 percent higher than a year
earlier. Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month
averages and then are revised the following month when additional
information is available.
   ``The mid-September prices for corn, soybeans and wheat were
higher than the respective averages for the month of August,'' the
report said. ``The all-wheat price was at the highest level since
November of 1981.''
   But the report added that ``hog prices dropped off sharply''
from August and continued well below the high prices sustained
during the last half of 1986 and in most of 1987.
   Prices of meat animals as a group dropped l.8 percent from
August and averaged 3.5 percent below the level of September 1987.
   Dairy products climbed 3.3 percent from the August price
average, overall, but still lagged a year earlier by 3.8 percent,
the report said. Milk prices paid to farmers were up 40 cents per
100 pounds from August but were 50 cents below the year-ago level.
   The department's all-crops price index for September was up 3
percent from August and averaged 32 percent more than a year ago.
Soybeans, at $8.42 per bushel, were up 9 cents from August, and
wheat averaged $3.82 per bushel, up 21 cents.
   Prices of fruit, as an overall average, were up 3.9 percent from
August and 2.2 percent from a year ago, the report said. Commercial
vegetables were up 4.1 percent from August, averaging 20 percent
more than in September 1987.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $55
billion to $60 billion this year, compared with the record level of
$57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts
and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent
this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987.
Before the drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent.
   Department officials have predicted that the drought may add two
percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected
increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to
7 percent.
   The report did not include new figures showing what farmers pay
to meet expenses. Those are reported quarterly, and the most recent
figures released in July showed farm production costs were up 2.4
percent from April, averaging 4.9 percent more than in July 1987.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $66 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $65.90 in August and $63.70 reported for September 1987.
Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $40.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $44.70 in
August and $54.30 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.71 a bushel, was up from $2.65 in August and the
average of $1.49 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.82 per bushel, compared with $3.61 in August and $2.54
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.42 in
August and $4.32 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $8.42 per bushel, compared with $8.33 in August
and $5.02 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 52 cents per pound, compared with
52.6 in August and 64.9 cents in September 1987.
   _Eggs were 63.8 cents per dozen, compared with 58.1 cents in
August and 58.2 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.80 in August
and $12.70 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 39.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
41.9 cents in August and 31.3 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Sarah Brady Says Legislators Lack `Guts'</HEAD>

   Sarah Brady, whose husband was shot along with
President Reagan in 1981, said Thursday the majority of House
members defeated a handgun waiting period because they ``didn't
have the guts'' to stand up to the National Rifle Association.
   She said the House ``caved in'' to the NRA's lobbying against
the legislation in an election year, and added that some lawmakers
``turned tail'' after promising Handgun Control Inc. they would
back the waiting period.
   Mrs. Brady is vice chair of the gun control organization, which
lobbied along with law enforcement organizations for a seven-day
waiting period with an optional police background check.
   Mrs. Brady contended that the NRA leadership, which once
supported waiting periods, has become more extreme and no longer
represents its membership.
   NRA president Joe Foss, who was in the audience for Mrs. Brady's
talk, said afterwards, ``I'm no extremist.'' He said the
organization's leadership does represent its members, adding, ``I
am out there with them. I have a pretty good pulse.
   ``Whenever you lose, people always say it wasn't a fair fight.''
   Foss, a former World War II flying ace and a onetime South
Dakota governor, was elected to a two-year term as NRA president in
April.
   Mrs. Brady, the wife of presidential press secretary James
Brady, spoke at the National Press Club. Her husband was seriously
wounded when shot in the head by John W. Hinckley Jr. in his March
30, 1981, assassination attempt on the president.
   The House voted 228-182 on Sept. 16 to delete the proposed
seven-day waiting period from an anti-drug bill, despite the
well-coordinated police-gun control group lobbying effort.
   The vote, which followed a strong NRA campaign against the
language, substituted a plan designed to allow gun dealers to
quickly identify convicted felons seeking to buy pistols. The House
bill ordered the Justice Department to devise an identification
system in six months and present it to Congress.
   The Brady forces argued that criminals could easily buy guns in
the 28 states without a waiting period, while the NRA said a
waiting period would only hurt law-abiding citizens.
   While the House passed the overall drug bill, the Senate has yet
to consider its own anti-drug legislation.
   Although both sides concede the chance for a waiting period is
dead for the year, senators could decide to approve an
identification system.
   Mrs. Brady said in her speech, ``I'm disappointed at the caliber
of members of Congress who didn't have the guts to speak up to one
of the most powerful lobbies in Washington. I have experienced the
power of the NRA.''
   Predicting that lawmakers would have less ``fear'' of supporting
gun control in a non-election year, Mrs. Brady vowed to try again
for the waiting period in 1989.
   ``Until Congress comes to terms with its own conscience, more
blood is going to be spilled,'' she said, referring to killings
with handguns.
   ``The law enforcement community is mad. They're ready to do some
heavy lobbying. After the vote on the Brady bill they were irate.''
   Purchasing guns, she said, ``shouldn't be as easy as buying
bubble gum.''

   A second little girl died Thursday of
wounds received in a gunman's rampage at an elementary school, and
her classmates returned to school to find police guarding the
grounds and teachers ready to help them through the tragedy.
   Tequila Thomas, 8, a third-grader at Oakland Elementary School,
died about 12:30 p.m., never having regained consciousness since
she arrived at Self Memorial Hospital after the shooting three days
earlier, said hospital spokesman Dan Branyon.
   Oakland Principal Eleanor Rice said the parents of the school's
600 students seem to have had most of their fears calmed since
James William Wilson opened fire Monday, reportedly focusing on
children who cried.
   In a newspaper interview published Thursday, Wilson said he was
sorry about what happened and said he was patterning his actions in
part on a Chicago-area woman's rampage in May.
   Pupils, many accompanied by their parents, returned to school
Thursday to find the grounds edged with police officers. At least
one child still wore a sling on her arm from the wound she received
Monday.
   Mrs. Rice said staff members met with counselors Wednesday to
learn how to help their pupils deal with the shootings.
   ``We've not had any calls suggesting students didn't want to
come,'' the principal said. ``Some of our students have some fears,
and we're going to work through that.
   ``Certainly, anything of this magnitude, it's going to take some
time to recover.''
   Leah Holmes, 8, her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound, shook
her head emphatically and said ``Nope,'' when asked Thursday
morning if she was scared to go back to school. But other children
and parents arriving at the school were less sure.
   ``We're a little nervous, but it's just been a shock
primarily,'' said Alan Maxwell, as he walked his daughter Katy to
school. Katy said she didn't hear the gunshots but remembers a
teacher coming into her classroom and telling everyone to duck
under their desks.
   Teachers took the children on tours of the building Thursday,
including the cafeteria where much of the shooting took place, to
satisfy the children's curiosity, schools Superintendent Robert
Watson said at a news conference.
   ``There were a variety of different activities in the classroom
where they allowed the children to act out some of their
feelings,'' Watson said.
   ``Several teachers felt they saw a lot of anger ... a lot of
getting feelings out about the killer,'' he said.
   ``Our absentee rate today was a little bit above normal,'' he
said. Forty-three children were out, including those who were sick,
he said.
   Wilson, 19, of Greenwood is being held on two murder charges and
undergoing psychological testing at the State Hospital in Columbia.
Police and witnesses said he walked calmly through the school
Monday morning, shooting two teachers and nine pupils before
surrendering.
   Relatives have described him as a hyperactive recluse who has
been in and out of a psychiatric ward during the past eight months.
   Self Memorial Hospital spokesman Branyon said Tequila had been
wounded in the neck and chest, and her condition had continued to
deteriorate. She died Thursday with her family at her side. The
other victim, Shequila Bradley, 8, died at the school Monday.
   Two teachers remained hospitalized in good condition Thursday
and one of the students treated and released Monday was readmitted
to the hospital, listed in fair condition. Lashonda Burt, 8, was
hospitalized again because she was complaining of discomfort from
her wounds, Branyon said.
   The State newspaper reported Thursday that Wilson said that
during the shooting he was thinking about other crimes he had read
about, and the teasing he received while in school for being
overweight and dressing funny.
   ``I thought some of the students in the school were after me. I
was trying to make them be quiet. I feel real bad about what
happened,'' Wilson told the newspaper.
   He said he had stayed up all night before the shootings, reading
a book about John Wayne Gacy, who is on Illinois' death row for
killing 33 men and boys. Wilson said ``it's possible'' the book was
a factor in the shootings.
   The newspaper said he also mentioned a magazine article about
Laurie Dann, the 30-year-old baby sitter who shot six children in a
Chicago-area elementary school in May before killing herself. An
8-year-old boy died.
   ``I could understand where she was coming from. I think I may
have copied her in a way,'' Wilson told the newspaper.

   After 32 months and long, agonizing
minutes Thursday, the sight of the shuttle Discovery reaching for
space didn't bring a cheer from flight controllers at Mission
Control.
   They stared at their screens intently and held back. No applause
when Discovery passed 73 seconds into flight. None until they were
sure it was going to be OK.
   Two minutes and 4 seconds into flight, when Discovery separated
from the solid rocket boosters, those at the controls here broke
into applause.
   It was the boosters that caused the Challenger explosion 73
seconds into flight.
   Throughout the countdown and launch, Mission Control was calm,
yet tense. Red and white carnations adorned the desk of the flight
director, Gary Coen, a good-luck gift from the security division of
the Johnson Space Center.
   At 10:10 a.m. CDT, Coen polled the room to see if conditions
were set to go. The decision to go brought a thumbs-up sign of
encouragement from two NASA veterans, Tommy Holloway, manager of
mission operations, and Eugene Kranz, director of mission
operations and the team director during the Apollo 13 crisis.
   ``I felt like that as the spacecraft was going into orbit, the
mood was staying down to business. I don't think there were too
many people that were reflecting or being moody for that first 8
minutes and 40 seconds,'' Coen said later during a press briefing
Thursday afternoon.
   ``I'm sure that there were a lot of people, me included, that
were very happy post-MECO _ after the engines shut down _ that we
were back in the space business,'' Coen added.
   Visitors in a viewing room were seen biting nails and clenching
fists as liftoff neared.
   Jay Green, chief of NASA's safety program and flight director
for Challenger, stood in the back of the room, hands on a
bannister, staring down.
   The room was quiet when Discovery lifted off, except for cheers
from the spectators. After the controllers' applause for the solid
rocket booster separation, Mission Control fell quiet again until
the main engines cut off. Then more cheers.
   ``We're going into space,'' said public information officer Jeff
Carr.

<HEAD>Pryor Says Reagan's IRS Fail To Chase Tax Scofflaws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate panel that oversees
the Internal Revenue Service accused the Reagan administration's
IRS on Thursday of failing to pursue big-time operators who deal in
cash and don't file tax returns.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., cited a June 1986 IRS internal audit
which concluded that the agency needs to do a better job of
enforcing a law requiring the reporting of cash transactions over
$10,000. The audit found that in many cases, banks file the cash
reports as required, only to have the IRS ignore them.
   ``This is an outrage,'' Pryor said in a Senate speech. ``These
people are walking into our financial institutions with
wheelbarrows and suitcases full of cash money, and the banks are
telling the IRS who and where they are. ... The IRS has their
addresses, and yet no one from this administration so much as
knocked on their door.''
   Pryor was responding to speech Wednesday in which Vice President
George Bush accused Democratic rival Michael Dukakis of advocating
the unleashing of an army of new IRS agents to collect enough money
to balance the budget.
   Dukakis is calling for more IRS personnel to reduce the
estimated $85 billion annual gap between taxes owed and paid.
   Instead of criticizing Dukakis' proposals, Pryor said, Bush
should be explaining why the administration has failed to pursue
the big spenders identified by the reports.
   Pryor, who chairs the Finance subcommittee on the IRS, released
portions of an IRS analysis of a sampling of cash-transaction
reports filed with the agency. ``Current systems do not assure that
taxpayers with significant currency transactions are considered for
examination (audit) or that currency activity is evaluated during
examinations,'' the IRS document read.
   Of 924 individuals identified as having made large cash
transactions, only 680 filed tax returns, the IRS concluded.
   ``Only 211 of the 680 tax returns were examined or classified.
The average currency activity by the 211 taxpayers was $228,000. We
reviewed 67 of the 211 cases. In 61 instances, CTR (currency
transaction report) information was not considered in determining
the correct tax liability,'' the IRS found.
   Of the 244 cases in which tax returns wer not filed,
investigations of a tax delinquency were begun in only 47.
   ``No action was taken for the remaining 197 individuals,'' the
report stated. ``These 197 individuals had currency activity for
1982 averaging $183,000 each.''
   ``We spend millions of dollars each year to collect this
information, yet this administration has failed to use it,'' Pryor
said.
   ``The report is two years old, based on data from 1982,'' IRS
spokesman Wilson Fadely said. ``The IRS has taken a number of
actions since then.''
   For example, Fadely said, data on cash-transaction reports are
now provided to district offices for use by collection personnel.
Auditors soon will be implementing a system that gives auditors in
district offices computer access to information on cash reports
while an examination is under way.

<TEXT>
   A father and son accused of trying to smuggle
spare missile parts to their native Iran blamed each other in
opening arguments in their federal trial here Thursday.
   U.S. Customs agents arrested Ahmad and Majid Modarressi in
January at a suburban Boston railyard where they allegedly had come
to buy $280,000 worth of electronic tubes for Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles.
   An attorney for the father, Ahmad Modarressi, 64, of Tehran,
Iran, and Istanbul, Turkey, told the jury that Majid, 30, arranged
the deal and never told his father it was illegal.
   But an attorney for the son, who lives in Cincinnati with his
American wife, maintained that he acted only as a translator for
his father and was ``a very naive person'' who did not understand
what the elder Modarressi was trying to buy and ship to Iran.
   Defense attorneys said after the court session that they hoped
the jury would clear both men.
   ``I guess the best possible outcome would be if they found Majid
was just an airhead and (the elder) Modarressi didn't know it was
illegal,'' said Hugh Scott, attorney for the father.
   The defense attorneys had asked for separate trials but the
motion was denied by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf.
   The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Sterns, said the
Modarressis were arrested after a four-month investigation in which
a customs agent had posed as an official of the Raytheon Corp. of
Lexington, maker of the Hawk missile parts.
   The agent, Steve Crogan, recorded more than a dozen
conversations with the Modarressis in which they talked about
buying up to $60 million of U.S. weapons but eventually settled on
the four electronic tubes worth $280,000 Sterns said.
   The Modarressis entered the courtroom together, left together
and sat together during the opening arguments. If convicted of
conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act, each could face
up to 15 years in prison, a $1.25 million fine and deportation.
   Sterns said the electronic Klystron and Twystron tubes, each of
which is about 4 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, are used in a
mobile radar that is integral to the Hawk system, a missile the
Iranians could use to shoot down aircraft.
   Owen Walker, the federal public defender representing Majid
Modarressi, said ``these kind of tubes are used in practically ...
every radar system, every TV station, every radio station. There's
nothing uniquely or inherently military about them.''
   Walker said the younger Modarressi came to the United States in
1976 to study architectural drafting, married his wife, Alicia, in
1982 and settled in Ohio, where he works as an architectural
consultant.
   The elder Modarressi was described by defense attorneys as an
international merchant who has dealt in shoes and pistachios and
had briefly discussed becoming Raytheon's Middle East sales
representative in 1984.

test that counted Thursday when they powered Discovery successfully
toward orbit.
   ``From everything I see, everything looks great,'' said J.R.
Thompson, who directed the booster overhaul project from the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. He awaited, along with
other NASA officials, data that would provide a detailed analysis
of the booster performance.
   Some people watching the launch on television were alarmed to
see what looked like flame spewing from the side of one rocket
after liftoff, as if in awful imitation of the Challenger disaster.
But experts attributed it to a trick of physics that had been
observed during other normal launches.
   The 149-foot-long reusable rockets peeled off from the shuttle
right on schedule after their fuel was burned out at 2 minutes, 4
seconds into flight.
   The spent casings dropped into the Atlantic Ocean, their fall
slowed by parachutes, and were quickly recovered by the ships
Liberty Star and Freedom Star 150 miles off the Florida coast.
   Stuart Shadbolt, a spokesman for Lockheed Space Operations Co.,
which is in charge of the recovery, said the boosters were expected
to reach Port Canaveral, Fla., under tow by Friday night.
   NASA said crews who inspected the boosters in the water reported
they appeared to be in good shape. Kennedy Space Center spokesman
Dick Young said early data showed ``no anomalies.''
   The rockets will get a far more intense scrutiny once they are
towed to shore and before they are refitted by manufacturer Morton
Thiokol Inc. for use on a future flight.
   It was a failure of the booster rockets that caused the
explosion of Challenger and the death of its seven crew members 73
seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The Rogers Commission, which investigated the destruction of
Challenger, blamed that disaster on an O-ring that failed to seal
in cold-weather conditions, allowing flame to escape and ignite a
fuel tank.
   Rather than delay resumption of shuttle flights until it could
develop an entirely new booster, NASA spent $800 million to make
145 changes in the design and then conducted a series of demanding
tests.
   Experts said the results of all the changes are rockets just
short of the best design possible.
   ``If you started with a clean sheet of paper, there are things
you could do'' to improve the rockets, said Russ Bardos, NASA's
director of shuttle propulsion.
   When fully loaded with 1.1 million pounds of propellant, each
booster weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces 3.3 million pounds
of thrust. Two are used for each shuttle launch, providing 80
percent of the power needed to lift the winged spacecraft from the
pad toward orbit.
   Because the rockets are so massive, they are manufactured in
four segments. Each segment is joined at a seam called a field
joint. The parts are assembled at the Kennedy Space Center.
   The joints used for 25 shuttle flights had a metal rim, called a
tang, that fit into a deep metal groove called a clevis. On one
side of the clevis were two O-ring seals made of a rubberized
material. The clevis and tang were held together by bolts.
   Experience showed that when the rocket booster fired, generating
about 900 pounds of internal pressure, the thick steel booster
casing ballooned slightly, an action called ``rotation.'' This
caused the clevis and tang to separate slightly, preventing the
O-rings from sealing.
   The O-rings also are less likely to seal if the rubberized
material is made hard by cold temperatures. Challenger was launched
after soaking in freezing temperatures overnight.
   The rotation problem was corrected by a new joint that added a
metal lip, called a capture feature, to the tang. This joint
resembles a handshake, with the new ``thumb'' on the tang giving
extra strength.
   The redesign team also added a third O-ring and installed
heaters to keep the joint a constant 75 degrees. Inside the rocket,
insulation was redesigned to include a J-shaped slit. Under
pressure, the slit causes insulation to shift, forming still
another seal.
   Engineers also realized that a nozzle-to-case joint on the
booster was even more flawed than the case joint. To correct this
problem, the redesign team added 100 bolts for added strength, an
additional O-ring seal, and put a slit-seal in the insulation.
   As to the appearance of flame from the side of the rocket during
Thursday's launch, Royce Mitchell, Solid Rocket manager at
Marshall, said it was due to the physical law of ``reverse flow
separation.''
   Mitchell said that as the shuttle begins to roll, the booster
plumes _ the flame that comes from the bottom of the rockets in
normal operation _ sometimes converge and the hot particles
recirculate.
   He compared the visual effect to seeing a man on a speeding
motorcycle. Instead of his jacket flapping out behind, it is
plastered to his back because of the reverse separation principle.

   State Republican Party officials and the
state director of George Bush's presidential campaign are
disavowing any connection with an advertisement against Michael
Dukakis sponsored by a group called Greeks Against Dukakis.
   Republican George Shissias of Columbia said he wanted to welcome
Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen to town
Wednesday, so he took out the full-page advertisement in The
(Columbia) State headlined ``Hazards of Duke.''
   Bentsen canceled his trip, but the ad ran Wednesday anyway.
   The content of the newspaper ad is based on a Republican
National Committee publication called ``The Hazards of Duke,'' a
312-page volume of issues and quotes to use against Dukakis.
   Shissias said Wednesday he collected money to pay for the ad and
hired a professional agency in Columbia to produce it. The ad,
which appeared only in The State, said: ``Paid for by Greeks
Against Dukakis; Steve Moskos, chairman (Charleston); John
Raftakis, vice chairman (Anderson); George Shissias, treasurer
(Columbia).''
   Shissias said there is no formally organized Greeks Against
Dukakis, and there has been no meeting and no election of officers.
He said the men just agreed to use their names on the ad and to
help pay for it.
   Ginny Wolfe, state director for the George Bush campaign, said
the Bush camp had nothing to do with the ad.
   Tony Denny, executive director of the state Republican Party,
said the party was not involved and that the three men who signed
the ad are not state or local party officers.
   Lt. Gov. Nick Theodore, a co-chairman of Dukakis' state
campaign, said that if there had been many more Greek-Americans
against Dukakis, their names would have appeared on it. Theodore is
of Greek descent.

   A Miami-bound Eastern Airlines jet
with 130 people aboard slid off the runway while taxiing for
takeoff Thursday, breaking the landing gear, starting an engine
fire and injuring nine people, officials said.
   The Boeing 727 was quickly evacuated and firefighters soon
extinguished the blaze in the left engine, said a control tower
official.
   The plane, carrying 122 passengers and eight crew members,
apparently had problems with its landing gear shortly before the
accident, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
None of the Americans aboard was injured.
   ``The plane had started taxiing, then we realized it was bumping
along the runway. It left the tarmac, dropped its nose and ended up
crosswise on the runway,'' the tower official said.
   The jet came to a stop after the front landing gear snapped and
the nose plowed into the ground just off the runway, he said. The
engine fire apparently began when the engine scraped the runway
after the landing gear broke.
   Civil aviation and Eastern officials refused to comment.
   The control tower official said most of the passengers were
Costa Rican.
   An official at the Hospital Mexico said all nine injured were
Costa Rican and they were treated and released. The official
refused to be identified.
   All flights in and out of Juan Santamaria International Airport
were suspended after the 8:40 a.m. (10:40 a.m. EDT) accident. A Pan
American flight had to return to Panama because it could not land.

<HEAD>Pentagon Weapons Tester Says Aegis System Adequately Tested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Aegis electronic system was adequately
tested before the Navy began buying the sophisticated ship defense,
the Pentagon chief weapons tester told Congress on Thursday.
   The report by John E. Krings disputed a study by the General
Accounting Office, which had raised questions about the adequacy of
tests of the Aegis system.
   ``The operational testing of Aegis has been adequate to support
the acquisition decisions that have been made and more testing will
be conducted to support future decisions,'' Krings, director of the
Pentagon's new operational test and evaluation program, told a
House subcommittee.
   It was an Aegis-class cruiser, the Vincennes, which shot down an
Iranian commercial airliner in the Persian Gulf on July 3 in the
mistaken belief that the plane was an Iranian military jet. All 290
persons aboard the jetliner were killed.
   Questions were raised in the wake of the incident about Aegis,
which the Navy has touted as the world's most sophisticated air
defense system.
   But a Navy investigation into the shootdown exonerated the Aegis
system, concluding that it worked as designed. The probe concluded
that human error led to the mistakes and said Navy officers on the
Vincennes misread data.
   Krings' office was created by Congress five years ago in the
wake of reports that weapons had performed poorly because they
hadn't been realistically tested before they were purchased by the
Pentagon.
   The Navy is relying heavily on the Aegis system to protect its
surface fleet, putting it aboard a new class of destroyers along
with the Aegis-class cruisers.
   The GAO criticized the Aegis tests, but that criticism was
contained as part of a larger GAO study which pointed out what the
congressional watchdog agency said were shortcomings in the
operation of Krings' office.
   The GAO said atmospheric ducting occurred in April 1984 during
Aegis testing. Ducting could have unfairly biased the reports of
some of the tests, according to GAO.
   Krings disputed the GAO's complaints about the testing of the
Aegis system.
   ``Ducting is a natural phenomenom prevalent in many areas of the
world, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf,'' he
told the Armed Services seapower subcommittee.
   ``The operational tester has no control over whether or not
ducting will be present during a test,'' he said. ``To run
operational tests with a stipulation that they not be run when
ducting occurs would be as unrealistic as a stipulation that tests
only be run when ducting is present.''

<TEXT>
   Whitney North Seymour Jr., the independent
counsel who obtained former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver's
perjury conviction, is offering himself as a paid campus speaker on
government ethics.
   A letter that Seymour circulated to colleges and universities in
July _ before Deaver's sentencing this month _ was released by a
former Justice Department official who argued the independent
counsel was being hypocritical about government ethics.
   ``If he's so concerned about ethics, let him take his expenses
and speak for free,'' said Gary L. McDowell, a research fellow at
the National Legal Center for the Public Interest.
   McDowell, who had written speeches for then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, said he received the letter from a friend, whom he
would identify only as a college professor who had received the
solicitation before Deaver's sentencing.
   In the letter, Seymour wrote that ``following last December's
guilty verdict in the Michael Deaver case, I was asked to speak to
college and law school audiences about Washington ethics.''
   ``I hope to schedule more campus visits this coming year, and I
am writing to enlist your help.''
   ``As a result of my indoctrination in the ways of Washington as
independent counsel in the Deaver case, I have developed quite
strong views on how to achieve a higher standards of ethics in
government,'' Seymour wrote under the letterhead of his New York
law office.
   Seymour refused to comment about the letter to The Associated
Press.
   But in an interview published in Thursday's editions of The New
York Times, Seymour defended the speaking engagements, saying his
fee of $2,500 to $5,000 per appearance was ``way below market.''
   ``Look at it this way,'' Seymour told the Times. ``This is a way
to try to get a message out to the future leaders of this country
that they ought to be doing something about improving the level of
ethics in the nation's capital.''
   ``The ideal arrangement for visiting a campus is to be invited
to appear as a paid speaker at a scheduled student evening
program,'' wrote Seymour, who told the Times he had sent the letter
to ``several dozen'' colleges in July.
   Seymour's solicitation also was criticized as ``maladroit'' but
not unethical by Geoffrey Hazard, a Yale University professor who
specializes in legal ethics.
   ``It's just kind of tacky'' to solicit speaking engagements,
Hazard said. ``If it's fitting that he give speeches at colleges,
he ought to let them think of the idea.''
   Stephen Gillers, a legal ethics expert who teaches at New York
University Law School, said he would not have solicited the
speaking engagements before Deaver's sentencing to avoid any
misperception of impropriety.
   ``I have no problem with his decision to try to become a
spokesman on government ethics and to charge for it,'' Gillers said.
   The only issue is whether to wait until after Deaver is
sentenced to avoid any appearance of trying to cash in on the case,
Gillers said.
   ``In my view it was a question of judgment. Seymour could
reasonably have concluded that a July announcement would not
reasonably create an appearance of impropriety.''
   Seymour drew criticism last year when he delivered an emotional
attack on what he termed the low state of government ethics in
Washington.
   The speech was delivered on the steps of the U.S. Courthouse a
day after Deaver was convicted of three counts of lying to a grand
jury and a House subcommittee that investigated his lobbying
activities.
   Deaver, former deputy White House chief of staff and a longtime
friend of President Reagan, last week received a suspended
three-year sentence and a $100,000 fine. He also was ordered to
perform 1,500 hours of community service during the three years he
was placed on probation.
   Seymour had sough imprisonment for Deaver, saying such a
sentence would ``have a deterrent effect on the ethics and conduct
of political insiders.''
   In pronouncing sentence, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson rejected this argument, saying Deaver was not found guilty
of illegal lobbying.
   But the judge barred Deaver from lobbying the federal government
for profit for three years.

<HEAD>Corn Sale to Soviets Announced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An additional 200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn
has been sold to the Soviet Union for delivery during the coming
year, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets in the last
month for delivery in the 1988-89 year that began on Sept. 1 to
more than 3.98 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of
corn would be about 7.88 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $21 million.
   A five-year long-term grain agreement with the Soviet Union
expires on Sept. 30, but that will not prevent further sales to the
Soviet Union. Negotiations have been going on for months in an
effort to work out a new pact.
   According to the old agreement, the annual purchases were
supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and
corn. The Soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million
tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting
as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to sales announced since Sept. 1, the Soviet Union had
purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn
for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the agreement,
plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

   U.S. black organizations announced Thursday a
``Buy American'' drive for the Christmas shopping season in a
campaign against what they called ``Japanese insensitivity to black
Americans.''
   The Japanese have been reacting to U.S. black appeals against
such insensitivity ``in typical Asian fashion _ they have been very
polite, but nothing has happened,'' Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif.,
chairman of the congressional black caucus, told reporters.
   The campaign was formulated at a meeting of leading U.S. black
political, business and civil rights organizations earlier this
month.
   Part of the Japanese insensitivity is racial, Dymally said,
recalling critical remarks about U.S. blacks by former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and former Finance Minister Michio
Watanabe, for which they later apologized. Watanabe, who told a
party meeting last July that American blacks seem unconcerned about
declaring bankruptcy, may be Japan's next prime minister, the
congressman said.
   With Dymally at a news conference were representatives of the
National Urban League, the National Association for Advancement of
Colored People and the Black Business Council, three of more than
two dozen supporting organizations.
   Black Business Council Representative Kent Amos said the ``Buy
American'' effort called for the heaviest shopping season of the
year is not a boycott but an effort to divert part of American
blacks' $300 billion annual purchasing power to ``companies in
America responsive to our needs....''
   ``We as a black community have been through the process of
sensitizing insensitive communities before,'' Amos said. ``In the
1960s and 1970s, it was corporate America. ... We are much further
along in our understanding of our economic role now, and we won't
be as patient. We are willing to assist anyone willing to listen,
but not enough people are willing ... and until that happens we
will continue to have confrontation.''
   The campaign will include pressure to persuade Japanese-owned
businesses and factories now proliferating in the United States to
hire more blacks at all levels, Dymally said.
   American vice presidents of such firms are failing to convince
their Japanese bosses that ``this is America, and we have
affirmative action goals,'' he said. Japanese auto firms with the
exception of Toyota have no black-owned dealerships and Japanese
investors are giving no business to black real estate firms or
banks, he asserted.
   For new factories, ``every Japanese automobile manufacturer
seeks rural South America or suburban North America, as far as they
can get from urban centers where there is a surplus of labor and
where minorities live,'' Dymally charged.
   ``We want to be conciliatory,'' Dymally said, adding that the
first objective of the campaign is a dialogue between Japanese
government and corporate officials and the U.S. black community.
But Dymally said it has been difficult to engage the Japanese side
in dialogue.
   Racial insensitivity in Japan is being fought by ``some
enlightened people in the government and some corporations are
taking the right steps,'' Amos said.
   ``If all would follow the lead of Sony (electronics) and Toyota,
we would be much further along,'' he said, but did not clarify how
those firms could be spared potential loss caused by a ``Buy
American'' campaign.
   The Black Business Council seeks Japanese investment targeted at
revival of decaying U.S. inner cities and its president, Al Nellum,
will be pursuing this in Tokyo next week, Amos said.

Problem</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Soviets saying future peacekeeping
jeapardized by Pakistan's alleged violations of Afghan pact.

<TEXT>
   On the day U.N. peacekeepers won the Nobel
Peace Prize, a Soviet official on Thursday said failure to take
seriously Pakistan's alleged violations of the Afghan pact could
mean ``difficulties'' for future peacekeeping.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the spokesman of the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
said U.N. peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan are ``not doing their
job properly'' and should be investigated by the secretary-general
if future peacekeeping forces are to be approved.
   The Soviet Union, one of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, has the power to veto new U.N. peacekeeping
proposals. The other permanent members are United States, Britain,
France and China.
   The foreign ministers of the permanent members met Wednesday
evening at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze to discuss Soviet claims that the United States and
Pakistan are violating the U.N.-mediated Afghan accords signed in
Geneva on April 14.
   Those accords call for the Soviets to withdraw more than 100,000
Red Army troops from Afghanistan, and for Afghanistan and Pakistan
to respect each other's territorial integrity.
   ``If we do not succeed in creating an efficient control
mechanism here in Afghanistan, which is kind of a testing ground,
then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism
in other conflicts,'' said Gerasimov.
   The ``mechanism'' he referred to is the U.N. military observer
group monitoring the Soviet withdrawal and alleged violations of
the accords.
   On Tuesday, Shevardnaze said the Soviets had finished the first
part of their troop withdrawal, but had not yet begun the second
phase, and said it depended on whether the violations of the accord
cease.
   When asked Thursday if the Soviets were slowing their retreat,
Gerasimov said: ``We don't want to be too specific, but we are
worried. ... These violations must be stopped.''
   U.N. observers determined that half the Soviet troops had
withdrawn by Aug. 15, so Shevardnadze's statement meant the Red
Army retreat has stopped for the last six weeks.
   The withdrawal began May 15 and is to be complete by next Feb.
15.
   Gerasimov said Pakistan armed the Afghan guerrillas and was
allowing at least two training camps to operate on its territory
for about 3,400 fighters.
   He said 2,500 Afghan fighters were in training near Islamabad,
the Pakistani capital, and 900 others at a base near the Afghan
border with the assistance of Chinese, American and Pakistani
advisers.
   The Soviet spokesman also accused Pakistani authorities of
patroling refugee camps to stop Afghans from returning to their
homeland.
   The spokesman called for a detailed report from the United
Nations, which has stationed observers in Afghanistan.
   At the U.N. session Wednesday night, Shultz said Soviet and
Afghan pilots violated Pakistani territory with bombing raids.
   Gerasimov acknowledged that a Soviet pilot was downed in
Pakistan a few weeks ago. He thanked the Pakistani government for
returning him.
   Otherwise, the Soviet official said, ``there is no intrusion,
and we are saying it all the time. It is really not true.''
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to back a
Marxist government. They stayed on to help the government fight a
Moslem insurgency.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill To Upgrade U.S. Spy Capability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan, saying secrecy is essential
for the nation's security, signed legislation Thursday designed to
help modernize America's outmoded spy satellite network.
   In a statement announcing he had signed the bill, Reagan
predicted the measure ``will strengthen United States intelligence
capabilities.''
   The spy satellite modernization program was initiated by the
Senate Intelligence Committee after it concluded that U.S. photo
and eavesdropping satellites were becoming outdated. The nation's
spy network in outer space had not been substantially updated in a
decade.
   The precise provisions and funding levels of the bill are
classified, but Reagan said the legislation authorizes the
appropriations ``at approximately the level I requested.'' Total
spending on U.S. intelligence programs reportedly amounts to about
$25 billion. Nearly all of the money is hidden away in the
Pentagon's budget.
   ``As the Congress has recognized, secrecy is essential to
success in the intelligence activities upon which the nation's
security depends,'' the president's statement said.
   The Senate panel called for the modernization of the spy network
after reviewing verification capabilities for the new arms control
treaty with the Soviet Union on medium-range nuclear weapons. The
lawmakers found that U.S. monitoring technology would be inadequate
if the superpowers later reached agreement on deep cuts in
long-range nuclear weapons.
   Even though Reagan signed the bill into law, he cited
``constitutional concerns'' about two separate sections of the
legislation.
   One provision of the bill included language that prohibits the
government from aiding Nicaragua's Contra rebels unless
specifically authorized by Congress. The issue arose during the
Iran-Contra arms and money scandal when the administration insisted
that prohibitions on intelligence agencies aiding the rebels did
not extend to the president's National Security Council staff.
   The new legislation bars any ``entity'' of the government from
unauthorized aid to the Contra rebels, which would include the NSC.
   Reagan said he signed the measure with the understanding that
the extension of the restriction ``is not intended to, and does
not, apply in a manner and to an extent that would conflict with my
constitutional authority and duty to conduct the foreign relations
of the United States.''
   Reagan also said he was concerned about another requirement he

   The provision requires that the CIA report to Congress about the

   Protesters used tear gas and stench bombs at movie
theaters in Paris and several provincial cities Wednesday to
disrupt the French debut of ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   About 600 protesters at a demonstration called by followers of
excommunicated Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, a traditionalist Roman
Catholic, clashed with police in front of a Left Bank movie house
on the Boulevard St. Germain in Paris. One police officer was
reported injured.
   In Marseille, police said demonstrators were led by two
traditionalist priests carrying banners protesting the showing of
film director Martin Scorsese's adaptation of the novel by Nikos
Kazantzakis.
   Showings were disrupted in three cinemas in Marseille, one in
Angers, and one in Paris by tear gas and stench bombs set off by
the protesters. Customers were reimbursed for the price of the
tickets.
   Many other movie houses showed the film without incident, but in
Avignon four people rose shouting from their seats an hour into the
film, barged into the projection room and ripped up the theater's
copy of the film.
   In Rennes, Poitier and Laval, Roman Catholic groups protested
peacefully.
   Two other demonstrations against the film took place Wednesday
on the Right Bank of the Seine in Paris.
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the Roman Catholic archbishop of
Paris, issued a protest against the movie, but said he did not
support banning its showing and would not request or participate in
any public demonstrations.
   The Court of Appeals in Paris refused on Tuesday to order a
nationwide ban on showings of the film, which includes scenes in
which Jesus imagines being intimate with Mary Magdalene.
   The appeals court also overturned a lower court order last week
saying a disclaimer must be projected on the screen and read aloud
at every showing.
   However, the court did order that all advertising for the film
specify that it is not an adaptation of the biblical account, but
of the Kazantzakis novel.
   In Aix-en-Provence, municipal officials banned showing the film.

   Authorities detained a
Frenchwoman for 48 hours before ordering her expelled for carrying
what they called subversive propaganda, the woman, Beatrice Marie
Chantal, said Wednesday.
   She spoke to journalists at Treasury Police headquarters before
being released to French consulate authorities. She was expected to
leave El Salvador on Thursday.
   Ms. Chantal said she was detained Monday at El Salvador
International Airport after customs officers found in her luggage
tapes of Radio Venceremos broadcasts and photographs of
anti-government demonstrations.
   Radio Venceremos is the clandestine station of leftist
guerrillas waging a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed
government.
   Ms. Chantal said a Salvadoran acquaintance gave her two sealed
envelopes with the material for delivery to a French journalist in
Paris, and that she had not been aware of their content.
   She described herself as a lay missionary and said she had been
in El Salvador for a year working with the Roman Catholic Church's
health commission.

   During the four-day manned space
flight of the shuttle Discovery, enthusiasts across the country can
listen to live space-to-ground communications via AT&T, a spokesman
said Thursday.
   The ``Dial-a-Shuttle'' service is sponsored by the National
Space Society, but the organization is using AT&T's DIAL-IT 900
Services to establish the earth-to-space link, said AT&T spokesman
Harry Baumgartner.
   At 7:59 a.m., two hours before the scheduled shuttle launch, the
service became available to callers who dialed 900-909-6272, said
Kip Tarpley, a spokesman for the society.
   Callers can hear live conversations between the five astronauts
and mission control in Houston, Tarpley said. During quiet time,
news updates, commentary, taped interviews and highlights of the
day's activities can be heard, he said.
   It costs $2 for the first minute and 45 cents for each
additional minute callers spend listening to the conversations,
Tarpley said. Money earned from the service will be spent on
space-related programs, he said.
   The service is scheduled to end about two hours after the
shuttle lands Monday at Edwards Air Force Base in California,
Tarpley said.

<HEAD>Vatican Blames Catholic Community for Seminaries' Student Shortage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican said Thursday that some of the 37
Roman Catholic seminaries in America are ``starved of students''
because they are not getting adequate support from the Catholic
community.
   A Vatican commission, after a seven-year investigation and
visits to the college-level seminaries, praised the quality of
education offered to prospective priests but said the institutions
``are not receiving the support which they both need and deserve''
from the Catholic population at large and from America's bishops.
Several American Catholic seminaries have closed in recent years.
   The commission especially deplored the tendency of dioceses to
send priesthood candidates to small, local schools, known as Houses
of Formation, which do not have as high academic standards as
traditional seminaries. Students at the Houses of Formation receive
theological training but must attend secular colleges for their
academic work.
   The practice submits students ``to a philosophical formation
which is inadequate to the needs of the priesthood,'' Cardinal
William Baum reported in a letter read and approved by Pope John
Paul II and sent to every Catholic bishop in the United States.
   Baum heads the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education,
which was directed in 1981 to investigate the quality of education
offered candidates for the priesthood in America.
   ``We would urge all bishops who maintain Houses of Formation of
this kind to transfer their students to proper college seminaries
and to commit their resources, especially personnel, to these
seminaries,'' the cardinal said.
   ``Such slogans as small-is-beautiful, local-is-best are
disguising a situation in which college level candidates for the
priesthood are being deprived of the quality of priestly formation
which they merit and which the church needs,'' he added.
   ``The college seminaries survive because of the heroic sacrifice
and commitment of the bishops and religious orders who own and
operate them, but many dioceses do not send their priesthood
candidates to proper college seminaries with the result that good
as their formation programs may be many college seminaries are
being starved of students,'' Baum wrote.
   The commission also said that because of the dropoff in the
number of students, ``some seminaries are tempt to lower their
standards and admit students about whom they harbor reservations.''
   Generally, graduates of the seminaries attend theologates, for a
final level of training, before becoming priests.
   On another matter, Baum said seminaries must do job of teaching
future priests the ``theological rationale of celibacy ... based on
the example of Our Lord Himself.'' He said there was too much
emphasis currently on the mere discipline of celibacy without
attention to its theological basis.
   Baum's letter took note of the dropoff in the number of
priesthood candidate and listed reasons for it: ``pressures on the
family, the attraction of material prosperity and social comfort,
the sexual revolution and the growth of insecurity, as well as a
delay in the age of personal career decisions-making.''

   The United States and 11 allied countries
signed an agreement Thursday to build a $23 billion permanently
manned space station designed to serve as a stepping-stone for
human exploration of the solar system.
   The facility, known as Space Station Freedom, will be designed,
developed, operated and used by all of the partners, which include
nine European allies, Japan and Canada, in addition to the United
States.
   The United States is providing $16 billion to the program and
the other partners are contributing more than $7 billion. The
agreement was formalized at a State Department signing ceremony at
which Secretary of State George P. Shultz presided. Officials said
it was a coincidence that the agreement was signed on the same day
that the Discovery space shuttle was launched at Cape Canaveral,
Fla.
   Richard Smith, a State Department scientist, told reporters the
project is ``clearly the world's largest ever international venture
and certainly one of the most complex.''
   Margaret Finarelli, an official of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, said the Europeans countries, all members of
the European Space Agency, will contribute $4.2 billion to the
project, Japan $2 billion and Canada $1 billion.
   At the signing ceremony, Shultz said the station will be used
``to test equipment and techniques for long space voyages and the
development of new materials of great benefit to mankind.
   ``For the United States, Space Station Freedom will be the
centerpience of our civil space program for the 1990s. It is an
essential next step if the United States is to stay on the cutting
edge of space exploration and research,'' Shultz said.
   Earlier, Heinz Riesenhuber, the West German chairman of the
European Space Agency, emphasized that the project will be used
only for peaceful purposes.
   ``Together we can reach for goals that are beyond the reach of
each one of us if he tries to go it alone,'' Riesenhuber said.
   Twenty-two shuttle flights over a period of three years will be
required to place in Earth orbit all the hardware for the station.
Construction will be completed in the first quarter of 1998
although the facility will be permanently inhabited from late 1996
on, according to current plans.
   A State Department summary of the program said a manned space
station is needed to lay the groundwork for a colony on the moon or
a manned mission to Mars.
   ``It will provide a focal point for free world space operations
well into the next century and will serve as a stepping-stone for
human exploration of the solar system,'' the summary said.
   The station will be used to study the effects of prolonged
weightlessness on humans and to create a life support system for
long space voyages.
   ``Because it is being designed to evolve and grow, this station
can become the facility which will serve as a point of assembly,
test and departure for future manned missions to the moon or to
Mars,'' the statement said.
   The project will comprise a combination of permanentlty manned,
man-tended and unmanned elements. According to the current
schedule, the facility will be ready for permanent habitation in
late 1996.
   The basic structure of the manned base, including the power
system and the habitation module, will be provided by the United
States. Canada will provide the hardware for use in station
assembly, maintenance and servicing.
   The United States, Japan and the European countries will
construct pressurized laboratories, allowing astronauts to do
research in a shirt sleeves environment.
   In addition to the United States, Canada and Japan, the other
participants are Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Britain.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Activists Rally to Protest Police Beatings</HEAD>

   Thousands of Lithuanians rallied in their capital
Thursday to protest beatings by police who broke up two nationalist
demonstrations and arrested at least 100 people, a dissident said.
   Neither the official Tass news agency or Radio Moscow's
international service on Thursday mentioned the reported
disturbances on the main square of Vilnius.
   Valdas Analauskas, a correspondent with the dissident journal
Express-Chronicle, said a prosecutor refused to file charges
against those arrested during a demonstration Wednesday and an
overnight hunger strike on Gediminas Square.
   Most of those arrested were released Thursday, but a large crowd
gathered around the courthouse where the remaining 20 people were
to be tried in a closed court session, Analauskas reported.
Instead, the 20 were released.
   At least 5,000 people gathered on the square Thursday night,
carrying the flag of the independent Lithuanian republic and
banners reading ``Shame on the police,'' he said. A lunch-time
gathering also drew thousands, he reported.
   Nine Lithuanian activists declared a hunger strike Wednesday
night and remained on the square all night after police broke up a
protest earlier that day with armored personnel carriers and rubber
truncheons, Analauskas said.
   About 20 sympathizers had gathered around the hunger strikers,
and dozens of police waded into the crowd, beating, kicking and
pulling hair, Analauskas said. The demonstrators were forced into
two buses and driven away, he said.
   Analauskas estimated that up to 30 people were taken into
custody Thursday morning following earlier arrests.
   The initial protest Wednesday was against Soviet control of
Lithuania, one of three Baltic republics absorbed by the Soviet
Union in 1940. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia had been independent
countries from shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution until
1940.
   On Aug. 23, thousands of people gathered in the three republics
to protest the 1939 non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union
and Nazi Germany that divided Eastern Europe into spheres of
influence and led to the Soviet takeover of the Baltics.
   Baltic activists are seeking more economic and political
freedom. Some are demanding outright independence from the Soviet
Union.
   Analauskas said some protesters threw stones at police Wednesday
night.

   America's re-entry to space on Thursday
prompted more sighs of relief than cheers in Christa McAuliffe's
hometown, where residents hope Discovery will help heal horrible
memories of the Challenger explosion.
   ``This puts (the bad memories of) Christa McAuliffe behind us,''
said Craig Sargent, 20, a former student of the Concord High School
teacher whose death on Challenger 32 months ago plunged the city
into grief that still lingers. ``I think she'd have wanted it this
way.''
   Sargent watched the launch at Sears on Main Street, where about
15 people gathered in front of a wall of television sets.
   ``I was standing here in the same spot when it blew up,'' he
said. ``It's about time they improved it. It looks like they're
doing things right this time.''
   Sargent said that as a student, he sat next to McAuliffe at
Concord High School the day before she left for Cape Canaveral.
   Fred McLaughlin, who listened to a radio broadcast of the
Discovery launch at Haggett's Bike Shop, said: ``It brought a lump
to my throat, especially when they talked about just getting past
the point of the explosion of the last one.''
   McLaughlin, who outfitted McAuliffe's family with bicycles, said
the Discovery blastoff ``brought back some sad memories.
   ``I don't think that being in Concord, New Hampshire, we'll ever
forget about the shuttle. Every time there's news about the
shuttle, there will be apprehension.''
   But he added that each successful launch ``will make the pain a
little less.''
   Betsey Rogers, who watched the Challenger explosion from the
grandstand at Cape Canaveral, said tears came to her eyes as she
watched Discovery on television at home.
   ``I didn't realize how emotional this would be,'' she said.
``It's really very exciting to see a success _ and such a big
relief.''
   Rogers was in Florida in 1986 as a chaperone for a third-grade
class from Concord, which included McAuliffe's son, Scott.
   She and others hope the successful Discovery launch will help
erase Challenger memories.
   ``The biggest thing that is going to help is that that
(Challenger) is in the past and now everyone is going to move into
the future,'' said Clint Cogswell, principal of the Kimball School,
which the two McAuliffe children attend. ``We'll just be left
alone, which is just the way it should be. We're no longer a
story.''
   Cogswell said no classes at his school watched the launch, and
that he and his staff still feel a duty to shield the McAuliffe
youngsters from shuttle exposure.
   He said both children were in school Thursday and school
officials kept reporters and photographers away.
   Police officers kept the media away from Concord High. There
were no assemblies, though two or three classes watched the launch
on television.
   A hand-made sign in a second-floor window proclaimed: ``Godspeed
Discovery Crew.''

   Wind-driven flames crackled
through 6,700 acres of brush Thursday and roared past homes
abandoned by residents facing Southern California's first major
blaze of the dreaded fall fire season.
   Desert-dry Santa Ana winds blasted through canyons of the San
Gabriel Mountains at up to 60 mph, pushing flames toward an
1,800-home section in the Etiwanda district, and by mid-morning the
fire reached a schoolyard.
   About 150 people fled with belongings they could carry, but by
noon the winds had dropped to less than 5 mph and 10 aircraft were
able to bombard trouble spots.
   ``No structures are now threatened,'' said Capt. Erny O'Keefe of
the California Department of Forestry. None of the $150,000 homes
was damaged when the fire swept by, ``just a few dilapidated
chicken coops,'' she said.
   The evacuation recommendation was withdrawn by midday.
   At dawn, hose-toting homeowners squirted water on rooftops while
others corraled their children, pets and personal possessions and
headed for evacuation centers. But many refused to leave.
   ``They want to be sure it is really coming,'' Rancho Cucamonga
City Manager Lauren Wasserman said.
   The fire moved within 100 yards of Summit Elementary School,
closed earlier because of the danger, forcing officials to relocate
a firefighter staging area set up there, Wasserman said. Flames
later roared past and spared the school.
   While air tankers and helicopters were grounded by the swirling
winds, 1,200 firefighters on the ground made desperate,
often-futile stands on ridge crests they had cleared of brush.
   ``It gets to the top of a ridge and the winds carry it so fast
we lose containment right there,'' said Mary Grisamore, a
spokeswoman for the Department of Forestry.
   The 6,000-acre-plus fire broke out Wednesday, when it burned
down a $445,000 ranch house and two outbuildings in the area 60
miles east of Los Angeles.
   Officials said it was 30 percent contained, but there was no
estimate on how long it would take to put it out.
   Temperatures soaring into the 100s accompanied the Santa Anas,
the ``devil winds'' spawned by high pressure over Nevada that sends
compression-heated wind whistling through the mountain canyons to
sea. They are often at their worst just as fall brings cool weather
and rain to much of the country.
   The winds also temporarily cost firefighters control of a blaze
they started Tuesday to clear overgrown brush. That 675-acre fire
was expected to be contained Thursday night.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ About 10,000 mostly young Haitians
danced and chanted through the streets of the capital on Thursday
in support of the Sept. 17 military coup that ousted the government
of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   It was one of the biggest outpourings seen in Port-au-Prince
since dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France during a popular
uprising in February 1986.
   Most of the demonstrators appeared to be in their 20s. They
waved banners and placards bearing such slogans as
``Peasants-Workers-Army for Change,'' ``The Constitution Is Our
Weapon,'' and ``Oust Macoutes from the Church.''
   The Tonton Macoutes are former members of Duvalier's private
police force.
   The demonstration, called off twice last week, was organized by
six civic action groups. One of them, the Confederation of
Democratic Unity, a coalition advocating democratic reform, backed
out of Thursday's events because of fears of a reprisal attack by
Tonton Macoutes who are being purged from the army.
   Authorities arrested two men Wednesday and found submachine guns
and grenades in their luxury hotel room, local news reports said.
   Dr. Louis Roy, who helped write the suspended 1987 constitution,
said the demonstration went ahead despite rumors of a possible
attack because ``the popular pressure was so great. ... The people
are no longer afraid.''
   He said Haiti was ``ripe for democracy.''
   Rank-and-file soldiers who overthrew Namphy and installed Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril as president under a new military government
said they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence and
institute democratic reforms, including restoring the constitution
and elections for a civilian government.
   Avril has named a predominantly civilian Cabinet and has pledged
to restore the constitution. On Wednesday he met with Haiti's main
opposition leaders. He has said his military government is
provisional, but has not set a date for elections. He says they
probably will not be held for another two to 2{ years.
   Thursday's demonstration began outside the charred ruins of the
Roman Catholic St. Jean Bosco Church, where thugs wielding
machetes, guns, clubs and spikes killed 13 people and wounded more
than 70 during a Mass on Sept. 11. Soldiers who overthrew Namphy
cited the massacre as a factor in triggering their revolt.
   In the Dominican Republic, where Namphy and his wife and
daughter live in exile, Archbishop Nicolas de Jesus Lopez Rodriguez
of Santo Domingo said Thursday he opposed granting Namphy political
asylum or letting him stay there.
   He told reporters after celebrating Mass, ``I think that the
presence of this gentleman is harmful. To grant him asylum just to
get it over with would not be convenient either for the Dominican
Republic or Haiti, a people who want to get on the road to peace.''
   The Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with
Haiti.
   Speculation rose that Namphy would be flying out of the country
soon, but a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the government ``still
has not made a decision about Namphy's situation.''

   Within hours after Discovery
rocketed into orbit Thursday, the astronauts flung open its cargo
bay doors and deployed a $100 million communications satellite that
ground controllers will use to talk to crews on future missions.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, attached to a two-stage
solid booster rocket, was pushed from a tilt-table that was raised
out of the shuttle bay. The cargo waltzed away at about 2.7 mph
about six hours after Discovery's successful liftoff from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., at 11:37 a.m. EDT.
   About an hour later, the satellite was sent on its way toward
its final orbit with the firing of the rocket's first stage.
   But first, as a safety precaution, the astronauts maneuvered
Discovery 10 miles away and turned its belly toward the TDRS. That
was done to protect the shuttle's windows from particles flying
from the burning rocket propellant.
   Deploying the satellite was the main mission of the first
post-Challenger flight. Another TDRS is in orbit, but a nearly
identical one was destroyed in the Challenger explosion Jan. 28,
1986.
   NASA needs to get the TDRS in orbit because it will nearly
double the time ground controllers can monitor future shuttle
flights. The satellite now in orbit allows controllers to keep
track of shuttle about 45 percent of each orbit, but it has had
some minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percent
capacity, space agency officials said.
   The TDRS provides more continuous coverage of manned and
unmanned spacecraft orbiting the Earth than NASA's worldwide
network of ground-based communications tracking systems. The
satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft and a ground
terminal at White Sands Missile Range, N.M., which then routes it
to the appropriate NASA facility.
   The satellite is thrust into its final orbit 22,300 miles above
Earth by an inertial upper stage rocket.
   A spring-loaded ejection device pushed the TDRS and the booster
from the cargo bay. The first stage of the rocket fired about an
hour after it the satellite was released from the shuttle.
   The second stage ignites about 5{ hours later and the satellite
reaches its final orbit about a half-hour after that. It then
undergoes several weeks of checks before it is considered
operational.
   The satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about
45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard
a shuttle, Johnson Space Center officials said. The satellite
itself weighs about 5,000 pounds and it has two 50-pound antennas
that look like giant umbrellas.
   The TDRS' final stationary orbit will be over the Pacific Ocean
near the Gilbert Islands.

   One of the many satellites crowding
the orbital skies above the Earth threatened for a time Thursday to
affect the launch of space shuttle Discovery.
   When liftoff of the spacecraft was delayed, engineers in launch
control at Cape Canaveral announced that though the shuttle could
be launched as late 2:30 p.m. EDT, there were two brief periods
that were restricted because of satellites passing near Discovery's
flight path.
   Officials at the Johnson Space Center said they received a
Collision Avoidance warning from the Air Force Missile Command,
which keeps track of the hundreds of satellites in orbit.
   Flight Director Gary Coen said the warning had no effect on the
Discovery mission because the shuttle was launched at 11:37 a.m.
EDT, almost a half hour before the first of the two resticted times.
   Coen said the satellites that triggered the warnings were not
identifed by the Air Force.

   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   GEORGE BUSH, retorting to Michael Dukakis' recent barrage of
attacks on Dan Quayle's competence as president: ``I think it's
rather demeaning for their head of the ticket to keep going after
Dan Quayle. It shows a certain insecurity, a certain weakness on
his part.''
   
   Actor ROBERT REDFORD, joining Dukakis in an appearance at
Rutgers University: ``Hello, everybody. I'm Dan Quayle.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, blaming the Reagan-Bush administration for past
environmental failures: ``For the foot-draggers and chronic
polluters, I have just one message _ You better vote for Mr. Bush,
because if I'm elected the game is over _ no more of the sweetheart
deals and delayed cleanups and half-baked compromises that we've
seen over the past seven and a half years.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, praising the launching of the space shuttle
Discovery: ``It was a spectacular takeoff. OK, Russians, we're
back.''

<HEAD>Angolan Talks Fizzle, But Namibian Independence Plan To Proceed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S-mediated peace talks between South
Africa and an Angolan-Cuban delegation, which began with high
expectations, ended without an agreement Thursday and a new round
will be scheduled, a communique said.
   It said the participants will recommend to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that plans proceed for
the independence of South-West Africa, or Namibia.
   Thursday was the 10th anniversary of U.N. Resolution 435, a
one-year transition plan for Namibia's independence.
   South Africa has said it will begin implementation of the
resolution on Nov. 1.
   Conference sources said a timetable for withdrawal from Angola
of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops remained the big obstacle to an
agreement at the talks in Brazzaville, which began Monday. The
sources demanded anonymity.
   The communique released by all four parties _ the United States,
South Africa, Cuba and Angola _ said: ``The delegations have
expressed their firm intention to resolve the remaining problems
after consultations with their respective governments.''
   The sources said South Africa and Angola apparently accepted a
compromise proposal for a phased withdrawal over 24 months, but
Cuban diplomats demanded more time.
   Zaire government sources, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, meanwhile disclosed that President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire will meet Saturday with South African President P.W. Botha to
discuss a regional peace agreement.
   Botha and South African Prime Minister Roelof Botha, no
relation, were to fly to Mobutu's ancestral village in northern
Zaire near the Central African Republic frontier for the meeting.
   The sources said South Africa requested the meeting, which was
being billed as part of an African-led initiative to negotiate an
end to Angola's 13-year-old civil war.
   Government radio in Bangui, capital of the Central African
Republic, said a South African delegation led by Glenn Babb of the
Foreign Affairs Department met with President Andre Kolinga to
report on the Brazzaville talks.
   U.S. diplomats had hoped the Brazzaville talks would produce a
peace pact which would clear the way for Angola's Marxist
government to begin negotiations with its guerrilla opponents.
Civil war has wracked Angola since it gained independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   President Reagan told the United Nations on Monday that an
agreement resulting in a Cuban withdrawal from Angola was near.
Vice President George Bush cited Angola as an example of a foreign
policy success for the Reagan-Bush administration.
   South Africa has withdrawn its troops from Angola under a truce
negotiated during the present series of talks. It had demanded
withdrawal of Cuban troops within 12 months if it was to go ahead
with its stated aim of granting independence to Namibia, Angola's
southern neighbor.
   Angola and Cuban initially asked four years for the withdrawal.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Perez de Cuellar said a team
of 20 U.N. experts left Thursday for Namibia to survey that South
African-ruled territory prior to implementation of the U.N. plan
for independence.
   The Security Council met in formal session to adopt a statement
calling upon South Africa to free Namibia.
   The council noted ``the expressed readiness of the South-West
Africa People's Organization to sign and observe a cease-fire
agreement with South Africa.''
   SWAPO is a guerrilla organization fighting South African
administration of Namibia. South Africa's rule is in violation of
U.N. resolutions.
   Police in Windhoek, capital of South-West Africa, used whips and
batons Thursday to break up a demonstration outside the gates of
the territorial administrator, witnesses said.
   The protest was to commemorate the 10th anniversary of
Resolution 435.
   About 200 demonstrators marched from the main post office to the
administrator's hilltop residence. The noisy, but peaceful group
blocked traffic and police moved in with anti-riot vehicles and
charged the protesters. Some demonstrators and two journalists were
slightly injured, witnesses said. No arrests were reported.

<TEXT>
   The battle between Trans World Airlines owner
Carl Icahn and the carrier's unions spilled into Congress on
Thursday, with lawmakers dueling over whether a House subcommittee
should scrutinize the dispute.
   The two sides in the fight over Icahn's financial restructuring
of TWA spelled out their arguments at a hearing by the House Public
Works investigations subcommittee.
   As the session began, Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., said TWA's unions
had asked the subcommittee to hold the hearing. He said that Texaco
Inc. _ of which Icahn is the largest shareholder and whose
management he battled earlier this year in a proxy contest _ has
assisted the unions.
   Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri, speaking from the company's
offices in White Plains, N.Y., would say only that the firm ``takes
no role in these hearings beyond that of an observer.''
   Shuster said the unions had even sought unsuccessfully to have
the panel issue a subpoena to Icahn to force him to appear as a
witness. Icahn did not attend the hearing.
   ``I don't think it's proper people should try to use this
committee as a weapon in this kind of dispute,'' Shuster said.
   He and other Republicans said the hearing should not be
interpreted as supporting a Transportation Department investigation
of TWA.
   Democrats, however, said the internal changes being made at the
airline are worth examining.
   Subcommittee Chairman James L. Oberstar, D-Minn., said there are
``serious and legitimate questions surrounding the financial
maneuverings at TWA.'' He said it was appropriate for the panel to
study the carrier's finances, and the Transportation Department's
procedures for determining whether an airline's management is
qualified to operate the carrier.
   In August, the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants asked
the department to block Icahn's restructuring plan. The union
charged that the corporate raider simply wanted to extract cash
from TWA, ignoring needs for new equipment and threatening
thousands of jobs. The department investigation is continuing.
   Union leaders contended Thursday that Icahn acted for his own
benefit in initiating a plan to buy out public shareholders and
sell off assets, leaving the airline with $2.5 billion worth of
debt and an aging fleet of planes.
   Capt. Thomas Ashwood, chairman of the branch of the Air Line
Pilots Association that represents TWA's 3,200 pilots, said the
restructuring ``signals the beginning of a possibly irreversible
tailspin into bankruptcy.''
   But Mark Buckstein, a TWA senior vice president, said that since
gaining control of the airline in 1986, Icahn has turned around an
ailing company. He said Icahn has been exploring buying new planes,
setting up a domestic hub and adding new flights.
   ``TWA views this as but one step in its evolution as a more
effective competitive force in the airline industry,'' Buckstein
said.

<HEAD>US Demands Nicaragua Rescind Restrictions on Envoys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department called on the Nicaraguan
government Thursday to rescind new restrictions that force U.S.
diplomats who leave Nicaragua to delay their return for three weeks.
   Sandinista authorities informed the U.S. Embassy in Managua of
the change in procedures last week during a period when the two
countries were embroiled in a dispute over a proposed visit _ since
canceled _ to the United Nations by President Daniel Ortega.
   The new regulations require embassy personnel leaving Nicaragua
to seek re-entry visas only outside Nicaragua. In addition, a
waiting period of 15 working days was imposed.
   The State Department said the shift means that diplomatic
personnel who must leave Nicaragua for any reason, including
official business, family emergencies or medical treatment, will
not be able to re-enter Nicaragua for three weeks.
   Beforehand, re-entry visas could be obtained prior to departure
from Nicaragua with five days advance notice.
   ``We believe that the Nicaraguan government should rescind this
latest action,'' a department statement said, adding that
``appropriate responses'' are being considered.
   It also noted that the new measures aggravate the existing
personnel shortage at the embassy. Last July 11, the Sandinistas
expelled eight U.S. diplomats on grounds they were interfering in
Nicaragua's internal affairs. The United States responded by
expelling eight Nicaraguan diplomats from Washington.
   Neither side has allowed the other to send replacement envoys.
   Last week, Ortega canceled plans to visit the United Nations
because, he said, the United States would not allow a full
delegation to accompany him. The State Department contended that
visas applications of most of the official party were turned in too
late.

<HEAD>Life With Heavyweight Champion `Torture,' Wife Robin Givens Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to CORRECT that interview was Thursday, sted
Friday, and is scheduled for broadcast Friday; a longer version

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson has
been ``torture ... pure hell ... worse than anything I could
possibly imagine,'' his wife, actress Robin Givens, said in a TV
interview scheduled for broadcast Friday.
   Describing her husband's ``extremely volatile temper,'' Givens
told Barbara Walters of ABC's ``20-20'' that Tyson has ``a side to
him that's scary. Michael is intimidating, to say the least. I
think that there's a time when he cannot control his temper, and
that's frightening.''
   Givens gave no indication that she wanted to sever her ties with
the man she married in February.
   With a taciturn Tyson seated next to her on a couch at the
couple's Bernardsville, N.J., home, Givens spoke of their recent
trip to Moscow, where she was involved in taping for the TV show
``Head of the Class,''and of her husband's behavior.
   ``He shakes. He pushes. He swings. ... Recently I've become
afraid. I mean very, very much afraid. For instance, in Russia, I
was afraid. Michael is a manic depressive,'' Givens said.
   Givens said the consequences for Tyson would be dire _ even
life-threatening _ if Givens, her mother, Ruth Roper, and sister
left the fighter.
   ``He would be alone. ... And I don't want that to happen,''
Givens said, fighting back tears. ``He would have gotten so, so bad
that I think maybe one day he would have been more deliberate and
killed himself or hurt somebody else.''
   Tyson, 22, told Walters that he loves his wife and would not
stand in her way if she chose to leave.
   ``My wife would just have to ask for it and she has every penny
I have,'' said Tyson, a multimillionaire. ``She can leave right now
... take everything I have and just leave. She has the right to do
it. She has ... the power to do it.''
   Tyson, the youngest heavyweight champion ever, has had a stormy
year. He gave away a $100,000 automobile after a minor accident,
cracked a bone in his right hand in a late-night fight on a Harlem
street and was reported to have threatened suicide before he drove
his car into a tree.
   Last week, the New York Post quoted Tyson as saying he had been
diagnosed as being manic-depressive. The newspaper also reported
that Tyson had several violent episodes during his recent trip to
the Soviet Union and allegedly had chased Givens, Roper and a
secretary through their hotel.
   The Post said that after returning to the United States last
week, Tyson had a tearful talk with Givens, Roper and psychiatrist
Henry L. McCurtis during which Tyson admitted being out of control
at times and agreed to undergo treatment.
   Tyson, in the television interview Thursday, said, ``This is a
situation in which I'm dealing with my illness.''
   Givens told ABC that a distraught Tyson called Roper one day
``and said he needed help.'' Givens said her mother arranged for
Tyson to see a doctor and receive treatment.
   ``I don't know what Mike Tyson would be without my mother. What
we would be. I mean, she's been the glue that's kept us together,''
Givens said.

   It was billed as an effort to ``debug'' the
Lower East Side by getting people to turn in their cockroaches for
prizes Thursday. A sort of Roach Raffle. A Bug Bazaar.
   The big pesticide company that sponsored the Great Cockroach
Contest handed out free samples to make sure the little pests were
brought in dead. Banners were strung. Insect experts were assembled.
   The contest was sponsored by the Raid Center for Insect Control,
in cooperation with some Lower East Side community groups. The aim
wasn't to rid the entire Lower East Side of cockroaches _ just one
block of brick tenements on East 10th Street between Avenues B and
C.
   Raid handed out fumigants _ little canisters designed to flush
out and kill cockroaches _ along with tiny plastic, zip-locked body
bags for the deceased. A ``Countdown Headquarters'' was set up on a
vacant lot, complete with an insect zoo. And the contest officials
waited for the results.
   In the first couple of hours, about 10 people showed up,
gingerly holding their little bags in front of them. The roach
count varied, but generally ranged from about a dozen to 100.
   Each entrant was given a bucket filled with Raid products and a
T-shirt. And they were allowed to enter a raffle with a grand prize
that would range from $200 to $1,000, depending on how many roaches
were brought in by the end of the day.
   ``The main point we're trying to make is, you can't solve your
cockroach problem by just spraying once,'' said entomologist Keith
Kennedy. ``They've just been around too long, it's a sophisticated
insect and it requires some diligence to get rid of it.''
   Kennedy is a man who photographs bugs for a hobby and had no
qualms about letting an inch-and-a-half long Madagascar Hissing
Cockroach _ one of the prize specimens in the insect zoo _ crawl
around on his finger.
   ``That's a cockroach?'' a passerby asked, disbelieving.
   ``That's a cockroach,'' Kennedy replied proudly.
   ``Oh my God!'' gasped a woman, who sounded horrified.
   Kennedy rattled off cockroach facts. Sixty cockroaches weigh one
ounce. Eight-thousand weigh one pound. If a single cockroach gave
birth and all her offspring survived, she would have 10 million
descendants in one year's time.
   Near day's end, a flood of entrants appeared with cockroaches _
11,000 bugs in all. The grand prize _ $1,000 _ went to a man named
Mikal Reich.
   Eleven-thousand cockroaches is nothing to scoff at. Still, one
U.S. Department of Agriculture study in Florida turned up 27,000
cockroaches in a single apartment. At best, Kennedy said, the
contest may have exterminated half the roaches on the one block of
East 10th Street.
   ``We have been waging war against the cockroach for a long
time,'' he said. ``I will not suggest we are winning the war, but
we are winning more of the battles.''

<HEAD>Mitterrand Agrees to Host Conference on Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French President Francois Mitterrand on
Thursday accepted President Reagan's suggestion that France host an
international conference aimed at improving enforcement of a ban on
the use of chemical weapons, a U.S. official said.
   Rozanne Ridgway, assistant secretary of state for Canadian and
European affairs, said Mitterrand had voiced a willingness to have
the conference in Paris, although she emphasized that no date has
been set for such a meeting.
   Mitterrand met with Reagan, and then the pair walked around the
Rose Garden for about 10 minutes before joining top-level aides for
a broad discussion of bilateral issues.
   He stopped by the Capitol, where he urged Americans to observe
the bicentennial of his nation's 1789 revolution, telling an
audience that the two nations ``always go side by side.''
   Mitterrand was joining Reagan for a private dinner Thursday
night in the White House residence before the French president was
to head home.
   During a picture-taking session with Reagan earlier in the Oval
Office, Mitterrand was asked why France had apparently reversed its
previous position of wanting to keep a stock of chemical weapons.
   ``We wanted to contribute to general agreement on the true
cessation of the chemical use,'' the president replied through an
interpreter. There are already conventions (agreements) but they
have not been respected. Therefore, a conference is needed to do
away with that.''
   Reagan, in his farewell speech to the U.N. General Assembly on
Monday, deplored the use of poison gas and chemical warfare, saying
the use of these weapons ``jeopardizes the moral and legal
strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War
I.''
   Reagan said the tragedy of chemical weapon use in the Iran-Iraq
war should ``spark reaffirmation of the (1925) Geneva protocol
outlawing the use of chemical weapons.'' And he called upon the 125
nations who signed the agreement ``to convene a conference to
consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious
erosion of this treaty.''
   The conference that Mitterrand agreed to host in Paris would
deal only with the treaty protocol outlawing the use of chemical
weapons, and would not confront the question of production of these
weapons. This is being dealt with separately at the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva.
   Ridgway said the United States believed France should be the
host country for a conference on banning the use of chemical
weapons since the original copies of the 1925 treaty protocol are
kept by the French government.
   She said Mitterrand quickly acceded to Reagan's request, but
that ``there was no discussion of a date.'' Ridgway also said she
did not know whether the conference, likely a one-day affair, would
take place before Reagan leaves office next Jan. 20.
   ``France, of course, has been a very active participant in the
negotiations on banning chemical weapons,'' she said, without
getting into the issue of the separate talks in Geneva on
prohibiting the production of these weapons.
   Ridgway said she did not know whether Reagan had talked with
Mitterrand about the Americans being held hostage by pro-Iranian
elements in Lebanon.
   At the Capitol, where he witnessed the signing of a joint
congressional resolution commemorating both the French revolution
and the proclamation, also in 1789, of the Declaration of the
Rights of Man, Mitterrand stressed the links between France and the
United States.
   ``We were at your side at the very beginning of your history,''
Mitterrand said, invoking France's decision to send military aid to
the United States during the revolutionary war against England.
   Congress approved the Bill of Rights in 1789, and the
congressional resolution signed Thursday states that the two acts
proclaimed ``the sanctity of human rights on both sides of the
Atlantic Ocean ... guaranteeing them for future generations.''
   The signing of the resolution by House Speaker Jim Wright of
Texas and Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., took
place in Statuary Hall, a historic chamber which was the meeting
place of the House in the early 1800's and which now is ringed by a
collection of statues of American heroes.
   Several speakers noted that the Marquis de Lafayette, a
prominent figure in both the American and French revolutions,
addressed the first joint meeting of Congress in the chamber in
1824.
   ``I know this historic chamber is filled with the statues of
famous Americans,'' Mitterrand remarked, peering out into the hall
from a podium draped in red cloth. ``I can't see them because of
the television lights _ but I know they are out there.''
   After the 30-minute ceremony, the president of France went to
see for himself.
   Ignoring attempts to whisk him out a side door, he broke away
from a group of dignitaries and circled the room, peering up at the
statues and shaking the hands of people nearby.

   Federal regulators on Thursday announced the
most recent in a spate of savings association rescues, pledging
$281 million in assistance to a California institution.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it would provide a
promissory note of $238 million and various other forms of
assistance worth an estimated $43 million to Downey Savings and
Loan Association of Newport Beach, Calif.
   Downey is taking over the insolvent Butterfield Savings and Loan
Association of Santa Ana, Calif., and investing $40 million in the
deal, from which it is getting tax benefits.
   Butterfield, with loans and other assets of $541 million and
deposits and other liabilities of $694 million, has been under
government-supervised management since August 1985.
   It was one of several thrift institutions in California that
embarked in the early 1980s on programs of rapid growth, investing
deposits solicited through professional brokers into
non-traditional activities, including a chain of fast-food
restaurants.
   Butterfield's two offices, one in Santa Ana and the other in
Bakersfield, will remain open and all deposits will transfer with
the sale to Downey, which has $3.1 billion in assets and 42
branches in California, the bank board said.
   The bank board said it has closed or merged 116 institutions so
far this year. Sixty of those deals, requiring a government
commitment of nearly $14 billion, have come since mid-August.
   Two of those transactions have involved large California
institutions: Bell Savings and Loan Association of San Mateo, which
required $565 million in government aid, and American Savings and
Loan Association of Stockton, which is getting $2 billion in the
largest-ever rescue of a single thrift institution.
   The latest rescue comes amid intense debate over whether
taxpayer money will be needed to bail out the savings industry.
Congress' General Accounting Office says as much as $50 billion
will be required to clean up the mess, at least some of it from
taxpayers.
   On Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
blamed the crisis on Reagan administration policies which permitted
S&Ls to move from traditional home mortgage lending to risky new
areas. The campaign of Republican George Bush responded that the
Democratic Congress was to blame for cutting back an administration
plan to tap the industry, not the taxpayer, to bolster the
government fund insuring S&L deposits.

   A former state senator who authorities said
faked his own drowning and hid out on a remote island pleaded
guilty Thursday in federal court to racketeering.
   David Friedland, 50, entered the plea before Chief U.S. District
Court Judge John F. Gerry just four days after testimony began in
his pension fund fraud trial.
   The former legislator from Jersey City had been charged with
masterminding a plot to defraud $20 million from the pension fund
of North Brunswick Teamsters Local 701.
   In return for the guilty plea, Assistant U.S. Attorney J Imbert
said the government has agreed to drop the remaining charges, which
include mail and wire fraud, against Friedland when he is sentenced
on Oct. 28.
   ``We arrived at an agreement that was suitable to the
government,'' said Imbert, adding that Friedland faces a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison.
   The plea came during negotiations after Thursday's court session.
   ``Everybody got a fair shake,'' said Peter Willis, one of
Friedland's attorneys.
   Willis said he thinks his client will receive less than the
maximum prison sentence. ``I think he will have a life after
prison,'' he said.
   Federal authorities say Friedland staged a fake drowning in the
Bahamas on Labor Day 1985, just before he was indicted with three
co-defendants _ two union pension fund trustees and the fund's
lawyer.
   Friedland, a disbarred lawyer who had been convicted in 1980 of
taking kickbacks, was the subject of an extensive manhunt until he
was arrested Dec. 12 in the Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said he was satisfied
with the case's outcome. ``The court and the jury has been spared a
significant amount of time,'' he said.
   Chertoff said he was not entirely surprised by the guilty plea.
   ``In part, as he was confronted with what was unquestionable
evidence of his guilt, I think he was motivated by personal
embarrassment _ if nothing else _ to plead and put an end to the
proceedings,'' Chertoff said. ``A chapter is over in David
Friedland's life.''
   The three co-defendants were convicted in December of accepting
cash kickbacks from Friedland.
   Friedland and former Union County Assemblyman Joseph J. Higgins
were accused of defrauding $20 million from the Local 701 pension
fund through a bogus mortgage company they established in Florida,
according to the indictment. Higgins, already in prison for
racketeering, testified against Friedland.

   Up to 3,000 Olympics slides which were to make
up the bulk of photographs in the next issue of Sports Illustrated
magazine were stolen Thursday, officials said.
   ``It's the biggest athletic event of the year and this is our
picture record of it. They're our life's blood,'' said Joe
Marshall, director of photography for the magazine.
   The pictures were stolen from the front seat of a locked, parked
van enroute Thursday to the magazine's offices in midtown
Manhattan, said Louis Slovinsky, director of public affairs for
Time Inc.
   Marshall said pictures often are hand delivered by staff members
but were sent via an air freight company as the games continued in
South Korea.
   The stolen slides, chosen from 50,000 pictures shot by nine
magazine photographers on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, included
pictures of shamed 100-meter sprinter Ben Johnson, Greg Louganis's
second gold medal in diving and the U.S.-Soviet basketball game,
Marshall said.
   Slovinsky said the magazine would pay an unspecified reward and
ask no questions if the pictures were returned.
   ``These are extremely valuable pictures for Sports Illustrated,
but they are of no value to anybody else,'' Slovinsky said.
   The slides are each clearly marked as belonging to Sports
Illustrated and being from the 1988 Summer Olympics, he said.
   Slovinsky said photographs belonging to the Black Star
Publishing Co. Inc., a photo agency, also were stolen from the
truck.

<HEAD>China Says Cambodia To Be Top Issue in Moscow Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA CASTANEDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China said
Thursday that Cambodia will be the main topic on the agenda when he
visits the Soviet Union later this year.
   ``Of course, we also intend to discuss other matters related to
our bilateral relations,'' Qian said at a luncheon sponsored by the
Foreign Policy Association.
   Qian's trip to Moscow, announced Wednesday, will be the first
working visit by a Chinese foreign minister to the Soviet Union in
more than 20 years. The exact date of the meeting has not been
announced.
   Qian and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met
Wednesday at the United Nations to discuss the Cambodia issue and
relations between the two countries.
   China maintains that the presence of Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia and of Soviet forces along the Chinese border and in
Afghanistan are major obstacles to normal relations with the Soviet
Union.
   Qian has asked that an international peacekeeping force
supervise the withdrawal of 140,000 Soviet-backed Vietnamese troops
in Cambodia and ensure free and fair elections.
   ``The four parties of Kampuchea (Cambodia) should reach an
agreement for national reconciliation and form a provisional
government under the leadership of (Cambodian) Prince Norodom
Sihanouk,'' Qian said.
   ``We hope to see Kampuchea become a neutral and non-aligned
country.''
   The four factions include the communist Khmer Rouge; Sihanouk's
followers; the non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front of former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann; and the
Vietnamese-installed government of Heng Samrin in Phnom Penh.
   The Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot killed more than 1 million
Cambodians before it was ousted by the communist Vietnamese
invasions in late 1978. Vietnam, the Soviet Union and most other
nations want to guarantee that a Cambodian settlement prevents the
comeback of the Khmer Rouge.

<HEAD>Former Developer John Kroh Found Guilty of Bank Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former millionaire developer John A.
Kroh Jr. was found guilty Thursday of defrauding banks in an
attempt to get loans to keep his failing company afloat.
   A jury deliberated just over five hours before returning the
guilty verdict. Kroh, 47, looked stunned briefly but then remained
impassive.
   Kroh was found guilty of 13 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud,
wire fraud, receiving stolen money and forging his wife's name on
loan application papers.
   U.S. District Judge John Whipple said he would set a sentencing
date after a pre-sentence report was complete, probably within 30
days. Kroh could receive a maximum sentence of more than 80 years
in prison.
   No Kroh family members were present when the verdict was read,
including George P. Kroh, 50, who testified against his brother
under a plea bargain.
   George Kroh, a co-owner of the 77-year-old Kroh Brothers
Development Co., pleaded guilty in April to fraud and conspiracy
and served two months of a three-year sentence.
   The brothers' company collapsed in bankruptcy in February 1987.
   The government had charged that John Kroh falsified financial
statements to banks in order to obtain personal loans and then
funneled the money into his company.
   Much of the government's case was based on testimony by a former
company comptroller, Jacob Mondschein, who was granted immunity.
   Mondschein said John Kroh told him to do whatever necessary to
keep the company afloat. Kroh knew he was ``kiting'' checks between
at least four banks to cover mounting deficits and overdrafts,
Mondschein said.
   Kroh, who testified that he was never aware of the full extent
of his company's troubles, said he didn't know Mondschein was
kiting checks.
   George Kroh said he was unaware of the company's financial
problems until it was on the verge of bankruptcy and said his
brother handled that end of the business.
   Several bank officials testified they didn't question the
figures on the company's loan applications because of its solid
reputation in the area.

<HEAD>Thousands Raise Palestinian Flags At Former Mayor's Funeral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of mourners waving Palestinian flags
and chanting ``PLO yes, Israel no!'' bore the body of former Gaza
City Mayor Rashad Shawwa to his grave Thursday.
   The army imposed a curfew on about 210,000 Palestinians in eight
Gaza Strip refugee camps and in Gaza City neighborhoods to prevent
riots during the funeral. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers stood guard
on rooftops along the central Omar El Mukhtar street in Gaza City
and watched the funeral procession without intervening.
   Shawwa, 79, an outspoken critic of the 21-year Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, died of a heart attack
Tuesday. Shawwa was twice deposed as mayor by Israeli military
authorities but was considered a moderate by Israeli politicians.
   About 2,000 youths followed the coffin, carrying a large
outlawed Palestinian flag and chanting such slogans as ``We shall
die and Palestine will live!'' and ``God is great!,'' an Arab
reporter in Gaza said.
   At the entrance to the Amari Mosque, the largest in Gaza, youths
draped the coffin in a Palestinian flag. Five masked Arabs, waving
another flag, climbed to the roof of the mosque, cheered by the
crowd.
   At one point, dozens of youths started stoning Israeli soldiers
and reporters, but adults ordered them to stop.
   At Gaza's Maghazi refugee camp, two boys, ages 12 and 13, were
wounded in the legs during a clash with troops, hospital officials
said. The army confirmed the injuries.
   Another 12-year-old Palestinian was shot and wounded in the
stomach in a clash in the West Bank city of Nablus, Ittihad
Hospital officials said. A 23-year-old man was wounded in the leg
in the West Bank's Tulkarm, they said. The army said it was
checking the reports.
   Since the uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8 in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, 278 Palestinians have been killed. Six
Israelis also have died. Israel took the territories from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   On Israel radio Thursday, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron
defended the army's use of plastic bullets against Palestinian
demonstrators, saying it enabled soldiers ``to break up protests
with minimal casualties.''
   His comments followed sharp rebukes by the United States and
Britain and charges by United Nations officials that plastic
bullets caused casualties to soar.
   The army introduced plastic bullets last month to allow soldiers
to shoot at ringleaders while keeping out of the range of the
stones.
   Palestinian hospital officials in Gaza Strip said three
Palestinians were killed by plastic bullets on Tuesday. Israeli
army officials, speaking anonymously, confirmed the new weapon
caused at least two of the deaths.
   Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners rioted Wednesday at Ketziot
prison camp in Israel's Negev desert, hurling rocks at two lookout
posts and injuring an Israeli soldier, the daily Haaretz reported.
   It said the riot broke out after soldiers tried to handcuff a
prisoner caught outside his tent at night, allegedly without
permission.
   ``They (the prisoners) just raised their voices and fists. Then
they calmed down. Nobody was hurt,'' said an army spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Republican George Bush accused
presidential rival Michael Dukakis of ``demagoguery'' Thursday,
saying the Democrat had criticized him for taking a Social Security
stance Dukakis himself had taken.
   Bush, who cast a tie-breaking Senate vote in 1985 to approve
legislation that included a one-year freeze on Social Security
cost-of-living adjustments, said that Dukakis, in a vote on a
National Governors Conference resolution, supported ``exactly the
same thing he was attacking me on the other night.''
   Dukakis acknowledged Thursday night that at a National Governors
Association meeting in 1985, he first voted to drop Social Security
from a list of programs to be covered by a proposed one-year freeze
in cost-of-living increases. Dukakis said he lent his support for
the overall freeze after the attempt to protect Social Security
increases was voted down.
   The Massachusetts governor said in Dallas that he cast the vote
``as a general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I made
it very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-living
increases for Social Security recipients.''
   ``There were a great many of us (governors) who opposed any cut
in Social Security, but we at least wanted to give the
administration a message that we were concerned about the
deficit,'' he said.
   Bush commented in a news conference, his first in two weeks, and
also hit back at Dukakis on other recent criticism leveled by the
Democratic candidate:
   _Bush defended running mate Dan Quayle, suggesting it ``shows a
certain insecurity, a certain weakness'' for Dukakis to attack the
No. 2 man on the presidential ticket.
   _He also rejected Dukakis' reference to a ``Hall of Shame'' in
the Reagan-Bush administration of officials who have been convicted
of crimes or otherwise left office under a cloud. The vice
president said, ``How indelicate of him to mention such a subject.
... I could hardly believe it, but this from the same man that
attacked our president by that vicious, horrible analogy of a fish
rotting from the head down.''
   Dukakis said last summer that President Reagan and Bush must
both accept responsibility for the Pentagon procurement scandal and
other administration problems. He said, ``There's an old Greek
saying and I suspect the Italians have the same one. You know: `The
fish rots from the head first.' It starts from the top.''
   On Social Security, Bush denied he would ``raid'' the system as
Dukakis has suggested. And he said, ``I was a little surprised to
see this demagoguery from the man who had exactly the same position
that the president had on that one-year slipping of the COLAs.''
   Bush opened his campaign day by seizing the space shuttle launch
as a symbol for his campaign, telling a flag-waving crowd in St.
Charles, Mo., that ``We're back. America is back.''
   Bush later said he hoped he could attend next week's shuttle
landing in California, which would be a telegenic event for his
campaign.
   Asked if he would invite Dukakis to also be at the landing, Bush
said, ``That would be making a political event of it _ the two of
us there. I certainly have no plans to do that, gracious though it
may be.''
   Bush also put some distance between himself and the idea of a
quick manned mission to Mars _ a mission endorsed in the GOP
platform _ and a proposal for a ``Mission to Planet Earth''
orbiting observation platform.
   ``I would stop well short of saying the first thing I will do as
president is going to Mars. As a long-term goal and objective, it
is an outstanding goal and objective,'' he said.
   Dukakis has made Bush's running mate, Quayle, a prime target,
questioning his competence and his readiness to step into the
presidency if necessary.
   Bush, who rarely mentions Quayle in the campaign, said, ``I
think it's rather demeaning for their head of the ticket to keep
going after Dan Quayle. It shows a certain insecurity, a certain
weakness on his part.''
   Bush said Quayle ``will do just fine'' in his debate next
Wednesday with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' running mate.
   Among the questions Bush was asked during his news conference
was whether homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children,
to which he responded, ``No. I don't think they should.''
   He said a child should have a mother and a father, adding that
there was ``much more love in a situation like that, lasting love.''
   Dukakis has stated similar views and has been criticized by
homosexual-rights groups for a Massachusetts state policy favoring
married couples in granting adoptions.
   For the first time, Bush suggested in a speech that Dukakis
would follow the recommendations of the American Civil Liberties
Union in picking Supreme Court judges, if he is elected.
   Asked later to explain why he said that, Bush said merely, ``I
think it's a good question to ask. All he has to do is say no, they
won't have any influence on him.''
   Bush spoke to a crowd of nearly a thousand people in St.
Charles, which boasts it is the oldest city on the Missouri River,
and then flew to Michigan for a rally at Macomb County Community
College in Mount Clemens and another one in Grand Rapids.
   Bush hammered Dukakis with one-liners.
   ``This is the show-me state,'' he told the Missouri rally. ``My
opponent acts as if it's the snow-me state.'' He said that when
Dukakis ended their debate last Sunday, ``It was so thick I wanted
to borrow that 24-year-old snowblower that he has in his garage.''
   He criticized Dukakis anew for his plan to cut the budget
deficit by collecting delinquent and evaded taxes.
   Bush said Dukakis would have to double the number of IRS agents
and ``set 'em loose on the American people'' to collect those
taxes. Dukakis has said he would add 6 percent more agents each
year.
   ``I just don't agree with his vision of America where the
government has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every
home,'' Bush said.

   Showers and thunderstorms brought heavy rain to parts of the
Gulf Coast and Texas, and much of Mississippi and Alabama on
Thursday, while scatter showers prevailed over much of the nation's
midsection.
   Almost 3 inches of rain in six hours at Meridian Naval Air
Station, Miss. Two to 4 inches of rain fell in Waco, Texas,
although the area is still more than 7 inches below normal for the
year, the weather bureau said.
   Scattered showers ranged over the lower Ohio Valley, the middle
Mississippi Valley and the central plains. Overcast and fog hung
over the upper Mississippi Valley, western Iowa, much of Nebraska
and northwest Kansas.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed over southeast Georgia and
northeast Florida with cloudy skies over the mid-Atlantic coast and
partly cloudy elsewhere across the East Coast.
   Dry weather prevailed from the Rockies to the West Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 45
degrees at Mullen, Neb., to 104 degrees at Norton Air Force Base,
California.
   The low in the nation was 5 degrees above zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   Friday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
southeast Michigan across the lower Ohio and Mississippi valleys to
Oklahoma and Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms were expected to be most numerous over
southwest Missouri, Oklahoma and southwest Texas. Widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms were forecast for Florida and a few
showers in northern Maine.
   High temperatures were expected in the 70s and 80s across most
of the nation; in the 60s to 70 degrees from northern Michigan
across the upper Mississippi Valley and the central Great Plains to
most of Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and Colorado; in the 60s for
northern and eastern New England with some 50s over northern Maine;
in the 90s for central Florida and southwest Texas and up to 100
degrees for the desert Southwest and the interior valleys of
California and southwest Oregon.

   Mission Control turned the heat on
the Discovery astronauts Thursday in an attempt to melt ice out of
a cabin air-conditioning system.
   The ice formed in ducts that feed an evaporator system used to
cool the cabin air while the space shuttle is rocketing into orbit.
   Another cooling system is used by the astronauts while they are
in orbit, but Mission Control set the cabin thermostat at a high
point in hopes of melting the ice out of the evaporator system.
   The temperatures climbed to 88 degrees, and the humidity
remained at a dry 43 percent. The astronauts were told to drink
water to avoid dehydration, but the crew members said the
sweltering temperatures presented no problems.
   ``We're not sure how much of an ice buildup we have,'' said
Lacey Veach, an astronaut who does the talking to Discovery from
Mission Control.
   ``We have the heaters on to help out with that problem,'' he
said. ``We're going to stay in that configuration overnight at
least and look at it again in the morning.''
   Veach asked the astronauts for their comments ``on the comfort
level in the cabin right now.''
   ``I think we're pretty comfortable right now, Lacey,'' said
Frederick Hauck, the Discovery commander.
   He said the crew had found that the two-story cabin of Discovery
had a cold room and a warm room, just as do many houses on Earth in
the winter.
   ``If we want to be a little warmer than normal, we come topside
(the flight deck) and if we want to be a little cooler, we go down
to the middeck. So far, we're in good shape.''
   If the crew follows the pattern of past shuttle crews, Hauck and
pilot Richard Covey will sleep in their couches in the warm part of
the cabin, and the rest of the crew will sleep in the larger and
cooler middeck area below.
   Among the crew equipment are sleeping bags to help keep protect
the astronauts from cold during their rest periods. But if it gets
too warm, the astronauts can change out of their flight coveralls
and work in shorts and knit shirts.

<TEXT>
   George Bush and Michael Dukakis chorused praise for America's
triumphant return to space on Thursday, then resumed their sparring
in a long-distance campaign fight over Social Security, the
environment and political etiquette.
   Bush accused Dukakis of demagoguery on Social Security, saying
his Democratic rival supported a move to curtail cost-of-living
benefits in 1985 _ the very step that the vice president has been
criticized for by the Democrats.
   Dukakis acknowledged Thursday night that at a National Governors
Association meeting in 1985, he first voted to drop Social Security
from a list of programs to be covered by a proposed one-year freeze
in cost-of-living increases. Dukakis said he lent his support for
the overall freeze after the attempt to protect Social Security
increases was voted down.
   The Massachusetts governor said in Dallas that he cast the vote
``as a general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I made
it very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-living
increases for Social Security recipients.''
   ``There were a great many of us (governors) who opposed any cut
in Social Security, but we at least wanted to give the
administration a message that we were concerned about the
deficit,'' he said.
   Dukakis stood with actor and environmentalist Robert Redford at
his side as he attacked Bush as a man whom polluters should love.
``Calling George Bush an environmentalist is like calling Dan
Quayle a statesman,'' the Democrat said in a two-sided attack
against both members of the Republican ticket.
   Bush came to the youthful Quayle's defense and then got off a
double-edged attack of his own when he scoffed at Dukakis' claims
of being tough on crime. ``If you believe that, he's got some
bottled water from Boston Harbor he'd like to sell you,'' the vice
president said in a crack about Massachusetts own pollution
problems.
   Quayle was in Washington getting ready for next Wednesday's
nationally televised debate with Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen.
   Bentsen campaigned in Tennessee, where he had hoped to watch the
launch of the space shuttle with a group of schoolchildren. The
Texas senator left before the delayed blast-off, but said later,
``It was a spectacular takeoff. OK, Russians, we're back.''
   Politicians love to bask in the glow of favorable news, and for
Dukakis and Bush _ as for Bentsen _ the successful launch of the
shuttle Discovery more than two and a half years after the
Challenger disaster was irresistible.
   Bush had concluded his speech to a campaign crowd in St.
Charles, Mo., when he learned from aides the shuttle had been
launched. He returned to the platform to tell cheering supporters,
``We're going to keep the edge in space. We're back. America's
back.''
   Bush said he hoped to attend the shuttle landing next week in
California. Asked at a news conference if he would invite Dukakis
to share the moment with him, the vice president said, ``That would
be making a political event of it _ the two of us there. I
certainly have no plans to do that, gracious though it may be.''
   Dukakis offered similarly upbeat sentiments about the shuttle in
New Jersey, opening his speech on the environment by saying it was
a ``very successful morning. As all of you know, the space launch
was successful. We're very proud of the astronauts.''
   So much for the nice talk.
   Dukakis collected endorsements from several environmental groups
and had sure-fire crowd pleaser Redford at his side as he
criticized the environmental record compiled by the Reagan
administration and pledged to step up the pace of toxic waste
cleanup.
   He said that in Bush's role as chairman of a task force
concerned with government regulation, the vice president had
blocked proposals to reduce lead in the air and to clean up toxic
wastes. He said that in eight years, the administration has begun
cleanup efforts at only 137 of 1,200 toxic waste sites identified
as national priorities.
   ``For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just one
message. You better vote for Mr. Bush, because if I'm elected the
game is over _ no more sweetheart deals and delayed cleanups and
half-baked compromises that we've seen over the past seven and a
half years.''
   Dukakis also tried to blunt the Republicans' attack on polluted
Boston Harbor, contending he had fought the Reagan administration
``every inch of the way'' in trying to clean it up.
   Bush said that Dukakis in a vote in the National Governors'
Conference supported ``exactly the same thing he was attacking me
on the other night (in their debate). So I wanna keep that Social
Security trust fund sound and I will do that and I will not permit
it to be raided for social spending programs.''
   Dukakis said during Sunday night's debate that Bush would raid
the Social Security trust fund to help reduce the deficit.
   Dukakis' own running mate voted twice for Democratic-sponsored
budget plans that would have temporarily frozen benefits. He
supported a plan in May 1984 which would have delayed
cost-of-living increases for one year. A year later, in May 1985,
he supported a six-month delay in the COLAs.
   Bentsen, joining Dukakis for a fund-raiser in Dallas, said he
was eager to debate Quayle next week and characterized the Indiana
senator as having ``a far-right agenda'' out of the mainstream of
American voters.
   ``And believe me, if the radical right gets its way, we'll be
living in the 19th century instead of aiming for the year 2000,''
he said.
   For his part, Bush sought to shield his running mate from
Democratic attack, saying it was ``rather demeaning'' for Dukakis
to criticize the Republican vice presidential candidate. He said it
``shows a certain insecurity, a certain weakness'' on his rival's
part.
   Bush, firing a barrage of scathing one-liners as he campaigned
through Midwestern battlegrounds of Missouri and Michigan, again
criticized Dukakis' plan to crack down on tax cheats.
   ``I just don't agree with his vision of America where the
government has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every
home,'' he said.
   Dukakis campaign officials say the governor's plan to collect
delinquent taxes would require a 6 percent increase of IRS agents a
year, far less than the doubling that Bush cited.

   Mission Control said good night to
the Discovery astronauts a little early on their first day in space.
   Their scheduled bedtime was not until 9:37 p.m. EDT, but at
8:15, Lacy Veach, the astronaut who works with the crew from
Mission Control, initiated this exchange:
   ``So we're going to say good night and not plan on talking to
you again. We certainly had a fun day working with you.''
   Discovery pilot Richard Covey responded: ``Well, Lacy we've had
a fun day too so far. We appreciate you all allowing us to settle
down here. We look forward to working with you all again tomorrow.''
   Veach: ``Roger that, same here. Good night from all of us.''
   Covey: ``Good night from America's spacecraft Discovery.''

   Government troops fired artillery and
rockets at Honduran military aircraft that violated Nicaraguan
airspace near the border, an official newspaper reported Thursday.
Honduras denied the report.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the governing Sandinista party, said
the Honduran aircraft were not hit.
   The paper accused Honduras of escalating tensions between the
two countries by flying over Nicaraguan territory. A Nicaraguan
Defense Ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Hondurans ``provoked'' Nicaraguan troops into shooting at
the aircraft.
   The newspaper also said the Defense Ministry reported two
shooting incidents Tuesday between Nicaraguan and Honduran troops.
It said Honduran troops ``harassed'' two Nicaraguan border
observation posts with 50- and 60-caliber machine gun fire.
   In the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, armed forces spokesman
Juan Sierra Fonseca called the Barricada reports ``absolutely false
and alarming because they generate tensions in Central America.''
   Eugenio Castro, spokesman with the Honduran Foreign Ministry,
also denied both Barricada reports and called them ``absurd.''
   Barricada said a helicopter gunship and an F-5 fighter jet from
the Honduran air force and a twin-engine plane without
identification recently flew over the border towns of Santo Tomas
del Nance, San Pedro de Potrero Grande and Somotillo. It did not
say when the incident took place.
   The report quoted Maj. Leonel Martinez, military commander for
the Nicaraguan provinces of Chinandega and Leon, as saying
Sandinista army troops fired on the intruders with artillery and
rockets but failed to hit them.
   Barricada said the incident heightened the possibility of a
military confrontation between Honduras and Nicaragua.
   Leftist Nicaragua and Honduras, a U.S. ally, have been at odds
for years over the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
The Contras have long used Honduran territory to launch attacks on
Nicaragua and for training, supply and base camps.
   Since the end of overt U.S. military aid last February and a
truce that began in March, the bulk of the Contra force has been
holed up in camps inside Honduras near the border.
   But Nicaraguan officials have reported a series of border
incidents, including incursions or attempted incursions.
   Martinez said the navy sank six Honduran boats trying to enter
Nicaraguan waters in the Gulf of Fonseca on Aug. 20. The gulf
divides Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador. He said a Sandinista
army officer, Lt. Pablo Blanco Torres, died in the incident.
   Barricada said armed U.S. vessels are common in the gulf.
   The newspaper quoted another regional military commander, Col.
Carlos Brenes, as saying Contras have tried to cross into
Nicaraguan near the town of Palo Grande in Chinandega province.
   Brenes was quoted as saying Honduran troops have been harassing
the border post at Palo Grande to provide cover for Contra rebels
sneaking into Nicaragua from Honduras.
   Brenes said the Hondurans have increased their troop strength in
the area, reinforcing the 101st Infantry Brigade and an armored
regiment. He said the Sandinista army has not responded with ``any
unusal military mobilization.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis sternly
denounced the Reagan administration's environmental record Thursday
and said toxic waste polluters ``better vote for Mr. Bush because
if I'm elected the game is over.''
   The Massachusetts governor defended his own record on pollution
in Boston Harbor _ an object of intense attack by Republican rival
George Bush _ and said in his cleanup efforts he'd had to fight
Bush and the administration ``every inch of the way.''
   Dukakis pledged an eight-year cleanup of toxic waste sites as he
accepted the endorsement of several environmental groups during an
appearance on the Rutgers University campus.
   He was accompanied by actor Robert Redford, who drew squeals and
cheers from the large outdoor crowd.
   ``Hello everybody, I'm Dan Quayle,'' joked Redford, whom Quayle
has been said to resemble.
   Redford, known for his outspokenness on environmental issues,
said Bush was ``co-captain'' of an administration that has
``consistently stalled or blocked efforts to clean up our
environment.''
   A crowd of students, kept to the side of the rally, chanted
``Bush'' and ``Boring'' as Dukakis spoke. Dukakis paused once and
said, ``We've got a certain amount of noise pollution over here.''
   Dukakis blamed the administration for environmental failures and
embarrassments, including the medical wastes that washed up on New
Jersey shores this summer, as he delivered a stinging assault on
Bush.
   ``For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just one
message,'' Dukakis said. ``You better vote for Mr. Bush, because if
I'm elected the game is over _ no more of the sweetheart deals and
delayed cleanups and half-baked compromises that we've seen over
the past seven and a half years.''
   ``If you're satisfied with oceans you can't swim in, air you
have trouble breathing and toxic waste dumps that threaten your
health, then vote for Mr. Bush,'' he said.
   Dukakis' barbs followed Bush's declaration in New Jersey several
weeks ago that ``I am an environmentalist.'' At the same time,
Dukakis ridiculed Quayle, Bush's running mate.
   ``Calling George Bush an environmentalist is like calling Dan
Quayle a statesman `because George Bush has been part of an
administration whose environmental policies are hazardous to our
health,'' Dukakis said.
   He began the day with a private meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand in New York City.
   His trip by motorcade to New Brunswick was interrupted when the
limousine he was traveling in had a flat tire on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
   After a five-minute pause, Dukakis was moved to another vehicle
and the Cadillac limo, its right front tire in shreds, was left
behind.
   From New Jersey, Dukakis flew to Dallas for a fund-raiser and
private meeting with Hispanic leaders. At a news conference upon
his arrival, Dukakis explained his support of a National Governors
Association resolution in 1985 that included a one-year-freeze on
Social Security cost-of-living increases.
   The vice president, campaigning in Michigan, accused Dukakis of
``demagoguery'' for criticizing Bush for casting a tie-breaking
vote in 1985 in support of legislation imposing such a freeze.
   Dukakis said he wanted to protect Social Security from the
freeze on a number of programs. He said he cast the vote ``as a
general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I made it
very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-living
increases for Social Security recipients.''
   ``There were a great many of us (governors) who opposed any cut
in Social Security, but we at least wanted to give the
administration a message that we were concerned about the
deficit,'' he said.
   In his speech Thursday, Dukakis blasted the administration,
saying cleanup efforts had been begun at only 137 toxic waste sites
of the 1,200 sites on the priority list under the Superfund law. He
said only 36 had been completed.
   He pledged that if he is elected cleanup would be completed or
``well under way'' at all the sites within eight years. He offered
no estimate of cost but promised to make polluters pay. Issues
adviser Victoria Rideout estimated a $13 billion cost to begin the
cleanup efforts.
   In a separate statement, the camapign said Bush, as head of an
administration Task Force on Regulatory Relief, led efforts to
weaken, suspend or kill environmental regulations.
   Dukakis defended his own actions as governor of Massachusetts in
regard to Boston Harbor.
   ``Today, my friends, we're cleaning it up,'' Dukakis said. ``In
the course of that cleanup, we've had to fight Mr. Bush and the
administration he belongs to every inch of he way.''
   He said the administration ``vetoed the clean water act twice
and cut the funding for our cleanup project'' and said the
Environmental Protection Agency ``took forever to approve our
cleanup plan.''
   Boston Harbor remains badly polluted and continues to have
barely treated sewage dumped in it. With Dukakis as governor,
Massachusetts officials filed for waivers to the federally mandated
cleanup of the harbor.

   A judge on Thursday declared a mistrial in the
weapons-possesion case of syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan after
the jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked.
   Earlier in the day, Judge Arthur L. Burnett of District of
Columbia Superior Court had re-read his instructions to the jury
after the 12-member panel said it was unable to reach a verdict.
   Rowan has been charged with using an unregistered handgun and
ammunition to wound a teen-aged intruder in the back yard of his
home last June. He faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison
and a $2,000 fine if convicted.
   Burnett said he was convinced that further deliberations would
not lead to a verdict. The jury had deliberated about nine hours
over two days.
   One juror, who declined to be identified, told reporters the
panel had been in favor of acquittal by a 9-3 margin. A unanimous
verdict was required.
   As Burnett announced his decision, Rowan, who was seated at the
defense table, smiled at his attorneys and then at his wife Vivian.
He had no comment as he left the courtroom.
   Claude Bailey, a spokesman for city Corporation Counsel
Frederick Cooke, said city officials had not discussed what action
to take if the trial ended in a hung jury.
   Rowan, 63, shot 18-year-old Benjamin Smith in the wrist after
Smith and friends had taken an uninvited swim in his backyard pool
in the pre-dawn hours of June 14.
   Smith, interviewed by Washington television station WRC-TV in
Massachusetts, where he attends college, said Thursday, ``My mind
is pretty clear as to whether or not he had an unregistered weapon
because he shot me with it, and there's not a whole lot of
confusion about that....
   ``I'm not gonna go pool hopping again,'' he said when asked what
lessons he had learned from the incident. ``My feelings toward
handguns actually have been a lot stronger since this incident.''
   The defense built its case around a little-used legal principle
called ``entrapment by estoppel.'' The principle holds that a
person cannot be convicted if he is prosecuted for following advice
given him by a government official.
   Rowan had testified that his son, Carl Jr., a former FBI agent,
was repeatedly rebuffed by police officials when he tried to
register the .22 caliber revolver used in the shooting.
   The city's handgun ordinance allows only security officers to
register weapons, although exemptions commonly are made for law
enforcement officers.
   Rowan's son also testified that city police told him he was
exempt from the registration requirements because he was a law
enforcement officer, and that others in his family could have
access to the gun as well.
   ``He (Carl Jr.) was depending upon the competence and
intelligence of those people that the District of Columbia put
there (to advise citizens on gun registration),'' Raoul Carroll,
Rowan's attorney, argued during the trial. ``He was entirely at the
mercy of the District of Columbia.''
   One juror who declined to reveal his name said that ``wrong
information was given to Carl Rowan Jr. and Carl Rowan Sr.'' by
authorities.
   Rowan, who is black, testified that he obtained the weapon from
his son in 1982 after receiving a series of death threats from
people purporting to be members of the Ku Klux Klan.
   He said his fears were compounded by frequent intrusions by
teen-agers who held late-night pool parties, usually with alcohol
and drugs, in his yard.
   Prosecutors contended, however, that Rowan was not authorized to
handle a weapon not registered to him.
   ``We are here simply because the handgun is not registered,''
prosecutor Thomas C. Collier told the court. ``The death threats,
the shooting and the issue of trespassing have nothing to do with
this case.''
   Police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a
door at the rear of Rowan's home showed signs that someone had
tried to break in. One officer also said Smith had been shot at
close range just outside the home.
   Rowan maintained that he shot Smith because he was afraid the
intruder was trying to enter the house.

   The legislature and the Communist Party's
policy-making body will shake up the Kremlin hierarchy in
extraordinary meetings this week, a high-level source said Thursday.
   The policy-setting Central Committee meets Friday and the
Supreme Soviet on Saturday. The meetings brought officials rushing
back to Moscow and sparked speculation that Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and his opponents would face off over his ambitious
economic and social reforms.
   Soviet sources said there was ``no crisis'' in the leadership,
but the abrupt change in plans of several top Kremlin figures
clearly indicated urgent or unexpected business.
   Tass reported Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze landed in
Moscow Thursday afternoon after cutting short a U.N. visit. Defense
Minister Dmitri T. Yazov ended a visit to India a day ahead of
schedule.
   The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament,
usually convenes twice a year after meetings of the 300-member
Central Committee. It last met May 24-26.
   Soviet media reported Sunday that a regular session of the
Supreme Soviet would begin Oct. 27, and the announcement Thursday
of a special sitting at such short notice was highly unusual.
   The Central Committee had been expected to meet by the end of
October, but one Soviet source said plans for implementing
Gorbachev's political reforms were proceeding ``faster than was
expected.''
   The source, a member of the Central Committee staff, said the
committee will approve changes in the party and the structure of
government outlined at a party conference in June.
   The reforms are intended to enhance the status of the party as
the leading force in Soviet society.
   The source called it ``logical'' that personnel changes would
follow any change in the organizations' format. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, Reagan administration officials disclosed that
diplomats in several foreign countries were told one personnel
change might be the elevation of Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev to a
position of special assistant to Gorbachev.
   Akhromeyev is the chief of the general staff _ a position equal
to that of chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff _ and the No.
2 military officer in the Soviet Union behind the defense minister.
   The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the administration
had yet to verify the reports independently.
   At its last meeting July 29, the Central Committee adopted a
timetable for overhauling the Soviet political system, which also
was discussed at the party conference.
   That blueprint calls for a new, full-time legislature and a more
powerful president, a post Gorbachev could take on.
   The first deadline set was October, by which time the Central
Committee said a draft law on amendments to the Soviet Constitution
and on multicandidate elections of legislators was to be complete.
In a Sept. 23 speech, Gorbachev said the party's 13-member
Politburo would convene soon to review the draft law.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev told a government
news briefing Thursday that the Central Committee plenum ``will
mark another step in realizing the decisions'' of the last party
conference. The Central Committee source put the focus on changes
in the party's structure.
   Soviet sources also reported speculation among high-placed
officials about possible changes on the Politburo itself,
indicating uncertainty even at high levels about the agenda.
   The Central Committee is empowered to make personnel changes in
the Politburo, the party's ruling body.
   The last full Politburo member removed was Geidar A. Aliev on
Oct. 21, 1987. Aliev was a protege of former President Leonid I.
Brezhnev, who now is harshly criticized for permitting corruption
and stagnation.
   The conference of 5,000 Communist Party officials held in Moscow
three months ago approved plans to limit terms of Communist Party
officials and a review of the party's 20 million members.
   At that session, one delegate criticized by name President
Andrei A. Gromyko, 79, and fellow Politburo member Mikhail S.
Solomentsev, 75, linking them to the abuses of the Brezhnev era.
   Some observers speculate that Gorbachev's backers want to remove
60 to 70 Central Committee members.
   Gorbachev repeatedly has criticized the party apparatus for
being too involved in daily government operations and argues that
the party should focus on broad policies and theories.
   Personnel changes could give Gorbachev and his backers a chance
to move out conservative party bureaucrats they see blocking the
Soviet leader's reforms.
   In a speech Wednesday, Gorbachev again pressed the case for
sweeping reforms. ``Any of the current burning problems underscores
the necessity of radical change,'' he said.

   Relations between China and the Soviet Union,
strained by nearly three decades of ill will, took a major step
toward normalization with the announcement that China's foreign
minister will visit Moscow this year.
   Qian Qichen's visit is expected to advance talks on ending
Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, the most serious issue dividing
the two Communist powers, and set the stage for the first
Sino-Soviet summit since 1959.
   The trip was announced Wednesday at United Nations headquarters
in New York following a meeting between Qian and his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Qian
``agreed to come to Moscow at the end of this year, where the
negotiations will be continued on the Kampuchean (Cambodian)
question and bilateral questions.''
   He said Qian will meet Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
that Shevardnadze would visit Beijing at a later date.

   The last time Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle
debated on television, it wasn't exactly a national media event.
But now the two are rival vice presidential candidates and their
performances next week could influence this year's presidential
election.
   Even as argument continues over who won the debate between
George Bush and Michael Dukakis, the two campaigns are priming
their running mates for next Wednesday's scrap in Omaha, Neb.
They're also trying to move public opinion to receive their
candidates favorably.
   Quayle returned to Washington on Wednesday night to begin
cramming for the 90-minute battle. Bentsen planned to finish his
latest campaign trip on Friday in Washington, and then go to back
to his native Texas on Sunday for final preparations.
   They're both reading briefing books, reviewing video tapes,
huddling with top staff and getting tips on talking to the cameras.
   Although the two men disagree over many policies, the main issue
at stake in the debate is Quayle, who the Democrats contend is not
qualified to be next in line to the oval office.

   The Navy's next new warship will be propelled
by electric motors instead of diesel, gas turbine or nuclear power,
the service's top admiral has decided.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, in a speech delivered earlier this
week at a classified symposium, surprised many in the audience by
announcing the Navy would no longer just dabble in research of
``integrated electric drive propulsion'' but instead would embrace
it as the power plant of the future.
   ``In view of its many well-known advantages, I am declaring that
integrated electric drive, with its associated cluster of
technologies, will be the method of propulsion for the next class
of surface battle force combatants,'' Trost said.
   ``And I am directing all the major Navy organizations involved
in these efforts to concentrate their energies toward that
objective. It's something that has stayed in the laboratory too
long, and we need to tear down those barriers that have prevented
its development.''
   The Pentagon released excerpts of Trost's remarks Wednesday.

   The conviction of three Mexican nationals in
a U.S. drug agent's murder in Mexico is being hailed by federal law
enforcement officials as ``only the beginning'' toward bringing all
the killers to justice.
   ``Our goal is to see that everyone who participated in the
torture and kidnapping and murder of agent Enrique Camarena is
brought to justice,'' U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner told reporters
after Wednesday's verdict against the third of three co-defendants.
   In Washington, John C. Lawn, chief of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said he will press ``the crusade for justice'' in
Camarena's killing, which authorities allege was masterminded by
reputed Mexican drug baron Rafael Caro Quintero.

<TEXT>
   Evan Mecham was thrown out of office six months
ago, but the former Arizona governor remains a defiant political
force whose supporters have shown strength at the polls and whose
thoughts of a possible gubernatorial challenge in 1990 remain alive.
   Mecham says he is doing fine and feels he is winning his war
against the political establishment.
   ``It doesn't bother me at all not to be there (in the governor's
office),'' he said in an interview. Besides weighing a run two
years from now for the governorship, he said he is still
considering a federal court appeal of his impeachment conviction.
   The April 4 removal of Mecham, a Republican, by the state Senate
put a Democrat, Rose Mofford, in the governor's chair and began a
period of political turmoil that some politicians say could
reverberate for years.
   In a bitter GOP primary Sept. 13, Senate President Carl Kunasek
and House Speaker Joe Lane lost their seats to Mecham backers.
Seven other incumbent lawmakers also were defeated.
   ``The Republican Party is devastated,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Alan Stephens, who hopes his Democrats can capitalize on the
troubles to take over the Senate in the Nov. 8 election.
   Although Meacham insists he is not motivated by a thirst for
revenge against the lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict him,
he has predicted a ``revolution at the ballot box'' this fall that
would turn many incumbents out of office.
   The ex-governor formed a group that has provided advice and
literature to GOP candidates who backed him.
   But among those who lost their primaries, according to House
Minority Leader Art Hamilton, a Democrat, were many Republicans who
tried to accommodate Mecham's policies early in his governorship.
   ``The fact of the matter is the Mecham forces do not accept 95
percent support, 99 percent support,'' Hamilton said. ``Either you
live and die with him all the way or they try to see that you die.''
   ``It isn't a matter of getting even,'' Mecham said, but one of
seeing the Legislature ``controlled by the people instead of the
power brokers.''
   ``Whether I'm in the office or not isn't the most important
thing in the world,'' he said. ``I have no real regrets.''
   Many of the legislators who removed Mecham after 15 months in
office say they don't have any regrets either.
   ``I would vote the same way, even knowing what was coming,''
said House Judiciary Chairman Jim Skelly, a Republican who headed
the impeachment committee.
   ``Philosophically, I liked what he was trying to do, namely stop
state spending,'' said Skelly, like Mecham a strong conservative.
But he added that the impeachment evidence against Mecham was
``absolutely overwhelming.''
   ``Let us not forget the chaos that existed when he was
governor,'' Stephens added. ``The state was going down the tubes
quickly. If I had it to do over again I'd convict him again.''
   Mecham was convicted of misusing $80,000 from a special
``protocol fund'' by loaning it to his auto dealership, and of
trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. The
fund was created through private donations to a Mecham inaugural
committee and was subsequently pledged for protocol purposes, such
as buying gifts for visiting dignitaries.
   Gov. Mofford and Attorney General Bob Corbin have filed a civil
suit seeking to force Mecham to turn the protocol fund over to the
state. Mecham, still maintaining it isn't public money, tried to
return it to those who donated it. A bank refused to honor the
checks, however, till the legal issue was settled.
   The impeachment conviction itself was the finale to a
governorship in which he was accused of appointing incompetent
cronies to state jobs and of making statements offensive to women,
blacks, Jews, homosexuals and the Japanese.
   In June, however, Mecham was acquitted in criminal court on six
felony charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan _ a verdict
he considered a major vindication. That trial required stronger
proof than the ``clear and convincing evidence'' required for the
Senate conviction.
   The conviction propelled Mrs. Mofford, the popular longtime
secretary of state, into the governor's chair, and she has been
widely credited with returning stability and competence to state
government.
   Lane, the defeated House speaker, said one of the former
governor's main problems was that he refused to work with the
Legislature.
   But Mecham appointee Max Hawkins insisted that the governor
``leaned over backwards to work with them.'' Hawkins still contends
there was no valid reason for the impeachment.
   ``There was a faction in the Republican party that was
vehemently opposed to Mecham,'' said Mecham's former press
secretary, Ron Bellus. ``It was very deep and very mean and very
angry. That group was out to discredit and destroy Evan Mecham at
any cost.''
   The new governor wishes the political turmoil would quiet down.
``I have a good feeling out there with the public. We cannot wave a
magic wand here and solve all of the problems, but we're facing
them,'' Mrs. Mofford said.
   ``I think too much attention is focused on Evan Mecham.''

<HEAD>Echoes of World War II Still Heard at Guadalcanal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUADALCANAL, Solomon Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Echoes of one of World War
II's most famous battles still reverberate through the jungles of
Guadalcanal as Australian army demolition experts detonate a huge
stock of Japanese and American ammunition that litters the old
battlefield.
   Occasionally, the war claims another casualty when Solomon
Islands fishermen are killed trying to pry open the rusting
artillery shells to get the explosives, which they use to stun fish.
   At St. Joseph's school, the students have been warned to stop
their favorite game of throwing old mortar bombs into a fire, then
running away to hide behind a tree to await the explosion.
   The Australians are committed to clearing the explosives from 22
acres of jungle down to a depth of 10 feet, at a place called
Hell's Point about five miles from Honiara, capital of the Solomons.
   ``It's a five-year program,'' said Sgt. Allan Mansell, ``and
when we've finished there's another area on the sea side of
Henderson Field that will take about 10 years.''
   Henderson Field, now the main airport for Honiara, was the focal
point of a U.S. Marine Corps landing on Aug. 7, 1942, that became
one of the bloodiest battles of the war.
   When the Japanese finally withdrew six months later, the United
States had lost 1,600 killed and 4,200 wounded. The Japanese losses
are estimated to have been 15,000 killed.
   ``When the Americans left at the end of the war, they attempted
to blow up their ammunition dumps,'' said Mansell.
   ``What they succeeded in doing was to scatter live ammunition
all over the area like confetti.
   ``There are probably a million rounds of 105mm howitzer shells,
mortars and grenades. We collected 2,000 rounds in one day.''
   The Australians, assisted by the Solomon Islands police, slash
the head-high kunai grass to the ground, clear the area of shells
lying on the surface, then use metal detectors to find buried
ammunition.
   They stack the shells in piles, attach plastic explosives to
them and detonate them from a bunker 500 yards away.
   They first warn the control tower at Henderson Field in case a
plane is overhead. The shrapnel slices through the jungle and into
the sky for more than 1,000 feet.
   ``It can be tricky,'' said Mansell. ``The whole area is
surrounded by a minefield, and we've got to clear that, too.''
   As well as saving the lives of unsuspecting islanders, the
cleanup will end a profitable sideline for islanders who chisel
brass rings off the base of the shells to sell for scrap. Some have
been killed doing it.
   Tourists have been stopped boarding planes carrying live World
War II ammunition, bought as souvenirs.
   The principal at St. Joseph's, where the building rattles daily
from the detonations, will lose his supply of shrapnel pieces which
he sells to tourists for 20 cents each to raise funds for the
school.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Japanese Produced Banned Chemical Weapons in
1930s-40s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Japanese researchers are unearthing a steady flow
of evidence of their country's production of banned chemical
weapons and macabre germ-warfare experiments after it annexed
Manchuria in 1932 and throughout World War II.
   Critics here say the government has yet to fully address the
Japanese role in the use of toxic gases up to the end of World War
II in 1945 or acknowledge the grisly experiments conducted by the
Japanese army's notorious Unit 731 in Manchuria.
   Hisashi Yamanaka, writer and collector of war documents, said he
has discovered official reports indicating that the Japanese
military planned wide distribution of poison-gas weapons in China,
in violation of international treaties Japan had signed after World
War I and in 1925.
   Yamanaka, pointing to pamphlets yellowed with age and stamped
``Top Secret,'' said, ``These are the most detailed, official
accounts of Japanese military deeds uncovered up until now.''
   The Japanese government has never denied the existence of the
germ warfare unit or use of gas weapons by the Japanese Imperial
Army. But officials maintain there is insufficient evidence to
determine the extent of Japan's involvement with gas and germ
weapons because all documents were destroyed at the end of the war.
   Yamanaka, 57, whose rummaging through old-book stores paid off
last year, said his find shows not everyone followed military
orders to burn their records.
   ``Riichi Naito, who served as an assistant to Lt. Gen. Shiro
Ishii, head of Unit 731, kept his records. After he passed away,
relatives unknowingly sold off his books,'' Yamanaka said in an
interview at his suburban home in Fujisawa.
   He said the documents state that Unit 731, based in Harbin,
Manchuria, had spread out to encompass 26 experimental centers
around China by 1940 and employed more than 10,000 people. They
also state that the unit was experimenting in methods of growing
disease-producing organisms and preparing vaccines and that it
conducted bacteriological tests on prisoners of war.
   Yamanaka said that when he found the reports last year, he
thought they dealt with something else, and so it was only this
year that he re-examined them.
   Nagasaki University's Keiichi Tsuneishi, a specialist in the
history of science, verified Yamanaka's documents and made the
results public at an international conference in San Diego, Calif.,
in August.
   Though news reports from the San Diego meeting were widely
published in Japan, Yamanaka said he doubts that those and other
revelations would bring a government response to allegations of
wartime excesses.
   ``It would make Japan look evil,'' he said. ``Moreover, there is
always the possibility that research is still continuing today and
they (the government) want to keep it confidential.''
   The government, however, officially opposes chemical weapons,
and it welcomed President Reagan's speech Sept. 26 to the United
Nations General Assembly calling for a chemical-weapons ban ``on a
verifiable and global basis.''
   Tsuneishi said Unit 731 researchers injected Chinese and Soviet
prisoners with typhus, cholera and a variety of other germs;
induced gangrene, did live dissections and froze victims to death
in endurance tests.
   After the war, Ishii, the head of Unit 731, was questioned by
U.S. occupation authorities but wasn't prosecuted.
   Tsuneishi and others maintain that the United States gave
immunity to such Japanese researchers in exchange for their data,
because the United States had only begun gas and germ warfare
research in 1944 and wanted to gain headway in the field.
   On the small island of Okuno in Japan's Inland Sea, Hatsuichi
Murakami, 62, opened a small museum in July _ as testimony to the
Japanese workers in the secret chemical weapons factory there.
   ``The residents of Okuno decided to open this museum to teach
others that chemical weapons are an outrage against humanity,''
Murakami said in a raspy voice. He, like many of his surviving
co-workers, suffers from respiratory illness, a legacy of the five
years he worked in the chemical factory from 1940.
   The military in 1939 deleted Okuno from Japanese maps to keep
its chemical-weapons factory a secret. The island, near Hiroshima,
is about 400 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The factory produced mustard gas, lewisite, nausea gas and
hydrocyanic acid gas for use against China.
   ``We produced some 1,200 tons annually during the peak years
from 1940-43,'' Murakami said in a telephone interview from Ocuna.
``There were healthy people when I went in, young girls and boys,
but we had to work long hours and the level of gas sometimes
reached danger levels,''
   Allied forces destroyed the factory in 1945.
   In mid-September many newspapers again carried news stories
reporting research by Yuki Tanaka, a Japanese teaching in
Australia, on people who worked in the Okuno island factory.
   A separate document released by Yamanaka and reported widely in
the Japanese press in September outlined military plans to
distribute gas weapons in China during the height of the Japanese
military offensive in 1938.
   Since 1981 reports have trickled out from U.S. and Japanese
researchers about World War II germ-such material
in school textbooks has become a controversial one in Japan.
   But the Education Ministry, which has final say on content of
textbooks, contends the evidence isn't conclusive.

<HEAD>River Phoenix and His Unique Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unique nature of the Phoenix family was
recently related by young actor River Phoenix.
   ``I was born in Oregon, my sister, Rain, was born in Texas, my
brother, Joaquin Rafael, alias Leaf, was born in Puerto Rico, my
other sister, Liberty, is a native of Venezuela, my other sister,
Summer, was born in Florida, my mother in the Bronx, N.Y., my
father in Fontana, Calif,'' he said.
   River, who just turned 18, added: ``Since I was 10, we have been
based in Los Angeles. We moved frequently from home to home in Los
Angeles, never owned a house. Sometimes we moved because our
financial condition was weakening and we needed a more affordable
place. Sometimes we moved because we recently got a part which
allowed us to get above the unpleasant conditions we were in.''
   Arlynn and John Phoenix worked odd jobs and lived the
free-spirited lifestyle of the 1960s. They were noncomformists and
loved nature. Today, they write and lecture on environmentalism and
work as farmers in Florida.
   Besides River, Leaf, 13, is an actor. The other children also
have done a little acting.
   The Phoenix family offers an uncanny parallel to the Pope family
in the current Warner Bros. release, ``Running on Empty,'' which
stars Christine Lahti, Judd Hirsch and River. Both families are
environmental activists and nontraditionalists.
   But there is an important difference: the Popes, husband, wife
and two sons, are on the lam. During the turbulent 1960s, the
parents bombed a napalm laboratory, inadvertently blinding a
janitor. The Popes have been on the FBI's most-wanted list ever
since.
   ``We were a little different from the motives behind the Pope
family and why they moved,'' Phoenix said. ``Obviously, they were
moving because they had to for survival.''
   According to family legend, River began his performing career at
the age of five on the streets of Caracas, singing with his sister,
Rainbow, then three. When the family made the move to Los Angeles,
he began getting television work, making his film debut in the 1985
``Explorers.'' His naturalness and dramatic intensity impressed
critics and young fans alike in ``Stand by Me,'' ``The Mosquito
Coast,'' ``A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon and ``Little
Nikita.''
   Sidney Lumet, who directed him in ``Running on Empty,'' said
Phoenix is in the transitional period between child and adult
actor: ``He has a surprising technique that he has developed on his
own; he has never studied acting.
   ``But he'll make the adjustment (to adulthood). ... He can play
a couple more teen-agers, but then _ who knows? He's a very
talented musician and writes beautiful songs. He's one of those
people who's so talented I don't know where he's going to go. The
world is open to him.''
   Phoenix views his peripatetic childhood as an asset to him as an
actor.
   ``I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new
situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go
from film to film,'' he said. ``It also gives you an insight on
different forms of life and different perspectives.''
   In facing new schools and new neighborhoods, he added, ``you
learn to blend in and to simulate what the others are doing and
apply that to your reality around them. By your doing so, they will
take you in. Without conforming and without compromising your
individuality, there is a way of being neutral and not running
things the wrong way.''
   How does he see his future in films _ or does he just take one
year at a time?
   ``Even one year at a time is too long a time span for me to
foresee. I'm very happy with what I'm doing, very aware and open to
changes, will accept them gladly when they come,'' he said. ``By
all means I am not tied down, nor do I feel the need, nor is my
security or my ego riding on this career.
   ``If anything, I would rather quit while I was ahead. I wouldn't
try to keep an old car plugging away if it's not working anymore.
I'd just get into another business or use that time to travel.
We'll see how it all happens. I think a lot of it is in how you
pace yourself, not spreading yourself too thin,'' he said.
   ``Every bit of it is a learning process. If I'm taking parts
that teach me to act out these cliche forms of writing and to live
these little molds because they're commercially successful, it
strips you of any unique flavor that you might have within
yourself.''

<HEAD>A Day On The Campaign Trail With 85-Year-Old Euterpe Dukakis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ Euterpe Dukakis is awake at 2:30 one
recent Friday morning, too excited for sleep. At age 85, she is
ready for another campaign trip on behalf of her son, Michael, who
is running for president.
   Her mostly elderly audiences marvel at the energy that propels
her through the once rich anthracite coal country of eastern
Pennsylvania.
   From Wilkes-Barre to Scranton to Olyphant to Allentown, Mrs.
Dukakis and four campaign workers drive past slack piles and fields
of morning glories. With only three hours sleep, she naps when she
can.
   Before the day is over, she will speak at four events, pose for
souvenir photos with well-wishers and give brief interviews to a
dozen reporters. She will work the crowds, clasping hands and often
speaking in her native tongue to Greek-Americans.
   She talks of her immigration to the United States from Larissa
in northern Greece with her parents and three sisters when she was
9 years old.
   ``We came to my older brother who came first when he was 18
years old and settled here. This is the story of all immigrant
families. Then he brought my younger brother and the two together
were able to bring the whole family,'' she says.
   ``I don't know where she gets the energy at that age to give one
speech and go on to another,'' says Jule Dobrowski, 70, who was
among 200 elderly residents who heard Mrs. Dukakis speak at the
Lackawanna County Health Care Center in Olyphant.
   ``I come from strong mountain people,'' Mrs. Dukakis said in an
interview en route from one stop to another. ``Maybe that's one
thing. My grandmother died at 95. My great-grandmother died when
she was 105. I have a long way to go yet ... This campaign has
really gave me a great infusion of energy.''
   She has traveled to two dozen states, some more than once, from
East Coast to West Coast, in the more than a year she has been
drumming up votes for her son, the Democratic presidential nominee.
She averages three days a week on the campaign trail.
   She looks like the Old World mother that she is, a plain woman,
short white-grayish hair, glasses, simple black skirt, peach
colored blouse, red jacket.
   As a matter of fact, only the Sunday before this trip, her son
went to her house, not for political advice, which she never gives
him, but for breakfast. She made blueberry muffins for him, which
he enjoyed, then filled a box for him to take home to his wife,
Kitty.
   ``She's a regular mother,'' says Mary Thomas, a Pennsylvania
delegate for Dukakis at the Democratic national convention last
July. ``She's a person you can relate to. She's a real person.''
   Matronly in dress and simple in speech, she is spunky in
defending her son against attacks from the Republicans including
his opponent, Vice President George Bush, and President Reagan.
   ``They're not true,'' she said. What particulary hurt her was
Reagan's reference last August to her son as an invalid in response
to Dukakis' denial that he had ever undergone psychiatric
treatment. The president said later he was joking.
   ``Michael had lost his brother in a terrible accident and he
also lost the election and he was depressed,'' Mrs. Dukakis said.
   Dukakis' older brother, Stelian, who was beset by mental
problems, died in 1973 when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver
while riding his bike. To this day the driver has not been caught.
Dukakis lost in his bid for a second term as governor in the 1978
primary election but won back the office four years later.
   Mrs. Dukakis is no different than most parents when it comes to
bragging about her son.
   ``Michael has been my joy from the time he was born,'' she told
200 people at the Wilkes-Barre Senior Citizens Center. ``He was a
very easy child to bring up. He loved life. He loved everything
that he did. He loved people and he has continued to and that is
why he is in politics.''
   Mrs. Dukakis says she loves campaigning and was disappointed
when she was grounded for a time in August because of laryngitis
and a bad cough. ``I love meeting people. My son gets it from me, I
guess.''
   She shows her enthusiasm after a luncheon of chicken and rice in
Scranton with local supporters. ``Too bad we couldn't push the
tables to the wall and start dancing,'' she tells them as she
hurries to the next stop. ``Another time.'' They laugh and applaud.
   But it is not all laughter. Even though Mrs. Dukakis says she's
never had one unhappy moment on the campaign trail, small groups of
anti-abortion demonstrators dog her wherever she goes with signs
saying things like, ``We welcome you more than your son will
welcome the unborn.'' Aides try to steer her out of sight of them.
   ``Michael is pro-life,'' she says. ``But he's not the same
pro-life that they are. It isn't that he's for abortion but since
it exists, let a woman make her own choice according to her
religion or her sense of morals.''
   At the end of this day, she has a 7 p.m. flight to catch at
Allentown airport. She wants to get home before 10. ``I want to see
Kitty on TV with Barbara Walters. This is an important night, sir.''
   But the flight is an hour late late because of thunderstorms.
She sits in the airport lounge watching her son on the television
news. Finally, she is airborne and arrives back home in Brookline,
Mass., just moments before 10.

<HEAD>Steppenwolf Tackles a Stage Version of `The Grapes of Wrath'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 50 years after the Joad family made that
memorable trek from dry and dusty Oklahoma to the fertile farmlands
of California, ``The Grapes of Wrath'' has made a new journey from
page to stage.
   It's not the first theater adaptation of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck, but the Steppenwolf Theater
Company production at the Royal-George Theater, which closes Oct.
30, is certainly the most expensive. The $500,000 project also has
the enthusiastic support of Elaine Steinbeck, the author's widow.
   The play stars two of the Steppenwolf troupe's biggest names,
Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney, as well as guest artist Lois Smith as
the indomitable Ma Joad.
   AT&T picked up part of the tab for the three-hour production
which has a cast of 41, including four musicians who play an
original score by Michael Smith. They perform on a spare,
wooden-plank setting designed by Kevin Rigdon, who also did the
costumes and lighting. The rough-hewn set covers the floor and back
wall of the large stage.
   But the man most responsible for the play, as well as its
direction, is Frank Galati, a Chicago jack of all-theatrical trades
who acts, writes, directs and teaches. The 44-year-old Galati first
read ``The Grapes of Wrath'' in high school.
   ``It affected me in a number of ways that I've only begun to
understand in the last couple of years,'' he said. ``It turned me
in the direction of literature, and my whole academic life as a
student and as a teacher has been involved in the study of
fiction.''
   Galati began adapting novels for the stage as a teacher at
Northwestern University, where he directed a summer program that
took students through the process.
   One novel he wanted to adapt was ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' but he
couldn't get the rights. The idea lay dormant until Sinise, at the
time Steppenwolf's artistic director, invited Galati to submit
suggestions for possible productions.
   ``I thought `The Grapes of Wrath' would offer wonderful
opportunities for an ensemble of exceptional actors,'' Galati said.
Sinise, who had had some success with a production of Steinbeck's
``Of Mice and Men'' a few years earlier, agreed.
   The Steinbeck estate, after extended negotiations, granted
permission. By January of this year, Galati had done two drafts and
began a third version after Randall Arney, Steppenwolf's artistic
director and Stephen Eich, its managing director, decided to open
the company's fall season with the work.
   How does one boil down a sprawling novel of 30 chapters and
nearly 600 pages? Galati started with a careful rereading.
   ``I needed to see the flow of the book,'' he said,
``particularly, those incidents and episodes and characters that
come to the surface as tent poles, a kind of spine on which the
rest of the action hangs.''
   The novel, Galati says, is kind of an American ballad, and poses
particular problems for a dramatist.
   ``On stage you're stuck with having to get a truck full of 13
people from Oklahoma to California by moving it a few feet,'' he
said. ``That compression, and telescoping and distortion of time
and space is a very significant problem.
   ``The book has an A-B, A-B form of alternating chapters that go
from the general to the specific. Steinbeck does a kind of
landscape painting. Voice by voice, you get the sense of the great
numbers of characters who are part of the epoch he was reflecting _
the migrant workers, the land bosses, the contractors, the labor
organizers, the businessmen. You also get a panorama of the Dust
Bowl _ Highway 66 from Oklahoma to California.''
   These broad scenes alternate with the stories of the Joad
family, their immediate concerns and the characters they meet.
   ``Steinbeck had a remarkable way, and very experimental for its
time, of letting scenes take their own natural time,'' Galati said.
``People in the novel don't come to conclusions quickly. There are
some cataclysmic scenes and events, of course, but very often
dialogue and rhetoric move at a leisurely pace which I was
interested in retaining without sacrificing the need for urgency in
the drama.''
   Galati needed to find a framework to dramatize the more general
chapters. He found his answer in music.
   ``I contacted Smith, a wonderful Chicago composer and folk
singer, and gave him sections of the novel that I had condensed
into lyrics and asked him to set those lyrics to music which he did
over the course of the summer,'' Galati says.
   Have their efforts paid off?
   The major Chicago reviews were divided about the show's merits.
In the Chicago Sun-Times, Hedy Weiss called the production
``breathtaking and emotionally wrenching ... it would be an
unpardonable sin if it did not receive an extended life, both in
this country and abroad.'' Although the Chicago Tribune's Richard
Christiansen described the play as ``reverent'' and ``ambitious,''
he said ``admiration for its effort must give way to disappointment
in its results.''
   Galati feels ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' both as a novel and a
stage play, holds a particular relevance for people in 1988.
   ``There is this uncanny coincidence of the summer drought
devastating American agriculture,'' he says. ``And there's the
theme of literally sacrificing the land, abusing and destroying the
environment for the sake of capital gains. And we've still got
migrant workers as the lowest rung of the social and economic
ladder. Those themes remain as resonant today as they were in
1939.''

   Despite grim predictions, the city escaped
economic disaster following the 1987 stock market crash and made a
``relatively soft landing,'' officials and economic experts say.
   Though the financial sector was hit with layoffs and the city
responded with budgetary belt tightening in the form of a hiring
freeze and tax increases, worst-case scenarios never materialized.
   ``This was the year that everyone predicted would be a downer,''
said Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the federal Bureau
of Labor Statistics. ``But the city's economy did not go over the
cliff.''
   Paul Dickstein, director of the city's Office of Management and
Budget, agrees the crash did not bring on the economic disaster
predicted by some, but he said, ``We've paid for it ... and will
continue paying for it.''
   Dickstein cited the 6,000 jobs left vacant as a result of the
three-month hiring freeze and another 5,827 positions eliminated
under a subsequent reduction program aimed at saving $270 million.
   Officials were also forced to raise property taxes and to
eliminate an energy tax break for businesses. The object: to raise
$115 million to make up part of a projected $300 million in lost
tax and sales revenues.
   Though the city's economy remains ``basically healthy,''
Dickstein said, ``Things are going to be much tighter for the next
few years than it has been in some time.''
   ``We had been experiencing an unprecedented boom for a long
period of time'' because of the pre-crash bull market, Dickstein
said. ``We have to recognize that that's over and, therefore, city
expenditures have to be moderated.''
   ``After all, that was the most important industry in this
town,'' he said. ``Every town has one and ours was financial
services, and still is. You would expect then if your most
important industry is in the midst of shrinking _ jobs and revenue
_ that your tax revenues will decline with it.''
   For city residents, evidence of the crash of '87 will be seen in
the form of dirtier streets due to a smaller sanitation staff;
shorter library hours; more potholes; a police force whose ranks
are frozen.
   ``It's clear that New York City is in a very different
(economic) environment now,'' Ehrenhalt said. ``But on the whole,
if you consider the projections that had been made, this is a
relatively soft landing.''
   Ehrenhalt said one analyst predicted 70,000 jobs would be lost,
20,000 of them on Wall Street alone.
   In reality, unemployment in the city for the first half of 1988
was at a 19-year low of 4 percent, according to Ehrenhalt, and
there was a net decline of 12,000 jobs in the financial sector and
another 3,000 in banking.
   Those losses were offset by a gain of 16,000 jobs in the service
sector, which includes the legal profession, advertising, health
care and educational services.
   ``Normal growth for the city is about 1.8 percent to 2 percent.
So 1 percent after the crash is very good,'' said Rae Rosen, an
economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
   Predictions that other industries would feel tremors after the
crash didn't prove true, either.
   The hotel and restaurant industry emerged virtually unscathed,
thanks largely to the devalued U.S. dollar, which has made New York
``a bargain hunter's paradise'' for foreigners, Ehrenhalt said.
   The construction industry ``has held up well, though it's not as
strong as it was last year,'' Ehrenhalt said.
   And the real estate industry survived predictions that property
values would plunge as panicked executives unloaded condominiums
and suburban estates.
   ``I think most people held off looking (at properties) in the
first few months to see what would happen,'' said Steven Spinola,
head of the New York Real Estate Board. ``We've now got a healthier
residential market than before.''
   The Corcoran Group, which specializes in luxury residential
sales, reported that the average price of a two-bedroom apartment
in Manhattan rose 3.25 percent in August to $489,400.
   Spinola said office vacancy rates, up about 13 percent, are
``higher than we'd like'' but even that market remains relatively
strong.
   Thomas Purcell, executive director of the Stamford Board of
Realtors in Connecticut, said big-ticket estates, those in the
$900,000 to $2 million range, may have stayed on the market longer
than usual, but overall ``sales are equally as good as they've been
in other years.''
   Though some complained the real estate market was soft, Ms.
Rosen said it was ``only in the sense that people are no longer
getting 20 percent gains in prices each year ... The gains are
closer to 5 percent, which is a more normal market.''
   ``It's been a surprising year,'' said Ehrenhalt.

<HEAD>TNT, New Ted Turner Channel, To Showcase Films, Cartoons at First</HEAD>

   Ted Turner, who gave cable TV its first
superstation, launches his latest broadcasting venture Monday night
with the debut of Turner Network Television, the new home of
Scarlett O'Hara and Miss Piggy.
   At first, Turner will build TNT with films from his
billion-dollar film library, led off Monday by ``Gone With The
Wind,'' his favorite movie.
   On Tuesday, Muppet creator Jim Henson's popular ``Fraggle Rock''
show moves from Home Box Office to TNT. ``The Muppet Show,'' with
Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog, will follow that afternoon and
Henson has signed on for other projects.
   Although early on the 24-hour network will make liberal use of
cartoons in the daytime and movies at night, Turner promises one
major project a week by 1991: already scheduled are made-for-TNT
movies starring Martin Sheen and son Emilio Estevez, Farrah Fawcett
and Oscar-winners Charlton Heston and Faye Dunaway.
   Turner, owner of Cable News Network and CNN Headline News, also
promises to bid on major award shows, sporting events including the
Olympics and major league baseball, and other showcase programs.
   Turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get TNT
initially.
   ``It's far less important what they launch with than how quickly
they get into 30 million homes,'' said industry analyst Larry
Gerbrandt. ``I think they need to reach 30 million within ... 18 to
24 months to keep to their business plan, and actually they'd like
to do it sooner than that.''
   By reaching 30 million, Turner's contract with the National
Basketball Association will allow him to move a regular schedule of
pro basketball games _ featuring all the NBA teams, not just
Turner's own Atlanta Hawks _ from SuperStation TBS to TNT. That,
Turner said, will free him to show more Hawks games on TBS.
   TNT spokeswoman Allison Berry said early projections had TNT in
30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990, but the increase
in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989.
   Gerbrandt and other analysts suggest TNT is the next step in
cable programming.
   ``TNT creates a basis for cable to compete toe to toe down the
road with what the networks are going to do,'' said Scott Sassa,
the network's 29-year-old executive vice president.
   ``We've moved from cable providing a strong television signal to
becoming a provider of alternative programming, a variety of
programs,'' said Michael Kupinski, an industry analyst with A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   And TNT, which unlike movie channels allows local cable systems
to sell four minutes of advertising each hour, is ``great for the
cable industry itself,'' Kupinski said. ``Any addition in
programming is kind of a big benefit for cable, especially
exclusive programming.''
   The network promises it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for
the first three years into original programming, and Turner himself
told cable company executives in Atlanta for a trade show that the
network would lose $40 million before breaking even.
   ``That 80 percent is crucial,'' Gerbrandt said. Whereas many
cable networks are ``concept-driven _ all-news, all-sports _ this
is a real program-driven idea where it will succeed program by
program,'' he said.
   Sassa estimates it will take two years to lose that $40 million.
   But as Sassa and Turner point out, the start-up costs for TNT
would be greatly increased without Turner's purchase two years ago
of the film libraries.
   ``If we didn't have the MGM library, and the RKO and Warner
libraries, we never could have started the networks and that was a
billion and a half dollar investment,'' Turner said.
   Turner acquired more than 3,000 films when he purchased MGM@UA
Entertainment Co., then sold all but the films to pay for the
transaction.
   The deal left Turner saddled with $1.4 billion of debt, and
raised doubts about whether he could survive. That debt has since
been refinanced, and large cable companies have bought interest in
Turner Broadcasting System Inc., gaining seats on the board of
directors and say-so over large financial decisions.
   Gerbrandt said financial restrictions imposed on Turner by the
cable operators have contributed to the company's ability to
recover from the MGM deal.
   Turner executives also point to that cable participation as a
key to the company's survival, and as a guarantee to the industry
that TBS will remain a key provider of programming for their
systems.
   ``We're not going to take your money and head for Monte Carlo
with it, or take it and put it into a project for CBS, NBC or ABC
like some of the other interests whose ownership is more committed
to network television than it is to the cable industry,'' Turner
told the cable operators.
   Unlike the Fox Network, which broadcasts original programming on
weekend nights over the airwaves, TNT will be a 24-hour cable
operation.
   One of the keys to the success of TNT, according to Gerbrandt,
analyst for Kagan and Associates in Carmel, Calif., is the
acceptance by cable systems, whose limited channel space already is
overwhelmed.
   ``I think the general sense in the industry is that (TNT) is an
idea whose time has come, (but) he's launching it at a time when
channel capacity is not exactly abundant,'' Gerbrandt said in a
telephone interview.
   ``The real push is going to be in systems launching Jan. 1 and
mid-89,'' Gerbrandt said, because that's typically when cable
systems change services as they kick in rate increases.
   ``Also, ... if you're going to change your lineup, you do it at
that time.''
   A recent survey indicates the service has broad support among
some of the major system operators.
   Beaufort, N.C.-based Marquest Research said it interviewed key
executives at 15 companies ranking among the top 25 multiple system
cable operators, including eight of the top 10.
   It said two-thirds of those surveyed said TNT would be given
broad carriage across their systems, with the remaining third
saying carriage would be moderate.

<HEAD>Kennedy May Hold Decisive Vote as Supreme Court Opens New Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court begins its 1988-89 term
Monday with its newest justice, Anthony M. Kennedy, holding what
may be the decisive vote in major controversies over civil rights,
affirmative action, capital punishment and drug-testing.
   Many experts say Kennedy, beginning his first full term since
becoming a justice last February, could determine whether the
court's erratic 20-year drift toward conservatism will accelerate
dramatically.
   ``We're not sure where he lines up,'' said Thomas Krattenmaker,
dean of the Georgetown University Law School. ``It will be
interesting to see whether Kennedy takes the middle road or opts
for a more ideological route.''
   Over the next nine months, the court has agreed to rule on these
issues:
   _The death penalty for convicted murderers who committed their
crimes before reaching the age of 18.
   _The death penalty for mentally retarded killers.
   _The power of local governments to require that a certain
percentage of public works projects be awarded to minority-owned
construction businesses.
   _Mandatory drug testing for railroad employees involved in
serious accidents and for people seeking drug-enforcement jobs
within the U.S. Customs Service.
   _The continued vitality of a 1976 Supreme Court decision used to
fight private, or non-governmental, racial discrimination.
   The court could be deeply divided on each issue.
   An anticipated bellwether for Kennedy and the court is a North
Carolina case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment.
The justices, with Kennedy on the side of the majority, voted 5-4
last April to use the case to reconsider a 1976 decision called
Runyon vs. McCrary.
   In the 1976 decision, the court said racially segregated private
schools violate a federal civil rights law when they refuse to
admit black students. The ruling let civil rights groups use that
law as a weapon in attacking other forms of private bias as well.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun recently told a group of law students
in Arkansas, ``I think the outcome of the case will be of some
significance as to the movement of the court during the balance of
the 20th Century.''
   Marsha Levick, executive director of the National Organization
for Women's legal arm, said Kennedy's votes in the North Carolina
case and other pending civil rights disputes are key.
   ``Anthony Kennedy is absolutely someone to watch. He has not
been generous in his reading of civil rights laws'' as a federal
appeals court judge, she said.
   Blackmun, author of the high court's 1973 decision legalizing
abortion, told his Arkansas audience that Kennedy's views on the
issue _ as yet unknown _ could put the landmark Roe vs. Wade ruling
in jeopardy if a new abortion case wins the court's review.
   ``The next question is, `Will Roe vs. Wade go down the drain?' I
think there's a very distinct possibility it will _ this term,''
Blackmun said.
   Four court members _ Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor _
have criticized the 1973 decision.
   In an apparent reference to Kennedy, Blackmun added, ``One never
knows what a new justice's attitude is (toward overturning past
decisions).''
   Krattenmaker warned against judging Kennedy by his initial
votes, noting that in his early years on the court Blackmun was
considered a staunch conservative but is now viewed as a leading
liberal on many issues.
   ``We may not learn anything this term (about Kennedy) that turns
out to be enduring,'' Krattenmaker said.
   Noting that Blackmun soon will be 80 and that the court's two
leading liberals, Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall, are in their 80s, Krattenmaker said, ``We must look for
signs or signals that one or more of the justices is considering
retirement.''
   The court's conservatives are much younger. Rehnquist is 63,
White 71, Scalia 52, O'Connor 58, and Kennedy 52.
   The court's ninth member, Justice John Paul Stevens, is 68.
   Here, in summary form, are some of the cases the Supreme Court
is expected to decide this term:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEATH PENALTY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Should capital punishment be banned for all murderers not yet
18 when they committed their crime? The court came close to
deciding the issue last June but its deliberations in an Oklahoma
case yielded no clear majority position. Kennedy did not
participate in that case but will take part in deciding similar
cases from Georgia and Missouri this term.
   _Should mentally retarded killers be executed for their crimes?
The court is studying the case of a Texas murderer who has the
mental capacity of a 7-year-old.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May local governments require minority participation in public
works projects? The justices will resolve an attempt by Richmond,
Va., authorities to revive a so-called set-aside program that
required the prime contractor on any city building contract to
subcontract at least 30 percent of the project's value to firms
that are at least one-half minority owned.
   _May whites who claim they are the victims of ``reverse
discrimination'' challenge a court-approved plan between the
Birmingham, Ala., Fire Department and black firefighters to promote
more blacks?
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUG TESTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Is it an impermissible invasion of privacy rights to require
people seeking drug-enforcement jobs with the U.S. Customs Service
to undergo drug tests in which urine samples are taken?
   _May the nation's railroads require all employees involved in
serious accidents to undergo mandatory drug tests?
   Other drug-testing controversies, affecting many more people,
are waiting in the wings.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CRIMINAL LAW</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Is a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal
crimes valid? The validity of the U.S. Sentencing Commission that
fashioned those rules also is at issue _ and at stake are sentences
already meted out for tens of thousands of convicted criminals.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FREE SPEECH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May states use anti-racketeering laws to close down adult
bookstores accused of selling obscene materials even before those
materials are officially judged to be obscene? The court's ruling
in an Indiana case could affect anti-pornography efforts in other
states as well.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FAMILIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May states block a man from trying to prove he fathered the
child of a woman married to someone else? California, as do most
other states, gives a conclusive presumption of fatherhood to a
wife's husband and thus blocks others from claiming paternity.
   _May unwed fathers who actively seek custody of their children
be stripped of all parental rights if adoption is deemed to be in
the child's best interests? A case from California.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LIABILITY OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _May public officials be sued for their alleged negligence in
permitting a child to be abused by a parent? The Wisconsin case
gives the court an opportunity to study the phenomenon of holding
public officials accountable for their failure to take certain
actions.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SEXUAL BIAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _How difficult should it be for a woman to prove she was
illegally discriminated against because of her employer's
``unconscious stereotyping.'' The court will study the District of
Columbia case of a woman who says she was denied an accounting firm
partnership because her bosses believed she acted too aggressively
for a woman.

   Bullish American Petroleum Institute statistics
on domestic oil inventories have produced mixed results in the
futures market.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 3 cents
lower at $14.11 a barrel Wednesday after trading between $14.06 and
$14.27 during the day.
   Other contract months closed lower.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.58
cent to settle at 46.17 cents a gallon, while other contract months
closed mixed.
   October heating oil edged down 0.01 cent to 39.50 cents a
gallon, with other contract months declining.
   API statistics released after the close of trading Tuesday
showed that although gasoline inventories were up 2.2 million
barrels on a weekly basis to 219 million barrels, they 10 million
barrels below the same period a year earlier.
   Heating oil stocks were up 3 million barrels from a year
earlier, while crude oil was down 4 million barrels to 319 million
barrels, below the 337 million barrels of inventory last year,
according to API.
   Analysts said the lower crude statistics were considered
bullish, but the decline wasn't enough to offset concerns about the
oversupply of oil on world markets that has depressed prices
recently.
   Wednesday's gains, they said, stemmed from the combination of
lower gasoline stocks and API figures showing a drop in refinery
runs, down 550,000 barrels a day to 12.79 million barrels.
   ``When refinery runs go down then less gasoline will be coming
out,'' said Stephen Smith, research analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Brokers said some seasonal slowdown in refinery runs is expected
at the end of the summer, but the current drop was larger than
usual.

   Warner Communication Inc.'s $1.2 billion
acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures Corp. eventually will be
completed even though a state court has blocked the planned merger,
analysts predict.
   New York Supreme Court Justice Walter Schackman granted an
injunction against the deal Tuesday, ruling it violated a 1984 pact
between Warner and its biggest shareholder, Chris-Craft Industries
Inc., a broadcasting and manufacturing company.
   Warner says it will appeal the ruling.
   At issue are Lorimar's televison stations. Chris-Craft claimed
in a suit filed in July that because Lorimar owned six stations,
the merger violated a 4-year-old pact prohibiting Warner from
owning any TV station so long as it owned 25 percent or more of
Chris-Craft's BHC Inc. broadcasting subsidiary.
   Warner acquired a 42.5 percent stake in BHC in 1984 in exchange
for Chris-Craft getting 23 percent of Warner's voting stock.
   In his 13-page decision Tuesday, Schackman said Warner could not
acquire any Lorimar stock until the TV stations were sold or it
reduced its stake in BHC.
   Since the Chris-Craft suit was filed, Lorimar completed the sale
of network-affiliated television stations in Odessa, Texas;
Springfield, Mo.; and Redding, Calif., to a partnership that
includes a former Lorimar executive. It also reached an agreement
in principle to sell a fourth station in Pittsburgh, but two
independent stations in Puerto Rico remain on the auction block.
   Some analysts familiar with the case predicted the dispute would
be settled before the appeal process was concluded, because the
only remaining issue was the sale of the two Puerto Rico stations.
   ``The stations have been on the market for over a year and a
half and they've yet to see a buyer,'' said Christopher P. Dixon,
an analyst with the investment firm Kidder Peabody & Co. ``I expect
to find a buyer ... they (Lorimar) will have to consider bids that
they were not willing to consider before.
   ``I expect the Lorimar deal to close, but obviously the time
frame has become extended.''
   The Warner-Lorimar deal was reached last spring. Warner said it
would pay $630 million in cash and stock for all the outstanding
shares of Lorimar and assume $550 million in debt, giving the deal
a total value of $1.18 billion.
   Lorimar, based in Culver City, Calif., produces several hit TV
shows, including ``Dallas,'' ``Knots Landing'' and ``Alf.'' It also
has a strong lineup of syndicated shows sold directly to individual
television stations.
   New York-based Warner's interests include movies, cable
television and magazine publishing.
   Warner stock rose 50 cents a share to $36 New York Stock
Exchange trading. Lorimar fell $1.50 a share to $12.50 on the
American Stock Exchange.

   Warner spokesman Geoffrey Holmes said the company actively is
looking for buyers for the Puerto Rican stations and would not sell
any shares of BHC. The company had maintained in court filings that
it would be hurt financially if it was forced to sell its BHC stake
at ``fire sale'' prices.
   Warner contends the proposed merger would not violate the
agreement with Chris-Craft because Warner planned to set up an
independent trust, pending approval from the Federal Communications
Commission, to run the remaining Lorimar TV stations.
   The Warner-Lorimar deal also needs approval from Lorimar
shareholders. A special meeting was scheduled for Oct. 3, although
a Lorimar spokeswoman declined to say whether Tuesday's court
decision would force a postponement.

<HEAD>Interest Rate Rise Seen as Threat to Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance officials from 151 countries, wrapping up
the annual World Bank-International Monetary Fund meeting today,
heard some grim warnings about the threat of high interest rates on
the Third World, which already is reeling under a $1.2 trillion
debt.
   Industrialized nations see higher interest rates as a way to
curb inflation, and in the United States, to attract money from
abroad to finance the federal budget deficit.
   But higher rates also mean higher debt payments for Third World
countries.
   ``Every rise of one percentage point in interest rates costs the
debtors another $6 billion a year,'' said Stanley Fischer, vice
president and chief economist of the World Bank.
   Developing nations already pay more than $50 billion a year on
loans subject to variable interest rates, and complain that too
large a share of their earnings go to pay interest, leaving little
to improve living standards.
   In many of debtors, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, incomes
have been declining for 20 years.
   ``It would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for
inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises,''
said Giuliano Amato, Italy's treasury minister.
   The World Bank is the chief source of aid for Third World
countries, lending about $17 billion annually.
   The IMF, which lends about $8 billion a year, originally was
concerned with keeping currency rates stable. Now both bodies
devote most of their efforts to helping arrange new loans for Third
World countries, in the hope that the money will be more wisely
invested and help debtors ``grow out'' of their troubles.
   Delegates to the meetings from rich and poor countries have been
searching for new ways to lighten the debt burden.
   Attention has concentrated on a proposal from Japan outlined
Tuesday by Satoshi Sumita, governor of the Bank of Japan. It would
turn some of the debt into bonds and sell them to the public,
delaying repayment by many years.
   The bonds would be backed by money paid into special accounts,
managed by the IMF. Repayment of the rest of the debt would be
stretched out.
   But many said Sumita's speech left many questions about the plan
unanswered, such as the advantages to the debtors or whether the
plan shift the risk for the original loans from creditor banks to
the banks' governments and their taxpayers.
   Another issue arising at the meeting was the future of the IMF's
monetary unit _ the ``special drawing right'' or SDR.
   The fund first issued SDRs in 1972 with the hope they eventually
would replace gold, the dollar and other currencies as the world's
major reserve asset. It was thought the international monetary
system could then be better managed, and no longer would depend so
much on gold mining in South Africa and the Soviet Union and on
U.S. domestic policy about the dollar.
   About $27 billion worth of SDRs have been issued, the last batch
in 1981, and the Reagan administration has resisted any further
issue. SDRs, now worth about $1.29 each, are traded only among
governments and some specially authorized banks.
   Sumita suggested expanding use of the SDR, and perhaps extending
it to private business. There should be more reserve currencies
``to complement the dollar's key role,'' he said. He also said
Japan was removing barriers to the use of the yen as an
international currency.
   Nicholas F. Brady, the new U.S. secretary of the Treasury, did
not comment publicly. Any discussion of reducing the international
role of the dollar could be politically explosive in a U.S.
election year.
   Others at the meeting have been skeptical about any bigger role
for the SDR, including West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg and Nigel Lawson, the British chancellor of the
exchequer.
   Lawson said nothing had come of the persistent effort to replace
the dollar with the SDR, and he believed it was unlikely anything
would.
   Stoltenberg said: ``We shouldn't attach too high expectations to
this.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Icahn Challenge To Texaco Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may be time for takeover strategist
Carl Icahn and others involved in Texaco Inc.'s landmark bankruptcy
reorganization to ``take their marbles and go home,'' according to
the judge who dismissed Icahn's challenge to the restructuring.
   U.S. District Judge Gerard Goettel ruled Wednesday that the
Icahn Group's appeal of two key parts of the plan was moot because
the group did not move fast enough to block confirmation of
Texaco's $5.6 billion reorganization.
   Icahn, who is Texaco's largest shareholder, has sought to gain
representation on the oil giant's board of directors and otherwise
raise takeover pressure on the company in order to boost its stock
price.
   ``Whatever future designs the Icahn Group may harbor for Texaco,
fallout from the Texaco-Getty merger has been littering the
economic landscape for the past four years,'' wrote Goettel.
   The judge advised the parties to ``take their marbles and go
home, closing out one of the most bizarre chapters of American
legal and economic history.''
   Neither Icahn nor Texaco had any immediate comment on the ruling.
   Texaco's 1984 acquisition of Getty Oil Co. spawned a lawsuit by
rival Pennzoil Co., which claimed Texaco wrongly interfered with
its takeover of Getty.
   In 1985, a Texas jury awarded Pennzoil $10.3 billion in damages,
an award upheld throughout the Texas state courts.
   To avoid having to post a bond equivalent to the award in order
to appeal the judgment, Texaco sought protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law in April 1987.
   When Texaco announced a $3 billion settlement with Pennzoil as
part of the reorganization plan, Icahn _ who controls 14.9 percent
of Texaco's outstanding shares _ announced his opposition to two
aspects of the plan.
   Icahn opposed a provision releasing Texaco's officers from
pesonal liability resulting from the merger and attendant lawsuit.
   Icahn also objected to a provision in a financing clause that
said any change of control in the company's management would
constitute default on a bank loan.
   While objecting to the two provisions, Icahn nonetheless voted
for the plan and never sought a stay of the shareholder vote or of
its implementation.
   The plan was approved by Texaco shareholders and the comapny
emerged from Chapter 11 in April.
   Icahn later lost a proxy fight aimed at gaining control of five
seats on the Texaco board.
   In addition to the settlement with Pennzoil, Texaco's
reorganization included the sale of 50 percent of its refining and
marketing operations in 23 states to Saudi Arabia, the sale of its
West German operations to Rheinish-Westfaelisches
Elektrizitaetswerk AG and the proposed sale of its 78 percent stake
in Texaco Canada Inc.

<HEAD>Japan Investors Show Growing Interest in U.S. Film Market</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investors, who have displayed a
multibillion-dollar appetite for U.S. real estate, are showing
growing interest in the American film market.
   ``I continue to see a lot of investment dollars coming into the
U.S.,'' Christopher Murray, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes
in various facets of the film industry, told industry executives on
Wednesday. ``The emerging trend is very beneficial for Hollywood
and the film industry.
   ``Wall Street's appetite is declining,'' Murray said of the
constant problem of film financing. ``My belief and hope is that
the Japanese will fill that gap.''
   The comments were part of a panel discussion, ``The
Japan-Hollywood Connection,'' at the CINETEX film festival and
trade exhibition. The show, which closes Friday, has drawn film
industry leaders to this entertainment capital.
   Yasuyoshi Tokuma, chairman of Los Angeles-based Tokuma Group,
said the Japanese know ``that to be international, they have to
come to Hollywood.''
   Tokuma said the Japanese are interested in backing ``any type of
films that communicate,'' regardless of whether they are Far
East-oriented.
   Tokuma said his company just finished a $35 million production
titled ``Tonko.'' He said the company pre-sold 4.2 million tickets
to the production in Japan, thus assuring it will make a profit.
   Kenji Kitatani, a New York-based consultant, said there is
``much money in Japan for the U.S.,'' coupled with a growing
interest in the film industry.
   Murray said in dealing with the Japanese, the relationship was
``between parties rather than points of a deal.'' He said the
Japanese favored short, simple agreements and view the United
States as ``over-lawyered.''
   CINETEX opened Saturday, with industry leaders discussing a
variety of topics that included film financing to the future of the
home video market.

<HEAD>Twentieth Birthday Of 747s To Be Marked By Seattle Flyby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first and latest versions of the Boeing 747
will fly side-by-side over Seattle on Friday to mark the 20th
birthday of the world's largest commercial jet.
   The Boeing 747s, each with the trademark hump on top of its
cockpit and front cabin, will fly over Elliott Bay and Mount
Rainier, weather permitting, to give Seattle residents another look
at the region's most famous product.
   ``Of all our planes, the 747's the most recognized worldwide,''
said David Jimenez, a Boeing spokesman.
   Since the first flight in 1969, the 12 different versions of
Boeing 747s produced in Everett have flown almost 850 million
passengers and about 12 billion miles worldwide.
   Boeing has received orders for 875 of the 747s since Pan
American World Airways ordered the first 25 in 1966.
   Industry analysts say the 747, with a price tag of about $125
million a plane, up from about $20 million for the originals,
brings the most cash to Boeing.
   On the surface, the earliest 747 and the brand new 747-400 model
making Friday's flyby look much the same. But company officials say
the two planes have more differences than similarities.
   The original 747 had a maximum takeoff weight of 710,000 pounds
and could carry 385 passengers about 4,000 nautical miles. The
747-400 has a maximum takeoff weight of 870,000 pounds and can
carry 412 passengers 7,300 nautical miles.
   Boeing expects the first 747-400 to be certified by the Federal
Aviation Administration by year-end and then sold to Northwest
Airlines.
   Boeing officials say they are confident the 747 will retain a
strong position worldwide, despite competition from McDonnell
Douglas' MD-11 in 1990 and from Airbus Industrie's A340.
   ``There's still a huge potential because of passenger growth and
for replacing older planes,'' said Phil Condit, executive vice
president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
   ``The 5 percent predicted growth in air traffic is a lot of
people, and as airports get more congested, airlines will want the
large 747s,'' Condit said.
   The 747-400 won't be the end of the line of 747s. Boeing
designers are considering shortening the jumbo jet to make it more
efficient, or stretching it to accomodate another 150 passengers.
   Malcolm Stamper, the Boeing vice chairman who oversaw the
building of the first 747, said Boeing's success comes from meeting
market demand.
   For example, the Boeing 747 design evolved when the company was
considering enlarging its popular 707. The 747 was conceived in
1965 because air-traffic growth required a larger, all-new plane,
said Joe Sutter, chief designer of the 747, who is now retired but
works as a consultant for Boeing.
   At the same time, Boeing was designing a supersonic transport,
and most industry officials thought the 747 would be used mainly as
a cargo plane and most passengers would choose the faster SST.
   The hump at the front of the 747 originally was intended to
facilitate loading large cargo containers.
   But when government funding for the SST was canceled, the 747
became the dominant long-haul carrier.

   The World Bank will increase its yearly loans
nearly 50 percent by 1992 to help end poverty in the Third World,
the organization's president said today.
   Barber B. Conable spoke in West Berlin during the annual meeting
of the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary
Fund. Participants from 151 nations have spent a week exploring
ways to lighten the debt load of poor nations. The meeting ends
today.
   Leftist groups have mounted protests to criticize the
international banks, which make development loans, for insisting on
repayment by Third World nations.
   About 1,000 demonstrators gathered at a church nearby Wednesday
and chanted ``IMF Murder Meeting.'' Thousands of riot police held
them back with plastic shields.
   Third World countries owe about $1.2 trillion to international
and private lenders as well as governments.
   Conable predicted that the World Bank will be lending $25
billion dollars a year by 1992 to Third World nations. It now lends
about $17 billion a year, and the monetary fund provides about $8
million more.
   Speaking at a news conference, he said $5 billion will go to the
poorest countries, which are mainly in Africa.
   Conable said the bank will strengthen its aid by sharing more
financing with other donors. He said Japanese officials have told
him they plan to help and promised to talk with him about a program.
   Contributions to the bank come from the 151 member governments.
   Conable also pinpointed trade imbalances as part of the debt
problem faced by poor countries. He said they cause losses twice as
great as the aid such countries receive from wealthier nations.
   Speakers from the Third World have protested repeatedly at the
meeting that the industrial countries put up barriers to their
exports that prevent debtor countries from earning money.
   In an interview before his news conference, Conable said he
believed interest rates were stabilizing after recent increases.
   The financial leaders have listened this week to warnings that
higher interest rates, used by the United States and other
industrial countries to cool inflation, threaten the Third World.
   ``It would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for
inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises,''
said Giuliano Amato, Italy's treasury minister.
   At Wednesday's sessions, participants seeking new ways to ease
the burden of debt heard about the cost of higher interest rates to
Third World countries.
   Every 1 percent rise in interest rates costs the debtors $6
billion more a year, said Stanley Fischer, vice president and chief
economist of the World Bank.
   The United States and other industrial countries view higher
interest as a way of controlling price increases. In the United
States, higher interest rates also attract money from abroad to
meet the federal budget deficit.
   Third World countries pay more than $50 billion a year on loans
subject to variable interest rates.
   They complain that too much of their earnings go to pay
interest, leaving little to improve living standards. In many of
them, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, people's incomes have been
declining for 20 years.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge, citing a conflict of
interest, has disqualified a law firm from representing a $2.5
billion trust fund set up to compensate women injured by the Dalkon
Shield intrauterine device.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan of Alexandria, Va., ruled
Wednesday that Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft couldn't represent the
trustees because it had advised claimants in the bankruptcy-law
proceedings of A.H. Robins Co., a health-products firm that
produced the Dalkon Shield.
   A flood of personal injury lawsuits stemming from Dalkon Shield
injuries had forced Robins to file for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws three years
ago.
   Bryan's ruling clears a major obstacle to the trust beginning to
make payments to nearly 200,000 women with pending claims. American
Home Products Corp., a New York health products company, has agreed
to acquire Richmond-based Robins and provide most of the money for
the $2.5 billion trust.
   John J. Walsh, a partner at Cadwalder, said the company was
considering an appeal. ``We respectfully disagree with the court's
analysis,'' he told the New York Times.

<HEAD>Strike-Triggering Austerity Program To Be Amended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unpopular emergency economic
program, which has triggered a wave of strikes in Yugoslavia
because it allowed price hikes while limiting wages, will be
amended next week, newspapers reported Thursday.
   Changes in the program, that will include wage increases for
workers of those companies which are making profits, are scheduled
to be adopted in Yugoslavia's parliament on Oct. 3, the Borba
newspaper said.
   There have been numerous protest marches in Yugoslavia by
workers publicly airing their grievances after the government
introduced the austerity program last May, allowing substantial
price hikes and hefty wage cuts.
   The program lifted price controls for about 60 percent of goods
and services which had been under a price freeze since November
last year.
   The unpopular measures contributed to a further decline of
living standards, which have fallen by more than one-third since
1980. Labor unrest also increased.
   Yugoslav officials have repeatedly claimed that there is no
alternative to the market-oriented program, worked out together
with the International Monetary Fund, if the country wants to lower
its 200 percent inflation and repay its $21 billion foreign debt.
   Borba quoted Yugoslav officials as saying that negotiations are
in progress with the IMF in order to get the Fund's approval for
changing wage increase restrictions now in the economic program.
   The adoption of the program was a precondition set by the IMF
and other creditors for rescheduling of Yugoslavia's foreign debt
and obtaining new credits.
   During the first nine months of this year, salaries in
Yugoslavia have dropped by 10 percent in real terms compared with
the same period last year, and have reached the level of early
1970s, newspapers reported.
   Meanwhile, Belgrade shoppers were hit Thursday by a fresh wave
of price hikes, ranging from 300 to over 1,000 percent, the
Politika Ekspres daily reported.
   Of about 600 products, including food, drinks and cosmetics
whose prices went up in Belgrade shops Thursday, the highest
increase was recorded by a brand cheese _ 1,221 percent, said the
newspaper.

   The European Economic Community on

   Willy De Clercq, the EEC's External Relations Commissioner, said
the ``commission can only be satisfied with the decision by
President Reagan'' and urged the U.S. Congress not to override the
veto.
   ``This bill is very unsettling for international commerce and,
if it were adopted by Congress, would provoke grave consequences
for the trade in textiles,'' he said in a statement.
   He said enacting the bill also would endanger the success of
international trade talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs

<HEAD>Angry Investors Demonstrate; Call For Stock Market Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 800 investors angered by plunging
share prices demonstrated outside the Finance Ministry Thursday to
demand the government postpone or withdraw its plan to reimpose a
stock profit tax.
   The investors, shouting ``Step Down (Finance Minister) Shirley
Kuo!'' were prevented by police from entering the ministry building.
   Some protesters called for closure of the stock market while the
government works out a more acceptable tax plan with investors.
   Earlier Thursday, stock brokerage firms were flooded with
selling orders that found few buyers when the market re-opened
after a four-day holiday for the mid-autumn festival.
   The stock index fell 175.96 points to close at 8,613.62 points
on what many traders called ``Black Thursday.''
   Of the 151 shares listed on the market, 114 posted the maximum 3
percent daily loss allowed by the government. Three shares recorded
gains and there was no transaction on the others.
   Turnover totaled 280 million Taiwan dollars ($9.6 million) down
from Saturday's 47.5 billion Taiwan dollars ($1.6 billion).
   On Saturday, the Finance Ministry said the government next year
would reimpose a tax on stock profits. The plan calls for investors
who sell stocks worth more than 3 million Taiwan dollars ($103,400)
in one year to include their stock income when filing their annual
personal income tax.
   Many protesters said they wanted the government to scrap the
tax, but others demanded lower tax rates or postponing
implementation of the tax plan by one year.
   ``We were caught up,'' said an investor, who identified herself
only as Ms. Wu. ``The government should not have waited till now to
announce the severe tax. It should have done this half a year ago
before prices soared up like this.''
   She said she purchased 10 million Taiwan dollars (about
$350,000) in stocks Saturday when the market index hit a record
high of 8,789.78 points, a 275 percent increase from last December.
   Lee Ching-tu, one of 10 protesters later allowed in the ministry
to state their cases, said the market should be closed temporarily
to prevent investors from ``dumping their shares amid
uncertainties.''
   The protesters were received by Finance Ministry official Wang
Cheng-yi, who agreed to pass their opinions to the authorities.
   Market analysts expect stock prices to continue to drop for
another two weeks before stabilizing. The government, they said,
imposed the tax to control rampant stock speculation that could
have resulted in severe losses for investors if the market had
crashed.
   Taiwan's stock market has been manipulated by major players
including underground investment firms that attract deposits by
offering as much as 4 percent monthly interest. Analysts say a
market crash could have forced those companies to close and result
in losses to numerous investors.
   John Chien, president of Federated International Securities
Consulting Company, said the tax measure ``was too drastic and came
too late.''
   Kuo said Tuesday the stock tax would not trigger a market crash
because Taiwan has a robust economy that can sustain a market
growth.
   Taiwan's economy grew 11 percent last year and is expected to
grow 7.3 percent this year.
   The stock income tax was lifted in 1976 when Taiwan's economy
slowed because of the world oil crisis.
   The Finance Ministry said investors who hold their purchased
shares for a year or more would have half of their shares waived
from taxes to encourage long-term investments.
   Workers who earn more than 3.5 million Taiwan dollars
   ($121,000) a year pay the top personal income tax of 50 percent.

   Investors led by two former Koppers Co.
executives and a Washington, D.C., banker said they purchased
Koppers' coatings business.
   No purchase price was given when the deal was announced
Wednesday.
   The business will be known as Kop-Coat Inc.
   Burnett G. Bartley Jr., formerly executive vice president of
Koppers, will serve as chairman and chief executive of Kop-Coat.
The new company's president and chief operating officer is Charles
G. Pauli, formerly vice president and general manager of Koppers'
coatings unit.
   They teamed with Washington banker John J. Mason to acquire
Kop-Coat with financing arranged by Pittsburgh National Bank.
   During British industrialist Brian Beazer's successful takeover
battle for Koppers earlier this year, the Pittsburgh construction
materials and chemicals company filed court documents listing
profits from the coating business as $1.7 million on sales of $45
million.
   Kop-Coat has six plants nationwide that make protective coatings
for industrial, marine, residential and commercial uses. The best
known is its line of Wolman coatings.

   Societe Generale de Belgique SA said
Thursday it is ready to continue talks with Robert Maxwell that
could result in the British publisher gaining a stake in Belgium's
largest holding company.
   Maxwell and Societe Generale agreed in June to cooperate in
creating a joint venture in communications, and the two sides had
broached the possibility of Maxwell acquiring shares in Societe
Generale.
   But the negotiations were interrupted when Maxwell turned his
attention to Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publishing and
information services company he has offered to acquire for $2.47
billion in cash. This week Macmillan agreed to a $2.5 billion
cash-and-securities buyout by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co., but Maxwell said he was mulling his options.
   On Wednesday, Maxwell said he remained interested in acquiring a
stake in Societe Generale and that talks may resume soon.
   A spokesman for Societe Generale said, ``We continue to be
interested in having more international shareholders.''
   Maxwell appears primarily drawn to Societe Generale's media
interests, which are concentrated in Tractebel SA.

<HEAD>Industry Leaders Think Congress Can Override Textile Bill Veto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apparel industry leaders were undaunted after
President Reagan's veto of the textile imports bill, predicting
election-year politics would help supporters of the measure swing
enough votes for a congressional override.
   ``Politically, these are very hot times,'' predicted Howard
Cooley, president of Jockey International and president of the
American Apparel Manufacturers Association, which is holding its
annual meeting during a trade show in Atlanta this week.
   ``There will be an override effort,'' he said. ``We suspect that
there will be some votes changing,'' he said.
   The bill would limit import growth for apparel and textile
products to 1 percent a year beginning in January, freeze imports
of non-rubber footwear and impose quotas on 180 categories of
textile products and 30 types of footwear.
   The bill passed the Senate 59-36, four votes short of the needed
two-thirds to override; the House approved the bill 248-150, 17
votes shy.
   The battle to override will be close, ``but it's winnable,''
said Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., a supporter of the bill, which
President Reagan vetoed Wednesday.
   The main purpose of the legislation, Jenkins said, is to apply
pressure on Reagan to enforce existing textile import restrictions.
   ``Even if we do not override, we try to keep the pressure on the
president to make sure he enforces the existing agreements,''
Jenkins said.
   American Textile Manufacturers Institute President Daniel K.
Frierson, chairman of Dixie Yarns Inc., said, ``The veto shows a
callous disregard for millions of workers who jobs are being wiped
out by imports.
   ``We believe that the celebration by foreign interests and
giant, money-grubbing importers will be brief because Congress will
override the veto,'' Frierson said in a statement released in
Washington.
   Cooley said the import bill would have brought order to national
trade policy, which he said penalizes apparel and textile
manufacturers.
   ``We are the most labor-intensive industry and therefore are
much more subject to (competition from) the lesser developed
countries,'' Cooley told reporters during a news conference.
   Also predicting an override was Joseph M. Edalin, vice chairman
of underwear manufacturer Fruit of the Loom Inc.
   The bill was supported by both management and labor with
conservative Southern lawmakers, who represent textile-producing
areas, working with such labor unions as the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile
Workers Union.
   ``I'm very disappointed, but not totally surprised at Reagan's
decision,'' said James K. Tribble, a regional ACTWU director from
Chicago who was in Atlanta for the show.
   He predicted an override effort stood ``a fair-to-middlin'
chance of success.''
   Tribble also blamed imports for contributing to recent shakeups
in the industry which have seen some of the largest manufacturers
broken up or taken over in leveraged buyouts.
   Not all apparel executives support the bill.
   One opposed was Erle Norton, vice president of Atlanta-based
Oxford Industries Inc., one of the nation's 10 largest apparel
manufacturers.
   He said the measure would hurt companies such as his which use
some imported fabrics, or are involved in operations whereby cut
material is sent overseas for sewing, and then brought back into
the United States at reduced tariffs.
   ``Sometimes the cure can be worse than the disease,'' said David
Slossberg, vice president and general manager of Caleb V. Smith &
Son Inc., a Galion, Ohio, uniform manufacturer.
   ``If we get into a protectionist profile, somewhere else down
the line, somebody's going to get hurt,'' Slossberg said.

<HEAD>Company Rolls Along On Popularity of In-Line Skate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the delight of two Minnesota
companies, exercise enthusiasts around the country are rollicking
on a new set of wheels that look like ice skates and ride like
roller skates.
   ``We're going after people who want to have some serious fun and
want to make the investment in the product,'' said John Sundet,
president of Eden Prairie-based Rollerblade Inc.
   Sundet would not disclose financial information about the
privately held company, but said Rollerblade has 75 percent of the
$10 million to $12 million market for the skates. Rollerblade's top
competitor is Blaine, Minn.-based First Team Sports, which sells
its version of the in-line skate under the brand name of
Ultra-Wheels.
   ``It's a healthy competition,'' said John Egart, vice president
of marketing for First Team Sports. He said First Team has about 20
percent to 25 percent of what he estimates is an $8 million to $10
million market.
   ``It's very similar to roller skating, but it has the feel of
ice skates,'' said skater Gary Baglien, who stopped for a breather
during a recent spin around Minneapolis' Lake Calhoun. ``There's
definitely more speed than the conventional skates.''
   Baglien, who skates every other day to stay in shape, said using
the in-line skate is ``a little more tricky'' than the conventional
skate, particularly when it comes to stopping.
   The ``in-line'' skate looks like a hockey skate mounted on a
line of three or four wheels. A rubber brake pad is located on the
back of the right skate as opposed to the front bumpers on many
roller skates.
   Its popularity began among hockey players and cross-country
skiers looking for a way to stay in shape during the off-season,
but has recently spread to others looking for an alternative
outdoor exercise.
   The company's biggest markets used to be in ice-skating
strongholds such as Boston and Minneapolis, but now the hottest
sales are in southern California, where they're popular in places
such as Venice Beach. New York's Central Park is another popular
spot for single-track skaters.
   ``It's not a toy, not a frivolous type item. It's to an extent a
recreational product,'' said Sundet. ``Fitness is the key,
particularly with all the concern about health lately.''
   A Rollerblade study claims to show that users of the skates
improved aerobic endurance and reduced body fat. Sundet said
skating with in-line skates is a great alternative to jogging
because there is less pounding on the joints.
   The skates, which sell for between $89.95 and $175, are
assembled at the company's Eden Prairie headquarters, then shipped
across the country and overseas. Most of the parts are made
overseas.
   ``We've barely tapped the market nationally. It has an enormous
potential to become a nationally recognized product,'' said Sundet,
who expects strong Christmas sales.
   Egart said First Team Sports is not particulalry troubled that
``rollerblade'' has become synonymous with in-line skates. ``We're
doing our best to make people aware that there are other
manufacturers out there other than Rollerblade,'' he said.
   Two years ago, Rollerblade had two models of in-line skates;
This fall, they have nine. The original model was black, similar to
hockey skates, but Rollerblade is now using brightly-colored boots
and wheels.
   Rollerblade is taking measures to ensure the skates will not
become just another fad. The company is supporting an in-line skate
federation, creating competitive events and is considering
expanding into a line of accessories and clothing.
   ``I'm very optimistic that this is not a fad,'' said Sundet, who
at age 40 is the company's oldest employee. ``We really do think
there is a long-term market for this product.''
   The company's sales in July were four times what they were last
year, and Sundet said they plan to stay on top of the market. The
company's marketing strategy includes skating demonstrations from
seven vans that travel around the country.
   Rollerblade received a publicity boost last winter when Chicago
Bears Coach Mike Ditka called the Metrodome the ``Rollerdome.''
Minnesota Vikings General Manager Mike Lynn countered by sending
Ditka a pair of Rollerblades and Lynn also outfitted the Vikings'
cheerleaders with them to wear during the Dec. 6 Vikings-Bears
matchup.
   The company got its start nine years ago when Scott and Brennan
Olson, both high school hockey players, were looking for a way to
condition in the summertime.
   The brothers purchased a pair of what Brennan described as
``crude, slow'' in-line skates on sale for $15 at a sporting goods
store, and set out to create a better skate.
   Six months later, they were selling them out of their parents'
basement in Bloomington, Minn. Scott Olson later sold the company
while Brennan stayed on and is now Rollerblade's director of
research and development.
   ``We are constantly improving the product and coming up new ones
that are more appealing to a wider variety,'' Brennan Scott said.
   While the in-line skate seems like the latest innovation in the
skating world, the concept dates back to the early 1700s when a
Dutchman nailed wooden spools to strips of wood and attached them
to his shoes.

   Here are brief sketches of key studies into the October 1987
stock market collapse:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Presidential Task Force</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   This panel, appointed by President Reagan and headed by
now-Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, recommended that a supreme
regulatory authority such as the Federal Reserve oversee the
markets now governed by separate agencies.
   It also recommended adoption of ``circuit breakers,'' such as
price limits and trading halts, across all inter-related markets.
In addition, it suggested higher margin or down-payment
requirements for speculative trading in futures, and expedited
settlement procedures for stock trading.
   Furthermore, the panel said computerized trading tactics, which
a handful of large investors used to dump massive amounts of
stocks, contributed to the speed and intensity of the collapse.

<BYLINE>White House Working Group on Financial Markets</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   This panel, headed by the Undersecretary for Finance George D.
Gould, evaluated the conclusions of the Brady group, which weren't
well received in the administration partly because they advocated
more regulation. The Gould panel, composed of senior aides in the
Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange
Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission, rejected the
idea of a single regulatory authority.
   It further rejected suggestions that the SEC should regulate
stock-index futures trading, which is regulated by the CFTC,
although the panel endorsed raising margin requirements in futures.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>General Accounting Office</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   The investigative arm of Congress concluded that computerized
trading and the regulation of transactions should be overhauled to
avoid another crash.
   Since the nation's financial markets are increasingly
intertwined, federal agencies and market officials must monitor the
entire system, not just individual stock exchanges, and trading
officials must find ways to prevent plummeting prices in one
exchange from spilling into others, the GAO said. The GAO agreed
with the Brady panel that government should more effectively
supervise the markets, but it didn't endorse the idea of
designating the Federal Reserve for that job. It took no position
on ``circuit breakers.''
   The GAO is conducting a separate study, still in the early
stages, that will examine the evolution of clearance and settlement
procedures for securities and questions surrounding investor
protection.

<BYLINE>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   The federal agency that oversees Chicago commodities markets,
where stock-index futures and options are traded, said it could
find no evidence that computerized trading strategies caused or
aggravated the market break.
   The commission blamed what it called ``unprecedented change'' in
investor psychology, and suggested the crash was the culmination of
a drop in stock prices that had begun months earlier.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Securities and Exchange Commission</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   The federal agency that oversees stock and bond markets said
computerized trading techniques did not cause the market plunge by
themselves, but ``had an indirect negative effect.'' The SEC said
``changes in investor perception, institutional stock selling and
program trading strategies combined to accelerate the market's
downward slide.''
   The agency opposed limits on price movements and did not call
for a new regulatory authority to oversee all financial markets, as
the Brady panel did. But the SEC suggested increased curbs on
stock-index futures.

<BYLINE>North American Securities Administrators Association</BYLINE>

   This group of state securities industry regulators concluded the
crash revealed widespread shoddy sales practices by brokers. It
urged tighter margin restrictions and disclosure requirements. The
group's study, the first to come out after the October break, was
based on complaints from investors.

   The nation's biggest stock market largely blamed the crash on
the Chicago futures markets, calling them a haven for speculators.
The report recommended tighter restrictions on futures markets,
including higher margin requirements.
   The NYSE further recommended that the SEC regulate all financial
instruments, including stock-index futures.
   Despite external criticism that the NYSE specialists who make
markets in individual stocks failed to keep the market orderly
during the crash, the exchange said the specialists generally
performed well under crisis conditions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   The nation's largest futures market blamed the crash on waves of
selling that struck Wall Street and reverberated everywhere. It
said stock-index futures trading played no role in the crash.
Furthermore it found no need for changing the futures-trading
system. A study by the Chicago Board Options Exchange reached
similar conclusions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>National Association of Securities Dealers</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   
   The group that monitors the nationwide computerized network of
over-the-counter trading did not study the causes of the crash but
said it ``clearly revealed vulnerabilities and deficiencies in all
markets.''
   The NASD undertook an extensive review of trading procedures and
tightened the rules for market makers in over-the-counter issues.
It endorsed stricter rules for selling borrowed stocks, known as
short sales, though the NASD said there was no evidence
short-selling was a problem during the crash.
   The NASD rejected the Brady panel's proposal for marketwide
``circuit breakers.'' But it endorsed the idea of a congressionally
supported study of the growth in new trading strategies and their
impact.

<HEAD>Crash Study Recommendations Still Debated; Few Implemented</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the year since Black Monday, government and
securities industry groups have undertaken at least a dozen major
studies into causes of the crash and possible safeguards to prevent
another disaster.
   But the proposed remedies are largely technical, some are
contradictory, few have been implemented, none has been written
into law and chances seem increasingly remote that any will be in
the foreseeable future.
   Moreover, critics contend, most studies have failed to confront
important underlying problems and weaknesses in the nation's
securities markets, such as why stocks shot up so far in the first
place before crashing.
   These critics say the recommendations made to date appear
designed mainly to protect powerful interests that control the
industry, such as the specialists who make markets for stocks on
the New York Stock Exchange, and the floor traders on the Chicago
futures and options exchanges.
   Some say key issues, such as speculative abuses, the function of
market makers and Wall Street's changing role in the economy,
remain unresolved or ignored.
   ``The financial events of October 1987 will probably be
remembered by our descendants as vividly as we remember the events
of October 1929,'' Junius W. Peake, a capital-markets consultant
and expert who has studied the crash, wrote in a recent edition of
Investment Management Review.
   ``What will ultimately matter most, however, is whether the
forensic economists and writers who issue the final autopsy report
will make a correct diagnosis of the near cause of death of the
U.S. equity market.''
   So far, the Black Monday inquests have caused little more than
disputes and bickering. Even the Reagan administration couldn't
agree on the conclusions of its own crash study headed by
now-Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, and convened a second panel
that largely refuted the Brady group's recommendations. The
Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading
Commission, which regulate market practices, couldn't agree on who
should supervise stock-index futures, an exotic product that some
studies linked to the wild price swings during the crash.
   The Federal Reserve, which Brady's group had suggested as the
super-regulator of all markets, appears highly unwilling to assume
that role.
   The New York Stock Exchange, a powerful bastion of market
makers, concluded that speculative selling in the Chicago futures
pits played a crucial role in the rout.
   No, the Chicago exchanges retorted, it was panic selling in New
York that started the crash, plus the failure or unwillingness of
the NYSE specialists to handle the flood of sell orders.
   Meanwhile, an emotional debate has raged about the role of
computerized program trading strategies that exploit price
differences between stocks and stock-index futures, sometimes
causing sudden price jolts.
   Critics say these techniques intensified the crash and have
continued to unnerve investors; defenders say they are just a
scapegoat and actually help stabilize the markets by keeping stocks
and futures prices from diverging.
   Despite the quarreling and delays in post-crash reforms, some
significant progress has been made as a result of the studies,
leading figures in the securities industry contend.
   ``All the studies have at least led to a de facto improvement,
some coordination among markets,'' said William Schreyer, chairman
of Merrill Lynch & Co. ``The fact they're all talking to each
other, working together, has been an encouraging step.''
   For example in July, the NYSE and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
proposed a plan for jointly managed ``circuit breakers'' _ trading
halts and price limits to discourage volatility and panic selling.
The NYSE also proposed altering its computer system to allow small
investors speedier access to the market.
   Since February, the NYSE has enforced a so-called ``collar''
that limits computerized trading when the Dow Jones industrial
average swings 50 points from the previous session's close.
   The circuit breakers, now being reviewed by federal regulators,
are expected to supercede the collar after it expires on Oct. 19,
the crash anniversary.
   In the over-the-counter market, the National Association of
Securities Dealers has tightened rules on its market makers, who
buy and sell stocks via a nationwide computerized network. In
addition, the NASD has said it will enable investors to find out if
their brokers have ever been in trouble.
   ``Basically, it seems to me that the studies were the
appropriate response as opposed to rushing in with a lot of
ill-advised regulation,'' said John Damgard, president of the
Futures Industry Association in Washington.
   ``I think this administration has done the proper thing,''
Damgard said. ``They are not anxious to change any of the basic
authorities. That doesn't mean they don't see the need for
improvement.''
   Nevertheless, others say, long-term risks to the markets would
persist even with the solutions advanced so far. Opponents of
trading halts and price limits, for example, contend these are
cosmetic measures that could hasten a market panic.
   ``I think these collars and caps and circuit breakers and all
that, are just devices which reduce the liquidity of the market,''
said Morris Mendelson, a finance professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ``I'm afraid that in a pinch, they
wouldn't work.''
   Nevertheless, he said, the studies have at least helped heighten
concern about the stock crash and whether it could happen again.
   ``Discussion is always useful. The more discussion the better,''
he said. ``One of the things I worry about is when we stop talking
about it.''

<HEAD>Program Trading, Wall Street Bogeyman, Has Declined But Not
Disappeared</HEAD>

   The story of last October's stock market crash
featured one notorious villain: program trading.
   Singled out by some studies as an important ingredient in the
collapse and its volatile aftermath, the high-tech strategy became
a hate object for small-time investors and a target of lawmakers
and market officials.
   The flood of criticism and scrutiny pushed the technique into
the background, but program trading lives on here and is beginning
to spread overseas.
   ``Certainly if you're looking post-crash, program trading hasn't
played much of a role in market activity,'' said Jack Barbanel, a
futures expert at the New York investment firm Gruntal & Co. ``But
that's not to say that if Wall Street resumes momentum to the
upside, the major players would not come back.'' In its most common
form, program trading is a computerized version of arbitrage, the
centuries-old practice of buying something in one market while
simultaneously selling its equivalent in another market for a
higher price, pocketing the difference.
   Program traders use computers to buy stock-index futures in
Chicago and sell groups of the underlying stocks in New York, or
vice versa, to profit from price gaps in the two markets.
   Critics say program trading strategies can dump tens of millions
of shares of stock on exchange floors without warning, jerking
prices around and sending ordinary investors fleeing for safety.
   Supporters of program trading say its effect on the markets is
negligible. If anything, they say, program trading helps stabilize
the stock and futures markets by keeping the price spread between
them from widening.
   As a defense, they point to the NYSE's own statistics, which
show program trading accounted for only 8.1 percent of average
daily volume in August and 10.1 percent the month earlier.
   In months prior to the crash, when prices were rising to record
highs, program trading volume on the NYSE was the same percentage
or less, some studies have showed.
   ``As far as the hysteria, it's totally unjustified,'' said
Sanford Grossman, an economics professor at Princeton University
who has studied program trading. ``The impact of program trading is
infinitesimal.''
   The technique has its share of enemies nevertheless. In
Washington, program trading has received extraordinary review, and
some legislators have been devising ways of strictly regulating the
strategy because they believe it is destroying the market's health.
   The New York Stock Exchange, also worried about the impact of
such trading, has taken several steps to limit the technique and
now requires member firms to report all program trades, both for
themselves and their clients.
   In Chicago, meanwhile, down payments have been raised for
stock-index futures, a crucial component of program trading,
thereby making it more expensive and less profitable.
   Perhaps more important, investment firms that once committed
large amounts of money to program trading have been forced to
divert capital to other areas, partly because the crash erased much
of their profits.
   In addition, most big firms have stated as a public relations
gesture that they have curtailed program trading for their own
accounts, though they'll still do it for customers.
   The net result, investment strategists say, has been a
significant decline in the amount of program trading, although its
influence occasionally is felt.
   Many contend the post-crash restrictions on program trading and
misguided public hostility against it inevitably will drive
important sources of Wall Street business overseas. Some say this
already has started.
   The London market, for example, is now serving as a conduit for
some U.S.-based program trading.
   In Japan, which only recently began trading in stock-index
futures, some U.S. investment strategists say privately that they
are looking at ways to use program trading there.
   Asked at a recent NYSE briefing about post-crash reform whether
the nation's biggest securities market is worried about this
potential exodus, executive vice president Donald Solodar was vague.
   ``We recognize the possibility exists, but don't see clear
evidence it's happening,'' he said. Nevertheless, he added, ``it's
a threat we have to watch out for.''

   Here are key elements of a post-crash reform proposal by the New
York Stock Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange aimed at what
both markets called ``enhancing investor confidence in the
marketplace.''
   The joint plan was announced July 7 and submitted to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading
Commission for review. The NYSE has said it hopes for approval by
the anniversary of the Oct. 19 crash.

   Under a one-year pilot program, temporary trading halts would be
triggered by pre-designated price movements. Trading on the NYSE
would stop for an hour if the Dow Jones industrial average fell 250
points, and for two hours if the average fell an additional 150
points the same day. At the CME, trading would stop for an hour if
the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract fell 30
points and for two hours if the S&P contract fell another 20 points
the same day. Both markets would coordinate the exact timing of the
halts.
   In addition, if the S&P contract fell 12 points, equivalent to a
approximately a 100-point fall in the Dow average, the futures
contract could not fall further for 30 minutes.
   At the NYSE, meanwhile, computerized program trading orders
would be diverted into a separate area to determine order
imbalances before they could be eligible for execution.
   The one-year experiment would supercede an NYSE restraint on
program trading triggered by a 50-point move in the Dow average.
The so-called ``collar'' has been in effect since February.

executive officer, said disclosing this data would ``bring
discipline to the market and further reinforce our commitment to
less volatile markets.''

<HEAD>Foreign Markets Show Mixed Progress in Post-Crash Recovery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market crash moved across time zones
like a stadium wave last October, but the recovery has proceeded
unevenly around the world.
   ``People are still quite nervous about stock markets,'' said
George Murnaghan, vice president at Rowe Price-Fleming
International in Baltimore.
   Nervous enough to slow trading in most countries, but not enough
to impede strong advances in some markets, particularly in Asia.
   George Mulvey, vice president for international research at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said volume has picked up recently on
many major exchanges and he views that as a sign that ``investors
are coming back to the market.''
   The world's 20 major stock markets were up about 9.5 percent in
late September compared with the end of October 1987, according to
an index developed by a research unit of Morgan Stanley & Co.
   The markets in Japan, France, Spain, Singapore-Malaysia and
Australia have posted double-digit gains in local currencies since
October, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International, while
the U.S. market was up 5.7 percent.
   The West German and British markets grew more slowly than the
U.S. market did, according to the index, while markets in Italy,
Norway and Switzerland posted small single-digit declines.
   The Japanese stock market, the world's largest, is up about 14
percent since the end of October, and several analysts said it was
the only major market to exceed its pre-crash highs.
   The Nikkei stock average, a measure roughly comparable to the
Dow Jones industrial average, surpassed its pre-crash high of
26,646.63 in April and has since risen an additional 3 percent.
   Japanese stocks have benefited from strong economic growth
trends, particularly in manufacturing, Shearson's Mulvey said. A
surge in corporate profits and consumer spending has also
contributed to the rise.
   But some analysts believe the market in Japan is ripe for a
fall. ``The market is so extended, at some point it has to be more
reasonably valued,'' said Murnaghan of Rowe Price.
   Mark Sladkus, a vice president at Morgan Stanley, said Japanese
stock prices are trading at about 50 times expected earnings, over
three times more than in the United States at the end of August. He
said the Japanese stock market has traditionally traded at big
multiples of earnings, but some analysts are wary about chances
that further price gains can be sustained.
   The markets in Singapore and Malaysia, up more than 29 percent,
have been spurred by strong regional growth trends, Shearson's
Mulvey said.
   Even the Hong Kong market, which closed for four days after the
crash, is up 14 percent.
   Rowe Price's Murnaghan said the Australian market, up nearly 25
percent, has benefited from the rise in commodity prices. The
market has a heavy concentration of commodity-based businesses.
   But not all of the high-performing foreign markets are in the
Pacific.
   The French market is up 19.8 percent and the market in Spain is
up 24.5 percent from October, according to the Morgan Stanley index.
   Murnaghan said takeover activity and strong economic
fundamentals have helped the French market, while Spain has drawn
strength from improving economic growth and progress toward
reducing inflation.
   Both markets have been helped by speculation about the impact of
the planned 1992 dismantling of many trade barriers within Europe,
he said.
   Nonetheless, the British and West German stock markets turned in
below-average performances since the crash, according to the Morgan
Stanley index.
   Murnaghan said the United Kingdom's market, up only 2.83 percent
since last October, has suffered from perceptions that the economy
was growing too fast, a worsening trade outlook, lower oil prices
and higher interest rates.
   West Germany's market was up 5 percent, but has suffered because
of slow growth, the high value of the West German mark and the
central bank's vigilance against inflation, Murnaghan said.
   The Italian market is off 1.75 percent since late October.
Mulvey said ongoing bank reforms there have hurt stock prices.
   One money manager, Jean-Marie Eveillard, who manages the Sogen
International Fund in New York, said institutional investors are
showing a greater willingness to invest internationally.
   ``As time goes by and the equity market gets better
psychologically, they are saying after all that maybe the crash was
an aberration, not a warning. I'm not in that camp, ... but that is
what some think.''
   Eveillard has about $15 million of the fund's $108 million
invested in foreign stocks, about the same ratio as in January.

<HEAD>Uncertainty Persists In Tokyo Market Despite Outstanding
Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo stock market has outperformed most major
world markets since last October's crash, but opinion is divided
over whether that's a sign of strength or reason to worry.
   ``There are so many uncertainties underlying in today's Tokyo
market,'' said Jeff Bahrenburg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch's Tokyo
unit. ``Though it appears to be a bull market at a glance, we have
to be very cautious because any of those uncertainties could bring
down the market any time.''
   It only took a few months for shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
to regain what they lost in the crash. Last April, the Nikkei stock
average, a measure roughly comparable to the Dow Jones industrial
average, broke its pre-crash high of 26,646.63, and now stands some
4 percent above that level, while other major markets are still
struggling to recover their losses.
   ``The Black Monday was only a nightmare in Tokyo, and it was
much more than a nightmare in New York and London,'' said Tetsuhiro
Miyake, head of the research section of Nomura Securities Co.
   Analysts who have confidence in the Tokyo market say the
prosperity should continue. With a total value of more than $3
trillion, the Japanese market is the world's largest, accounting
for over 40 percent of the value of all shares traded in the world
today.
   ``Given the current economic growth rate of about 5 percent and
surging corporate earnings, the current share price level on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange is sustainable at least until the end of the
year or possibly longer,'' said Thomas Zengage, an analyst at
International Business Information, an investment and consulting
firm in Tokyo.
   Analysts like Zengage say Tokyo share prices are not as high as
they appear if you take into account differences in accounting and
cultural backgrounds between Japan and New York or London.
   Cautious analysts insist Tokyo's triple-digit price-to-earning
multiples indicate shares are at least four times overpriced
compared to New York or London, but defenders argue the ratios
doesn't reflect Japanese reality.
   Japanese corporations tend to understate their profits by 25 to
30 percent, said IBI's Zengage and other analysts.
   ``It is partially because of the steep corporate tax in Japan,''
Zengage said. ``But it is also a tradition here to understate their
earnings. It is simply one of those things Japanese have been doing
for years and taken for granted.''
   The corporate tax rate goes as high as 52 percent.
   Also, business relations in Japan are considered more valuable
than short-term profits. Corporations commonly hold each other's
stocks, not as an investment but as a testimony of their commitment
to each other.
   As a result of such crossholdings, the actual number of shares
in the market is low compared with the number issued. Analysts and
securities company officials say as much as 70 to 80 percent of all
shares issued on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are locked in corporate
safes for years.
   ``This will automatically inflate share prices because it makes
the supply and demand relation heavily in favor of demand,''
Zengage said.
   The skyrocketing value of land, another peculiarity of Japan,
also strengthens share prices of companies that have substantial
land holdings. In Tokyo's main commercial district, one acre of
land can cost as much as $1.6 billion, according to Land Agency
statistics.
   ``Look closely at bullish shares,'' said Miyake. ``You will find
most of them are attributable to the value of the land they own.''
   Other analysts counter that land prices have started to decline
this year and warn that this will not only reduce the value of
shares but also shrink the amount investors can borrow to buy
equities.
   ``It's a really delicate balance now,'' said Ronald Talmage,
real estate specialist at N.M Rothschild and Sons Ltd., the
British-based investment bank. ``I really think it's this big
bubble that could burst at any time with any imbalance from one of
many sectors.''
   Many foreign investors and fund managers complain of the lack of
transparency in the Tokyo market. Keisuke Matsuura, a veteran
investment consultant, said many stock prices are artificially set
by four major securities companies, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and
Yamaichi Securities, who have practical control over 90 percent of
shares on the exchange.
   ``In the Western standard, what they do here is a pure
manipulation of share prices, but in the Japanese rule book, they
are just traditional practices no one wonders about,'' said
Matsuura.
   Such traditions may be reaching a turning point as a series of
stock-related scandals has caused the Finance Ministry to tighten
the Securities and Exchange Law on insider trading.
   The increased presence of foreigners in the market also is
affecting investment patterns of the Japanese, who used to regard
foreign firms' market analyses as impenetrable as technical
computer manuals. But now such analyses draw more attention from
the newly emerging, performance-oriented private Japanese investor,
said David Gerstenhaber, a senior analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.
in Tokyo.
   ``Japanese are beginning to rely less on brokers'
recommendations and make their own decisions. This may have a
significant impact on the Japanese investment patterns in the long
run,'' Gerstenhaber said.
   Despite concerns about overpriced shares and uncertainties
created by transitions under way, many Japanese contend the Tokyo
market can still provide a great investment opportunity.
   ``There is no doubt that shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange are
overpriced, but so what?'' said Nomura's Miyake. ``They have always
been high for years, and they still have a potential for growth
more than New York or London. This is the fact of life.''

<TEXT>
   The great crash of 1987 cast a giant shadow over
Britain's Big Bang.
   The collapse hit the British markets amid a wave of deregulation
_ nicknamed the Big Bang _ that promised to generate an
American-style boom in the securities business here.
   But after the crash, trading on the London Stock Exchange
dissolved to a trickle, and the atmosphere in the City, London's
financial district, turned from daring to cautious.
   The crash also triggered unexpected problems for Britain's
economy. And it could hamper Conservative Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's huge privatization program.
   ``People have been and still are looking over their shoulders at
the dramatic impact it had and are still a little bit nervous that
there could be a sort of mini-repeat of it,'' said Geoffrey
Lederman, head of equities market making at the London investment
firm Smith New Court Ltd.
   Surprisingly, the government's opponents haven't been clamoring
for increased regulation to prevent another crash, and the
securities industry's system of self-regulation remains intact.
   During the past 12 months, the market has wandered aimlessly
with a tendency to react fitfully to the release of economic
reports, takeover speculation and signals from Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index stands about
22 percent lower than its pre-crash level of 2,301.9.
   An average of 489 million domestic shares were traded daily in
August, down 41 percent from 825 million daily in August 1987.
   Investment firms have lost millions of dollars because of
reduced commissions, laid off an estimated 2,250 employees and cut
salaries and perks. There are some 28,000 securities industry
employees among the 273,000 workers in the City.
   It has been an especially rude awakening for firms that prepared
for Big Bang by diversifying and increasing staff at huge salaries.
   ``It was a sort of a Catch-22 situation. Before Big Bang one had
to get into the act and become a serious player,'' Lederman said.
``Now there are far too many players. There will have to be some
further reduction ....''
   In the months before the crash, the fierce competition already
was forcing a shakeout.
   Americans, more used to such competition, had been expected to
do particularly well in post-Big Bang London. U.S. banks, such as
Citibank, were eager to take advantage of a freedom not yet won in
their own country to engage in the securities business.
   But the U.S. companies found it ``like learning to sail in a
hurricane,'' one unidentified bank official said in a U.S.
government report on the subject.
   The impact of the crash on the British economy has confounded
experts who predicted a slowdown in consumer spending, which would
hobble economic growth.
   The British government, like others which feared a recession,
cut interest rates, and that increased spending. Economic growth
expanded to 4 percent, annual inflation rose to 5.7 percent by
August, and the country's trade deficit skyrocketed.
   ``The effect of that was to stimulate the U.K. economy when it
was growing already,'' said David Owen, an economist with the
London investment firm Kleinwort Grieveson Ltd.
   The government has reacted to this ``overheating'' by pushing up
base interest rates 4.5 percentage points since June to 12 percent,
and that worries investors and homeowners, alike.
   The Treasury insists the privatization program remains on
schedule and says the next sale, of British Steel Corp., will take
place at yearend. But many analysts believe Britons will now be
less keen to buy.
   The government has sold off billions of dollars' worth of
state-owned companies and the public has bought the shares eagerly
over the years.
   But the last sale, of the government's one-third stake in
British Petroleum Co. PLC, coincided with the crash, and flopped,
leaving most of $12 billion worth of stock in the underwriters'
hands.
   Looking ahead, the experts are divided about the overall
market's direction.
   Kevin Gardiner, a British economist at the London investment
firm Warburg Securities, predicted a significant rally within four
months, based on strong corporate profits.
   But Lederman said the market ``will jog gently downwards for the
next year or so. If the economic news does get worse, then again,
people will just not invest.''

<HEAD>Scrutiny Of Futures, Options Has Strengthened Markets, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finger-pointing began on the morning after,
with a Wall Street Journal article that traced the stock market's
collapse to the Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``The panic began here,'' was the lead on the Oct. 20, 1987,
story, which was headlined: ``Chicago's `Shadow Markets' Led Free
Fall In A Plunge That Began Right At Opening.''
   The Journal didn't blame the index futures market for the
shocking, 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. But
many others did, contending that the relatively low cost of futures
compared with the potential gains invited reckless speculation.
   Sophisticated ``program trading'' techniques that use computers
to trade huge amounts of stocks, stock-index futures and
stock-index options were scrutinized and criticized.
   Former Treasury Secretary Donald Regan even urged Congress in
May to force a halt to all trading of stock-index futures.
   A year after the crash, index futures and their even more
esoteric cousins, index options, still are traded and new versions
are planned. But trading volume is off sharply from the pre-crash
days and no one is predicting a return soon to volume levels
approaching those of the first three quarters of 1987.
   An index future is a contract to buy or sell, at a specified
time and price, a basket of stocks represented by a recognized
index. An index option is a right _ not a contractual obligation _
to buy or sell the stocks.
   Stock-market investors use futures and options to hedge against
adverse moves in the stock market. Speculators play the stock,
futures and options markets in hopes of profiting from the
constantly changing prices of all three.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's S&P 500 contract is the
world's leading index future. The Chicago Board Options Exchange's
S&P 100 index option contract is the most popular product of its
type.
   The Merc met some of the criticism of index futures by imposing
limits on the daily movement of prices and increasing the
speculative margin _ the amount of money speculators must put down
as a performance bond _ from about 6 percent to 15 percent of the
contract's face value.
   Officials say those changes, plus the New York Stock Exchange's
``collar'' on program trading, have cut both volume and volatility
in the index-futures market. The collar is scheduled to expire on
Oct. 19 and be replaced by a series of ``circuit breakers'' _
coordinated trading halts between the NYSE and the Merc.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, said
the spotlight that shone on Chicago's markets after the crash
illuminated their importance to modern financial management.
   ``It started with a lot of finger-pointing and knee-jerk
reactions based on a great deal of misconception and
misunderstanding,'' Melamed said.
   The futures-options industry responded with ``a major
educational offensive,'' he said, in which ``we were able to
present not just our case, but a whole learning process to people
in finance and within government who otherwise would never have had
the need, time or inclination to go through that learning curve.''
   Alger B. ``Duke'' Chapman, chairman of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, said it was ``inevitable,'' even before the crash, that
index options would receive closer attention.
   ``A lot of people were saying all along that these (stocks,
futures and options) are one market with different pieces. I have
no problem with that focus,'' he said.
   Average daily trading volume in the Merc's S&P 500 stock-index
future was down about 41 percent during the first eight months of
this year compared with the same period in 1987.
   On average, about 47,000 S&P 500 contracts changed hands each
trading day from January through August of this year compared with
80,000 per day during the first eight months of 1987.
   But Melamed said overall volume at the Merc was down only 7
percent, with most of the slack in the index-futures pit offset by
increased trading volume in Eurodollar and foreign currency futures.
   The CBOE, which has a less diverse mix of products than the
Merc, has suffered much more. Overall trading volume was down 44
percent in the first eight months of this year, with trading in S&P
100 index options off about 48 percent.
   Despite a 10 percent staff reduction, Chapman said the CBOE had
net income of less than $500,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,
compared with a profit of $9.6 million in fiscal 1987.
   In addition to those problems, the CBOE also faces a
class-action lawsuit claiming the exchange and some of its traders
are liable for $40 million in losses sustained by investors on Oct.
20, 1987, as financial markets reeled in the wake of the crash. The
CBOE says the lawsuit should be dismissed.
   Chapman said trading volume was slowly rebuilding as part of
``the normal healing process that comes after a major market
correction.''
   But Melamed said the limits and linkages that have been placed
on stocks and stock-index futures since the collapse cannot ensure
that investors will return to the financial markets.
   ``Investor confidence is not going to come back because we agree
to better coordination of market mechanisms, and we have. Investor
confidence is not going to come back because there's less
volatility in the market, and there is,'' he said.
   ``It is the macroeconomic, geopolitical issues _ foreign
exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, trade deficits _ that
bring confidence to the financial community,'' Melamed said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most futures prices of grain and soybeans opened
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by
selling linked to the advancing corn and soybean harvest.
   Harvest pressure remains the dominant force in the crop futures
market, overshadowing an increase in foreign demand for U.S. grain
and soybeans, analysts said.
   The Agriculture Department said late Wednesday that the Soviet
Union had purchased another 250,000 metric tons of U.S. corn, while
Mexico and Taiwan were awaiting word today on their bids for U.S.
soybeans.
   Wheat futures prices retreated on news that the USDA had
rejected Egypt's bid for 40,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S.
wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.
   Rejections of EEP wheat tenders have grown more frequent, and
rightly so, said grain specialist Ted Mao of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   ``Why keep promoting exports of a commodity that, if we have dry
weather again next year, we could have a shortage of?'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.15 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to } cent lower with December at $2.86{ a bushel; oats
were { cent to 1 cent lower with December at $2.45 a bushel;
soybeans were 4 cents lower to 5 cents higher with November at
$8.10 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .02 cent higher with October
at 71.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .28
cent higher with September at 80.20 cents a pound; live hogs were
.17 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 39.22 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .33 cent higher with February
at 49.20 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures closed mixed on Wednesday while pork futures
ended lower.

   The stock market rallied today, bidding to break
its recent stalemate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.49 points to
2,104.02 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 830 up, 391
down and 531 unchanged.
   Analysts said there was nothing in the news to stir up much
buying interest.
   However, they said, it appeared some traders were nibbling at
stocks this morning simply because the market hasn't sold off
lately despite a long list of worries and uncertainties.
   Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of
Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall
over the market.
   In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit
themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government
economic policy is headed after the election of a new president.
   Nevertheless, brokers said money managers at some investing
institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios
before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter,
which ends with Friday's session.
   Gainers in the blue-chip sector included Coca-Cola, up ~ at 44[;
International Business Machines, up { at 114]; Philip Morris, up ~

<HEAD>Drexel Judge Temporarily Blocks Defense From Seeking Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge overseeing the Securities and
Exchange Commission's civil fraud case against Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. temporarily has blocked defense requests to interview
potential witnesses the SEC may use.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack's order, issued Wednesday,
was not unexpected because SEC lawyers in other civil suits against
Drexel and defense attorneys have so far failed to agree on a
common structure for the preliminary fact-finding process, known as
discovery, that takes place before trial.
   The order means that at least for the immediate future,
attorneys for the Wall Street firm and other defendants in the SEC
case, notably Drexel's high-yield bond financier Michael Milken,
cannot compel pretrial testimony from any prospective government
witnesses.
   The most important of these witnesses is Ivan F. Boesky, the
imprisoned former takeover speculator who has provided much of the
information the SEC used to accuse Drexel and Milken on Sept. 7 of
widespread securities fraud. The defendants have denied the charges
and vowed to fight them in court.
   Pollack gave no indication when he would end the restriction,
but his order still allows defense attorneys to start reviewing
sensitive documents that the SEC also used to draft its charges.
   He also ordered a conference of attorneys Nov. 10 to set a date
for the start of pretrial witness interviews, known as depositions.
   Defense lawyers have expressed unhappiness that Pollack has
charge of the SEC case because they believe he is biased in the
government's favor. Their pretrial maneuvering has included
requests that Pollack disqualify himself.
   The 81-year-old judge so far has given no indication he will
surrender the case, although a defense-requested hearing on the
matter is set for Oct. 11.
   After a nearly two-year investigation, the SEC alleged that
Drexel, Milken and others secretly schemed with Boesky to trade on
inside information, manipulate stock, cheat Drexel clients and
commit other frauds.
   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office also has been conducting an
inquiry into Drexel's activities and there has been increasing
speculation criminal charges will be filed within the next few
months.

<HEAD>Asher Edelman: An American Raider in Paris</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asher B. Edelman is about to become an American
raider in Paris.
   With profitable runs on major companies like Lucky Stores and
Fruehauf Corp. under his belt, Edelman said in a rare interview
this week that he plans to transplant part of his investment
business overseas, where the takeover environment is less hostile
to the hostile.
   Despairing over the high prices of U.S. companies and the legal
roadblocks that impede the swift stroke of the raider's hand,
Edelman said he's looking to become ``very, very active in Europe.''
   For at least six months a year, the 48-year-old Edelman plans to
make camp in his computer-equipped Paris apartment and work through
a holding company. The Edelman Companies, a menagerie of trading
operations and limited partnerships, will continue to operate in
New York.
   Perhaps to prepare the takeover canvas he intends to paint,
Edelman recently bought a 5 percent stake in the British
conglomerate Lonrho PLC. The foreign press, relatively unacquainted
with brash, American-style dealmakers, has been humming over just
what he's up to and why he would want the company, whose most
valuable assets include the Metropole and Princess hotel chains in
Britain, Acapulco, Bermuda and the Bahamas, as well as African gold
fields.
   The eccentric art collector who's admittedly more comfortable in
the company of ballerinas than bankers is rumored to be courting
other large Lonrho shareholders. Edelman had no comment but notes
``there's been no bid.''
   Edelman's personal wealth is estimated at about $100 million,
and he is believed to have amassed a warchest for takeovers five
times that amount. Hence, Lonrho Chief Executive Tiny Rowland said:
``We are taking him very seriously.''
   Lonrho aside, Edelman has warm words for the Continent. First
off, the Common Market lacks the tremendous deficits that the
United States shoulders. And Europe already has emerged
successfully from what Edelman calls ``a social revolution'' that
is only in its embryonic stages here.
   He notes that ``European businesses already have faced up to
their social responsibilities,'' like kicking in for employees'
medical benefits, something that many American companies haven't
been forced to do.
   Trade barriers are softening, and European companies have an
increasingly urgent need to expand their share of what in 1992
officially will become a single, unified market of more than 300
million people.
   ``For all of this to work, European companies have to merge,
they have to consolidate, they have to go across borders,'' said
Edelman, relaxing in his art-bedecked office.
   He also believes European companies are less expensive and
relatively unencumbered by anti-takeover devices like poison pills.
Shareholders, he says gleefully, ``have ultimate power over the
company.''
   Edelman is no stranger to Europe. Fluent in French, he spent
four years running the French and Belgian operations of the
investment firm Carter, Berlind & Weill. He holidays overseas
several months a year, this summer piloting his yacht through the
Mediterranean to visit archaeological digs.
   The decision to focus more exclusively on Europe came after his
unsuccessful bid for Burlington Industries Inc.last year.
   Though he reaped an estimated $60 million, Edelman said the deal
degenerated into a ``horrendous'' and ``saddening'' exchange,
punctuated by accusations that he and his partner, Canada's
Dominion Textile Inc., had received inside information from a
former Burlington employee.
   Ultimately Burlington was taken private, assuming $3 billion in
debt in the process. Spokesman Bryant Haskins said the resulting
string of staff reductions and asset sales ``was like curing an
in-grown toenail by cutting off a leg.
   ``We are still not too happy with Mr. Edelman. We felt that
being put into play in a hostile takeover attempt allegedly using
inside information was certainly not the way to go about acquiring
a company,'' he said.
   For Edelman, the incident convinced him that ``there were just
too many legal hassles and not enough economic substance to getting
deals done'' here.
   Raised on Long Island's manicured south shore, Edelman earned a
degree in economics at Bard College and then moved into the
brokerage business. In 1969 he went out on his own, changing course
over the years from brokering to arbitrage to takeovers while
posting an average net return of 30 percent annually for his fewer
than 100 well-heeled clients.
   Edelman not only has challenged the corporate status quo but the
academic status quo as well. Last year, while teaching a course at
Columbia University entitled ``Corporate Raiding: The Art of War,''
Edelman offered a $100,000 ``finder's fee'' to any student who
spotted a takeover target.
   Columbia, irked that he would have students do his legwork,
forced him to withdraw the offer. But according to Larry Barth, a
student in the class, Edelman ``had no problem mixing academia with
cash incentives.''
   On Wall Street, Edelman is held in varying degrees of esteem.
``Probably in general people have not made a lot of money with
Asher like they have with Carl Icahn or Boone Pickens,'' said one
arbitrager, whose job it is to follow the dealmakers in betting on
takeover stocks.
   ``He's out there for himself, and if you want to come along,
that's dandy, but it's caveat emptor,'' said the dealer who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The string of companies that lies in Edelman's wake is lengthy.
Fruehauf fended him off in 1986 in a leveraged buyout that resulted
in divestitures and an $80 million net loss for the year. And
Foster Wheeler Corp. charged in court last year that Edelman and
his associates manipulated the company's stock in a takeover bid.
   Although he won Ponderosa Inc., Edelman sold out at no profit
after cutting overhead and employees. He contends the companies
he's touched are more efficient after such changes.
   No one can call Edelman a ``typical'' businessman. He brands
himself _ emphatically so _ as ``avante garde'' and ranks his
interests pyramid style with family at the top, followed by the
arts, the community and business, which is conspicuously last.
   Edelman has hand-picked an impressive art collection and spends
at least a full day each week gallery-hopping, sometimes in his
chauffeur-driven Jeep.
   Swerving through the curved corridors of his office, a visitor
comes upon a secretary working near a large piece of squashed
metal. ``It's a Chamberlain,'' she sighs, referring its creator,
John Chamberlain.
   Within his 15-room Manhattan apartment, objects d'arte are not
confined to a 57-foot gallery. Indeed, a metal sculpture is
suspended above the dining room table _ another Chamberlain.
   Recently his eye has strayed from contemporary works to
antiquities and European art of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. As
testament to his diversity, a second-century sculpture of a Roman
emperor has replaced two, 500-pound boxes by Donald Judd, now on
loan to the Whitney Museum.
   ``He has a real sincere interest in the arts,'' said one former
business associate. ``He's more interesting than many people give
him credit for and can certainly be provocative. I like the fact
that he has these pretentions.''

   Share prices surged late in the session to end
stronger Thursday on the London Stock Exchange, boosted by a
healthy start on Wall Street and continued takeover speculation
affecting particular stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 16.5
points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,829.
   Volume was relatively strong as 562.2 million shares changed
hands, up from 418.3 million shares traded Wednesday. The increased
turnover led to market talk that a significant computer-generated
buying program had been carried out in the morning, but there was
no confirmation of this.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 18.85
points higher to 2,104.37 as London trading tapered off.
   Dealers said London shares were pulled higher by Wall Street's
confident movements. Several market watchers suggested that London
equities could advance still further if the New York market could
sustain the 2,100 level over the next few trading sessions.
   Dealers said the tone of the London market has felt positive
since Tuesday's release of better-than-expected British trade
figures for August. With a handful of leading stocks in the
100-share index still considered prime takeover bid candidates, the
market is unlikely to come under much selling pressure in the short
term, analysts said.

   Symbol Technologies Inc., the dominant maker of
bar-code scanning equipment, has agreed to buy one of its major
customers in a white-knight deal announced by the companies
Thursday.
   The $23-a-share cash deal to buy MSI Data Corp. values MSI at
$120 million and saves the company from a hostile tender offer by
rival Telxon Corp., which had raised its offer on Wednesday to $20
a share.
   Symbol Technologies, of Bohemia, N.Y., has about 90 percent of
the portable laser scanner market, according to a recent report by
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   MSI Data and Telxon are the leaders in the hand-held data
computer industry, with a combined market share of at least 50
percent, Prudential-Bache said. At least half of the computers use
some form of laser scanner plugged into them.
   Telxon, based in Akron, Ohio, said Thursday it had no comment on
the definitive merger agreement between Symbol Technologies and
MSI, based in Costa Mesa, Calif.
   Symbol Technologies already owns 4.5 percent of MSI Data, the
companies said.

   Japan is moving to the center of the world
financial stage, stepping into a leadership role temporarily
vacated by U.S. preoccupation with the presidential campaign.
   ``Never before have I seen so many people saying, `Japan,
Japan,''' Satoshi Sumita, Japan's central bank governor, told
reporters at this week's annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.
   Japan captured the attention of thousands of top financial
officials and bankers meeting in West Berlin with an offer to help
ease one of the world's most serious problems _ the $1.2 trillion
Third World debt.
   It also suggested that the U.S. dollar, the world's leading
currency, be given less weight in the holdings that governments
keep in their coffers. The implication was that Japan would like to
see its own currency, the yen, take on greater importance in
international financial transactions.
   A high-ranking official of the Japanese Finance Ministry,
speaking on condition of anonymity, confessed to Japanese
reporters, ``Japan's presence was so powerful that I almost felt
frightened.''
   The U.S. role at the meeting was diminished by an uncertain
dollar, high trade and budget deficits and preoccupation with the
November presidential election.
   Economists said it was about time Japan, the world's No. 2
economic power after the United States, exerted more influence.
   John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute of
International Economics in Washington, said, ``People have been
anticipating a more active Japanese role for 10 or 15 years. Up to
now, they've always remained almost deferential.''
   Japan's more visible performance likely stems from its ability
to successfully manage its economy and reduce its heavy dependence
on sales of export goods, economists said.
   ``It's a sign of self-confidence ... They feel they've been most
successful,'' said Tim O'Dell, an international economist at the
London brokerage firm Phillips & Drew.
   Williamson agreed, ``It stems from their macro-economic success
in showing they are not dependent on exports.''
   Japan had long relied on sales of goods to foreign countries to
drive its economy. But analysts say in the last year it has been
able to promote growth based on domestic demand.
   At the same time, the United States has been criticized for
failing to correct its federal budget and trade deficits, which
foreign officials fear will derail the world economic expansion.
   The dollar has lost some of its luster, although it has been
gaining strength in recent months. The United States and its major
trading partners had agreed three years ago to devalue the dollar
to narrow the U.S. trade gap and stave off protectionist sentiment
in Congress.
   A weaker dollar makes American products more competitive on
overseas markets while making imports more expensive in the United
States.
   The Japanese chose this week's meeting, the largest annual
gathering of financial brass, to make their move, five weeks before
the presidential election when the U.S. focus is at home.
   O'Dell said the Japanese used the ``hiatus'' of the presidential
campaign ``to take the opportunity to increase their presence.''
   Newly installed Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady kept a low
profile at the meeting, unlike his predecessor, James A. Baker III.
   Baker, who resigned as treasury chief to head the presidential
campaign of Vice President George Bush, was a powerful force in
international financial affairs.
   He was credited with fashioning in 1985 the industrial
countries' strategy for dealing with the Third World debt problem.
The ``Baker Plan'' calls in part for providing new loans to
developing countries that enact economic liberalization policies.
   Top finance leaders chose this week not to change course. They
agreed to maintain stable financial markets and supported the
current debt strategy.
   Still, Japan persisted. It offered a new way to ease the money
woes of big debtors, like Brazil and Mexico, which have combined
debts of $220 billion.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa floated the idea in June at the
Toronto economic summit attended by seven key world leaders. It
drew little support but prompted interest.
   Sumita fleshed out the plan, under which some of the countries'
foreign debts would be converted into bonds. Interest on the bonds
would be backed by money the debtors deposited in escrow accounts
with the IMF. Sumita also said the Japanese Export-Import Bank was
willing to make additional loans through the IMF to debtor
countries.
   World Bank President Barber Conable called the Japanese
``outward looking.''
   They tend, he said, ``to view (economic) development financing
in a much more favorable light than many other developed nations,''
he said.

<DATELINE>NEWTON, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maytag Corp. said Thursday it is discussing
the sale of its Jenn Industries and Magic Chef Air Conditioning
operations as part of its effort to concentrate on major appliances.
   Maytag Chairman Daniel J. Krumm would not identify the potential
buyers for Jenn Industries of Indianapolis, Ind., and Magic Chef of
Bellevue, Ohio.
   ``These are good operations, but the products they manufacture
do not serve markets that are significant to Maytag, nor do they
contribute substantially to our earnings,'' Krumm said in a
statement.
   Combined sales of the two companies totaled $86.7 million in
1987, when Maytag reported total net sales of $1.9 billion.
   Jenn Industries, which employs about 100 people, makes power
exhaust units and ventilation equipment. Magic Chef, with about 400
employees, makes residential furnaces and air conditioners.
   ``Selling these operations will permit us to concentrate efforts
and financial resources in our core businesses of full-size major
appliances and vending equipment, which is where we can achieve the
latest long-term benefit,'' Krumm said.
   The planned sales are part of a reorganization that began
shortly after Maytag and Magic Chef merged in 1986. The company's
main brands include Admiral, Hardwick, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag
and Norge.

<HEAD>Activists' `Tribunal' Ends Mock Trial, Denounces World Bank-IMF
Policies</HEAD>

   Internationally known activists ended a mock trial
of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Thursday with
a ``verdict'' that the organizations perpetuate poverty in heavily
indebted Third World nations.
   The ``Permanent People's Tribunal'' said World Bank figures show
that ``350 million people live in absolute poverty'' throughout the
world and that ``the majority of humankind is worse off now than 10
years ago.''
   The tribunal urged the United Nations to arrange an
international conference on the Third World debt crisis and called
for a ``widespread write-off of the debt.''
   The three-day ``trial'' was staged as World Bank and IMF
delegates held their annual joint meeting in another part of West
Berlin.
   Several renown activists participated in the mock trial,
including Americans George Wald, who shared the 1967 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine, author Cheryl Payer and sociologist Susan
George.
   The tribunal said the flow of resources out of poor countries to
richer ones is steadily increasing to pay off enormous debts, a
situation it called ``profoundly unjust and (an) affront to every
reasonable and humane person.''
   As a result, the tribunal said, ``in places where a decade ago
there were primary schools and medical centers, no education or
health care is now provided. In such places, people have lost
hope.''
   In a speech ending the proceedings, novelist Eduardo Galeano of
Uruguay denounced the economic policies of the United States and
other major industrial nations toward poor countries.
   He charged that conditions attached to financial aid offered to
heavily indebted Third World countries have crippled those lands.
   ``The international finance police have a tight hold on
everything ... except sunshine and rainfall,'' Galeano said,
sparking applause from most of the 300 people in the audience at
West Berlin's Free University.
   ``The more they (people in those countries) pay, the more they
owe. They have to work longer to have less and less,'' Galeano said.
   Meanwhile, he charged, ``The great bankers of the world ...
possess more wealth than kings''
   In its ``verdict,'' the tribunal said the World Bank and the IMF
have breached ``the Charter of the United Nations in that they have
not prompted higher standards of living, full employment and
conditions of economic and social progress and development'' in
poor countries.
   The IMF has fashioned rescue packages to help financially
troubled Third World countries; the World Bank provides them with
aid for economic development.
   The tribunal said the monetary policies of United States, Japan
and West Germany are at least partly responsible for Third World
poverty.
   The United States, the statement said, has contributed to the
``degradation of financial markets through its huge borrowing to
cover its military expenditures without levying more taxes on its
own population.''
   Analysts say the large federal budget deficit in the United
States keeps interest rates higher, attracting savings from
foreigners anxious to earn more money on their investments.
   Japan and West Germany, the tribunal charged, are using ``their
own surpluses to finance the American deficit instead of
transferring resources to Third World countries.''
   Both the bank and the IMF declined requests to send
representatives to the trial, saying they have their own
institutional control mechanisms to monitor their operations.
   When told about the verdict, World Bank President Barber Conable
replied: ``That's life.''
   During the World Bank-IMF talks, the Third World debt problem
was one of the key topics of discussion. Financial officials from
poor countries urged the rich nations to do more to ease their
burdens.
   The Permanent People's Tribunal is part of the International
Basso Foundation, a Rome-based human rights organization founded by
Lelio Basso, an Italian political activist who died in 1978.

   The head of the International Monetary Fund on
Thursday praised the United States for its help in renewing efforts
to stabilize world currency exchange markets.
   As the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank ended, IMF chief
Michel Camdessus cited U.S. support for cooperation among the seven
major industrial countries in sustaining income growth and money
rates.
   The so-called Group of Seven includes Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the United States.
   Camdessus said he also agreed with the United States that the
strategy for dealing with the Third World's $1.2 billion debt
should be flexible. He and representatives of the major industrial
countries have insisted that debt reduction be done a case-by-case
basis.
   ``I am quite happy with the support,'' Camdessus said.
   There have been reports of a rift earlier in the meeting between
the U.S. government and the IMF over loans offered by the World
Bank to Argentina, before Argentina entered into a separate
arrangement with the IMF. The Reagan administration has supported
the World Bank loans.
   But Camdessus and Barber B. Conable, the American who is
president of the World Bank, both said Thursday that they had
consulted each other on the Argentine loans.
   The IMF chief defended the U.S. administration against criticism
that it is falling behind on plans to increase contributions from
member governments. A decision is due April 30.
   Such a plan would enable the fund to expand lending to Third
World countries in return for promises of policy changes by
borrower governments so that they will be better able to repay.
   The Reagan administration has used its influence to delay the
decision so that it did not have to ask Congress in the same year
for a contribution to both the IMF and World Bank. Congress is now
considering the World Bank contribution.
   Conable said the new capital will help the bank to increase its
lending to $25 billion a year in 1992. It now lends about $17
billion annually and is a major source of loans aimed at raising
Third World living standards.
   In his closing remarks, Camdessus said he sensed broad agreement
on where the world needs to go. ``The world economy is moving on
the right track,'' he said.

   The stock market staged a broad advance today,
showing signs of life after the stalemate of the past several weeks.
   Analysts said there was no single development in the news to

   ``After that they jumped on board, with a little encouragement
from the bond market.''

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans posted
modest losses Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
selling linked to the accelerating harvest and disappointment in
the lack of significant export business.
   Corn prices also were pressured by ideas that the government
will relax its corn planting restrictions in the 1989 price-support
program in a move to replenish supplies thinned by this summer's
drought, said Ted Mao, grain specialist in New York with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``Maybe people are reacting to the fact that they know the
set-aside program won't be as stringent next year,'' he said. ``The
government will try to put back some of the acreage that was taken
out this year.''
   The Midwestern corn and soybean harvest continued to dominate
the market, pushing prices lower on concerns about new supplies
coming to market.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.13 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 7} cents lower with December at $2.86{ a bushel; oats
were 3{ cents to 4 cents lower with December at $2.41{ a bushel;
soybeans were 4{ cents to 9 cents lower with November at $8.08 a

<HEAD>Firm Allegedly Subjected to Boesky Stock Parking Scam Gets
Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fischbach Corp., a leading electrical contractor
once targeted in an alleged stock parking scheme involving Ivan
Boesky, Victor Posner and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., received a
$98 million cash takeover offer Thursday from the head of a real
parking company.
   An investor group led by Andrew N. Heine, chairman and chief
executive officer of the national car-parking company Kinney System
Inc., said in a brief statement that it offered $25 a share for
each of Fischbach's approximately 3.91 million common shares.
   Edwin Wilinski, Fischbach executive vice president, said he had
no comment on the offer.
   The announcement caused Fischbach's stock to surge $2.87{ a
share to $17.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Fischbach, one of the nation's largest electrical contractors,
drew prominent attention in April 1987 because it was identified by
the federal government as the object of a criminal conspiracy
described in a guilty plea by Boesky, the former stock speculator
now serving a three-year prison term.
   The conspiracy concerned stock parking, a fraudulent practice in
which the ownership of stock is disguised in someone else's name.
Stock parking can be used to avoid reporting requirements to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and to quietly accumulate stock
for hostile takeovers.
   Earlier this month, the SEC alleged as part of a massive
securities fraud complaint against Drexel that its high-yield bond
chief Michael Milken and Posner, a Miami industrialist, were
co-conspirators in the Fischbach stock-parking arrangement with
Boesky.
   The SEC said the alleged arrangement enabled Posner to
ultimately acquire a controlling interest in Fischbach and become
chairman. The defendants in the SEC case have denied the
accusations.
   In a telephone interview, Heine called his offer friendly and
unsolicited. He also said the offer and its timing were unrelated
to the SEC case against Drexel and the others, but ``obviously,
we're aware of all that.''
   Heine declined to identify his associates in the takeover offer
but said it had nothing to do with Kinney, which he once helped
acquire via a leveraged buyout, a transaction in which buyers use
borrowed money and repay it with the acquired company's assets or
earnings.
   He said the Fischbach transaction also would be structured as a
leveraged buyout but declined to specify if he would sell any of
the company's assets to finance it.
   ``I really don't want to go into a game plan at this time,'' he
said.
   Based in New York, Fischbach has about 80 offices and 9,000
employees nationwide. It earned about $36 million on revenue of
$1.1 billion last year.

<HEAD>Top Officers at Winnebago Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOREST CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnebago Industries Inc.'s two top
operating officers have resigned from the recreational vehicle
manufacturer, replaced by a seven-member management council.
   Stepping aside were Gerald W. Gilbert, president and chief
executive officer, and Richard Berreth, executive vice president.
The two resigned Wednesday and the company announced the change
Thursday.
   In a prepared statement, the company did not elaborate on why
the two top officers had quit.
   Berreth, 52, implied that company directors weren't satisfied
with the firm's growth in recent months, although he declined to be
specific. He said he was disappointed with having to resign but
that he had only good things to say about the company.
   ``From my standpoint, it's an excellent company with an
excellent product line and a good group of people. I would prefer
to let the company speak for itself (on the shakeup). I'm certainly
disappointed in not being with the team but I certainly wish them
the best of luck,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home.
   ``I'm going to take 30 days and do a little fishing, a little
hunting and decide what I'm going to do when I grow up. I want to
make it clear I'm not throwing mud at the company,'' he said.
   Attempts to reach Gilbert at his home were unsucessful. Company
officials would not elaborate on the prepared statement.
   Berreth said he had been with Winnebago for 26 months.
   The financial slide for the firm apparently began with the stock
market crash a year ago, when Winnebago lost about $8.6 million.
Because of those losses, the company posted an overall $1.9 million
loss in the fiscal quarter ending Nov. 28, 1987, compared to a
profit of $2.8 million the year earlier.
   ``Obviously, we took quite a hit,'' Gilbert said at the time.
``But over a five-year period of time or so, we made awfully good
money in the market.'' The company said its investments had earned
an average of 18.5 percent before taxes.
   Profits continued to fall early this year. In a second quarter
statement, the motor home maker said profits dropped to $1.3
million from $6.3 million in the previous second quarter ending
Feb. 27. Per-share earnings dropped to 5 cents compared to 25 cents
a year earlier and sales dropped to $94 million from $97 million.
   At the time, industry analyst Frank Rolfes said profits were
weakened partly because Winnebago underpriced its new Super Chief
models to gain a market share.
   ``It's very successful saleswise, but they're not making any
money on it,'' he said.
   The company recently announced it would begin making motor homes
for export to Japan.
   For the first six months of the company's fiscal year, the firm
lost $680,000, or 3 cents a share, against a profit of $9.1 million
the previous year.
   Berreth said year-end figures show an improvement but he would
not be specific since the company has yet to release the data.
   Directing the new management team will be Bryan A. Hayes, vice
president of sales and marketing. Other members include Jerome V.
Clouse, vice president and treasurer; Edwin Barker, vice president
and controller; Sharon L. Hansen, director of administration;
Richard B. Carlson, vice president of engineering; Raymond M.
Beebe, vice president and general counsel; and Frank Rotta,
director of public relations.

<HEAD>Eveready Announces First AA Size Lithium Battery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eveready Battery Co. Inc. on Thursday announced
the first lithium battery in the widely used AA size, a development
that was hailed as a breakthrough by scientists and security
analysts.
   The pencil-thin AA batteries make up about half of all batteries
sold and are the fastest-growing segment of the industry, said St.
Louis-based Eveready, a unit of Ralston Purina Co.
   Eveready said the new ``Lithium Plus'' battery, to be available
early next year, will last up to twice as long as alkaline
batteries in many uses and will have a shelf life of 10 years or
more.
   ``It's a terrific segment of the market to have hit,'' said
Brian Fernandez, an analyst at Brean Murray, Foster Securities Inc.
``It's an area where a premium battery can make rapid market
penetration.''
   The suggested retail price will be $5 to $6 a pair, compared
with $1.50 to $3 a pair for alkaline batteries, J. Patrick Mulcahy,
Eveready's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview.
   ``It's going to cream off the top of the market,'' he said. He
declined to reveal market-share projections.
   AA size batteries are widely used in cameras, flash units,
stereo headphone devices and toys. Fernandez predicted that many
people would be willing to pay extra for a long-lasting battery for
such items.
   The batteries will be made at an Eveready plant in St. Albans,
Vt., using a complicated process on which the company has applied
for patents, Mulcahy said.
   In a news release, Eveready quoted supporting statements by
battery experts at Brookhaven National Laboratories in Long Island,
N.Y., and the Battery Technology Center of Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. The experts could not be reached by phone
for comment on Thursday.
   Until now lithium batteries have been in narrow, specialized
segments of the market such as 9-volt batteries.
   Eveready managed to squeeze the lithium technology down to the
AA size by making many wraps of thin, foil-like electrodes in a
kind of jelly roll, said Gilbert Merritt, the director of technical
resources.
   Different chemicals had to be used to achieve the 1.5 volt
standard that is used in AA batteries, he said.
   Merritt said the complexity of the production technology means
it will take some time before the company gears up to large-scale
production.
   Fernandez said that by his estimation, Eveready has the biggest
share of the U.S. replacement battery market, followed by Duracell
Inc., Eastman Kodak Co., and several Japanese companies, including
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. and Hitachi Ltd. Eveready
and Duracell are roughly even in the alkaline segment.
   The new battery will be unveiled next week at Photokina, the
annual photography industry show in Cologne, West Germany.

   Assets of the nation's 452 money market mutual
funds fell $267.6 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $266.97 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $654.0 million increase in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 223 general purpose funds fell $140.8 million to $84.68
billion, assets of 103 broker-dealer funds rose $28.2 million to
$113.38 billion, and assets of 126 institutional funds fell $155.0
million to $68.91 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.43 percent from 7.42 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.40 percent from 7.36 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
34 days, the same as the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.02 percent as of Wednesday from 6.01 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.11 percent from 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.75
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.72 the
previous week. Yields were 8.04 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.03
percent; 8.31 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.30 percent; and
8.59 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.58 percent.

   The stock market put together a broad rally
Thursday, showing signs of life after the stalemate of the past few
weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 33.78 to
2,119.31, its highest close since it stood at 2,119.13 on Aug. 5.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,065 up, 412 down and 478 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board stepped up to 155.79
million shares from 113.72 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 181.29 million shares.
   Analysts said there was no single development in the news to
``explain'' the rally.
   However, they said, it appeared some traders were bidding for
stocks simply because the market hasn't sold off lately despite a
long list of worries and uncertainties.
   Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of
Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall
over the market.
   In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit
themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government
economic policy is headed after the election of a new president.
   Nevertheless, brokers said money managers at some investing
institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios
before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter,
which ends with Friday's session.
   ``The market has been lifeless for so long. It started to move
up, and gave traders a sense of direction,'' said Hugh Johnson at
First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   ``After that they jumped on board, with a little encouragement
from the bond market.''
   Though analysts acknowledged that the connection might seem
far-fetched, they also suggested that investors' spirits got a lift
from the successful launch of the space shuttle Discovery.
   Gainers in the blue-chip sector included Coca-Cola, up ~ at 44\;
International Business Machines, up 1{ at 115]; General Electric,
up { at 43}, and Philip Morris, up 1| at 97|.
   Fischbach Corp. jumped 7\ to 20[. A group of investors said it
was making a $25-a-share offer for the company.
   C3 Inc. gained 2 to 13[. Knoll Capital Management said it
proposed to acquire C3 for $13 a share, and might raise the offer
if the company provides it with information that warrants a higher
price.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $30.13 billion, or
1.13 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.75 to 153.78.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 4.22 to 312.68, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.51 at 272.59.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Slightly; Gold Prices Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced slightly Thursday, kept in
check by fears that central banks would enter the foreign-exchange
market and send the U.S. currency lower.
   Gold prices were mixed, rising overseas but falling in New York
trading. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of
$396.50 for a troy ounce of gold, down $1.25 from late Wednesday.
   Ted Wolicki, a trader with Continental Illinois National Bank &
Trust Co. in Chicago, said the dollar rose amid rumors of a
possible reshuffling of Soviet leaders.
   Extraordinary meetings are scheduled in Moscow this week for the
Communist Party Central Committee and the Soviet parliament, the
Supreme Soviet. A high-level source said Thursday a shakeup was in
the offing.
   However, Wolicki said, the rumors were ``just an excuse for the
dollar to take the market a little higher.''
   Traders were buying gingerly, because ``it looks like the
central banks will probably step in if the dollar starts going up
again,'' Wolicki said.
   On Monday, the central banks of several nations, including the
U.S. Federal Reserve, were reported to have sold dollars to put a
lid on the currency's advance. The banks' move followed a
reaffirmation by major industrial nations of their commitment to
keep currency prices stable.
   Wolicki said the dollar was ``basically trendless, going
sideways for a while,'' but could start drifting lower.
   In overseas trading, the dollar was also restrained by fears of
central bank intervention. However, said one dealer, ``The real
demand for dollars is still out there.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 134.35 yen.
Later in London it was quoted at 134.23 yen, and in New York, the
dollar rose to 134.37 yen from late Wednesday's 134.02 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6825 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6840 late Wednesday. The
dollar was also a winner against the pound in New York, where
sterling was quoted at $1.6810, down from late Wednesday's price of
$1.6905.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8826 West German marks, up from
1.8767; 1.5942 Swiss francs, up from 1.5897; 6.4065 French francs,
up from 6.3877; 1,402.25 Italian lire, up from 1,398.87; and 1.2182
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2212.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday's
quotes, included: 1.8823 West German marks, up from 1.8785; 1.5930
Swiss francs, up from 1.5920; 6.4055 French francs, up from 6.3980;
2.1210 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1182; 1,402.60 Italian lire, up
from 1,401.00; 1.2175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2215.
   Gold slipped to $396.80 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange
in New York from late Wednesday's $398.20.
   Overseas, gold traders made an early attempt to push the metal
back above the $400 barrier that it crashed through last week, but
falling oil prices and large sales of bullion by producers
restrained the gold advance.
   Gold rose in London to $397.75 a troy ounce, up from $396.50
late Wednesday, while in Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose to
$397.50 from $396.50 late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to $403.63.
   Silver prices were higher. On the Comex in New York, silver rose
to $6.173 a troy ounce from $6.166 late Wednesay. In London, silver
was quoted at $6.20 a troy ounce, up 5 cents from Wednesday.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Soar On Tight Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices scored sharp gains Thursday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as the market continued to rally on indications
of tightening supplies and rising demand.
   Elsewhere, precious metals futures were mixed; grains and
soybeans retreated; livestock and energy futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   The expiration Wednesday of the copper contract for September
delivery at an eight-month high of $1.209 a pound made October the
spot contract and traders lost no time in bidding up its price.
   Copper for October delivery settled at $1.1735 a pound, up 2.35
cents from Wednesday's final price. Closely watched December, the
most active contract, surged 2.40 cents to $1.0945 and posted a new
life-of-contract high for the third straight day.
   ``There are still concerns about tightness in nearby physical
supplies,'' said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
in New York. ``Assuming the majority consensus that we are in a
peak consumption period is valid, demand for copper in the coming
months should propel the December contract up to the levels of
September or exceed it.''
   Analyst Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York noted that the price premium of December over the March 1989
contract widened to 9.70 cents from 8.45 cents. The widening of
this gap, which is known as three-month backwardation, is a key
indicator of a tight-supply market.
   The September contract expired at a nearly 14-cent premium to
December.
   ``The tightness that seemed to be suggested by what was taking
place in September would seem to be suggested by the December
contract as well,'' Sloane said.
   Platinum futures surged for the second straight day on the New
York Mercantile Exchange in reaction to predictions that demand
will outstrip supplies during the next five years.
   Gold futures retreated and silver advanced in light trading on
the Comex. Platinum futures settled $6.10 to $6.40 higher with
October at $500.80 a troy ounce; gold was $1.80 to $1.90 lower with
October at $396.80 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent
higher with October at $6.173 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures posted moderate losses on the Chicago
Board of Trade, pressured by selling linked to the accelerating
harvest and disappointment in the lack of significant export
business.
   Wheat settled 3\ cents to 6 cents lower with December at $4.12}
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 7{ cents lower with December at
$2.86{ a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 5 cents lower with December
at $2.42 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8\ cents lower with
November at $8.08 a bushel.
   Pork futures rebounded from Wednesday's steep losses in a flurry
of repositioning ahead of the government's release Friday afternoon
of its quarterly hogs-and-pigs report.
   Most experts expect the report to show that pork producers
scaled back their herd expansion plans and increased their sales of
hogs for slaughter because of the summer drought.
   Cattle futures ended mixed in directionless trading in extremely
light volume.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent lower with October at
71.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with September at 80.22 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent to
.98 cent higher with October at 39.47 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .88 cent to 1.30 cents higher with February at 50.32
cents a pound.
   Energy futures settled mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in a day of listless trading.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 19 cents
lower with November at $13.92 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to
.38 cent higher with October at 39.54 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .80 cent lower to .25 cent higher with October at
46.42 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures were up sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the
Standard & Poor's 500 index leaped 4.15 points to 275.70. Each full
point is valued at $500.

<HEAD>Fed Names Yamaichi As Primary Dealer In Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York handed a
victory to the Japanese securities industry Thursday by designating
a unit of Japan's Yamaichi Securities Co. as a primary dealer in
U.S. government securities.
   The decision was criticized as ``ill-timed and ill-advised'' by
Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., the author of recent legislation
that calls on the New York Fed to deny primary-dealer status to
institutions whose home countries deny equal access to U.S.
companies.
   The Schumer provision was included in the trade bill recently
signed by President Reagan.
   Yamaichi International (America) Inc. is the seventh unit of a
Japanese securities firm and the 45th institution in all to be
given the highly prized status of primary dealer. The others
include four British firms and one each from Canada, Hong Kong and
Australia.
   Primary dealers have the exclusive right to deal directly with
the New York Fed when it buys and sells government securities as
part of its duties in controlling the nation's money supply.
   Largely in reaction to pressure from the United States, the
Japanese Finance Ministry earlier this month announced steps to
open its own primary market in government bonds to foreign
institutions.
   In a prepared statement, Schumer said that since the pressure on
Japan was working, it was too soon to let up on it. An aide, Tom
Friedman, said that under the legislation, if the Treasury
Department determines after a year that Japan is not giving equal
treatment to U.S. firms, it could require the New York Fed to
revoke Yamaichi's primary-dealer status.

<HEAD>Settlement Reaches $32 Million In Milk Price-Fixing Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto TD1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida has recovered $32 million from
milk producers and distributors involved in a 10-year price-fixing
scheme that resulted in overcharges for nearly half the state's 67
school districts, Attorney General Bob Butterworth announced
Thursday.
   He said the total, reached with final agreements concluded
Wednesday, made it the largest antitrust recovery in state history
and a national record for a single-state antitrust case.
   ``Florida schools just won the lottery,'' said Butterworth.
   Wednesday's settlements included payments of $10.4 million by
Borden Inc. of Columbus, Ohio., $1.8 million by Kraft Inc.
(Sealtest) of Chicago, and $1.6 million by Flav-O-Rich Inc. of
Louisville, Ky. Those companies and others were charged Feb. 16 in
a civil lawsuit which Butterworth filed in U.S. District Court in
Miami.
   He charged that the companies had conspired to inflate prices of
milk sold to schools in 32 counties. Butterworth said that in no
case, however, was top management responsible. Instead, sales
people and distributors had colluded.
   Butterworth said Thursday that the settlement total of $32.23
million equals more than three times the total overcharges suffered
by the 32 school districts during four years of price fixing, plus
some legal fees. The lawsuit alleged that the scheme had occurred
over 10 years through 1987, but the suit was limited to four years
because of a federal statute of limitations.
   ``We hope the size of these recoveries will cause future vendors
to think twice before they sit in a room and conspire to impose
inflated prices on this state's taxpayers,'' said Butterworth.
   Previous settlements included Southland Corp. of Dallas, which
formerly operated Velda Dairy Farms of Miami, $9.66 million; Dean
Foods Co. of Chicago, which operates Hart's Dairy of Fort Myers,
T.G. Lee Foods Inc. of Orlando and McArthur Dairies Inc. of Miami,
$7.03 million; Pet Inc. of St. Louis, $1.7 million.
   The settlements also cover four Florida distributors named as
defendants: Pierson Distributors Inc. of Opa-Locka, H&T
Distributors Inc. of Homestead; and Butler Foods of Naples., all
part of the Borden settlement; and Marshall Simmons Enterprise of
Mango, part of the Dean settlement.
   Most of the money will be redistributed to the 32 school
districts in the next two years, said Butterworth, adding that
criminal investigations were proceeding in the case and further
civil action is possible.
   ``The recoveries represent as much as the state could have hoped
for had we gone to trial and prevailed,'' he said, adding that the
settlements came less than eight months after suit was filed and
without going to trial.
   The Florida counties affected by the price fixing are: Brevard,
Broward, Charlotte, Citrus, Collier, Dade, DeSoto, Flagler, Hardee,
Hendry, Hernando, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lake, Lee,
Manatee, Marion, Martin, Monroe, Okeechobee, Orange, Osceola, Palm
Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, St. Lucie, Sarasota, Seminole,
Sumter, Volusia.

<HEAD>Guardian Named For Grandchildren In Disputed $350 Million Ford
Trust</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead expected with details from Cristina Ford alimony
hearing; time uncertain; Also moved on general newswires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A snag in efforts to settle a
dispute over a $350 million trust left by auto magnate Henry Ford
II has been worked out with the appointment of a guardian to
represent his minor grandchildren.
   Attorneys for Kathleen DuRoss Ford, 48, widow of the Ford Motor
Co. heir, at first objected to another attorney's insistence of a
guardian, calling it a last-minute stall tactic.
   But they later agreed Tuesday to the appointment of retired Palm
Beach Circuit Judge Robert S. Hewitt, 71, as guardian of the four
minor grandchildren and any unborn grandchildren, residuary
beneficiaries of the trust.
   The minors will benefit after the death of Mrs. Ford, who is
entitled to receive a minimum of $1.5 million a year from the
trust, plus any income derived from investments.
   In another Ford family matter, a hearing was scheduled Wednesday
in Palm Beach County Circuit Court on a motion to dismiss Cristina
Ford's $5.4 million alimony claim. Ford divorced Cristina, his
second wife, in 1980, and she claims she has been cut off since his
death, not receiving any money from Ford's estate.
   Ford, who died Sept. 29, 1987, took control of Ford Motor Co. in
1945 from his grandfather, auto pioneer Henry Ford.
   Provisions of the confidential trust became public when Mrs.
Ford filed a lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust.
She and Ford's son, Edsel B. Ford II, had disagreed over whether
the trust should pay $1 million a year to William Donaldson, an old
friend of Henry Ford's and the third trustee, to manage the money.
   They also disagreed over which attorney would be counsel for the
trust and how the money should be invested.
   The trustees' 14 attorneys were in court Monday, ready to settle
the lawsuit and avoid the publicity a trial would generate.But the
agreement began to unravel when James Weber, attorney for Ford's
grandchildren, said a guardian was needed.
   Judge Vaughn Rudnick, who must approve any agreement, refused to
approve it without Weber's consent.

<HEAD>Fed Approves Mellon's `Bad Bank' Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mellon Bank Corp. said Thursday the Federal
Reserve Board approved its plan to create a so-called bad bank,
Grant Street National, into which it can dump $1 billion in
troubled loans.
   Mellon said it expects the Comptroller of the Currency to
shortly approve Grant Street National's charter, allowing
Pennsylvania's largest bank holding company and the nation's
15th-largest to insulate itself from the loans.
   ``We are pleased by the Federal Reserve's action today,'' Mellon
Vice Chairman W. Keith Smith said in a prepared statement. ``It
represents important progress toward completing the
recapitalization and asset disposition program announced in late
July.''
   Grant Street National will not take deposits. It will exist
solely to liquidate the loans, which Mellon will sell to the new
entity for a deeply discounted $575 million. Common shares in Grant
Street National will be distributed as a special dividend to
Mellon's common shareholders.
   With the bad loans segregated, Mellon's financial standing will
be improved. Bank officials said it was the first time that the
``good bank, bad bank'' tactic had been used by a relatively
healthy bank.
   Grant Street National will issue high-risk, high-yield junk
bonds while using the wholly-owned subsidiary Collection Services
Corp. to collect as much as possible on the loans.
   Mellon said it lost $844 million in 1987 because of soured loans
in the energy-dependent Southwest and in developing countries in
South America.

<HEAD>Report Blames Gas Compressor Explosion for Oil Rig Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An explosion in a North Sea oil rig's main gas
compressor apparently sparked an inferno that killed 167 people in
the world's worst oilfield disaster, an interim report of an
official technical inquiry indicated Thursday.
   The explosion probably ruptured pipelines carrying hydrocarbon
gases, setting off a series of explosions and fires that
incinerated the Piper Alpha rig owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp.
of Los Angeles, the report showed.
   The first explosions aboard Piper Alpha just before 10 p.m. July
6 seem to have severed electrical power and disabled control and
communications facilities, the report said.
   Three-quarters of the platform sank to the ocean floor 120 miles
off Scotland's eastern coast, trapping many of the victims. Two
would-be rescuers were among the dead.
   The British Department of Energy's director of safety, Jim
Petrie, who is heading the technical inquiry into the disaster,
announced that safety regulations for oil rig operators would be
tightened.
   Among areas that need closer attention are oil companies'
technical procedures for dealing with oilfield emergencies, and
their firefighting and evacuation systems, he said.
   The government recommended last month that additional safety
valves be installed on offshore oil and gas rigs to disconnect the
flow of fuel to work areas in the event of an explosion.
   Currently, there are no regulations concerning the locations of
valves, although all rigs have some type of valves.
   Most of the 120 men still missing are believed to have been
trapped in the sunken living quarters. Occidental said it hopes to
lift the accommodation modules to the surface early next month.
   A pre-hearing of a public inquiry will open Nov. 11 in Aberdeen,
Scotland, and the technical inquiry will carry on separately ``as
long as it's necessary to get to the facts,'' said a Department of
Energy spokesman. He declined to be identified by name, in keeping
with British practice.
   ``This is not the final report and much remains to be done,''
said Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson. ``A number of studies have
been commissioned and the results are yet to be received.
   ``Our priority has been to pass on any lessons as quickly as
possible and we will continue to do so,'' he told a news
conference. ``Safety has always been the first priority in the
North Sea.''

<HEAD>Coal Miners Union Announces Plans To Expand Outside Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTHA BRYSON HODEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers union, which
has represented the nation's coal miners since its formation in
1890, will expand its organizing efforts to workers outside the
coal industry, President Richard Trumka said Thursday.
   Trumka announced the plan as part of a new ``growth policy''
adopted during a meeting of the UMW's 24-member governing board,
held in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. The plan calls for ``a new
direction in organizing,'' the union said, ``which will emphasize
recruiting in both coal and non-coal areas.''
   The plan will ``transform the UMWA into the largest and most
comprehensive energy union in North America,'' according to a news
release from the UMW. The union has watched its membership dwindle
over the past 50 years from some 500,000 in the 1940s to around
110,000 active members today, about 80,000 of whom are employed.
   Earlier this year, the UMW was rebuffed in an attempt to merge
with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union. The UMW's
international executive board approved the merger, but it was
rejected by the OCAW's eight-member governing body. Trumka said the
merger would have created the nation's largest energy union.
   ``Coal miners, and all working Americans, are facing a far
different economic climate than our parents and grandparents, and
it has been obvious for quite some time that our union must change
to better deal with the realities of the day,'' Trumka said
Thursday.
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts, who is in charge of the
union's organizing, said the UMW's ``new approach will be to
concentrate resources in those areas which contain the largest
number of non-union miners and the highest tonnage of non-UMWA
coal.''
   ``In addition, we will expand our activities in non-coal areas,
including _ but not limited to _ other energy industries and
related manufacturing,'' Roberts said. He said the union's
governing board also had created a new ``associate membership''
that will be open to workers in companies where organizing drives
are in progress, as well as UMW supporters.
   The ``growth policy'' also includes the establishment of
standing committees that will examine the possibility of
reaffiliating with the AFL-CIO or merging with other unions. In its
1986 convention, the UMW gave Trumka and the rest of the governing
board the authority to merge or affiliate with other organizations.

   A federal safety investigation of the commuter
airline industry has uncovered management problems and, in nearly a
dozen cases, the falsification of maintenance and operational
records, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
   The agency said that one commuter airline voluntarily
surrendered its operating certificate after being inspected and
another may be forced to halt operations. Eight others air carriers
singled out for inspection gave up their certificates before the
inspections could begin, although in at least one case, the airline
denied its action was related to the probe.
   One airline that the FAA says gave up its commuter operating
certificate, South Pacific Island Airways, denied Thursday that it
had done so, and continues flying commuter service between American
Samoa and Western Samoa.
   The FAA investigation, which began last March, covered about 20
percent of the commuter airline industry. The agency is expected to
issue a report on its findings by December.
   FAA officials said Thursday that 35 commuter airlines were
singled out and inspected. One of the carriers, Air New Orleans,
voluntarily surrendered its commuter certificate after the
inspection, the agency said.
   Seven other airlines turned in their operating certificates as
commuter carriers voluntarily before the FAA inspections could get
under way, according top FAA spokesman Fred Farrar.
   The FAA identified the seven airlines as Arctic Circle Air,
AvAir, Dade Helicopter Jet, Exec Express, Texas National Air and
Grand Canyon Airlines as well as South Pacific Island Airways.
   However, the bankruptcy trustee for SPIA, Richard Kennedy, said
the airline did not surrender its part 135, or commuter, operating
certificate, although it did give up a different certificate for
longer-range flights a few months ago.
   Farrar maintained Thursday night that SPIA had given up the
commuter operating certificate.
   ``This whole thing that we're talking about has to do with 135
operations,'' Farrar said, adding, ``Part 121 (the certificate
Kennedy said SPIA had given up) is the operating rules that United
and the other larger airlines operate under.''
   As for SPIA's 135 certificate, Farrar said, ``That's the one
that my people tell me they gave up.''
   Kennedy said he checked with the FAA office in Honolulu and was
told SPIA still was allowed to operate in the Samoas.
   An FAA official in Honolulu did not immediately return phone
calls Thursday afternoon.
   As for Grand Canyon Airlines, a sightseeing aircraft belonging
to the airline collided with a helicopter over the Grand Canyon in
June 1986, killing 25 people. It was not immediately clear whether
Grand Canyon's surrender of its commuter certificate affects its
sightseeing operation.
   At least three of the carriers _ AvAir, Dade Helicopter Jet and
SPIA _ already had been under Chapter ll bankruptcy proceedings,
according to the FAA.
   Glenn Schaab, president of AvAir, said in a telephone interview
from Raleigh, N.C., that AvAir surrendered its certificate to the
FAA in June, but he said the action had ``absolutely nothing'' to
do with the impending FAA inspection of the airline.
   ``We had sold the flight operations portion of the company ...
and didn't need the certificate anymore,'' Schaab said.
   None of the other airlines subject to the inspections was
identified.
   FAA officials said that as many as 200 enforcement actions may
come out of the inspections of the 35 airlines and that one of the
carriers may yet be forced to surrender its license.
   John S. Kern, acting deputy associate administrator for
regulations and certification, told a House investigations
subcommittee Wednesday that in some cases, irregularities were
immediately corrected by the airlines ``and in some instances
enforcement actions have been initiated.''
   There have been at least 11 cases where records were found to
have been falsified, said Farrar.
   The special probe of the commuter airlines was announced last
March by FAA Administrator Allan McArtor after an unusually high
number of commuter accidents in late 1987 and early l988.
   Seven commuter accidents over a four-month period from November
1987 through February 1988 resulted in 56 fatalities and raised the
concern of the National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA.
The commuters had their safest year ever in 1986 when there were
only two fatal accidents and four deaths.
   Commuters airlines, which normally fly aircraft of 30 seats or
fewer, have taken on an increasingly important role in air travel
since many of the larger airlines no longer fly into small
communities. The commuters carried more than 30 million passengers
last year compared with 14 million in 1979 and are expected to
carry more than 60 million people by the end of this century.
   Kern provided no details in his testimony as to the infractions
found at the commuter airlines, but described the findings in broad
terms, saying a detailed report was expected to be available by
December.
   The inspections focused on management, maintenance, quality
control procedures and record keeping because preliminary studies
indicated those to be likely problem areas, Kern said.

   U S West Inc. has acquired a 10 percent
stake in the French cable television company, Lyonnaise
Communications, U S West announced Wednesday.
   The agreement completes negotiations started in April when a
preliminary agreement was signed, according to a news release.
Shares in the company were transferred earlier this month in Paris.
   ``This will leverage and enhance U S West's skills through an
active role and position us in related European communications
businesses,'' said U S West International President Reynie Ortiz.
   Lyonnaise Communications, a subsidiary of Lyonnaise des Eaux,
maintains equity positions in a variety of cable companies,
including Paris Cable, Home Shopping Service and Channel J-Youth
Channel.
   Lyonnaise Communications networks cover eight of the 20 Paris
districts supported by Paris TV Cable, which carries 17 channels.
Networks operate in Neuilly, Boulogne-Billancourt, Levallois,
Saint-Germain en Laye, Cannes and Epinal.
   Lyonnaise Communications officials say they plan to expand the
cable network to 13 urban areas representing a viewership of 4
million.
   U S West, based in Englewood, also owns U S West Communications
and other units involved in directory publishing, marketing
services, commercial real estate, cellular mobile communications,
and paging, software, and business communications products and
services.
