   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said
Wednesday he expects Congress to pass drought-assistance
legislation by mid-August, but farmers shouldn't expect any help
until at least October.
   ``I think there will probably be some farmers hanging on the
edge that may have a terrible time staying in business,'' Lyng
said. ``I hope it will not be a large number.''
   Lyng spoke at a news conference held on one of the farms he
toured as part of a three-day, 10-state sweep through areas hard
hit by the drought of '88.
   After stops in Iowa and Missouri, Lyng toured farms in North and
South Dakota, saying the two states seemed even harder hit than the
Corn Belt.
   ``Wherever we've gone, the effects of the drought are very
apparent. But I must say in the Dakotas, the problem seems much
worse,'' Lyng said as he toured wheat and barley fields on the farm
of Ed and Paul Schlosser near Spiritwood, N.D., 110 miles east of
Bismarck.
   Hours later, Lyng arrived for the night in central Minnesota
inspected a cornfield, and said the damage there was the worst he
has seen in the eight states he had visited.
   ``We've seen other corn that is hurting, but I don't think it
was quite as bad as it is here,'' Lyng told Edgar Traut, whose
family owns and operates a 320-acre dairy farm in St. Cloud.
Traut's son Dennis, 29, said his 170-acre corn crop, which is only
waist-high, was of doubtful value even for silage.
   ``You can't come to a farm like this without having some
emotional impact,'' he said. ``You have to worry about the families
that are affected.''
   Lyng was scheduled Thursday to travel on to Wisconisn and
Michigan.
   The promise of federal aid did little to encourage one farmer.
   ``There's not much you can do. He can't make it rain,'' said Joe
Cerveny who farms 160 acres of corn and soybeans south of Cedar
Rapids. ``I'm 72 years old and I've never seen it like this.''
   Lyng looked at a corn crop on Kenneth Bontty's eastern Iowa farm
and said it was among the hardest hit by the lack of moisture.
   ``It's some of the worst corn we've seen in terms of potential
yield,'' Lyng said. ``Perhaps the government can come through with
drought assistance, but it doesn't help the corn now.''
   ``It is a terrible loss. It really is,'' Lyng said.
   Some farmers said teasing rains in the past few weeks had
skipped the driest parts of Iowa.
   ``We've had rain one or two times a week, but it's just been too
spotty,'' said Stuart Towe, who farms 550 acres.
   Lyng toured farms in Missouri earlier Wednesday and said the
nation's crops will probably suffer severe damage despite recent
rain.
   ``There is a lot of damage and loss,'' he said. ``In a lot of
fields there is grave doubt that there will be any harvest.''
   Lyng said it was too early to estimate the dollar loss caused by
the drought. However, he said he and a task force will discuss
their findings after returning to Washington, D.C., later this
week. He said he will report Monday to President Reagan.
   Lyng continued to resist pleas to allow livestock to graze on
federal Conservation Reserve Program land, despite renewed requests
from Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. He also renewed his promise that no
embargoes on grain would be enforced as a result of the drought.
   Lyng began his tour Tuesday with stops in Ohio, Indiana and
Tennessee.

   The exile Nicaraguan
resistance movement ended a three-day meeting Tuesday with the
Contra military leader well-placed to influence its political
policies and relations with Washington.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, 56, a former colonel in the late
President Anastasio Somoza's army, was elected by a 44-2 vote
Monday night to the seven-member directorate that oversees the
U.S.-backed insurgency against the leftist Sandinista government.
   Late Tuesday, a small homemade bomb exploded outside the hotel
where the Nicaraguan resistance met, police said. No one was
injured in the blast, which occurred about nine hours after the
meeting ended.
   Police Maj. Bueno Jiminian said no one had claimed
responsibility for the bombing. Police would not speculate on who
set off the bomb.
   Bermudez's position was further enhanced by the re-election of
his closest ally on the directorate, Aristedes Sanchez, and of
Alfredo Cesar, who spoke strongly in favor of his candidacy.
   Newly elected director Wilfredo Montalvan also was seen as a
Bermudez supporter, but the allegiances of Roberto Ferrey and
Wycliffe Diego were less clear. Ferrey replaces his sister,
Azucena, who decided not to seek re-election, and Diego fills a
vacant seat representing Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast Indians and
Creoles.
   Bermudez won a second vacant seat.
   Adolfo Calero, 56, who as the directorate's senior member had
been regarded as its political head, also was re-elected. He is a
rival of Bermudez.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Calero dismissed suggestions that
the colonel's election would lessen chances that the U.S. Congress
will resume military aid to the Contras.
   ``We elected a directorate to manage the organization,'' Calero
said. ``We didn't elect people to appeal for the aid.''
   Congress cut off military aid to the Contras in February. But
the Sandinista government's recent crackdown on political
opposition in Nicaragua has given the Contras new hope that the
United States will resume the flow of weapons and ammunition.
   In Juigalpa, Nicaragua on Tuesday, the ninth anniversary of the
Sandinistas in power, President Daniel Ortega said government
leaders ``are socialists and there's socialism in Nicaragua since
1979.''
   Both Bermudez and Calero said Bermudez, a professional soldier,
would confine himself to military matters, acting as a
quasi-defense secretary on the previously all-civilian political
directorate.
   But Bermudez skirted questions about whether he would relinquish
his military command of the 17,000 rebel troops, saying only that
the directorate had not yet considered the matter.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who was ousted from the directorate by
Montalvan, said he thought Bermudez was determined to take absolute
control of the resistance movement.
   ``I don't think he has total control, but that his clearly his
intention,'' said Chamorro, a 36-year-old former Nicaraguan
journalist.
   A Reagan administration official, who was at the conference as
an observer, said Washington would not object to Bermudez' election
to the directorate, which sets overall policy for the resistance
movement.
   ``It's not Enrique Bermudez as one man equals the directorate;
the ultimate decisions rests with all seven directors,'' said the
official on condition of anonymity.
   The resistance movement has been split by feuding between
Bermudez supporters and dissidents, who accuse him of being too
close to former backers of Somoza.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance Assembly is composed of exile
representatives of political parties and labor, business and ethnic
groups in Nicaragua.
   In April, Calero and Chamorro sided with dissidents who tried
but failed to strip Bermudez of his military command after he fired
six commanders in Honduras for mutiny.
   Bermudez said he sought a position on the directorate to regroup
and unify the movement and give a political voice to the rebel
forces in the field. He denied having any ambition for control of
the movement and insisted he would confine himself to military
matters.
   He said said he is willing to resume negotiations for peace if
the Sandinistas live up to promises to institute democratic reforms
in Nicaragua.

   Young people, dream of a new value system. Dream of teachers,

of doctors, but doctors who are more concerned with public health

concerned with justice than a judgeship. Dream of artists, but
artists who will convey music and message, rhythm, and reason.
   Dream of priests and preachers, but priests and preachers who

will mold public opinion against a headwind, not just ride the
tailwinds of opinion polls. Dream of a world where we measure
character by how much we share and care, not by how much we take
and consume.
   America must never surrender to a high moral challenge.
   America must never surrender to drugs. No first use is our
policy; clinics for those who are sick. Not free needles and
cynicism. Never surrender, go forward.
   America must never surrender to malnutrition. We can feed the
hungry and clothe the poor. We will never surrender, we will go
forward.
   America must never surrender to illiteracy. We will invest in
our children. Never surrender, go forward.
   America must never surrender to inequality. Women deserve
comparable and pay equity. Women make 60 cents of every dollar a
man makes. Yet they can't buy bread cheaper, they can't buy homes
cheaper. Women deserve comparable worth and pay equity.
   Our nation will never surrender to AIDS. People with AIDS
deserve our compassion, but they deserve more than that. They
deserve resources for research, expedited approval of drugs, a
coordinated offensive to stop AIDS now.
   Those in your wheelchairs, don't surrender. I know that people
look down upon you. They try to break your spirit. But stay tall in
your chairs. You are measured by the size of your character, not
the height of your reach. Remember when this nation was down, we
turned to Franklin Roosevelt, who could not stand on his legs, to
put the nation back on its feet. I tell you this _ I would rather
have Roosevelt in a wheelchair than Reagan on a horse.
   Never surrender, move forward.
   My work to keep America strong and make America better is
ancient and endless.
   We can win. When I stand here tonight, it has a meaning for
those who are down, those who are tired or bent. Don't give up.
Hold on, for the morning comes. You can make it if you try. Hold
on, the morning comes. How do I know?

<HEAD>Priest Calls on Haitians To Continue Fighting State Terrorism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A Roman Catholic priest on Tuesday
called on Haitians gathered to honor a slain human rights leader to
keep fighting against state terrorism.
   ``Lafontant (Joseph) has left, but he has not passed away,''
Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide told about 1,000 people gathered at
St. Jean Bosco church for a memorial Mass.
   Joseph, 54, a lawyer and political militant, was found beaten
and stabbed to death in his car July 11, police said.
   Human rights leaders called the murder an effort to silence
opposition to the military government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who
ousted President Leslie Manigat June 19 and suspended the
Constitution.
   The Ministry of Justice said the killing was ``a serious blow to
the democratic process'' and that the murderers would be sought and
tried according to the law.
   ``A whole generation ... has indigestion from the corruption the
army has sown,'' said Aristide, a popular priest who heads the
radical wing of Haiti's Roman Catholic Church. ``We must remain
faithful to those who were faithful to ... the struggle against
macoutism.''
   The word macoutism is synonymous with state-backed crime and
violence.
   No one has been brought to trial for the 1987 murders of
political leaders Louis-Eugene Athis and Yves Volel. They were
killed when Namphy was head of a provisional junta that governed
Haiti for two years after the flight of former President
Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986.
   Joseph was buried Saturday morning in Port-au-Prince Cemetery
before about 200 relatives and friends.
   In 1978, Joseph helped found the Haitian League for Human
Rights. In 1986, he founded the Center for the Promotion of Human
Rights, which he directed until his death.

   Big Red, a show horse whose movie credits
included ``Little Big Man'' and ``The Missouri Breaks,'' was shot
in his stable by an unknown assailant, the horse's owner said.
   Owner Earl Rosell said the horse was shot in the left shoulder
while it was in a barn behind his house last Friday. The horse,
suffering shattered bones in its shoulder, went into shock and was
put to sleep, Rosell said.
   The 33-year-old horse was featured in films including ``Little
Big Man,'' ``The Missouri Breaks,'' and the television movie, ``The
Legend of Walks Far Woman.''
   He also performed in commercials and participated in jumping
competitions. In Billings, he pulled Santa's sleigh at Christmas,
making visits to children in hospitals and other groups.
   Rosell said he doesn't understand why someone would have wanted
to shoot the horse.
   ``I don't think I have any enemies, and if I do, I don't think
they'd be bad enough to kill my horse,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union's first automotive export to the
United States will be a heavy-duty dump truck used in mining, and
could be shipped to customers within three months, a Soviet export
official said.
   Boris Hubaev, first deputy general director of Avtoexport, the
Soviet Union's export agency, said Tuesday he will negotiate for
two days later this week in New York with Global Technology Group,
a U.S. company that will help find a distributor for the product
and set up a parts and service network.
   Global Technology Group deals with various types of exported
consumer goods, and the Soviets hope to find a distributor for
their trucks ``as soon as possible,'' Hubaev said.
   The U.S.S.R. produces about 2,500 of the specialized heavy-duty
trucks a year, Hubaev said. The vehicles already are sold in Peru.
   Hubaev said Avtoexport would consider pricing its trucks
somewhat lower than other vehicles in the U.S. heavy-duty truck
market, which accounts for about 140,000 vehicle sales a year. He
said the Soviet Union produces heavy-duty trucks capable of
carrying loads up to 180 tons.
   The Soviet Union, however, has no plans to expand its annual
production of about 900,000 trucks, including buses, Hubaev said.
He said the Soviets are aiming to double passenger car production
within the next six to seven years.
   Hubaev was scheduled today to address the Automotive News World
Congress, a trade journal-sponsored gathering of auto industry
executives, suppliers and analysts.

   Police Officer Rick Flynn says he's not
happy about having to make patrols in a dump truck.
   The only police car in this central Pennsylvania community of
about 3,500 broke down this week and officials were concerned about
possible insurance problems if officers used their own cars. So
officials gave police the borough's dump truck.
   ``People who see me in the dump truck think it's funny,'' Flynn
said. ``I think it's funny, unless I'm driving it. That thing
bounces a lot.''
   Flynn said the police car was to be repaired today.

   A tanker truck sliced through a car
carrying nine family members Tuesday, killing seven people and
critically injuring three others, police said.
   The collision ruptured the truck's 5,000-gallon tank, spilling
an unidentified substance onto the roadway and forcing residents
within a half-mile of the accident scene to leave their homes for
nearly four hours.
   The wreck took the lives of a 35-year-old New Ellenton man and
six of his relatives ranging in age from 3 to 18. Three other
people, including the truck driver, were listed in critical
condition at the Medical College of Georgia Hospital in nearby
Augusta late Tuesday.
   ``This is the worst I've experienced,'' said Aiken County
Coroner Sue Townsend.
   Details of the accident were still sketchy, but bystanders said
the car had just pulled onto highway U.S. 278 south of New Ellenton
about 4 p.m. and appeared to be turning around in the road when the
truck hit it. The truck sliced through the vehicle, and the impact
of the collision tore loose a set of wheels from the truck, police
said.
   Fire Chief Melvin Flippen said officials could not identify the
chemical spilled during the acacident, but treated it as if it were
toxic. The area covered by the evacuation order is sparsely
populated.
   One firefighter was treated for heat exhaustion and released.
   The dead were identified as Eddie Harrison Jr., 35; his nieces,
Monica Renee Harrison, 18, and Venessa Nicole Williamson, 6; his
son Evon, 15; daughters Azarene, 8, and Angel, 7; and his grandson,
Jamal Harrison, 3.

<HEAD>Report Parties Approve Agreement on Southwestern Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governments of Angola, South Africa and Cuba
have approved an agreement in principle for the withdrawal of
foreign troops from Angola and majority rule in Namibia, according
to a published report.
   The New York Times, citing unidentified foreign diplomats and
American officials, reported in its Wednesday editions that the
three countries had informed the United States of their acceptance
of the principles. The Reagan administration planned to announce
the development on Wednesday, the newspaper said.
   The ``statement of principles'' was initialed by Cuban, Angolan
and South African negotiators last Wednesday at talks held in New
York and mediated by Chester Crocker, U.S. undersecretary of state
for African affairs.
   The statement called for Cuban troops to leave the Marxist-ruled
southern African nation of Angola and for South Africa to end its
73-year rule over Namibia, but did not set a timetable, Crocker
said. The text of the statement was not made public.
   The principles required the approval of the three governments,
after which military and political experts from those nations would
meet in August to work out details for a settlement.
   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for the independence of South-West Africa,
commonly called Namibia, when the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops
withdraw from neighboring Angola.
   The United States was a party to the talks because it has been
supporting anti-communist rebels in Angola with funds and weapons
since 1985. Angola has been fighting a civil war since it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975, battling anti-communist rebels
in the south who call themselves UNITA, for National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola.
   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops from Namibia into Angola
to support UNITA forces in the fighting.
   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the
same time span that U.N. Resolution 435 sets for granting
independence to Namibia. Angola and Cuba had insisted that Cuban
withdrawal take place over four years.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I under a League
of Nations mandate to administer the territory. The League's
successor, the United Nations, revoked that mandate.
   The four parties began their meetings in London last May.

   China has set up a new state bureau to oversee
efforts to reduce the number of shoddy, substandard goods on the
market and make Chinese products more competitive on world markets,
an official daily said today.
   In announcing creation of the State Bureau of Technical
Supervision, State Councillor Song Jian said substandard products
remain a serious problem, the China Daily said.
   It said a spot check of industrial products earlier this year
found that only 20 percent fully satisfied national standards.
   The paper said the new bureau will strengthen supervision over
technology and establish an authoritative system of standardization
and measurement.
   Song was quoted as saying Tuesday said that since China
initiated its economic reforms and open-door policy in 1979, it has
put into effect more than 11,000 state standards and 500
measurement regulations.

<TEXT>
   Over the past two weeks, Washington has been
sending two strong messages to Asia: the United States is not a
declining economic power and it has no intention of pulling its
forces from the eastern Pacific rim.
   The messenger is George P. Shultz, making his last and longest
trip to Asia since becoming U.S. secretary of state in 1982.
   Starting July 6, Shultz visited Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Japan. By and
large, it was a successful farewell.
   Addressing nations whose economic well-being would be
jeopardized if America goes into a downward spin, Shultz maintained
that despite the world's largest trade deficit, the United States
enjoys a ``stronger economy today than ever before in its history.''
   Despite recent anti-American demonstrations in South Korea and
the Philippines, virtually all the region's leaders reportedly told
Shultz they want a substantial U.S. presence in Asia _ military,
economic and political.
   If any anxiety was expressed it was over perceived American
political wavering, growing protectionism and isolationist trends
that Asian leaders fear could leave the Asian field fallow for the
Soviet Union _ and eventually for China and Japan, said U.S.
officials who took part in the talks.
   ``That was the message (to us) all over. The United States has
great responsibilities and you have to assume those
responsibilities,'' Gaston Sigur, the department's top Asian
official, said in an interview. ``Nobody is asking us to come out
here to be dictators, but you have to be involved and I don't see
any intention on our part not to be involved.''
   In the Philippines, Shultz' talks with President Corazon Aquino,
who has become a personal friend, and with other leaders apparently
helped hurdle problems in assessing U.S. naval and air bases in
that country.
   Manila is pressing for more than the $180 million a year the
U.S. now pays for the bases. Shultz appeared willing to make some
compromises, but has refused to regard the compensation merely as
rent due an ally.
   The treaty covering America's largest bases outside its mainland
is up for renewal in 1991. Shultz stressed that the United States
would relocate the facilities elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific area if
the anti-base movement succeeds.
   In South Korea, he pledged America's 42,000 troops will help
ward off any attack if North Korea opts to disrupt the Olympic
Games in Seoul. And U.S. officials expressed satisfaction that
security arrangements with Japan, where 60,000 American troops are
stationed, remain solid.
   ``America's resolve to help our Korean ally ... repel aggression
from the North is as firm now as when we signed our mutual defense
treaty in 1953,'' Shultz said in a speech in Seoul. Radicals have
been demanding that all American forces leave the divided peninsula.
   Sigur, the department's assistant secretary for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, said Manila and Seoul were not moving away from
security ties with the United States but toward redefining how
close they should be.
   ``They want to have more of a say in defining it. That's fine,''
Sigur said. ``It may cause us a bit of heartburn here and there but
it's a good, healthy attitude.''
   China and non-Communist Southeast Asian nations, Sigur said,
similarly signaled their desire for a U.S. counterbalance, given
unsettled Chinese-Soviet relations, the conflict in Cambodia and a
potential threat from the big Soviet military base at Cam Ranh Bay
in Vietnam.
   In Beijing, Shultz acknowledged that he was unable to dissuade
Chinese leaders from selling ballistic missiles in the Middle East.
But he emphasized that the two countries have forged mature
relations across a broad spectrum, and the Chinese agreed.
   The two sides appeared to reach broad agreement on a political
settlement in Cambodia, although it remains unclear how China will
deal with the Khmer Rouge, whom they currently supply with weapons.
   Shultz called for the withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from
Cambodia, voiced strong support for Cambodian resistance leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and expressed American abhorrence of the
Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge, now in a three-party rebel alliance, killed
millions of Cambodians during its rule from 1975 until the
Vietnamese invaded in 1978.
   On almost every stop, Shultz, a former economics professor,
lauded free trade and linked economic successes in Asia to the
unhindered flow of goods and ideas.
   In a rare moment of public combativeness, Shultz lashed out at
South Korea for keeping its doors shut to American exports.
   ``If my statement causes anti-Americanism, so be it,'' he said.
   Shultz cited a host of statistics to show how tightly the
American and Asian economies are enmeshed.
   The United States, for example, is market for more than 50
percent of manufactured exports from non-communist Southeast Asia.
Exports to the United States have fueled South Korea's dramatic
growth and helped to sustain Japan's at a combined cost to the U.S.
of about $70 billion in trade deficits.
   But while this reliance on the American market has reaped big
rewards for Asia, it has also spawned anxiety. Asian leaders
attacked pending U.S. legislation that would restrict imports, and
free-trader Shultz shared their displeasure.

<HEAD>Government Orders Payoff For Bettors Bilked By Racetrack Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day at the races became an affair of state in
France when the government ordered a betting concern to pay about
$10 million to gamblers bilked of their winnings when a track's
tote board flashed the wrong numbers.
   The office of Premier Michel Rocard said people who had bet on
the right horse at the Maisons-Laffitte track's Prix de Strasbourg
on Sunday but went away empty-handed would collect after all. Those
who collected winnings based on the miscall can also keep their
money.
   The announcement came after a meeting Tuesday between
representatives of the Budget and Agricultural Ministries and
racetrack officials.
   ``Following the error in the announcing of the Prix de
Strasbourg results ... the state considers that measures must be
taken in favor of bettors who were victims of this situation,'' the
premier's office said in a statement.
   The real winning numbers of Sunday's race were 14-8-5-11, but a
judge who scrutinized a photo finish inadvertently called out
14-8-11-5 and it was those numbers that went up on the tote board.
   The error was recognized shortly afterward, but too late to make
reparations. According to the racing code, winning tickets are
those which match the numbers on the tote board, right or wrong.
   Officials estimated that the state-run betting concern will have
to pay out about $10 million to rectify the error. But some race
track habitues interviewed on the evening news are already
groaning, saying they, and many like them, had thrown out their
winning tickets.
   Bettors who won with the wrong numbers collected about $360 each.

<HEAD>Lawyers Analyze McKay's Treatment of Meese</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor decides he won't seek an
indictment, but tells the world that the subject of his
investigation _ Attorney General Edwin Meese III _ probably broke
the law.
   Why wasn't Meese charged with a crime, and was it unfair of
independent counsel James McKay to announce that the attorney
general likely violated two criminal tax statutes and, on two
occasions, a federal conflict-of-interest provision?
   ``If this happened in a routine case, if (U.S. Attorney) Rudy
Giuliani said, `I've been investigating ABC brokerage house and
I've concluded they violated the law and I could probably convince
a jury, but I'm not going to indict,' that's not a proper use of
prosecutorial power,'' said Stephen Gillers, a New York University
law professor and ethics expert.
   In that context, ``there's something to Meese's argument'' that
McKay treated him unfairly, Gillers said. ``But I think McKay and
Meese are a different animal. McKay has an obligation to explain
the reasons for his actions. The attorney general gets extra
scrutiny and that comes with the territory.''
   Others, particularly conservatives, disagree.
   ``What McKay has done is turn the office of independent counsel
into an engine to destroy reputations without any judicial trial,''
said Bruce Fein, an associate deputy attorney general in 1981-82
and formerly with the conservative Heritage Foundation. ``It's an
absolute disgrace and blatantly unconstitutional. Civil
libertarians should be denouncing this.''
   Meese said he was outraged and appalled by McKay's finding that
he probably broke the law.
   ``It's profoundly ironic that the attorney general is attacking
the integrity of Mr. McKay for exercising some discretion in his
(Meese's) favor'' by not prosecuting, said Louis Seidman, a
professor of law at Georgetown University. ``It seems to me that
the existence of the special prosecutor law (the 1978 Ethics in
Government Act) has allowed the exercise of prosecutorial
discretion. If Meese had been cleared by a subordinate in the
Justice Department, there would be a major scandal.''
   The law setting up the independent counsel process ``allows him
to give Meese a break which he may well deserve,'' Seidman said.
   As to why Meese wasn't prosecuted on tax violations, guidelines
in the Justice Department's tax division and the Internal Revenue
Service spell out terms under which prosecution of cases may be
authorized, noted Gerald Feffer, a criminal tax lawyer with
Williams & Connolly who, as a deputy assistant attorney general
from 1979 to 1981, oversaw criminal tax cases in the Justice
Department.
   The relatively small amount of tax Meese owed, $3,479, and the
fact that Meese's tax problems stemmed from a single instance _
rather than a pattern of failing to report capital gains _ point
against prosecution.
   In addition, McKay found evidence that Meese had intended to
file an amended return, and in fact Meese did so in February,
albeit nearly a year and a half late and in the midst of a criminal
investigation.
   ``In the tax area, unlike any other area, there is a national
review process that goes forward to provide uniformity and to
examine each case with structured standards of prosecution,'' said
Feffer, who says prosecution would not have been instituted in
similar circumstances against a less prominent taxpayer.
   McKay's report found that Meese probably twice violated the
conflict-of-interest law by participating as attorney general in
matters affecting the telecommunications industry while he was
holding regional Bell telephone stock.
   Instead of selling his phone holdings as he had promised the
Senate and Office of Government Ethics, Meese, unable to find the
certificates, signed an agreement transferring the stock to his
investment manager. He then met with regional Bell executives and
supported legislation sought by many in the industry while
continuing to receive stock dividend checks, which he didn't cash.
Just before making a decision favorable to the regional Bell
companies, Meese obtained a White House waiver allowing him to
participate in the matter despite his holdings.
   The conflict-of-interest law prohibits personal and substantial
participation by an official in a particular matter in which, to
his knowledge, he or his spouse has a financial interest.
   McKay decided not to prosecute after concluding there was no
evidence Meese acted from motivation for personal gain. McKay
pointed out the attorney general took steps, though ineffective
ones, to divest himself of the stock.
   The conflict-of-interest law ``is a tough statute,'' said Robert
Luskin, a private Washington attorney who was special counsel to
the organized crime section of the Justice Department from 1980 to
1982. ``If the question was: Did a guy lie to somebody? you don't
have much trouble on a statute like that. But I sort of defy
anybody reading the conflict-of-interest provisions in close cases
to say which side of the line conduct falls.''
   Kenneth S. Geller, a former deputy solicitor general and member
of the Watergate prosecution team, said, ``public officials should
be held to a higher standard, but it would be wrong, I believe, to
hold them to a standard of absolute liability. There still has to
be some discretion exercised on whether or not to bring criminal
charges.''

   Police arrested 134 hymn-singing abortion
opponents blocking a medical clinic Tuesday, while at the official
convention protest site a mock trial convicted House Speaker Jim
Wright of ethics violations.
   As temperatures climbed above 90 once again, demonstrators of
every stripe took to the streets to bid for attention from
delegates and reporters on the second day of the Democratic
National Convention.
   Other groups that took their turn on the stage of a two-acre
parking lot near The Omni convention site included the American
Indian Movement, protesting the treatment of native Americans, and
No Business as Usual, which denounced the ``Star Wars'' defense
plan as a step toward World War III. The stage and equipment were
provided by the city, which has scheduled protests throughout the
convention at two-hour intervals.
   Twelve other protesters were arrested at various sites around
the city, according to convention security spokeswoman Myrna May.
She said four were spray-painting anti-war slogans on a government
building, four were blocking a sidewalk near the Carter
Presidential Center and four were obstructing police at a building.
   The day began with mass arrests three miles north of the
convention zone outside the Atlanta SurgiCenter, a medical clinic
which performs abortions and other outpatient surgery. Abortion
opponents singing hymns sat or lay across the steps and in front of
the door, blocking access to the plain brick building.
   Police moved in at about 7 a.m., arresting 134 protesters, at
the request of the clinic.
   ``We did not have any kinds of abuse. They simply would not
move,'' said Police Maj. Ken Burnette.
   The protesters, part of a group called Operation Rescue Atlanta,
did not interfere with any patients, said a clinic employee who
declined to be identified: ``It's so early in the morning that we
really did not have patients scheduled.''
   Charges included criminal trespassing, unlawful assembly and
interfering with a police officer, Burnette said. Those arrested
were taken to the city's Lakewood Fairgrounds, where buildings are
equipped to house and process people arrested during the convention.
   Two Municipal Court judges processed the protesters at a
warehouse on the fairgrounds and set bond at $500 to $600 for each.
   Nine who gave police their names were allowed to post bond, but
the remaining 125 were taken to the city correction center because
they would only identify themselves as ``Baby Jane Doe'' or ``Baby
John Doe.''
   Meanwhile, a group called Public Advocates of the U.S. staged a
``trial'' of Wright complete with a ``judge'' in black robes. The
mock court found Wright guilty of ethics violations before a small
``jury'' of early-morning onlookers.
   Wright, the convention chairman, is under investigation by the
House Ethics Committee because of allegations that he made unduly
large royalties on a book he wrote. The book was printed by a
longtime campaign contractor for the Texas congressman and edited
by a member of Wright's congressional staff.
   Also under investigation are charges that Wright improperly
intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Texas businesses.
   Outside the Carter Presidential Center, four anti-war protesters
were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct-impeding traffic and
taken to the city jail, said Jackie Barrett, spokeswoman for the
DNC Command Center.
   And at a downtown hotel, police scuffled with demonstrators
supporting Tawana Brawley after New York Democratic officials
refused to let them into a meeting of the state's delegation. There
were no apparent injuries no arrests.
   Miss Brawley, a black 16-year-old, has alleged that she was
attacked by six white men last November in Dutchess County, N.Y.,
one of whom flashed a badge like a police officer's. Her advisers
have persuaded her not to cooperate with a special state
investigation of the incident being conducted by state officials,
who they insist are racists bent on covering up the truth.
   Red Cross volunteers were on duty again Tuesday, giving out cold
water to overheated demonstrators, onlookers and journalists, and
assisting those suffering in the heat _ estimated to be even higher
in the blacktop parking lot than elsewhere.
   On Monday, between 40 and 50 people were treated for heat
exhaustion, said Bill Saye, captain of the Red Cross team. They
included a half-dozen members of the Guardian Angels anti-crime
group, who ``dropped like flies'' while standing at parade rest,
Saye said.
   ``I told them to get some liquids in them, but they wouldn't
listen,'' he said, adding that two of the Angels, both from
Chicago, were taken to a hospital with severe heat exhaustion.
   Also on hand Tuesday afternoon in the demonstration area were
advocates for the mothers of Atlanta's ``missing and murdered
children,'' slain during 1979-81. Wayne B. Williams was convicted
of two of the killings, and subsequently blamed for 22 more _
although he was never charged in those cases. The demonstrators are
seeking legal help for the mothers who still wonder who really
killed their children, said spokeswoman Betty Youmans.
   Elsewhere, a Business Roundtable reception for Sens. Bob Graham
of Florida and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia was canceled when
members of the Service Employees International Union set up an
informational picket line outside the Marriott Marquis Hotel. The
union represents janitors at the hotel who are in the midst of a
labor dispute with the hotel's owner, Atlanta architect-developer
John Portman Jr.

<HEAD>Unisys Drops Defense Consultants; Grand Jury Begins Pentagon Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Pentagon contractor is firing all its
defense consultants and shaking up management of one division based
on an internal investigation separate from the massive government
bribery inquiry now being presented to a federal grand jury.
   The federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., heads into its second
day of closed-door testimony today, with a chief prosecutor
promising ``there won't be any luminaries'' testifying soon.
   Meanwhile, Unisys Corp., the giant computer company based in
Blue Bell, Pa., announced that an internal investigation of its
defense consultants by former Watergate special prosecutor Henry
Ruth had uncovered possibly unethical activity in one division.
   Unisys Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal said the company began the
Ruth investigation last fall without knowledge of the nearly
2-year-old federal investigation, which was first revealed by
coordinated FBI searches on June 14.
   No one has been charged in the investigation of the
$150-billion-a-year Pentagon purchasing system. But government
documents allege that some defense contractors and consultants
bribed Pentagon officials for contracting details vital to winning
contracts worth billions of dollars.
   At Unisys, Blumenthal placed a Long Island, N.Y., division under
new management, put some employees on administrative leave and
terminated ``all consulting contracts with those who represented
the compkn~ before the federal government on defense-related
matters.''
   A Unisys plant on Long Island was searched by federal agents
June 14, as were the offices or homes of several Unisys employees
and consultants. Unisys was formed by the $4.8 billion 1986 merger
of Sperry and Burroughs.
   In Alexandria, an attorney for defense consultant and former
Navy official Melvyn Paisley filed motions Tuesday to quash 11
subpoenas from the grand jury and to be advised if the government
conducted any illegal electronic surveillance of his client.
   In all, 275 subpoenas, mostly for documents and records, were to
be answered in Alexandria on Tuesday. Sharon Dibbley, spokeswoman
for U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson, said the government had arranged a
location, which she would not identify, where those under subpoena
could deliver records without being observed by reporters.
   Many of the subpoenas are to people who are only potential
witnesses, not targets of the investigation.
   Ms. Dibbley had no comment on the Paisley motion and knew of no
objections filed to the other subpoenas.
   The only recognizable figure arriving for Tuesday's session of
the grand jury in the U.S. Courthouse was Jack A. Sherman, a
civilian Marine Corps employee whose office was searched by federal
agents June 14.
   Sherman, who sources said was transferred to non-procurement
duties pending the outcome of the investigation, was a supervisory
contracts negotiator for the Marines' installation and logistics
office.
   Neither Sherman nor his attorney would comment. It could not be
determined if he was actually brought before the grand jury.
   Other witnesses, however, were seen entering and leaving the
grand jury room later in the day. Tuesday afternoon, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joseph Aronica, who is in charge of the grand jury, told
reporters ``there won't be any luminaries'' soon.
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, said he filed a motion
to quash the 11 subpoenas issued for Paisley, who served as
assistant Navy secretary for research, engineering and systems from
December 1981 to April 1987 when he became a consultant.
   Barcella said, ``We asked the government to affirm or deny
whether they used illegal electronic surveillance. Even the fact
that they may have gotten authorization does not mean their wiretap
was applied for and carried out in a legal manner. Before we comply
with a subpoena, we want to insure that the government has carried
out its responsibilities under the wiretap statute in an
appropriate and accurate manner.''
   Earlier this month, the government released its search warrant
for Paisley, which indicated that FBI agents were investigating
whether he received payments from General Dynamics, McDonnell
Douglas and Pratt & Whitney while he worked for the Pentagon. The
warrant also showed the government is investigating consulting he
has since done for 10 defense contractors.
   At Unisys, Blumenthal told his employees by letter that the
company pledged full cooperation with Hudson's investigation and
``we expect and encourage each of our employees also to cooperate
fully in responding to the government's inquiries.''
   The new management was installed at the former Sperry
Surveillance and Fire Control Division in Great Neck, N.Y., on Long
Island. The division employs 2,500 of Unisys' 90,000 employees and
had before-tax profits of $18 million in 1987 on $300 million in
revenue.
   In addition to the Great Neck plant, federal agents also
searched offices or homes of Charles Gardner, consultant and former
general manager and vice president at the Unisys Great Neck plant;
Dennis Mitchell, administrative aide at the plant; William Galvin,
a Unisys consultant; and Paisley, who also worked for Unisys.
   Mitchell is reported by several newspapers to have handed checks
to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., as campaign contributions during a tour
he made of the Unisys plant a year ago. Those checks and others
later mailed totaled $14,000, the reports said.
   Blumenthal said senior managers would henceforth approve all
consulting agreements and honoraria paid to members of Congress. He
also hired a Washington law firm to aid in enforcing an ethics
program.

<HEAD>U.S. Probes Defection of Former Navy Man Who Worked With Spy
Photos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are conducting a ``serious
investigation'' into the defection to the Soviet Union of a former
Navy enlisted man and reservist who had access to valuable
satellite intelligence data.
   ``We are quite concerned about what he might have given the
Soviets,'' a Navy source said after Glenn Michael Souther, 31,
appeared on Soviet television Tuesday.
   Souther disappeared in May 1986 after he was confronted by
federal agents in an espionage investigation.
   During his TV appearance, Souther said the FBI had hounded him
out of the country. The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia
reported Sunday that he had been granted asylum in that country.
   Souther had access to classified information while assigned to
Europe and later while on reserve duty in Norfolk, Va., said the
Navy official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Among the duties that Souther had in the Navy was analyzing data
collected by satellites. Access to that sort of information would
tell the Soviets what capabilities the United States has to
photograph their installations and intercept their communications
using satellites, and also what areas U.S. intelligence was
monitoring.
   ``An investigation is under way,'' Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard
told reporters. ``It is a serious investigation.''
   Souther enlisted in the Navy in January 1976, then left active
duty in 1982 after being denied entrance into officer candidate
school, according to Navy sources.
   While on active duty, he served aboard the aircraft carrier USS
Nimitz from July 1976 to November 1978, and was assigned to the 6th
Fleet command in Naples, Italy, in April 1979, where Navy sources
said he would have had access to some intelligence data involving
Soviet military activities in Europe.
   Following an honorable discharge in October 1982, Souther
remained in the reserves as an intelligence specialist.
   On weekends, he worked at the headquarters of the 2nd Fleet
command in Norfolk, Va., a position that may have given him access
to classified information, sources said.
   After leaving active service, Souther enrolled in Old Dominion
University, in Norfolk, where he majored in Russian language.
   Soviet reports of the defection did not indicate when Souther
had arrived in the Soviet Union, whether he had spied for the
Soviet Union before he left the United States, or whether he was
cooperating presently with Soviet intelligence.
   During his appearance on Soviet television, Souther said he
found himself ``confronted with a fateful decision. I had to leave
my country, my family, close friends and relatives.
   ``My guilt is that I regarded my convictions and interests as my
natural rights. But the FBI thought otherwise. I was persecuted and
my freedom was threatened,'' he said.
   An announcer on the main Soviet television news evening program
``Vremya'' said a special broadcast would be made Wednesday night
to better acquaint viewers with Souther's case.
   In November 1986, William Webster, then director of the FBI,
told reporters that Souther was the target of an espionage
investigation.
   FBI officials said Sunday that Souther had been under
surveillance before his disappearance in May 1986, but declined to
give further details of the case.
   Souther disappeared after visiting his mother in the Midwest,
and telling friends that he was going to visit a child he had by
his former wife, an Italian.

   The federal judge handling the Iran-Contra
case is expressing frustration at having to mediate frequent
pre-trial disputes between lawyers for the government and the
defense.
   ``Why is it that the most simple things can't be talked out
among counsel?'' Judge Gerhard A. Gesell asked at a hearing Tuesday
on several motions. ``Why does it have to come to me?
   ``We've got to some way act like human beings to get this case
started.''
   Gesell complained of receiving a number of motions from both
sides seeking information from one another, routine matters on
which attorneys normally reach agreement during conferences.
   ``I hope to some extent you will work these things out,'' he
said.
   In one instance, Barry Simon, an attorney for retired Marine Lt.
Col Oliver North, sought documents prepared by the Israeli
government and given to the independent counsel's office. At the
hearing, prosecutors agreed to provide the defense with classified
documents setting out a chonology of events involving Israeli
officials and citizens in the secret sale of arms to Iran.
   That was when Gesell asked why such matters couldn't be worked
out without his involvement.
   Gesell also was taken aback when Simon announced that he planned
to seek a delay in the start of North's trial, scheduled to begin
Sept. 20.
   ``When are you going to file that motion?'' he asked.
   Simon promised to file the motion today, adding that it would
contain his reasons for seeking the delay.
   ``And I suppose you will want to file a reply,'' Gesell then
said to independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who answered in the
affirmative.
   The judge scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday on the proposed
delay in the start of North's trial.
   Gesell also made a preliminary decision to have another judge
handle the trial of another of the four defendants in the case,
former national security adviser John Poindexter, to protect his
right to a speedy trial.
   With all four defendants to be tried separately, Walsh earlier
had announced his intention to present the case against North
first, a strategy which could delay Poindexter's trial for months.
   Gesell said if he were convinced that a delay in North's trial
was essential, he might decide to proceed with Poindexter's trial
first rather than having another judge take that case.
   Earlier, Gesell had told Poindexter's lawyers, ``If Mr.
Poindexter wants a judge assigned to him and to go to trial right
away, I'll arrange it.''
   Despite objections from Walsh, Gesell said, ``I do feel that if
someone wants a trial I don't want to stand in their way. It's the
right of the defendant to have a speedy trial. ... I don't
understand that I have any authority to defer a trial of a man who
wants one.''
   As pre-trial jockeying continued, Richard Beckler, Poindexter's
defense attorney, said he is readying 10 to 15 different motions on
behalf of his client.
   Defense and prosecution lawyers agreed during the hearing to
work out a procedure for obtaining handwriting samples from the
defendants, a step Walsh has said is essential to his case.
   But Gesell balked at a prosecution request to have new
photographs made of North, Poindexter and the two other defendants,
Richard Secord and Albert Hakim, calling such a step ``very
unusual.''
   North and the other defendants are facing trial on a variety of
charges, including conspiracy to defraud the government by
illegally diverting the proceeds of the sale of U.S. arms to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.

<HEAD>Farm Population Getting Smaller, Older</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm people not only keep getting fewer in
numbers each year, they are older, include more males than females
and are more likely to live in the Midwest than they once were,
says a new government study.
   As for their fading numbers, it's an old story that was repeated
again last year when an estimated 240,000 people left the land,
dropping the nation's farm population to the lowest level since
before the Civil War.
   Officials said an average of 4,986,000 people _ one out of every
49 Americans _ lived on farms in 1987, representing 2 percent of
the U.S. population of 243.4 million.
   That compared with 5,226,000 farm residents in 1986, which was
2.2 percent of the national population of 241.1 million.
   The figures were derived from an annual survey by the Census
Bureau that was released jointly on Tuesday with the Agriculture
Department. A preliminary report was issued on Feb. 8.
   Although the 1987 farm population estimate was down by 240,000
people, the report said that represented ``no statistically
significant change'' from 1986. The one-year decline would have had
to have been at least 275,000 for it be statistically significant,
the report said.
   From 1981 through 1987, the farm population declined an average
of 2.5 percent annually, the report said. In the previous decade,
the annual decline averaged 2.9 percent.
   The report said the 1920 census is regarded as the beginning of
the government's official nose count of the farm population,
although estimates go back much earlier.
   In one table, for example, figures on the number of Americans in
``farm occupations'' go back to 1820, when farm people were
reported at less than 2.1 million, making up about 72 percent of
the U.S. work force of 2.9 million.
   By 1850, there were 4.9 million farm people, representing about
64 percent of the nation's 7.7 million workers.
   The farm population in 1920, when the official census data
began, was nearly 32 million, or 30.2 percent of the U.S.
population of 105.7 million, the report showed.
   According to USDA estimates going back to 1910, however, the
farm population peaked at 32.5 million people in 1916 during World
War I, making up 32 percent of the population of 101.6 million.
   Despite a general downward trend since World War I, the farm
population has had a few short-lived surges, including one during
the Great Depression when it grew to 31.2 million in 1933,
comprising 24.9 percent of the U.S. population of 125.4 million
that year.
   Another slight bulge appeared in 1983 as thousands shifted from
city living to the countryside, raising the farm population to more
than 7 million from 6.88 million in 1982.
   Some other observations included in the 1987 farm population
report:
   _Half of the total farm population lives in the Midwest. The
South has 29 percent; the West, 15 percent; and the Northeast, 6
percent. Officials said reliable state and local farm popuation
figures were not available.
   At midcentury, about a third of all farm people lived in the
Midwest, while slightly more than half were in the South. A rapid
decline of the South's farm population, rather than any growth in
the Midwest, led to the shift.
   _As compared with the non-farm population, the farm population
has a higher proportion of whites, 97 percent. Blacks are 2.5
percent of the farm population and ``other'' races, 0.6 percent.
Those are approximate figures. Hispanics, who may be of any race,
made up 2.7 percent of the farm population, the report said.
   Comparatively, the U.S. non-farm population last year was 84.4
percent white, 12.3 percent black, and 3.3 percent other races, the
Census Bureau said. Hispanics comprised 8.1 percent.
   _The median age of farm residents was 37.6 years in 1987, which
``is significantly higher'' than the non-farm median of 32 years.
The median age is that from which half of the people are older and
half are younger.
   ``In the 1920 census, when data on the farm population were
first collected, their median age was 20.7 years, lower than the
medians for the rural total and the urban population,'' the report
said.
   _Last year, there were 109 males per 100 females living on
farms, compared with just 93 males per 100 females in the non-farm
population. In 1920, the farm ratio was the same, while the
non-farm ratio was 102 males per 100 females.

   A major association of country banks says it
supports drought-aid legislation in Congress that would pour up to
$7 billion into stricken areas to help farmers recover from crop
and livestock losses.
   The Independent Bankers Association of America, which says that
half its members are agricultural banks, sent letters to members of
the Senate and House agricultural committees in support of bills
awaiting final action when Congress returns to work on July 26.
   A version approved by the Senate committee would provide
payments of up to $100,000 to drought-stricken farmers. President
Reagan has indicated he would sign such legislation.
   Association president-elect O. Jay Tomson, Charles City, Iowa,
said Tuesday a special committee concluded that ``the legislation
deserves our full support and prompt enactment.''
   Basically, the legislation would replace a major portion of the
income lost by crop farmers in 1988 due to heat and drought by
reallocating money that would otherwise have gone to farmers as
``deficiency'' payments to compensate them for low commodity prices.
   Drought has cut production and forced up prices, meaning the
payments will be less. Thus, the ``savings'' would be used to
finance the drought benefits.
   In addition, livestock, dairy and poultry producers would be
provided financial aid to help cover higher feed costs and help
them keep their foundation stock.

   Milk production may not increase this year as
much as forecast earlier, the Agriculture Department says in a new
outlook report.
   ``For all of 1988, milk production probably will total about 1
percent more than 1987's 142.5 billion pounds,'' the department's
Economic Research Service said Tuesday.
   Earlier, the agency said the increase could be in the range of 1
percent to 3 percent.

   Gov. Bill Clements was admitted to a
hospital Tuesday after suffering a mild stroke, and was described
later as wide awake and ``absolutely normal,'' his aides said.
   ``Gov. Clements has had a slight stroke that had affected his
vision,'' spokesman Reggie Bashur, said Tuesday night.
   ``His vision right now is almost all back to normal. There are
no other difficulties or symptoms,'' Bashur said.
   Clements, 71, checked in to Seton Medical Center at about 6:30
p.m., walking in on his own, said M.A. Bengston, a hospital
spokeswoman. He was accompanied by his usual Department of Public
Safety escorts.
   He was listed in good condition, she said.
   Clements, a Republican, served a term as governor from 1979 to
1983 and was elected to a second term in 1986. He is the first
Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction.
   Bashur said the governor ate a full dinner at the hospital and
seemed in good health. ``He is walking around,'' he said. ``He's
smiling. He feels fine.''
   George Bayoud, Clements' chief of staff, said Clements told him
Tuesday afternoon and said he was not feeling well and was going to
see his doctor.
   But ``if you saw him right now ... he looks absolutely normal,''
Bayoud said Tuesday evening.
   Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby, at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta as a delegate, was aware of the situation but would not be
returning to Texas early because he is not needed, Bayoud said.
   Bashur said the governor was expected to remain at the hospital
for two to three days for observation.
   The only medication being administered to Clements was aspirin,
said Bashur, who talked with Seton neurologist Dr. Jerry Tindel.
   Clements' wife, Rita, also was at the hospital, the spokesman
said.

<HEAD>Cuban Flexibility on Angola Intrigues US</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say they are intrigued by a
sudden interest shown by Cuban authorities in reaching an agreement
on the withdrawal of the almost 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   This was one of several signs that emerged from a meeting last
week which have given the administration fresh hope that an
agreement leading to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from
southwestern Africa may be possible.
   At the meeting in New York, officials from South Africa, Cuba
and Angola signed a tentative agreement on a statement of
principles that would govern future negotiations for comprehensive
troop withdrawals.
   Barring an unexpected snag, the three governments were expected
to announce final approval of the statement today and make it
public.
   The United States is serving as a mediator in the talks, which
began in early May. For the past seven years, the Reagan
administration has attempted to find a formula that would lead to
both a Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and independence and
black majority rule for Namibia, a colony of South Africa.
   The Cubans have added up to 15,000 troops to their military
presence in Angola since last fall but at the same time have shown
a much greater willingness to work out an agreement on a total
withdrawal, said the officials, insisting on anonymity.
   Among South Africa's many foreign critics, few have been more
outspoken than Cuba but the tone of last week's meeting indicated a
strong desire for a settlement, the officials said.
   ``The Cubans are saying to South Africans, `it's not a question
of victory and defeat, it's a question of building peace,' and
South Africa is saying, `we agree with you,''' one senior official
said. ``The Angolans agreed with them both.''
   Cuban troops initially were sent to Angola in 1975 to protect
the fledgling Marxist government there against South African
military incursions. South African troops are continuing to support
an American-backed rebel group in Angola and years of U.S. effort
to promote a settlement foundered until last week. In the process,
the Angolan economy has declined steadily and there has been
considerable loss of life.
   The officials are uncertain as to why Cuba now seems more
agreeable to withdrawing its forces. One possible explanation is
pressure from the Soviet Union, which earlier this year agreed to
withdraw its forces from Afghanistan and wields substantial
influence over Cuba and Angola, two of Moscow's closest allies and
largest aid recipients.
   The official said Cuba ``is either negotiating seriously or
making an effort to create that impression.''
   He added that if Cuba agrees to withdraw its troops from Angola
in return for a similar move by South Africa and a commitment by
Pretoria to decolonize Namibia, the Cubans ``could go home with
their heads held high.''
   The biggest remaining obstacle is a timetable for the mutual
troop withdrawals.
   Under a United Nations resolution, the independence process in
Namibia would be carried out over a one-year time frame once South
Africa consents to that step. That timetable is considered
non-negotiable.
   But South Africa, with U.S. backing, has said the South African
withdrawal will not take place unless Cuba agrees to withdraw its
forces simultaneously.
   In effect, that appears to mean Cuba would have to agree to
roughly a one-year withdrawal timetable or there is no agreement.
   As an opening bargaining position, Cuba and Angola have talked
of a four-year period for the Cuban pullback but both sides have
indicated flexibility on that point.
   The official said the question of a timetable will be discussed
in early August during the next meeting of the four countries.
   ``I want to force that discussion to take place,'' the official
said. ``We need to have that conversation now.''

<HEAD>Bush Camp Sees Long, Tight Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican strategists are unfazed by an
expected boost in the polls for Michael Dukakis due to his exposure
at the Democratic National Convention, predicting a tight
presidential race over the long haul.
   ``I think it's going to be a very late election to a certain
extent, because I don't think voters are focusing on the election
and I don't think they care too much about it,'' said Lee Atwater,
campaign manager for Vice President George Bush.
   Atwater said Tuesday a boost in Dukakis' popularity is probable
in the wake of the convention, and GOP consultant Roger Stone
predicted it would be ``an artificial boost, maybe as much as 7 to
10 points.''
   Stone noted that Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democratic
presidential nominee, received a large push in the polls from the
party's convention in San Francisco but it was a short-lived gain.
   ``All of it dissipated within three weeks after the
convention,'' Stone said. ``It is beneficial to George Bush that
the Republican convention is second.''
   David Carmen, a GOP consultant and former adviser to New York
Rep. Jack Kemp's presidential campaign, said Bush is in far better
shape now than was former President Gerald Ford in 1976. Ford
trailed Democrat Jimmy Carter by 30 points after the Democratic
convention.
   ``I'm not so certain Dukakis is going to get quite the boost out
of the convention everybody thinks,'' Carmen said. ``He may get
only three points or so, and that would be a real victory for our
side.''
   ``Bush has halted what was perceived as a decline in the polls
and now has risen back up. So it's clear that he's not going to
come out of the Democratic convention so far down that it will be
irrecoverable,'' Carmen said.
   GOP advisers said they were buoyed by an ABC survey, taken on
the eve of the convention, that showed Bush had 46 percent support,
compared to 45 percent for Dukakis _ statistically a dead heat. It
was the first national poll since Dukakis' selection of Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as his running mate.
   Earlier polls had shown Dukakis with more than a 10-point lead
over Bush.
   A USA Today-Cable News Network survey taken July 6-10 showed 47
percent for Bush, 44 percent for Dukakis.
   ``What we're seeing now is a natural tightening of the race,''
Stone said.
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign spokeswoman Sheila Tate said that the
vice president, fishing in Wyoming with Treasury Secretary James A.
Baker III, had no plans to watch or listen to the Democratic
National Convention.
   ``He wanted to stare at a fish eye, not the CBS eye or the NBC
peacock,'' Ms. Tate said.
   Although Bush has been lying low since Saturday on his trip with
Baker, who is expected to become his campaign chairman, the vice
president was to reappear Wednesday with two evening campaign
appearances in the Detroit area.
   He had also had events scheduled in North Carolina and South
Carolina on Thursday, the final day of the Democratic convention.

<HEAD>Colin Powell Says U.S. Won't Withdraw Completely From Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's national security adviser
says he does not believe the United States will ever withdraw all
its naval forces from the Persian Gulf, despite hopes of a
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, answering questions during a rare
speaking engagement before the Los Angeles World Affairs Council on
Tuesday, also said prospects of a strategic arms reduction
agreement with the Soviets in this administration are growing
dimmer each week.
   On a question about the Middle East, he argued that the
administration's sale of advanced F-18 aircraft with Maverick
missiles to Kuwait would be ``in the interests of Israel'' because
the United States would control how the airplanes are used.
   On Latin American affairs, Powell said the next president ``will
probably face a situation of accelerating deterioration'' in
Central America unless Congress approves ``effective aid'' for
Nicaragua's Contra rebels.
   He said the United States is continuing to try to find ways to
convince Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and his associates
that Noriega should step down.
   And he said the United States will not allow the Panama Canal to
be controlled by any future Panamanian government that does not
``share the same strategic view that we do of the importance of ...
freedom of navigation through the canal.''
   In his speech, Powell said, ``Panama continues to be a problem,
but we will continue to support the hopes for democracy in that
troubled country.''
   When asked what avenues the United States was pursuing towards
that goal, he said economic sanctions and diplomatic efforts were
continuing and, ``We continue to try to find ways to convince
Noriega and others in power that the only solution is for Noriega
to step down.''
   The wide-ranging question-and-answer session followed a speech
in which Powell appealed to Americans to ``remember that next Jan.
20 we must come together in support of our new president,'' whoever
that may be.
   Powell made the speech while in California during President
Reagan's week-long vacation at his ranch north of Santa Barbara.
The White House said the national security adviser is giving the
president daily briefings on the world situation.
   The question of the Persian Gulf arose as Powell was asked
whether, in view of continuing hostilities, he was still encouraged
by Iran's announcement that it will accept a year-old United
Nations cease-fire resolution.
   ``I think we have to be encouraged by what Iran did,'' he said.
``In my judgment, it is a breakthrough, but it is only a first
step. The war goes on.''
   However, he said, ``Notwithstanding the fact that the fighting
is still going on, I am encouraged and hopeful that the general
secretary (of the United Nations, Javier Perez de Cuellar) will be
successful in getting a cease-fire in place in the very near
future.''
   When asked whether a cease-fire would bring about withdrawal of
the U.S. naval presence from the gulf, Powell said, ``Because of
the importance of that waterway and our strategic interests in the
region, I do not see us ever removing our forces from the Persian
Gulf.''
   The United States has maintained warships in the Persian Gulf
since 1949. The typical force in most years was two destroyers.
   On a strategic arms reduction treaty with the Soviet Union,
Powell said, ``We are working hard. Perhaps it can still be done,
but with each passing week it becomes much more difficult to see
the outcome within this administration.''
   In regard to the F-18 sale, bitterly opposed by supporters of
Israel, Powell argued that the Kuwaitis have a ``legitmate need''
for the aircraft and missiles and will obtain them elswhere if not
from the United States.
   ``The cash is in their pocket,'' he said, adding that if they
buy the F-18s from the United States ``we end up having a great
deal of control over how the aircraft are used. That is in our
interest and in the interest of Israel.''
   Powell discussed Central America among other issues in the body
of his speech, saying, ``Unless Congress and the president _ which
means ultimately the American people _ come to agreement on a
program of effective aid for the Nicaraguan resistance as an
adjunct to our diplomatic strategy, the next president will
probably face a situation of accelerating deterioration, as all the
local democracies will come under growing strains as Nicaragua
growes stronger, more assertive and more aggressive.''
   In response to a question about the Panama Canal treaties, he
said he thought the pacts were ``a good idea at the time,'' but
added that the United States is ``prepared to do what is necessary
to keep the canal from ever being put at risk.'' He said the
waterway should be turned over ``only to a Panamanian government
that is responsive and that shows the same strong view that we do
of the importance of ... freedom of navigation through the canal.''

   During a luncheon in 1986, Attorney General
Edwin Meese III told three men now under indictment in the Wedtech
scandal that he wanted to refinance his mortgage to take advantage
of lower interest rates.
   According to an 814-page report issued this week by independent
counsel James McKay, one of Meese's three lunch partners, longtime
friend E. Robert Wallach, stepped in to help, contacting a
Washington banker. That led to a $260,000 mortgage loan for Meese
five months later from a financial institution in Washington.
   McKay examined the circumstances surrounding the Jan. 29, 1986,
lunch between Meese, Wallach, Meese's financial manager W. Franklyn
Chinn and Wedtech consultant R. Kent London in an attempt to
determine whether Meese may have violated federal bribery or
gratuity laws.
   That same day, the report notes, London's company had been paid
$1 million by Wedtech Corp. in compensation for services to the
South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor.
   In his report, McKay concluded that no portion of the $1 million
was passed on to Meese and that the subsequent mortgage loan was
not made under preferential terms.
   McKay did not find grounds to indict Meese, but the attorney
general now faces an inquiry by the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility. The OPR is expected to use McKay's
report as a basis for determining whether Meese may have violated
ethical standards for officials in the executive branch of
government.
   McKay's report found that Meese probably twice violated the
conflict-of-interest law by participating as attorney general in
matters affecting the telecommunications industry while he was
holding regional Bell telephone stock.
   A 1965 executive order setting out standards of ethical conduct
for government officers directs that employees avoid any action
which might create the appearance of giving preferential treatment
to any organization or person, losing complete independence or
impartiality of action or affecting adversely the confidence of the
public in the integrity of the government.
   That executive order also prohibits any action which might
create the appearance of making a government decision outside
official channels.
   McKay found that Wallach engaged in a number of activities which
were ``of substantial benefit'' to Meese, including representing
Meese without charge in connection with his nomination and
confirmation hearings to become attorney general.
   McKay also said Wallach assisted in obtaining a paying job for
Meese's wife, Ursula, and helped the Meeses get an $80,000 bank
loan in 1983 as well as facilitating the 1986 loan of $260,000 to
refinance Meese's mortgage.
   McKay found that Meese helped Wallach by interceding on behalf
of Wedtech Corp. in 1981 in a move that culminated in a $32 million
engine-building contract for the company and also by assisting the
attorney in connection with a $1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project.
   At Wallach's request, the attorney general arranged a meeting
between Wallach and then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane
and Wallach's client, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport, in 1985 in
connection with the proposed oil pipeline.
   OPR is responsible for determining whether any violations of
executive branch ethics standards and rules may have taken place.
It has the authority to issue reports on allegations of wrongdoing
or unethical conduct and to recommend reprimand, censure and, in
the case of current employees, recommend dismissal.
   Wallach, Chinn and London face trial next Jan. 3 on charges of
conspiracy, fraud and racketeering which involve allegations that
they attempted to use Meese to help Wedtech. Meese wasn't charged.

<HEAD>Voinovich Outspending Metzenbaum in Senate Race So Far</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and
Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich were virtually dead even in the
past few months in fund-raising for their Senate battle in Ohio,
campaign finance reports show.
   The candidates' reports, made public this week, show that from
April 14 through June 30, Republican Voinovich raised $1.5 million
compared with $1.4 million for Metzenbaum.
   Voinovich, who is challenging Metzenbaum for the Senate, spent
$1.1 million over the 2{-month period compared, while Metzenbaum
spent $455,000, according to the reports.
   Metzenbaum's campaign warchest grew to about $4.9 million, while
Voinovich's cash reserves as of June 30 were $1.3 million.
   Over the first six months of 1988, Voinovich led Metzenbaum in
both contributions and expenditures. Voinovich raised $2.9 million
and spent $2.3 million, while Metzenbaum raised $2.1 million and
spent $1.3 million.
   Voinovich also led Metzenbaum in contributions from political
action and other political participation committees.

   Jesse Jackson saluted Democratic nominee-to-be
Michael Dukakis on Tuesday night as a rival who ``always resisted
the temptation to stoop to demagoguery,'' and called on his
supporters to join him on common ground with Dukakis for victory in
the fall.
   ``We meet tonight at a crossroads, a point of decision. Shall we
expand, be inclusive, find unity and power; or suffer division and
impotence,'' Jackson asked a packed hall. ``The only time we win is
when we come together.''
   Jackson, calling his own work ``ancient and endless,'' never
endorsed the Massachusetts governor for the presidency in the
50-minute speech to the Democratic National Convention.
   ``I'll make the appropriate decision at the appropriate time,''
Jackson said afterward.
   Even without the endorsement, the Dukakis campaign termed the
speech was ``terrific.''
   Campaign manager Susan Estrich said, ``I think everyone in the
Dukakis campaign tonight stands side-by-side with our friends in
the Jackson campaign.''
   After the address _ the final major speech of his remarkable
1988 campaign for the White House _ Jackson dived into the mass of
delegates on the convention floor to shake hands and receive
congratulations.
   He had been scheduled to speak in prime television time, but the
platform debates sought by his forces pushed its start to the very
last minute before 11 p.m. on the East Coast.
   Jackson was introduced by his five children and by a brief film
highlighting his campaign efforts.
   ``To many he is a hero. To us he is also our father,'' said
Jesse L. Jackson Jr.
   Jackson was greeted by a sea of red ``Jesse! Jesse! Jesse!''
signs as he walked to the podium with his wife Jackie. Dukakis
aides urged the blue Dukakis signs be kept down during the speech
and some Dukakis delegates gave up their seats to Jackson
alternates to give them a better view of their candidate.
   Like never before, Jackson praised Dukakis.
   ``Tonight I salute Gov. Michael Dukakis,'' he said. ``He has run
a well-managed and dignified campaign. No matter how tired or how
tried, he always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery.
   ``I have watched a good mind fast at work, with steel nerves,
guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the
worst of us. I have watched his perspective grow as his environment
has expanded. I've seen his toughness and tenacity close up.''
   Over and over again, Jackson returned to the image that has been
central to his second bid for the presidency _ common ground.
   ``When we divide, we cannot win. So our challenge here is to
find common ground,'' Jackson said.
   As he has before, Jackson noted that he and Dukakis had widely
different backgrounds. ``There are differences of religion, region
and race, differences in experience and perspectives, but the
genius of America is that out of the many we become one,'' he said.
   ``His foreparents came to America in immigrant ships. My
foreparents came to America on slave ships. But whatever the
original ships, we are both in the same boat tonight,'' Jackson
said. ``Our ships could pass in the night _ if we have a false
sense of independence _ they could collide and crash ... But we can
seek a higher reality and a greater good ... At our highest, we can
call upon our noble instincts and navigate this vessel to safety.''
   After the long campaign, Jackson said, he and Dukakis have come
together and ``share a common commitment to new priorities, to
expansion and to inclusion.''
   But he hinted there were still rough spots in the relationship.
   ``There is a higher good beyond personal comfort or position.
The good of our nation is at stake,'' he said.
   Jackson gave an emotional history of the civil rights movement
that gave him his start and opened the door for his twin bids for
the presidency.
   ``My right and my privilege to stand here before you has been
won _ in my lifetime _ by the blood and the sweat of the
innocent,'' he said.
   ``Dr. Martin Luther King lies only a few miles from us,''
Jackson said. ``Tonight he must feel good as he looks down upon us
... His heart would be full tonight.''
   And Jackson brought Rosa Parks, whose refusal to sit in the back
of a Birmingham bus triggered King's rise to prominence, to the
podium, saying all the delegates are really standing on her
shoulders.
   Stressing unity, Jackson said the continuation of his campaign
through the Wednesday night roll call was a necessary step in
history.
   ``As a statement to the struggles of those who have gone before;
as a legacy for those who will come after; as a tribute to the
endurance, the patience, the courage of our forefathers and
mothers; as an assurance that their prayers are being answered;
their work was not in vain; and hope is eternal _ tomorrow night my
name will go into nomination for the presidency of the United
States.''
   Jackson made clear that his crusade is not over, even after
Dukakis formally wins the party's nomination Wednesday night.
   ``My work to keep America strong and make America better is
ancient and endless. We can win,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson closed his speech with what has become a slogan for him
and for his political efforts for the future:
   ``Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive.''
   Before the speech, Jackson's supporters were predicting that
emotions within the convention hall would reach an emotional peak
when the civil rights leader stepped to the podium.
   ``They might have to come take me out in an ambulance,'' said
alternate Alvin Dollar of Decatur, Ga.
   And afterward, the reaction was positive.
   ``The man is on target. Nobody can do it better,'' said State
Rep. Al Edwards of Texas.
   Many of those who sought to hear Jackson were denied entrance to
The Omni when the fire marshal declared the convention hall filled
to capacity, stranding hundreds of delegates, guests and reporters.
Some delegates were allowed to re-enter the hall in time for the
speech.
   Jackson's address recalled his performance at the 1984
Democratic Convention in San Francisco.
   Then, at the end of his first bid for the presidency, Jackson
brought the Democratic delegates to theirfeet with tears in their
eyes with his apology for the ``low moments'' of his historic run
for the White House.
   ``That was not my truest self,'' Jackson told a hushed San
Francisco hall four years ago. ``If there were occasions when my
grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance,
please forgive me. ... As I develop and serve, be patient. God is
not finished with me yet.''
   Jackson used that speech to deliver his endorsement of the 1984
Democratic presidential nominee, Walter Mondale, but at the same
time proclaimed that his own crusade _ the Rainbow Coalition _
would continue.

   The leftist government of Nicaragua has no right
to claim almost $900,000 held in the United States for a Nicaraguan
steel company that was confiscated by the government, a federal
appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said the money
should be distributed to the company's original shareholders,
principally a family that fled Nicaragua in 1979 when the
Sandinistas were overthrowing the Somoza government.
   The court rejected Nicaragua's contention that the disputed
money should be turned over to the present government there.
   The unanimous decision by the three-judge panel was written by
Judge Irving R. Kaufman, who emphasized that Nicaragua had seized
the company without compensating the original owners.
   Nicaragua is considering whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court, said Michael Krinsky, a lawyer representing the Nicaraguan
government's representatives here.
   In the ruling, Kaufman noted that Industria Nacional de Clavos y
Alambres de Puas, which produced and distributed steel products,
was founded by Salvador Bandes. The Bandes family, ``along with
numerous other associates of the tottering Somoza regime,'' fled
the country in June 1979, the ruling said.
   Shortly thereafter, the new Sandinista government took over the
company. The Bandes family sought a refund of $420,000 that the
steel concern had paid to a Connecticut company for a shipment that
was never completed.
   Harlow & Jones Inc., the U.S. company, agreed to send the refund
to the Bandes family. But the Nicaraguan government intervened on
the grounds that it now operated the company and should get the
refund instead.
   With interest, the disputed amount now totals nearly $900,000.
   Tuesday's decision affirmed a ruling early this year by U.S.
District Judge Richard Owen that the money should be distributed to
the shareholders who owned the company before it was confiscated.
Two former generals of the Somoza regime are among the other
shareholders.
   Kaufman said the ``act of state doctrine,'' which usually bars
U.S. courts from questioning the validity of acts carried out by a
foreign government in its own territory, does not apply to property
held in the United States.

   The cast of the National Ballet of Canada's
``Onegin'' _ with Natalia Makarova as guest artist _ danced with
breathtaking technique and plumbed the depths of the characters and
story on Tuesday night.
   It was the second program of the company's week at the
Metropolitan Opera.
   John Cranko choreographed ``Onegin,'' using the Pushkin story
and Tchaikovsky music, in rich and varied ballet language for his
company, the Stuttgart Ballet, in 1965. This company first produced
it in 1984.
   The Canadian dancers treat it the way fine classical actors
treat Shakespeare, searching to portray more and deeper humanity.
   Miss Makarova can scarcely be overpraised. Her Tatiana felt
everything deeply. She is tremulous when she meets the poet Eugene
Onegin. She blossoms when he dances with her. Later they do a
passionate, chaste, romantic duet in her imagination. She is
crushed when, in reality, he rejects her love letter.
   Miss Makarova rose to still greater heights in the last act,
dancing in understanding and affection with her elderly husband
(Serge Lavoie) then dancing with Onegin again. That dance begins
stiffly because of their memories, then they thrill to be together
again. When Tatiana rejects Onegin at the end of it, Miss Makarova
makes it understood that she hasn't been leading Onegin on, for
revenge. She stands, finally, in love, despair and fortitude at
doing the right thing.
   Ivan Liska was a handsome Onegin, a fascinating man of the world
bored by simple country folk, sometimes capable of feeling. Jeremy
Ransom danced Lensky, the friend Onegin kills in a duel. Ransom has
strong stage presence, at times looking like Rudolf Nureyev.
   Cynthia Lucas also made her dancing and portrayal crystal clear.
As Tatiana's sister Olga, she was in love with Lensky but found it
great fun to dance with the tall stranger, Onegin.
   The corps de ballet was admirable, in the rural ball and later
in the ball at St. Petersburg.

   Here is the text of the speech by Jesse Jackson
delivered to the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday.
   Tonight we pause and give praise and honor to God for being good
enough to allow us to be at this place at this time. When I look
out at this convention, I see the face of America, red, yellow,
brown, black and white, we're all precious in God's sight _ the
real rainbow coalition. All of us, all of us who are here and think
that we are seated. But we're really standing on someone's
shoulders. Ladies and gentlemen. Mrs. Rosa Parks.
   The mother of the civil rights movement.
   I want to express my deep love and appreciation for the support
my family has given me over these past months.
   They have endured pain, anxiety, threat and fear.
   But they have been strengthened and made secure by a faith in
God, in America and in you.
   Your love has protected us and made us strong.
   To my wife Jackie, the foundation of our family; to our five
children whom you met tonight; to my mother Mrs. Helen Jackson, who
is present tonight; and to my grandmother, Mrs. Maltilda Burns; my
brother Chuck and his family; my mother-in-law, Mr. Gertrude Brown,
who just last month at age 61 graduated from Hampton Institute, a
marvelous achievement; I offer my appreciation to Mayor Andrew
Young who has provided such gracious hospitality to all of us this
week.
   And a special salute to President Jimmy Carter.
   President Carter restored honor to the White House after
Watergate. He gave many of us a special opportunity to grow. For
his kind words, for his unwavering commitment to peace in the world
and the voters that came from his family, every member of his
family, led by Billy and Amy, I offer him my special thanks,
special thanks to the Carter family.
   My right and my privilege to stand here before you has been won
_ in my lifetime _ by the blood and the sweat of the innocent.
   Twenty-four years ago, the late Fanny Lou Hamer and Aaron Henry
_ who sits here tonight from Mississippi _ were locked out on the
streets of Atlantic City, the head of the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party.
   But tonight, a black and white delegation from Mississippi is
headed by Ed Cole, a black man, from Mississippi, 24 years later.
   Many were lost in the struggle for the right to vote. Jimmy Lee
Jackson, a young student, gave his life. Viola Luizzo, a white
mother from Detroit, called nigger lover, and brains blown out at
point blank range.
   Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney _ two Jews and a black _ found in
a common grave, bodies riddled with bullets in Mississippi. The
four darling little girls in the church in Birmingham, Ala. They
died that we might have a right to live.

<HEAD>U.S. Renews Cease-Fire Call</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is expressing
support for United Nations efforts to nail down a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war and backing away from its call for an international
arms embargo on Iran.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley on Tuesday said that
if U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar succeeds in using
diplomacy to achieve the cease-fire, ``there wouldn't be need for a
second, follow-up resolution'' calling for the arms embargo.
   The Soviet Union joined with the United States in approving a
resolution last July for a cease-fire, but refused to put force
behind it with an arms embargo. Instead, the Soviets said they
favored more diplomacy, particularly through Perez de Cuellar's
office in New York.
   Mrs. Oakley declined to credit Moscow with choosing the more
effective course, saying U.S. pressure had contributed to Iran's
decision to finally accept the cease-fire order.
   ``I think you have to look at the first steps that are being
taken as a testament to the success of a firm and consistent
policy,'' she said.
   The State Department official said its other accomplishments
included protecting freedom of navigation and preventing the spread
of Soviet influence in the gulf region.
   However, the Center for Defense Information, a private research
group, said that while attacks on merchant shipping had declined a
bit since December, the toll since Reagan ordered the U.S. Navy to
protect neutral shipping last July had increased.
   Since July 22 of last year, when 11 Kuwaiti tankers were
re-flagged with the Stars and Stripes, 188 merchant ships have been
attacked, 106 by Iran and 82 by Iraq. A total of 320 merchant
seamen were killed.
   A year earlier, there were 117 attacks, 54 by Iran and 63 by
Iraq, the center's Brian McCarten said.
   While Perez de Cuellar moved to try to implement the cease-fire,
Iran on Tuesday claimed Iraqi forces had attacked a nuclear plant
and other Iranian targets. Iranian warplanes retaliated by raiding
a dam in Iraq.
   The Reagan administration, meanwhile, hesitated to reduce the
potent flotilla of 18 U.S. warships that keep an eye on the 7.7
million barrels a day of oil that pass through the Strait of Hormuz.
   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said it was too early to
``speculate`` when a cease-fire in the eight-year war might permit
a reduction of U.S. warships.
   When all provisions of the United Nations cease-fire resolution
are implemented, Howard said, ``the United States and its allies
would no doubt reassess their expanded naval presence in the gulf.''
   ``But it is early days yet, and premature to speculate on when,
where, how, or any kind of timetable. We will have to wait and see.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, House Armed Services Committee
Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Iran's embrace of the cease-fire
plan should be treated cautiously.
   ``Our reaction should not be ecstasy that peace is at hand nor
dismissal that the Iranians are lying,'' Aspin said in a prepared
statement.
   He said there are two possible reasons for the announcement: ``a
genuine change'' by Iran or ``a mere ploy to buy time to better
prepare militarily.''

   Meegan appeared at the Guinness World of Records exhibit on
Tuesday to receive a certificate honoring his walk through the
Americas _ a 19,017-mile jaunt that took seven uears and four
months and was completed in 1983.
   Meegan, a resident of Kent, England, is the author of ``The
Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit.'' He walked from the
tip of South America to the end of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, crossing
14 countries.
   While receiving the certificate, he also gave his boots to the
Guinness exhibit. He then delighted the crowd by showing off the

   Four teen-agers say they have unraveled the
mystery behind a stolen powder blue chiffon dress belonging to the
pop singer Madonna. But police say they aren't sure if the teens'
story is ``true blue.''
   The dress was taken Friday evening from a mall display sponsored
by the cable music station MTV and awaits identification by
officials from the exhibit, Detective Ralph Fluhart said on Tuesday.
   Fluhart said the teen-agers told police they found the dress in
the bushes near the mall on the night of the theft.
   But he said their story leaves some unanswered questions, such
as why the dress didn't appear soiled or to have been wet, although
it was raining the night of the theft.
   ``It was in the same condition it was in when it was stolen,''
Fluhart said.
   The pop singer wore the low-cut sequined frock in the video for
the song ``True Blue.'' She donated it for MTV's Museum of
Unnatural History, currently traveling across the country.

   Actress Barbara Stanwyck recently
spent 2{ weeks in the hospital for a back problem that has plagued
her for the past 25 years, her publicist said.
   Miss Stanwyck, who turned 81 on Saturday, was released earlier
this month from St. John's Medical Center where she was admitted
for treatment of the recurring back ailment, spokesman Larry Kleno
said on Tuesday.
   ``She still has 10 fractured vertebrae which flare up from time
to time,'' he said. ``When the pain gets so excruciating, she goes
to the hospital for heat pack treatment.''
   Miss Stanwyck originally injured her back while performing her
own horse riding and other stunts in films and during the 1960s
television show ``The Big Valley.''
   Miss Stanwyck was nominated four times for Academy Awards and
received an honorary Oscar in 1982 for the body of her work. She
has won three television Emmy Awards.

   Jonathon ``Chico'' DeBarge pleaded
innocent to charges he was involved in a cocaine trafficking ring,
a week after the pop singer was dropped from an anti-drug telethon.
   DeBarge, 22, was arraigned Monday on the drug charges. If
convicted, he faces a maximum of life imprisonment and a $4 million
fine.
   U.S. Magistrate Hugh W. Brenneman Jr. allowed DeBarge to remain
free on a $400,000 bond pending a pretrial conference in two weeks.
   Jeffrey Kildow, head of the local U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, said DeBarge, his brother, Robert, and five other
men brought large quantities of cocaine from California to sell in
Michigan.
   Robert DeBarge, arrested last week in California, is to be freed
on a $50,000 bond.
   Last weekend, DeBarge was dropped from the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department anti-drug telethon following his arrest.
   The telethon was to raise money for the Substance Abuse
Narcotics Education program, or SANE, which is a 3-year-old project
to teach elementary school children how to avoid drugs.

<HEAD>Butkus Tackles `NFL Today' As Snyder Replacement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Chicago Bears star Dick Butkus will
attempt to tackle Jimmy ``The Greek'' Snyder's old job on CBS'
``NFL Today'' show, the network announced.
   Butkus, 45, will be joined in the studio by ``NFL Today''
veterans Brent Musburger, Irv Cross and Will McDonough, the network
announced Tuesday.
   Snyder was dismissed in January after making controversial
remarks about black athletes during a television interview.
   Butkus, who played nine seasons with the Bears, retired from
football in 1973 because of a severe knee injury. He was inducted
into the pro football Hall of Fame in 1979.
   Three other former NFL players _ Jack Youngblood, Gary Fencik
and Lyle Alzado _ auditioned for the television job, according to
CBS.
   After leaving football, Butkus became an actor. He appeared in
the television series ``Blue Thunder'' and otehr television shows,
movies and commercials, including a long-running series for a beer
company.
   For the past four years, Butkus has been a commentator on Bears
games for a Chicago radio station. Last season, he was also a guest
analyst on one of ESPN's prime-time NFL telecasts.
   Snyder, who had worked on ``NFL Today'' for 12 years, was fired
after saying blacks were bred to be better athletes and were taking
over the profession. He later apologized for the remarks, which
triggered a storm of protest after they aired on a Washington
television station.

   Police sealed all entrances to the Democratic
National Convention shortly before the long-awaited speech by Jesse
Jackson on Tuesday night, blaming overcrowding in the arena.
   Tempers flared as a crowd of about 1,000 delegates, guests and
reporters pressed against police lines trying in vain to enter The
Omni.
   ``This is unbelievable,'' said Stanley Watkins, a Jackson
delegate from Chicago and an at-large member of the Democratic
National Committee. ``They should have known this was going to
happen. I think they should have had it in a bigger hall.''
   Among those in the crowd outside the arena was Sen. Sam Nunn of
Georgia, who had addressed the convention a short time earlier.
Asked whether he was upset at apparently being excluded from the
hall, he replied, ``I won't comment.'' But aides said later Nunn
had intended all along to return to his hotel after his speech.
   At first, police ordered everyone outside the convention hall to
head across the street to the World Congress Center, where the
proceedings were being televised on a large screen in an auditorium.
   No one moved.
   About a half-hour later, the hall was opened briefly, and about
35 delegates were allowed in. But other delegates were still
waiting outside when the hall was closed again.
   The Omni is a basketball arena normally seating 16,237 people,
but that capacity was cut to about 11,000 when the hall was
remodeled to accommodate the convention.
   A city ordinance says people can be prevented from entering a
building once it has reached ``standing room only,'' said Benjamin
Sims, a spokesman for the Atlanta Department of Public Safety.
   More than 5,300 delegates and alternates were to attend the
convention. Other seats in the hall were filled by guests and
reporters.
   The guests and reporters were much on the mind of Richard Koster
of Panama, co-chairman of the tiny delegation representing
Democrats Abroad who was among those stuck outside the hall.
   ``You guys we need, but you're not crucial,'' Koster said to a
reporter. ``Fat cats are great, but they're not crucial.''
   Many delegates were sent from gate to gate, each time being told
they could get in through the next gate. Some formed a human log
jam in front of the police line. Others elbowed their way through
the crowd, yelling ``delegate, delegate'' as they made their way
toward the police line. There were shouts of ``Let me in'' and
``This is America buddy.''
   Marie Jackson held a guest pass from the Louisiana delegation
and waved it in the air. ``I think this is ridiculous. We don't
want these things for souvenirs,'' she said. ``If I don't get to
hear Jesse it's going to turn me off from this election.''
   ``It's really a heartbreak when you drive 487 miles and you
can't get in,'' said Huiet Joseph, her grandson, who had a
messenger pass from the Louisiana delegation.
   By the time Jackson's speech was under way, the crowd had
dwindled to a few hundred.
   Jim McDonald of the convention security staff said access to The
Omni was halted at 10 p.m. when officials with the Atlanta Fire
Department determined it was filled beyond safe capacity.
   ``It was overcrowded,'' McDonald said. ``I'm not going to get
into numbers. But it's already over the number they originally gave
us. It's enough.''

<HEAD>Government Ordered To Reinstate Fired GSA Official</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former federal employee who was fired after
he warned that major government buildings had deteriorated into
hazardous condition has been ordered reinstated with back pay and
legal fees.
   The Merit Systems Protection Board ordered that Bertrand G.
Berube, who lost his job five years ago, be returned to his post at
the General Services Administration, the government's housekeeping
agency.
   ``I'm really pleased at the way it came out,'' Berube said
Tuesday. ``I feel fully vindicated after five years. ... I'm all
ready to go back to work.''
   The award of back pay and legal fees could total as much as
$750,000.
   ``If indeed it goes into effect, it will be the largest award of
this type in the history of the civil service,'' said Louis Clark,
one of Berube's attorneys and director of the Government
Accountability Project, a non-profit group that seeks to assist
whistle-blowers.
   Clark said he hopes the Berube case will have broad
implications. ``I hope it sends a signal to agencies that the Merit
Systems Protection Board is not going to rubber stamp their
terminations of people like Bert Berube,'' he said.
   He added that in view of the large amount of publicity generated
by the Berube case, ``I believe this result will encourage other
whistle-blowers to fight on against their agency despite the
immense odds they may face.''
   At the time of his firing in 1983, Berube was regional
administrator of the GSA's national capital region, overseeing
7,000 people and a budget of $2 billion. He was in charge of
maintaining virtually every government building in Washington, from
the White House to the Pentagon.
   Then-GSA Administrator Gerald P. Carmen dismissed Berube after
he alleged that many federal buildings in Washington posed serious
fire and health hazards. Berube said GSA officials were routinely
deferring needed building repairs so they could claim budget
savings.
   The board's ruling calling for Berube's reinstatement can be
appealed to the courts.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Hahn, Attorney to Repay Unspent Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jessica Hahn should return the $150,000
trust fund she received from the PTL ministry in exchange for her
silence over her sexual encounter with former PTL President Jim
Bakker, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled Tuesday.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds entered the judgment
Tuesday against Ms. Hahn and a Los Angeles lawyer who administered
the trust fund, Scott Furstman.
   PTL had sued the two in April, claiming that Ms. Hahn broke her
agreement with PTL by talking about her December 1980 meeting with
Bakker at a hotel in Clearwater Beach, Fla.
   Last year, after the PTL scandal broke and Bakker resigned, Ms.
Hahn sold her story _ illustrated with semi-nude photos _ to
Playboy magazine for a reported $1 million.
   Ms. Hahn, who recently moved out of the Playboy Mansion in Los
Angeles and now lives in a hotel there, never replied to the suit.
She and Paul Roper, her representative in the 1985 transaction,
have said they did not realize the money was PTL's, rather than
Bakker's personal money.
   Furstman, a lawyer PTL hired in 1985 to help in dealings with
Ms. Hahn, had responded that he would not contest PTL's claim.
   Under the judge's order, PTL will receive $160,000 _ including
principal and accrued interest _ from a $150,000 trust fund it set
up for Ms. Hahn in February 1985. Furstman will return $39,000 of a
retainer PTL paid him to administer the trust fund.
   After Bakker resigned in March 1987, it was revealed that Bakker
and his wife, Tammy, had received millions of dollars in salaries
and bonuses from PTL. The TV ministry foundered as donations
dwindled, and PTL filed last year for bankruptcy reorganization
with $130 million in debts.
   The Hahn transaction, as well as other of Bakker's financial
dealings at PTL, also are the object of a federal grand jury
investigation in Charlotte into possible tax fraud.
   An IRS report filed in bankruptcy court last December said PTL's
payments related to the Hahn incident included the $150,000 trust
fund; a $115,000 payment given to Roper, who gave $20,000 to Ms.
Hahn; $85,000 in legal fees to Furstman; and $10,000 paid to Ms.
Hahn in 1984 for her signature on a statement absolving Bakker of
wrongdoing.
   Under the agreement with Ms. Hahn, she was to receive monthly
interest from the trust fund for 20 years, after which time she
would receive the $150,000 principal.
   She did receive interest payments from May 1985 until PTL
stopped the payments in March 1987. Her tax returns indicate she
received $10,000 in 1985. She doesn't have to repay that money.

<HEAD>CIA Disputes Report Bush Was CIA Operative in 1960s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The CIA departed from its usual practice of
staying mum on who it employs to dispute a report that Vice
President George Bush was a CIA operative in the early 1960s.
   CIA spokeswoman Sharron Basso said Tuesday that a George William
Bush, who worked the night shift at CIA headquarters during that
period, apparently was the ``Mr. George Bush'' referred to in a
recently discovered FBI memorandum.
   The Nation magazine, in its July 16 issue, had suggested that
the vice president, who was appointed CIA director in 1975 by
President Ford, may have been the person referred to in the 1963
memo by then-FBI director J. Edgar Hoover.
   In that memo to the State Department, Hoover voiced the FBI's
concerns that anti-Castro groups in Miami might use the
assassination of President Kennedy as the rationale for undertaking
an unauthorized raid against Cuba.
   ``The substance of the foregoing information was orally
furnished to Mr. George Bush of the Central Intelligence Agency,''
the Hoover memo stated.
   The magazine article speculated that the vice president used his
Texas oil business as a cover for clandestine CIA activities in the
early 1960s. The vice president denied the report.
   Ms. Basso said that while the agency usually does not confirm or
deny employment or association with the CIA, in this case ``(we)
believe the record should be clarified.''
   Previously, the CIA would not comment on the article or on the
possibility that Bush may have worked for the agency more than a
decade before he became its director.
   Ms. Basso said the other George Bush _ not the George Herbert
Walker Bush who is vice president _ worked on the night watch at
CIA headquarters.
   ``(This) would have been the appropriate place to have received
such an FBI report. This was apparently the George Bush referred to
in (the ``Nation'') article,'' she said.
   George William Bush left the CIA in 1964 to work for the Defense
Intelligence Agency, which he has since left.
   His current whereabouts are unknown, the CIA official said.

<HEAD>An Emotional Night For Jackson Supporters: `He Taught Me a Lesson'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Leonard Tate, a two-time Jesse Jackson
delegate who paraded about the convention floor with his
candidate's photo, placard, and cap, the moment he awaited so long
for took him by surprise.
   He expected fire from Jackson; he saw warmth. He expected anger;
he heard peace.
   And when Jackson finished his Tuesday night address to the
Democratic National Convention, Tate said he learned something new.
   ``He taught me a lesson. I hadn't gotten over my bitterness
(over the vice presidential selection), and I was going to write in
Jesse's name in November,'' Tate said. ``He showed us you've got to
rise above pettiness and revenge and keep your eye on the prize.''
   The speech Jackson delegates had so eagerly awaited turned into
an emotional Sunday sermon for many of them. It began with a flurry
of confetti and ended with a few tears. There were the usual
outbursts that turned the Omni into a sign-waving swirl of red, but
also some personal moments.
   ``It had a lot of heart, a lot of emotion,'' said Bill Gibson of
Greenville, S.C., a delegate and hometown friend of Jackson. ``As a
civil rights activist myself, I see this as a beginning.''
   Jackson retraced the history of the civil rights movement,
repeated some regular campaign themes, talked about his own
background and aspirations and urged his supporters to join with
the majority Dukakis delegates.
   ``The only time we win is when we come together,'' he said.
   Although there was no specific endorsement of the Massachusetts
governor, whose supporters had been instructed to keep their signs
down and let the Jackson followers have center stage, the Jackson
delegates said they got the message.
   ``He kept it upbeat and I think most of the delegates at this
point are ready to pull together. They have got the word from
Jesse,'' said supporter Marva Smalls from South Carolina.
   ``It was very moving. I had to hold back the tears at the end,''
she said.
   ``The man is on target. Nobody can do it better,'' said state
Rep. Al Edwards of Texas.
   Ray Moore, a paper mill worker from Green Bay, Wis., who has
been on strike for 14 months, had tears in his eyes most of the
speech and chanted ``Keep the hope alive'' during the pauses.
   Moore said Jackson's message to his supporters was to ``keep
working as hard as ever'' for Dukakis' election in November.
   ``There's no choice, we've got to,'' Moore said. ``This is the
only ship we have and we have to sail that ship.''
   And for those who hadn't been followers of Jackson, the speech
brought a new understanding to the question, ``What does Jesse
want?''
   ``Jesse Jackson explained to everybody why he runs,'' said Tom
Cain, a white Dukakis delegate from Atlanta.
   ``He runs because of what he once was, not in a negative way but
in a positive way. He wants to be at the table of decisions and
power, for himself and for others,'' he said.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., called Jackson's speech a
``tremendous appeal for unity.''
   And Monique Davis, a black member of the Illinois legislature
from Chicago and Jackson delegate, said she had seen Jackson mature.
   ``Jesse recognizes that America has not learned yet the value of
making a quilt. He let us know that until we do that, we'll
continue to have foreclosed farms and a working underclass. He
turned the country inside out and it saw the ugly insides of its
stomach,'' she said.
   ``I'm so proud of him. I've seen him grow without bitterness
into a statesman that America should be proud of.''

<HEAD>Bush Seeks To Divert A Bit Of The Limelight From The Democratic
Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's unusual attempt to grab headlines
during Michael Dukakis' convention is making Democrats grumble and
sparking a debate about whether it will pay off for the Republican
candidate.
   Ignoring the tradition that you don't campaign while your rival
is crowned as his party's nominee, Vice President Bush sets out
today on an eight-state campaign tour through the Midwest, the
South and Southwest.
   The strategy is not to let Dukakis have a free ride during the
Democratic National Convention and to curb the surge in popularity
ratings he is likely to get from the intense publicity generated
here.
   Republican strategists say Dukakis, modestly ahead in most
polls, could get a 5- to 10-point jump from the convention.
   Bush's trek is timed to give him media exposure during the two
biggest events of the convention _ tonight when Dukakis is
nominated, and on Thursday, when Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is
nominated and Dukakis gives his acceptance speech.
   ``It will have some positive impact,'' said Doug Bailey, a
Washington-based political consultant. ``It means the national TV
nightly news will not be 100 percent totally dominated by the
Democratic convention and Dukakis. That's significant.''
   David Keene, another Washington-area political consultant who
once worked for Bush, said, ``He obviously won't dominate the news.
He can get some visibility, certainly regionally, wherever he is
campaigning.''
   Keene said Bush may have some impact on Dukakis' poll ratings.
``It might hold it a little bit but only marginally, because a
convention is the focal point of public attention. The candidate _
unless the convention is a disaster _ usually gets a boost, usually
a short-term boost.''
   Democrats scoffed at Bush's tactics.
   ``His doing that suggests a sense of desperation and concern
that I'm surprised by,'' said Charles Manatt, former Democratic
national chairman. However, Manatt was quick to add, ``That he'd
break that rule and custom raises questions of whether Dukakis
should do the same.''
   Walter Mondale, the unsuccessful Democratic presidential
candidate four years ago, said Bush's ploy was a sign of weakness.
   ``I don't think he solves that by just campaigning,'' Mondale
said. ``Frenzy is not the same as an answer. And he will have to
deal with that.''
   Norman Ornstein, a political scientist at the American
Enterprise Institute, called Bush's plan ``very unusual and
probably a little foolish.'' He said Bush might dilute Dukakis
message, but that his campaigning will be ``looked on rather
cynically'' by most voters.
   Even Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., was skeptical
about Bush's plan.
   ``All the media's here,'' Dole told an Atlanta news conference,
``So nobody's going to know where he is anyway. So it probably
won't make any difference.''
   Dole and Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., were the advance guard of
another Republican effort to divert the spotlight from Dukakis. On
each day of the convention, GOP leaders are making themselves
available to offer a contrasting view to the Democrats'.
   Rep. Martin said she did not think Bush was playing dirty pool.
   ``The politics is changing, how you do it,'' she said. ``This
isn't how you ran 12 years ago. You're going to see all of them
out, a lot of the time, and I don't believe that is raining on
their parade.''
   Explaining Bush's strategy, campaign manager Lee Atwater said,
``We were roundly criticized for him not being out campaigning on
Monday and Tuesday, and then we've been criticized for having him
out campaigning during the (final days of the) convention.
   ``There's not a single move you can make during a campaign like
that when you aren't criticized by someone. So we just decided to
go ahead and let the vice president run his own campaign and let
the chips fall where they may,'' Atwater said.
   Bush dropped out of sight Saturday on a fishing trip in Wyoming
with James A. Baker III, his longtime friend who is expected to
resign as Treasury secretary next month to run the Bush campaign.
   Tonight, Bush will make two appearances in the Detroit area. On
Thursday, Bush heads for the South, with events in Charlotte, N.C.,
and Greenville, S.C.
   ``Within the region, whatever the locality is, he will get a lot
of attention. So there really is no reason not to do it,'' said
consultant Bailey.
   On Friday, as Dukakis and Bentsen leave the convention in
triumph, Bush will be on the road again, campaigning in Wisconsin
and New Jersey, followed the next day by stops in Tennessee and
Florida, and on Sunday in New Mexico.

<HEAD>After Primping And Prepping, There's Even Concern Over Too Much
Concern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city that says it's ``too busy to hate,''
hates to think people won't like it this week.
   As Atlanta prepared to host the Democratic National Convention,
residents and civic leaders worried about everything from courteous
cabbies to crime to cleanliness. They put up a new park, posted
police on convention-area corners, and even sent cabbies to charm
school.
   Now, at the midpoint of the convention, there's even concern
over too much concern.
   ``We sure will be glad when it's over,'' downtown hotel worker
Michael Johnson said Tuesday as he waited to catch a subway train.
   Michael Lomax, chairman of the Fulton County Commission,
suggested to residents in a newspaper column that ``obsessive
boosterism'' was damaging, and they ``just lighten up and enjoy the
show.''
   ``If there's a tendency to savage Atlanta in print, we certainly
contribute to it by being self-conscious about our appearance, so
preoccupied with making things picture-perfect,'' Lomax said.
   The Atlanta Constitution has been publishing excerpts of other
newspapers' comments on the city (``Downtown Atlanta ... is a
dreadful place'' _ the New York Daily News; ``... Cocky and gawky,
wallowing in self-love and self-doubt...'' _ The Chicago Tribune).
   But at the subway stops and on the street corners, residents
recite the refrain that it's worth it to put up late buses,
gridlock traffic and even bad reviews because the attention
garnered during the four-day affair will boost the city.
   ``I think it's great,'' said Robert Alpert, a downtown
chiropractor. ``The city did a lot of quick repair before the
convention got here, and it's paying off.''
   Still, they worry that something will go wrong while the
Democrats are in town _ something that could smudge the carefully
crafted image Atlanta is trying to project with all the primping
and prepping.
   ``It brought more money to Atlanta. More people are employed
now, even if it is just for a week,'' said Patricia Rush, who's
picked up a part-time security job at the convention site. ``It's
been good, and I think everything will work out all right.''
   Like so many, Ms. Rush is happy to have the convention here, and
a little sad, too.
   ``It's been nothing but hectic this week. The bus service is
slow because all the buses are taking delegates around. They've
blocked off some streets, and it's just a mess,'' she said.
   Johnson, too, is picking up extra money working long hours at
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
   ``In a sense it has brought a smile to the city, and also
frowns,'' said Johnson. ``When you disturb one's bed, you don't
rest.''
   And as far as the extra money he's making, ``I'm too tired to
enjoy it.''

<HEAD>New Cabinet Has Younger Officials, More Native Taiwanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui announced a major
Cabinet reshuffle today, promoting younger officials and native
Taiwanese less than two weeks after he was acclaimed chairman of
the ruling Nationalist Party.
   Lee brought eight new officials into the 25-member Cabinet and
transferred seven members to new posts. He kept Premier Yu Kuo-hwa,
the government's leading conservative.
   The Nationalist Party said in a press release that its
policy-making Central Standing Committee approved the appointments
today. Officials said the new appointees would take office Monday.
   A major Cabinet overhaul was expected after the 13th congress of
the Nationalist Party ended last week. Party personnel changes
showed power shifting from conservatives of the Chiang Kai-shek era
to a younger generation largely comprised of native Taiwanese.
   The Nationalists led by Chiang set up their authoritarian
government in Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist
forces on the Chinese mainland.
   Lee, a 65-year-old native Taiwanese, promised to continue
democratic reform and other liberalization begun in recent years by
his predecessor, Chiang Ching-kuo, the eldest son of Chiang
Kai-shek. Chiang Ching-kuo died in January of heart failure.
   The new Cabinet indicates Lee will continue to move gradually.
   Native Taiwanese hold 11 seats in the new Cabinet, including the
important posts of foreign minister and finance minister, which
always have been held by mainland Chinese.
   This represents an increase of three seats held by native
Taiwanese, who comprise 85 percent of Taiwan's population of nearly
20 million.
   Many new Cabinet members are viewed as technocrats, including
several groomed by Yu and other party conservatives. But observers
believe the new lineup should speed up liberalization of the
state-dominated economic system.
   ``Premier Yu has been under tremendous pressure to reform,''
said Lin An-lo, chief economist at the Chunghwa Institute for
Economic Research. ``We hope he can do better with the cooperation
of the younger Cabinet members.''
   Lee has led calls for reform of the economic and financial
system, but economists say the Nationalist government has moved
slowly to avoid irritating powerful vested interests.
   The Nationalist Party controls Taiwan's banks and many other
large enterprises. Conservative party members generally oppose the
privatization of banks and other businesses and the reform of
taxation, steps that many people say are necessary to bring the
island into the modern global economy.
   Vice Premier Lien Chan, 52, will be the new foreign minister.
   Frederick Chien, 54, Taiwan's representative to Washington, will
replace 73-year-old Chao Yao-tung as head of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development. The announcement did not name a
new representative in Washington. Chen Li-an, 51, chairman of the
National Science Council, will replace 69-year-old Lee Ta-hai as
economic affairs minister.
   Both Lee and Chao would retire.
   Shirley Kuo, 58, deputy governor of the Central Bank, will head
the Finance Ministry, replacing Robert Chien, 59, named the
Cabinet's secretary general.
   The youngest Cabinet member will be Ma Ying-jeou, 38, a party
deputy secretary general, appointed to head the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission.
   Lee also named a scientist, an agricultural expert and an
education administrator to replace three aging officials as
ministers without portfolio.
   Yu formally proposed the new Cabinet, and Lee submitted it to
the party Central Standing Committee after discussions with Yu.

<HEAD>Tacky Times For GOP in Town Geared for Demos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Republicans, getting a message out can be
trying in a town that's geared this week for Democrats. Or at least
a little tacky around the edges.
   ``Did you just save us?'' a worried Barrie Tron asked a
repairman urgently trying to restore electricity to the
``Republican Media Center.''
   He had, and another day's ``truth squad'' session came off as
scheduled, though hardly in the lap of luxury.
   When the National Republican Congressional Committee decided to
trot in top Republicans every day to counter the overwhelming focus
being given to this week's Democratic National Convention, they
quickly learned how much space is at a premium in a town that's
jammed with 35,000 extra people.
   The daily Republican sessions are at a downtown hotel, in a room
that's yet to be finished.
   ``It's the most finished of the unfinished rooms,'' said Tron, a
GOP committee staffer. ``In this case finished means air
conditioned.''
   So each day, the assembled press corps and the day's cast of
Republican luminaries troop into a small room where exposed pipes
dominate the higher reaches. Blue curtains have been hung to
partially cover bare concrete walls and windows that have paper
taped over them.
   When the power failed Tuesday, plunging the room into
semi-darkness, Tron was philosophical. ``We're mood lighting this
one,'' he said as he called for help.
   ``It's the first time I've ever seen a boiler room operation in
a boiler room,'' said one of the participants.
   Still, Tron said, there's room for everybody, and the blue
curtains make a nice backdrop for the television cameras showing up
every day.
   ``Actually, it's a pretty good room,'' he said.
   The daily GOP gathering is hardly the top news of the day, but
it's attracting increased attention, particularly as disputes among
the Democrats are resolved.
   Monday's meeting prompted Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the
Democratic National Committee, to compare the GOP gathering to ants
which inevitably show up at a picnic.
   Rich Galen, a GOP spokesman, quickly got into the swing of
things by firing off a letter to McCurry, accompanied by a
miniature ant farm.
   ``I know when you referred to us as ants, you were complimenting
us on our industriousness,'' Galen wrote. The ant farm was, he
said, ``a token of our appreciation.''
   The Republicans also just happened to land in the hotel where
Jesse Jackson is staying, and that has provided a few interesting
moments.
   During Monday's session thousands of Jackson backers chanted
``Run Jesse Run'' as former White House political strategist Ed
Rollins discussed the impact of the unity agreement between Jackson
and Michael Dukakis, the certain Democratic nominee.
   ``We're just here to give you folks the contrast you need,''
said New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, one of the designated critics
on Tuesday. ``We are here to provide an opportunity for comparison
shopping.''
   ``It's not an effort to be negative, it's an effort to be
comparative,'' Galen said.
   Galen dismissed suggestions that Republicans were trying to rain
on the Democrats' parade, and said he assumed they will dispatch a
similar force to next month's Republican National Convention in New
Orleans.

   More than half the satellite trucks in America
are here for the Democratic convention, beaming nearly non-stop to
places like Japan and White River Junction, Vt., from their parking
spots next to a highway embankment.
   The people who run them are figurative light years away from the
rhetoric, klieg lights and air conditioning of the convention.
   They don't have a bathroom, either.
   ``We're on the other side of the tracks,'' said Emeric Feldman,
an engineer for WCVB in Boston. ``There're 40 trucks and 100 guys
out here and we can't get a port-o-john. There's no water, no
food.''
   He joked: ``We've threatened to boycott, shut the whole thing
down.''
   The 43 trucks lined up on a desolate street at the raw rear
entrance of the Georgia World Congress Center make up the largest
collection of dishes ever assembled in one place. A dozen more are
parked elsewhere in the city.
   Their presence is a boon for the Democrats, providing exposure
far beyond the couple of hours of convention coverage shown nightly
on the networks.
   The trucks and dishes enable local stations to showcase their
own people and generate as much material as their audience will
bear. The party has thoughtfully provided stand-up space for local
reporters inside The Omni convention hall.
   There were only a few satellite trucks at the 1984 conventions.
``They all laughed,'' Feldman recalled. ``They said it would never
work.''
   The satellite park just a few blocks away from the convention
glitz, at once awesome and grim, proves the skeptics definitively
wrong.
   Its three block-long rows of high-tech dish trucks _ Spacelink
and Skylink, Newstar and Livestar, a couple of U-Hauls and Budget
Rent-a-Trucks _ are spectacular in their number if not their
setting.
   ``We've got the sewers on one side and the Dumpsters on the
other,'' said Daryl Hunter, an engineer sent by GTE Spacelink Corp.
to check and repair equipment at this convention within a
convention.
   Along with their space and sky references, the trucks announce
their origins _ New York and Boston, Milwaukee and Winston-Salem,
Kansas City and Little Rock, Washington and Tampa, Springfield and
New Orleans, South Bend and Scranton. And, no kidding, White River
Junction, Vt.
   ``We're still kind of astonished'' to be here, said Keith
Bergstrom, director of satellite operations for WNNE in White River
Junction. ``We're a very small station. We operate out of the
basement of a motel.''
   Feldman, of WCVB in Boston, said his station sent 19 people and,
by network standards, is saturating viewers with convention news _
a half-hour at noon, live updates throughout the afternoon, 90
minutes at 7:30 p.m. in addition to heavy coverage on the 6 p.m.
and 11 p.m. local newscasts. The dish is shared with other stations
including one in Japan, he said.
   With home viewers the key to this year's convention, described
by the party chairman as a four-part mini-series with a live studio
audience, you might expect royal treatment for the dish operators.
But their most elegant amenity so far is an occasional visit by a
canteen truck.
   The work is hot _ especially when a dish goes awry and must be
fiddled with atop the truck. ``I've gone through all my changes of
clothing. I change twice a day and take showers three times a
day,'' said Hunter.
   ``I don't have time to go take showers. Last week I worked 96
hours and this week it'll probably be more,'' said Feldman. ``But
I'm having a ball.''

   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts to the Democratic National
Convention on Tuesday.
   Thank you, John for that moving introduction, and for the joy
you have given our family over the years. Tonight, you have given
something special to this convention and this country. You have
touched deep chords of memory and hope in Democrats and Americans
everywhere. You remind us that we are at our best when we have a
president who asks each of us what we can do for our country.
   For a long time, I have believed that what this country needs is
another president from Massachusetts. And now it's going to happen.
   President Dukakis _ it has a nice ring, doesn't it.
   Some people say _ don't count your chickens before they're
hatched. Well, the Republicans have already hatched their chicken
in this campaign _ and George Bush is a dead duck.
   And that doesn't even count all the other chickens they've
hatched in the past eight years that are coming home to roost on
election day this November.
   We know who and what we are running against. We know them by
their names and by their deeds. They are the party of Ed Meese and
Robert Bork. They are the party of Irangate, Contra-gate,
Pentagon-gate. They are the party that tolerates apartheid abroad
and retreats from civil rights here at home.
   They are the party that talks tough on drugs but deals softly
with drug-running dictators. We have heard the slogan _ ``Just say
no.'' The problem is _ our Republican opponents just couldn't say
``no'' to General Noriega.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: General Noriega.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As Democrats, we know who we are, and where we stand, and what
we seek.
   We are the diversity of America, committed to the ideal that all
of us can advance together _ and none shall be left behind.
   We are the party of change _ and across the generations, we have
seen what our country can become.
   We have never been willing to stand on the sidelines of history.
Whether the issue was war or peace, equality or justice, we have
been at the center of the struggle _ and sometimes we have known
our setbacks and paid a political price. We lost some elections,
but we never lost our soul. And now we know that the struggle has
made us stronger, as this country is ready to move again _ and we
are ready to lead.
   We are strengthened by a vigorous and honorable primary
campaign. We are strengthened by an extraordinary group of
candidates who this spring made all of us proud to be Democrats.
   We are strengthened by the example and the eloquence of one of
the most talented individuals in this nation _ one whose life and
words alike give new meaning to our oldest ideals. He stands for
freedom and compassion, and his effort makes all of us prouder than
ever to be Americans _ the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Most of all, we are strengthened because we will enter this
campaign as the party of hope, the party of both competence and
concern, the party of Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   I know Mike Dukakis. I know his decency and his talent. I know
his spirit. He cares about making government work, because he cares
deeply about people. I have seen the presidency up close _ and I
have seldom seen anyone as matched to the demands and possibilities
of that office as Mike Dukakis.
   Yes, I know Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen as friends _ and I
admire them as leaders. I have faith in them _ faith in Jesse
Jackson. We have a job to do together _ and if all of us are
together, we shall not fail.
   There is a continuity between the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket of 1988
and the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960. It is a continuity of
commitment and not just geography. For Mike Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen, like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, believe that we
cannot be content with things as they are _ that there is a newer
frontier to be crossed _ and a greater society to be built.
   After eight years of complacency and indifference, of problems
untended and pains untreated, it is time to restore purpose and
principle to America.

   Here are highlights of the platform approved by
the Democratic National Convention:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TAXES _ The document does not call for any tax increases, but
says, ``Investing in America and reducing the deficit requires that
the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and that we
restrain Pentagon spending.''
   DEFENSE _ It promises to attack Pentagon waste and promote
``more stable defense budgets.'' Says the Democrats espouse ``a
clear-headed, tough-minded, decisive American foreign policy.''
   EDUCATION _ Talks about ``significantly increasing federal
funding for education.'' Declares that ``the education of our
citizens, from Head Start to institutions of higher learning,
deserves our highest priority.''
   CHILD CARE _ Promises ``major increases in assistance making
child care more available and affordable to low and middle income
families.''
   HEALTH CARE _ Says ``all Americans should enjoy access to
affordable, comprehensive health services.''
   SOCIAL SECURITY _ Promises the system will be ``safeguarded
against emasculation and privatization.''
   TRADE _ Promises to seek ``to export more American goods and
fewer American jobs.''
   CORPORATIONS _ Vows to halt ``such irresponsible corporate
conduct as unproductive takeovers, monopolistic mergers, insider
training, and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating
our anti-trust and securities laws.''
   DRUGS _ Calls for a ``national drug `czar' to halt both the
international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs.''
Would strengthen enforcement and education efforts.
   CRIME _ Backs a ban on ``cop killer'' bullets.
   WOMEN _ Supports an Equal Rights Amendment, and ``the
fundamental right of reproductive choice ... regardless of ability
to pay.''
   HOMELESS _ Says the Democrats will act ``to ensure a decent
place to live for every American,'' and an end to the ``national
shame'' of homelessness. Promises to expand the supply of
affordable housing and assist first-time homebuyers.
   LAYOFFS _ Calls for advance notice of plant closings.
   AIDS _ Would expand research and education about the disease,
while protecting victims' civil rights.
   VOTING _ Endorses ``universal, same-day and mail-in voter
registration.''
   ARMS TALKS _ Calls for ``mutual, verifiable and enforceable
agreements that will make significant reductions in strategic
weapons.'' Also calls for ``a mutual moratorium on missile flight
testing.''
   COLD WAR _ Urges that the new administration take ``advantage of
what may be the greatest opportunity of our lifetime to establish a
new, mutually beneficial relationship with the Soviet Union.''
   MIDDLE EAST _ Says the Democrats will ``provide new leadership
to deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations
that has been held out to Israel and its neighbors by the Camp
David Accord.''
   CENTRAL AMERICA _ Backs the Arias peace plan.
   SOUTH AFRICA _ Promises ``to declare South Africa a terrorist
state (and) to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its economy.''
   LEBANON and PERSIAN GULF _ Supports ``the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon,'' and backs
United Nations efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war through an arms
embargo.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: to America.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   From Atlanta to Seattle, from Houston to Boston, everywhere in
our land, there are men and women willing to work who deserve a
chance to work. There are children to be taught, families to be
housed, farms to be saved, diseases to be cured, hungry to be fed,
homeless to be cared for, and justice to be done.
   And in the larger world, from the Persian Gulf to Central
America, from the Soviet Union to South Africa, there are wars to
be halted, arms to be reduced, families to be united, human rights
to be defended, and apartheid to be ended.
   President Reagan deserves credit for the Moscow summit. But I
wish that just once this president would speak as forcefully for
civil rights in the United States as he does for human rights in
the Soviet Union.
   But at least Ronald Reagan accepts the blame as well as the
credit for the policies of the past eight years. He comes without
excuses and equivocation. He stands up, looks us in the eye. But
not George Bush _ who on question after question, keeps burying his
head in his hands and hiding from the record of the Reagan-Bush
mistakes.
   The vice president says he wasn't there _ or can't recall _ or
never heard _ as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms
to Iran. So when that monumental mistake was being made, I think it
is fair to ask _ where was George?
   The vice president says he never saw _ or can't remember _ or
did not comprehend _ the intelligence report on General Noriega's
involvement in the cocaine cartel. So when that report was being
prepared and discussed, I think it's fair to ask _ where was George?
   The vice president claims he cares about the elderly _ but
evidently he didn't know, or wasn't there, when the Administration
tried repeatedly to slash Social Security and Medicare. So when
those decisions were being made, I think it's fair to ask _ where
was George?
   And the Vice President, who now speaks fervently of civil
rights, apparently wasn't around or didn't quite hear when the
administration was planning to weaken voting rights, give tax
breaks to segregated schools, and veto the Civil Rights Restoration
Act. So when all those assaults were being mounted, I think it's
fair to ask _ where was George?
   In fact, the vice president even _ We all know, we all know the
answer to all these questions. George Bush is the man who is never
there. And he won't be there after the clock strikes noon on
January 2Oth, 1989.

   His only major economic proposal is a wonderfully Republican
idea to cut the capital gains tax for the rich. That may be good
for his friends who clip coupons _ but the hard-working taxpayers
of this country cannot afford to be clipped again by another round
of ``voodoo economics.''
   I wonder who coined that phrase?
   America needs more shelters for the homeless _ not more tax
shelters for the privileged.
   America needs more affordable housing for the middle class, not
more tax breaks for the upper class.
   America needs to bring the disabled into the mainstream and not
relegate whole groups of our people to the backwaters of our
economy.
   The next administration must do more than provide comfort for
the comfortable. And the next president must offer more than a pale
imitation of a Reaganism whose time has faded.
   A new century is dawning; the old order is changing. We must
look beyond the next election to the horizon of the next
generation. And there is no one better matched to the challenge
than Mike Dukakis. He saw the future coming in Massachusetts. He
led the transition from a faltering 1950s economy to a modern
economy at the cutting edge of change. Mike Dukakis is the man who
did it for Massachusetts _ and Mike Dukakis is the man who is going
to do it for the United States of America.
   George Bush may want to lower the capital gains tax. But Mike
Dukakis will repeal the corruption tax we are all paying _ in the
form of defense cost over-runs _ and a Pentagon bribery scandal
that has bloated the budget by billions of dollars. So let's not
raise taxes on average-income families; let's lower the boom on
high level corruption.
   The years ahead can be a bad time _ or the best of times. The
problem today is not America's people, but America's leadership.

<HEAD>ATLANTA: America's leadership.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Our people know the difference between right and wrong. We all
see the faces pressed against the windows of our affluence. And we
wonder now whether our children will be consigned to a lesser life
in a lesser land.
   We cannot be satisfied to see American students rank l5th among
the industrial nations in science and math.
   We must strengthen education _ not attack it.
   We must abolish illiteracy, not abide it.
   We must invest in Star Schools here on earth, not Star Wars in
the heavens.
   And we must heed the message of Jesse Jackson. We must banish
drugs from our classrooms, from our playgrounds, from the streets
of our cities, and from everywhere in our nation.
   We must make America once again the best educated society in the
world. We must see to it that in the 1990s, young Americans won't
just go to school _ they will learn in school.
   At the same time, we must respond to the human realities of a
day as distant from the New Deal as that era was from the age of
the horse and buggy. Today, when more than 50 percent of mothers
work, including half of those with children under the age of one,
it is a national disgrace that we have failed to secure basic child
care for working parents. No mother who wants to work, or has to
work, should have to fear for the health or safety of her child
when she is on the job.
   Nor shall we ever consent to the permanent division of our
nation into three societies _ one doing well, a second barely
holding on, the third trapped decade after decade in hopelessness,
anger and violence.
   All this _ and more _ will be decided at the desk of the next
president. A world transformed takes many different forms. There
are dangers and other challenges. But there is one of which I
finally speak _ and which must be one of the first priorities of
the next administration.
   All my public life, I have fought my heart out for the principle
that the state of a family's health should never be determined by
the size of a family's wealth. And I stand here this evening and
tell you that at long last, victory is within our grasp.
   The first critical step has already been taken this year in
Massachusetts. Governor Dukakis passed comprehensive,
cost-effective access to medical care for every citizen of our
state.

   And next year, in Washington, President Dukakis will wage and
win the battle to secure decent health care for all the people of
our nation.
   I will be standing there with him, in the forefront of that
battle _ because America should not be the only industrial nation
on earth, except for South Africa, that insures the health of its
politicians, but not its people.
   In closing, in closing, let me pledge every resource of mind and
spirit that I have to the success of our cause in 1988. You and I
have stood together many times _ but no time has been more
important than this. The campaign that stretches before us now is a
struggle for the soul and the future of America.
   For we are more than a political coalition _ more than a
collection of programs _ more than the sum of our prospects and our
strategies. Most of all, we are the trustees of a dream.
   Twenty years ago, in 1968, we lost two of the most powerful
voices of that dream. But they left us their vision, their values,
and the hopes they awakened in the countless millions of people
whose hearts they touched. We remember them now to remind ourselves
that the American journey is unfinished _ that we stand for change
in order to march again towards enduring ideals _ that we do not
have to settle for things as they are.
   Martin Luther King, Jr. told us something we need to hear anew.
He said, ``We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today.
We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In the unfolding
of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late.'' And
Dr. King also said: ``We must work unceasingly to lift this nation
to a higher destiny, to a new plateau of compassion.''
   And in that time, there was another voice, only briefly heard,
but whose words too have outlasted all the loss and years. Robert
Kennedy said: ``Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to
improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he
sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a
million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build
a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and
resistance.''
   He was my brother. But he and Dr. King were also, in the deepest
sense, brothers to us all.
   These two, these valiant two, lived for the same dream and were
gone only months apart. And if they were here with us, two decades
later, I think I know what they would say:
   Now is the time. Some men see things as they are and say why. We
dream things that never were and say why not. Now is the time.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her bus seat
to a white man in 1955 helped launch the civil rights movement, was
given a place of honor during Jesse Jackson's speech to the
Democratic National Convention.
   Jackson, who escorted the former Montgomery, Ala., seamstress
into the jam-packed convention hall Tuesday night, called her ``the
mother of the civil rights movement.''
   Jackson introduced her at the beginning of his speech to the
convention. As she smiled and waved, many in the crowd chanted
``Rosa, Rosa, Rosa.''
   Mrs. Parks, now 75, was arrested when she refused to give up her
seat to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, which in
1955 required blacks by law to sit in the back.
   Jackson called Mrs. Parks an inspiration.
   ``She struck the first blow for freedom,'' said Jackson. ``She
was a moral challenge to all of us.''
   With her arrest, Montgomery blacks launched a boycott of the bus
system, and a young local preacher, the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., soon became the boycott's leader.
   The year-long boycott brought King to national prominence and
led to voting rights and equal rights struggles across Alabama and
the South.
   Jackson, in his speech, also invoked the memories of others who
lost their lives during the years of racial upheaval.
   He mentioned Jimmy Lee Jackson, an Alabama black man, and Viola
Liuzo, a white Detroit housewife, who were killed during the 1965
voting rights effort in Alabama, and the four black girls killed in
a Birmingham church bombing during that period of Ku Klux Klan
violence.

   Jesse Jackson's five children praised him as an
idealistic public servant who taught them to have hope and
principles. The youngest told Democratic convention delegates that
``if I could vote, I'd vote for my dad.''
   Jesse Jackson Jr., 23, introduced his father Tuesday night as
``the next president of the United States.''
   ``I bring to you a man who fights against the odds, who lives
against the odds, who brings prisoners home from foreign lands
against the odds, who was born against the odds,'' he said. ``My
father is an odds-buster. The next president of the United States,
our dad, Jesse Jackson.''
   The Jackson children made brief remarks before delegates saw a
videotape of the candidate and heard his 49-minute speech.
   ``The whole world is counting on us to select ... leadership
that measures success by how many people we serve, not by how many
millionaires we create,'' said Santita Jackson, 24, who works on
Capitol Hill in Washington. ``Leadership like that comes in the
form of my father.''
   Yusef, 17, entering the University of Virginia this fall, said
many of his contemporaries ``have tried to spell relief d-r-u-g-s
instead of l-o-v-e. My father, being the general in the war on
drugs, has offered us a way out. He's given us inspiration and a
new direction.''
   ``My father has given me what I think is the most valuable gift.
He has put confidence back in the belief that all things can be
achieved,'' said Jonathan, 22, a recent graduate of North Carolina
Agricultural and Technological University, his father's alma mater.
   ``To many, he is a hero. To us, he is also our father,'' Jesse
Jr. said. ``From him we have learned that when confronted with
challenge and controversy, we must stand up for the things that we
believe in.''
   Jacqueline, 12, made a brief but eloquent pitch. ``If I could
vote, I'd vote for my dad,'' she said. ``He has made a difference.''

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis will be campaigning on a
Democratic platform so brief that some voters might actually read
it _ and so generalized that even if they do it probably won't hurt
his ticket.
   Both are departures from the book-length platforms Democrats had
taken to writing in efforts to cater to every faction in their
coalition. That kind of platform-making was futile at best, and
what they said was sometimes used against them.
   They produced catalogues of promises which Republican
campaigners cited as evidence that the Democrats were committed to
spiraling spending and beholden to special interests.
   It never did them much good. Nobody elects platforms, which are
widely ignored, even by the candidates who theoretically run on
them. Presidents Jimmy Carter in 1980 and Gerald R. Ford in 1976
both accepted platform planks they opposed rather than risk
convention votes they might have lost.
   The platform episodes were quickly forgotten. So, for that
matter, were the platforms.
   Ford lost to Carter in the 1976 election, and Carter to
President Reagan in 1980, but not because of platforms or platform
concessions.
   The Dukakis departure from the wordy promises of the recent
Democratic past actually was the handiwork of Democratic National
Chairman Paul Kirk, who urged long before the primary campaign that
the 1988 platform be a broad statement of principles, not a wish
list for interest groups.
   His plan was to avoid the kind of baggage lugged by past
Democratic tickets. It succeeded. The new platform is a 4,500-word
statement of Democratic tenets, longer on rhetoric than on
specifics. It carries no price tag and defies any effort to compute
one.
   Republicans are trying to paint Dukakis in liberal colors, but
the Democratic platform is no help. GOP campaign spokesmen said the
Democrats are just trying to cloak their liberal intentions.
   ``It is the tax and spend wing that is in control,'' said Gov.
John Sununu of New Hampshire. ``They have written a platform that
attempts to hide that.'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia said the
voters have ``a right to know what is being concealed behind the
vague generalities.'' South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said the
Democrats were trying to shield Dukakis from the liberal tag and
``pulling together to help perpetuate the fraud.''
   Vice President George Bush has argued that theme since it became
clear that Dukakis would be the Democratic nominee.
   But the Democratic platform will supply scant ammunition.
Michael Barnes, the former Maryland congressman who worked on the
platform for Dukakis, said nothing in the document ``would in any
way commit the next Congress or commit the next president, even
theoretically'' to any specific spending program.
   Nor does the platform seek tax increases on business and the
wealthy, as Jesse Jackson supporters wanted. Republicans never let
Walter F. Mondale forget his 1984 convention statement that if he
were elected, taxes would have to be increased. They will argue
that a Dukakis administration means higher taxes, but they'll have
to make the case without a specific target this time.
   Democratic platforms had been growing wordier for 20 years. They
also had become increasingly explicit in their promises,
particularly on expensive domestic programs. Republicans won four
of the five presidential elections during those years.
   By 1984, the platform was a 45,000 word compendium of
compromises and commitments that played into the GOP strategy of
calling the Democratic ticket a liberal captive of countless
factions and interests.
   In 1980, then-President Carter had to capitulate and accept a
set of platform planks advocated by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, among
them a commitment to a $12 billion public service jobs program.
   Challenger Kennedy was short of the votes it would have taken to
deny Carter renomination, but the president didn't want to risk
convention defeat on the platform. So he surrendered _ and then
announced that he accepted only the intent, not the specifics, of
the convention-approved platform planks. It was an overnight issue.
After that, nobody noticed the discrepancy.
   Four years earlier, the Republican platform effectively
renounced the foreign policy of the Republican administration.
Ronald Reagan challenged Ford for the nomination that year, and
came close. Ford strategists feared a platform confrontation might
shake their grip on the nomination itself. So they gave the Reagan
side its way on the foreign policy plank. It made no difference.
   That's the story of party platforms. They don't really help
candidates and they can arm opponents.
   Hence the Democrats' streamlined new look.
   Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, a Jackson negotiator on the
platform, said the Democrats' 1988 handiwork is ``brief, readable
and understandable,'' like the Gettysburg Address and the Ten
Commandments.
   Any comparison ends there. The political world will little note
nor long remember its phrases. And the platform includes few
commandments. The Democrats were purposefully vague about what they
shalt or shalt not do.

   Delegates remembering the spirit of John F.
Kennedy cheered wildly as the late president's son made his
political debut with a prime-time speech before the Democratic
National Convention.
   ``So many of you came into public service because of him. In a
very real sense, because of you, he is still with us,'' John F.
Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday night.
   The handsome, 27-year-old law student, still remembered by many
as the 3-year-old who stood by his mother's side and saluted his
slain father's casket in 1963, mounted the convention podium to
introduce his uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``I'm not a political leader, but I can speak for those of my
age who've been inspired by Teddy to give their energy and their
ideas to their community and not just themselves,'' Kennedy said.
``He has shown that our hope is not lost idealism but a realistic
possibility.''
   The senator embraced his nephew and told the audience that John
Jr. should ``remind us that we are at our best when we have a
president who asks each of us what we can do for our country.''
   ``You have touched deep chords of memory and hope in Democrats
and Americans everywhere,'' the senator told John Jr. ``Tonight,
you have given something special to this convention and this
country.''
   The appearance by Kennedy, a third-year law student at New York
University, triggered speculation that he might be the next Kennedy
to entire politics. During most of his life he has carefully
avoided both publicity and politics.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, who introduced young Kennedy to the
eager audience, called him ``a young man whom we all clasped to our
hearts and whom we will love today as we have in the past, and whom
we will come to love in the future.''
   Kennedy received a thunderous standing ovation and his
two-minute speech was interrupted six times by applause.

Victory</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., for
years the leader and symbol of liberal Democratic politics, now
says he and the party drifted too far to the left.
   The Massachusetts Democrat known as ``Tip'' on Tuesday applauded
efforts by Michael Dukakis and others to pull the party closer to
the political center.
   ``We really got too far off to the left, to be perfectly
truthful, and I was one of those who were out there,'' O'Neill said.
   ``For years, the old liberal wing of the party tried to control
the party lock, stock and barrel, and because of that we lost an
awful lot of people,'' he said. ``Politics is the art of
compromise. You have to have a voice on both sides.''
   Today, O'Neill said, the Democratic Party is much more
diversified. ``We have everybody from every element _
economic-wise, ethnic-wise, regional-wise, and that's the way it
was back in the '30s when we were developing America.''
   O'Neill, 75, who retired in 1986 after 50 years in politics, the
last 34 in the House, is here as a super delegate from
Massachusetts.
   Speaking informally to reporters at a Massachusetts delegation
breakfast sponsored by Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., O'Neill said he
is confident Michael Dukakis would win in November.
   ``I have never, at least in 28 years since Jack Kennedy, seen
the party as united as we are right now,'' the former speaker said.
``There's no question this ticket is going to bring us victory.''
   Although he has been out of office for 1{ years, O'Neill remains
the consummate politician, stopping to chat at the convention with
dozens of fans and have his photo taken with them, treating each
like a long-lost friend with a genuine ``how are you, dear.''
   Some other convention insights from O'Neill:
   _ On Jesse Jackson: ``He knows he's made a place in history.''
   _ On platform fights: ``You need these to stimulate the
convention. Not only that, they bring out the minority views that
are expressed and the people should know about them.''
   _ On keynote speaker Ann Richards: ``I don't think a man could
get away with saying what she said, to be perfectly truthful, but
she said it beautifully. She was great, absolutely fantastic.''

<HEAD>Platform Adopted Without Controversial Amendments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proud Democrats say their no-frills platform
offers ``a blueprint for a better America'' without serving as a
storehouse of ammunition for Republican rivals.
   The convention shouted enthusiastic approval of the platform
Tuesday night after soundly rejecting Jesse Jackson's call for
higher taxes on the wealthy and no U.S. first use of nuclear
weapons. They also approved a raft of less controversial amendments
agreed to by Jackson and Michael Dukakis.
   There also was a carefully staged debate on Jackson's call for
Palestinian self-determination, but by prior agreement the Jackson
forces withdrew that minority plank before a vote was taken.
   An exultant Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, who chaired the
Platform Committee, said, ``Tonight, the Democratic party unites
enduring values with new ideas to present a blueprint for a better
America.''
   ``Our platform offers challenges to put aside the selfishness,
scandal and stagnation of the past eight years and to rekindle once
again the values and spirit of our great American family,''
Blanchard said.
   Rep. Robert Matsui of California, who helped write it, said:
``This platform is for our children. ... This is a document for the
future of America.''
   Despite concessions, there is nothing in the platform to give
Dukakis any concern, said former Rep. Michael Barnes of Maryland,
the prospective nominee's chief platform negotiator. The document
is devoid of specific budget promises.
   ``We wanted to maintain a platform on which he could very
comfortably campaign and, frankly, which could help to unite the
party and which Democrats across the country could comfortably
campaign on,'' said Barnes.
   In the past, many Democratic candidates have complained that an
ultra-liberal party platform was an albatross around their necks at
election time.
   The Dukakis delegates defeated by 2,499 to 1,091.5 Jackson's
``fair tax'' plank, which called for raising taxes on the wealthy
and on corporations back to pre-Reagan levels. There were 90
abstentions.
   On the effort to rule out first use of nuclear weapons, the
Jackson forces picked up a few more delegates _ including Sen.
Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. But that proposed plank also was rejected on
the only other recorded vote, 2,474.1 to 1,220.6, with 67
abstentions.
   As promised, the Palestinian plank never came to a vote. But
James Zogby, executive director of the Arab-American Institute,
expressed satisfaction that the issue at least could be debated.
   ``The deadly silence that submerged the issue of Palestinian
rights has been shattered ... ,'' he said. ``We don't need votes.''
   As Zogby spoke, supporters paraded a 30-foot banner reading
``Self-Determination and Statehood for the Palestinian People.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii called the Jackson language on the
Middle East plank ``a vicious kick in the teeth of America's
interests in that part of the world.''
   On Jackson's tax plank, Denver Mayor Fredrico Pena said, ``I
don't like throwing softballs to an opponent to knock out of the
park and a tax hike pitch is a grand slam for George Bush.''
   The platform ran barely 5.000 words with the amendments.
   Titled ``The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of
Hope,'' it mentions neither Ronald Reagan or George Bush, but
promises to reverse ``voodoo economics,'' help the homeless and
needy, improve education and maintain ``more stable defense
budgets.''
   The platform is barely one-eighth the length of the Democrats'
1984 declaration of principles, and the shortest since the terse
platforms that Franklin D. Roosevelt rode to victory in the 1930s.

<HEAD>Billy Graham Says Robertson Should Have Remained a Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Rev. Billy Graham cited Jesse Jackson and Pat
Robertson as examples of how members of the clergy should and
should not campaign for public office.
   Jackson's presidential candidacy has demonstrated that clergymen
can seek public office and take strong moral stands without
mingling religion with politics, Graham said Tuesday.
   On the other hand, he said: ``If Pat Robertson made a major
mistake, it was when he renounced his ordination. I think even the
people who followed him, or people who didn't follow him, would
have a hard time understanding how a man could be called of God,
ordained of God _ and you're ordained for life _ and to renounce
it.''
   Robertson made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican
presidential nomination. Graham, who says he's not taking sides,
delivered the invocation at Tuesday's session of the Democratic
National Convention.

<HEAD>Jackson Extends Prime Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It went an hour beyond the end of prime time, but
there was no way the networks were going to cut away once the
show's star, Jesse Jackson, took center stage on the second night
of the Democrats' made-for-TV convention.
   Jackson didn't even get to the podium until 10:55, but the
networks stayed with him until well after his 50-minute speech
brought down the house. Prime time this time went well beyond its
normal 11 p.m. EDT closeoff.
   Jackson's stemwinder followed another enormously telegenic event
_ the first major public appearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., who
introduced a speech by his uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy. The elder
Kennedy's address would have been the evening's highlight itself if
not for Jackson's long-awaited outpouring of emotion later in the
evening.
   ABC had the foresight to have on hand those famous photos of
``John-John'' crawling under his father's desk in the Oval Office,
and saluting as Kennedy's funeral procession departed the church.
   NBC's Connie Chung grabbed an exclusive interview with young
Kennedy as he left the podium. He said he had been nervous, but
that it felt pretty good standing up there.
   As for Uncle Ted, there seemed to be some split opinions among
the network commentators as to his future with the Democratic
Party. CBS' Walter Cronkite suggested that he should not be counted
out of the running for a future nomination. ABC's Sam Donaldson had
the opposite view.
   ``I don't think he's ever going to be president _ because of you
know what,'' he told Peter Jennings, in a reference to
Chappaquiddick.
   Despite the appearance by the Kennedy clan, the networks were
just eaten up with anticipation over the impending appearance by
Jackson, finally getting his big moment before the convention.
   ``It's Michael Dukakis' convention, but this is Jesse Jackson's
night to shine,'' said CBS' Dan Rather, who later touted Jackson's
appearance as something of a historical event.
   ``If you want to gather the children around the television set
or get grandmother from the other room, it's coming up in about 15
to 20 minutes,'' he offered helpfully.
   ``Better fasten your seatbelts,'' NBC's Tom Brokaw warned as
Jackson arrived on the podium.
   Jackson's speech was delayed by a series of speeches on such
weighty platform issues as national defense and taxation, speeches
the networks judged too boring for national television audiences.
   ABC carried an interview with George Bush's campaign manager
instead. NBC continued discussing whether Jackson would get into
prime time. Viewers who wanted to see lesser-known speakers talk
about the issues had to turn to C-SPAN, though CBS and CNN did
carry a portion of the speech on the economy by Rep. William Gray
III, D-Pa.
   During Jackson's lengthy address, NBC boasted some eloquent
camera work, doing slow dissolves of reaction shots, the faces
black, white, brown, young, old. NBC also had a nice cutaway to
Jackson's guest on the podium, Rosa Parks.
   There was pandemonium after the speech as network floor
reporters rushed to grab an interview. ABC's Sam Donaldson and CBS'
Ed Bradley were part of the crush of an impromptu news conference.
   Chung, NBC's podium reporter, could be seen struggling in the
background, out of microphone reach. She finally nabbed Jackson.
But shortly into their interview, he started giving
uncharacteristically curt answers. Chung seemed perplexed. Finally
the Reverend whispered over his shoulder, ``Right now they're
prayin'.'' Up on the podium, the closing prayer was under way.

   Television producers complained Tuesday that the Democratic
Party was literally leaving them in the dark at times during
prime-time convention hours by dimming the lights below previously
agreed-upon levels.
   ``They're dimming them much more than they said they would,''
said pool producer Charlie Frey. ``We get into the actual show
itself and it's like a Las Vegas production.''
   Frey said light levels were set in advance. But Democratic
National Committee officials during speeches lowered the lights,
making it difficult for network cameras to get reaction shots of
delegates, he said.
   ``It's their convention and they can do what they want to do,''
Frey said. ``They control the lights, but we agreed on a level and
they're varying from it.''
   A DNC spokesman said officials familiar with the lighting
arrangements were unavailable for comment.

<HEAD>Police And Workers Clash In Strike To Protest Austerity Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people stayed away from work and
school, strikers blocked roads with rocks and bonfires and police
responded with tear gas and water cannon during a 48-hour general
strike that ends today.
   Clashes between police and protesters on Tuesday left at least
five people injured and nearly 300 arrested.
   The strike was called to protest austerity measures imposed this
month, including food price increases ranging from 20 percent to
100 percent.
   Meanwhile, Shining Path guerrillas killed seven policemen and
wounded five others in two attacks Monday and Tuesday on police
posts in Peru's eastern jungle. Police said they did not know if
the attacks were strike-related.
   Leftist guerrillas supporting the work stoppage launched bomb
attacks on buildings in several Peruvian cities, including one in
Lima that wounded three passers-by, officials said.
   Prime Minister Armando Villanueva called Tuesday's strike a
failure and said just 30 percent of Peru's factories and businesses
were affected.
   But strike leader Alberto Ramirez said 80 percent of factories,
stores and businesses in Lima were shut down by the strike Tuesday
and a slightly smaller percentage closed nationwide.
   The strike cut Lima bus transportation Tuesday by 50 percent,
and most banks and government offices in downtown Lima opened late
and were understaffed, officials said. School attendence was low
and about half the shops and stores in downtown Lima were closed.
   Radio Programas, Peru's leading news station, said business
activity fell dramatically in the key highand capitals of Huancayo,
Cuzco and Puno, and interstate trucking was virtually halted
nationwide.
   It was the third general strike against the 3-year-old
government of President Alan Garcia, head of the governing
center-left Aprista Party.
   The strike was called by the General Confederation of Peruvian
Workers, which claims to represent 90 percent of Peru's 1.6 million
unionized workers, and was endorsed by the Marxist United Left, the
nation's second strongest political party.
   The government charged the strike was politically motivated,
declared it illegal and ordered 8,000 police and soldiers to guard
capital streets and ride buses to ensure workers got to their jobs.
   Strikers Tuesday repeatedly blocked main arteries leading into
Lima, and police said they arrested 220.
   Police arrested about 60 strikers in provincial capitals.
Ramirez claimed four people were wounded by police gunfire.
   Police said a 10-year-old boy was injured by a tear gas canister
in Huancayo, 125 miles east of Lima.
   An indefinite strike by miners entered its second day Tuesday,
paralyzing most mining across the nation, strike officials said.

<HEAD>Teens Caught in Carl Rowan's Back Yard Agree to Community Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. attorney's office dropped unlawful
entry charges against two teen-agers involved in a shooting
incident last month at the home of syndicated columnist Carl Rowan
after the teens agreed to perform community service.
   Benjamin N. Smith, 18, and Laura A. Bachman, 19, agreed to
perform 40 hours of community service because of their involvement
in the June 14 incident in which they swam uninvited in Rowan's
back yard pool, officials said Tuesday.
   Rowan, a well-known advocate of gun control, wounded one of the
youths with an unregistered handgun.
   Rowan said he was awakened at 1:55 a.m. by the sound of someone
at his bedroom window and the sight of four people in his pool.
After he called police, Rowan armed himself with a handgun he said
his son, a former FBI agent, gave him during a time when he was
receiving death threats.
   Rowan said he shot Smith, 18, of Chevy Chase, Md., in the wrist
near his doorway after Smith lunged at him. Rowan said he warned
Smith to stop and told him he had a gun. The youth was treated at
an area hospital and released.
   The columnist said when he confronted Smith, the youth was
smoking what Rowan suspected was marijuana.
   Police said Rowan's gun was not registered with the city. The
columnist said his son bought the weapon when he was with the FBI
and was told by city authorities that it did not have to be
registered.
   Although Tuesday's hearing in D.C. Superior Court completes the
case with Smith and Bachman, it is still not known if Rowan will
face charges for having an unregistered handgun and ammunition.
   On June 23, the U.S. attorney's office refused to press charges
against Rowan and referred the case to the District of Columbia
corporation counsel's office.
   Beverly Burke, spokeswoman for that office, said the case was
still under investigation and that ``something will be done in the
next couple weeks.''
   Smith's parents, Neil and Dinah Smith, refused comment on
Tuesday's hearing.
   Court officials have not revealed what type of community service
the two teens will perform over the next four months.

<TEXT>
   It isn't just in theoretical terms that the
television networks are forfeiting coverage of the national
conventions to cable TV, at least according to A.C. Nielsen ratings
for the first night of the Democrats' 1988 meeting.
   Ratings for the three major networks' coverage has been on a
slide since 1980. Ratings for Cable News Network, though still
small, are up 25 percent in 1988 over 1984.
   C-SPAN has also become a player, although the extent of its
audience is not known because it has no advertising and is
therefore not rated.
   For Monday night's coverage, NBC had a 6.2 rating and 11 share.
It began at 8:30 p.m. EDT, a half-hour earlier than CBS and ABC.
CBS had a 5.8 and 11 share, and ABC a 5.7 and 10. All three major
networks signed off shortly after 11 p.m.
   CNN had a 2.0 rating and a 3.3 share for its gavel-to-gavel
coverage.
   For the networks, the rating is a percentage of the nation's
estimated 88.6 million households with television sets and the
share is a percentage of sets in use. For CNN, the rating is a
percentage of households in the cable markets where CNN is
available, roughly half of the total U.S. television homes.
   In 1984, the Democratic convention had a rating of 8.4 on CBS,
7.7 on ABC and 7.1 on NBC. The 1980 convention rated a 9.6 on NBC,
9.5 on CBS and 8.0 on ABC. The rating in 1984 for CNN's coverage
was a 1.6.
   The highest rated Democratic convention since the events have
been televised was the tumultuous 1968 convention in Chicago. It
had a rating of 16.1 on NBC, 14.1 on CBS and 8.5 on ABC.
   C-SPAN, which is carrying the convention sessions uninterrupted
by commentary, has a potential audience of 38 million households
and estimates its ``loyal audience'' at about 3 million viewers.
   ``Because most of our viewers are political junkies, we assume
we're having our biggest audience during convention time,'' said
C-SPAN spokeswoman Nan Gibson.

<HEAD>Workman's Failure Blamed For 1987 Amtrak Derailment In Iowa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are blaming the October
1987 derailment of an Amtrak passenger train in Iowa on a workman's
failure to restore a track switch to its proper position.
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday concluded in
its report that the accident occurred when a laborer parked
maintenance equipment on a siding and failed to reset the switch
for through-traffic use.
   Two locomotives and 11 of 14 passenger cars of Amtrak's
``California Zephyr'' collided with maintenance equipment on the
side track, injuring 15 crew members and 107 of the 230 passengers
aboard.
   The board also blamed the crane operator and a track foreman for
failing to check the switch and criticized the management of the
Burlington Northern Railroad, which owns the track, for inadequate
training of maintenance crews and not reducing the track speed in
the work area.

   An air traffic controller from New York has
been elected president of the new National Air Traffic Controllers
Association in balloting that stretched over several week.
   R. Steve Bell is the controllers' first union president since
the 1981 strike in which 11,400 controllers were fired and their
old union destroyed.
   Bell, who was hired as a controller after the 1981 strike,
received 1,948 votes compared with 1,138 for his chief rival, Fred
Gilbert of Chicago.
   The National Air Traffic Controllers Association was formed last
year as a successor to the Professional Air Traffic Controllers
Association (PATCO), which went backrupt after its unsuccessful
1981 strike. The new union claims about 5,000 members, about 40

<HEAD>Government Defends Pre-Publication Censorship Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. attorney representing the State
Department told a federal judge that regulations requiring
employees to submit their articles to a censor before publication
serve to safeguard foreign policy and national security interests.
   At a hearing Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, assistant U.S. attorney William Dempster said the State
Department's pre-publication regulations are designed to help keep
employees from violating the law or jeopardizing security.
   At issue in the case is an article written by Voice of America
employee Carolyn Weaver that is scheduled to appear in the
September-October issue of the Columbia Journalism Review.
   Ms. Weaver said in an affidavit that the article details
political abuses by the VOA, including ``the apparent illegal use
of VOA programs for covert activity.'' Her attorney, Stephen M.
Kohn, told the court that the regulation requiring her to submit
the article to a censor prior to publication ``is too broad ...
goes too far.''
   Jackson took the case under advisement.

   An Alabama legislator apologized to the state's
Democratic National Convention delegation for saying on a national
television program that he favored racially segregated schools.
   But state Sen. Earl Goodwin of Selma said Tuesday his comment
was taken out of context when it was broadcast on the
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.
   Elizabeth Brackett, correspondent for the public television
program, said later that Goodwin's remark was a small part of a
longer interview but that it was not presented out of context.
   In the Monday night segment featuring the Alabama convention
delegation, Goodwin was shown commenting, ``My philosophy of the
things that I think _ the separation of the races has been for the
good of the country.''
   Goodwin, a white retired businessman and longtime ally of frmer
Gov. George Wallace, said he was talking about the landmark 1954
Brown vs. Board ruling in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down
the ``separate but equal'' doctrine in public schools.
   He said he favored segregated school systems, with improved
conditions for blacks, rather than the desegregation set into
motion by the Brown ruling.
   He said he told the television reporter that ``if that means I'm
a segregationist, then that's what I am.''
   But he said he does not favor any dismantling of desegregated
public schools now or a return to legal racial segregation. He also
said he never favored segregation of public facilities.
   ``Bus segregation and facilities, that was silly to start
with,'' he said.
   Appearing before the Alabama delegation, which is about half
black, Goodwin said his comment was not presented in context but,
``If I have offended any of my friends, I apologize.''

<HEAD>Kennedy Makes Stinging Attack On GOP Nominee-To-Be Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy lambasted George Bush in a
convention address, citing Reagan administration troubles like the
Iran-Contra affair and leading the packed house in the chant,
``Where was George?''
   ``The vice president says he wasn't there, or can't recall, or
never heard, as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms to
Iran. So when that monumental mistake was being made, I think it is
fair to ask, `Where was George'?'' Kennedy asked Tuesday night.
   ``George Bush is the man who is never there _ and he won't be
there after the clock strikes noon on Jan. 20, 1989,'' the senator
told the Democratic National Convention.
   Kennedy listed the Iran-Contra scandal, drug trafficking in
Central America and civil rights as political baggage from the
Reagan administration that Bush, the certain GOP presidential
nominee, is trying to avoid.
   ``At least Ronald Reagan accepts the blame as well as the credit
for the policies of the last eight years. He comes without excuses
and equivocation. He stands up, looks us in the eye,'' Kennedy
said. ``But not George Bush, who on question after question keeps
burying his head in his hands and hiding from the record of the
Reagan-Bush mistakes.''
   Kennedy dismissed the GOP as ``the party of Ed Meese and Robert
Bork. They are the party of Iran-gate, Contra-gate, Pentagon-gate.
And they are the party that tolerates apartheid abroad and retreats
from civil rights at home.''
   ``After eight years of complacency and indifference, of problems
untended and pains untreated, it is time to restore purpose and
principle to America.''
   Kennedy also rekindled memories of his brother John and the
``New Frontier'' campaign of 1960.
   ``Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, like John Kennedy and Lyndon
Johnson, believe that we cannot be content with things as they are,
that there is a newer frontier to be crossed and a greater society
to be built,'' the Massachusetts senator said.
   Kennedy, who appears to have completed the transformation from
presidential heir apparent to party elder without ever achieving
his own White House ambitions, praised Dukakis, whom he supported
early in the primary campaign.
   ``I have seen the presidency up close, and I have seldom seen
anyone as matched to the demands and possibilities of that office
as Mike Dukakis,'' Kennedy said.
   The senator, a leader of the party's liberal wing, also reached
out to Jesse Jackson, calling him ``one of the most talented
individuals in this nation, one whose life and words alike give new
meaning to our oldest ideals. He stands for freedom and compassion,
and his effort makes all of us prouder than ever to be Americans.''
   The senator was introduced by his nephew, John F. Kennedy Jr.,
whose appearance Kennedy said ``touched deep chords of memory and
hope in Democrats and Americans everywhere.''
   Kennedy also referred to his own presidential bid, telling the
convention crowd: ``For a long time, I have believed that what this
country needs is another president from Massachusetts. And now it's
going to happen.''
   Kennedy, 56, who is seeking his fifth full Senate term this year
for the seat once occupied by his brother John, said the Democratic
Party may have ``lost some elections, but we never lost our soul.
And we now know that the struggle has made us stronger, that this
country is ready to move again, and we are ready to lead.''

approved at the party's national convention.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   We the people of the Democratic Party of the United States of
America ... hereby pledge our party, our leaders, our elected
officials and our every individual effort to fulfilling the
following fundamental principles for all members of the American
family.
   We believe that all Americans have a fundamental right to
economic justice in a stronger, surer national economy that must
grow steadily without inflation, that can generate a rising
standard of living for all ... that, as a first-rate world power
moving into the 21st century, we can have a first-rate full
employment economy ...
   We believe that the time has come for America ... to reverse
seven years of ``voodoo economics,'' ``trickle down'' policies,
fiscal irresponsibility, and economic violence against poor and
working people ...
   We believe that government should set the standard in
recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by ... safe and
healthy work places, now jeopardized by seven callous years of
lowered and unenforced occupational safety standards for American
workers ...
   We believe that America needs more trade, fair trade, an
administration willing to use all the tools available to better
manage our trade in order to export more American goods and fewer
American jobs ...
   We believe that the education of our citizens, from Head Start
to institutions of higher learning, deserves our highest priority,
and that history will judge the next administration less by its
success in building new weapons of war than by its success in
improving young minds. ...
   We believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the
security of our nation from coast to coast ... that every arm and
agency of government at every federal, state and local level ...
should at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private
efforts under the direction of a national drug ``czar'' to halt
both the international supply and the domestic demand for illegal
drugs now ravaging our country ...
   We believe that the federal government should enforce a ban on
``cop killer'' bullets that have no purpose other than the killing
and maiming of law enforcement officershelp crime victims. ...
   We believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring
equal access to government services, employment, housing, business
enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race, sex,
national origin, religion, age, handicapping condition or sexual
orientation ...
   We believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted
... that homelessness _ a national shame _ should be ended in
America ...
   We believe that all Americans should enjoy access to affordable,
comprehensive health services ... that the HIV-AIDS epidemic is an
unprecedented public health emergency requiring increased support
for accelerated research on ... treatments and vaccines,
comprehensive education and prevention ...
   We believe that the last seven years have witnessed an
unprecedented assault on our national interest and national
security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain, the
dumping of toxic wastes into our water, and the destruction of our
parks and shores ...

   We believe that all Americans, producers and consumers alike,
benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large
corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of
family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product ...
   We believe that a balanced, coherent energy policy, based on
dependable supplies at reasonable prices, is necessary to protect
our national security, ensure a clean environment, and promote
stable economic growth and prosperity ...
   We believe that this country's democratic processes must be
revitalized ... by supporting statehood for the District of
Columbia ... by assuring and pledging the full and equal access of
women and minorities to elective office and party endorsement ...
   We believe in a clearheaded, tough-minded, decisive American
foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to
our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values
... that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it, and
that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally. ...
   We believe that our national strength has been sapped by a
defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new
weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility ...
   We believe in an America, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy,
that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons
for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions
in Lebanon and Honduras ... but by maintaining a stable nuclear
deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat ...
   We believe in following up the INF Treaty, a commendable first
step, with mutual, verifiable and enforceable agreements that will
make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that
diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower. ...
   We believe in an America that recognizes not only the realities
of East-West relations but the challenges and opportunities of the
developing world ... that we must enlist the trade surplus nations
to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives to fuel growth in
developing countries that, though economically depressed, are rich
in human and natural potential. ...
   We believe in an America that will promote human rights, human
dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth ...
   We believe the apartheid regime in South Africa to be a uniquely
repressive regime ... that the time has come ... to declare South
Africa a terrorist state, to impose comprehensive sanctions upon
its economy, ... and to determine a date certain by which United
States corporations must leave South Africa. ...
   In sum, we believe it is time for America to change and move
forward again in the interest of all its families ...
   We believe that governments at the national, state and local
level ... exist to help us solve our problems instead of adding to
them. ...
   Therefore, the Democratic Party ... hereby declares its
readiness to end the stalemate in Washington by challenging ... the
American people ... to do their patriotic best to meet their
community responsibilities ... and inviting them to join with us in
leading the land we love to a brighter and still greater future of
opportunity and justice for all.

<TEXT>
   One hundred and twenty-five abortion opponents
spent the night in the city jail because they refused to give their
real names after they were arrested for blocking a medical clinic.
   As demonstrators continued to bid for attention during the
Democratic National Convention, eight anti-war protesters and four
other convention-goers were arrested at various sites around the
city Tuesday.
   Convention security spokeswoman Myrna May said 134 were arrested
at a clinic that performs abortions, but only nine of the
protesters had given their names and posted bond as of early today.
   The rest told Municipal Court judges during arraignment hearings
that their names were ``Baby Jane Doe'' and ``Baby John Doe.''
Although their bonds were set, authorities would not allow them to
post bond under those names, Ms. May said.
   The 125 were taken to the city correction center to be held
``until they give their names,'' she said. Charges against them
included criminal trespassing, unlawful assembly and interfering
with a police officer.
   Elsewhere in the city, four members of the anti-war group No
Business As Usual were arrested for spraypainting slogans on a
building and four others from the group were arrested for blocking
a sidewalk during a march near the Carter Presidential Center.
   Four other people who were part of the convention crowd were
arrested for obstructing police when they tried to stop officers
who were questioning a skateboarder who had been riding in traffic,
Ms. May said.
   Two of those arrested were released on bond while the other two
were being held early today because they were refusing to be
fingerprinted, the convention security spokeswoman said.
   In other demonstrations on Tuesday:
   _Members of the Service Employees International Union picketed
the Marriott Marquis Hotel, one of the two convention headquarters,
in a dispute with the hotel owner, Atlanta architect-developer John
Portman. Organizers of a reception for Sens. Bob Graham of Florida
and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia canceled the party because of
the pickets.
   _The No Business As Usual group also staged an anti-war
demonstration at the city's officially designated protest site.
   _The Palestine Solidarity Committee rallied against U.S. funding
of Israel.
   _Representatives of the American Indian Movement denounced the
mistreatment of native Americans, and endorsed the independent
candidacy of Lenora B. Fulani of New York.
   _Advocates for some of the mothers of the 29 young blacks slain
in Atlanta between 1979-81, called for legal help for the mothers
who want police to solve the crimes involving their children. Wayne
B. Williams was convicted of two of the killings, and subsequently
blamed for 22 more _ although he was never charged in those cases.
   _A group called Public Advocates of the U.S. staged a ``trial''
of U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright complete with a ``judge'' in black
robes. The mock court found Wright guilty of ethics violations
before a small group of early morning onlookers.
   Red Cross volunteers were on duty at the protest area again
Tuesday, giving out cold water to overheated demonstrators,
onlookers and journalists, and assisting those suffering in the 90
degree-plus heat _ estimated to be much higher in the blacktop
parking lot.
   Bill Saye, captain of the Red Cross team, said some 45 people
were treated for heat-related problems, but none was serious.

   Thousands of people are fleeing the
island of Makian because a volcano dormant for 100 years has begun
erupting, but an official said today that there have been no
casualties.
   Provincial spokesman Yaapi Sahetapy said 3,000-foot Mount Kie
Bessy, 1,560 miles northeast of Jakarta, erupted Sunday, Monday and
Tuesday and spewed hot lava and dust as high as 7,000 feet.
   Residents were evacuating the 14-square-mile island today on
naval and other ships, Sahetapy said by telephone from the
provincial city of Ambon. He refused to say how many left.
   But the official Antara news agency said rescue workers using 17
vessels had evacuated about 5,000 of the island's 11,000 residents
by Tuesday.
   Sahetapy said the government ordered people to abandon the
island in 1976 after scientists predicted the volcano would
explode, but residents had returned.
   Last May, the eruption of 2,300-foot Mount Api on the island of
Gunung Api, 375 miles southeast of Makian, forced the evacuation of
thousands of local people.

<TEXT>
   Wildfires in northern Alaska have
burned an area the size of Rhode Island and then some, but most
people are oblivious to the blazes as the 49th state weathers its
worst fire season in 10 years.
   In far-reaching Alaska, 1,300 square miles of burned acreage is
like a postage stamp on a parcel. Here stories of firefighting
drama are rare; the terrain is flatter and less rocky, and the days
longer, than in other wildfire states.
   ``We don't have snakes, we don't have darkness,'' said Bill
Robertson, an Alaska Fire Service spokesman. ``We have crews that
go down to the Lower 48 and are amazed.''
   Fifty wildfires, one of them burning since April 16, continued
to burn today in Alaska's interior. The Alaska Fire Service manned
about one-third and monitored the others.
   A similar outbreak in the Lower 48 would have fire managers
scrambling to protect prime recreation lands and valuable timber.
In fact, firefighters were working today to contain a 14,000-acre
fire in Wyoming and had contained all but two of 15 fires that
burned more than 20,000 acres in Colorado.
   In Alaska, the fires have been blistering spindly black spruce
and other trees with little commercial value.
   Crews have worked to keep the fires away from a few scattered
cabins and to control those that sent bothersome smoke into
Fairbanks and other areas, in some cases obscuring the mountains
that draw thousands of summer tourists to the state. Officials also
have been concerned about smoke impairing the safety of pilots in
aviation-happy Alaska.
   But altogether, fire managers have taken a low-key approach to
suppression. In some areas, wildlife biologists are looking forward
to the enhanced habitat they say moose, bears and other animals
will gain because the burned areas yield new vegetation.
   ``Our research shows that most wildlife moves away from fire, so
they aren't usually threatened by it,'' said Fred Deines, fire
management officer for the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge.
``Ultimately, the refuge has better habitat to support the wildlife
when the fire burns out.''
   Only a few of the fires on the Yukon Flats refuge have been
manned.
   ``The majority of fires burn with no problem and no action is
required,'' Deines said. Authorities had no estimate on how long
the wildfires would continue to burn.
   In cases where fire managers did decide to act, most of the
firefighters dispatched were from Alaska, many of them native
villagers who were trained together and work in crews of 16.
   ``They aren't bringing too many people up from outside,'' said
Bill Rockwell, a fire information officer at the Alaska Fire Center
in Fairbanks. ``It hasn't gotten to that point yet.''
   The largest Alaska fire is a 225,000-acre blaze 60 miles north
of Fairbanks. That fire moved toward the trans-Alaska oil pipeline
but was stopped about 12 miles from it. The pipeline is covered
with heavy-gauge metal and was not threatened by the fire, Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co. said.
   Crews working on that and other fires get by on C-rations
supplemented by fresh food dropped to them every four days,
Robertson said. In other states, caterers often provide hot meals
and portable showers at fire camps. But the remoteness of the
Alaska sites makes that difficult.
   In Alaska, he said, it's possible to fight fires with fewer
people than are needed in other states. Fires burn slower and less
erratically, with temperatures influencing winds less than they do
elsewhere.
   However, it's been unusually dry in Alaska this year, fire
officials say. Lightning has caused many of the fires, with
hundreds of strikes per hour recorded by lightning-detection
equipment.
   Wind gusts unusual for interior Alaska and low humidity have
also helped to sustain this summer's fires, Robertson said.

   A 12-year-old girl was shot to death by
the 4-year-old boy she was babysitting as the two played together,
police said.
   Rhonda Whitlock was pronounced dead at Gulfport Memorial
Hospital on Tuesday of a single .38-caliber gunshot wound to the
back.
   Police identified the 4-year-old as Whitlock's brother, but a
neighbor, Arlena Smith, whose children with to school with the
victim, said the 4-year-old was the girl's nephew.
   ``The 12-year-old and the 4-year-old were playing in their
mother's bedroom when the 4-year-old found a gun in the bed and
accidentally shot the girl,'' police Lt. Donald Thurman said in a
statement.
   The owner of the gun was not immediately known, police said.

   A school official charged with lewd
behavior killed himself after making a videotape proclaiming his
innocence, not knowing that his 15-year-old accuser had recanted
her story two days earlier.
   ``I think that somebody somewhere along the line could have told
somebody that the story had been altered,'' the girl's mother told
the St. Petersburg Times in Tuesday's editions.
   Douglas Tarrant, 41, Pinellas County assistant school
superintendent for finance, died Friday in his car of carbon
monoxide poisoning. He was arrested July 11 on a charge of
committing a lewd and lascivious act.
   The 15-year-old told police that Tarrant asked her to get into
his car and was masturbating. But under questioning July 13, the
girl said Tarrant did nothing more than ask her to get into his
car, according to her mother.
   The mother called police and school officials to tell them her
daughter had recanted the sexual allegation, and the teen-ager was
asked to give a sworn statement to state prosecutors. The session
was scheduled for July 25.
   ``It's too late now. I did everything I knew to do,'' the mother
said after Tarrant's death.
   Tarrant's family said he was depressed over a serious health
problem and that his arrest was more than he could handle.
   He had worked for the school district since 1971 and was a
finance official for the past two years. He had been on medical
leave since June because of a serious heart condition that prompted
two heart attacks.
   Tarrant's brother Jeff said the girl's mother called him Monday
to tell him what had happened.
   ``She was very upset,'' he said. ``I'm just too shocked over the
whole thing.''
   Detective James Dressback said the mother called School
Superintendent Scott Rose on Thursday and he referred her to Steve
Crosby, personnel director, who was investigating the accusation.
   Crosby said he talked to the mother Friday morning, then called
Tarrant but didn't mention the mother's call because he was unsure
which story was correct.
   ``I told him that we wanted to straighten out the girl's story
and whether she was being truthful,'' Crosby said. ``I told him
there was some confusion. I told him we would request of her mother
that she take a polygraph exam.
   ``He said thanks for the consideration. Then he discussed
meeting with his attorney, and I gave him my home phone number and
asked him to give me a call after he met with his attorney.
   ``When somebody's talking to you about meeting with his attorney
on Monday,'' Crosby said, ``you just don't think that he might be
considering committing suicide.''

   A twin-engine plane crashed into a
backyard swimming pool, killing the 25-year-old pilot, a sheriff's
spokesman said.
   Neighbors said they saw the Beechcraft plane circling and heard
the engine sputtering before it plunged into the pool Tuesday night.
   The owner of the house and neighbors jumped in the pool and
tried to release the pilot from the plane. However, they could not
pry open the doors, a neighbor said.
   ``The plane was flying quite low, but then the engine sounded
rough. It went into a spin and didn't pull out,'' said the
neighbor, William Kunz.
   It is unclear whether the pilot died from impact or drowned,
sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Jeffrey Boyd said. The sheriff's
department would not release the name of the dead pilot, an Oregon
resident, until his relatives were notified.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was to investigate the
crash today.

<TEXT>
   The seven commanders of the
Nicaraguan rebels' southern military front resigned late Tuesday to
protest the election of Contra military chief Enrique Bermudez to
the movement's political leadership.
   The commanders lead 2,700 fighters based in Costa Rica. The
northern front, based in Honduras, has seven commanders and the
rest of the Contras' estimated 12,000 soldiers.
   Bermudez, 56, a colonel in the army of Anastasio Somoza before
the late right-wing Nicaraguan president was deposed, was elected
Monday to the seven-member directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   The directorate oversees the U.S.-backed insurgency against the
leftist government of the Sandinistas, who in 1979 defeated Somoza.
   A communique released in San Jose Tuesday night by the seven
field commanders condemned ``the placing in charge of the highest
military post of the insurgents an ex-colonel of the hated
Somocista National Guard.''
   It also charged Bermudez that deliberately withheld U.S. aid for
the rebels from the southern front to enhance his own power in the
movement.
   ``The Nicaraguan Resistance has not in the past, nor in the
present and nor will it in the future fulfill the yearnings and
hopes of the Nicaraguan exiles,'' the statement said.
   ``We want to emphasize that we don't question the right of all
Nicaraguans to participate in the liberation of the fatherland,''
it said.
   The communique said the decision to resign from the Resistance
was unanimously endorsed by the 2,700 fighters on the southern
front.
   It did not say whether they independently would continue their
war to topple Nicaragua's government.
   The statement identified the seven by their pseudonyms of Ganso,
Navegante, Pedro Rafa, Ramiro, Johnny, Ali and Omar.
   Commanders Ganso, Ali, Omar and Navegante participated in
high-level peace negotiations between the Resistance and the
Sandinistas held in Managua.
   Those talks, conducted under a temporary cease-fire agreement
reached March 23, broke down June 9.
   On Tuesday, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua announced a
unilateral extension of the cease-fire to Aug. 30.
   Bermudez was elected during a three-day meeting of the
Resistance, the Contras' umbrella organization, that ended Tuesday
in the Dominican Republic.
   The seven commanders said they decided not to attend the meeting
because they saw the election as a foregone conclusion.
   ``We always have suffered threats and pressures, most especially
on the part of ... Bermudez, who (with the support of) official
North American sectors notably reduced our U.S. assistance to
oblige us to submit'' to the colonel, the communique said.
   The statement said the southern front had received nothing from
a six-month, $17 million U.S. humanitarian aid package approved in
late March by Congress for the Contras.
   The last deliveries in U.S. military aid were made Feb. 29.
Congress has refused to renew military aid.
   Of a total $127 million in U.S. assistance, the southern front
commanders said they received just $5.5 million.
   Of the $17 million in humanitarian aid, the group claimed ``the
southern front has received nothing up to the moment, while the
troops in the northern front are supplied in constant form.
   ``Evidently patience has its limits,'' it continued. ``Given the
facts and (Bermudez's) apparent motives, we believe that we must
apply the old proverb that says, `It is better to walk alone than
to walk with bad company.'''

   Share prices rebounded sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Wednesday, and the dollar declined for the second
consecutive day against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which took the
biggest plunge of the year Tuesday, regained 404.95 points, or 1.49
percent, to close the day's trading at 27,553.98.
   The dollar, which opened at 133.05 yen and moved in a range of
132.90-133.35 yen, closed at 133.05 yen, down 0.80 yen. The dollar
was a 1.30 yen loser Tuesday.
   After opening the day at 27,330.72 points following Tuesday's
513.09-point loss, the most widely followed barometer on the stock
exchange fluctuated between 27,113.37 and 27,571.66 points.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated
at 1.3 billion shares.
   Brokers said some investors took advantage of Tuesday's losses
and bought large shares, such as steels and shipbuildings, that
declined Tuesday.
   ``Despite the moderate gain, the market as a whole is still
unstable and seems to be looking for a direction,'' said a broker
at a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   Exchange dealers attributed the dollar's decline to a sharp drop
in New York overnight, when the dollar slumped 1.36 yen to 133.155
yen.

<HEAD>Spanish Ambassador Lights Beacon On Armada Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chain of 461 beacons, part of a series of events
marking the 400th anniversary of the defeat of the Spanish Armada,
blazed across England early today to re-enact the warning that the
galleons were approaching.
   As then, the first fire was lit at Kynance, a headland near
Lizard village in the southwest tip of Cornwall, where local people
say the Armada was first sighted sailing up the English Channel in
1588.
   But it was a Spaniard, Ambasador Don Jose de la Bellacasa, who
lit the Kynance beacon Tuesday night.
   Using a long-handled flaming torch to fire the brazier atop an
oak pole, he parried reporters' questions about how he felt
celebrating one of his country's more spectacular reverses.
   ``It is not so clear it was a defeat,'' he said with a grin.
``You were lucky with the weather.''
   Historians have long argued over which played the greater part
in the defeat of the Armada _ Queen Elizabeth I's navy or gales
that decimated the ranks of the Spanish ships.
   The line of beacons stretched up the country as far as
Berwick-upon-Tweed about 450 miles northeast of Kynance.
   Bruno Peak, the organizer of the event called ``Fire Over
England,'' said: ``I invited the Spanish ambassador to light the
first beacon because I thought it was about time after 400 years
that we buried this old hatchet in a symbolic way.''
   The beacon lighting ceremony at Kynance and a dramatic fireworks
display there were shown live on nationwide television.
   Other celebrities lighting beacons elsewhere included Earl
Spencer, father of Princess Diana, who fired one at his stately
home of Althorp, 65 miles north of London.
   Britons staged processions, pageants and street-dancing, and
thousands donned Elizabethan dress and took up pikes and swords
after rehearsing for weeks.
   Legend has it that Elizabeth's favorite captain, Sir Francis
Drake, was so unflustered by the Armada's approach that he insisted
on finishing a game of bowls on a lawn at the southwestern port
city of Plymouth 80 miles from Kynance before sailing to battle.
   As crowds watched, a team of actors in Elizabeth costumes
enacted Drake's game at Plymouth on Tuesday.
   Tamsin Thomas, who was in charge of 10 of the 20 beacons in
Cornwall, said the Lizard villagers had been celebrating all day,
as they have done every anniversary for the past four centuries.
   Queen Elizabeth II will visit Plymouth on Thursday to join
Armada festivities.
   The Post Office issued 40 million stamps showing galleons and
cannon smoke, and a cereal company offered ``Armada Treasure
Replica Coins'' to British breakfasters.
   The replicas are copied from coins found in Armada ships wrecked
by gales as the great fleet struggled home after failing to link up
with a Spanish invasion army waiting in the Netherlands.
   The Armada's 125 ships carried 19,000 soldiers, 8,000 sailors,
2,000 galley slaves and 180 monks and friars, sent by King Philip
II of Roman Catholic Spain to overthrow England's Protestant Queen
Elizabeth I.
   James Mildren, a historian specializing in Armada lore, said of
the defeat of the Armada, ``The weather did help but the defeat was
a great victory for England because it raised the hearts of men in
dark hours.''

<HEAD>50-50 Chance Discovery Will Have To Be Taken Off Launch Pad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers are trying to fix a tiny
gas leak in the space shuttle, but there's a 50-50 chance Discovery
will have to be rolled back from the launch pad to a hangar for
repairs, says Kennedy Space Center's director.
   Taking Discovery off the pad would delay the first launch since
the Challenger disaster, now scheduled for early September, by up
to two months, Forrest S. McCartney told reporters Tuesday.
   ``We wish we had found it (the leak) earlier,'' McCartney said.
``If we had found it when it was accessible, there would have been
no problem. But it's in an inaccessible place, and we don't know
what we're going to do about it.
   ``We've got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to do.
Whatever course we take there will be no compromise in flight
safety.
   ``The odds are 50-50 on a rollback,'' McCartney said.
   He said no decision was likely until after Discovery's three
main engines have been test-fired on the pad in a critical test set
for July 28. The main engines are separate from the steering engine
system, where the leak is.
   The tiny nitrogen tetroxide gas leak was detected Friday in an
engine compartment, and was traced to a fitting on a line leading
to an oxidizer tank. Nitrogen tetroxide normally combines with fuel
to power the steering engines.
   Shuttle managers were combing through documents to determine
whether workers might have missed a similar leak as early as last
January.
   Launch Director Bob Sieck said paperwork showed that a pressure
check was made on the oxidizer tank manifold in an engine
compartment before Christmas, and that a second reading taken two
weeks later showed a pressure drop.
   The pressure drop occurred in the same area as the one detected
in January.
   ``We are reviewing all procedures and documentation and
equipment associated with that event,'' Sieck said.
   The earlier readings may have been within specifications, he
said. ``And I wouldn't preclude the fact that we have other data
that says the integrity of the joint was confirmed.
   ``Until a final review is in it is pure speculation that a
requirement was violated and not reported,'' Sieck said.
   The problem with fixing the leak on the pad is that the
22-foot-tall engine compartment probably would have to be removed,
a difficult task never done there before.
   Another option would be to take Discovery to a hangar and
replace the compartment as soon as possible with one being prepared
for a November flight by Atlantis. Such a move would eliminate the
need to wait for a leak repair, and could cut the launch delay to
about a month.
   Flying with the leak is a possibility, ``but we would have to
assure ourselves that it would be absolutely safe,'' Sieck said. A
possible danger is that during the return to Earth the nitrogen
tetroxide would mix with water in the atmosphere and form corrosive
nitric acid.
   Discovery is being grooomed to make the first shuttle mission
since Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven crew
members. Five veteran shuttle astronauts are to make the four-day
flight.

<HEAD>Change at `Think Tank' That Shaped Reagan Administration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell, who for nearly three decades has led the think tank that
launched many of the conservative ideas and leaders of the Reagan
presidency, says he will step down next year.
   Campbell said he hopes his move will end the academic, political
and legal dispute that has split the liberal Stanford University
campus and angered conservatives from California to Washington and
Wall Street.
   Campbell said he will remain at Hoover in an advisory role and
will hold the title of counselor, serve as member of all selection
and advisory committees, and stay in his office, formerly occupied
by founder and President Herbert Hoover.
   ``I used to be a young warrior, now I'm an aging warrior but not
yet an old warrior,'' he said in a two-hour interview Monday with
The Associated Press before presenting his proposal to Hoover's
Board of Overseers.
   Campbell, a close friend of President Reagan and a member of his
original ``kitchen cabinet,'' said the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace will remain on the Stanford campus and keep
its financial and academic independence as a policy research center.
   Hoover has been a frequent target of criticism by Stanford
faculty and students who disapprove of its conservative political
activities and ties to the Reagan administration.
   Reagan, an honorary fellow at Hoover, charted his course as
California governor and in the White House with the help of
advisers from Hoover, including economists Martin Anderson and
Milton Friedman.
   Departing Attorney General Edwin Meese III recently accepted
Campbell's invitation to join Hoover as a visiting fellow while he
writes a book on his years with Reagan.
   Campbell, who has led Hoover since 1960, proposes to step aside
as director after he turns 65 next April, but remain in the job
until his successor takes over at the end of next summer.
   Anderson called Campbell ``the premier intellectual entrepreneur
of the century'' but said his move ``makes a lot of sense.''
Anderson will sit on a 10-person search committee for Campbell's
successor.
   James Gaither, Stanford trustee president, said he thought
Campbell made the right decision and hoped it would bring the
different sides together on campus.
   ``There have been problems in the past, obviously, but we're
committed to working together to improve relations between Stanford
and Hoover,'' Gaither said. ``I'm very happy that Dr. Campbell has
chosen to help resolve those problems.''
   Campbell's surprise announcement comes two months after he vowed
to sue Stanford if it tried to oust him at 65, five years before he
planned to leave, on the grounds it was the customary retirement
age at the university.
   Campbell, who noted several exceptions to the rule, called
Stanford's action ``an attempted takeover'' motivated by politics
and greed.
   Stanford president Donald Kennedy and former trustees' president
Warren Christopher were Carter administration officials, and the
majority of faculty are Democrats.
   Campbell, an unabashed conservative Republican, said the problem
between Hoover and Stanford is ``not as simple''' as politics alone.
   ``All these people (at Stanford) want is the money and
buildings,'' said Campbell, whose large wood-paneled office is on
the 11th floor of the landmark Hoover Tower in the center of campus.
   Gaither, Anderson and others said they believed Campbell decided
to step down as a constructive move to avoid further strains that
might hurt the images of Hoover and Stanford.
   Campbell, a Harvard economist who once had former Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker as a student, was selected by
former President Hoover as his successor at the institution.
   Campbell's fund-raising helped boost a $2 million endowment to
its current level of more than $110 million.
   The Hoover Institution is among the nation's premier think
tanks, a place where more than 100 scholars, policy makers and
leaders write books and articles on foreign affairs, national
security and economics.
   They meet regularly to exchange ideas, often while munching
cookies at the ritual midday coffee hour.

<HEAD>Seven Contra Commanders Resign To Protest Bermudez Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUAN MALTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The seven commanders of the
Nicaraguan rebels' southern military front have quit in protest of
the election to the movement's political leadership of Contra
military chief Enrique Bermudez.
   The commanders, who resigned late Tuesday, lead 2,700 rebel
fighters. The rest of the Contras' estimated 12,000 guerrillas are
based in Honduras.
   Bermudez, 56, a colonel in the army of Anastasio Somoza before
the late right-wing Nicaraguan president was deposed, was elected
Monday to the seven-member directorate of the Nicaraguan Resistance.
   The directorate oversees the U.S.-backed insurgency against the
leftist government of the Sandinistas, who led the revolution that
defeated Somoza in 1979. Many Contras backed the revolution but
later became disaffected with the Sandinistas.
   A communique released in San Jose Tuesday night by the seven
field commanders condemned ``the placing in charge of the highest
military post of the insurgents an ex-colonel of the hated
Somocista National Guard.''
   Dissidents have accused him of being inefficient, corrupt and
too close to Somoza supporters.
   The communique charged that Bermudez deliberately withheld U.S.
aid for southern front rebels to enhance his own power in the
movement.
   ``The Nicaraguan Resistance has not in the past, nor in the
present and nor will it in the future fulfill the yearnings and
hopes of the Nicaraguan exiles,'' the statement said.
   ``We want to emphasize that we don't question the right of all
Nicaraguans to participate in the liberation of the fatherland,''
it said.
   The resign commanders said their decision to leave the
Resistance was unanimously endorsed by the 2,700 fighters they
command, whom they claim represent 40 percent of the Contra forces.
   The communique did not say whether they would independently
continue effprts to topple Nicaragua's government.
   The statement identified the seven by their pseudonyms of Ganso,
Navegante, Pedro Rafa, Ramiro, Johnny, Ali and Omar. Commanders
Ganso, Ali, Omar and Navegante participated in high-level peace
negotiations between the Resistance and the Sandinistas held in
Managua.
   Those talks, conducted under a temporary cease-fire agreement
reached March 23, broke down June 9.
   On Tuesday, President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua announced a
unilateral extension of the cease-fire to Aug. 30.
   Bermudez was elected during a three-day meeting of the
Resistance, the Contras' umbrella organization, that ended Tuesday
in the Dominican Republic capital of Santo Domingo.
   The seven commanders said they decided not to attend the meeting
because they saw the election as a foregone conclusion.
   ``We always have suffered threats and pressures, most especially
on the part of ... Bermudez, who (with the support of) official
North American sectors notably reduced our U.S. assistance to
oblige us to submit'' to the colonel, the communique said.
   The statement said the southern front has received nothing from
a $17 million U.S. humanitarian aid package that Congress approved
in late March while ``troops in the northern front are supplied in
constant form.''
   The last deliveries in U.S. military aid were made Feb. 29.
Congress has refused to renew military aid.
   Of a total $127 million in U.S. assistance, the southern front
commanders said they received just $5.5 million.
   Bermudez's position in the Resistance was enhanced during the
Santo Domingo meeting by the re-election of his closest ally on the
directorate, Aristedes Sanchez, and of Alfredo Cesar, who spoke
strongly in favor of his candidacy.
   Newly elected director Wilfredo Montalvan also was seen as a
Bermudez supporter, but the allegiances of Roberto Ferrey and
Wycliffe Diego were less clear.
   Ferrey replaces his sister, Azucena, who decided not to seek
re-election, and Diego fills a vacant seat representing Nicaragua's
Atlantic Coast Indians and Creoles. Bermudez won a second vacant
seat.
   Adolfo Calero, 56, who as the directorate's senior member had
been regarded as its political head, also was re-elected. He is a
rival of Bermudez.
   Calero dismissed suggestions that the colonel's election would
lessen chances that Congress will resume military aid to the
Contras.
   Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, who was ousted from the directorate,
said he thought Bermudez was determined to take absolute control of
the Resistance.
   ``I don't think he has total control, but that his clearly his
intention,'' said Chamorro, a 36-year-old former Nicaraguan
journalist.
   In April, Calero and Chamorro sided with dissidents who tried
but failed to strip Bermudez of his military command after he fired
six commanders in Honduras for mutiny.

   Brooks is suing his former fiance for breach of promise,
contending he was ``hoodwinked, tricked and manipulated in the name
of love.''
   In his lawsuit filed in Fayette Circuit Court, Brooks, 32,
claims Angela Denise Johnson broke their engagement after he was
arrested for an alleged parole violation, even though she was
``well aware of (his) criminal record'' when she agreed to be his
wife.
   Brooks, who filed the lawsuit last week from the Fayette County
Detention Center, also accused Ms. Johnson of misappropriating
$3,000 of his money and subjecting him to mental cruelty and
anguish.
   In the suit, handwritten on yellow legal paper, Brooks seeks
$100,000 in punitive damages from Ms. Johnson.
   Ms. Johnson, whose telephone number is not listed, could not be

   A 13-year-old boy who was accused of
stealing a 45-cent package of baseball cards shot and killed
himself an hour later, authorities said.
   The victim, who died in an Aurora hospital early Tuesday, was
not identified by police.
   The youngster was accused of shoplifting the baseball cards from
a convenience store near his Aurora home, said police Division
Chief Mike Stiers.
   A police officer summoned by the store's clerk issued the boy a
citation that ordered him to appear with a parent in court next
month. The officer then contacted the boy's mother.
   ``The next call we got was from the sister indicating that the
boy had shot himself,'' Stiers said.
   The boy apparently returned home, obtained a .22-caliber
revolver from a gun cabinet in a family room and shot himself in an
upstairs bedroom.
   ``It scares you, that's what it does, to think that a
13-year-old child resorts to that,'' Stiers said. ``Some way we
have to communicate to children that suicide's not a solution to
any kind of problem.''

<HEAD>Leftist Group Claims Attack On U.S. Soldiers</HEAD>

   A leftist guerrilla group claimed
responsibility for an attack that wounded six U.S. soldiers and it
said Honduras will not be at peace until the U.S. military leaves.
   Assailants hurled a grenade and opened fire on the soldiers as
they were leaving a discotheque in a rented van early Sunday in San
Pedro Sula, 125 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa. Three other
soldiers in the van were not hurt.
   One of the six was treated and released Sunday. The other five
were in good condition Tuesday at the hospital at Palmerola Air
Base, headquarters for U.S. operations, U.S. Embassy spokesman
Charles Barclay said.
   The Cinchonero People's Liberation Movement said in a statement
distributed to local newspapers Tuesday that its ``Lempira
Command'' attacked the soldiers in ``memory of the first Honduran
war chief who led an armed resistance against foreign invaders.''
   Lempira was a Mayan Indian chief who fought against Spanish
conquerors.
   ``As long as there is a Yankee military and Nicaraguan
counterrevolutionary presence here there will never be peace,'' the
guerrilla group's communique said.
   The United States maintains about 1,500 troops at Palmerola and
has conducted military exercises with Honduras since 1982.
   Honduras also has permitted Contra rebels to maintain base camps
in Honduras in their seven-year war to oust Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   Col. Lazaro Avila Soleno, commander of the Honduran army's 105th
infantry brigade in San Pedro Sula, said officials had no leads in
the case.
   ``We consider the attack an isolated action whose investigation
will follow the course of the law to provide tranquility to the
citizens,'' he said.
   Newspapers said Tuesday that secret police had arrested six
people in the case. Military intelligence sources said FBI agents
were in San Pedro Sula to work on the case.
   The Cinchonero guerrillas emerged in 1979 as the first armed
group of the Honduran Communist Party, which has operated
underground since it was founded in 1950.
   Authorities blame the group for more than 10 terrorist attacks
on U.S. companies in Honduras, hijacking three commercial airliners
between 1979 and 1983 and the kidnappings of businessmen.

<HEAD>Eastern May Lay Off At Least 4,000 Employees, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines may lay off at least 4,000 people
and implement service reductions affecting 15 to 20 cities in what
could be the largest labor cutback by the ailing carrier, The Miami
Herald reported today.
   The layoffs would affect nonunion airport and reservations
employees and Eastern's service primarily in the West, especially
in the company's Kansas City hub, the newspaper said, citing
sources who asked not to be identified.
   Boston also will be affected, the sources said.
   The financially strapped carrier, which last November laid off
3,500 employees, mostly in Miami and Atlanta, and closed a
reservations center in Chicago, is also considering closing one or
more of its remaining nine reservations centers, the Herald said.
   The embattled Miami-based carrier has been contemplating deep
cutbacks in service and labor for the fall. The reported plan, if
carried out, would cut Eastern's work force of 32,000 by 12.5
percent.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell declined to comment.
   ``The (flight) schedules themselves are still being worked on,''
he said. ``The next schedule change would be for Aug. 31.''
   The company's fall schedule is expected to be announced Friday.
   Managers who supervise the affected areas have been summoned to
Miami for briefings Friday, when negotiators for Eastern and the
pilots union are also scheduled to meet. Eastern has asked its
3,500 pilots for $69 million in savings through productivity
increases and reductions in benefits.
   Eastern, which has shrunk since its acquisition by Houston-based
Texas Air Corp. in 1986, has cut its work force over the past two
years from 42,000. The carrier now serves 130 U.S. and foreign
cities, down from 145 two years ago.
   Texas Air and Eastern Chairman Frank Lorenzo has said that
Eastern, which is losing $1 million a day, will sell assets and
shrink to cover losses. Management has blamed much of the losses on
high labor costs.
   Eastern, embroiled in bitter contract talks with its pilots and
machinists unions, is seeking $161 million in annual wage and work
rule concessions from more than 10,000 unionized mechanics and
other ground workers. Federally mediated talks have been under way
since January, and continued this week.
   Airport officials in Kansas City, where cutbacks have been
rumored for months, said they had not been told of the latest
changes.
   ``We've had frequent discussions with Eastern people,'' said Del
Karmeier, director of aviation at Kansas City International
Airport. ``We have been told as late as yesterday that no
information is available.''
   Eastern operates 53 daily flights there, and its commuter
partner, Air Midwest of Wichita, funnels 90 flights a day into
Kansas City and the Eastern system.

   Here, at a glance, are developments at the
Democratic National Convention:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DUKAKIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' marathon bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination culminates at the party
convention tonight. Dukakis was to visit the Omni convention hall
this morning to tour the massive rostrum from which he will deliver
his acceptance speech Thursday. Aides said the speech contained an
upbeat message focusing on economic opportunity and praise for
Jesse Jackson and Dukakis' chosen running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen. Earlier Tuesday, Dukakis visited the gravesite of Martin
Luther King Jr. and praised the slain civil rights leader as
someone who ``cared very deeply about some basic human values.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JACKSON</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Jesse Jackson asks for his party's nomination tonight, even
though Dukakis has a lock on the delegates. In his 50-minute
campaign valedictory Tuesday night, Jackson saluted Dukakis for a
``well-managed and dignified campaign'' and appealed to followers
of both campaigns to find a common ground. ``The only time we win
is when we come together,'' he said. Some angry delegates waved
their credentials and shouted at police because after party leaders
had the building's entrances sealed off to the crowds at the fire
marshal's suggestion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PLATFORM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   The Democrats adopted a brief, 4,500-word platform that
carefully avoids giving fodder to their GOP opponents in the
November election. Michael Barnes, the former Maryland congressman
who worked on the platform for Dukakis, said nothing in the
document ``would in any way commit the next Congress or commit the
next president, even theoretically'' to any specific spending
program. As Jackson demanded, it condemned South Africa as a
terrorist state but delegates rejected Jackson's calls for higher
taxes on the wealthy and a pledge not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons. Jackson withdrew a demand for a five-year freeze
on Pentagon spending.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BUSH WHACKING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Convention speakers engaged in a series of attacks on Vice
President George Bush, the certain Republican nominee. Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy got the crowded hall to repeatedly chant with him,
``Where was George?'' Kennedy derided Bush as the man who ``keeps
burying his head in his hands and hiding from the record of the
Reagan-Bush mistakes.'' Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim
Hightower told the delegates that Bush was a ``toothache of a man''
who doesn't care about the problems of anyone but the rich.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PROTESTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Police arrested 134 hymn-singing abortion opponents blocking a
medical clinic, and 125 of them spent the night in the city jail
after refusing to give their real names. Four members of an
anti-war group were arrested for spraypainting slogans on a
building and four others from the group were arrested for blocking
a sidewalk during a march. Four other people who were part of the
convention crowd were arrested for obstructing police when they
tried to stop officers who were questioning a skateboarder who had
been riding in traffic, Convention security spokeswoman Myrna May
said.

<HEAD>Four Years After Ferraro, Women Focus on Insider's Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Geraldine Ferraro strode to the podium at
the Democratic National Convention four years ago, there was
rejoicing that a woman had finally demolished a historic barrier
and joined the ticket of a major U.S. political party.
   But that was then and this was now.
   Women are insiders _ not outsiders _ at the 1988 convention.
   They're no longer toasting their triumphs and spoiling for new
battles. They're down in the political trenches alongside men,
taking quiet satisfaction at the thought that the Democrats are
about to nominate a presidential candidate _ Michael Dukakis _ who
supports them on most issues.
   ``Gerry was the pioneer,'' said Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
``I listened to her speech again at 2 o'clock this morning and it
still brought tears to my eyes.''
   Women activists agree there's little taste for making history in
Atlanta.
   ``We don't see the focus, because we don't have the ticket. Even
if we did have a woman on the ticket, there wouldn't be the same
emotion.
   ``We're now into the nuts and bolts of things,'' said Ms. Oakar,
who is co-chairman of the Atlanta convention's platform committee.
``What women did was the smart thing.''
   Although there is disagreement over Ms. Ferraro's impact on the
outcome of the 1984 election, there is no doubt that she galvanized
women and spurred others to run for public office.
   Women are seen speaking from the podium, cheering from the
convention floor as delegates and running convention committees.
Most polls indicate that women are contributing heavily to Dukakis'
strong showing against Republican candidate George Bush.
   ``People keep acting like we're banished,'' says Rep. Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo. ``We're not banished. We're under the tent.''
   ``These guys are hard to break through,'' says New York delegate
Bella Abzug, a former congresswoman. ``It doesn't come overnight.''
   ``The gender gap has proven once and for all they need to appeal
to women,'' said Celinda Lake, a Washington-based pollster who
researches women's issues. ``They may not know how to do it, but
they know they're supposed to.''
   Democratic women seem determined to eliminate disputes and
present a united front. ``There's no reason to be on the streets at
this convention,'' Ms. Lake said.
   ``There's a lot to be said for jumping up and down and those of
us on the inside love to do it,'' said Iowa Democratic Chairwoman
Bonnie Campbell. ``Is it as much fun? It will be the night of Nov.
8.''
   She added: ``I think it's directly attributable to the sense of
pragmatism that seems to be permeating everything this year. I
think now there's a sense of being on good behavior. It is part of
the evolution of the movement.''
   Veteran feminist Gloria Steinem says there's no reason for women
to fight when Dukakis is on their side.
   ``He's great on all our issues,'' she said. ``We don't need to
kick up our heels.''
   ``Movements go through stages,'' she added.
   ``The movement is still at the stage of developing a
consensus,'' said Monica McFadden, head of governmental relations
for the National Federation of Business and Professional Women.
   Gesturing toward a meeting of women activists, she said: ``You
ask this group what the most important item on the agenda is and
you'll get 74 different answers.''

<TEXT>
   They are here with brave faces and dashed hopes,
listening to speeches they hoped to make, watching the coronation
they fought for. They are the also-rans of 1988, and they had other
plans for this week.
   ``Obviously there are mixed feelings,'' said Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, who gave up his Democratic primary campaign April 7 after
washing out in Wisconsin. ``You'd like to be where Mike is.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis is a day away from the victory speech that
will cap his long fight for the party's nomination. A year ago he
was with the rest of them: scrabbling for serious attention,
ridiculed for lacking stature.
   He gained both by outlasting his opponents, and all but one were
on hand to see him claim the spoils. They did so ungrudgingly, most
with expressions of support but with a tinge of wistfulness at what
might have been.
   ``I enjoyed it. I had a great time,'' Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee said Tuesday night, looking back on his 10-month
campaign. He called it quits on April 21, whipped in New York and
$2.1 million in debt.
   The debt's been retired and the lesson's been learned, Gore
said. If he were to do it again, and he may, ``I would start
earlier.''
   But there are pitfalls other than too little time, as the
vanquished veterans of the Democratic campaign will attest. Few
started earlier than Gary Hart, who finished second in 1984 and was
favored to win this time.
   A dalliance with a model spelled the Hart campaign's demise in
May 1987, though he tried a comeback that sputtered through Super
Tuesday before he quit, for keeps, on March 11. Hart is in Atlanta
as a newspaper columnist and a commentator for Italian television.
   No, he said this week, he's not resentful about the race. ``I'm
grateful to be alive and to be here.'' His viewpoint, while it may
reach fewer people now, is unchanged from the iconoclastic message
of his campaign. ``Everybody at the convention,'' he said, ``keeps
their sights too low.''
   A second former candidate has switched to the other side of the
notebook _ former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt, whose quick wit won
him favorable media reviews but few votes. He hung up his campaign
running shoes Feb. 18 and came to Atlanta as a newspaper and
television commentator.
   Though he was speaking of former President Carter, Babbitt's
thoughts in his column Tuesday could have been a reflection on his
own fortunes: ``I've always thought that the true test of character
is what politicians do when the lights go out and, humbled by
defeat, they make the long trip back home.''
   But there was a hint of frustration at his failed effort, too.
``Nothing happens at a convention anymore,'' he told an
interviewer. ``They don't even put our names in nomination anymore.
There is nothing but spectators.''
   Babbitt is more than a spectator, though. He is a delegate
pledged to Dukakis. Similarly, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
who gave up his campaign March 28, is here as a Dukakis delegate.
   Gephardt told his fellow delegates Tuesday he had been given a
fair shot at the presidency. He ran, he said, because ``I could not
bear the thought of sitting on the west side of the Capitol next
January, watching them swear in George Bush, and having to turn to
one of my colleagues and say, `Why didn't we do something about
this?'''
   Of the two other men who sought and lost the 1988 Democratic
nomination, one remained the most in the public eye, the other the
least.
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware quit Sept. 23 amid charges he
borrowed speeches without attribution and had been accused of
plagiarism as a college student. He was at home this week,
convalescing from surgery for an aneurysm near his brain.
   The other was Jesse Jackson, who lasted the course with Dukakis
and addressed the convention Tuesday night. Though he knew he could
not win, Jackson at least had the solace of speaking the words all
his former rivals had set as their goal.
   ``Hope is eternal,'' he said. ``Tomorrow night my name will go
into nomination for the presidency of the United States.''

<HEAD>Witnesses: Three Of Four Shooting Victims Died While Deputies
Watched</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ At least three of the four people
killed by a man with a rifle were gunned down at point-blank range
while sheriff's deputies crouched behind their cruisers some 40
yards away, witnesses said.
   ``They didn't fire at all,'' said Adrian Hodges, who watched
from a bank parking lot. ``There was two of them. I seen them
leaning against their cars with their hands across the cars. I
assume they had their guns out.''
   Forsyth County Sheriff's department officials on Tuesday
declined to discuss any details relating to the shooting, saying
that an investigation is not complete.
   After deputies arrived at the scene late Sunday night, witnesses
said they saw the gunman shoot at least three people. Witnesses
were unsure if the fourth victim was shot after deputies had
arrived.
   Five other motorists were wounded by the gunman, identified by
police as Michael Charles Hayes, 24. Hayes' family had tried to
have him committed to a mental hospital the day before the shooting.
   Hayes was in satisfactory condition today at North Carolina
Baptist Hospital, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds
suffered in a shootout with deputies. Authorities have charged him
with two counts of first-degree murder.
   Deputies blocked only northbound traffic on one street with
their parked cars, leaving open a road from the east and west and
another road southbound from Winston-Salem, Hodges and other
witnesses said. Cars continued to drive into the gunman's range
during the 12-minute rampage, they said.
   Sheriff's department officials refused to say how many deputies
were at the scene.
   Ronald Hull, one of the four killed, was eastbound with his
wife, Darlene, and son. His brother, David Hull, said the roadblock
prompted his brother to turn directly into the path of the gunman.
   ``People were shot before my brother even entered the area,''
Hull said. ``I just can't comprehend why they (the deputies) did
what they did. They put the traffic right into the middle of it.''
   Recounting his brother's final moments, he said, ``The man
jumped out in front of him and told him to stop, hollering and
waving a gun. He told him to cut his truck off and (turn) his
inside light on.
   ``Ron raised his hands off the steering wheel and said,
`Anything you say, just don't hurt my family.' And the boy busted
the window out and put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger.''
   The gunman also wounded Ronald Hull's wife.
   Hull insisted the sheriff's department should have blocked all
routes leading past Hayes' moped shop, even though it was near the
border of neighboring Davidson County.
   ``I think the sheriff's department is to blame,'' he said. ``If
they had crossed that county line and blocked (both roads), then my
brother wouldn't have been involved in it. I think they put the
roadblock in the wrong place.''

<TEXT>
   A revised estimate that the AIDS virus has
infected half as many New Yorkers as thought could change national
figures, says the city's top health official, but a federal
spokesman contends it's ``too early to tell.''
   City Health Commissioner Dr. Stephen Joseph said he informed the
federal Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday about the revision
from 400,000 infected New York residents to 200,000.
   ``Since New York represents 23 percent of the AIDS cases
nationally, if they accept our methodology it will make some
changes in their estimates,'' Joseph told a news conference.
   The CDC estimates 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are
infected with the virus that causes acquired immune defiency
syndrome.
   ``It's really too early to tell if it will affect our figures,''
said CDC spokesman Charles Fallis in Atlanta. ``At this point,
we're sticking with what we originally said.''
   The new estimate does not mean there will be a change in
projections of how many AIDS cases there will be in the early
1990s, because those forecasts are based on cases of people who
actually have AIDS, Joseph said.
   New York has been using the old estimate of 400,000 for nearly
three years.
   It was based on decades-old data from research by Alfred Charles
Kinsey which estimated that one out of 10 men engaged in homosexual
behavior, and on surveys indicating there was a 50 percent AIDS
virus infection rate among homosexual men.
   The CDC bases its estimates on the same data.
   The city estimates that by 1991 there will be 43,000 AIDS
patients needing serious medical treatment in New York. That figure
was ``based on trends of past and current AIDS cases which we are
quite confident are accurate,'' Joseph said.
   The same cannot be said of the number of people infected with
the AIDS virus. That figure always has been ``just an estimate ...
and one that at times varies widely,'' Joseph said.
   The new figure is based on recent studies in San Francisco on
the number of infected homosexuals there.
   The New York figure is based on the hypothesis that the ratio of
the number of homosexual men with AIDS to the number of infected
gay men is about the same in the two cities, Joseph said.
   There are 7,499 homosexual men in New York with AIDS and 4,071
in San Francisco. Using that ratio and data that estimates there
are 27,517 infected homosexual and bisexual men in San Francisco,
officials theorize there are an estimated 50,000 infected gay men
in New York, rather than the previously estimated 200,000 to
250,000.
   The number is significant because most health officials now
agree that nearly all of those carrying the virus will get AIDS.
   Joseph said the San Francisco data were considered more valid
than old data because ``they are based on a much smaller, tighter,
more homogeneous situation'' and because San Francisco is further
ahead than anyone else in terms of blood test data.
   The number of intravenous drug users believed to be carrying the
virus is unchanged, Joseph said. About 100,000 of the approximately
200,000 intravenous drug users are estimated to be infected.
   
   Joseph also said the revision will not affect funding for AIDS
prevention or services.
   The new estimate came out just two months after the city
released a five-year master plan based on the old figure, under
which New York would spend $334 million on prevention, education
and services.
   ``It would really be a mistake for anybody or any group to take
these figures and say because of that we can do less or because of
that we can do differently,'' Joseph said. ``Those expenditures
will need to stay where they are.''

   The use of balloons to open up damaged aortic
heart valves should be reserved for people who are too old and sick
to undergo surgery to repair the condition, according to a new
study.
   The balloon technique is used as an alternative to surgery in
people whose heart valves don't work properly.
   However, young, otherwise healthy patients with aortic valve
narrowing should have surgery to replace the valve, Dr. Peter C.
Block of Massachusetts General Hospital wrote in an editorial
accompanying a report on the study.
   The report is in the latest New England Journal of Medicine,
which comes out Thursday.
   The study, directed by Dr. Robert D. Safian of Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston, examined the balloon technique's value in
people with malfunctioning aortic valves, which allow blood to flow
into the aorta, the body's main artery.
   In about half of the 170 patients treated, the valves narrowed
up again within a year of the procedure. Six of the patients, whose
average age was 77, died in the hospital, and about three-fourths
survived at least a year.
   Block wrote that the balloon procedure may be useful for frail
and sick elderly people who have other heart problems.
   But he said elderly patients who have no other medical problems
and are strong and willing to undergo surgery should be advised to
choose surgery.
   Results have been more promising when the balloon procedure is
used to relieve narrowing of the mitral valve, which controls the
flow of blood into the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping
chamber.
   In another study reported in the journal, doctors concluded that
open-heart surgery can be effective for people in their 80s. They
reviewed the cases of 50 such people who underwent coronary bypass
or valve replacement operations.
   They calculated that 59 percent would still be alive after three
years and 54 percent after five years.
   The report, written by Dr. L. Henry Edmunds Jr. and others at
the University of Pennsylvania, concludes that surgery is ``a
reasonable therapeutic option'' in elderly people who cannot be
treated in other ways, even though death and complication rates are
high.

<HEAD>Zia Calls Elections For Nov. 16</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mohammad Zia ul Haq today
set Nov. 16 for elections to the National Assembly and promised
free and independent balloting for a clean government.
   Zia, the army chief of staff, on May 29 fired his civilian prime
minister, Mohammad Khan Junejo, the 33-member Cabinet and the
237-member assembly, the lower but more powerful house of
Parliament.
   The president, speaking before the Senate, also called elections
for Nov. 16 for legislatures in the provinces of Punjab, Sind,
Baluchistan and Northwest Frontier.
   The announcement followed seven weeks of intense pressure by all
political parties to hold elections and let the nation return to a
democratically elected system.
   When he fired the government, Zia accused the officials of
corruption, incompetence and failure to move quickly on making
Islam the state religion and to prevent a breakdown in law and
order.
   Junejo and other politicians denied the charges. Junejo accused
Zia of ``arbitrarily dissolving the assembly and disrupting a
democratic system which was operating smoothly.''
   Some critics said the Constitution requires elections within 90
days of the dissolution of Parliament.
   But Zia said an August election was impossible because of a
religious holiday among Shiite Moslems, the monsoon season, the
absence of 80,000 to 90,000 pilgrims in Mecca and the need to
redraw districts to reflect population shifts.
   ``Elections will be free, fair and independent,'' he said. ``The
objective of the election is to establish and promote clean
politics, clean democracy and clean democratic institutions.''
   He offered an apology of sorts for his criticism of former
elected officials: ``If anyone has felt hurt by this I express my
regrets. My intention was not to hurt anyone, or assassinate
anyone's character.''
   Some opposition leaders have accused Zia supporters and former
Cabinet members with corruption since Zia seized power in a 1977
military coup.
   Zia overthrew Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged in 1979. His
daughter, Benazir Bhutto, heads Pakistan's strongest opposition,
the Pakistan People`s Party.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told his
people today that many of Iran's problems have been caused by its
resistance to United States' policy in the region, Tehran Radio
said.
   It was the first statement from Iran's 87-year-old spiritual
leader since Iran announced two days ago that it would accept the
year-old U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament and
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, said it was Khomeini who
decided to accept the resolution.
   Khomeini had previously rejected all attempts to end the war,
saying Iran would continue fighting until Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein was overthrown.

   The blistering heat wave that has broiled the
Yangtze River area of China this month has killed 71 people in
Shanghai, an official Chinese report said.
   Hospitals in the Shanghai area also reported treating 353
patients, mostly the infirm and elderly, for heat stroke as of
Sunday, a China News Service article appearing in Hong Kong on
Wednesday said.
   The mercury soared to 100 degrees in Shanghai on Sunday, the
highest yet this year, but by Tuesday had cooled under the
influence of a typhoon that approached the southern China coast.
   The report warned, however, that after two or three days of
cooler weather the heat wave could return.
   The Shanghai death toll, which the news service attributed to
reports coming from two funeral homes, brings to more than 400 the
number of people who have died in the searing heat along the
Yangtze River.
   Official media has reported 290 elderly people died in the
southern city of Nanchang and 83 people died from the heat in
Nanjing, the capital of coastal Jiangsu province.

<HEAD>Firefighters Battle Blazes in Wyoming; Alaska Fires Allowed to
Burn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire crews used picks and shovels today as they tried to stop a
14,000-acre Wyoming wildfire from spreading into Yellowstone
National Park, where other fires charred nearly 13,000 acres of
backcountry.
   In Alaska, 50 fires _ one of them burning since April 16 _
covered about 450,000 acres in remote inland areas, but officials
left most of them to burn because there was no threat to lives or
property.
   Fires also burned in parts of California, Colorado, Utah and
Oregon.
   The blaze in Wyoming's Bridger-Teton National Forest wilderness
area edged to within two miles of Yellowstone.
   Crews brought industrial sprinklers and miles of plastic hose to
moisten Yellowstone Meadows, a popular recreational area on the
forest's border with the national park.
   Firefighters had little more than picks, shovels and the water
tanks they carry on their backs to fight the flames because of
wilderness area restrictions. They used natural firebreaks such as
meadows, streams and rock outcroppings to stop the fire.
   The fire ``continues to show the vulnerability and explosiveness
of the fuels,'' U.S. Forest Service spokesman Fred Kingwill said.
``It is very, very dry. It's been dry for a number of years. ...
It's a fire condition that probably very few people have seen
before.''
   The rugged territory, at an elevation of about 8,500 feet and in
prime grizzly bear habitat, has forced officials to use helicopters
to shuttle firefighters around.
   In Yellowstone, officials monitored several fires covering
12,850 acres, imposed campfire restrictions throughout the
backcountry and closed some backcountry campsites. Other campsites
and Yellowstone roads remained open.
   In northwest Colorado, all but two of 14 range and forest fires
were contained Tuesday after charring more than 20,000 acres. The
largest fire yet to be contained covered 3,130 acres near the
Dinosaur National Monument headquarters, said Mary Pressley, a U.S.
Bureau of Land Management spokeswoman.
   Northern California firefighters struggled to contain brush and
timber blazes that broke out as temperatures soared above 100
degrees.
   A 1,500-acre fire three miles south of the Calaveras County
community of West Point swept over a state pumper crew Tuesday
after they ran out of water, said California Department of Forestry
spokeswoman Karen Terrill.
   But the four firefighters survived because they took refuge in
heat-resistant shelters they carried with them, she said. None was
injured.
   Two houses, a mobile home and several outbuildings were
destroyed by a second, 2,500-acre blaze five miles to the south, a
forestry department spokesman said.
   Near San Luis Obispo, Calif., dense thickets of 100-year-old
undergrowth, sweltering temperatures and fatigue have hampered
efforts to contain a 4,200-acre wildfire in the Los Padres National
Forest.
   Firefighters had nearly contained the fire Tuesday following an
all-out air and ground assault by 1,000 firefighters.

<HEAD>Rain And Thunderstorms Rumble Over Much Of The Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms poured rain on much of the nation today, flooding
sections of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New Mexico after
a severe storm in which a New York City man died.
   Urban flooding was reported in southeast New York, northern New
Jersey, northeast Pennsylvania and Hobbs, N.M., where very heavy
rainfall continued into the morning.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from southern New England to
southeast New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
the Virginias, Ohio, Kentucky, southern Indiana and southern
Illinois, from Minnesota to Arkansas, and over northern Texas, New
Mexico and southern Arizona.
   In New York City on Tuesday night, a 32-year-old Staten Island
man died after being hit on the head by bricks that fell from a
building struck by lightning, police said.
   Heat blistered many parts of the country Tuesday, increasing the
threat of wildfires.
   In California, a firefighting crew narrowly escaped death as new
brush and timber blazes broke out in the 100-plus degree heat that
baked drought-parched Northern California.
   The 400-acre Bridge Fire three miles south of the Calaveras
County community of West Point swept over a state pumper crew after
they ran out of water, but the four firefighters survived because
they took refuge in heat-resistant shelters they carried with them,
officials said.
   In central Oregon, a forest and grass fire quickly spread to 50
acres northeast of Prineville, aided by heat and strong winds,
state forestry workers said.
   The fire was the second in as many days in Oregon as the state
faced its first major heat wave of the summer, with temperatures
soaring to the 90s and 100s Tuesday.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms extending
from southern New York to northern Virginia, from the Ohio Valley
to Tennessee, over lower Michigan, eastern Wisconsin, Illinois,
southeastern Missouri, northeast Texas, the lower Mississippi
Valley, the central Gulf Coast and Florida.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s and 80s over much of
the nation; in the 90s from southeast New York to Florida, the
central Gulf Coast, Louisiana, southern Texas, southern New Mexico,
and the Pacific Northwest; from 100 to near 115 from southern
Oregon to southwest Idaho, northern California, eastern California
and the Desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Laramie and Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 96
degrees near Phoenix, Ariz.

   Palestinians attacked soldiers, stoned buses
and closed shops today to protest the unsolved killing of a
teen-ager. Israeli troops fatally shot two demonstrators and
wounded seven.
   The army said troops fatally shot one Palestinian as he tried to
throw a firebomb at a military patrol. The other died in
circumstances that were still under investigation.
   Police in Jerusalem fired rubber bullets and tear gas at
hundreds of Palestinian protesters, including children in a
schoolyard near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, where tradition
says Jesus is buried.
   The violence was triggered by Tuesday's shooting death of
15-year-old Nidal Fuad Rabadi as he rode his bicycle near Jerusalem
city limits, and by a tour of the Temple Mount today by right-wing
Israeli legislators.
   Arab reporters and Israel Television said the boy may have been
shot by Israeli civilians who got off a bus to chase stone-throwing
youths.
   The fatalities raised to 227 the number of Palestinians killed
since the uprising began Dec. 8 against Israel's 21-year occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four Israelis also have died.
   The army said a Palestinian identified by hospital officials as
Zaki Halaykeh, 23, was killed when he tried to throw a firebomb at
a military patrol in Shuyukh village near the West Bank city of
Hebron.
   Officals at nearby Alia Hospital said Halaykeh was shot through
the back. Three other youths in Shuyukh were wounded in a clash
with troops, the army said.
   In the northern West Bank town of Jenin, Hisham Zaid, 26, died
after being shot in the chest by troops during a stone throwing, an
official at Jenin Hospital said. Four Palestinians were wounded in
the clash, the army said.
   Violence broke out in Jerusalem shortly after three legislators
of the Tehiya Party toured the Temple Mount under heavy police
guard. The compound is sacred to both Jews and Moslems.
   Legislator Geula Cohen told reporters the tour was to coincide
with the Hebrew lunar calendar month of Av, when the ancient Jewish
temple was destroyed by the Romans about 2,000 years ago.
   In Arab east Jerusalem today, police blocked Rabadi's friends
from paying condolence calls to his family home and merchants
staged a strike, refusing to open their stores on the main Salah
Eddin shopping street.
   Palestinian shopkeeper Abed Alka said protesters in the Old City
shouted slogans such as ``Whose state is Palestine?''
   More than 50 Palestinian aged 6 to 8 fled the Al Aytem School
when soldiers fired tear gas.
   Angry protesters stoned Israeli buses, including one carrying
tourists, an Arab-owned vehicle and a police van. Israel radio said
a woman and a policeman were injured by rocks.
   An investigation into the circumstances of Rabadi's death was
delayed by a disagreement between police and army officials over
whether the shooting occurred within Jerusalem's city limits, where
Israeli law applies.
   Police officials contend the army is responsible for the West
Bank.
   Jerusalem Police Chief Yossi Yehudai told reporters today that
he had visited the site of the shooting, near the Arab neighborhood
of Beit Hanina, but found no witnesses to the attack.
   Yehudai did not rule out the possibility the killing was linked
the Palestinian uprising, but said he also believed ``this could be
a criminal case.'' He refused to elaborate.
   Also today, the head of Jerusalem's Moslem religious council,
Sheikh Salah El Din Al Alami, met diplomats from eight countries
including the United States and urged them to intervene to halt an
Israeli archaeological excavation beneath the Temple Mount compound.
   The dig to uncover an ancient tunnel touched off a violent
demonstration in the Old City two weeks ago.
   Israel's state television decided it would no longer cover
Israelis protesting military service in the occupied territories,
the Jerusalem Post reported. Since the uprising began, 29 Israelis
have served jail terms for refusing to serve in the disputed lands.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would cut services to
Palestinians in the occupied territories because of a 40 percent
decline in tax collections during the uprising, army radio reported.

<HEAD>Bodies of Three Children, Man Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIPLEY, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bodies of three children and an adult
who drowned trying to save them were found a day after they were
swept into the Mississippi River from a drought-weakened sandbar
that apparently collapsed, authorities said.
   The bodies were taken Tuesday night to Baptist Hospital here,
where family members identified them, said hospital personnel
director Peggy Holmes.
   The victims were identified as Erika Gould, 5; her 6-year-old
brother Chris; Rusty May, 2, and his father, Ed May, 33, all of
Lauderdale County.
   The children were apparently swept into the river Monday evening
as May and Lyndell Gould Jr., the Gould children's father, worked
nearby on an all-terrain vehicle, said Lauderdale County Chief
Sheriff's Deputy Charles Love.
   Gould, a county sheriff's investigator, had been riding one
all-terrain vehicle with his children and May was on another with
his son before they stopped on the sandbar to make repairs, Love
said.
   The three children had gone to the water's edge to cool off
while the men worked, Love said. When the youngsters disapeared,
their fathers began searching for them in the growing darkness.
   ``They looked around and the kids weren't there. Ed and Lyn
jumped in the river and Ed never did come up,'' he said.
   Gould, who dived into the river several times after May went
under, was released Tuesday from Baptist Hospital after treatment
for shock and exhaustion.
   Nearly 100 rescue workers and volunteers used at least 10 boats
to drag the river for the four, and the Highway Patrol searched by
helicopter.
   The four disappeared in an area 54 miles north of Memphis and 13
miles west of Ripley.
   A towboat that passed by just minutes before the men noticed the
children gone could have created an undertow, Love said. Also, the
river drops off sharply where the three children stood, he said.
The sandbar is behind a dike that creates a whirlpool, Love said.
   ``There's a lot of current down there. The swirling motion from
the dike could have carried them back up the river,'' he said.
   Three people drowned near Natchez, Miss., last month when a
sandbar they were walking on collapsed. Since the Mississippi began
falling to record lows this summer, hundreds of sightseers and
souvenir hunters have been drawn to the river. The U.S. Coast Guard
has issued warnings advising people to stay clear of sandbars
uncovered by the low water.
   ``When the river falls it makes sandbars accessible to people,
and they're sometimes undermined by the current underneath,'' Coast
Guard Petty Officer Garland McDowell said.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements was in good condition
today after suffering a mild stroke, and will remain hospitalized
two to three days for observation and testing, aides said.
   ``He's walking around joking (and) says he's going to have some
ice cream,'' chief of staff George Bayoud said Tuesday night. ``The
governor is wide awake. If you saw him right now ... he looks
absolutely normal.''
   The 71-year-old Republican complained of illness before
admitting himself into Seton Medical Center around 6:30 p.m.
Tuesday. He was listed in good condition today.
   The stroke briefly blurred Clements' vision, but his vision was
normal late Tuesday night, gubenatorial spokesman Reggie Bashur
said, adding that he had spoken with neurologist Dr. Jerry Tindel.
   Clements had appeared in good spirits earlier Tuesday when he
posed for photographs with the 1987 Miss Texas.
   Bayoud said he was in his office when Clements walked in Tuesday
afternoon and said he was not feeling well and was going to see his
doctor.
   Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby, at the Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta, placed a call to Clements, but didn't talk to him, Bayoud
said, adding there was no reason for the state's second-in-command
to return to Texas early.
   The governor was expected to remain at Seton for two to three
days for observation, Bashur said. Aspirin was the only medication
being administered.
   Bayoud said that to his knowledge, Clements had not been
admitted to a hospital since hip surgery in 1983.
   Clements was first elected in 1978, becoming Texas' first
Republican governor since Reconstruction. He was ousted by Democrat
Mark White in 1982, but defeated White four years later.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said today
that accepting a U.N. resolution calling for a cease-fire in the
Iran-Iraq war was ``worse than drinking poison,'' but that Iran's
political leaders recommended it be done.
   It was the first statement from the 87-year-old leader since
Iran announced Monday it was accepting the resolution passed by the
Security Council on July 20, 1987.
   Iraq called the announcement a trick to buy time.
   Also today, an Iraqi military spokesman said two Iranian jet
fighters tried to bomb the Dokan Dam near the northern city of
Kirkuk but were chased off by anti-aircraft fire.
   The jets dropped their bombs but missed the target, according to
Iraqi press reports monitored in Cyprus. The spokesman was not
identified.
   Iran and Iraq have been at war since September 1980.
   Khomeini said he could not detail the reasons why the country's
political leaders asked him to end the war but said he decided to
accept their recommendation. He did not refer to any leaders by
name.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament and
commander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, said Monday that
Khomeini made the decision to accept the resolution.
   Khomeini had previously rejected all attempts to end the war,
saying Iran would continue fighting until Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein was overthrown.
   Resolution 598 calls for a cease-fire in the war, a return to
the international borders of 1980, an exchange of prisoners and an
investigation to determine who started the conflict.
   Khomeini, in a statement carried by Iranian media and monitored
in Nicosia, said accepting the resolution does not mean the war is
over.
   ``The approval of the U.N. resolution does not mean that the
problem of the war has been solved,'' his statement said.
   Khomeini said many of his country's problems could be traced to
American opposition to the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   He said Iran will continue to battle American influence in the
region and said that foreign navies should leave the gulf.
   ``I hearby warn the American and European military forces to
leave the Persian Gulf before it is too late,'' he said.
   In the gulf, shipping sources confirmed that Iraq bombed an
unfinished nuclear plant at the Iranian port of Bushehr and an
unfinished petrochemical plant at Bandar Khomeini in the northern
gulf.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
petrochemical complex was still burning late Tuesday.
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee
said the United States could begin pulling its warships out of the
gulf as soon as a cease-fire takes effect.
   Rep. William Dickinson of Alabama spoke during a visit to the
gulf Tuesday.
   ``The extraction of our forces is going to be very simple,'' he
said in an interview. ``We don't have anything on the ground. All
we have to do is wind that ship up and go.''
   Until a year ago, the United States had had a small naval force
in the gulf since 1948. Now it has 27 warships in the region, about
17 of them in the gulf at any time.
   War communiques from Tehran said the Iraqi raids at Bushehr and
Bandar Khomeini were ``barbaric'' and that Iranian warplanes
retaliated by raiding a dam at Lake Darbandikhan near Kirkuk, 140
miles northeast of Baghdad.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said Iran's decision to
accept the Security Council resolution was ``two-faced'' and
``aiming at winning time to launch surprise offensives'' in the
war, which began in September 1980.
   Iran said the Iraqi air raids were proof Baghdad opposes an end
to the war.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the head
of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Reza Amrollahi, as saying the
Iraqi raid on the nuclear plant inflicted ``heavy losses.''
   Amrollahi said in a letter to the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency it was the seventh attack on the unfinished
facility in four years, the news agency reported.

<HEAD>Italian Arms-Maker Sues U.S. Carmaker Over `Beretta' Name</HEAD>

   Beretta, the Italian arms manufacturer favored
by James Bond, is gunning for General Motors Corp., claiming in a
$250 million lawsuit that the automaker's four-wheeled Beretta is a
trademark violation.
   Fabrica D'Armi P. Beretta S.p.A., which calls itself the oldest
manufacturer of arms in the world, went after GM when the automaker
unveiled the Chevrolet Beretta in 1987, despite warning letters
from Beretta lawyers the previous year.
   The 500-year-old Italian arms-making dynasty had registered
trademarks in this country for the Beretta name as far back as 1954.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court here Tuesday, said Beretta
pistols are the standard military sidearm in several countries
including the United States, which signed an $80 million contract
for 315,000 pistols in 1985.
   It also noted that in novels, where price is no object, the
Italian-made pistols are the weapon of choice for numerous
fictional spies and detectives, including Agent 007.
   In Detroit, General Motors issued a statement saying that ``no
basis for the suit exists because there is no likelihood for
confusion as to the source of those vehicles between GM and the
Beretta gun company.''
   ``The GM employee who selected the Beretta name was unaware of
the existence of the Beretta gun company,'' the automaker said.
``Moreover, in the United States it is not uncommon that vehicle
models and firearms have the same names, such as Colt and Marlin.''
   Beretta's lawsuit, claiming that the Beretta automobile is ``the
subject of a recall'' and ``possibly can cause'' serious harm, also
charged that the car's problems could cause further damage to the
Beretta weapons business.
   GM spokesman James W. Crellin said the Beretta, a compact sport
coupe, has had ``two minor recalls'' for a hood latch and a
headlamp switch.
   The Italian company makes luggage, clothing, cutlery and optical
equipment as well as target, hunting and military guns.

   Soviet inspectors today began
inspecting U.S. nuclear missiles at two British bases, Greenham
Common and Molesworth, the U.S. military said.
   The 20-member Soviet team arrived Tuesday from Moscow for the
first inspection of bases in Britain under the superpower arms
treaty to dismantle medium-range nuclear missiles.
   Soviet team leader Vyacheslav S. Lebedev detailed the inspection
plan to Col. John Fer of the U.S. On-Site Inspection Agency.
   Half of the Soviets remained at Greenham, which has 96 missiles
and five spares, and the rest traveled on a three-hour bus ride to
Molesworth, near Cambridge, which has 16 missiles.
   Greenham Common is 50 miles west of London. Molesworth is 50
miles north of London.
   The Soviet inspectors spent the night at refurbished
servicemen's quarters at the heart of the Greenham Common base.
   On Tuesday night, U.S. officers took the team on a bus tour of
the base. It included a visit to a gift shop, the Black Knight,
where they bought small British souvenirs using American currency.
   Peace protesters who have camped outside the Greenham Common
base since before cruise missiles began arriving from the United
States in November 1983 said they wanted to give a letter to the
visiting Soviets.
   The liberal Guardian newspaper said the letter read in Russian:
``We are glad you are making a start on dismantling these terrible
weapons. We hope it's the beginning of total disarmament.''
   Lebedev said Tuesday that since the inspections began this month
in the United States, the Soviet Union and West Germany, no one
seemed to be cheating.
   ``The experience of the inspections has shown that the U.S.S.R.
and United States strictly implemented the treaty signed by them
and the first steps as to its realization are successful,'' he said.
   He spoke through an interpreter from behind a podium emblazoned
with the emblem of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The Greenham Common base commander, Col. Richard. R. Riddick,
promised the Soviet inspectors help ``in carrying out your
specified duties.''
   The inspections are part of a 60-day period of inspections that
started July 1 to check whether each side told the truth about
deployments.
   The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States and five
Western European countries, while U.S. inspectors are visiting 133
Soviet sites. No violations have been reported.
   The Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, signed in December,
provides for the elimination of all land-based missiles in Europe
with ranges of 300 to 3,000 miles.
   Each side has the right to make 20 short-notice inspections a
year at bases until 1991, when all the missiles and their launchers
should have been destroyed, and to make periodic inspections for a
decade thereafter.
   The Soviets have the right to enter any buildings they suspect
could accommodate missiles and additionally can post inspectors at
base gates to ensure no missiles are removed.
   The missiles and their 55-foot mobile launchers are housed in
bunkers. The Soviets will not see the warheads, which do not have
to be destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviets told the Americans on Monday evening that they were
coming Tuesday under terms of the 16-hour notice each side must
give. They are allowed 24 hours for each inspection and can ask for
eight more hours. They must submit a report before they leave.

<HEAD>Acquittal Does Not Solve Mystery Of Nipon Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a jury cleared a young man in
the machine-gun slayings of two relatives of fashion designer
Albert Nipon, a prosecutor said officials were still seeking
evidence against others who might be involved.
   Michael Wolcoff heaved a sigh of relief Tuesday after a Broward
Circuit Court jury cleared him of murdering Edward and Sylvia Nipon
of Hallandale.
   ``It's hard for an American jury to convict a 20-year-old kid
who may have been peripherally involved if they don't know
specifically what happened,'' defense attorney T. Don TenBrook said
after the verdict.
   Nipon, 58, retired president of his brother's designer clothing
company, Albert Nipon Inc., and his 67-year-old wife were shot to
death at their beachfront condominium in 1987. Prosecutors
described the slayings as ``a professional hit.''
   Wolcoff was identified as one of two people who visited the
Nipons the night they were killed, and Assistant State Attorney
Chuck Morton argued that although Wolcoff did not shoot the Nipons,
he played a key role in the plot.
   The scheme was devised by Sylvia Nipon's son-in-law, Bernard
Rubin, the prosecutor said.
   Rubin had borrowed about $100,000 from Edward Nipon for a
loan-sharking or money-laundering scheme, Morton said. When Nipon
demanded his money back, Rubin feared he would go to authorities
and ordered that the couple be killed, the prosecutor said.
   Rubin and another suspect in the deaths, reputed mob hit man
Stanley Diamond, have not been charged, although Morton said
investigators continue to seek evidence against them.
   Wolcoff's lawyer argued that his client was a pawn used by the
killers to mislead and confuse the police. Court testimony never
revealed who the triggerman was.
   More clues about the killings may surface during the August
trial of Michael Wolcoff's father, Burton Wolcoff, who also faces
murder charges in the Nipons' deaths.
   Burton Wolcoff helped hide the weapon and a diamond pinky ring
taken from Edward Nipon the night he was killed, Morton said during
the younger Wolcoff's trial.
   Morton tried to convince jurors that they did not need to know
who the killer was. Wolcoff was still part of the plan and,
therefore, guilty, he said.
   ``It doesn't legally matter who pulled the trigger,'' Morton
said in closing arguments. ``Don't let Michael Wolcoff get away
with murder.''
   ``(Wolcoff) knows too much about details,'' Morton said. ``He
knew how and why and who the killer was to be.''
   Michael Wolcoff was identified as the man dressed in black who
drove up to the Nipons' condominium and visited the couple the
night they died, and both lawyers surmised that Wolcoff was
carrying a payoff of some kind to Nipon.
   TenBrook said he thought the killer arrived after Wolcoff left,
but no witnesses explained what exactly happened that night and why.
   TenBrook said he thinks it is unlikely that Rubin, now serving
time in federal prison for labor racketeering, will be tried for
the killings.
   ``Who pulled the trigger?'' TenBrook said. ``I don't have the
slightest idea.''

<HEAD>Park Service: Memorial Scar Six Years Old</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service says a scratch
noticed by a park ranger on the Vietnam Memorial last weekend is a
flaw in the stone work and has been there since the memorial was
erected six years ago.
   Officials at first said the vertical scratch was the result of
vandalism, which would have been the second defacing of the black
granite wall in two months.
   But on Tuesday park service spokeswoman Sandra Alley said:
   ``We're confident it has been on the memorial since 1982. We're
both relieved and embarrassed.''
   Park service authorities initially concluded after Ranger James
Lance reported the four-inch-long mark on Sunday that it was the
work of vandals. They said the wall with its 58,156 names of
Vietnam War dead is so hard that the scratch had to be deliberate.
   Lance, who has been assigned to the wall since October, said he
first noticed the scratch Sunday morning.
   ``It's one of those things. You walk by 20 times and never see
it and then one time it hits you between the eyes,'' he said.
   The memorial is the most popular in Washington and attracts
12,000 to 15,000 visitors a day.
   Authorities said complaints poured in Monday after news reports
of what they had thought was vandalism. In May, multiple scratches
discovered on three of the memorial's 140 panels prompted a similar
outcry. The previous scratches have yet to be repaired.

<HEAD>Police Search For Stolen Dynamite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal, state and city authorities searched the
city today for a van loaded with more than 100 pounds of stolen
dynamite after a telephone caller reportedly told police it would
be used to bomb an abortion clinic.
   There was no indication the theft was related to the Democratic
National Convention, said police spokeswoman Myrna May.
   The tan van involved in the heist was reportedly sighted in
several locations around the city, including the state Capitol and
The Omni, where the convention that brought 35,000 visitors to the
city was being held, Ms. May said.
   Atlanta Police Sgt. G.E. Smith, assigned to the convention
command center, said no arrests had been made.
   The dynamite was stolen early Tuesday from a suburban blasting
company by a ski-masked bandit, officials said.
   The Atlanta Constitution, quoting unidentified sources, said
police received a call saying the dynamite would be used against an
abortion clinic. Police had been warned that an abortion clinic
would be blown up during the convention, the newspaper said.
   Atlanta police and convention security officers were alerted to
the theft by the Henry County Sheriff's Department. Sheriff's Capt.
Keith McBrayer said two cases, each containing 50 pounds of
dynamite, or about 200 sticks, and 200 blasting caps were taken.
   The FBI, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service
and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have joined
police from Atlanta and Henry County in the search, officials said.
   ``They've detected no connection with the convention,'' said GBI
spokesman John Bankhead. ``But the convention security people are
certainly aware of this.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Keeps Low Profile But Family's A Busy Bunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' 84-year-old mother, one of a
slew of family members who will watch Democratic delegates nominate
the Massachusetts governor as the party's presidential candidate,
said today the convention experience is awesome.
   Euterpe Dukakis also said she has derived joy and pleasure in
promoting her son among the thousands of people attending the
convention.
   While Dukakis has kept a relatively low profile awaiting his
coronation as the Democratic nominee, his family has been busy
rallying delegates, meeting the media and enjoying heaps of
Southern hospitality.
   ``It is certainly very awesome in the old sense of the word,
very awesome, and exciting...,'' Euterpe Dukakis said about the
convention. ``The reception that my son is getting, the responses
that he is getting are very gratifying,'' she said on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America.''
   Kitty Dukakis, the candidate's wife, said some of her
experiences in this city have been ``so special I can't even
articulate how much it has meant to me and to us.''
   Kitty Dukakis' convention duties have included network
television interviews, an appearance before black delegates,
meetings with state delegations and a discussion with
Asian-Americans about her work on behalf of refugees.
   Her children have kept a hectic pace as well, but her husband,
the Massachusetts governor, generally has appeared at only one
public event a day and spent much of each day rehearsing his
Thursday night acceptance speech and holding private meetings at
his hotel. One such meeting was Monday's peacemaking session with
rival Jesse Jackson.
   That session has allowed the Dukakis family members to preach a
common theme: party unity.
   ``We may have traveled different paths to get here, but if we
are to win we must go forward together,'' Mrs. Dukakis told
Asian-American delegates Tuesday.
   Mrs. Dukakis delivered a similar message a day earlier, at a
barbecue with black delegates just hours after her husband and
Jackson emerged smiling from their summit.
   ``We all go forward, together, on the same team to victory in
November,'' Mrs. Dukakis said. Referring to Inauguration Day, she
added: ``We look forward to being together with all of you on a
colder day in January.''
   Campaigning is nothing new to the Dukakis clan. But Atlanta has
put them under a bigger spotlight, with an audience of more than
4,000 delegates and more than 13,000 representatives of the news
media.
   For son John Dukakis, Tuesday was `M' day, with morning visits
to the delegations from Missouri, Massachusetts and Michigan.
   ``Please recognize that you are ambassadors to all the other
delegations,'' he told delegates from his home state.
   He professed to be having the time of his life.
   ``This is the greatest week you could ever imagine for all of
us,'' he said.
   At a meeting of North Carolina delegates, he said Jackson and
his constituents are welcome members of the Dukakis campaign.
   ``The convention that America sees ... will reflect the
principles of fairness, inclusion and full participation that Mike
Dukakis has supported for his entire adult life,'' he said.
   Mrs. Dukakis and daughters Andrea and Kara spent Tuesday with an
alphabet soup of delegations. Between them, they visited delegates
from Florida, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Alaska, North Carolina,
Utah and Kentucky.
   At the Florida stop, Mrs. Dukakis was greeted by Wilma
Greenfield, her ``oldest friend,'' and Susan Guber, a grade-school
classmate of Dukakis.
   Kara Dukakis, a Brown University student who organized a
Students for Dukakis there, held a student reception Tuesday.
Andrea, who spent months in chilly Iowa preparing for its February
caucuses, took time during a scorching week in Atlanta to meet with
the National Rural Caucus.
   Lisa Dukakis, John's wife, also got into the act, including a
visit to the Kentucky delegation. She has now ``announced'' her
pregnancy to a party of Democrats.
   They aren't the only Dukakises in town.
   Another is Olympia Dukakis, who urged on her cousin Michael when
she accepted an Oscar earlier this year for her supporting role in
the movie ``Moonstruck.'' She will introduce Dukakis to the
delegates waiting for him to accept the nomination.

   Landslides and flooding caused by
torrential rains left 25 people dead or missing today, a government
agency said.
   The National Counter-Disaster Center said 16 people were
confirmed killed and nine were missing and presumed dead.
   News reports said about 650 houses were flooded and 2,640 people
were evacuated to schools and other temporary shelters after the
latest downpours, which dropped nearly eight inches of rain.
   Officials said that since the rainy season began July 8, 32
people have died and 10 are missing. Property damage was estimated
at $45 million.
   Six people, including four children under 12 years old, were
killed when landslides buried three homes in Yongwol, 75 miles east
of Seoul, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymnity.
   A taxi careened off a road and plunged into a flooded river in
Chechon, 65 miles south of Seoul. Two passengers were killed and
two were rescued, officials said.
   In the southern Youngju city, three family members, including
two children, were killed when a landslide smashed their house, the
officials said.
   Other deaths were caused by floods and landslides, and rescue
workers were digging through debris for possible survivors.
   Train service on the Taebaek and Jungang Railway lines in
eastern South Korea was suspended because some sections of track
were under water or washed away.

   An IRA guerrilla serving a life sentence
for the 1979 assassination of British statesman Earl Mountbatten of
Burma fired a gun inside a Dublin courthouse today, but no one was
injured, police said.
   Thomas McMahon, 40, pulled out a gun in a second-floor cell in
Dublin's High Court and fired one shot that struck a wall before he
was overpowered by two guards, police said.
   A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it
was not immediately clear how McMahon acquired the weapon.
   McMahon was later escorted to a courtroom to testify in his case
against the administrator of Portlaoise Prison. McMahon filed suit
after allegedly suffering a broken wrist during a strip search in
1983.
   McMahon, of Carrickmacross in County Monaghan, has been serving
a life sentence at the high-security prison since his conviction in
November 1979.
   Mountbatten, cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and the last British
viceroy of India, was killed Aug. 27, 1979, in a bomb blast aboard
his yacht off the coast of Ireland. Three other people were killed
in the bombing.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army said it carried out the
killing as part of its campaign to oust the British from Northern
Ireland and reunite the province with the predominantly Catholic
republic of Ireland.

   Jesse Jackson promised today to endorse Michael
Dukakis and to campaign enthusiastically in the fall election,
though he is still asking the Democratic convention to nominate him
for president tonight ``as a testament to the struggles of our
fathers and mothers.''
   For 50 minutes Tuesday night, in a valedictory for his own
campaign, Jackson praised Dukakis in careful phrases and appealed
to both Jackson and Dukakis supporters to find common ground.
   ``We meet tonight at a crossroads, a point of decision. Shall we
expand, be inclusive, find unity and power, or suffer division and
impotence?'' he asked the delegates, then answered his own
question: ``The only time we win is when we come together.''
   Today, Jackson finally answered without equivocation the
question that had tormented the party since it became clear that
Dukakis would win the roll call tonight: Is Jackson going to
endorse the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and campaign enthusiastically
for it?
   ``Oh yes, I am,'' Jackson said on ABC-TV. ``But in some sense
the relationship I will have with the campaign must be defined by
Governor Dukakis. This is true for Mario Cuomo. This is true for
Ted Kennedy. This is true for Lane Kirkland.''
   With the acknowledgement of Dukakis' win-to-come _ but still
without a formal endorsement _ Jackson still appeared a little
bitter that his path-breaking efforts did not result in victory.
   ``The fact is we are fighting a cultural crisis. The fact is if
any other candidate had campaigned as hard as I did, campaigned
against those odds and achieved as much, that person no doubt would
probably be the nominee or certainly on the ticket,'' Jackson said
on NBC-TV.
   ``And so it becomes my challenge, just as Fannie Lou Hamer had
to keep knocking and pushing down doors, through barriers, and just
as Dr. King had to do it, I'm still doing it and I'm determined to
push those doors down and I may, I may not get through those doors,
but my children and your children will get through those doors and
the White House is within reach. ... I am pushing back barriers and
removing ceilings off of dreams every day. I see it as my
obligation, in a real sense now my mission.''
   He said after his speech Tuesday night that he felt a great
burden in writing it. ``Whether I was successful would determine
whether we could pull this convention together,'' he said.
   Jackson saluted Dukakis for ``a well-managed and dignified
campaign.''
   ``No matter how tired or how tried, he always resisted the
temptation to stoop to demagoguery,'' Jackson said.
   He also emphasized the significance of his own presidential bid
that won 7 million votes, crossing lines of race, economic stature
and geography.
   He was personal and emotional, recalling at one point that in
his own boyhood he ate no turkey on Thanksgiving ``because Momma
was off cooking someone else's turkey.''
   His argument with Dukakis is settled, but he is going ahead in a
contest for the nomination for the historical significance of the
moment. He came closer to winning the presidential nomination of a
major party than any black person in history.
   ``When you see Jesse Jackson, when my name goes in nomination
your name goes in nomination,'' he said.
   Reciting familiar details of his humble beginnings, Jackson
identified himself with the poor, minorities and the underclass,
saying, ``I know abandonment, and people being mean to you and
saying you are nothing and nobody and can never be anything. I
understand.''
   Of Dukakis, he said: ``I have watched a good mind fast at work,
with steel nerves, guiding his campaign out of the crowded field
without appeal to the worst of us. I have watched his perspective
grow as his environment has expanded. I've seen his toughness and
tenacity close up.''
   Jackson's speech lacked some of the fire that he is capable of
producing, but it won plaudits from the Dukakis campaign and
observers including the party's 1984 nominee, Walter Mondale.
   At the end of the speech, Jackson seemed reluctant to leave the
hall, lingering for several minutes to take questions in a crush of
reporters and cameras crammed at one side of the floor.
   ``I was impressed beyond words,'' said Elaine Flynn, a Dukakis
delegate from Oakridge, N.J. ``I thought he gave everybody hope.''
   ``It was vintage Jesse, Jesse's valedictory address,'' said
another admiring Dukakis delegatee, Florida floor whip Clay
Henderson of Daytona Beach.
   Jackson was introduced by his five children and by a brief film
highlighting his campaign, and a sea of red ``Jesse!'' signs waved
across the hall. Dukakis aides urged that the blue Dukakis signs be
kept down during the speech and some Dukakis delegates gave up
their seats to Jackson alternates to give them a better view.
   Discussing Dukakis, Jackson noted their dissimilar backgrounds.
   ``His foreparents came to America in immigrant ships. My
foreparents came to America on slave ships. But whatever the
original ships, we are both in the same boat tonight.''
   Speaking of the slain civil rights leader who was his mentor,
Jackson said Dr. Martin Luther King's ``heart would be full
tonight.''
   Jackson closed his speech with what has become a slogan for him
and for his political efforts for the future: ``Keep hope alive,''
he exhorted. ``Keep hope alive.''

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Buddy Roemer has reversed himself
and vetoed legislation restricting the display of bumper stickers
deemed obscene.
   One bill listed specific words and said they could not appear on
bumper stickers in letters larger than one-eighth inch. A second
measure would have banned all words or pictures ruled obscene by
the courts on bumper stickers.
   Roemer first said he liked the bills, but killed them Tuesday,
citing First Amendment guarantees.
   ``It is just unconstitutional,'' the governor said. ``It could
cost us a ton'' of money to defend the laws in court.
   The Louisiana chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union had
said it would go to court if Roemer signed either bill.
   In his veto message, Roemer said: ``The intent of this
legislation is excellent, and I fully agree with the concept of
same. I personally find such public display of the prohibited words
extremely offensive.
   ``But after consultation between my legal staff and
representatives of the attorney general's office, I have been
advised that there is little chance that this statute will
withstand constitutional scrutiny.''

   The sheriff has been hearing a lot about
the Lizard Man, 7 feet tall with red eyes and three fingers on each
hand, but a state biologist says everybody would be better off
looking for a red fox or a muddy drunk.
   Christopher Davis, 17, told Sheriff Liston Truesdale he had been
attacked several weeks ago by the creature in Scape Ore Swamp as
the teen-ager was changing a flat tire about 2 a.m.
   The swamp was swamped Tuesday with TV crews and other curious
people hoping to catch a glimpse. Truesdale said he is getting
other calls from people who said they saw the creature, ``and these
are reputable people.''
   ``We're running down a whole lot of rumors, but we'll cover what
we can,'' the sheriff said. Davis has agreed to undergo hypnosis to
see if he can remember more.
   Truesdale called in biologist Matt Knox of the state Wildlife
and Marine Resources Department after Tom and Mary Waye reported
their car had been ``chewed up'' last week.
   The sheriff said he found tracks Tuesday near the the couple's
house. He said the tracks don't belong to a cow or deer but could
be a bear's.
   Knox said the tracks and short hairs he found on the chrome and
molding of the car led him to conclude the animal was a red fox. He
said samples were sent to the University of Georgia for analysis.
Knox also interviewed Davis,
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's no wild animal,'' Knowx said.
``All I can guess is it was a man, possibly a drunk'' who had been
lying in the muddy ditch and got up when Davis pulled over to
change his tire.
   ``From time to time, we get sightings of bears or Eastern
cougars. But bears aren't green, and they don't have red eyes,''
the biologist said.
   Columbia radio station WCOS has offered a $1 million reward for
the capture of the Lizard Man.
   ``Some are taking it seriously, and some are not,'' midday
announcer Ron Hicks said. But, he said, if someone arrives at the
station with the creature, ``we'll probably all be eating a lot of
lizard.''

   At least 40 people suffered broken bones
or heat exhaustion after the crowd surged toward the stage at a
rock concert, authorities said.
   The incident occurred at Greenville Memorial Auditorium just
before the start of a concert Tuesday night featuring David Lee
Roth and Poison.
   ``They got caught up in the action, scared to death, being
pushed up against the stage. They were sort of crushed between the
crowd and the stage, and they couldn't breathe real good because of
that,'' said Pat Browning, county Emergency Medical Service
director.
   Several spectators suffered broken bones, EMS said. The building
is air conditioned, but the crush of people made the temperature
soar in front of the stage, said Clifford Gray, executive director
of the auditorium.
   Four ambulances were called to the auditorium and an infirmary
was set up, Gray said. Nine people were taken to Greenville
Memorial Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   ``Those people (the crowd) just don't have any regard for human
life,'' said Inez Jones, whose daughter Terry was one of those
treated at the hospital.

<HEAD>20,000 Children May Be Infected By AIDS Virus by 1991,
Pediatrician Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   By 1991, children infected by the AIDS virus may
occupy as many as one in 10 of the nation's pediatric hospital
beds, an AIDS researcher says.
   The number of infected children could reach 10,000 to 20,000 by
then, and infected children might occupy one in 15 to one in 10
pediatric beds, James Oleske said Tuesday at a science writers
conference sponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   Not all of them, however, would have full-blown acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, Oleske said.
   Oleske said he believes that by 1991 any city with poor people
and intravenous drug abuse ``can unfortunately expect to see
pediatric AIDS developing.''
   The pediatric researcher at the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School in Newark, N.J.,
said his predictions were based on experience caring for infected
children in Newark and on federal statistics.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control has counted 1,065 cases
of AIDS so far in children who were diagnosed while younger than 13.
   CDC has no projections on how many children may become infected
by 1991, but the Atlanta-based agency does expect a cumulative
total of more than 3,000 pediatric AIDS cases by that time, a CDC
spokeswoman said.
   Robert Sweeney, president of the National Association of
Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions, said pediatric AIDS
cases may increase substantially.
   ``It looks like it could pretty well double in this year,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``If they keep doubling, they do
tend to add up.''
   AIDS in children often results from an infected mother, and
Oleske said maternal-child care centers should be established to
care for the mother and child. It is ``preposterous'' that a woman
should have to ``take a crosstown bus'' to get care for herself
after having her child seen by a pediatrician, he said.

<HEAD>Roark, Former W.Va. Mayor, Released From Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PETERSBURG, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Mayor Mike Roark of Charleston,
W.Va., walked out of federal prison today after serving five months
for cocaine possession.
   The 42-year-old former prosecutor nicknamed ``Mad Dog'' for his
flamboyant ways, which included wearing a camouflage jacket and
sidearm on drug raids, was whisked past news cameras at the Federal
Correctional Institute shortly before 8 a.m.
   Warden J.J. Clark said Roark refused to sign consent forms
allowing himself to be interviewed or permitting prison officials
to discuss his incarceration.
   The one-time assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh and Kanawha
County, W.Va., prosecutor pleaded guilty to six counts of cocaine
possession Nov. 17 and resigned as mayor Nov. 24, seven months
after being elected to a second four-year term.
   In January, he was sentenced to 179 days in prison and fined
$5,000. Roark entered prison Feb. 12 and was scheduled for release
Aug. 8. Federal authorities said he was released 18 days early
because he was a model prisoner.
   ``Obviously, he's presented no problems to us,'' Clark said,
adding that Roark worked as a clerk in the prison's education
department.
   Roark left prison in a convertible accompanied by a former aide,
Ed Esposito, and a man prison officials identified as Roark's
brother.
   Roark, once talked up as a Republican gubernatorial candidate,
has said he no longer has a political future in West Virginia. He
has said he wants to return to private practice if if he retains
his law license.
   ``His being a political candidate is about as absurd as electing
me to the papacy,'' said John Charnock, Charleston city attorney
and a close friend of Roark's. Roark hopes to join Charnock's law
firm.
   The state Bar Association is trying to revoke or suspend Roark's
license for breaching legal ethics by possessing and using cocaine.
He faces an Aug. 1 meeting with State Bar investigators.
   ``His mood is good. He'd like to get back to Charleston,''
Charnock said Tuesday.
   Last July, Roark was indicted on 27 cocaine-related counts and
three obstruction counts. He accepted a plea bargain.
   Twice divorced and a father of two, Roark led a highly visible
nightlife in West Virginia's capital. During his more than 4{ years
as mayor, he was dogged by rumors of cocaine use, which he
vehemently denied until he pleaded guilty.
   In an interview with the Charleston Daily Mail published the day
he entered prison, he said: ``I was stupid. ... I was weak. I had
to face the cold, hard facts of what I had done.''
   Roark called his behavior as prosecutor ``hypocritical'' but
denied his cocaine use affected his actions as prosecutor or mayor.
   ``You know, I was up at the top of the ladder, and now I'm at
the bottom of the ladder,'' Roark said in February. ``As far as I'm
concerned, the political, public life of Mike Roark is over.''

   It finally became obvious that there are too many
journalists at this Democratic National Convention when a horde of
reporters _ this one included _ began interviewing People With
Boxes On Their Heads.
   ``We're just a bunch of guys standing around with boxes on their
heads,'' said one of the three men with cardboard boxes on their
heads, who identified himself as Guy With A Box On His Head.
   He and his two fellow People With Boxes On Their Heads were just
three of the ... well ... interesting folks hanging around the
city's official demonstration zone _ actually a two-acre blacktop
parking lot _ on Tuesday, during Day 2 of the convention.
   When asked where the People With Boxes On Their Heads were
based, the Guy With A Box On His Head replied, ``Here.''
   When asked what he stood for, Guy replied, ``Nothing.''
   And when asked why he had a box on his head, he replied,
``That's the name of our organization, dammit!''
   But they don't like to be called ``Boxheads'' because they
consider it a racial slur, Guy said.
   A cynic suspected he was actually a journalist who had been in
the sun too long. He wore a distinctive chain and plastic pouch
around his neck, used by journalists, delegates and staff to carry
credentials for the convention. However, where his credential
should have been was the plastic card from his hotel door: ``PLEASE
MAKE UP ROOM NOW.''
   Later into the demonstration zone came Pastor Edgar Mallett of
the Prayer & Faith Church Of The First Born in Chicago, acclaimed _
at least on the sign he carried _ as ``The World's Greatest
Demonstrator For 16 Years.''
   Mallett, 71, who campaigned for president in 1972 toting ``the
weight of the world'' in a weighted sack over his shoulder, said
he's running again ``to save the country. God told me we're gonna
lose it.''
   Mallett believes that for America and the world to be saved, we
must have two presidents.
   ``If we have a president from Mars, still we must have two.
That's my motto,'' he said.
   Just outside the convention zone stood another minister, street
preacher Dan Martino of Chattanooga, Tenn. Martino stood for hours
in the hot sun at a corner near the convention center, wearing a
grey suit and black wing tips and holding the sign that got him a
lot of attention: ``GOD IS A REPUBLICAN!''
   ``I'm here trying to help the Democrats to think,'' he said.
   Religion, however, took a beating from former Connecticut state
legislator Thomas Supina Jr. of Ashford, Conn., who stood on the
sidewalk in front of the Omni Hotel, next door to the arena,
distributing copies of a letter he has sent to U.S. Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop.
   Supina, 82, is asking Koop to declare that ``religion is an
addictive drug'' and that living according to the preachings of
most ministries ``could be dangerous to your health.''
   In his letter, Supina says TV preachers Jimmy Swaggart, Jim
Bakker, Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are
``disturbing the peace, the tranquility and the well being of
people everywhere.''
   Later, back inside the demonstration area, poet Deacon Lunchbox
of Atlanta, a big man with a long red beard and a small red cap,
took the stage with several ``left-wing poems of the day.''
   ``Terrorism,'' one was called. It's about Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi:
   ``He likes to pray in the desert in his wrap-around shades,
   ``When he ain't causing trouble, he likes to have parades.''
   But neither the Guy With A Box On His Head, Pastor Mallett,
preacher Martino, the former Connecticut legislator or the deacon
of left-wing poetry attracted the media attention enjoyed by
Franklin Burke of Los Angeles, who has apparently become the
Official Character of the 1988 Democratic Convention.
   Looking just a bit like a wayward Uncle Sam, wearing
red-and-black checked slacks, a U.S. flag vest, a Dukakis sign and
a Dukakis hat, Burke has stood in the demonstration area each day
since Sunday. He waves a U.S. flag with a blue plastic bird tacked
to the top _ and its wings, if he jumps around enough, really move.
   ``Bird!'' he cries, jumping up and down to make the wings work.
``There it goes! Up in the air!''
   ``I'm here to have a good time, meet the delegates, see all the
people, join in the celebration,'' he said.
   He was certainly meeting a lot of journalists. How many of the
13,000 covering the convention had he talked with by Tuesday?
   ``About 12,000,'' he said.

   Leaders of the Medellin drug cartel in 1986
offered U.S. officials a deal under which they would halt drug
trafficking and provide information on leftist guerrillas in
Colombia in exchange for amnesty from prosecution, according to a
published report today.
   The proposal in the fall of 1986 never was taken seriously or
pursued by the Reagan administration, The Washington Post reported,
citing laws enforcement sources and documents.
   The newspaper said the deal was presented to an unidentified
Miami lawyer, reported to the FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration in Miami and then relayed to senior administration
officials in Washington.
   ``We don't do business with international outlaws,'' said Ann B.
Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics, who acknowledged that she was familiar with the offer.
``These people are the scum of the earth.''
   Under the proposed deal, top leaders of the Medellin cartel
offered to ``work for American intelligence'' and inform on
guerrilla allies by supplying information on alleged Libyan arms
shipments and Cuban personnel operating in Colombia, the newspaper
said, citing DEA documents reports and sources.
   The documents were obtained recently by a Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee, which has been holding hearings on
international narcotics trafficking.
   The DEA documents said the Miami lawyer attended two meetings in
Colombia with cartel leaders Jorge Ochoa, Pablo Escobar and Carlos
Lehder, who has been convicted on drug charges in Jacksonville, Fla.
   ``Lehder appeared to be under the impression that he, Escobar
and Ochoa can work for American intelligence by supplying
information about guerrilla activities, thereby incurring amnesty
for their efforts,'' the DEA account said. ``They then can return
to their families and call an end to their trafficking activities.''
   Lehder was captured three months after the meeting with the
lawyer in a jungle shoot-out.

<HEAD>Police Searched Five Days For 6-Year-Old Summer Camp Stowaway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six-year-old J.B. McNickles had never been to
camp before, so when the bus showed up he decided to take advantage
of the opportunity.
   The bus drove off to Malibu and dropped J.B. at a Salvation Army
summer camp, where he was assigned to a bunk and spent five days
hiking, swimming and sitting 'round the campfire.
   What he didn't do was tell his foster parents where he was going.
   They spent five frantic days as police distributed pictures of
their missing child and organized door-to-door searches, until J.B.
reappeared on the doorstep Monday.
   ``When I came back, my mommy almost had a heart attack,'' J.B.
reported Tuesday. ``Almost all the people in the city were looking
for me. They was glad that I came home.''
   ``We thought something had happened,'' said his foster mother,
63-year-old Edna Williams. ``I thought he might have gotten picked
up or he might have hurt himself somewhere.''
   ``How much they spent looking for me?'' asked J.B. ``A hundred
thousand dollars, maybe?''
   Police Detective Nancy Lyon, who investigated the disappearance,
didn't sound so amused. ``These various agencies need to be alerted
that their checks and balances didn't work and they got outsmarted
by a 6-year-old,'' she said.
   So how did said 6-year-old slip into camp and spend five days
there unnoticed?
   Simple, said J.B.
   Odell Williams, his foster father, dropped him off at the Boys
and Girls Club of San Fernando Valley, where he was supposed to be
spending a few hours at an athletic program. J.B. noticed some kids
getting into a van.
   ``I never had been to camp before,'' J.B. explained. ``I wanted
to see what it was like.''
   J.B. said he just got in and went to the back of the bus.
   Maj. Joe Noland of the Salvation Army said J.B. had a bag of
clothes with him and apparently stood in for a child who was signed
up but didn't show.
   When the bus returned, someone recognized J.B. and brought him
home. J.B. was unimpressed by his adventure.
   The Malibu scenery, he said, ``was junky. Just some mountains.''
   And camp food?
   ``I hated it. I didn't eat any of it. I didn't even touch it,''
he said.

   North Korea has accepted a letter from
South Korea's National Assembly urging it to take part in the
Olympic Games in Seoul, officials said today.
   The letter from Assembly Speaker Kim Chae-sun to his North
Korean counterpart, Yang Hyong Sop, was handed to North Korean
representatives at the Panmunjom truce site on Monday.
   It was the first time the communist North has accepted a letter
from the South via Panmunjom since Oct. 16. The North refused to
accept several South Korean government proposals on easing tension
during the past few weeks.
   Unification Board officials said they did not know why the North
picked up the letter this time. But the assembly is controlled by
the South Korean opposition, and the North might be more willing to
deal with the assembly than the administration.
   Pyongyang has threatened to boycott the Sept. 17-Oct.2 games
unless it is allowed to be a co-host. Olympic authorities have
rejected the North's demand.
   The North accuses the government of President Roh Tae-woo of
being dictatorial and has called on opposition forces, students and
workers in the South to oust the government to speed up
reunfication of the two Koreas.
   The peninsula has been divided into the pro-Western South and
the communist North since 1945.

<TEXT>
   Six former narcotics officers extorted at
least $400,000 plus cocaine from drug dealers, prosecutors charged
in another indictment in a 10-year-old federal probe of
Philadelphia corruption.
   Police Commissioner Willie Williams called the indictments
announced Tuesday at a news conference ``another sad day'' for the
Police Department.
   Since 1976, some 40 Philadelphia police officers have been
convicted, mostly for protecting illegal gambling.
   In addition, four judges have been found guilty of extortion,
convicted of taking cash from a Roofers Union local whose 13 top
officials dispensed bribes to them and at least 10 other jurists,
also removed from the bench.
   FBI agents Tuesday said six narcotics officers were part of a
racketeering conspiracy that involved extortion of money and drugs.
A seventh narcotics officer and two civilians were charged with
lesser drug and tax violations.
   Some of the officers were accused of dealing cocaine and
methamphetamine seized from drug suspects.
   ``For a police officer to use his or her position to steal money
is bad enough, but for police officers to take money or other
property in exchange for allowing drug dealers to continue to deal
drugs or for the officers to take and to distribute drugs
themselves, that makes other forms of official corruption pale in
comparison,'' said acting U.S. Attorney Thomas Lee II.
   Six of the officers named are no longer members of
Philadelphia's 7,000-member department. Williams said the seventh
officer was suspended and will be dismissed.
   One indicted officer, former Lt. John Wilson, appeared suddenly
at the news conference to protest his innocence before the TV
cameras. He was roughly evicted.
   Outside, Wilson and former squad member James Cattalo, also
indicted, criticized the charges. ``They are false, they are
exaggerated,'' Cattalo said. ``No money was stolen. No drugs were
stolen. Everything was done properly.''
   The indictment alleges the scheme occurred from 1980 to 1984 and
involved members of the department's elite Five Squad. The squad
has been disbanded.

   Lion Serpent Sun was indeed a
satanist but was not involved in any human sacrifice attempt, a
jury decided in awarding him $10,000 in a libel suit.
   The British Columbia Supreme Court jury ruled Tuesday that Sun
was libeled when Len Olsen, in a 1984 appearance on the
Toronto-based TV show ``100 Huntley Street,'' claimed he and his
wife barely escaped death in a satanic ritual.
   Sun, a 39-year-old welfare recipient with self-proclaimed status
as bishop in the ``Holy Catholic Gnostic Ekklesia,'' was awarded
$10,000 Canadian ($8,300 U.S.) in damages and court costs from
Olsen, the TV show and an evangelist who appeared with Olsen.
   ``I do feel that the award should have been a little bit
higher,'' said Sun, who was wearing a brown cleric's collar.
   ``I do resent being called a satanist in the sense that it's
been explained in so many ways as being such a negative thing,'' he
said. ``I don't like being called a satanist. I find that
difficult.''
   Olsen, now a Pentecostal preacher who runs a Vancouver clinic
for troubled teen-agers, said he and his wife were considering an
appeal.
   ``We feel somewhat vindicated in that it was said by the jury
that the group was satanist,'' said Olsen, flanked by his wife,
Sheila.
   Geoff Cowper, counsel for ``100 Huntley Street,'' said he would
make his recommendation on an appeal within a few weeks.
   During six weeks of testimony, the jury heard one lurid tale
after another of nude ritual meetings, drugs, satanic practices and
witchcraft in Sun's now-defunct Diddling Metaphysical Bookstore.
   What the jury had to decide was what happened the night of Oct.
14, 1972.
   Witnesses for Sun said the only thing out of the ordinary was
Olsen's behavior following the consecration of some ceremonial
knives.
   One of the ``high priests,'' Gary Gage-Cole, testifed that
Olsen's chanting suddenly went off key. Olsen became ``wild-eyed''
and starting screaming that the others were going to kill him,
Gage-Cole said.
   Gage-Cole said Sun tried to calm Olsen by putting his arm around
him and then bringing a statue of Christ decorated with angels and
demons into the ritual circle.
   The Olsens testified that as the ritual was drawing to a close,
Sun, Gage-Cole and two others drew their ceremonial knives and held
them to the couple's throats.
   Olsen said he saw the statue and heard the voice of God telling
him to break the circle. When he did that, Olsen said, the sound of
a flute came out of his mouth. Olsen and his wife then fled.
   ``There has to be an easier way to become a Christian than
that,'' Olsen said.

   A federal bankruptcy judge has ruled that
PTL should be repaid nearly $200,000 of the $363,700 it spent to
buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with Jim
Bakker led to his downfall.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds said PTL is owed $160,000
in principal and interest from a $150,000 trust fund the
evangelical empire set up for the former church secretary in 1985
in return for her promise not to talk about the liaison.
   Los Angeles lawyer Scott Furstman already has agreed to return
$39,000 of a $50,000 retainer PTL paid him to administer the trust
fund.
   Reynolds entered the judgment on Tuesday against Ms. Hahn and
Furstman.
   Reynolds' ruling came the same day that PTL bankruptcy trustee
M.C. ``Red'' Benton said contributions have declined drastically.
   In the past four weeks, PTL has received an average of $32,000 a
day in donations, or 47 percent of contributions for the same
period a year ago, Benton said.
   In an effort to keep PTL's religious broadcasting going until
the Heritage USA Christian theme park is sold, a new entity called
Heritage Ministries will begin July 29. It will pay PTL $242,000 a
month for broadcast time on the PTL satellite network and for rent
on PTL's studios and church buildings.
   PTL sued Ms. Hahn and Furstman for the hush money in April,
claiming Ms. Hahn broke her agreement with PTL by talking about her
1980 encounter with Bakker at a hotel in Clearwater Beach, Fla.
   Ms. Hahn last year sold her story _ illustrated with semi-nude
photos of herself _ to Playboy for a reported $1 million.
   Ms. Hahn, who recently moved out of the Playboy Mansion in Los
Angeles and lives in a hotel there, never replied to the suit. She
and Paul Roper, her representative in the 1985 transaction, have
said they did not realize the money was PTL's, rather than Bakker's
personal money, and that they felt guilty about taking it.
   Furstman was hired by PTL in 1985 to help in dealings with Ms.
Hahn.
   The Hahn transaction, as well as other of Bakker's financial
dealings at PTL, are the subject of a federal grand jury
investigation into possible tax fraud.
   An IRS report filed in bankruptcy court in December said PTL's
payments in the Hahn incident included the $150,000 trust fund; a
$115,000 payment to Roper, who gave $20,000 to Ms. Hahn; $85,000 in
legal fees to Furstman, and $10,000 paid to Ms. Hahn in 1984 for
her signature on a statement absolving Bakker of wrongdoing.
   Ms. Hahn received monthly interest from the trust fund from 1985
until PTL stopped the payments in 1987. Her tax returns indicate
she received $10,000 in 1985. Under the judge's orders, she does
not have to repay that money.

   Iran said it would respect an immediate
truce in the eight-year Persian Gulf war, but Iraq accused Tehran
of a ``two-faced'' ploy to win time for surprise attacks and said
it would fight on.
   Even so, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar was making
progress in talks with Iran and Iraq's U.N. envoys in his quest to
negotiate a cease-fire in a week to 10 days, Britain's U.N.
ambassador, Sir Crispen Tickell, said Tuesday. He did not elaborate.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said today that accepting the
resolution was ``worse than drinking poison,'' but that Iran's
political leaders recommended it be done.
   He said the decision was not a tactic to allow Iran to regroup
its forces, but it should not be viewed as an end to the conflict,
either.
   On Tuesday night, the Security Council called upon Iran and Iraq
``to exercise maximum restraint in order to facilitate the efforts
of the secretary-general toward the implementation of Resolution
598.''
   The council members issued the call after holding private
consultations on the cease-fire plan and on America's downing of an
Iranian jetliner on July 3, killing 290 civilians aboard.
   Khomeini said he could not immediately answer those asking him
why he changed his mind after saying for years that Iran would
fight ``until the last drop of blood.'' His remarks were carried by
Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   Iran on Monday declared after a year's delay that it
unconditionally accepts the Security Council resolution, which
demands an immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a
peace plan to end the war.
   Iraq said last year it would accept the resolution, but on
Tuesday it raided a nuclear power plant and other Iranian
industrial targets. Iran accused the Baghdad government of
sabotaging peace efforts.
   Perez de Cuellar's spokesman, Francois Giuliani, said the
secretary-general believes ``the continuation of hostilities is a
clear sign that the cease-fire must come into place as soon as
possible.''
   The Peruvian met separately Tuesday with Iraq's ambassador,
Ismat T. Kittani, and Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati.
   In a letter, Mahallati urged the Security Council to condemn
Tuesday's Iraqi attacks, saying the action ``defiantly mocks all
efforts for attainment of a peaceful end to the conflict.''
   He said he told the U.N. chief ``that in the view of the
authorities of Iran, the secretary-general ... has a totally free
hand to declare D-Day at this very moment, which means starting
implementation of Resolution 598.''
   D-Day is the day on which a cease-fire would begin. It would be
set by the secretary-general after consultations with both sides.
   But Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq, speaking in Baghdad,
called Iran's decision to accept the resolution ``two-faced'' and
``aimed at winning time to launch surprise offensives'' in the war.
   ``We will consider the war to be still going on until the actual
application of the cease-fire according to an agreed-upon plan,''
he said. ``We have to make sure the Iranians really want a
comprehensive and lasting peace.''
   He said that until Iran takes tangible steps toward peace and
demonstrates its sincerity, ``it is logical to act as if the war is
still going on.''
   A senior Middle East diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said: ``Iraq is not interested in a simple cease-fire.
Iraq is interested in a comprehensive settlement and Iran must
specifically state and prove its willingness for more than a
truce.''
   Since April, Iraq has scored a series of battlefield victories
that have regained just about all the territory Iran captured from
it since 1982.

<TEXT>
   The government said today it has
identified the ringleader of a massacre aboard a Greek cruise ship,
and it linked him to a slaying claimed by the Abu Nidal terrorist
group.
   Public Order Minister Anastasios Sehiotis said the leader was
Hejab Jaballa, who holds a Libyan passport. Sehiotis said Jaballa
was involved in the slaying of an Egyptian newspaper editor 10
years ago in Nicosia, Cyprus, which was claimed by Abu Nidal.
   He said three accomplices to the ship attack also were
identified. Sehiotis identified them as Aboul Amoud, Adnan Sojod
and Merhi Mehieddine.
   Terrorists fired guns and threw grenades aboard the ship, the
City of Poros, in the Aegean Sea on July 11. Nine people were
killed and at least 98 were wounded.
   Police matched fingerprints found in an Athens apartment rented
by Jaballa with those uncovered in 1978 in Cyprus and found they
belonged to the same person, Sehiotis said.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, gets much of his
funding from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and maintains
headquarters in Tripoli. U.S. officials have said Abu Nidal
probably conducted the ship attack.
   Sehiotis, who read a long statement to journalists, refused to
say whether Jaballa and his alleged accomplices were dead or had
fled the country.
   Sehiotis said police speculated that at least one of the gunmen
may have been killed by an explosion that rocked the ship's bridge.
No positive identification of two bodies has been made.
   Hours before the attack, two men believed to be Arabs died in a
car explosion near a marina where the City of Poros was scheduled
to dock. Their car contained automatic weapons and explosives.
   Officials released photographs of three Arab suspects. They said
the photographs were found in forged passports and at the site of
the explosion of the car. The officials identified only two of the
men in the photographs _ Jaballa and Mehieddine _ but were unable
to name the third man.
   Police said they believe the occupants of the car were waiting
for the cruise liner to arrive at the marina and planned to hijack
it.
   Sehiotis said Jaballa arrived in Greece by air from Copenhagen
on June 1. He was preceded by his three accomplices, who arrived in
Athens early in May from Belgrade after starting out from Beirut,
Sehiotis said.
   ``All the evidence indicates that Jaballa played the leading
role in the terrorist operation since he had all the details of
members of his group in his possession,'' Sehiotis said.
   Police said that during their investigation, they found forged
passports belonging to the suspects.
   Greek officials were reluctant to say whatArab group could
possibly be behind the massacre aboard the ship. But CIA director
William Webster in Washington reportedly said last week that the
terrorist attack appeared to be the work of the Abu Nidal group.
   Merchant Marine Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos outlined new
security measures in effect at the country's major ports and aboard
cruise liners.
   He said that five to 10 commandos would be assigned to each
cruise ship and would be responsible for neutralizing terrorist
attempts to take over a vessel.
   Passengers at the port of Piraeus near Athens reported they
underwent a body search and their luggage was photographed by X-ray
equipment before boarding a ship for a cruise last weekend.

   The new president of the Teamsters disputed the
Justice Department's contention that the union leadership is
controlled by the Mafia and said he himself is clean.
   ``I can tell you, I hope to get cancer of the tongue, I don't
know any of these guys,'' said William J. McCarthy of the reputed
organized crime figures named in the government's lawsuit to take
control of the 1.6 million-member union.
   McCarthy's remarks appeared in today's Boston Globe in the first
interview he has given since he upset Weldon Mathis last week to
succeed Jackie Presser as president of the nation's biggest union.
   Mathis is the union's secretary-treasurer and was Presser's
hand-picked successor. McCarthy, 69, said he challenged Mathis
because of growing disagreements over contract talks, political
endorsements and other issues.
   ``Things have got to be changed around completely,'' said
McCarthy, who had been head of the Teamsters in New England.
   McCarthy told the Globe that he had disagreed with Mathis and
Presser, who died July 9, over a new contract affecting 200,000
drivers nationwide.
   The contract, which calls for pay increases of 2.2 percent per
year for the next three years, was rejected by 64 percent of union
members but still went into effect because of a provision requiring
a two-thirds no vote to kill a contract.
   McCarthy said he had objected to the two-thirds rule and had
argued with Presser about it.
   He also said he had disagreed with Presser's plans to have the
union endorse Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for president immediately
after the Democratic National Convention.
   Mathis said he would prefer to poll the membership and
``whatever the majority says, that's the route we'll go.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growth in personal income slowed in most
states during the first three months of 1988, with the timing of
farm subsidy payments depressing income in the corn-growing states
of Nebraska and Iowa and boosting income in the wheat-growing
states of Montana, North Dakota and Oklahoma, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said growth in the 50 states slowed to
0.8 percent in the January-March period, compared with growth of
2.8 percent in the final quarter of 1987. Income dropped in six
states, edged up in 42 and showed no growth in two.
   In all but three states _ Oklahoma, Idaho and Montana _ income
either fell or its growth slowed from the fourth quarter.
   Residents of Montana saw their incomes shoot up by 6 percent
over the last three months of 1987, the biggest increase of any
state. Income in North Dakota jumped 4.1 percent while income in
Oklahoma rose 2.4 percent.
   All three increases were attributed to advance subsidy payments
on the 1988 wheat and barley crops.
   Nebraska had the biggest decline, 6.0 percent, followed by Iowa,
4.2 percent, and South Dakota, 2.6 percent. Incomes fell there in
the January-March period following large fourth-quarter corn
subsidy payments.
   Other states suffering declines or no growth were Minnesota,
down 0.8 percent; Colorado, down 0.4 percent, and Texas and Utah,
both with no change.
   The report noted that the effects of subsidy payments can vary
substantially from state to state and quarter to quarter because
the assistance is not paid out evenly over the year and each
eligible crop is under a different subsidy program.
   Excluding farm income, Nevada showed the strongest growth, 2
percent, followed by Vermont and Virginia, 1.7 percent each.
   Alaska, the only state where incomes declined, slipped 1.0
percent, excluding farm income. Oklahoma showed no growth, while
Texas and Colorado edged up only 0.1 percent. Weak oil prices were
blamed for the poor performance of incomes in those states, which
are heavily dependent on oil drilling and mining.
   Overall, personal income excluding farm payments rose 1.0
percent in the 50 states.
   The report also noted profit sharing and bonus payments by auto
companies boosted income in Michigan, which had a 0.9 percent rise,
and Ohio, where income advanced 1.0 percent.

   Britain today celebrated the 300th anniversary of
the bloodless Glorious Revolution that established its democracy
and brought to the throne William and Mary, who founded the royally
chartered American college.
   About 1,500 people filled the Palace of Westminster, seat of the
British Parliament, for a ceremony celebrating the world's most
enduring constitutional monarchy.
   Among the guests were a U.S. delegation from the College of
William and Mary in Virginia, led by former Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger.
   They were joined by Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Prince William of Orange, heir to the Dutch throne, a
Dutch parliamentary delegation and speakers of many of the
parliaments of Commonwealth countries.
   The ceremony recalled the 17th century abdication of King James
II, the last of England's absolute monarchs, and the arrival from
the Netherlands of William and Mary, who were enthroned as
constitutional monarchs ruling under Parliament.
   William, invited by dissident noblemen to replace James, sailed
to England with 300 ships and 15,000 soldiers.
   The Glorious Revolution and the Bill of Rights that followed in
1689 ``transformed the relationship between the crown and
Parliament. They secured our liberties,'' said Bernard Weatherill,
speaker of the House of Commons, in his address.
   Queen Elizabeth, in her address, said William's accession to the
throne with Mary ``ended almost a century of constitutional turmoil
and uncertainty in the two kingdoms'' of England and Scotland.
   It meant, the queen said, that ``the successive swings between
the arbitrary rule of the king and arbitrary rule of parliament
became intolerable.''
   Some historians argue that the Glorious Revolution entrenched
the rule of the British upper classes and led to the repression of
Catholics under Protestant William's reign.
   Paul R. Verkuil, president of the College of William and Mary,
said in an interview that the controversy ``has not been exported''
to the United States.
   ``For us, the Glorious Revolution is pure and simple, the
precursor of our own revolution. It is truly an important event for
us,'' he said.
   The college, whose chancellor is Burger, was founded in 1693 at
the behest of William and Mary. Congress, with President Reagan's
assent, designated it to represent the United States at today's
ceremony.

   John W. Galbreath, a former owner of
baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates and a breeder of two Kentucky Derby
winners, died today at 90.
   Galbreath, one of the nation's wealthiest men with real estate
and sports holdings, pioneered ``package deals,'' in which he took
care of everything for a corporation that wanted a new building.
   Forbes magazine in 1986 estimated the fortune of Galbreath and
his son, Dan, at $400 million.
   Galbreath, a former chairman of the board of Churchill Downs in
Lousiville, Ky., got into racing in the 1930s, when he bought five
thoroughbred mares to breed polo ponies.
   He said in a 1981 interview that he became convinced the horses
were too good not to race, ``and once you win, you're hooked.''
   Twice, his horses won the Kentucky Derby: Chateaugay in 1963 and
Proud Clarion in 1967. Galbreath's horse Little Current won the
Preakness and the Belmont Stakes in 1974.
   Galbreath, along with three partners including singer Bing
Crosby, purchased the Pirates in 1946. Galbreath was named
president of the team in 1950. In 1969 he was succeeded by his son,
Dan.
   The Galbreaths sold their interests in the club in 1985.
   Under Galbreath's ownership, the Pirates won the World Series in
1960 _ on Bill Mazeroski's dramatic seventh-game, ninth-inning home
run _ in 1971 and again in 1979.
   In the 1970s, the Pirates also won six division championships
and two National League pennants.
   Galbreath was born in Derby, south of Columbus, and graduated
from Ohio University.
   Galbreath began his business career in 1920, joining a
fraternity brother in the real estate business. He began his own
business a few years later.
   Although he said he suffered losses during the stock market
crash of 1929, Galbreath began buying properties at low prices
during the 1930s, consolidating them and selling them in package
form to those in search of investments.
   Major projects included the town of Kearny, Ariz., to serve a
mining installation by Kennecott Copper Corp., and a 2,000-home
project in Fairless Hills, Pa., to serve the Fairless Works of the
former U.S. Steel Corp.
   He acquired such buildings as the Socony-Mobil Building in New
York City, a 39-story office building in Pittsburgh whose private
tenant was Mellon Bank, and the 40-story Union Bank Square in Los
Angeles.
   Galbreath was twice widowed. Survivors in addition to his son
include a daughter and seven grandchildren.
   A memorial service was set for Saturday in Marble Cliff, with
the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale officiating.

   The pastor of a church where a
4-year-old girl may have been held for up to six weeks says no one
would have heard her if she yelled for help because she was kept in
a space far beneath the altar.
   A deaf-mute church janitor, Kenneth Alvin Michel, was scheduled
for arraignment late today on kidnapping charges in the case.
   Michel, 32, was arrested Monday as he drove up to the United
Methodist Church in suburban Elk Grove where officers found two
missing girls.
   Five-year-old Muey Han Saefong, who was kidnapped Monday in
Sacramento, was found in the back of Michel's car, her mouth taped
and legs bound, police said.
   The 4-year-old, Candi Talarico, who had been missing since June
4, was found in an L-shaped space under the church.
   The hiding space, officers said, had a dirt floor, concrete
walls and a wooden ceiling. It was furnished with blankets, stuffed
animals, books, food, lights, a television and newspapers that
contained articles about the Talarico kidnapping, which was
featured on Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most Wanted'' TV
program.
   Boards covered the entrance to the space, which church pastor
Linda Inlow said was below a wooden crawl space under the church.
   Inlow said the discovery shocked church officials.
   ``We don't know how long she was down there, or if she was down
there the whole time,'' Inlow said Tuesday. ``We don't know if she
was tied up or able to communicate. (But) the crawl space is well
insulated and you wouldn't have necessarily been able to hear
anyone.''
   She said that Candi was kept in a 7-by-9-by-3 foot space under
the crawl space floor.
   Investigators found Michel after a witness gave them the license
number of a car allegedly used in an attempted abduction Monday of
a 6-year-old girl; the girl's 9-year-old sister and the witness
foiled the abduction, said police Sgt. Bob Burns.
   Inlow said Michel had been placed on leave of absence by a day
care center where he also worked because of ``potential problems
with his behavior.''
   Inlow said Michel ``was never accused of molestation or
fondling.''
   The Rev. David Delaplane, an adviser to Inlow, said the center
placed Michel on leave of absence last spring because Michel
pinched some children who had teased him because of his handicaps.

   Three men parachuted off the roof of a
40-story building early today, polie said.
   The men were later traced by police to a hospital where one had
sought treatment for back injuries, and their parachutes were
confiscated, police said.
   No arrests were made. Lt. Gene LaBriola said the city attorney's
office will decide whether to file charges.
   Police said the jump took place about 1:30 a.m. from a building
on Wilshire Boulevard.
   ``It appears they did it for sport,'' said LaBriola.
   A security guard told authorities one of the three was injured
when he landed on a sidewalk. Officers went to the nearest medical
facility, the Hospital of the Good Samaritan, and found three men
with parachutes, LaBriola said.
   The men's identities were not immediately available, nor was the
extent of the one man's injuries, police said.
   ``It's a mystery how they got on the roof,'' LaBriola said.

   Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk, facing
complaints from delegates who couldn't get in to see Jesse Jackson,
said today that they knew the size of the hall and that they should
stay in the building during convention sessions to keep the same
thing from happening again.
   ``This is not a superdome,'' Kir said. ``For all intents and
purposes, it's a live TV studio.''
   Kirk's comments came after as many as 1,000 unhappy people, some
of them delegates, were left outside the Omni Tuesday night because
party leaders had the building's entrances sealed off before
Jackson's late speech at the fire marshal's suggestion.
   To avoid a repeat situation, Kirk suggested delegates remain in
the building after the gavel sounds to open the convention each day.
   On Tuesday, police gazed across their barricades at a shouting
throng of credential-waving delegates, guests and reporters who
were left standing in the warm night breeze.
   Jackson's speech could be seen on large televisions set up in a
cavernous exhibition hall across the street, but those who were
stuck outside didn't pay their way to Atlanta to watch TV.
   ``I would rather die,'' said Richard Koster, who traveled from
Panama as part of the Democrats Abroad delegation. ``Why don't you
watch your wedding night on TV?''
   ``It was not unexpected that we would have problems with the
hall,'' said party spokesman Mike McCurry.
   The same thing happened at least three times in 1984, when
Democrats held their convention in the 15,000-seat Moscone Center
Hall in San Francisco, McCurry said.
   So why did the party four years later decide to meet in a hall
that could seat only 11,000?
   ``I'm just not going to go into that right now,'' he said.
``That's ancient history and we're here now.''
   Kirk said the building wasn't too small, the crowd was just too
big. ``People should have known,'' Kirk said. ``Obviously people
had plenty of notice. It has nothing to do with the size of the
hall.''
   The great and the small alike found themselves unable to budge
the police.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., was seen emerging from a crowd that was
trying without success to gain entry. When asked his thoughts about
being barred from a building in his home state, Nunn's reply was a
stare followed by a no comment.
   Aides said later that Nunn wasn't really trying to get back in
the hall but was leaving so he could watch Jackson on television.
   A handful of relatives of Michael Dukakis, the party's
nominee-to-be, were detained for a few minutes by a skeptical
policeman. They eventually were allowed to pass.
   Delegates ran from one gate to the next in hopes that someone
somewhere would let them in. About three dozen of them eventually
made it.
   The rest elbowed their way through crowds yelling ``delegate,
delegate.'' There were shouts of ``Let me in'' and ``This is
America, buddy.''
   Rep. Carol Moseley Braun, assistant majority leader of the
Illinois General Assembly, said she was turned away from The Omni
and watched Jackson's speech on television in the adjoining World
Congress Center.
   ``I was furious about not getting in, particularly as a delegate
from the state of Illinois,'' she said. ``I though it was a denial
of my right to participate in the process.''
   Delegates did not miss any key votes, but Koster said they were
denied the possibility to witness history.
   He drew a connection to the convention in 1896 when a relatively
unknown politician, William Jennings Bryan, delivered his famous
``cross of gold'' speech that propelled him instantly from
obscurity to the Democratic presidential nomination.

   An investigator testified today
that Mohammed Ali Hamadi, charged in the hijacking of a TWA jet,
admitted belong to a pro-Iranian group linked to the holding of
Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The testimony of Heinrich Brandtjen, a federal police
investigator from West Germany, contradicted Hamadi's statements
last week that he was not a member of the radical Hezbollah group.
   Brandtjen's testimony came after Hamadi, charged with murder and
air piracy in the hijacking that left an American Navy diver dead,
declared that he hates the United States.
   A prosecution witness who said she met Hamadi in West Germany
the month before the June 1985 hijacking broke into tears and said
someone threatened her to keep her from saying she recognized the
defendant.
   After his older brother, Abbas, refused to testify at the start
of today's proceedings, Hamadi read from a statement he started
Tuesday.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger interrupted him, asking: ``Do
you hate the U.S.A.?''
   ``I grew up in Lebanon in the middle of the war, and one
naturally asks himself _ why? The answer was always America, or
Israel with support of America,'' the Shiite Moslem responded.
   Again the chief judge asked him: ``Do you hate America?''
   ``I have hateful feelings for all that attacked us, not just for
the U.S.A. alone,'' Hamadi said through an interpreter.
   ``I only hear America, America, America. America kills, America
destroys,'' he said.
   The chief judge asked him: ``Do you find attacks and hijackings
against the U.S.A. justified?''
   ``I'm not convinced that all forms of fighting are correct.'' He
cited an admonition in the Koran, Islam's holy book, to ``fight
those who fight you, but don't attack those that don't attack you.''
   The jetliner was hijacked to Beirut on a flight from Athens to
Rome in June 1985. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17
days, and U.S. Navy diver Robert Stetham was killed.
   Brandtjen said that Hamadi admitted joining the radical
Hezbollah group after the TWA incident. One of Hamadi's brothers,
Abdul-Hadi, is Hezbollah's security chief in Beirut.
   ``He told me he has belonged to Hezbollah since the autumn of
1985 or 1986, but I cannot remember exactly the year,'' Brandtjen
said.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for pro-Iranian
groups holding 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, hostage in
Lebanon.
   Earlier, one of the judges asked witness Helga Marx if she
recognized Mohammed, and she said she was unsure.
   Her testimony came as the court tried to establish Hamadi's
movements and actions before the hijacking. Hamadi has given only
vague accounts of where he was.
   Before the trial, Mrs. Marx told police she met Hamadi and his
brother Abbas in the town of Merzig, at a party in an apartment
building where she lived. Abbas Hamadi was living in the same
building.
   The judge reminded her of what she had told police and asked:
``Would you answer this question differently if you had not been
threatened?''
   She replied: ``Of course, I would answer differently.''
   Asked whether the threat was written or verbal, Mrs. Marx
replied: ``I have four children. They said it would be better and
healthier for me if I don't say anything.''
   There was no explanation of who made the threat.
   Mohammed Hamadi then stood up and said: ``Could the person you
saw have been taller, stronger built and with different hair?''
   Mrs. Marx replied: ``No. The person looked exactly like you.''
   The chief judge asked Abbas Hamadi whether he would testify
about his brother's age, a key issue in the trial, or about
explosives Mohammed Hamadi is charged with trying to smuggle into
West Germany.
   His age determines whether he would be sentenced as a juvenile,
young adult or adult.
   Abbas Hamadi refused both requests.
   Mohammed Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport on Jan. 13,
1987, trying to smuggle three bottles of liquid explosives into the
country.
   He has told the court that Abbas Hamadi managed to get through
customs undetected, although he also was carrying liquid
explosives. The brothers arrived in Frankfurt together from Beirut,
Lebanon.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was arrested Jan. 26, 1987, at Frankfurt
Airport when he returned after the kidnappings of West Germans
Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt in Beirut. Schmidt was freed in
September, but Cordes remains a hostage.
   He was convicted of masterminding the kidnappings in a bid to
force his brother's release. A Duesseldorf court sentenced him to
13 years in prison in April.

   A federal judge today denied a
newspaper's request that he unseal the affidavits that led to
search warrants as part of the ongoing Pentagon bribery
investigation.
   ``It seems to me that release of this information now would harm
the process'' of the investigation, said U.S. District Court Judge
Claude A. Hilton as he explained his ruling.
   Hilton rejected a motion by The Washington Times that he should
make public the affidavits that led to some of the search warrants
that were served June 14.
   The warrants were the public unveiling of the two-year-old
investigation, which centers on allegations that some defense
contractors and private consultants paid bribes to Defense
Department employees for details about contracts. The information
could be vital to winning multi-million dollar contracts.
   Jerome Barron, representing the newspaper, argued that ``the
massive publicity already sought by the government in the middle of
June has put all defense contractors under a cloud.'' The best way
to clear the air is reveal what information the government has, he
said.'
   Barron also argued that release of information could permit
``corrective action to be undertaken'' and he cited the July 1
order of Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, who froze contracts in
nine military programs.
   Carlucci said he was acting on the basis of information in
affadavits which had been unsealed the day before in Dallas, but he
later lifted the suspension because he said a review of the
contracts had shown that none were tainted.
   Barron argued that there is ``tremendous public interest in the
case'' and said the public should know the facts behind the search
warrants.
   But Joseph Aronica, representing the U.S. attorney's office,
opposed the motion and told Hilton, ``to release these papers at
this point would impede this investigation without any doubt.''
   Aronica said the investigation is in its early stages and
release of the affidavits ``may lead to the destruction of
property'' by people who could be targets.
   The government plans to release the affidavits later, Aronica
said, but he said he didn't know when.

<HEAD>Annie Oakley Statue Ready After Three-Year Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Annie Oakley, one of Darke County's most
famous residents, now has a place of honor downtown.
   Workers completed most of the work Tuesday to mount a 6-foot
bronze statue of the lady sharpshooter on a granite pedestal in
Annie Oakley Memorial Park, capping a three-year campaign to honor
her. The statue is to be dedicated Sunday.
   Greenville's Annie Oakley Days festival has been a tradition for
nearly a quarter of a century, but Rodney Oda, chairman of the
memorial committee, said having the statue will give local people
more of a sense of who she was.
   ``When you talk about famous women, she's one of the top two or
three women in the world of that time, and it's amazing what she
accomplished in her era,'' he said.
   Oda said the statue will help portray Oakley ``as a role model
to show people you don't have to come from a good background to
become something.''
   Annie Oakley, also known as Little Miss Sure Shot, was born
Phoebe Ann Moses in Willowdell, Darke County, in 1860. She gained
fame in the 1880s and 1890s as a sharpshooter in Buffalo Bill's
Wild West Show. She died in Darke County in 1926 at age 66.
   Artist Terry Mimnaugh of Lakeside, Mont., an avid competition
shooter herself, used a 17-year-old model for the casting. She said
the sculpture portrays Oakley in her mid-20s.
   ``Even when she was in her 30s, people thought she was a
teen-ager,'' Ms. Mimnaugh said.
   The committee has raised about $102,000 for the project, but Oda
estimated it will take an additional $65,000 to finish landscaping
and installing a brick walk at the small park, slightly less than
an acre.

   The government has agreed to
principles negotiated in New York to remove foreign troops from
Angola and grant independence to South-West Africa, the Department
of Foreign Affairs announced today.
   The governments of Angola, Cuba and the United States were
expected to make similar announcements, agreeing to a list of 14
principles signed by negotiators from the four countries in peace
talks last week.
   The principles include acceptance of a withdrawal of Cuban
troops from Angola and implementation of a U.N. peace plan for
South-West Africa, that includes South African withdrawal from the
territory it rules.
   A call for South African withdrawal of an estimated 3,000 troops
from Angola was not specifically contained in the principles made
public here.
   The agreement reached in New York calls for an estimated 50,000
Cuban troops to leave Marxist-ruled Angola and for South Africa to
end its 73-year rule over South-West Africa, commonly known as
Namibia.
   But no timetable has been set for the withdrawal of Cuban troops
or independence for Namibia, the main issues to be negotiated in
future talks.
   Angola, with help from its Cuban allies, has been fighting a
civil war since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975,
battling the pro-Western rebels of UNITA, or the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
   The United States supplies military aid to UNITA while South
Africa has several thousand troops in southern Angola fighting
alongside the rebels.
   The United States and South Africa are seeking a full Cuban
troop withdrawal over a one-year period. Cuba and Angola have
talked of a four-year period for the Cuban pullback but they have
indicated flexibility.
   Under a 1978 United Nations resolution, independence in Namibia
would be carried out over a one-year time frame once South Africa
consents to that step.
   But South Africa, with U.S. backing, has said the South African
withdrawal will not take place unless Cuba agrees to withdraw its
forces simultaneously.
   Sparsely populated Namibia is between South Africa and Angola.
South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I under a League of
Nations mandate. The League's successor, the United Nations,
revoked that mandate.
   The four parties involved in the talks began their meetings in
London in May. The next round is tentatively scheduled for August.

   State radio reported that 41 people who
were arrested and packed into a prison van on March 18 died during
a two-hour ride to jail.
   Home Minister U Min Goung took responsibility and resigned from
office, according to the announcement on Tuesday.
   It said the government delayed its disclosure to prevent the
possible spread of unrest. The radio said the bodies were cremated
March 19.
   The 41 victims were among 71 people arrested during student
riots and sent in a prison van from downtown Rangoon to Insein
jail, the radio said. It said the detainees were crowded into one
van because of a shortage of such vehicles.
   The ride to the jail, eight miles north of Rangoon, usually
takes 45 minutes but took two hours, the announcement said. It
didn't say why it took so long.
   The 41 were found dead when the van arrived at the jail, with
the deaths due to suffocation caused by exposure to tear gas and to
the long period spent in the overcrowded prison van, the radio said.
   In March, official announcements mentioned two deaths in
connection with the riots.

   The government today expelled a prominent Armenian
activist and stripped him of his Soviet citizenship as punishment
for stirring up nationalist sentiment in an ethnic dispute, the
Tass news agency said.
   Tass did not say where the activist, Paruyr Ayrikyan, 39, was
headed or whether he left the Soviet Union.
   The expulsion came two days after the Soviet leadership gave a
final ruling in the heated and sometimes violent struggle between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis over control of the small
Nagorno-Karabakh region in the Caucasus Mountains.
   The decision by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to reject
Armenia's bid to annex the region appeared today on the front pages
of national newspapers.
   Tass also said that Ayrikyan was pardoned, but it did not say
what he was pardoned for. He was arrested last March on charges of
defaming the Soviet state, but it is not known whether he was
convicted.
   Susana Avakyan, his girlfriend and fellow member of the
underground group Alliance for National Self-Determination, said in
a telephone interview that authorities have been trying for months
to get Ayrikyan to agree to expulsion but that he refused.
   ``He said that if you hear that I agreed, it's a provocation. I
won't agree,'' said Avakyan, 39.
   Ayrikyan relayed the message to two of his sisters who visited
him in prison in late June, Avakyan said.
   On Tuesday night, state-run television showed a debate in the
Presidium during which Mikhail S. Gorbachev chastised nationalists
in Azerbaijan and Armenia for stirring up tensions in the dispute.
   Hundreds of Armenians tried to gather at Red Square on Tuesday
night to protest the decision of the Presidium, the nation's
nominal parliament, to reject the annexation, said an Armenian
activist in Moscow, Leon Sudzhyan. He said police roughed them up
and took them away to police stations.
   Residents of the Armenian capital of Yerevan were said to be
``despondent'' but relatively calm earlier today before Ayrikyan's
expulsion was reported.
   The nationalist helped organize the Armenian drive to have
Nagorno-Karabakh removed from Azerbaijan's control and annexed to
the Armenian republic. He also provided frequent reports to foreign
correspondents in Moscow on the mass demonstrations and strikes
staged in support of the annexation effort.
   ``From youth, he has been involved in fanning up nationalist
animosity,'' Tass said of Ayrikyan, who has spent 17 years in labor
camps and in exile for his activity.
   Tass said the ``former criminal...created a crisis situation in
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh,'' and it accused him of giving
information to Moscow-based correspondents that was ``based on
imagination.'' Ayrikyan was arrested March 25 and charged with
defaming the Soviet state.
   Armenians are predominantly Christian and the Nagorno-Karabakh
region was part of Armenia until 1923. Armenians make up
three-quarters of the 160,000 people of the contested region, and
they claim that Azerbaijanis, who are mostly Moslem, are
discriminating against them.
   Strikes and demonstrations have been common in Nagorno-Karabakh
and the Armenian capital of Yerevan since February, when the
disputed region's initial appeal for transfer to Armenia was
denied. On Feb. 28, rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait left
32 people dead, 26 of them Armenians.
   Repeated telephone calls to Nagorno-Karabakh failed to go
through today.
   The Presidium, heeding Gorbachev's call, said during an
extraordinary eight-hour session on Monday that the constitution
makes the annexation of the region by Armenia ``impossible.''
   During the highlights of the session broacast Tuesday night,
Nagorno-Karabakh leader Genrikh Pogosyan made an impassioned speech
saying the only correct decision was to return the territory to
Armenia.
   But dozens of other speakers contended Azerbaijan was within its
rights in vetoing the annexation bid and called for maintaining the
status quo.
   Gorbachev urged Armenians and Azerbaijanis to accept the
``existing reality'' of the republic's location and struck out at
what he called constant tests of his reforms by groups with selfish
interests at heart.
   Many of the Armenian activists who had been pressing for
annexation have cast the question as a test of the sincerity of
Gorbachev's campaigns to give Soviets more say in governmental
affairs.

<HEAD>US Praises Soviet Offer To Level Disputed Radar Facility</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration today welcomed as a
``positive step'' a Soviet offer to dismantle a disputed radar
complex in Krasnoyarsk, but said there should be no strings
attached to the proposal.
   ``It should be unconditional,'' said a U.S. official, who
described the offer as a step forward in discussions with the
Soviets over the Siberian facility.
   So far, however, the Soviets have not proposed a date for a
joint review with the United States of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, which imposes constraints on radar and other
defenses against rocket attack.
   The offer to dismantle Krasnoyarsk`s phased array radar was
coupled in Moscow on Tuesday with a proposal that the United States
promise to adhere to the pact.
   ``If an understanding to abide by the ABM treaty, as signed in
1972, is reached, the Soviet Union will be ready to dismantle the
Krasnoyarsk redar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on
the part of the United States,'' Viktor P. Karpov, the Soviet
foreign ministry's top arms control specialist, said.
   The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
President Reagan had not decided whether to accuse the Soviets of a
``material breach'' of the treaty at Krasnoyarsk, a step that could
clear the way for the United States to expand its ``Star War''
tests.
   The head of the Arms Control Agency wants Reagan to level the
charge against Moscow while the Joint Chiefs of Staff have urged
him to hold to the 1972 pact.
   The odd lineup reflects a deep and peculiar division within the
administration as Reagan awaits a response from Moscow on when to
review the treaty, considered a cornerstone of the arms control
process.
   Reagan has already labeled the Krasnoyarsk radar a violation of
the 1972 treaty in two reports to Congress. While the Soviets deny
any infraction, even many liberal critics of the administration's
arm control policy question the legality of the facility.
   The joint chiefs recommended that Reagan not charge the Soviets
with a ``material breach'' because that could lead to an unraveling
of the treaty, the U.S. official told The Associated Press. ``The
chiefs are convinced if that happens the Soviets are in a better
position to take advantage of a breakout,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   This puts the chiefs at odds with arms control director William
F. Burns Jr., who takes a harder stance on the treaty than the
military. But Burns would give the Soviets time to level the
facilities before the United States retaliated.
   The official said that even if Reagan accepted the advice of
Burns and other hard-line advisers, it did not mean he would
scuttle the treaty, which limits U.S. and Soviet defenses against
ballistic missiles.
   ``It would mean we have a right to do something restricted by
the treaty,'' the official said. ``It doesn't mean we are going to
throw the treaty out the window.''
   In the meantime, the treaty is due for its five-year review, and
the United States had proposed to the Soviets that the review begin
last Friday in Geneva.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mario Biaggi is ``a thug in a congressman's
suit,'' a prosecutor said in closing arguments today at the
4-month-old Wedtech Corp. corruption trial.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward J. Little told the jury that the
10-term Bronx Democrat had extorted cash and stock from the
now-defunct defense contractor through the power of his office.
   ``He wasn't a thug with a gun. He's a thug in a congressman's
suit,'' Little said.
   Biaggi, 70, his eldest son, Richard, and five others are charged
with turning Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that paid out
millions of dollars in bribes to obtain no-bid defense contracts.
   The defense has maintained that four corrupt Wedtech executives,
who testified for the government in exchange for leniency, had
links to White House insiders like Attorney General Edwin Meese III
and did not need help.
   U.S. District Judge Constance Baker Motley denied a defense
request to call Meese as a witness, saying his actions had nothing
to do with the guilt or innocence of those on trial. Meese has not
been charged with any wrongdoing.
   The final witness in the trial Tuesday was Toni Patricia Biaggi,
Richard Biaggi's wife. She was called by the defense for her
supposed familiarity with her husband's dealings.
   During cross-examination by prosecutors, however, she admitted
that she was unaware of the existence of two companies in which her
husband owned 50 percent of the shares and served as director.
   Prosecutors said the companies, Four Star Military Marketing
Corp. and the Five Star Realty Corp., were vehicles through which
the younger Biaggi was paid kickbacks from military contractors
doing business with Wedtech.
   Mrs. Biaggi also said her husband never told her anything about
Martin Marietta Corp. Earlier in the trial, a former director of
operation at Martin Marietta, John W. Paxton, said the congressman
telephoned him ``at least two, maybe three or four times,'' to urge
the company to select Wedtech as a subcontractor.
   All of the defendants except Biaggi, his son and Bernard
Ehrlich, the congressman's former law partner, took the witness
stand during the trial, which began March 11.
   Biaggi had intended to take the stand himself until Motley gave
prosecutors wide latitude to cross-examine the congressman about
his past, including his conviction in an unrelated case on charges
of accepting an illegal gratuity.

   A team led by Texas troubleshooter Red
Adair extinguished the largest fire still burning on the Piper
Alpha platform, which was ripped apart by an explosion two weeks
ago, operators said today.
   Occidental Petroleum Corp., one of the rig owners, said a fire
in the wellhead was put out Tuesday night but that four other wells
continued to burn.
   Adair's team pumped hundreds of gallons of sea water into the
well to cool it before capping it with cement, said a company
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Work was halted today, she said, because of strong winds that
were blowing smoke and flames onto the Tharos, the rescue rig
floating alongside the platform.
   A huge explosion following by a raging fire wrecked the North
Sea platform 120 miles off Scotland on July 6, killing 167 men. It
was the worst oil rig disaster in history.
   Two-thirds of the platform sank, trapping many victims. Police
said three more bodies were brought to the surface Tuesday and
early today, bringing to 35 the number of bodies recovered. Another
131 men were missing.
   Nearly 2,000 people, including relatives, survivors and

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on Iran accepting cease fire
resolution:
   Iran shocked and surprised the diplomatic world Monday by
announcing that it accepted a year-old U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for a cease fire in its bloody, eight-year war
with neighboring Iraq.
   With its fingers crossed against disappointment, the Reagan
administration called the step a ``major breakthrough'' toward
peace.
   With grim suspicion, Iraq saw a ``tactical'' move by the
``devious Iranian regime.''
   Whichever view proves correct, Tehran's statement still must be
welcomed. It was the first time it had talked about an
unconditional truce.
   Iraq may be making the diplomatic error of refusing to take yes
for an answer. It should enter U.N.-mediated negotiations with Iran
to see where they lead.

   The Seattle Times on the Mexican election:
   In 1846, the United States stole half of Mexico, and this
country has never felt obliged to pay much attention since.
Mexico's presidential election may change that.
   After 60 years of popular allegiance, the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party held on to power by a whisker. Carlos Salinas
de Gortari won the presidency by a humbling 50.36 percent of the
vote. His predecessors never received less than 70 percent.
   Democracy is messy, and the proof will come in the
protest-filled streets of Mexican cities. Minority parties on both
the left and right believe Salinas' narrow win is as much of a
fraud as his party's string of victories since 1929. ...
   Over the years, the United States has lectured and wagged a
finger at Mexico about drugs, pollution, Central American politics
and immigration. ...
   Mexico is still smarting over what it considers the unwarranted
condemnation of its drug-enforcement efforts by Congress.
   As new, angry voices gain ascendancy in Mexico, Washington may
have to listen for a change.

   Anchorage (Alaska) Daily News on George Bush at the United
Nations:
   A few days back, Vice President George Bush said that he
couldn't wait to tell the United Nations the U.S. view of the July
3 Iranian airliner tragedy.
   But now that he's had his say, it's clear Bush's narrow view of
events wasn't worth the buildup.
   Bush couldn't resist a recitation of this country's right to
sail the Persian Gulf and a detailed review of Iran's many sins in
its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Clearly the United States does have a right to use the gulf.
Clearly Iran's radical government has conducted a bloody war
against Iraq that frequently has been characterized by outright
barbarism.
   But ... Bush's account of the war was distorted. Iraq is as much
to blame for the war as Iran. If the Iranians have attacked neutral
ships _ so have the Iraquis. If Iranians repeatedly have shown
contempt for the United States _ so have the Iraquis. ...
   Bush spent his visit to the U.N. talking at the Iranian
delegation _ and the television cameras. That might be great for
his campaign against Democrat Michael Dukakis, but it didn't do
anything to improve our relations with Iran or bring peace to the
Persian Gulf.

   The Times of Trenton, N.J., on Dukakis-Jackson:
   Gov. (Michael) Dukakis made a mistake, we think, in not
personally notifying Jesse Jackson of (his vice presidential)
selection before it became public knowledge.
   The governor may well have been irritated by Jackson's refusal
to close down his campaign and by his public insistence that he had
somehow earned first refusal of the vice presidential nomination.
   Even so, by committing what Jackson and his followers can
interpret as a discourtesy, Dukakis has created a needless problem
for himself.

   San Antonio (Texas) Express-News on the cost efficiency of
prisons:
   Tough prison sentences for hardened criminals serve the cause of
justice, but some fear that they cost more than taxpayers can
afford.
   A recent Justice Department study has some reassuring news:
Keeping repeat offenders behind bars actually is cheaper than
granting them early release.
   The department's research arm, the National Institute of
Justice, found that the average prisoner costs $25,000 a year _
including prison construction and maintenance expenses.
   But crimes committed by repeat offenders who have been freed
early cost about $430,000 a year in losses to victims and in
outlays for police, courts, etc.
   It is true that many prisons are overcrowded. The remedy is not
to turn their inmates loose, but to build more prisons.

   The Financial Times: (conservative)
   ``The... Democratic Party... for the first time in more than a
quarter of a century... has begun to present a united front to the
American electorate. This gives it a chance, although not a
guarantee, of victory in the presidential election. Much of the
credit for creating the party's new-found sense of unity must go to
the Democratic candidate, Mr. Michael Dukakis, whose own reputation
is that of being slightly to the left of center _ in American terms
a cautious liberal _ on domestic issues, and a more or less unknown
quantity on foreign policy.
   ``(Dukakis) reached an understanding with the powerful Mr.
Jackson...
   ``This understanding could, however, eventually damage the
party's chances of victory... The package of policies that he has
pushed for is too far to the left for a party that seeks victory.''

obtain the support of Mr. Jesse Jackson and his followers, Mr.
Dukakis has agreed to label South Africa a terrorist state.
   ``...And as a further sop to Mr. Jackson, Mr. Dukakis has agreed
to abandon the demand for a Cuban withdrawal from Angola,
notwithstanding the fact that even the MPLA (Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola) government now agrees on the need for it.
   ``Atlanta is a long way from southern Africa, and Mr. Dukakis

an (identity) crisis common to many progressive parties in the
West, like the British Laborites and the German Social Democrats,
that have suffered in these years the offensive of neo-conservative

   ``The U.S. Democrats don't want to be cast in obsolete

   La Stampa: (moderate)
   ```Governing from the center' is the message that the possible
protagonists of the Third Chapter of the American political scene
seem to want to present in Atlanta, certain that the public will
join around this flag.
   ``It is a possible project but not an easy one. It is thus that
the Atlanta Convention appears so `unheroic,' so difficult to
relate to as a great event. Yet, if it does not go badly, if there

   Bonnie Bedelia is drawing good reviews for
her role in ``Die Hard,'' which co-stars Bruce Willis of
television's ``Moonlighting,'' but she says she's convinced her
success will depend on how well the film does at the box office.
   ``I'll believe it when I see the lines around the block,'' Miss
Bedelia said in a recent interview.
   Miss Bedelia has a reason for her ``wait-and-see'' attitude. Her
1983 portrayal of auto racer Shirley Muldowney in ``Heart Like A
Wheel'' brought her an Oscar nomination but little else.
   ``Nothing happened after `Heart' and I don't know why,'' she
said.
   ``Well, I do know why. It didn't make any money, and this is,
after all, a business. You don't get ahead just because you're
good. I see no evidence of that anywhere. The only commmon
denominator among people who have become stars is that their films
did well. It's not fair, but who ever said life was fair?''
   In ``Die Hard,'' she plays a woman whose career forces her to
move her family to Los Angeles, leaving behind her husband, a New
York City police officer. When he visits her and their children for
Christmas, the two get caught up in a terrorist attack.

<HEAD>Text of Iraqi Letter Calling for Talks With Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of an Iraqi letter from
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz sent Wednesday to Secretary-General
Perez de Cuellar. The unofficial English-language text was provided
by the Iraqi Mission and Iraqi News Agency.
   Your Excellency:
   I have the honor to refer to the recent development in the
situation after Tehran informed the U.N. of its acceptance of
Resolution 598.
   We need to move from the stage of generalities to the practical
stage in which we could test the Iranian position, whether it is
serious or tactical or which has partial or temporary solutions
instead of reaching comprehensive and lasting solutions, stemming
out of our deep commitment to our responsibility toward reaching a
comprehensive and lasting peace as soon as possible.
   We suggest to Your Excellency and to Iran the following
practical steps:
   Motivated by a deep feeling of responsibility towards reaching a
comprehensive and lasting peace as soon as possible, Iraq has
proposed five practical steps to the United Nations and Iran:
   1. Holding of a meeting between authorized representatives from
Iraq and Iran at the United Nations Headquarters to be followed by
another meeting in Baghdad and Tehran later under the auspices of
the U.N. Secretary-General or his representative to begin formal
and direct talks on measures to enforce the U.N. Security Council
Resolution No. 598 in accordance with the sequence of its operative
articles.
   In case that a difference of viewpoints emerges on that, it
would be natural to resort to the U.N. Charter, international law
and the Geneva Agreement of 1949 on prisoners of war.
   We call for a meeting to be held as soon as possible and our
proposal to hold a meeting in Baghdad or Tehran besides the
proposed meeting is aimed to create appropriate atmospheres for
signing an agreement on comprehensive and lasting peace between the
two countries.
   2. In view of the importance of the Shatt Al-Arab issue which we
had reaffirmed in our correspondence and talks with you, Mr. Perez
de Cuellar, and the Security Council members and in our official
statements, we hereby (request) that you ask the specialized bodies
at the United Nations to immediately undertake the task of clearing
the Shatt Al-Arab waterway for navigation in a manner which would
enable the two countries to utilize it.
   We also propose that these bodies should work out a specified
timetable and provide the necessary possibilities to accomplish
this task as soon as possible. The two countries are also required
to submit all assistance and facilities to these bodies in a
constructive spirit in order to accomplish its task speedily.
   3. Iraq's full rights in free navigation in the Arab Gulf waters
and the Strait of Hormuz should be guaranteed immediately.
   4. While hoping to reach an understanding between the two sides
to reach a speedy agreement for lasting and comprhehensive peace
and good neighborlihood between the two countries as a basis for
comprehensive peace inthe region, it would be natural in case of
partial or complete failure to reach this objective that you (Mr.
Perez de Cuellar) and the U.N. bodies undertake an active role in
facilitating the task of direct formal talks and to provide
viewpoints and advice which facilitate the task of the negotiations
whenever that deemed necessary and the Security council would
remain having the effective role in accordance with its
responsibilities under its charter to intervene in taking
appropriate decisions whenever that deemed necessary.
   5. Iraq calls upon Iran to refrain from intercepting or
attacking ships and oil tankers operating in the territorial waters
of the Gulf states which are not part in the conflict and in the
high seas and the Strait of Hormuz.
   We hope that Iran would respond favorably with these practical
proposals and that you take the initiative in endorsing them and
take the necessary steps to enforce them.
   (Signed)
   Tariz Aziz
   Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Ministers

   Michael Dukakis today called his successful quest
for the Democratic presidential nomination ``a real kick,'' saluted
the last of his campaign opponents and worked on the speech he will
deliver to party delegates and millions of American voters.
   Dukakis also delivered an anti-drug message and praised his
wife, Kitty, for her activism on behalf of the homeless and
refugees.
   ``This has been a real kick,'' Dukakis told a reception held in
honor of his wife.
   Dukakis, who called Jesse Jackson this morning and planned to
meet with him this afternoon, congratulated his rival for his
speech to the convention Tuesday night and also heaped praise on
Jackson's five children.
   ``I thought to myself just how lucky we are to have the families
we have,'' Dukakis said. ``And just how important this institution
we call the family is.''
   At a morning briefing, Christopher Edley, Dukakis' issues
director, said the acceptance speech Dukakis will give Thursday
would invoke the same theme the Masschusetts governor emphasized
during his campaign. ``We're going to let Dukakis be Dukakis,''
Edley said. It will focus on economic security and opportunity and
accuse Republicans of ``romantic attachment to the status quo in
both domestic and foreign policy,'' Edley said.
   Later, speaking to a youth club in nearby Conyers, Dukakis said
young people can lead the fight against drugs. ``You tell me what
you want me to do as president,'' he said.
   Dukakis arrived around noon at the Georgia governor's mansion
for lunch with Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris and other governors.
``I feel great,'' Dukakis said.e
   On Tuesday, Dukakis huddled with speechwriter Bill Woodward for
several hours reviewing a draft speech which senior aides said
contained an upbeat message focusing on economic opportunity and
praise for Jackson and Dukakis' chosen running mate, Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen.
   Jackson's rousing speech and Texas Treasurer Ann Richards'
lively address to open the convention Monday will be tough acts to
follow for Dukakis, known for anything but his oratory.
   The nominee-to-be acknowledged that on Tuesday after touring the
Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Change with Bentsen
and Coretta Scott King, the widow of the slain civil rights leader.
   Neither he nor Bentsen, said Dukakis, ``have ever won any blue
ribbons for great oratory. ... None of us will meet the standard
Ann Richards and Jesse Jackson set for this convention.''
   Nevertheless, Dukakis promised leadership that would ``inspire
and uplift this country.''
   In a brief speech that included several quotations from King,
Dukakis described the civil rights leader as ``a man of action. He
was a man of inspiration.''
   Later, Dukakis met briefly at his hotel with Hispanic members of
Congress. Both Dukakis and Bentsen speak fluent Spanish, and Rep.
Albert Bustamante of Texas said Dukakis promised to involve
Hispanics in the campaign and in the transition team if he is
elected.
   ``He wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the
Hispanic community in Congress,'' said Bustamante. ``We were real
pleased.''
   After that session Dukakis took a ``power walk'' with an aide in
Atlanta's Piedmont Park.
   Dukakis had dinner at the hotel with his wife before she and
their children attended the convention. Dukakis stepped out to a
fund-raiser before returning to the hotel to watch the Jackson
speech and to work on his own.
   With him at the fund-raiser was his Academy Award-winning
cousin, actress Olympia Dukakis, who will introduce the nominee to
the delegates Thursday night.

   A lake was reopened today after scientists
found no remaining traces of bacteria that sickened at least 120
swimmers.
   Officials said they believe an infected swimmer defecating in
Beltzville Lake, not leaking sewage, introduced the shigella
bacteria, which causes shigellosis. Swimming at the reservoir has
been banned since July 12.
   Shigellosis typically causes acute diarrhea, fever and cramps
and can be fatal in people who were ill before contracting it. None
of the victims of the outbreak here has been in danger of dying,
health officials said.
   Health Department officials said the lake was contaminated July
8. Test results returned Tuesday revealed no traces of the
bacteria, said Department of Environmental Resources spokeswoman
Susan Woods.
   Water-borne shigella usually are killed by sunlight within a few
days, officials said.
   Ms. Woods said the state will continue twice-a-week testing of
the 949-acre reservoir.
   ``The common thread was that every person who tested positive
for shigellosis not only went swimming at Beltzville July 8, but
could recall either swallowing water or having water go up their
nose,'' said Health Department spokesman Bruce Reimer.
   While individual cases of shigellosis are fairly common, health
officials said outbreaks such as this are rare. The federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta reported 12 outbreaks in the past 10
years.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ One black soldier was killed
and 12 were seriously injured today when two grenades were thrown
into the back of their military vehicle, police said.
   Two unidentified men tossed the grenades into the rear of a
troop carrier as it was picking up the soldiers in Katutura, the
main township outside Windhoek, said police spokesman Kierie du
Rand.
   The South-West African People's Organization said in a dispatch
to the Mozambican news agency, AIM, that SWAPO guerrilla forces
were responsible for the attack.
   However, the SWAPO Press Agency said 24 soldiers were injured,
and it identified the dead solder as a South African. The SWAPO
release did not give the race of those it said were killed and
injured, but said the attack occurred in Katutura.
   The soldiers injured are part of the South-West Africa
Territorial Force. South Africa has administered South-West Africa,
also known as Namibia, for 73 years despite a 1978 U.N. resolution
calling for independence for the territory.
   SWAPO has been fighting against South African rule since 1966.

<HEAD>FDA Plans No Futher Ban on Sulfites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration has decided
against putting broad restrictions on the use of sulfites in foods,
according to an FDA memo obtained today. A consumer health group
says up to a million people could be endangered by sulfites.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said that a memo
from FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young to Health and Human Services
Secretary Otis Bowen indicates that the FDA plans to declare as
safe nearly all currently unrestricted uses of sulfiting agents in
food.
   A separate action is pending to extend a 1986 ban on the use of
sulfites on fresh fruits and vegetables, such as salad bar items.
Fresh potatoes have been exempted from the ban, but FDA spokesman
Chris Lecos said a proposed extension affecting fresh potatotes
would probably go into effect later this year.
   Lecos said the agency had no comment on the memo, which he said
was not available through his office. Nancy Tiller of the FDA's
executive secretariat, acknowledged the existence of the memo but
said it was not for public release.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy from a source outside the
agency.
   FDA officials estimate that sulfites are dangerous to about 10
percent of the 10 million people in the United States with asthma
and to a small number of non-asthmatics. But the chemicals, which
have been used for decades to prevent discoloration in food and
also are used in some drugs to help them maintain their potency,
are put in the category formally known as ``generally regarded as
safe.''
   The June 20 memo outlines plans on the regulation of sulfite use
in foods and drugs. The memo accompanied more than 100 pages of
proposed regulations with a recommendation that they be acted upon
by July 30.
   The memo said the FDA had considered prohibiting all uses of
sulfites in food, prohibiting it in additional foods, or requiring
labeling of all sulfite-treated food used in restaurants but
rejected all of these proposals..
   Mitch Zeller, staff attorney for the consumer health group,
predicted that the FDA's position is likely to be approved by
Health and Human Services, saying it ``does so little and bends
over backwards to placate the food industry.''

the ``voodoo antics'' show why he should be ousted.
   Florala Mayor H.T. Mathis, standing on the steps of the
Covington County Courthouse, read a proclamation at a midnight news
conference saying ``National Voodoo Week'' begins at midnight
Friday.
   Mathis, who faces an impeachment trial next month on charges of
mismanagement and improperly pardoning drunken drivers, stood in
front of a table that had candles, several Halloween masks and a
black rubber bat hanging on a string. Snakes were taped to his
shoulders.
   The 85-year-old first-term mayor said the publicity generated
last year when he sprinkled ``voodoo dust'' around Florala's City
Hall has been good for the town of 2,200 residents on the
Alabama-Florida border.
   ``The voodoo story, like a television commercial, has notified
thousands of people that Florala is a solid little town and it's
ideally located for any type of industry,'' Mathis said.
   But later Wednesday morning, Attorney General Don Siegelman made
it clear he wasn't amused.
   Mathis ``continues to be a threat to the public safety and an
embarrassment to the people of Florala and Covington County,''
Siegelman said, adding that the news conference ``demonstrates his
incompetence.''
   Siegelman said the ``voodoo antics'' ``may or may not be'' an
issue in his impeachment trial.
   Mathis accused Siegelman, who initiated the impeachment
proceedings, of ``trumping up the charges for his own political
gain.''
   Calling himself a Christian, Mathis said he does not believe in
black magic, but that since the media has turned him into the
``voodoo mayor'' he will use the opportunity for publicity.
   Siegelman has accused Mathis of mismanagement and improperly
pardoning more than two dozen drunken drivers. Mathis, who is
seeking a second term, said he has pardoned numerous driving
convictions because of what he calls overzealousness by city police.
   Siegelman asked a judge to impanel a county grand jury, which
brought the charges. A state court jury will hear the case. If he
is convicted, Mathis would be removed from office but would still
be able to run in this year's election.
   Sue Chambers, Mathis' daughter, said she was afraid her father's
credibility might be hurt. She said her father was making a mockery
of voodoo.
   ``I hope they will take it for what it's meant, but I don't know
that,'' she said.
   Regardless, Mathis said he planned to continue using voodoo.
   ``It's more or less fun. It's a joke. I do not believe in it, so
far as I'm concerned,'' said Mathis. ``Now there's a lot of
witchraft going on, though. There's a man (practicing it) just
across the Georiga line.''

<TEXT>
   With trumpet fanfare and honor guards, Queen
Elizabeth II celebrated with Parliament on Wednesday the 300th
anniversary of the Glorious Revolution that curbed royal power and
paved the way for democratic freedoms.
   The queen, speaking in Parliament's 11th-century Westminster
hall, told 1,500 lawmakers and guests the bloodless events that led
to constitutional monarchy and a bill of rights ushered in ``an
epoch of freedom under the law.''
   ``It was the beginning of a political process which has
continued to the present day,'' she said, flanked by the bewigged
leaders of the two British houses of Parliament, as well as leaders
of nearly 40 Commonwealth countries which inherited their
parliamentary systems from the British empire.
   Some wore British-style black robes, others turbans, tricorner
hats or tribal skirt and beads.
   ``No one could claim even today that the state has been
perfected. In multi-cultural Britain, there is still a long way to
go,'' she said. ``But after 1688 there were signposts to point the
way.''
   A bevy of royalty including the heir to the Dutch throne, Prince
William of Orange, and a U.S. delegation led by former Supreme
Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger from the College of William &
Mary in Virginia, also sat near the queen during the
pageantry-filled ceremony.
   William and Mary, a staunchly Protestant Dutch prince and his
English bride, took over the throne as constitutional monarchs
ruling with Parliament's consent after opposition to the
authoritarian, pro-Catholic rule of James II, England's last
absolute monarch, drove him to exile. Mary was James' daughter and
William his nephew and third in line to the English throne.
   After the new monarchs arrived from Holland, they accepted a
parliament-made declaration of rights which became law in 1689 and
underlined Parliament's powers, called for it to meet frequently,
and for its members to enjoy free speech and be elected freely.
   It barred the throne from imposing taxes or raising armies in
peace time without Parliament's approval.
   Nearly 100 years later, the restless American colonies drew from
the English bill of rights and its resistance to authoritarianism
in drafting their own Declaration of Independence and Constitution.
   ``It was a good example,'' said Burger, chancellor of the
college which was founded by William and Mary in 1693 and
designated by the U.S. Congress with presidential approval to
represent the country at the ceremony.
   ``The Glorious Revolution was really the concept of `we the
people,''' he said in an interview before the ceremony. ``It was
the beginning of the end of the divine right of kings.''
   Wednesday's ceremony was one highlights of a year of
tercentenary celebrations. The tercentenary, which will be feted
with events from exhibitions to bicyle races, also has raised
controversy.
   Some historians argue that after 1688, power remained with the
upper classes and Catholics were oppressed, most notably in
Ireland, where James tried to stage a comeback and was defeated by
William in 1690 at the Battle of the Boyne.
   Jonathan Clark, an Oxford University professor who has written
two books on the era, said in an interview that freedoms evolved
slowly.
   ``(They) must be defended, but I don't think they can be
safeguarded by pointing to one document. It's dangerous to deal in
illusions,'' he said.
   Addressing Wednesday's gathering, Speaker of the House of
Commons Bernard Weatherill said, ``Some have questioned the
significance of the revolutionary settlement of 1689 and the
motives of those involved.
   ``But the facts are plain. Before the bill of rights was passed,
those rights often had been set aside or denied. Since 1689, they
have never been successfully challenged.''
   The queen, her husband the Duke of Edinburgh and the Dutch
Prince William were spending the night at Torbay in southern
England, near the spot where William landed. On Thursday they will
watch 400 Dutch and British boats re-enact William's arrival.

<TEXT>
   White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater on Wednesday defended his former boss, Vice President
George Bush, against the ``Where was George'' attacks of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy and delegates to the Democratic convention in
Atlanta.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., repeatedly asked ``Where was George'' on
specific issues in a speech at the convention on Tuesday night,
prompting delegates to chant the same words in response.
   Fitzwater, who was Bush's press secretary before becoming White
House spokesman, commented, ``George was cutting taxes, not raising
them. George was defending America, not tearing it down. George was
leading the drug interdiction effort, not blowing smoke. And George
was pushing arms control, not cutting defense.''
   The spokesman declined comment, however, on an apparent
reference to first lady Nancy Reagan in the convention speech of
Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson told the delegates that, in fighting drug abuse, it is
necessary to do more than ``just say no,'' Mrs. Reagan's anti-drug
slogan, or to consult an astrologer, as Mrs. Reagan has
acknowledged that she does on some matters.
   ``In the course of the convention, you are going to see all
kinds of hyperbole and outrage and silly statements from all of the
candidates and party members,'' Fitzwater said. ``That's what
conventions are all about, but we won't respond to them
individually.''
   Fitzwater said he did not know what parts, if any, of the
convention President and Mrs. Reagan had watched on television at
their ranch north of Santa Barbara, where they are vacationing. He
said he assumed they were watching parts of it.

   Michael Dukakis, often depicted as the high-tech
governor, used pen and paper to work on the words he would use to
accept the presidential nomination because he doesn't use a
personal computer, aides said Wednesday.
   Dukakis spent much of his private time during the Democratic
National Convention putting the speech through at least three major
drafts _ with the revisions entered into a word-processing computer
by aides.
   ``The governor does not use a computer,'' said Christopher
Edley, the campaign's issues director.
   ``I've only tried to get him to use a lap top (computer) once,''
he added. ``He humored me for three or four minutes, and that was
it.''
   Aides did not invite comparison to Jesse Jackson's emotionally
stirring speech of the night before _ except, Edley said, both
would prove to be ``kind of a greatest hits'' collection from
earlier campaign speeches.
   ``We're going to let Dukakis be Dukakis,'' Edley said.
   Ensconced in his penthouse hotel suite, Dukakis has been going
over triple-spaced drafts of the speech prepared by two aides,
penning changes between the lines, in the margins and on legal pads.
   Aides discussed Dukakis' preparations as the Massachusetts
governor was still at work on the speech he is to deliver Thursday
night. They said the final version was not yet prepared.
   Edley said Dukakis plans to place primary focus on creating
``economic opportunity and security'' for all Americans and also to
touch on ``redirecting'' foreign policy in areas such as Central
America and South Africa.
   He will criticize the Republicans for ``romantic attachment to
the status quo in both domestic and foreign policy,'' Edley said.
   But the speech is not planned as stridently partisan.
   ``It will be a positive speech,'' Edley said. ``There is not
going to be a harsh, partisan edge to it. That is not the Dukakis
style.''
   Aides said no surprises were planned and that he would to stick
to the basic themes and issues he commonly mentions: affordable
housing, quality education, health care and advance notice to
workers losing jobs because of plant closings.
   ``For much of the public that will be watching this speech, it
will be the first serious look at who Michael Dukakis is and where
he wants to take this country,'' Edley said. ``So an effort to
distill the essence of the candidacy is perfectly appropriate.''
   ``The message doesn't change from week to week; the themes don't
change from week to week,'' he said.

   Four burglary suspects raced across
two county lines, abandoned their car on Interstate 95 and ran _
straight into a Palm Beach County Sheriff's substation.
   They left a North Miami used car dealership after a break-in
Tuesday in a 1988 four-door Oldsmobile, then ran out of gas in
Delray Beach, said sheriff's Sgt. Ken Deischer. They jumped a fence
and ran, he said.
   ``They didn't know this was the courthouse, let alone the
sheriff's office,'' Deischer said. ``They ran right to the
building.''
   Sgt. Mark Bannon was parked in back at 5 a.m. when he saw the
four men run into the parking lot. Another officer had radioed that
the suspects had run from their car minutes earlier, but Bannon was
still surprised.
   ``I looked up, and here they are,'' he said. ``I guess they
picked the wrong spot to bail out of a car.''
   The four were arrested and charged with burglary and grand theft.

   Houstonians on Wednesday cranked up their pitch
to host the 1992 Democratic National Convention. They also tried
not to sound pleased about the problems Atlanta is having.
   Officials locked the doors to The Omni arena Tuesday night
because of an overflow crowd that wanted to hear Jesse Jackson's
speech.
   On Wednesday, Houston officials were ready with a T-shirt
response in support of their 1992 bid.
   ``We have space for you in '92,'' said the shirts distributed to
Texas delegates to wear during the Wednesday night presidential
nomination vote.
   Back in Houston, Mayor Kathy Whitmire planned to attend a
convention watch party at the George R. Brown Convention Center,
the massive, new downtown building that Houston unsuccessfully
pitched for the 1988 convention.
   Don Ward of the Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau offered a
graphic comment on the relative merits of The Omni and the Houston
site.
   ``The George R. Brown would contain three Omnis. You could keep
all the press and everything under one roof,'' he said in Atlanta.
   The press is housed here in the Georgia World Congress Center
adjacent to The Omni.
   ``We'd like to show them what a real convention center looks
like,'' Ward said.
   Texas Democratic Chairman Bob Slagle said he did not want to
sound like an ungrateful guest here, but ...
   ``It's always embarrassing when anybody gets locked out of a
Democratic convention for any reason. We pride ourselves on
inclusion. It's a shame and I'm sorry it happened,'' he said of the
Tuesday night lockout.
   ``It's not the most useful hall we ever worked in,'' Slagle said
of The Omni. ``If you like being crammed in like a sardine, it's a
pretty nice place to be.''
   Claire Giesen of Houston, an aide to U.S. Rep. Mike Andrews, did
not complain about the weather as she handed out stickers that
feature a big blue ``92,'' which at times can seem like the average
humidity on a summer day in Houston.
   ``The weather has been great. Perfect weather,'' she said of the
hot, humid Atlanta days.

   Kitty Dukakis, recalling her 26-year
addiction to amphetamines, urged a group of children Wednesday not
to use drugs, telling them that since she was cured ``life is so
much sweeter.''
   ``I couldn't stop using them and I became addicted,'' she said.
``The words I want to say to you are `don't start.'''
   Her husband, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, stood by her
side as she spoke, just hours before he was to be nominated as the
Democrats' choice for president.
   ``I probably wouldn't be here today as the wife of the
Democratic nominee for the presidency of the United States,'' Mrs.
Dukakis said. ``I'm not sure that my husband would be running for
the presidency of the United States if I was still using them.''
   Later, at a reception held for Mrs. Dukakis by the Democratic
National Committee, Dukakis saluted his wife as a trusted adviser
and said she would be an active first lady.
   ``I don't have to tell you I'm blessed with a wonderful
spouse,'' Dukakis told the gathering at Atlanta's Fox Theater.
``You're going to hear about homelessness from Kitty Dukakis and
you're going to hear about refugees.''
   At the morning event in Conyers, Mrs. Dukakis told the children
gathered outside a building that serves as home to the area's Boys
Club and Girls Club that she began taking the pills at the age of
19 because she wanted to lose weight. She urged young girls in the
audience with similar worries to eat well and exercise and to steer
clear of drugs.
   Mrs. Dukakis, who disclosed her amphetamine addiction last year,
said she has not used drugs since she entered a Minnesota treatment
center in 1982.
   ``I gave credit for everything good that happened to me to the
pills because I didn't think I could do anything without them,''
she said. ``Life is so much sweeter.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said her husband did not know of her addiction
because she already was taking the pills when they met.
   ``He didn't know me any other way,'' she said. ``Now he knows be
different.''
   ``It's even better this way,'' Dukakis replied. He called for
drug education programs beginning in kindergarten and urged the
children to discuss drugs with their parents.
   After the DNC reception, Mrs. Dukakis was to watch the
convention events, including the nomination of her husband, with
him in their hotel suite.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed an $18
billion energy and water bill Wednesday and commended Congress for
enacting the measure promptly and holding spending to levels
acceptable to the administration.
   Reagan said in a statement that the bill had been submitted to
him earlier in the year than any other appropriation bill since he
took office in 1981. He urged the lawmakers to act quickly on the
remaining 12 appropriations bills.
   The bill is the first regular spending measure to get Reagan's
signature since December 1985.
   In recent years, appropriations bill have been lumped together
in catchall emergency spending measures enacted at the end of the
fiscal year. The bills are being enacted separately this year as a
result of last fall's deficit-reduction agreement between Reagan
and congressional leaders that decided in advance the overall
spending levels for military, foreign aid and domestic agency
programs.
   ``As I noted in my State of the Union address earlier this
year,'' Reagan said, ``the use of ... patched-together,
multiple-purpose spending bills does not permit the legislative and
executive branches to exercise proper scrutiny of government
spending.''
   ``The public interest is best served when budget laws are
enacted individually, after careful deliberation ... and well
before the crisis atmosphere sets in at the end of the fiscal year
in September,'' he said. ``I therefore urge the Congress to
complete consideration of the remaining 12 appropriations bills and
to transmit them to me in a timely manner as well.''
   Reagan said the appropriations in the energy and water bill ``do
not exceed the amounts I requested in my budget while fully funding
the essential requests for atomic energy defense activities.''
   ``I want to take this opportunity to commend the Congress ...
for keeping funding contained in this act at acceptable levels,''
he said.
   The bill was one of five signed by the president as he
vacationed at his mountaintop ranch north of Santa Barbara.
   The others were an authorization bill for the National
Transportation Safety Board, a codification of measures affecting
the Defense Department, a measure reauthorizing U.S. participation
in an international energy program, and a bill naming a federal
courthouse in Portland, Maine, for Judge Edward Gignoux.

   President Reagan's spokesman said
Wednesday that the Contras face a ``period of uncertainty'' but
that the election of Col. Enrique Bermudez to the directorate of
the Nicaraguan resistance will likely prove beneficial to the
Contra cause.
   Marlin Fitzwater also said that ``we would not expect his
becoming an official member of it to change the policies or
directions in any substantial way.''
   When asked about the resignations of seven commanders in the
resistance force's Southern Front in protest of Bermudez's
ascension to the top leadership post, Fitzwater replied, ``I don't
really know what the seven commander situation is in terms of
exactly what their status is now or how that will affect the
operations of the Contras themselves. ... I don't think there's
anything to worry about.''
   Fitzwater said that the leadership of the resistance force was
merely ``getting its act together'' and that the Contras face a
``period of uncertainty.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has unilaterally extended a
cease-fire to Aug. 30, but at the same time, his Sandinista regime
recently cracked down on political opponents and expelled U.S.
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven associates.
   Seven commanders along the Contras southern military front quit
the organization Monday after Bermudez, 56, was elected to the
seven-member directorate of the resistance force.
   Bermudez was a colonel in President Anastasio Somoza's army
before Somoza was deposed by the Sandinistas in 1979.
   Fitzwater said that concerns about the colonel's past
connections with Somoza ``have always been there for anybody who
wanted to draw on them. The fact is, he has been the military
leader of the Contras. He has not hidden that fact.''
   The spokesman said the resistance force has some internal
problems because of ``Congress' cutoff of funds and the
uncertainties that they've faced in the peace process.'' He said it
appears that the Contra directorate ``is trying to fashion a course
as best they can at this point, and the election of Bermudez ...
should be helpful in the sense that he's been an integral part of
the military leadership all the way.''

<TEXT>
   A branch of a bookstore chain owned by
Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson sold books stolen from a
competitor, according to a police complaint, but company executives
said nobody at the branch knew the books were stolen.
   The University Co-Op bookstore at the University of Texas has
lost an estimated $600,000 in stolen texts in the last year and
says some of those books ended up two doors away at a branch of
Wallace's Bookstores Inc.
   Co-Op President George Mitchell said Tuesday he believes a theft
ring specializing in textbooks and advanced professional journals,
a few dishonest employees and lax security combined to make the
bookstore easy pickings.
   University Co-op said in its complaint that the Wallace's branch
paid $2,000 for technical books on advanced engineering, chemistry
and other subjects and re-sold them for $4,000 to independent book
broker Wes Berkovsky.
   Mitchell said he was angry that Wallace's bought and sold the
books without notifying him. Another Austin bookstore, Half-Price
Books, bought $1,400 worth of books but called as soon as it
realized they were stolen, Mitchell said.
   It was the second time Wallace's Bookstores has been involved in
a stolen books case this year. In a Georgia case, executives of
Lexington-based Wallace's also denied knowing that a supplier had
been shipping stolen books to the central warehouse in Lexington,
Ky..
   Wilkinson founded the company and is chairman, but he has not
been involved in its daily operation for several years, according
to bookstore employees.
   The stolen books' retail value was estimated as low as $20,000
by Wallace's officials in Lexington and as high as $44,000 by
Berkovsky, according to a report Tuesday in the Lexington
Herald-Leader.
   John Schudy, manager of Wallace's Austin store, said he did not
remember buying technical books or selling them to Berkovsky.
   Mitchell said no one from Wallace's told him stolen Co-op books
were being offered to other book dealers, nor did anyone suggest
that Wallace's had been offered books that might have been stolen
from the Co-op, he said.
   Schudy said he went to the Co-op only to discuss ways the Co-op
could reduce shoplifting, not to show Co-op employees suspicious
books.
   Half-Price manager John Wiley said he became suspicious after
two men appeared several times wanting to sell books, ``about half
of which had titles I couldn't even pronounce.''
   ``After a while, you get suspicious,'' Wiley said. ``When a guy
who looks like he doesn't study very much walks in with a $100 book
that he is more than willing to sell for $2 or $3, something isn't
right. It's unfortunate, but it's something that happens. Students
are particularly vulnerable.''
   Although Wilkinson has disavowed involvement in the company's
daily operations, the Herald-Leader reported that state telephone
records show dozens of calls between the governor's office and
Wallace's headquarters.
   Doug Alexander, Wilkinson's press secretary, said most of the
calls to the book company were probably his, seeking information on
the governor's business background for reporters.

   A hosiery industry group is cranking out

going to have a lot of little socks for people that really need
them,'' he said Wednesday.
   Last year the Tennessee chapter celebrated National Hosiery Week
by hoisting a 65-foot sock, made by sewing together quilt-type
pieces donated by mills and hosiery-related companies, atop an arts
and community center in Morristown, Tenn.
   This year's project is the work of the Tennessee Chapter of the
National Association of Hosiery Manufacturers. The national
association and its chapters are composed of hosiery mills,
packagers, yarn suppliers and other businesses that deal with
hosiery.
   The 45 businesses in Tennessee's chapter consider the project
part of National Hosiery Week events scheduled for Aug. 14-20.
   The Tennessee chapter, Houck said, is aiming for the socks to
reach all 438 Salvation Army offices across the Southeast by early
fall, in time for the cold months ahead.
   This month, various mills began sending their donated socks to a
distribution point in Chattanooga for assembly into crates
containing 20 dozen pairs each. Each crate will have socks for
infants, children and adults, he said.
   Mills are sending a range of their products and specialties, not
just white tube socks, he said.
   ``It will be a veritable rainbow of socks,'' he added.
   ``Spinning plants are donating the yarn, printers are donating
their services and packagers the cartons. And, of course, the
manufacturers are knitting the socks,'' Houck said.
   The donated socks are destined for 14 states, Houck said. They
are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.

<BYLINE>GOP Leaders Make it Clear They're Running Against `Troika'
^By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican leaders made it clear Wednesday that
they plan to direct their fall political attack against a
Democratic ``troika'' that includes Jesse Jackson as well as
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   Illinois Gov. James Thompson said Michael Dukakis granted
Jackson virtually the same status in the campaign as he did
Bentsen, the Texas senator he has picked to be his vice
presidential running mate.
   ``Governor Dukakis has accepted Jesse Jackson as his partner in
this campaign, elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps
higher than his nominal running mate Lloyd Bentsen,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson called it a clever strategy to offer Bentsen as ``the
soothing, reassuring conservative.'' But he said, ``My guess is
those two partners of the troika, Dukakis and Jackson, will soon
leave Bentsen in the dust.''
   Thompson's comments came as part of a Republican ``truth squad''
which has held dailing news conferences this week in Atlanta to
present the GOP side of things during the Democratic convention.
Thompson was joined by Virginia Sen. John Warner and Texas Rep.
Beau Boulter, who is running against Bentsen for the Senate.
   All used the term ``troika'' to describe the Democratic ticket,
repeatedly mentioning Jackson, who most polls show hurts Democratic
chances in the fall campaign against certain nominee George Bush.
   ``Michael Dukakis has tied Jesse Jackson to this ticket rather
firmly,'' Thompson said. ``With Bentsen whispering in one ear and
Jackson whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen
to? ... I think that's the question the American people need to
have answered.''
   Thompson himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate
for Bush, but he downplayed any suggestions that he was campaigning
for the job.
   ``There are a number of qualified candidates,'' Thompson said.
``There's no lack of talent in our party.''
   In addition to being Dukakis' pick for the No. 2 spot on the
ticket, Bentsen is running for re-election to his Senate seat,
simultaneous campaigns that are allowed under Texas law.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen wants it both ways,'' Boulter said, contending
that Bentsen should ``have the courage to decide which office he
wants to run for.''
   The selection of Bentsen as a running mate is viewed as an
effort to cut into Republican strength in the South, but Boulter
said Republicans will make sure the conservative Texan is saying
the same things in all regions of the nation.
   ``In the other 49 states, he's going to have to campaign, I
suppose, on Michael Dukakis' platform,'' Boulter said. ``I expect
him to say different things in Texas, to the voters there, than
he's saying in the other 49 states.''
   Boulter also repeated GOP attacks on Bentsen for the $6 million
campaign chest he's built for his Senate race, arguing that money
will be spent instead to boost the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   Warner, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, attacked Democrats for the platform they adopted on
Tuesday.
   ``The defense platform, indeed, is a smokescreen,'' Warner said.
``Clearly we're seeing deception in the areas of national defense
and foreign policy.''
   In another attack on the Democrats, L. Brent Bozell, executive
director of the Conservative Victory Committee, previewed planned
television ads criticizing Dukakis for his 1977 veto of a bill
requiring school children to recite the pledge of allegiance.
   ``He's a 100 percent dyed-in-the-wool bleeding heart liberal
who's completely out of touch with the American public,'' Bozell
told a news conference.

<HEAD>Police Still Looking For Stolen Dynamite In Convention City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement authorities in the city playing
host to the Democratic National Convention searched a second day
Wednesday for 100 pounds of dynamite stolen from a suburban
blasting company.
   Although police said there was no indication the theft was
related to the convention, which has brought an estimated 35,000
visitors, the FBI said it was giving the matter more than routine
attention.
   ``We're not treating it as a run-of-the-mill thing,'' said
Atlanta agent Diader Rosario. ``Any time you have a situation where
explosives have been stolen, certainly it is a very serious
matter.''
   Police spokeswoman Myrna May said there had been several
reported sightings of a tan van that was used to transport the
dynamite.
   One was near the state Capitol and another was near The Omni,
where the convention is being held, she said. On Wednesday, bomb
squad officers were searching tan vans in the convention zone.
   Rosario said the FBI was aware of a reported threat to blow up
an abortion clinic, but added, ``I don't have any (further)
information regarding that.''
   Henry County sheriff's Capt. Keith McBrayer said two cases of
explosives were stolen Tuesday from a blasting company worker. Each
case contained 50 pounds of dynamite, or about 200 sticks, and 200
blasting caps, he said.
   Besides the FBI, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Secret
Service and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
joined police from Atlanta and Henry County in searching for the
explosives.

   Wearing a hat that resembled a large chunk of
cheese, Wisconsin delegate Tom Harnisch drew double-takes from
amused pedestrians on Atlanta's downtown streets Wednesday.
   ``I don't think it could be much more embarrassing to walk
around with your pants down,'' Harnisch said as he walked to a
hotel for a Democratic National Convention reception.
   But Harnisch, a former two-term Wisconsin state senator, said
all the stares and occasional snide comments were worth it.
   After all, Wisconsin is known as America's Dairyland, and his
home of Neillsville is in the 3rd Congressional District, which has
more dairy cows than people.
   ``Many people seem to know immediately that I'm from Wisconsin
because of the hat,'' Harnisch said.
   Others don't know what to make of the large, triangular-shaped
hat.
   ``They look at you like you're goofy,'' Harnisch said.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini told his
people Wednesday accepting a truce with Iraq was like drinking
poison, but asked them to support his decision and said those
``martyred'' by the war had benefited.
   Until this week Khomeini had been adamant in opposing an end to
the war, which began in September 1980 with border skirmishes and
an Iraqi invasion, until President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was
driven from power.
   ``I shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more
deadly to me than poison, but I am happy to submit to God's will
and drank this cup for his satisfaction,'' the 87-year-old
revolutionary patriarch said in a statement.
   Although the statement said he could not immediately reveal the
reasons for changing his mind, it said he acted on the
recommendation of military and political leaders. Khomeini's
statement was his first since the government said Monday it would
accept a year-old, U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   ``In view of the opinion of all high-ranking political and
military experts ... I agreed with the acceptance of the resolution
and cease-fire, and under the existing juncture I believe this to
be in the interest of the revolution and the system,'' he said. His
statement was distributed by Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency which was monitored in Nicosia.
   Iran's acceptance of U.N. Resolution 598 does not mean the war
is over, Khomeini said, but added that the decision was not just a
tactic to allow the Iranian military to regroup. Iraq has made that
accusation.
   He said the war had been ``good for the people who were martyred
and good for those whose children were martyred.'' Western
estimates put the number of dead and wounded in the 8-year-old
conflict at 1 million, divided about evenly between the two sides.
   Shiite Moslems, the overwhelming majority in Iran, revere the
martyrdom of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson Hussein in 680, in an
Islamic factional war from which the Sunni and Shiite branches of
the faith developed.
   Khomeini repeated several times that he did not want to accept
the resolution and said he felt ``ashamed in front of such a great
nation.'' He also told the public and media not to create a furor
over questions that would not be answered immediately.
   The patriarch said Iran has yet to settle accounts with the
United States, which he calls the ``great Satan,'' and with Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait.
   ``I hereby warn the American and European military forces to
leave the Persian Gulf before it is too late,'' he declared,
without elaboration. About 60 foreign warships are stationed in and
around the gulf, 27 of them American.

<HEAD>Director Retiring at Think Tank That Shaped Reagan Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Hoover Institution, the think-tank
that generated many of the Reagan administration's conservative
ideas, must pick a new leader of its own following a decision by
its long-time director to step down.
   W. Glenn Campbell's decision follows months of debate about the
affiliation between Stanford University and the on-campus
institution that will soon be home to Secretary of State George
Shultz and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Campbell, who succeeded founder and former President Herbert
Hoover in 1960, said the new director will have to ``be a leader
who can provide a climate where all these prima donnas can live
together.''
   The announcement came two months after Campbell vowed to sue if
Stanford tried to oust him at 65 because it was the customary
retirement age at the university. Campbell had planned on staying
another five years.
   Campbell said he is stepping aside in part because he's weary of
fighting Stanford. ``I used to be a young warrior, now I'm an aging
warrior but not yet an old warrior,'' he said.
   Six Nobel laureates are associated with the think tank,
including economist Milton Friedman and Soviet writer Alexander
Solzhenitsyn.
   President Reagan is an honorary fellow, and several of his
advisers, including economist Martin Anderson, national security
expert Richard Allen and special envoy Philip Habib, are among the
more than 100 Hoover scholars.
   Campbell met with Hoover's Board of Overseers on Wednesday and
said he would make a public statement Thursday at the conclusion of
the meeting.
   However, in an interview Monday with The Associated Press, he
described his decision, his vision of Hoover's future and his
assessment of its achievements under his leadership.
   His legacy, he said, is the development of an ``institution of
ideas and distinction, filled with distinguished scholars who can
exchange ideas with each other.''
   He is proud that ``Hoover participated in the Reagan
`revolution' and in the promotion of peace,'' he said.
   Over the next decade, he said, he'd like to see Hoover
strengthen its Pacific Basin program, create a fund for the
promotion of peace, reach out more to the public through the media
and become the site of a separate professional school for
international relations.
   Campbell said Hoover will keep its independence from Stanford
and remain an important policy research center.
   ``I hope the president will come here regularly again after he
gets over his annoyance with Stanford's administration and
faculty,'' Campbell said, referring to the university's rejection
last year of a Reagan library and policy center.
   Meese has accepted Campbell's invitation to join Hoover as a
visiting fellow while he writes a book on his years with Reagan.
   Shultz, an honorary fellow, will return to work on a series of
documentaries on policy-making at the State Department while he
teaches a public policy course at Stanford's Graduate School of
Business.
   Campbell said he would not fight the decision of Stanford's
trustees to retire him next year, probably about six months after
he turns 65 in April, but said he wanted to make sure there is a
smooth transition to his successor.
   He said he would hold the title of counselor, serve as
ex-officio member of all selection and advisory committees, and
stay in his current office, formerly occupied by President Hoover.
   Campbell had originally called Stanford's effort to retire him
``an attempted takeover'' motivated by politics and greed and noted
several exceptions to the retire-at-65 rule.
   Stanford President Donald Kennedy and former trustees' President
Warren Christopher were Carter administration officials, and the
majority of the faculty are Democrats.
   Campbell, an unabashed conservative Republican, said the problem
between Hoover and Stanford is not as simple as politics alone.
   ``All these people (at Stanford) want is the money and
buildings,'' said Campbell, whose large wood-paneled office is on
the 11th floor of the landmark Hoover Tower in the center of campus.
   Campbell, a Harvard economist who once had former Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker as a student, helped boost a $2
million endowment to its current level of more than $110 million.
   John F. Manley, a liberal professor of political science at
Stanford and a longtime Hoover Institution critic, has denounced it
as ``a political operation in the midst of what is supposed to be a
non-partisan university.''
   However, Seymour Martin Lipset, a Hoover sociologist and
political scientist and former Johnson administration official,
said Hoover should not be labeled a ``conservative think tank.''
   He said Hoover's fellows have ``a range of political opinions
and interests that covers the gamut from socialist to extreme
conservative.''

<HEAD>FCC Moves Toward Phone-Company Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission moved a
step closer Wednesday toward allowing telephone companies to
provide cable television services.
   An 18-year-old FCC rule and a 4-year-old law bar telephone
companies from running cable systems in their own service areas,
but the FCC indicated by a series of actions Wednesday it favors
lifting those prohibitions.
   The commission called the prohibitions a draconian form of
regulation that no longer is needed because the cable industry has
become large and strong enough to compete with the telephone
companies.
   The FCC voted tentatively to recommend to Congress that it
repeal the 1984 prohibition against telephone companies providing
cable television services and directed its staff to begin the
process of repealing its own rule against such activity.
   It also asked the staff to formally define what would be ``good
cause'' for waivers of the prohibition as allowed by the law and
the rule. By that action, the commission indicated that it could
use waivers to allow telephone companies into the cable television
business even if the l984 law is not rescinded.
   If telephone companies are allowed to operate cable systems the
consumer will benefit from increased video services, including home
shopping and video phones, as well as having an additional source
of pay television programming, the commission said.
   James P. Mooney, president of the National Cable Television
Association, suggested that consumers' basic phone bills would
increase if the telephone companies delve into cable television.
   ``Consumers ... would find themselves forced to subsidize
high-risk investments in pay TV. The only certain results would be
to push telephone rates even higher than they are now,'' he said in
a statement.
   While it will be up to Congress to lift its prohibition and the
FCC is not expected to develop a final recommendation to Capitol
Hill until later this year, the commission made clear it believes
the existing prohibitions are out of date.
   Cable companies can serve about 80 percent of the homes in the
nation, the commission said.
   Thus, in contrast to 1970 when the commission rule was adopted,
telephone companies no longer can ``enjoy the advantage of being
the first provider of cable television service or preemptively
eliminate competition from independent cable operators,'' the
commission said.
   There is a ``general consensus'' among the FCC commissioners
that the current prohibitions against cable-telephone cross
ownership ``are no longer the most appropriate or most desirable
form of regulation,'' Gerald Brooks, chief of the FCC's common
carrier bureau, told reporters.

   Michael Dukakis, saying ``I think it's for
real,'' was poised to win the Democratic presidential nomination
tonight in a prime-time roll call of delegates energized by waves
of ridicule directed at George Bush.
   ``This has been a real kick,'' Dukakis said this afternoon,
looking back over a 17-month quest for the nomination and the right
to challenge Republican Bush in November.
   Standing alongside his wife, Kitty, at a reception, the
Massachusetts governor said, ``As we we came into Atlanta on
Sunday, I turned to my bride and I said, `Well, I think it's for
real. I mean this is happening.''' The audience cheered.
   Both Dukakis and Jesse Jackson, survivors from a field of seven,
will have their names entered in nomination. Dukakis began the day
with a commanding 2,763 delegates, compared to 1,161 for Jackson
and had exercised his muscle by winning a brief and moderate
platform.
   Jackson, who captivated the convention with a forceful address
Tuesday night, acknowledged the obvious this morning. Asked if he
planned to endorse and work for the ticket, he said, ``Oh, yes I
am.'' He said his role ``must be defined by Gov. Dukakis.''
   Just hours before tonight's convention session, the two
candidates met privately in Dukakis' hotel suite for more than an
hour, accompanied by senior aides and Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
Dukakis' running mate.
   Afterward, Jackson said, ``Basically it was a get-acquainted
meeting for staff and key policy advisers, most of whom do not know
each other but now must work together since we are in the same boat
with a common objective _ that is, to win in November.''
   Jackson added: ``As you end the primary campaign, you fold in
some means of becoming friends, developing new and different
relationships.''
   Earlier, Dukakis toured the Omni convention hall, trying out the
podium where he will deliver his acceptance speech Thursday night.
Dukakis aides said the governor was still working on the address,
which has gone through multiple drafts.
   Christopher Edley, campaign issues director, said Dukakis would
focus on economic security and opportunity and would accuse the
Republicans of ``romantic attachment to the status quo in both
domestic and foreign policy.''
   ``We're going to let Dukakis be Dukakis,'' Edley said.
   At the afternoon reception, Dukakis spoke warmly of his wife and
said both he and Jackson were blessed with good families.
   He said a woman in tobacco-rich North Carolina told him recently
she planned to vote for him. When he asked why, she replied: ``Your
wife smokes.''
   Making clear he wasn't happy about the fact that his wife does
smoke, Dukakis said, ``I don't have to tell you what kind of first
lady she's going to be: a non-smoking first lady.'' Again, the
audience laughed.
   Earlier, the nominee-in-waiting telphoned Jackson and told him,
``I thought the speech was terrific.''
   Dukakis spent part of the morning at a youth club in Conyers
outside Atlanta discussing the battle against illegal drugs. He
said young people can be the best helpers in that effort and he
told the youngsters, ``You tell me what you want me to do as
president.''
   Dukakis, who has spent much of his time the past several days at
his hotel headquarters, said, ``The problem with being a candidate
is they never let you out of the hotel room, so this is a joy to
me.''
   Jackson, even though he is certain to lose, said he wants his
name placed in nomination ``as a testament to the struggles of our
fathers and mothers.''
   He said today that his ``mission'' was to pave the way for a
black to win the White House.
   ``My children and your children will get through those doors,
and the White House is within reach,'' he told NBC's Bryant Gumbel,
the ``Today'' show's black anchorman. ``I am pushing back barriers
and removing ceilings off of dreams every day. I see it as my
obligation, in a real sense now my mission.''
   Jackson had his night in the spotlight Tuesday, delivering a
graceful swan song before a noisy and excited house. Citing
dangerous overcrowding, police sealed all entrances to the Omni
shortly before Jackson spoke, locking out about 1,000 delegates,
guests and reporters.
   Inside the hall, Jackson declared, ``We meet tonight at a
crossroads, a point of decision. Shall we expand, be inclusive,
find unity and power, or suffer division and impotence?
   ``The only time we win is when we come together,'' Jackson said,
as his supporters waved a sea of red banners proclaiming,
``Jesse.'' On orders from Dukakis' floor leaders, the governor's
supporters kept their own blue-colored placards out of sight.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and other speakers trained
their sights on Vice President Bush, the certain nominee when the
Republicans convene next month in New Orleans.
   Kennedy derided Bush as the man who ``keeps burying his head in
his hands and hiding from the record of the Reagan-Bush mistakes.''
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower told the delegates
that Bush was a ``toothache of a man'' who doesn't care about the
problems of anyone but the rich.
   ``George has always been in another world. His is an upper-class
world in which wealth is given to you at birth,'' Hightower said.
``He is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a
triple.''
   The convention already had rebuffed Jackson's calls for higher
taxes on the wealthy and a pledge to reject the first use of
nuclear weapons. Instead, delegates approved a Dukakis-endorsed
platform worded in such general terms that it won't provide much of
a target for Republicans.
   Showing no sign of defeat, Jackson told the delegates, ``Tonight
I salute Gov. Michael Dukakis. He has run a well-managed and
dignified campaign. No matter how tired or how tried, he always
resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery.''
   Jackson said, ``His foreparents came to American in immigrant
ships. My foreparents came to American in slave ships.
   ``But whatever the original ships, we are in the same boat
tonight.''
   ``Keep hope alive! Keep hope alive! Keep hope alive,'' he
shouted in conclusion, sparking an eruption of cheers and applause.
   As the party's nominee, Dukakis will face Bush, the target
during the second night of the convention of verbal abuse from some
of the Democrats' top stars.
   Bush emerges today from the seclusion of a fishing trip in
Wyoming to go on the campaign trail and try to divert attention
from Dukakis' triumph. The vice president will campaign in the
Detroit area in the first stop on an eight-state tour.

<HEAD>FDA Rejects Appeals to Broaden Ban on Sulfites In Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unpublished memo written by the head of the
Food and Drug Administration shows the agency wants to reject
proposals for broader limitations on sulfite food preservatives,
despite estimates that the chemicals can be extremely dangerous to
a million or more Americans.
   A consumer health group said Wednesday the FDA's failure to act
endangers many asthmatics and others who have a severe reaction to
sulfites, including the possibility of death within hours after
food containing the chemicals is eaten.
   Sulfites, which have been used for decades to prevent
discoloration in food, have been banned since 1986 for use on fresh
fruits and vegetables, such as those sold in salad bars. Fresh
potatoes have been exempted from the ban, but will be included
later this year, FDA officials say.
   The FDA memo, written by Commissioner Frank E. Young, says the
agency proposes to affirm its classification of sulfites as
``generally recognized as safe'' for other foods. Young
acknowledges in the document that many new uses have been found for
sulfites and that ``a significant number of individuals'' have
experienced ``severe allergic-type responses.''
   Other FDA officials have estimated that sulfites are dangerous
to about 10 percent of the 10 million people in the United States
with asthma and to a small number of non-asthmatics, according to
agency spokesman Chris Lecos.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a privately
funded consumer health group, says sulfites have caused coma, brain
damage and at least five deaths.
   Young's memo says that a 1987 sulfite labeling requirement for
some packaged foods would be extended to additional items, but not
to dehydrated or frozen potatoes, which would remain exempt.
   Under existing rules all drugs must be labeled as to sulfite
content.
   The June 20 memo was addressed to Health and Human Services
Secretary Otis Bowen, whose department must sign off on over 100
pages of regulations that accompanied the document.
   Mitch Zeller, staff attorney for the consumer group, predicted
that the FDA's position would be approved by Health and Human
Services, saying it ``does so little and bends over backwards to
placate the food industry.''
   Lecos said the FDA had no comment on the memo. Nancy Tiller of
the FDA's executive secretariat, acknowledged the existence of the
memo but said it was not for public release. The Associated Press
obtained a copy from a source outside the agency.
   The memo said the FDA had considered prohibiting all uses of
sulfites in food, broadening the ban to include other foods or
requiring labeling of all sulfite-treated food used in restaurants.
   The memo says ``the available safety data'' does not support a
complete ban or an extension to foods other than those already
covered, except for fresh potatoes. Health groups have said it
should also cover processed and frozen potatoes.
   Restaurant labeling would be ``labor intensive and difficult to
enforce,'' the memo says, adding that it would require regular
inspection of over 500,000 eating establishments.
   The memo asks for action on the proposed regulations by July 30.

   An investigator testified
Wednesday that a Lebanese Shiite Moslem charged in the hijacking of
a TWA jet admitted joining a radical group linked to the
kidnappings of Westerners in Beirut.
   The defendant, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, told the court trying him
that he hates the United States, which sought his extradition.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 1985
hijacking of TWA flight 847 to Beirut. Thirty-nine Americans were
held captive for 17 days, and a U.S. Navy diver was killed during
the ordeal.
   West German federal police investigator Heinrich Brandtjen said
Hamadi admitted joining the radical Hezbollah group after the TWA
hijacking.
   Hamadi was arrested and charged with carrying liquid explosives
at Frankfurt Airport in 1987.
   ``He told me he has belonged to Hezbollah since the autumn of
1985 or 1986, but I cannot remember exactly the year,'' Brandtjen
told the court.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella
organization for pro-Iranian groups holding 18 foreign hostages in
Lebanon, including nine Americans. Hamadi denied last week that he
had been a member of Hezbollah.
   One of Hamadi's brothers, Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, is the Beirut
security chief of Hezbollah. Another brother is accused of
kidnapping two West Germans in Lebanon in a bid to force German
authorities to free Mohammed Hamadi.
   When Brandtjen was asked if Mohammed Hamadi's actions were
linked to those of his brother Abdul-Hadi, Brandtjen said: ``He
told me that he had stood under the orders of his brother,
Abdul-Hadi Hamadi... He told me his brother was not directly
involved in military operations of Hezbollah, but had a mediating
role between rival factions.''
   During the time the questioning was taking place, the West
Germans were coming under pressure from Washington to extradite
Hamadi to the United States, a request which was ultimately turned
down.
   When Hamadi was given a copy of the U.S. extradition request,
Brandtjen quoted him as saying, ``I had nothing to do with that
(hijacking).''
   In his testimony last week, Hamadi said his admissions to
Brandtjen came as a result of threats by West German authorities to
extradite him to the United States unless he confessed. Brandtjen
said no threats were made against Hamadi.
   The defendant also read from a statement he started Tuesday and
criticized U.S. policy in the Middle East.
   Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger asked him: ``Do you hate the
U.S.A.?''
   ``I grew up in Lebanon in the middle of the war, and one
naturally asks himself _ why? The answer was always America, or
Israel with support of America,'' Hamadi replied. ``I have hateful
feelings for all that attacked us, not just for the U.S.A. alone,''
Hamadi said through an interpreter.
   Abbas Hamadi, 29, was arrested Jan. 26, 1987, at Frankfurt
Airport when he returned after the kidnappings of West Germans
Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt in Beirut. Schmidt was freed in
September, but Cordes remains a hostage.
   Abbas Hamadi was convicted in April of masterminding the
kidnappings in a bid to force his brother's release and sentenced
to 13 years in prison.

<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday identified
four Arabs it suspects of being involved in a terrorist attack on a
Greek cruise ship and tied the leader to a 1978 killing claimed by
the Abu Nidal terrorist group.
   Public Order Minister Anastasios Sehiotis said police had been
able to piece together events leading up to the attack by gunmen on
passengers of the liner City of Poros on July 11. Nine people were
killed and 98 were wounded in the gunfire and grenade attack off a
Greek island.
   Sehiotis said the government suspects that Hejab Jaballa, who
holds a Libyan passport, led the guerrilla attack.
   Police had also identified Jaballa as taking part in the
assassination of an Egyptian newspaper editor in Nicosia, Cyprus,
in 1978, he said.
   Jaballa's fingerprints from Cyprus were matched with those
uncovered in his Athens hideouts, Sehiotis said.
   Renegade Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal said in a magazine
interview after the Egyptian was shot that his group was
responsible for the assassination. Abu Nidal, whose real name is
Sabri Banna, gets much of his funding from Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi and maintains headquarters in Tripoli.
   Sehiotis identified the other three suspects as Aboul Amoud,
Adnan Sojod and Merhi Mehieddine. Their nationalities were not
known. The minister read a prepared statement and declined to
answer reporters' questions.
   The statement failed to clarify whether any of the suspects were
dead or had fled the country.
   Police believe that one or possibly two of the suspects may have
died either in an explosion on the ship's bridge as they lobbed
hand grenades or in a car bomb that apparently detonated
prematurely at a marina near Athens six hours before the City of
Poros was scheduled to dock.
   Two occupants of the car were killed by the explosion.
   The minister said Jaballa arrived in Greece on a flight from
Copenhagen June 1. His alleged accomplices arrived from Beirut via
Belgrade in May.
   All four men rented apartments or stayed in various hotels,
changing locations often prior to the day of the ship attack,
Sehiotis said.
   ``All the evidence indicates that Jaballa played the leading
role in the terrorist operation since he had all the details of
members of his group in his possession,'' said Sehiotis.
   Ministry officials distributed copies of photographs from forged
passports found in hotel rooms and apartments the men allegedly
stayed in and at the site of the car explosion.
   Greek police have been reluctant to discuss what terrorist group
could be responsible for the attack on the ship. But CIA director
William Webster said in Washington last week that it appeared to be
the work of the Abu Nidal group.
   At a separate news conference, Merchant Marine minister
Evangelos Yannopoulos said security had been boosted at all main
ports and that commandoes would now be permanent crew members of
cruise liners.
   He said each ship would have ``five to 10 specially trained
commandoes'' aboard responsible for neutralizing terrorists attacks.
   Yannopoulos was asked whether a dead 23-year-old French
passenger, Laurent Vigneron, was part of the terrorist group. Greek
authorities have linked him to the attack, but French officials
have said they find no evidence he was involved.
   ``There are indications _ based on the testimony of four
witnesses _ that he (Vigneron) participated in the terrorist
attack,'' said Yannopoulos.
   He said an autopsy showed that Vigneron was hit by bullets in
his shoulder but these were not the cause of his death. He did not
elaborate.
   Meanwhile, security at the nation's borders, ports and at Athens
International Airport was tight.
   Passengers boarding cruise ships and ferries were scrutinized
closely and their luggage passed through X-ray machines.

<HEAD>Security Council Adopts Resolution On U.S. Downing of Iranian
Jetliner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Wednesday
unanimously adopted a mild resolution expressing ``deep distress''
over the accidental U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner and urging
rapid implementation of a U.N. cease-fire and peace plan.
   After days of negotiations and bargaining, the 15-member council
adopted a watered-down document that would satisfy both the United
States and Iran and would not provoke a U.S. veto.
   The council session was requested by Iran, which had boycotted
the council for eight years but returned to urge condemnation of
the U.S. military action and demand withdrawal of all U.S. forces
from the Persian Gulf.
   The USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Air jetliner on July 3 in
the gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. The United States said the
airliner was mistaken for an Iranian fighter jet.
   Iran was unable to muster enough votes to condemn the United
States.
   Diplomats said the council decided to delete controversial
passages to ensure passage of the brief resolution. It deleted a
sentence proposed by Iran calling on foreign naval forces to
reassess their presence in the Persian Gulf. It also deleted strong
language of condemnation of the U.S. military action.
   The resolution said the council ``expresses its deep distress at
the downing of an Iranian civil aircraates to be in their seats promptly
at the 7
p.m. EDT starting hour. More than a thousand people were locked out
on Wednesday night when authorities shut the coliseum doors due to
overcrowding.
   Thus was the stage set for the most peaceful nominating night
the Democrats have known since 1976 _ a result entirely unlike the
tumultuous brokered convention scenarios that were fashionable in
Washington political salons when the campaign year began.
   Dukakis made short order of those scenarios, as he did of his
rivals. He won the bronze medal when the first votes were counted
in the Iowa caucuses on a freezing cold night in February, but won
the gold in the New Hampshire primary the following week and
methodically began piling up delegates, first by the handful and
later by the hundreds.
   It was a success that capped a remarkable political comeback.
Elected governor of Massachusetts in 1974, he lost a re-election
bid in a primary campaign four years later in what his wife termed
a ``public death.''
   He renewed himself in his four years out of power, and has twice
won statehouse terms since.
   The Massachusetts governor went into the roll call with 2,798
delegates according to The Associated Press count, to 1,168 for
Jackson. That was hundreds more than the 2,082 needed to win.
   By day three the convention city had settled into a routine,
from the street vendors hawking everything from T-shirts to jars of
vidalia onion relish to the demonstrators showcasing their causes
in a parking lot set aside for them a few blocks from the hall.
   The security detail seemed large beyond numbers, from the Secret
Service to the Georgia state troopers, to the Atlanta city police
to the private security guards _ and more.
   Dukakis, the man at the center of it all, telephoned Jackson to
tell him, ``I thought the speech was terrific.''
   Aides said Dukakis had tried to reach Jackson the night before
at the podium but couldn't get through. There was irony in that _
Dukakis said last week he tried and failed to reach Jackson to tell
him of Bentsen's selection as running mate, but Jackson felt he had
been snubbed when he learned the news from a reporter.
   The result was an outbreak of political tension that wasn't
resolved until Dukakis and Jackson met privately for more than two
hours before the convention's opening session on Monday.
   But that was then, and this time, no one seemed to care if
Dukakis couldn't get his call through.
   Aides said Dukakis was polishing the acceptance speech that he
will deliver at the convention's final session Thursday night, and
would watch the nominating roll call on television in his hotel
suite with his family.
   At the luncheon for his wife, he chided her about her smoking
habits, and said she would make a great first lady _ a ``no smoking
first lady.''
   He added that when he arrived in Atlanta last Sunday to claim
his prize, he had told her, ``This is a kick...I think it's for
real, I mean it's happening.''
   In an interview on NBC's ``Today'' program, Jackson said his
mission was to pave the way for a black to someday reach the White
House. ``My children and your children will get through those
doors,'' he told Bryant Gumbel, NBC's black anchorman.
   Democrats who fell by the campaign wayside admitted to some
thoughts of what might have been, even though they rallied behind
the winner.
   ``Obviously there are mixed feelings,'' confessed Illinois Sen.
Paul Simon, whose own campaign ended during the spring.
   ``Reach for the hand of your fellow Democrat and hold on tight.
We're going to make this country over again,'' said Rep. Richard
Gephardt, who won the Iowa caucuses but quit the race a month later.
   Among the delegates, the talk was of a healed party and unity
for the fall campaign, and of Jackson's 45-minute speech on
Wednesday night.
   ``I think it was very stimulating, very conciliatory, and very
much what the party needs,'' said Chicago Alderman Juan Soliz, a
Dukakis backer.
   Ron Yengich, an alternate from Utah, was so moved by Jackson's
Tuesday night speech that he took a midnight detour on his way back
to his hotel, driving by the birthplace of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr.

   President Reagan's spokesman said
Wednesday the administration was not surprised by lingering
skirmishes in the Iran-Iraq war, voicing hope that it is merely a
prelude to a cease-fire.
   ``The fighting, of course, is continuing there, as I think
everyone assumed it would,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Briefing reporters at his seaside resort while Reagan continued
his week-long vacation, Fitzwater said, ``I think everyone assumed
it would continue until the cease-fire. ... So I think we should
all assume that the war is receding and we can expect skirmishes
until the cease-fire is agreed to.''
   Fitzwater commented not long after United Nations Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced he was dispatching a team
to Iran and Iraq to seek implementation of a ceasefire under U.N.
Security Council Resolution 598.
   Iran's government had announced Monday for the first time that
it was unconditionally accepting the cease-fire resolution. But on
Tuesday, Iraq bombed an Iranian nuclear power plant and hit other
Iranian industrial targets.
   Fitzwater said the administration welcomed Iraq's move to hold
direct talks with Iran as soon as possible on establishing a
cease-fire in the nearly 8-year-old war.
   Iraq's deputy foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, made the proposal in
a message to Perez de Cuellar.
   On another matter, Fitzwater reiterated that the United States
is interested in improving relations with Iran, but he said this is
not related to the continued captivity of eight Americans held
hostage by pro-Iranian elements in Iran.
   The spokesman said the administration was continuing to do
everything possible to win the release of the hostages but said
``we don't believe there should be any linkage'' of the
hostage-holding with the possible renewal of contacts with Iranian
government officials.
   ``We have had that signal out for a number of months ... and
whenever we have pressed them for names or assurances that there
were authoritative persons (with whom the U.S. could do business),
we didn't hear back,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said he thought that it had been ``at least a couple
of months'' since the United States made any attempt at direct
contacts with Iranian officials.
   ``We have continued to say that we're open to it, but it is up
to Iran, and that's where the ball is now,'' he said.
   Fitzwater has said in the past that the United States insists on
dealing with Iranians who can speak authoritatively for the
revolutionary goverment of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The spokesman said U.S. officials would have to be convinced of
the legitimacy of any Iranians who might be contacted because the
administration wants no repetitions of the Iran-Contra affair.

   The senator was pelted with questions: What was
he doing at the convention? How did his speech go the night before?
How would Michael Dukakis handle rural issues? And would Iowa
retain its first-in-the-nation presidential primary contest?
   Not exactly network fare.
   But it's the kind of interview that's going on dozens of times a
day at the Convention Satellite News Service, the Democratic
Party's equal-opportunity showcase for TV stations too poor to come
to the convention and politicians unlikely to show up on the
network evening news.
   ``Thank you all, this is a great thing. You're wonderful. You're
wonderful,'' Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa told the harried news service
staff after finishing an interview with a TV journalist in Sioux
City.
   Earlier this week, he had talked to stations in Cedar Rapids and
Ottumwa, all of them unable to afford the trip to Atlanta.
   `It's in keeping with my feelings about helping small
businesses, small stations,'' Harkin said. ``Heck, they ought to be
able to have access to me, too. The big boys can afford to come
themselves.''
   The Convention Satellite News Service, with 46 hours of
transmissions scheduled during convention week, is costing about
$300,000 _ all of it paid for by congressional campaign
organizations and associations of Democratic governors, mayors and
state party chairs.
   On a typical day this week, the service is featuring about 70
interviews and roundtable discussions on subjects such as the
gender gap and the Texas Factor, moderated by former CBS newsman
Ike Pappas; tape of senators and congressmen at their morning
issues forums, shot by three camera crews; and hours of live
evening floor coverage for any station that wants it.
   The studio for what is grandly called the Democratic National
Network is curtained off in royal blue, cluttered inside with two
cameras, eight lights, a couple of steel chairs with oatmeal
cushions, and a TV monitor on top of a metal suitcase.
   A brief attempt to beautify the set floundered when a vase of
roses borrowed earlier for the same purpose vanished from the
office across the hall. ``They're gone. So we don't do flowers,''
said Ginnie Kontnik, chief troubleshooter. Shrug. Next problem.
   The operators of the service are sensitive to criticism that it
can be considered a propaganda machine. But they note that many
hours are devoted to floor action and two-way interviews in which
questions come directly from reporters and anchors sitting in TV
studios in Montana or Iowa or Oklahoma or Maine.
   ``They're their own news editors, their own reporters. They ask
the questions. They edit the tape,'' said Kontnik, who is director
of the Harriman Communications Center for House members in
Washington.
   The questions are not the type that set a politician squirming.
But they're bread and butter for local newscasts. Tulsa viewers
probably do care about whether Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's selection
as vice president means anything to Oklahoma.
   ``He has a history of working with Oklahomans. He is a
neighbor,'' Rep. Mike Synar told an interviewer. He mentioned
Oklahoma in virtually every answer he gave, regardless of the
questions, beginning with a ringing prediction that ``Oklahoma is
going to be in the Democratic ranks for the first time in years.''
   A scrap of paper guided administrative assistant Gary Catron as
he questioned his boss, Rep. Richard Stallings of Idaho, in an
interview taped for stations in Twin Falls, Idaho Falls, Pocatello
and Boise.
   How will the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket play in the West? he asked
Stallings.
   Potential exists to carry many states, Stallings replied, adding
that Dukakis ``is tremendously interested in trying to find out
what our concerns are. That's a first. No other Democrat has shown
interest. Most tend to write off the West.''
   Cut.
   Next. In marched Rep. Harold Volkmer of Missouri. And the
frantic pace _ a new face every five minutes _ continued.
   ``This is insane,'' Kontnik said as she answered phone calls,
fielded questions, sent aides out on urgent errands and tried to
locate politicians scheduled for interviews five minutes later.
   ``Are we having fun yet?'' asked Paul Byers, manager of the news
service.
   Seriously, though, ``everybody seems to be happy,'' said Byers.
An aide told him, he said, that ``one TV station was so happy they
thought we had rehung the moon.''

<HEAD>For Some Delegates, Looking for Women to Talk About Women</HEAD>

   While other delegates to the Democratic National
Convention were shopping, sunbathing, eating lunch with mayors or
taking pictures of each other, Dorothy Eck and Helen Kerr were
engaged in more serious pursuits.
   They were talking with other women about problems facing women.
   ``We're here today,'' said Mrs. Kerr, ``because we suddenly
realized we are tired of listening to men.''
   When delegates look at the podium in the convention hall, she
said, all they see is men _ men keeping track of time, men ushering
in visitors, men orchestrating the playing or non-playing of music
and men hitting the buttons to move the podium up and down in order
to make 6-foot-2 Jesse Jackson and 5-foot-8 Michael Dukakis the
same height.
   She explained that she has no quarrel with the Democratic Party,
which is scrupulous about dividing delegate representation evenly
between men and women. She thinks, too, that women are well
represented among speakers.
   But, well, there is that pervasive presence of men _ especially
in the daytime caucuses and on the platform.
   ``This morning, when we were planning our day, Dorothy said
let's find some women to listen to,'' said Mrs. Kerr.
   That's how they wound up miles from the delegate-clogged
downtown area at a branch library where there was a ``Southern
Hospitality, Women's Style, Welcome Delegates'' meeting.
   Ms. Eck and Mrs. Kerr are from Bozeman, Mont., both are in their
60s, and they belie the image of the carousing, fun-loving delegate
who may or may not find time to make it into the convention hall.
   From early in the morning, when they attend a meeting of the
Montana delegation, to after 11 at night when the convention ends,
the two women are on the go. They went to a Democratic National
Committee seminar, then a session of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and after the women's meeting were going to
visit a musum. All this before a convention session lasting five
hours or more.
   ``We've got a choice of 20 places to go,'' said Ms. Eck, a state
senator who headed the Dukakis campaign in Montana.
   ``I was married to a regular Army officer and didn't open my
mouth,'' said Mrs. Kerr. ``Then I worked for the federal government
and didn't open my mouth. Now it's my turn to act.''
   She was particularly impressed with Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984
Democratic vice presidential nominee, who told a caucus Tuesday
that the reason more women aren't considered for national office is
because so few are running for other posts and working their way
through the system.
   Has she run for office?
   No, said Mrs. Kerr. ``I haven't the guts for it. I want
everybody to think I'm wonderful; it would hurt too much to find
out some people didn't think so.''

   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards said Wednesday that
all the attention generated by her keynote speech to the Democratic
National Convention is ``a little embarrassing'' _ and proceeded to
once again turn her acid wit on Vice President George Bush.
   Speaking to a meeting of women activists, Ms. Richards recounted
being asked by a reporter why women seem reluctant to support Bush,
who is the certain Republican nominee for president.
   ``I said it was very hard to explain unless you've ever gone to
a high school dance and looked at the stag line and there was that
guy raising his eyebrows at you and you said to yourself, `Oh Lord,
I hope he doesn't ask me,''' Ms. Richards said.
   On the opening night of this year's convention, Ms. Richards
unleashed a stinging attack on Bush, saying among other things that
he was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   Since that crowd-pleasing speech, Ms. Richards has been the
focus of heavy attention around the convention and on Wednesday,
she quoted some advice given to her by veteran feminist Bella
Abzug: ``You just lean back and enjoy it.''
   ``I find all the attention a little embarrassing,'' she said.
``I know who I am.''
   In addition, Ms. Richards dismissed with a joke suggestions from
admirers that she was vice presidential material.
   ``I am not prepared to be vice president,'' she said. ``I need a
lot more seasoning, I need a lot more experience, I need a lot more
broadening.
   ``I really know what my talents are,'' she said. ``I hope my
future is full of wonderful things. I think being vice president
would be great. I'm good at weddings, I'm good at funerals.''
   Ms. Richards also attacked the Reagan administration's record on
women's issues, pointing to small gains women have made in income
compared to men.
   In a voice dripping with sarcasm, she said: ``In eight years
it's almost a 5 percent increase. How can we possibly complain?
   ``As usual, it is up to the women to clean up the mess,'' she
said.

   Michael Dukakis, in an unusually jovial mood as
he prepared to be crowned his party's presidential nominee, cracked
a joke about his wife's smoking habit _ perhaps costing himself a
vote in North Carolina.
   At a luncheon reception for Kitty Dukakis hosted by the
Democratic National Committee, Dukakis spoke of a North Carolina
woman who approached him and promised her support.
   Dukakis said he asked the reason for the endorsement and was
told: ``Your wife smokes.''
   ``I don't have to tell you what kind of first lady she is going
to be,'' Dukakis said as his wife stood at his side. ``A
non-smoking first lady,'' he added, winning laughter from the crowd.

   Dukakis, known for his thriftiness, tried in vain Wednesday to
return a gift T-shirt because he said it was too big.
   After an anti-drug rally in Conyers, not far from the convention
city, the trim Dukakis was presented with a shirt bearing the logo
of the local Boys Club. As he held it up for photographers, Dukakis
glanced down at the tag.
   ``I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth,'' he said, ``but I'd
love to wear this this afternoon when I'm working out in Piedmont
Park. It's an extra large and that's a little big on me. If you've
got something a little smaller I could wear it.''
   Organizers of the event looked on awkwardly, as did Dukakis'
wife, Kitty, who also received a shirt from the local Girls Club.
   Dukakis kept the shirt.

   At a made-for-TV convention, the Dukakis campaign has flooded
The Omni arena with made-for-TV signs.
   Gone are the placards the campaign has used for more than a
year. They were predominantly white with blue lettering that read:
``Mike Dukakis for President.''
   The new signs match the red, white and blue colors of the
convention rostrum. The have large lettering reading, ``DUKAKIS,''
and a smaller tag line that reads ``President '88.''
   And they come in two sizes.
   Two people are needed to wave the larger signs effectively,
while a lone supporter can handle the smaller models.
   All told, 1,000 of the larger versions have been distributed on
the Omni floor, and 20,000 of the smaller models.
   Another Dukakis sign is to be unveiled Wednesday night as
Dukakis is nominated for the presidency. It says: ``Duke. Duke
Duke.''

   After spending five days in steamy Atlanta, Dukakis and his
running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, will hit the campaign trail together
for three days.
   The first stops will be Bentsen's home state of Texas Friday.
After appearances in McAllen and Houston, the pair will fly to
Modesto, Calif., and spend the night there.
   On Saturday they will campaign in Minot, N.D., and St. Louis.
The next day they will appear in Erie, Pa., before returning to
Boston.

   Israeli troops killed three Palestinians
Wednesday in clashes in the occupied West Bank, while hundreds of
policemen fired tear gas and rubber bullets in Jerusalem to quash
protests over the unsolved killing of an Arab high school student.
   One Arab was killed in the city of Jenin when troops opened fire
to disperse stone-throwing protesters who blocked major
thoroughfares, an army official said. A second Arab shot and
wounded in the clash died later Wednesday, the official said.
   Troops shot a third Palestinian as he tried to hurl a firebomb
at their patrol in Shuyukh village near Hebron, the official said.
   Six Palestinians were wounded in the clashes, the army said.
   It was the highest casualty toll in two months, bringing to 228
the number of Palestinians killed in the 7{-month-old revolt in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Four Israelis also have died.
   Two small groups of right-wing Israelis accompanied by more than
200 police and border patrolman in riot gear paid 20-minute visits
to Temple Mount, where the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques are
built on the site of the biblical Jewish temple.
   Jews are permitted to visit the site, which is called Haram al
Sharif in Arabic and is the third holiest site of Islam, but not to
pray there in groups.
   Gershon Solomon, leader of an organization that wants Jews to
regain control of the site, came down with a fistful of soil and
declared: ``My friends, we are going to lose Jerusalem. Without the
Temple Mount and without Jerusalem, the state of Israel cannot
exist. This is a terrible danger.''
   Hours earlier, the Supreme Islamic Council met with
representatives of eight foreign consulates and appealed for a halt
to Israeli archaeological digs near the mosque walls.
   In the Christian quarter of the Old City, policemen fired tear
gas at several hundred Arabs who started an illegal march in memory
of 15-year-old Nidal Fuad Rabadi, who was shot to death in unclear
circumstances Tuesday near the Jerusalem city limits.
   Police Chief Yosef Yehudai said authorities had no leads in the
shooting. He said Rabadi, a Jerusalem resident, had been arrested
four times in recent months for throwing stones at cars and buses.
   Both police and the army have denied involvement in the killing.
Arab journalists said Israelis driving to the West Bank may have
shot Rabadi when firing at youths who threw rocks at their cars.
   On Wednesday, police raided a house near the Rabadi home and
arrested 25 Palestinians, including some allegedly involved in the
critical wounding of a border patrolman on Tuesday.
   Hassan Muhamad, 21, is one of many members of the Arab Druse
minority who serve in Israel's armed forces. His skull was
fractured by a 45-pound concrete cinderblock that was dropped on
his head after Rabadi's funeral.
   The Palestinian killed when he tried to throw a firebomb in
Shuyukh village was identified as Zaki Halaykeh, 23. An official at
Alia Hospital in Hebron said the man was shot in the back.
   Three other young Arabs in Shuyukh were wounded, the army said.
   At Jenin, a hospital official said 26-year-old Hisham Zaid died
after soldiers shot him in the chest. The army said it was
investigating, and reported four Palestinians wounded in Jenin, one
of which later died.
   A Palestinian physician who leads the Charitable Societies
Federation, an umbrella group for West Bank charity groups, was
sentenced to three months in jail.
   Charges against him were not made public immediately, but Israel
suspects charitable societies of contributing to the rebellion by
directing local protests and distributing funds.
   One of the most successful protest actions has been an Arab tax
boycott. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Wednesday that tax
revenues from the occupied lands have dropped 40 percent since the
uprising began.
   Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, the deputy military chief of staff, told
the parliament that 5,600 Palestinians are in jail but some will be
released Sunday as a gesture on the Moslem holiday Id el Adha.
   Two Palestinian guerrillas were sentenced to life in prison for
infiltrating Israel from Jordan and a third was given 25 years, a
military court announced. They were captured by Israeli soldiers in
December after a border firefight in which one was wounded.

   The following are excerpts from a
statement Wednesday by Iran's leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
accepting a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire resolution toward ending the
Iran-Iraq war.
   It contains direct quotes from the address carried by Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency, Tehran Radio and Iran
televison and material paraphrased from the speech by IRNA. No full
text was released.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more
deadly to me than poison, but I am happy to submit to God's will
and drank this cup for his satisfaction.
   ``However, thanks to some incidents and factors that I do not
mention at this moment and God willing will become clear in the
future, and in view of the opinion of all the high-ranking
political and military experts of the country, whom I trust for
their commitment, sympathy and sincerity, I agreed with the
acceptance of the resolution and cease-fire, and under the existing
circumstances I believe this to be in the interest of the
revolution and the system.
   ``God knows that had it not been for the motive that all of us
and our honor and credibility should be sacrificed in the interest
of Islam and the Muslims, I would never have agreed with this
issue, and to me it would have been more bearable to accept death
and martyrdom.
   ``I strongly recommend to the dear nation of Iran to remain
alert and vigilant.
   ``The acceptance of the resolution by the Islamic Republic of
Iran does not mean a solution to the problem of war. Rather, by
announcing this decision, the propaganda weapons of the
world-devourers against us is blunted, but one cannot seriously and
decisively predict the outcome of events.
   ``The enemy has not abandoned his atrocities yet, and it is
likely that, by seeking excuses, he would continue his aggressive
methods. We must be ready and prepared to repulse the enemy's
possible aggression and our nation should not think the issue is
over yet.
   ``Of course we formally announce that our objective is not to
have a new tactic for continuation of the war.''
   Khomeini told the nation that in light of the situation it is
likely in future days some people may tend to indulge in polemics
about the wisdom of the decision but suggested this should best be
postponed until later.
   He said the war had been ``good for the people who were martyred
and good for those whose children were martyred.''
   On Islam's international policy, Khomeini said: ``We are trying
to enlighten other parts of the world with Islam. We have always
sought and are still seeking to put an end to the domination of
world-devourers over the oppressed nations and uproot capitalism,
communism and Zionism, without fearing that U.S. lackeys might
accuse us of pursuing a policy of expansionism or founding a great
empire.
   ``We will try, with all our might and even through armed
struggles, to prevent American policy-makers from spreading their
bullying policies.
   ``I hereby warn the American and European military forces to
leave the Persian Gulf before it is too late.''
   He praised freedom-loving Moslems who helped unveil ``the joint
U.S.-Saudi Arabian crime in Mecca,'' referring to the 1987 riot by
Iranian pilgrims in which 402 persons died, mostly Iranian. He
advised Moslems to strive to tilt the balance of power to their own
benefit or else the U.S. and the Soviet Union will create new
catastrophes under the pretext of safeguarding their vested
interests.
   Khomeini said that God willing, all Moslems would ``raise their
voice against all the world's oppressors and prove that the
superpowers and their servants and lackeys are among the most
despicable creatures of this world.
   ``Are the world's Moslems going to forget the tragedy of the
massacre of hundreds of scholars and thousands of men and women
belonging to Moslem sects, during the length of the shameless life
of the al-Saud (the ruling family of Saudi Arabia) and also the
tragedy of the massacre of the pilgrims in the house of God (Mecca)?
   ``The goverment of the al-Saud has taken over the responsibility
for controlling the pilgrims in the house of God. And it is here
that we say, with confidence, that the Mecca incident is not a
separate matter from the fundamental policy of the world-devourers
in routing free-spirited Moslems.''

<HEAD>Democrats' Rising Stars Strut Their Stuff at Party Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS in 3rd graf bgng ``Each harbors'' that Richards
would not be first woman governor of Texas.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   For a host of up-and-coming Democrats who aren't
named Dukakis or Jackson, the party convention provides a stage for
them to strut their stuff and dream of bigger days to come.
   Among the rising stars who got to perform before the crowd of
11,000 in The Omni and millions more watching on television:
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, selected to nominate Michael Dukakis on
Wednesday night, and Texas Treasurer Ann W. Richards, who skewered
George Bush in her folksy keynote address Monday.
   Each harbors higher ambitions, Clinton to run for president
himself one day, and Richards to become governor of the Lone Star
state in 1990.
   Others play out bit roles at the 40th Democratic National
Convention, often making their entrance when the cameras of the
national television networks are dark, or turned the other way.
   But for young politicians like Louisiana State Sen. Cleo Fields,
who is all of 25, and Texas State Rep. Lena Guerrero, 30, just
getting to the rostrum was a sign that somebody in the party
hierarchy liked them.
   Fields spoke with passion Tuesday evening on Jesse Jackson's
futile bid to get the party to oppose first use of nuclear weapons,
regardless of the circumstances. ``We must say America will not be
the country that will end this world,'' he declared.
   Guerrero, a Dukakis delegate from Austin, won high marks for her
role in drafting the party platform. She also made a prime-time
introduction Tuesday of Rep. Robert Matsui of California, who moved
the adoption of the no-frills platform.
   Another Texan, Jim Hightower, gave a national audience a taste
of the populist one-liners that have made him a force back home.
The two-term Agriculture commissioner has his eyes on a U.S. Senate
seat _ either Republican Sen. Phil Gramm's in 1990, or Lloyd
Bentsen's if the Democrats capture the White House and set off a
free-for-all for that vacancy.
   In a week filled with rhetorical fusillades aimed at George
Bush, Hightower may have scored a big hit with his quip, ``He is a
man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.''
   Although his speech Tuesday night did not light any fires,
Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard fulfilled his mission from party
chief Paul G. Kirk Jr. to produce a pithy platform devoid of
troublesome special interest promises.
   With a governor at the head of the ticket, the party also was
highlighting the accomplishments of Blanchard, who takes credit for
helping revive Michigan's economy, Clinton, a national leader of
welfare and school improvement efforts, Louisiana's reform-minded
Buddy Roemer and others.
   A film aired at the convention said these governors exemplify
``a new approach to problem solving: problem-solvers with an eye on
the balance sheet.''
   The party has other stars already established, including Al Gore
and other also-rans in this year's presidential contest, and some
of those considered presidential timber who chose not to run, such
as Mario Cuomo and Bill Bradley.
   Others, already well established, look to even larger roles down
the road: California Rep. Tony Coelho, the party whip, who had the
convention chanting ``Where was George?'' even before Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy used the same line; Arkansas Rep. Beryl F. Anthony,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; Rep.
Thomas Foley of Washington, House majority leader and convention
parliamentarian who is heir apparent to Speaker Jim Wright; Rep.
Bill Gray of Philadelphia, chairman of the House Budget Committee
and perhaps the country's most powerful black officeholder; and
Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, whose role in the Iran-Contra
hearings boosted his chances to succeed Robert Byrd as Senate
majority leader.
   Then, for democratic-minded Americans (with a small ``d'') who
still love a political dynasty, this convention had two young
Kennedys to offer: 35-year-old Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, Bobby
Kennedy's oldest son, a movie-star handsome figure roaming the
floor posing for pictures with awe-struck delegates; and his
cousin, John F. Kennedy Jr., the 27-year-old son of the late
president. The younger Kennedy, now a law student, drew cheers from
the delegates with his reference to his father: ``So many of you
came into public service because of him. In a very real sense,
because of you, he is still with us.''
   Another potential dynasty in the making passed along this stage:
the children of Jesse Jackson, including his oldest son, Jesse Jr.,
23, who proclaimed in a ringing voice, ``Those who say this is an
age of cynicism and despair are wrong. A new generation, my
generation, is coming. We have not given up the dream.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Democrats `Frantic Name-Callers,' Confirms Dole on Veep
List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARREN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush said Wednesday
that Democrats who have criticized him from their convention in
Atlanta are ``a bunch of frantic name-callers'' and confirmed that
former GOP rival Robert Dole of Kansas is on his list of
prospective running mates.
   The certain Republican presidential nominee, ending a four-day
fishing trip, said that he had given some thought to the selection
of a running mate and, when asked specifically if Dole were among
those considered, replied ``Sen. Dole would be on any list because
he's so widely respected.''
   The vice president said that, even though he and Dole engaged in
a bitter primary contest, ``that's all been laid to rest.''
   However, Bush said that he still had not narrowed any potential
list of running mates and had only decided upon a process that he
would follow. That process, Bush said, would be low-key.
   Asked about attacks on him by Democratic speakers in Atlanta,
Bush said that he had not been following the Democratic convention.
``I don't want to be cute with you, but I've been out of contact
for four days,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he did not intend to criticize Democrats during their
convention. ``I'm not good at being a slash-and-burn candidate,''
he said.
   When told by reporters about criticism of him from the
Democrats, Bush said, ``It might show a little desperation. Why
don't they run on what they're for? Why respond to a bunch of
frantic name-callers?''
   Told about caustic attacks on him by Democratic keynote speaker
Ann Richards, who told the convention in its opening session that
Bush was born ``with a silver foot in his mouth,'' the vice
president said only that he planned to carry Texas in the fall
election. Ms. Richards is Texas state treasurer.
   ``If you just go nasty, go ugly, that isn't an effective way to
do business,'' Bush said.
   The vice president spoke to reporters before addressing a
Captive Nations banquet in this Detroit suburb.
   In his speech to the largely Ukrainian audience, Bush delivered
a strongly anti-communist line. ``We will never cease to work and
pray for the freedom of our families, friends, our brothers all, in
nations held captive around the world,'' Bush said.
   He called upon Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev to free Eastern
European political prisoners who are being held in Soviet jails.
   Bush told reporters that his fishing trip with Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III had been a success. ``We stayed in the
same tent. We fished three days....We caught a lot of fish, went to
bed very early and had a minimal discussion of politics,'' Bush
said of his outing near Cody, Wyo. Baker is expected to become his
campaign manager.
   Told that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy had been particularly critical
of his role in the Iran-Contra affair, Bush told the news
conference, ``The good thing about the absolute wilderness is you
don't have to listen to Ted Kennedy.''
   The vice president said he wasn't troubled by the fact that his
campaigning Wednesday and Thursday during the final days of the
convention was a break in tradition.
   ``You tell me I shouldn't be in the wilderness. Now you say I
shouldn't be campaigning. What should I do?'' Bush said.
   Bush said he had no intention of waging an offensive campaign
during the Democrats' convention. ``I'm not going to rain on their
parade,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thailand Imposes Deadline For Resettlement Of Refugees</HEAD>

   Thailand said Wednesday it can no
longer bear the burden of its Cambodian refugees and threatened to
move thousands to border camps within range of shelling unless
Western nations resettle them by Aug. 31.
   The threat to move the refugees to the communist guerrilla-run
camps was announced by Suvit Suthanukul, the secretary-general of
the National Security Council. The refugees are now housed at the
Khao-I-Dang camp in Thailand.
   ``Resettlement countries have known all along that Thailand
cannot bear the refugee burden indefinitely, and we regard the Aug.
31 dateline as an acceptable time frame under which all must
quickly try to resettle the (Cambodians),'' he said.
   The Khao-I-Dang camp, about eight miles from the Cambodian
border, now shelters about 17,000 people who fled the war in
Cambodia. It is the only Thai camp from which the Cambodians can be
resettled.
   Suvit said that starting Sept. 1, authorities will move any
Cambodians who have not been resettled to the Site 2 camp, next to
the Cambodian border. Suvit said the movement would be completed by
the end of the year.
   Site 2, which houses 169,000 people, is the largest civilian
camp run by the Cambodian Marxist guerrillas.
   ``(The camp is) not far from the border and is still unsafe from
border shellings,'' Suvit said.
   Western officials have opposed moving the refugees out of
Khao-I-Dang, the only refugee camp for Cambodians not run by the
Khmer Rouge guerrillas. They say the new camp is too close to
fighting between the Cambodian rebels and Vietnamese troops
occupying their country.
   A Foreign Ministry official, Kobsak Chutikul, said that 4,000
Cambodians at Khao-I-Dang are likely to receive asylum by the Aug.
31 deadline. But many of the others have been rejected several
times by resettlement countries, he said.
   The United States has accepted the largest number of Cambodian
refugees.
   Kobsak said the United Nations is working on a program to find
other solutions for the Khao-I-Dang refugees whom Western countries
are unwilling to resettle.
   ``Their future is their return to their homeland. It's time to
puruse efforts in that direction,'' he said.

   Ralph Schuller was expecting a wonderful
birthday present Thursday: the birth of triplets by Caesarean
section.
   But his wife, Rickey, went into premature labor and gave birth
to the three boys on her own birthday _ in the same hospital where
she was born.
   ``I was accused of doing this on purpose,'' Mrs. Schuller said.
``It was a perfect delivery. Things just went very smoothly.''
   William, James and Michael, each weighing 3 to 4 pounds, were
born July 14 at Baptist Hospital.
   ``I just thought, `I'm not ready for this,''' Mrs. Schuller
said. ``Obviously, it was really exciting.''
   All three babies are doing well, and the two largest are
expected to leave the hospital in the next 10 days, said Gorge
Rojas, a neonatologist at Baptist's special care nursery.
   Mrs. Schuller entered the hospital in May with premature labor
signs and remained in bed until the babies were born. She left the
hospital Tuesday.
   Triplets occur once in every 7,000 births and often are the
result of fertility drugs, which the couple didn't take. The
Schullers knew since February they were to have triplets.
   The Schullers have one other child, a 2-year-old son.
   ``It's going to be wild, but it's going to be fun,'' Schuller
said.

   More than 500 physicians at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham have spent $2 million to go
into the hamburger business but they aren't setting up a new
practice.
   The University of Alabama Health Services Foundation, a
non-profit group of more than 500 doctors, bought a Wendy's Old
Fashioned Hamburgers franchise near the UAB campus because it wants
the land to build an outpatient clinic, said Dick Briggs Jr.,
acting president of the foundation.
   The group purchased the land in March for $1.6 million and the
hamburger franchise for $400,000. The foundation has kept the
restaurant operating because of a commitment not to have empty
buildings while it waits for construction of the $103.5 million
clinic to begin, Briggs said.
   ``But,'' he said, ``we don't have any long-range visions of
making our fortunes in the burger business.''
   The foundation likely will sell the franchise rights rather than
incorporating a Wendy's into the retail space that will be
available in the new clinic's parking deck. After all, he said,
``It may be hard to push cholesterol-lowering diets in our building
with a Wendy's next door.''

   Pe-Pe, father of the largest panda bear
family outside China, died on Wednesday of cancer, zoo officials
said. He was 13.
   ``He died at 9:30 a.m. of the sickness he had. Right now they
are performing the autopsy that will last four hours,'' Maru Nunez,
an administrative assistant at the Chapultepec Zoo, said in a phone
interview.
   A biopsy last month determined cancer in each of the panda's
armpits, and chemotherapy started earlier in July. The panda had
been losing weight.
   The Chinese government gave Pe-Pe and his mate, Ying-Ying, to
Mexico in September 1975. The prolific couple had seven
naturally-conceived cubs, of which four survived. The family of
giant pandas became one of the zoo's most popular attractions.
   Last week, Pe-Pe was down to 215 pounds from his normal weight
of 280 pounds, according to zoo director Maria Elena Hoyo.
   Ms. Hoyo said it was the first time chemotherapy treatments were
administered to a panda.
   The only two giant pandas on permanent display in the United
States are at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., a gift from
China.
   Pe-Pe puppets, candy and cartoons became some of the most
popular figures of Mexican children's entertainment.
   Pandas normally live about 20 years.
   Fewer than 1,000 of the bears, which are an endangered species,
are believed to be living in the wild, mostly in China.

   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Torrential rains sent rivers over
their banks in northern Basque country, trapping motorists in their
cars and leaving at least nine people dead and 10 missing on
Wednesday, reports said.
   In the hardest-hit area of Guipuzcoa province, heavy rain fell
for four hours Tuesday night, knocking out power lines and blocking
roads, Spanish National Radio said.
   Police divers recovered some bodies inside submerged cars, civil
defense officials said.
   In some areas of the three Basque provinces, hail the size of
chicken eggs accompanied by 100 mph winds destroyed crops, causing
at least $9 million in damage, the radio said.
   Health authorities warned residents to boil all water before
drinking it because supplies could have been contaminated in the
flooding.

   A laughing Gov. Bill Clements said
Wednesday he feels fine after suffering a minor stroke that
temporarily affected his vision and speech, adding he hoped to
leave the hospital Thursday.
   ``I feel great. I feel real good,'' Clements, 71, said in a
brief interview in his room at Seton Medical Center.
   Clements, who admitted himself to the hospital Tuesday night,
said doctors told him it appears a small blood clot formed and
passed into the upper left quarter of his brain, causing temporary
problems Monday night in his right eye and with his speech.
   Clements and his wife, Rita, said the problems developed while
he was reading after having watched the Democratic National
Convention on television.
   ``That Democratic Convention may have made this happen. I don't
know,'' the state's first Republican governor since Reconstruction
joked. ``The next morning, Tuesday, I felt fine.''
   Clements said he grew ``a little droopy,'' during the day
Tuesday and decided to see a doctor.
   Reggie Bashur, the governor's press secretary said Clements had
been undergoing tests since his hospitalization.
   ``The results are excellent, and I feel very fortunate that it
was just a temporary situation,'' the governor said.
   Mrs. Clements, seated beside her husband on a sofa during the
interview, said doctors told her such problems often last about 24
hours and clear up.
   Bashur said physicians would not comment until all test results
were known.
   Clements said the doctors hadn't yet told him what might have
caused the stroke. But he said he planned to resume a full schedule
and keep playing tennis.
   Bashur said Clements still hoped to be able to attend a prison
groundbreaking ceremony Friday in Amarillo. The State Board of
Corrections voted Wednesday to name the facility the William P.
Clements Jr. Unit.
   Clements was first elected in 1978. He lost to Democrat Mark
White in 1982 but came back to defeat White in the 1986 election.

Republican Sen. Bob Dole's ``acid-tongued barbs'' Wednesday,
singing ditties about his sharp wit at a caucus meeting.
   ``It sounds like they're talking about Ann Richards,'' joked
Dole when told of the Democrats' lyrics in Tokepa.
   Richards, the Texas treasurer, entertained Democratic delegates
at the national convention Monday night with stinging remarks about
Vice President George Bush.
   At the daily caucus meeting, the Kansas delegates wrote their
own lyrics to the tune of ``My Favorite Things'' from ``The Sound

   ``Razor-sharp hatchets and knives honed for stabbing,
   ``Acid-tongued barbs and the headlines they're grabbing,
   ``Partisan charges and mud that he slings,
   ``These are a few of Dole's favorite things.''
   While one Kansan played a kazoo, delegates were asked to join in
the sing-along. After a few stanzas, delegates sang at the top of
their voices and gave themselves a standing ovation at the end of
the session.

<HEAD>EPA Delays Develping Benzene Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Wednesday delayed developing regulations for more controls on the
leukemia-causing air pollutant benzene until it hears from the
public on what is an acceptable environmental risk.
   The approach the agency adopts for benzene, one of the most
widely used of all chemicals, is expected to set the standard for
agency rulings on acceptable levels of risk for dozens of other air
pollutants.
   ``One question is: Should we opt for additional controls that
may be expensive but only buy society little additional
reduction?'' EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said in a statement
announcing the delay.
   Currently, about 10 cases of leukemia occur in the general
population every three years as a result of leaks from plant
equipment and other exposure from making and using benzene. The
chemical is used in making gasoline, plastics, rubber, artificial
fibers and many other chemicals.
   Under the plans the EPA is considering, about one death every
other year would result from benzene exposure.
   Environmentalists have sought standards that, in effect, would
result in one death every 550 years. The EPA believes that such
stringent standards would force massive plant closings and lead to
the loss of thousands of jobs.
   At issue in the matter is whether environmental risk should
depend on where a person lives. Some analysts contend that society
has already answered that question by refusing to allow such
facilities as nuclear power plants to be built in urban areas but
allowing them in the countryside.
   With benzene, the EPA is trying to decide whether to rule that
nobody living near industrial sources should face a lifetime risk
greater than one in a million, as the environmentalists argue, or
whether larger risks to individuals should be allowed when few
people are exposed and the expected number of cancers is small.
   The agency asked for ``maximum public comment'' on the
sidetracked plan and three others. In order of increasing
stringency those others would:
   _Limit annual cases of leukemia to one in the entire population.
This would mean little cost to industry.
   _Limit the maximum likely risk to the most exposed individual to
one in 10,000, ignoring total cases.
   _Limit the maximum likely risk to one in a million. This, the
EPA said, could result in the closing of 131 chemical plants that
couldn't control leaks and the loss of 35,000 jobs, plus the
closing of 44 coke-oven byproduct recovery plants and the loss of
7,000 jobs.
   David Doniger, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said that he was ``gratified that the one-in-a-million
risk standard is under serious consideration,'' and was almost
certain that EPA had greatly overestimated the costs of compliance.
   He said it appeared the agency had not considered the ability of
industry to pass on cost increases in prices and also that EPA
assumed all plants would have to reduce emissions by the same
proportion as the dirtiest plants.
   He said the EPA also ignored the possibility that industry could
develop new technologies to control benzene emissions.
   The EPA's current benzene regulations, which were adopted in
1984, were challenged in court by Doniger. The agency had a court
deadline to make a proposal by Wednesday and a decision by December.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
said last year in a decision on another pollutant, vinyl chloride,
that the EPA must disregard all questions of costs in deciding
acceptable risks, but may consider costs and feasibility in
deciding the ``ample margin of safety'' called for by the law.
   The American Petroleum Institute said in a statement that the
new proposal offered ``a good opportunity to develop a workable
program in this area,'' and that it hoped the EPA would ``resist
the unreasonable demands of environmental groups'' to adopt
standards that are almost ``zero-risk.''

   A new, harder line shift in the
leadership of the Nicaraguan Contras and a resulting split with
their so-called ``Southern Front'' could be politically costly to
the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   The alliance between the Southern Front and the principal Contra
coalition known as the Nicaraguan Resistance has always been
fragile, marred by frequent disputes and an almost constant lack of
cooperation.
   But the announcement of a break in that alliance Tuesday night
by seven Southern Front field commanders highlighted anew the
growing turmoil within the Contra organization brought about by
last year's congressional decision to end U.S. aid.
   Ironically, the new Contra leadership disputes surfaced as the
rebels appeared to have gained their best hope in months of winning
renewed aid from a Congress concerned over recent repressive acts
by Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``It's hard to say who's best at shooting themselves in the
foot, the Sandinistas or the Contras,'' one western European
diplomat observed Wednesday. ``They seem to trade political miscues
as often as they trade bullets.''
   ``But the Contras are not likely to win any converts with this
political shakeup and their apparent drift to the right,'' added
the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It could give
some wavering congressmen, especially Democrats, second thoughts.''
   The diplomat referred to an election in the Dominican Republic
on Monday night that gave Enrique Bermudez, commander of the main
rebel army known as the Nicaraguan Democratic Front, a seat on the
Contras' seven-member political directorate.
   The General Assembly of the Nicaraguan Resistance also dumped
two of Bermudez's most outspoken critics, Alfonso Robelo and Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, leaving the military commander as the apparent
first among equals on the policy-making board.
   Bermudez, a former colonel in the National Guard of ousted
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, has long been a major point
of friction among Contra leaders, some of whom, like Robelo, are
former Sandinistas themselves and leery of a return to a
military-dominated government.
   At least five of the Southern Front field commanders who split
away from the Resistance because of Bermudez's election also are
former Sandinistas. They denounced his election as an attempt to
gain control of the Contra movement by ``the extreme right.''
   After being ousted from the directorate, Chamorro, a former
editor of the Nicaraguan opposition daily newspaper La Prensa,
accused the 50-member General Assembly of creating a ``military
hegemony.''
   ``This effort to confuse the military and the civilian
(leadership) brings back tragic memories from the past,'' Chamorro
said, in a clear reference to the 42-year rule of the Somoza family
that was ended by the Sandinistas in a popular revolution on July
19, 1979.
   The Southern Front has fought the Sandinista government along
the Nicaraguan-Costa Rican frontier since 1983, when it was first
formed under the name of the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance by
Eden Pastora, another former Sandinista guerrilla leader.
   Pastora, whose nom de guerre was Commander Zero, dropped out of
the fight in 1986, but many of his field commanders continued the
battle under the leadership of one of Pastora's former chief
lieutenants, Fernando ``El Negro'' Chamorro, and a new name, the
Opposition Bloc of the South.
   Chamorro also gave up the fight last year and returned to
Managua. But, again, many of the field commanders chose to fight
on, this time as the Southern Front under the leadership of Pedro
J. Lara, another former Sandinista known by his guerrilla name of
``Ganso.''
   From the beginning, the Southern Front guerrillas have received
but a fraction of the U.S. aid bestowed on the larger, better known
Contra army commanded by Bermudez and based in Honduras. Although
the Southern Front claims 2,700 combatants, most observers place
its strength at no more than 500 men and it has not been known to
have scored any significant military victories in recent years.

   Five people have pleaded innocent to charges they
smuggled 243 exotic birds from Cuba into the United States. The
case, says their attorney, was ``for the birds.''
   Ellis Rubin said his clients, Cuban immigrants who live in the
Miami area, were only moving the birds from Miami to Marathon for
the breeding season when they were arrested Easter Sunday.
   But U.S. Customs agents say correspondence on the ship _
including a letter from a woman asking to buy ``a girdle, size
medium, that I need very much to go out,'' showed the boat had been
in Cuba.
   They also found Cuban coins, a bill from a hotel and souvenirs
of Cuba aboard, but were puzzled as to how the boat got in and out
of the island nation.
   The birds included 193 Cuban melodius finches, 48 Cuban Amazon
parrots, one mustached parakeet and a scarlet macaw. The parrots
can be bought cheaply abroad and sold for $1,500 to $3,000 each in
the United States.
   Each defendant is charged with three felony counts, one of
conspiracy to violate the Lacy Act, and two counts each of
violation of the act itself.
   The defendants entered innocent pleas on Tuesday. They are free
on bond, and a trial was scheduled Sept. 12.

   Some see J.B. McNickles as a 6-year-old con
artist who assumed an alias, outfitted himself for the part and
eked out a six-day outing at an amusement park and Salvation Army
camp in trendy Malibu.
   Others say a somewhat-timid J.B. wanted to go camping and when
opportunity knocked, he quietly answered.
   Police, parents and the agencies involved say the whole incident
should never have happened. The boy's foster parents believed he
was missing and a massive search was launched.
   Odell Williams, J.B.'s foster father, dropped him off July 13 at
the Boys and Girls Club in Pacoima. He was not there a few hours
later when Edna Williams arrived to pick him up.
   While J.B. spent a day at Knott's Berry Farm and five days at
the Salvation Army camp, police conducted door-to-door searches,
posted hundreds of pictures of the boy and alerted other
jurisdictions about his disappearance.
   ``These various agencies need to be alerted that their checks
and balances didn't work and they got outsmarted by a 6-year-old,''
said police Detective Nancy Lyon.
   Leroy Chase, director of the Boys and Girls Club, said J.B.
boarded a van without the driver's notice.
   ``I never had been to camp before,'' J.B. explained. ``I wanted
to see what it was like.''
   The newly hired driver took the van full of kids to a Salvation
Army pickup point.
   ``He came from the Boys Club and we thought they knew their own
kids,'' said Maj. Joe Noland, a Salvation Army spokesman.
   ``I think there was one child who was a no-show, but we had his
application. We think this kid (J.B.) assumed the identity of that
child. We think he answered to that name.''
   J.B. claims: ``They asked me my name and I said J.B.''
   Mrs. Williams claims J.B. had no clothes, but Noland said he did.
   ``But what about the permission slips? I have had other (foster)
kids go to the camp and they needed parents' and doctors'
statements. There is no excuse for this,'' Mrs. Williams contends.
   The Salvation Army will try harder to make sure children match
their applications, Noland vowed.
   Chase emphasized that the Boys and Girls Club is not a child
care center but a youth facility.
   J.B. was returned home Monday by a neighbor who spotted him back
at the club.
   He and his foster parents told reporters he had a good time
although he got a little scared. He told others the trip was
nothing to write home about.
   The scenery, he said, ``was junky. Just some mountains.'' And he
didn't care for the food. ``I hated it. I didn't eat any of it. I
didn't even touch it.''
   When he learned about the extensive search launched for him, his
main question was: ``How much they spent looking for me? A hundred
thousand dollars, maybe?''

<HEAD>Thompson Says His Moderate Politics Wouldn't Disqualify Him as GOP
Veep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Republican Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson,
considered a possible vice presidential pick for George Bush, said
Wednesday that he doesn't expect such an offer and doesn't know
what he'd say if he got it.
   But Thompson said that his moderate politics wouldn't disqualify
him from a spot on the GOP ticket.
   ``I never thought moderation was a vice,'' Thompson said in an
interview during a quick visit to Atlanta to take part in a GOP
``truth squad'' session giving the Republican perspective on the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``I'm too moderate for some people, but I've never been told I'm
too moderate for George Bush,'' Thompson said. ``George Bush and I
agree on a lot of things.''
   He also said he thinks the country's voters average out to be
moderate, so two moderates on a ticket would be electable.
   When he was first elected in 1976 and again in 1978, the
Republican Thompson was endorsed by Jesse Jackson, the Chicago
Democrat who now is part of what Thompson branded a ``troika''
emerging as the 1988 Democratic ticket. He said that troika
includes presidential candidate Michael Dukakis; Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, Dukakis' vice-presidential choice, and Jackson.
   ``A lot of Democrats have endorsed me and voted for me,'' he
said. Bob Gibson, the Illinois State AFL-CIO president and a
delegate to this week's Democratic convention, has endorsed
Thompson in the last two of his four elections.
   A Democratic legislature blocked Thompson's bid for a 40 percent
income tax increase in Illinois. He said his fight for the tax
hike, which he termed ``modest,'' does not clash with Bush's
anti-tax talk.
   ``I don't think there's any discrepancy between supporting a
presidential candidate who says he doesn't want to raise taxes and
pushing a modest tax increase in your own state,'' Thompson said.
He said Bush believes in limiting federal taxes to give states more
``running room'' to fill their own financial needs.
   The four-term Illinois governor, who has held the post since
1977, has the longest tenure in the job in state history.
   Thompson, 52, said he does not expect Bush to ask him to run
because of the field of strong GOP candidates available, including
Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, and New York Rep. Jack Kemp.
   He said capability to be president, shared philosophy and
ability to carry out a strong campaign are should be key factors in
Bush's choice. Geography should be part of it, ``but it should be
the least part,'' he said.
   ``I don't really know what the job entails,'' he added. ``The
popular wisdom is that you're the No. 2 man,'' he said. But in the
real world, ``The president's staff is the No. 2 man. The cabinet
is the No. 3 man, and then the Congress is No. 4 man. ... Maybe
George Bush would rank his vice president higher than Dukakis
would. I don't know.''
   He said Bush is probably higher up the ladder ``on some issues''
in the Reagan administration.
   Thompson said he would have to weigh a change in lifestyle that
a vice presidency would bring to him and his family, including wife
Jayne and 9-year-old daughter Samantha.
   ``It would be in a different city, and being vice president
means you would be away probably more than as governor,'' said
Thompson, who lives with his family in a Chicago home and also has
living quarters in the governor's mansion in Springfield. ``That
would weigh heavily on me, I think.''

   The United States will mediate four-way talks
in Switzerland starting Aug. 2 aimed at working out a final
agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces from Angola and on
Namibian independence from South Africa, it was announced Wedneday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker made the
announcement after South Africa, Cuba and Angola _ the other
participants in the talks _ gave final endorsement to a statement
of principles governing future negotiations.
   ``This is an important step. We are not saying it is more than
that,'' Crocker told a news conference. ``There are a great many
hard and difficult compromises to be achieved.''
   The statement of principles was worked out on a tentative basis
last week during talks in New York. But it left unresolved the
thorny question of the timetables during which the withdrawals
would take place. This has emerged as the major area of
disagreement among the parties.
   Aside from the timetable issue, Crocker said the statement of
principles clears the way for the drafting of treaties, discussions
on verification of a final agreement and a process for the
disengagement of forces.
   The United States has been serving as mediator for the four-way
talks, which began in early May. The previous rounds were held in
London, Cairo and New York. The Switzerland talks will take place
in Geneva.
   The administration's involvement in the issue dates back to 1981
when Crocker began pursuing a settlement that would lead to the
withdrawal of Cuban and South African forces from Angola and South
African consent to independence for Namibia, Africa's last colony.
   The Cubans have sent up to 15,000 additional troops to Angola
since last fall but at the same time have shown a much greater
willingness to work out an agreement on a total withdrawal, a
senior official said, insisting on anonymity.
   The Cuban presence in Angola is believed to number between
47,500 and 50,000 forces. There are believed to be several thousand
South Africa forces in Angola supporting a U.S.-backed insurgency.
   The biggest remaining obstacle is a timetable for the mutual
troop withdrawals.
   Under a United Nations resolution, the independence process in
Namibia would be carried out over a one-year period once South
Africa consents to that step. That timetable is considered
non-negotiable.
   But South Africa, with U.S. backing, has said the South African
withdrawal will not take place unless Cuba agrees to withdraw its
forces simultaneously.
   In effect, that appears to mean Cuba would have to agree to
roughly a one-year withdrawal timetable or there is no agreement.
   As an opening bargaining position, Cuba and Angola have talked
of a four-year period for the Cuban pullback but both sides have
indicated flexibility on that point.

   A woman whose family abducted her from a
convent says she won't go back and is glad her family cared enough
about her to physically drag her away.
   ``I'm not going to go back to a convent,'' said Mary Susan
Greve, the former Sister Mary Cecelia. ``People are saying, `Live
your own life. Well, I am going to live my own life _ and I'm
excited about it.''
   Ms. Greve, 22, of Cincinnati, says she wants to finish college
to get the teaching degree she left half-completed when she joined
the St. Joseph Novitiate Convent in Roundtop, N.Y.
   Members of her family were long-time followers of the convent's
spiritual leader, the Rev. Clarence Kelly. However, they became
disturbed at his conservative practices, which were not sanctioned
by the Roman Catholic Church in Rome, and left his congregation.
   They tried to persuade Ms. Greve to leave.
   The family said it resorted to abducting her June 26 after Kelly
allegedly kept them from communicating with her.
   The church has said little since New York police dropped charges
against the family.
   Kelly has maintained Ms. Greve was brainwashed by her family
into believing the convent was a cult.
   Ms. Greve discussed her decision Tuesday during a taping of the
Phil Donahue Show. Kelly also appeared on the program.
   The traditional religious order follows the teachings of the
Roman Catholic Church prior to Vatican II, which gave bishops a
greater influence in church affairs, gave the laity a more active
part in the liturgy and liberalized church positions with regard to
non-Catholic and non-Christian faiths.

<TEXT>
   South Africa and Angola on Wednesday formally accepted an
agreement designed to withdraw foreign troops from Angola and grant
independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia. Here is a
glance at the disputed territories and a summary of the conflict:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANGOLA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY: 481,351 square miles, about twice the size of Texas,
on the southwest African coast.
   POPULATION: Estimated at 8 million, mostly in three ethnic
groups, the Ovimbundu, the Kimbundu, and the Bakongo. Mixed-race
and white Angolans comprise about 1 percent.
   ECONOMY: Has extensive petroleum and mineral resources, and rich
agricultural land. But the economy has been seriously disrupted by
civil war since independence.
   POLITICAL BACKGROUND: A former Portuguese colony, it gained
independence in 1975, after which a civil war continued between the
new Marxist government of the Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola (MPLA) and the rebels of UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NAMIBIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY: 320,827 square miles, about the size of Texas and
Oklahoma combined, on the southwest African coast between Angola
and South Africa.
   POPULATION: Estimated at 1.3 million, 88 percent black, with
whites and mixed-race comprising remainder.
   ECONOMY: Mining, ranching and fishing mostly controlled by
whites for foreign investors. Agriculture confined to the north.
Growth stymied since the 1970s by drought, low demand for minerals,
and uncertainty about political future.
   POLITICAL BACKGROUND: A German colony from 1884 to 1915, Namibia
was occupied and later administered by South Africa under a League
of Nations mandate. In 1946, South Africa refused a United Nations
request to place Namibia under a trusteeship agreement. In 1966,
the United Nations revoked South Africa's mandate. Since 1978,
South Africa has defied U.N. resolutions calling for Namibian
independence.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WARS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In 1966, the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO)
began guerrilla attacks on the South African administration in
Namibia from bases in neighboring Zambia. After black nationalists
of MPLA and UNITA drove Portugal out of Angola in 1975, SWAPO
established bases there.
   In Angola, UNITA contended the Marxist MPLA that took power with
Soviet help reneged on an agreement to share power, and UNITA has
been fighting since with the aid of South Africa and the United
States. The Marxist government has been backed by Soviet aid and
Cuban troops, now believed to number 50,000. South Africa escalated
its role in the war a year ago, moving troops into southern Angola
on a long-term basis.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AGREEMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The agreement calls for implementation of 1978 U.N. Security
Council Resolution 435, which provides for U.N.-mediated elections
in Namibia after South African withdrawal from the territory it has
ruled for 73 years.
   An important step in negotiations was agreement by Angola and
Cuba that independence for Namibia should be linked to the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.

<NOTE>Eds: 9th graf new with Bush reax. Picks up 9th graf pvs ... The

<TEXT>
   What's the best thing about a political
convention? Not the drama (certainly not this week). Not the food
(check back next month, after New Orleans). It's the shameless
rhetorical excess!
   And all of it this week directed at one man. The man with one
name. George.
   Poor George, that toothache of a man, that hear-nothing,
see-nothing, do-nothing vice president. A man, it has now been
said, ``too squeamish to bait his own hook.''
   In a spirit of generosity, the Democrats sometimes give George
more than one name. They give him the four he was born with, as in
George Herbert Walker Bush ``of the Kennebunkport Bushes.''
   Bush is the target of this attention by virtue of the fact that
he is to be nominated next month by the Republicans to stand
against Michael Dukakis, a Democrat about whom not one humorous
thing has been said this week at his convention in Atlanta.
   Rhetorical excess is political mischief-making with a serious
design. A convention provides a four-day televised platform where a
party will lay its record before the public and present its hopes
and plans for the future. On the less idealistic side, the TV time
can also be used to instill public doubt in the opposition.
   So scorn has been heaped as high as an elephant's eye here in
Atlanta as a score of prominent Democrats have taken their best
shot at the man who, it has now been said, probably wears argyle
socks with his cowboy boots.
   Next month the Republicans get their chance to take on Dukakis,
but for now Bush will have to hope his spokeswoman was right when
she said (in reaction to the notion that George was ``born with a
silver foot'' in his mouth): ``I don't think nastiness ever plays
very well.''
   Bush emerged from the Wyoming wilderness Wednesday and was
quickly asked about the Democratic criticism. ``It might show a
little desperation,'' he said. ``Why don't they run on what they're
for? Why (should I) respond to a bunch of frantic name-callers?''
   The Democrats are poking at Bush's vulnerabilities not so much
with nastiness as with sarcasm and ridicule.
   It began Monday night with the keynote speech, by the
sharp-tongued Texas State Treasurer, Ann Richards.
   ``For eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the
slightest interest in anything we care about,'' she said. ``And now
that he's after a job he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbus
discovering America. He's found child care. He's found education.''
   On Tuesday, Rep. Tony Coelho of California got things started,
followed in prime time by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and
Texas agriculture commissioner Jim Hightower.
   ``I know it's not fair to criticize the vice president behind
his back,'' Coelho said, then proceeded to do just that. ``He's
fishing in Wyoming, all alone, except for Jim Baker.'' The treasury
secretary is there, Coelho alleged, ``in case George is too
squeamish to bait his own hook.''
   Then Coelho began the ``where was George?'' routine that pokes
at Bush's lack of identity in Reagan administration matters.
   ``When we sold arms to the Ayatollah,'' he asked, ``Where was
George Bush?
   ``When Edwin Meese mocked the values we teach our kids, where
was Goerge Bush?''
   ``... Fact is, for eight years, nobody knows where George
Herbert Hoover Walker Bush has been. He's been silent. Invisible.
Missing. AWOL. Gone. Vanished.''
   Kennedy made the chant a prime-time highlight.
   ``The vice president says he wasn't there, or can't recall, or
never heard as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms to
Iran. So when the monumental mistake was made, I think it's fair to
ask, `where was George?'
   ``The vice president says he wasn't there, or can't remember, or
didn't comprehend the intelligence report on General Noreiga,'' he
said. ``...So when that report was being prepared and discussed, I
think it's fair to ask, `Where was George?'''
   And so on, until the crowd began answering for him, and then
repeated the chant without provocation: ``Where was George?''
   For anti-Bush one-liners, you had to like the speech by
Hightower, a populist who likes to make fun of rich people.
   After calling Bush ``a toothache of a man,'' he added, ``His is
an upper-class world in which wealth is given to you at birth. He
is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.''
   All that before the convention was half over. Next month will
come Bush's time for revenge.

   Israeli defense officials warned on Wednesday
of the potential threat to Israel of an Iraqi army left idle after
peace with Iran, but said the danger was not immediate.
   ``If there is an eastern front of Syria, Iraq and Jordan, with
the assistance of Saudi Arabia, the armored force facing Israel
will be equal to the number of tanks of all NATO countries,''
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said on Israel radio.
   He noted that Iraq has participated in every Arab war against
Israel, but said the danger of a new attack was not imminent
because it probably would take another year or two for the Persian
Gulf combatants to disentangle.
   Rabin also said that, if Arab leaders tried to use missiles
equipped with chemical warheads against Israel, ``they will get it
back hundredfold and more.'' Iraq and Syria are known to have
chemical weapons.
   Israeli defense officials said the size of Iraq's military
forces had grown from 300,000 troops to 1.1 million since the war
began in September 1980, the number of army divisions from 12 to 54
and the armored strength from 4,000 tanks to 6,000, Israel radio
reported, without identifying the officials.
   It quoted them as saying Iraq has about 560 jet fighters capable
of flying long-distance missions.

   Moslem pilgrims in the Saudi Arabian city
of Mecca on Wednesday shouted ``Death!'' to the United States, the
Soviet Union and Israel, Tehran Radio reported.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the demonstration was ``in
response to the call by Imam Khomeini.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is the religious and revolutionary
leader of Iran.
   Tehran Radio gave no source or further details in its report,
which was not confirmed from other sources.
   The radio said the demonstration was carried out by ``Moslem
pilgrims in the midst of Saudi security and police forces and close
to the house of God,'' a reference to the Kaaba, Islam's holiest
shrine in central Mecca.
   Saudi security forces have been on high alert to prevent
incidents such as last year's riot, following an anti-American,
anti-Saudi demonstration by fanatical Iranian pilgrims in which 402
persons died, most of them Iranians.
   Saudi Arabia set a limit this year of one pilgrim per thousand
population for each country. Iran is boycotting the pilgrimage in
protest while continuing anti-Saudi invective, calling the Saudi
royal family a U.S. ``lackey'' and not fit to be custodian of the
Moslem holy places.
   Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel Aziz said a small
number of Iranians came for the pilgrimage among about 750,000
Moslems from all over the world.
   The prince said in an interview published Wednesday that Iran
might take advantage of Shiite Moslems from other lands. Shiites
are the majority sect in Iran, but a minority in the Moslem world.
   Saudi security forces ``are vigilant and ready to confront any
Iranian plots,'' he said.

   Former Mayor Mike ``Mad Dog'' Roark
walked out of federal prison Wednesday after serving five months of
a cocaine possession sentence.
   Roark, 42, nicknamed for his flamboyant exploits as a
prosecutor, was whisked past reporters and photographers shortly
before 8 a.m. at the Federal Correctional Institute in Petersburg,
Va.
   Warden J.J. Clark said Roark refued to sign forms that would
have allowed him to be interviewed and prison officials to comment.
   A federal grand jury indicted Roark last July on 27
cocaine-related counts and three obstruction of justice counts.
   The one-time assistant U.S. attorney and Kanawha County
prosecutor pleaded guilty to six counts of cocaine possession Nov.
17 as part of a plea bargain and resigned as mayor Nov. 24, seven
months after he was elected to a second four-year term.
   He was sentenced to 179 days in prison and fined $5,000.
   Roark entered prison Feb. 12 and was scheduled for release Aug.
8. He was a model inmate, which enabled the early release, a prison
official said.
   ``Obviously, he's presented no problems to us,'' Clark said,
adding that Roark worked as a clerk in the prison's education
department.
   Roark is to meet Aug. 1 with the State Bar Association, which is
trying to revoke his license to practice law.
   Roark earned the nickname ``Mad Dog'' for various reasons,
including an incident in which he donned a camouflage jacket and
sidearm for a drug raid.

<HEAD>Cuomo: No Easy Win For Dukakis In New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday, just
hours before Michael Dukakis' nomination, that it won't be easy for
the Massachusetts governor to carry the Empire state in November.
   ``We must win New York or we can't win the presidency and people
are taking New York for granted,'' Cuomo said during an impromtu
news conference as he arrived at The Omni convention hall. ``I
don't think it'll be easy. I think we'll win, but it won't be
easy.''
   Reminded that he had been predicting a national landslide for
Dukakis and had previously said Dukakis would have big wins in
every region of the country, Cuomo insisted Wednesday that he
wasn't changing his tune.
   ``I think he's going to win a landslide nationally, but that's
not going to be easy either. You have to work for landslides,''
said Cuomo, who defined a landslide as more than 52 percent.
   Meanwhile, top aides to the New York governor said they would
begin discussions soon after the convention ended with Hulbert
James, Jesse Jackson's New York campaign manager, to work out what
role the Jackson forces would play in the campaign for the state's
36 electoral votes.
   Andrew Cuomo, the governor's son and chief political adviser,
also said that, unlike 1984, when the Cuomo camp had almost total
control over the New York campaign, the 1988 Dukakis effort would
be controlled more by the Dukakis camp.
   ``It's their campaign. It's their decisions,'' said Andrew
Cuomo. ``They are running the campaign. We'll help.''
   The elder Cuomo said he would do whatever he could for Dukakis
in New York and elsewhere ``consistent with what I do as governor,
and we're very busy, as everybody knows.''
   Cuomo hoped to meet later Wednesday with both Dukakis and
Jackson. Neither could find time to sit down with the New York
governor on Monday.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner Says Alcohol in Blood of Four Children in Church
Bus Wreck</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four children who were among 27 people
killed in a church bus crash had alcohol in the blood, the state
medical examiner said, but some survivors of the accident sharply
disputed that contention.
   ``I don't think it's a contributing factor at all'' in the
youths' inability to escape the burning vehicle, medical examiner
Dr. George Nichols told the Lexington Herald-Leader of the alcohol
finding.
   Neither the names of the four children nor the blood-alcohol
levels were available. Full autopsy results on all victims of the
May 14 crash were to be released Friday. The medical examiner has
said previously that all 27 died of smoke inhalation.
   The Radcliff First Assembly of God bus, returning to Hardin
County with 67 passengers after an outing at Kings Island amusement
park near Cincinnati, burst into flames after colliding head-on
with a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 near
Carrollton.
   All but two of the 24 young people killed in the crash were 15
or younger. Three adults, including the driver, also died.
   Police said the driver of the pickup, Larry W. Mahoney, was
drunk. Mahoney, 35, has pleaded innocent to 27 counts of capital
murder.
   In another development, the law firm that negotiated most of the
out-of-court settlements resulting from the crash apparently will
receive a $4.5 million fee, The (Louisville) Courier-Journal
reported Wednesay.
   The firm negotiated payments totaling $35.9 million for 60
families, The Courier-Journal said. Ford Motor Co., one of the bus'
principal manufacturers, has reached settlements with 65 of the 67
families involved in the crash.
   Some of the crash survivors disputed the medical findings.
   ``Nobody was drinking,'' said Jamie Hardesty. ``I don't think
it's true. John Pearman wouldn't let nothing like that on the bus.''
   Pearman, an associate pastor of the Radcliff First Assembly of
God and the bus driver, was among the victims.
   Sandra Glover, 17, another survivor, said three coolers aboard
the bus contained only soft drinks. She said Nichols' contention
was going to hurt the church.
   ``All that stuff about Larry Mahoney drinking and driving, and
now they're going to say, `The kids were doing it, too,''' she
said. ``John Pearman told us when we left that morning that there
was to be no alcohol, either on the bus or at the park.''
   Bill Mefford, manager of marketing and communications for Kings
Island, said the park sells beer to those 21 and older, but only
after a check of identification.
   ``We absolutely check IDs,'' Mefford said. ``We have some
complaints because we card everybody, even those as old as 60.''

<HEAD>Despite Drought, Regional Differences May Result in Record Farmer
Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although battered by drought, farmers
collectively across the nation may wind up with about as much cash
income in 1988 as last year when income was at a record level, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   ``Although little overall change is expected in income, regional
disruptions are arising because income differs sharply among
individual farmers from what it would have been with normal
weather,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
   But the smaller, drought-withered crops and a sharp decrease in
grain held in storage have boosted commodity prices ``usually by
more than enough to offset reduced yields,'' the agency said in its
report.
   ``This year's cash receipts (from sales) are up because of
higher crop values and sales from past years' crops in storage at
drought-increased prices,'' it said. ``However, farmers hit hardest
by the weather are expected to have much lower receipts.''
   The economic report said that the rise in commodity prices may
boost farmers' gross cash income nationally to a range of $162
billion to $167 billion in 1988, about $4 billion higher than
projected last month. Nationally, the gross was about $159 billion
in 1987.
   Gross cash income includes proceeds from marketing and direct
government payments. When cash expenses are deducted, what is left
is called net cash income, which was projected at $53 billion to
$59 billion for 1988, compared with the record of $56 billion in
1987.
   The agency also computes ``net farm income'' to include
allowances for the value of goods consumed at home, dwellings and
changes in the value of inventories held by farmers.
   On that basis, this year's net farm income could be in the range
of $40 billion to $45 billion, down from $42 billion to $48 billion
forecast in June. Net farm income in 1987 was $46 billion.
   Officials said the decline _ to $1 billion to $6 billion from
last year _ reflects the drop in 1988 production.
   Direct government payments to farmers, including ``deficiency''
payments to crop producers, are expected to decline this year to a
range of $11 billion to $13 billion, from a record of $17 billion
in 1987, said economist Richard Kodl. The higher market prices are
trimming the subsidies.
   But the biggest reduction will come in calendar 1989, Kodl said.
That is because most of the payments for 1988 crops will go to
farmers next year, after the USDA does the bookkeeping on how much
will be due.

   Fidel Castro personally revoked the visa of Rep.
Dan Mica, D-Fla., just hours before he was to fly to Havana to
inspect the U.S. diplomatic post there for security breaches, the
congressman charged Wednesday.
   ``I'm convinced this had to be personally revoked by Castro _ no
desk officer would do this,'' said Mica, a candidate for his
party's nomination to fill the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by
Lawton Chiles.
   Mica, who is also chairman of the House subcommittee charged
with overseeing safety and security at U.S. embassies abroad, said
that he had never been denied entry to a country, including
communist countries.
   ``This is a major violation of diplomatic protocol,'' Mica said.
He said that he and a ``crack team'' of congressional and U.S.
State Department officials were specialists in securing U.S.
diplomatic posts.
   The visas for the group were issued on July 14, he said. Cuban
officials said that they were revoked to protest an American
diplomat's guest list for a party in Havana on July 15.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said that Cuba's
foreign minister, Isodoro Malmierca, called ``non-establishment''
Cubans who attended the party ``unacceptable.'' Human rights
activists were among the party guests, she said.
   ``The U.S. is protesting this incident, which was a great
discourtesy to a congressman and an example of Cuban government
intimidation of human rights activists,'' she said.
   Mica said he had planned to investigate charges that security at
the oceanfront U.S. post in Havana had been compromised. He said
the growing number of Cuban employees _ 102 versus 26 Americans _
was a potential threat to security.
   ``We have to maintain a large support staff there. We're
wondering if it's too big _ and who is on it,'' said Robert K.
Boyer, a senior staff member of the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs.
   Mica said that he would also investigate allegations that U.S.
Marines assigned to guard the post may have fraternized with Cuban
women, compromising security.
   A third concern is that an unspecified number of Cubans
reporting to U.S. intelligence officials may be double agents, and
have been for up to 20 years, Mica said.
   The congressman from Lake Worth insisted he had planned to
maintain a low profile in Cuba and had not sought media coverage of
the trip until it was blocked.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is trying to work
out a cooperative approach with the Soviet Union in the struggle
against drug traffickers, the State Department said Wednesday.
   The discussions began in Moscow in April and ``both sides are
currently evaluating potential productive areas for future
cooperative activity,'' Phyllis Oakley, a department spokeswoman,
said.
   These include Soviet proposals to swap information on techniques
for intercepting drug shipments and ways of identifying the source
of narcotics through their ``signature,'' Catherine Shaw, a public
information officer, said.
   ``The proposals are very, very modest,'' Ms. Shaw said, and
reflect an admission, but not the first, by the Soviets that they
also have a drug problem.
   John C. Lawn, the U.S. drug enforcement administrator, will send
a delegate to Moscow for further discussions to pave the way for
more formal talks in Washington later in the year, the U.S.
official said.
   ``We are evaluating various proposals and we simply do not have
any definitive word on what those proposals are right now,'' Mrs.
Oakley said.
   The U.S. official said cooperation in the fight against
narcotics was ``a potentially fruitful area for improved bilateral
cooperation.''

<HEAD>Tribal Officials Ignore Commission Subpoenas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navajo judges and lawyers boycotted a
U.S. Civil Rights Commission hearing Wednesday, contending
commission subpoenas illegally infringed on tribal sovereignty.
   A commission subcommittee is holding hearings to determine if
federal courts should be allowed to enforce civil rights laws on
Indian reservations. Wednesday's session was to examine what impact
a dispute between the current and former heads of the tribe is
having on the Navajo judiciary.
   The commission lacked authority to even inquire about tribal
court enforcement of the federal Indian Civil Rights Act because a
1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision gives tribal courts final say on
the law, said David Nash, an attorney for the tribe.
   The ``subpoenas demonstrate an appalling disregard for the
integrity of the Navajo tribal court system'' and attorney-client
privilege, Navajo Attorney General Michael Upshaw added in a
written submission.
   ``We resent the Commission's intrusion into a tribal judicial
proceeding and its attempt to require us to re-litigate the case
before the Commission, particularly while it is pending before the
Navajo courts,'' he said.
   Commission Chairman William Allen said a decision would be made
later on how to enforce the subpoenas.
   The dispute began earlier this year when tribal Chairman Peter
MacDonald sought control over the Navajo Education and Scholarship
Foundation, which former Chairman Peterson Zah believed he had been
given authority over.
   Zah, locked out of his office, got a tribal judge to issue an
order barring his eviction. The tribe got another judge, and police
shut down the entire building.
   Brian Miller, the commission's deputy general counsel, said his
agency's interest was ``not one (of) merits and not one of who is
right and who is wrong but one of due process and civil rights.''
   Allen said the subcommittee was holding the hearings because the
Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that tribal enforcement of the Indian
Civil Rights Act was not subject to federal court review.
   ``Commission staff has received allegations that the
independence of the judiciary of the Navajo Nation has been
recently threatened,'' he said.
   ``Part of the court's reasoning was that `tribal forums are
available to vindicate rights created by the ICRA,''' Allen said.
``Put simply, the question this subcommittee has been examining is
whether the court's assumption is true.''
   The commission also discussed adoption cases involving Indian
children.
   Relatives, attorneys, social workers and would-be adoptive
parents in cases involving the Navajo and White Mountain Apache
tribes were called to testify.
   The Indian Child Welfare Act passed by Congress gives tribes
exclusive control over adoption in cases where the mother is living
on the reservation.
   The law stemmed from repeated complaints from tribal members
that non-Indian courts were too quick to allow non-Indians to adopt
an Indian child.
   But the commission wanted to see whether the rights given to the
tribe as a whole infringed on the rights of the individual parties.
   One case gained national attention recently when Rick and Cheryl
Pitts, a San Jose, Calif., couple, obtained a baby from a Navajo
woman outside the reservation.
   The tribal court demanded jurisdiction from a California court.

<HEAD>Zia Sets Elections for November; Opponents Blast Delay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq
announced on Wednesday that elections will be held on Nov. 16, but
the opposition demanded August elections and called his action a
delaying tactic and unconstitutional.
   Gen. Zia said in an address to the Senate that the elections
will be for both the National Assembly and for the four state
legislatures of Punjab, Sind, Baluchistan, and the North West
Frontier.
   His foes insisted that under Pakistan's Constitution, polling
must take place by Aug. 27, when a 90-day deadline expires
following Zia's May 29 dissolution of the National Assembly.
   The assembly and the Senate comprise the federal legislature.
   Zia said election arrangements cannot be completed before
November.
   Benazir Bhutto, head of the strongest opposition group, the
Pakistan's People's Party, called Zia's decision ``yet another
attempt to subvert the constitution and the political process of
transfer of power.''
   She said Zia would never have announced any poll date had it not
been for the opposition.
   Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown as prime
minister by Zia in a 1977 military coup and was hanged in 1979
after conviction on a conspiracy to murder charge in a
controversial trial.
   Zia dismissed Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo, the National
Assembly and four state legislatures in May, accusing them of
corruption, incompetence, and failure to ``Islamize'' Pakistan and
prevent a breakdown of law and order.
   Junejo denied the charges and accused Zia of violating the
constitution by ``arbitrarily dissolving the assembly and
disrupting a democratic system which was operating smoothly.''
   The former premier told a news conference Wednesday, ``The
constitution clearly demands elections within 90 days after the
dissolution of the assembly. We need elections straight away. Nov.
16 is very late.''
   He said his Pakistan Moslem League Party had ``already
established a committee of constitutional experts to examine ...
(whether to challenge the delay in court) as well as the legality
of disolving the assembly.''
   Former Air Marshal Asghar Khan, president of the centrist
Tehril-e-Istiklal (Movement for Solidarity), said:
   ``We wanted these elections to be held within 90 days. His
(Zia's) credibility is already low. What is going to happen between
now and November, and whether polls will, in fact take place, no
one knows.''

   Here are some quotes from Wednesday's activities
at the Democratic National Convention.
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, speaking to a reception in honor of his wife of
25 years, Kitty: ``I'm a very lucky guy.'' His only regret, he
said, was that, ``When I was a senior at Brookline High School
nobody told me about a freshman named Kitty Dickson. If they had
this might all have started even earlier.''
   
   DUKAKIS, recalling the words he told his wife when he arrived
Sunday in Atlanta: ``This is a kick. ... I think it's for real, I
mean it's happening.''
   
   ANN RICHARDS, the Texas state treasurer who delivered the
keynote speech to the convention Monday night, speaking to a
fund-raising network for women Democratic candidates: ``Lloyd
Bentsen has been a friend to women in Texas. ... I think he gives
us a real shot at this election in November.''
   
   KITTY DUKAKIS, talking to a group of children and recalling her
26-year addiction to amphetamines: ``I couldn't stop using them and
I became addicted. The words I want to say to you are, `Don't
start.'''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, on having his campaign continue through the roll
call for nomination for president: ``It will be a great feeling
personally. But really, it's my name put into nomination for the
people who voted for me, but also for the people who made it
possible. ... It's fulfilling the prayers of people who fought
hard. It's a steppingstone for progress for the future.''
   
   DUKAKIS, telephoned Jackson to commend him on his address to the
Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night and said, ``I
thought the speech was terrific.''
   
   Illinois Gov. JAMES THOMPSON, part of the Republican ``truth
squad'' sent to Atlanta to comment on the proceedings of the
Democrats: ``Michael Dukakis has tied Jesse Jackson to this ticket
rather firmly. ... With Bentsen whispering in one ear and Jackson
whispering in his other ear, who is Dukakis going to listen to? ...
I think that's the question the American people need to have
answered.''
   
   Vice President GEORGE BUSH, the certain Republican nominee,
commenting in Warren, Mich. on the criticism of him from the
Democrats: ``It might show a little desperation. Why don't they run
on what they're for? Why respond to a bunch of frantic
name-callers?''

   The University of Oklahoma regents voted
Wednesday to change the name of a building dedicated to a former
grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, according to a group that fought
for the change.
   The regents voted 6-1 to remove the name DeBarr Hall from the
university's chemistry building, the group said. The late Edwin
DeBarr was one of the first four faculty members of the university,
and a Klan leader.
   Debra Rives, chairwoman of the Norman chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society, said she was ``thrilled'' the regents approved
the change, which her 1960s-rooted organization reorganized to
fight for.
   ``The message that we hope it gives is that OU is trying very
hard to erase the symbols of racism that have existed on this
campus for a number of years,'' Rives said.
   Student government groups, the chemistry faculty and the Faculty
Senate all urged the regents to change the name.

<TEXT>
   American pop star Bruce Springsteen thrilled about
160,000 cheering fans at a concert in East Berlin, and the
communist press on Wednesday hailed him as a friend of the working
class.
   It was the largest gathering of rock fans that ever in East
Germany.
   ``I am not here to support or oppose whatever government,''
Springsteen told the crowd during the Tuesday night concert in East
Berlin. ``I came here to play rock 'n' roll.''
   But he added, ``I hope that some day all the barriers (between
East and West) will be torn down.''
   Fireworks streaked through the sky during Springsteen's concert,
and his fans sang along to ``Born in the USA,'' ``Dancing in the
Dark,'' ``I'm On Fire,'' and other hits.
   Hundreds of people in the audience waved handmade American flags
during the four-hour concert, which was staged at a bicycle-racing
track in the East German district of Weissensee.
   Springsteen had asked East German officials if he could play in
the communist country as a part of his ``Tunnel of Love Express''
world tour, and they complied.
   The East German news media portrayed the American singer as
someone who fights against social injustices and as a friend of
workers.
   ``He attacks social wrongs and injustices in his homeland,''
wrote Neues Deutschland, the official newspaper of the East German
Communist Party.
   ``He wants to give hope to youths who are threatened with
joblessness in the capitalist world,'' the newspaper said.
   Fans came from all over the country to see Springsteen, waving
banners announcing that they were from Leipzig, Magdeburg, Dresden
and other places in East Germany.
   ``We Love You, Boss,'' said one of the banners.
   A concert ticket cost about $10.
   Springsteen said to his appreciative East German fans at the end
of the concert, ``I hope to play here again real soon.''

   Showers fell the length of a slow-moving cold front that
stretched from southern New England to north of the Ohio Valley and
southwest into Texas Wednesday, while the Far West continued to
bake in three-digit temperatures.
   The rain fell in torrents in some places. In northeast Kentucky,
1.20 inches of rain fell in just 15 minutes in the afternoon. Two
inches fell in four hours near Washington, Pa. Lamar, Texas,
reported 3.64 inches of rain during the morning, while Houston
logged up to 2 inches.
   Scott Air Force Base near Belleville, Ill.; Langley Air Force
Base near Hampton, Va.; Cincinnati; Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.;
and Huntington, W.Va., all received more than an inch of rain in
the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   A pocket of intense thunderstorms formed by an upper-level low
pressure system moved over Minnesota and into western Wisconsin
Wednesday, bringing heavy rain and hail over the Twin Cities.
Roseville, Minn., north of St. Paul, reported 2- to 3-inch drifts
of marble-size hail.
   Flash flood watches were issued for parts of southeast and
south-central New Mexico. Northeast Arkansas and southeast Missouri
got widespread rain for a second day Wednesday. The Cache River was
expected to spill over its banks near Patterson, Ark., causing
minor lowland flooding.
   West of the Rockies, readings were expected to climb to between
115 and 120 degrees in northern parts of the Sacramento Valley.
Temperatures topped 100 degrees over interior California and the
desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61
degrees at Fort Ord to 108 degrees at Redding, both in California.
The nation's low Wednesday morning was 34 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to
continue to push slowly eastward and southward, extending from
northern Arizona and the southern Rockies across central and
southern Texas, the lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio valleys
to the East Coast. The showers should be heaviest from Mississippi
and Tennessee across the Appalachians to the mid- and northern
Atlantic states.
   Highs should be in the 70s and 80s in most of the nation from
the Rockies to the East Coast, rising into the 90s along the
southern Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast. Readings should range into
the 90s and to 105 degrees west of the Rockies, and to 115 in
interior California and the desert Southwest.

   South Africa, Angola and Cuba
formally accepted an agreement Wednesday that is intended to get
foreign troops out of Angola and grant independence to South-West
Africa.
   ``There is a general consensus that no one should come out a
loser. Everyone can come out winners if we can achieve peace in the
region,'' Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha told a news conference.
   A similar announcement accepting the 14-point Principles for a
Peaceful Settlement in Southwestern Africa was made in Luanda,
Angola. The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico
City, said Fidel Castro's government had accepted it.
   The official Angolan news agency Angop carried a transcript in
Portuguese of the government statement.
   Roland Darroll of the South African Foreign Ministry said the
next round of talks will be held Aug. 2-4 in Geneva.
   ``We offered South Africa as the next venue, and we are still
offering for the following talks because we believe Africa is the
appropriate place to hold talks on an African problem, but we
accepted the Swiss offer,'' he said.
   In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker
said: ``This is an important step. We are not saying it is more
than that. There are a great many hard and difficult compromises to
be achieved.''
   The United States mediates the talks, which began in May and led
to agreement in principle last week in New York. Other rounds were
held in London and Cairo, with Angolan-South African talks in
Brazzaville, Congo.
   Major obstacles remain to implementation of the peace plan,
which says nothing of timetables for Cuban and South African troop
withdrawal from Angola, cutoffs of Soviet, U.S. and South African
military aid to the warring parties, or settlement of the civil war.
   ``Further agreements are envisaged in these principles,'' Botha
said. ``We have traveled a long distance to get to this stage but
we are only at the foot of the mountain. The road ahead is steep,
full of potholes and dangerous curves.''
   The principles call for implementation of 1978 U.N. Security
Council Resolution 435, which provides for U.N.-mediated elections
in South-West Africa after South African withdrawal from the
territory it has ruled for 73 years.
   An important step in the negotiating process was agreement by
Angola and Cuba that independence for South-West Africa, also
called Namibia, should be linked to the withdrawal of an estimated
50,000 Cubans from neighboring Angola.
   The principles call for a movement of an estimated 15,000 Cubans
northward from the border area where they have recently deployed
and battled with South African troops inside Angola.
   A major obstacle to implementation of the peace plan is the
absence of agreement on timetables for the withdrawals.
   South Africa and the United States want the Cuban withdrawal
from Angola to dovetail with the South African withdrawal from
Namibia, anticipated at one year under the U.N. resolution. Cuba
and Angola have said it would take four years for the Cubans to
leave.
   Also not addressed in the principles is the status of the
indigenous warring parties and guerrilla organizations. South
African troops have fought inside Angola in support of the
anti-Marxist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
or UNITA, also aided by U.S. weapons and supplies.
   South Africa says Angola allows the African National Congress,
which is waging a sabotage campaign against white rule in South
Africa, to maintain guerrilla training bases in Angola.
   Also, the military wing of the South-West African People's
Organization, or SWAPO, has its bases in southern Angola, where
they have recently been protected by the Cuban forces from
cross-border retaliation for bombings and attacks on South African
forces in Namibia.
   America, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Cuba, and several
Eastern Bloc nations give military aid to one side or the other in
the conflicts and that issue has also not been addressed.
   ``Just as this is not the stage to approach Angola on the issue
of their support to the ANC, this is also not the stage to address
the question of our aid to UNITA,'' Botha said.
   Negotiators have indicated that the dispute between the Luanda
government and UNITA is regarded as an internal one for Angolans to
settle once the foreigners leave the country.
   No specific reference was made to when South Africa would pull
its estimated 3,000 troops out of Angola, and Botha refused to
comment on the question of a cease-fire or unilateral withdrawal.
``We believe it (the agreement) will lead to a lessening of
tensions,'' Botha said.
   Hidipo Hamutenya, information secretary for SWAPO, was
optimistic about the implications of the agreement.
   ``When all the elements are in place, we expect South Africa and
SWAPO to hold direct talks and reach a ceasefire agreement as a
first step towards the implementation of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 435,'' Hamutenya said in a cable interview from Luanda
with AIM, the Mozambican national news agency.
   Hamutenya said, ``It stands to reason that progress is being
made and the prospects for a comprehensive settlement of the
conflict in the southwestern corner of Africa are reasonably
bright.''
   The principles also call for: all states to recognize the
integrity and inviolability of borders; non-interference in the
affairs of other states; abstention from threats or use of force
against the territorial integrity or independence of other states;
responsibility of states not to allow their territory to be used
for acts of war or agression against another.

<HEAD>Sentencing Delayed in Former Highway Patrolman's Murder Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sentencing of a former state highway patrolman
convicted of a motorist's murder was delayed Wednesday to allow the
defense to appeal one aspect of the case, but the judge refused to
grant a new trial.
   Superior Court Judge Richard Huffman postponed until Aug. 3 the
sentencing of Craig Peyer, 38, who was convicted in his second
trial of first-degree murder in the strangulation of a San Diego
State University student.
   Peyer's first trial ended in a deadlocked jury in February.
   Huffman said the postponement gives the defense time to seek
appellate review of a ruling Monday in which he said a reporter
didn't have to answer questions about how he obtained results of
the defendant's lie-detector test.
   The judge rejected all other elements in a defense motion
seeking a new trial for the former California Highway Patrol
officer, as well as a motion to reduce the jury's first-degree
murder finding to second-degree murder.
   Huffman said he rejected the argument by defense attorneys
Robert Grimes and Diane Campbell that the killing may have been an
impulsive act.
   He said the evidence supported the jury's finding that the Dec.
27, 1986, strangulation of Cara Knott, 20, involved premeditation.
Knott was driving from Escondido to her El Cajon home when she was
stopped and directed down an isolated ramp of Interstate 15 and
then killed.
   ``Mr. Peyer had to get a rope,'' Huffman said. ``There's no
reason in this evidence to make me believe that he walked around
with a rope attached to his belt. He had to engage in a conscious
decision _ finding that rope _ and wrap it around that youngster's
neck.''
   As part of their motion for new trial, the attorneys claimed
Huffman erred in several evidentiary rulings involving the
exclusion of potential defense witnesses and the limiting of
testimony by other witnesses. But Huffman said all of his rulings
were justified.
   However, the judge admitted he shared the defense's concerns
about the publication of Peyer's lie-detector test. The test, which
is inadmissible as evidence, reportedly showed Peyer attempted
deception when questioned about Knott's death after his arrest.
   Grimes and Campbell argued the publication of the polygraph
information may have affected Peyer's right to a fair trial.
   The attorneys also said the information may have been leaked to
San Diego Union reporter Jim Okerblom by police or a member of the
prosecution.
   Huffman has said that if that proves to be the case, he would
have to consider granting Peyer a new trial or dismissing the
charge altogether on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct.
   Okerblom's story appeared in The Union during jury selection for
Peyer's second trial. It prompted unusually extensive jury
questioning.
   Okerblom was called to the witness stand Monday but cited
constitutional protections and the state's Shield Law in refusing
to answer questions about the polygraph material, mailed to the
Union anonymously.
   The Shield Law prohibits the state's judges from holding a
reporter in contempt for refusing to identify anonymous sources.
   Grimes said he would petition the 4th District Court of Appeal
to determine the applicability of the Shield Law in the Peyer case.

<HEAD>FCC Approves Sale Of Two RKO-Owned Broadcast Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission approved
the sale of two broadcast stations owned by RKO and took a major
step in resolving a legal dispute that has lasted more than two
decades.
   The FCC approved a settlement agreement calling for RKO, a
subsidiary of GenCorp. to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles and WHBQ-AM
radio in Memphis, Tenn.
   The Los Angeles television station is being sold to Walt Disney
Co., and 70 percent of the Memphis radio station is being sold to
Flinn Broadcasting Corp.
   ``The approval will put the stations in the hands of
indisputably qualified licensees and avoid countless years of
continued litigation before the FCC and the courts,'' the
commission said.
   GenCorp., RKO's parent company, two years ago announced its
desire to get out of the broadcasting business, but its attempt to
sell its stations have been locked in a legal dispute over whether
RKO actually should have the broadcast licenses involved.
   A legal battle dating back to 1965 revolves around the fitness
of RKO to operate the broadcast stations. The FCC in 1980 refused
to renew RKO's license for WNAC-TV in Boston, saying the company
was unqualified to run the station.
   Since then RKO's licenses in other cities have been under
challenge.
   In approving the proposed sale of the Los Angeles television
station and the Memphis radio station, the FCC said, ``The
commission concluded that strong public interest considerations
favored settling these two cases, which are part of the most
burdensome proceedings in the FCC's history.''
   Gen. Corp., which is based in Akron, Ohio, said in a statement
that it welcomed the FCC's decision and that it hoped it would
serve as a model in the sale of RKO's other broadcast stations.
   ``This marks a giant step toward a constructive resolution of 23
years of litigation involving the RKO licenses,'' said GenCorp
chairman A. William Reynolds.
   Under the agreement, RKO receives roughly two-thirds of the
revenue from the sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles and WHBQ radio in
Memphis with competing applicants receiving one-third.
   In the case of KHJ-TV, Walt Disney Co., will pay RKO $218.6
million and pay a competing license applicant, Fidelity Television
Inc., $105.4 million. Fidelity ultimately is to be merged into a
subsidiary of Disney.
   In the case of WHBQ in Memphis, Flinn Broadcasting will pay RKO
$525,000 and pay a competing license applicant, First City
Communications Inc., $225,000. First City will then assign the
license of WHBQ to Flinn.
   The same formula is hoped to be used in future FCC approval for
the disposal of 12 other RKO broadcast stations, said GenCorp.
spokesman Rip Tilden.
   Tilden said agreement already has been reached with buyers to
sell two radio stations in Boston (WRKO-AM and WROR-FM) and two
radio stations in the Washington DC area (WGMS-AM and FM) await FCC
approval.
   RKO's other broadcast holdings are a television station, WHBQ-TV
in Memphis, and seven radio stations in New York City (WOR-AM and
WRKS-FM), Los Angeles (KHJ-AM and KRTH-FM), San Francisco
(KFRC-AM), Chicago (WFYR-FM) and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., (WAXY-FM).

   Mobs destroyed shops and other buildings
late Wednesday in new violence in a southern city after weekend
riots killed one person and injured six others, official state
radio reported.
   The radio gave no casualities, arrests, or other details on the
latest rioting in Prome, about 180 miles north of Rangoon.
   The weekend rioting broke out after a teashop owner and customer
quarreled. The unrest died down Monday after Buddhist monks
appealed for calm.
   On Tuesday, state radio reported that 41 people arrested during
March 18 riots and packed into a prison van died during a two-hour
ride to jail. It said the victims were cremated March 19 and that
the government had delayed release of the news to avoid possible
spread of unrest.
   The victims died from tear-gas exposure and the long period
spent in the overcrowded prison van, the radio said.
   Home Minister U Min Goung took responsibility for the deaths and
resigned, according to the announcement.
   The 41 victims were among 71 people arrested during student
riots in Rangoon.

<HEAD>Justice Official Says Aquino May Allow U.S. Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino has the
right to allow U.S.nuclear weapons in the country despite a
constitutional provision against such arms, her justice secretary
said in an opinion released Wednesday.
   The legal opinion set the stage for a confrontation between Mrs.
Aquino and Filipino legislators, many of whom oppose the presence
of both nuclear weapons and U.S. military bases.
   In the 19-year-old war with rebels, authorities said at least 17
people were killed in the previous 48 hours in several clashes
across the archipelago.
   Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez said in a four-page opinion
the constitutional provision against nuclear weapons ``must be
viewed as an instrument, rather than an objective, in
treaty-making. If such a policy is not in keeping with the national
interest of the Philippines ... the president may defer from it.''
   The 1986 constitution, written by a commission Mrs. Aquino
appointed, says the nation, ``consistent with the national
interest, adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from nuclear
weapons in its territory.''
   Last month, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill banning
nuclear weapons. A similar bill is pending in the House of
Representatives.
   The United States refuses to confirm or deny whether keeping
such weapons at its six bases in the Philippines.
   In April, the United States and the Philippines began a review
of the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, whose current term expires in
1991.
   ``It is my opinion that the president of the Philippines may
negotiate a modification or extension of the military bases
agreement with the U.S., regardless of the provisions therein
pertaining to nuclear weapons,'' Ordonez said in his opinion.
   He presented it Tuesday to a closed meeting of a
legislative-executive panel advising Filipino negotiators in the
bases negotiations.
   His decision means Mrs. Aquino ultimately may have to decide
either to permit nuclear weapons in the face of growing opposition
or risk a confrontation with the United States.
   Washington is her government's major source of military and
economic aid. The United States provides $180 million annually in
economic and military aid in exchange for the bases, but the
Philippine demands have ranged to more than $1.2 billion.
   U.S. officials have said they accept the constitutional
provision but oppose the Senate bill, which they claim would
cripple military operations at Subic Bay naval base, Clark Air Base
and four smaller facilities.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, chief sponsor of the anti-nuclear bill and
a prominent opponent of the bases, said the Ordonez opinion ``gives
the president the unconscionable option which is not hers _ to risk
the lives, property and future of our people and our country.''
   Majority floor leader Orlando Mercado, who supported the bill,
told reporters the opinion was not binding on the legislature and
the Supreme Court might ultimately decide the meaning of the
constitutional provision.
   In a report on the war, Press Secretary Teodoro Benigno quoted a
military report as saying at least 1,934 people _ 483 civilians,
904 rebels, and 547 police and soldiers _ had been killed in the
first half of 1988.
   The report was issued two days after leaders of the New People's
Army, the Communist rebel group that began fighting in 1969,
rejected a call by the nation's Roman Catholic bishops for
resumption of peace talks, which broke down in February 1987.

   The other day a friend of mine back home asked me if I were
really excited about the prospect of Michael Dukakis becoming
president. When I said I was, he said, ``Bill, I can understand why
you think he should be president, but how can you get excited about
a guy who's so clean he squeaks when he walks and who mows his yard
with a hand-powered mower?''
   Well, I thought about it. And I decided that's one reason I was
excited.
   He's old-fashioned all right: he's the kind of man who plays it
straight, keeps his word, and pays his bills.
   In Arkansas, we say he's the kind of man you can ``tie to.''
   Don't misunderstand me. He's not perfect. I have to confess
right here in The Omni, home of the Atlanta Hawks, that he loves
the Boston Celtics. During the playoffs, he even watched them while
making campaign phone calls.
   Still, I think Michael Dukakis should be president because he
has the character, the record, and the vision America needs at this
moment in our journey. And Michael Dukakis should be president
because he is the right man for our times.
   His character is steadfast and consistent. He wakes up in the
same world every day, a trait of no small importance in a president.
   I have found him self-confident, but willing to listen to other
people. That's a lesson he and I learned the hard way _ we got beat
over the head with it. Both of us were elected, defeated, then
given a rare second chance by our people. That does wonders for
your sensitivity to others and their views.
   Mike and I met after our defeats. He was teaching at the Kennedy
School and I was the youngest ex-governor in American history. I
was struck even then by his lack of bitterness, his eagerness to
learn, and his continuing, genuine commitment to public life, in or
out of office.
   As someone who's worked with him on hard issues in the National
Governor's Association, who's hammered out compromises with him,
disagreed with him, and fought battles by his side, I can tell you
one thing: when he needs to be, Michael Dukakis is tough as nails.
   Of course, if he hadn't been tough, he never could have come
back from his defeat. When that happens to most people, they pull
the shades, rip the phone off the wall, and pack it in. Not Mike
Dukakis. He hangs in there.

   The Security Council unanimously adopted a
mild resolution on Wednesday expressing ``deep distress'' over the
U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner, which killed 290 people.
   The council also urged that a U.N. cease-fire and peace plan
quickly be put into effect in the Iran-Iraq war, which began in
September 1980.
   After days of negotiations, the 15-member council adopted a
watered-down document that would satisfy both America and Iran and
not provoke a U.S. veto.
   But Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati later told
reporters, ``I am not satisfied. We expected the resolution would
play a more important role in bringing security to civil aviation.''
   He added there were ``some positive elements'' in the
resolution, citing the call for stricter observance of
international regulations on safety of civil aviation.
   Mahallati also objected to the U.S. offer of compensation to
families of the victims of airliner incident. The United States has
said no payment will go to Tehran, with which it has no diplomatic
relations.
   ``The United States is obliged to pay compensations, not only to
the families but to the government,'' Mahallati said in answer to a
question. ``I don't think we shall accept anything which is below
what the United States is obliged to do.
   He said that if the United States fails to pay Tehran, ``there
are other measures the United Nations should consider.''
   It could take the case to the International Court of Justice.
   The USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Air Airbus over the Persian
Gulf on July 3. The United States said the missile cruiser mistook
the passenger jet for an attacking Iranian warplane.
   The Security Council action came one year to the day after it
unanimously adopted Resolution 598, demanding an immediate
cease-fire and troop withdrawal in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran had requested the council session after boycotting the body
for eight years. It returned to urge condemnation of the downing of
the airliner and demand withdrawal of all U.S. forces from the
waterway.
   But Iran was unable to muster enough votes to condemn the United
States.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters said the resolution puts the
Airbus disaster in ``proper perspective'' and said the conflict in
the gulf must end. He told the council: ``The Airbus accident is
only part of a much larger human tragedy: the Iran-Iraq war.''
   He said the United States welcomes Iran's announcement that it
fully accepts Resolution 598 and said, ``Now a large obstacle has
been overcome.''
   Walters said, ``We intend to stick with our effective gulf
policy ... Once tensions decrease and the treat to Western
interests dissipates, then the level of our naval presence will
naturally be reduced.''
   He said the U.S. naval presence ``is a force for peace ... in
support of regional states whose interests and those of the West
face a very real threat.''
   Diplomats said the council deleted controversial passages to
ensure passage of the brief resolution. It erased a sentence
proposed by Iran calling on foreign naval forces to reassess their
presence in the gulf and eliminated a U.S. call for freedom of
navigation. It deleted strong language of condemnation to avoid a
U.S. veto.
   The resolution said the council ``expresses its deep distress at
the downing of an Iranian civil aircraft by a missile fired from a
U.S. warship and profound regret over the tragic loss of innocent
lives.''
   It urged all parties to the Chicago Convention of 1944 on
international civil aviation to fully observe all rules and
practices concerning safety of civilian aircraft.
   The resolution also said the council ``stresses the need for a
full and rapid implementation of its resolution 598 of 1987, as the
only basis for a comprehensive, just, honorable and durable
settlement of the conflict between Iran and iraq.''
   It reaffirmed support for Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar in implementating the resolution, which calls for a
cease-fire, troop withdrawal, prisoner exchange, impartial body to
determine the aggressor and a comprehensive peace settlement
   Council members are the United States, the Soviet Union,
Britain, France and China _ the five permanent members with veto
power _ and Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Japan, Nepal,
Senegal, West Germany, Yugoslavia and Zambia.

   Mike Dukakis has unshakable integrity. One of his Massachusetts
political opponents said of him, ``He's got the strongest moral
core of any man I ever met in public life.''
   He believes actions are more important than words. He has a
passionate sense that performance matters. That's why two years ago
his fellow governors, including the Republicans, voted him the
``most effective'' governor in America. When the Republicans take
out after him, I'm going to remind them of that vote.
   When Michael Dukakis speaks out for the American family, you can
believe him. I have never known anyone more devoted to his wife and
children. He and Kitty are different, but they're wonderful
together. They're great role models for our young people. And Kitty
will be a first lady who will make America proud and win the
world's respect.
   Mike's record is as strong and solid as his character.
   For many years, I have watched him as governor. He has also been
a soldier, a lawyer, a teacher, a legislator.
   He has excelled in all these roles, because of his fine mind and
his keen interest in other people.
   He can speak to more Americans in their native tongues than
anyone our party has ever nominated: in his own Greek, French,
Italian, and as millions now know, in Spanish.
   As governor, he hasn't just played with issues, he's wrestled
them to the ground. He has made the hard decisions: to balance
budgets, create jobs, fight crime and drug abuse, move people from
welfare to work, expand day care and health care,
   Michael Dukakis knows how to translate ideas into action. One of
our major news magazines called him the ``master of innovation.''
   More than any other governor, he has worked to bring good jobs
to his poor communities and poor people. Long before he knew he
would be a presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis told me he
couldn't believe there was no national plan, no leadership effort
to give the depressed areas of our country the same opportunities
his people in Massachusetts enjoy.
   He believes that all citizens should lead productive lives. His
welfare reform program ``E.T.'' has been a model for the national
welfare reform effort for one simple reason: it has taken people
off of welfare rolls and put them on payrolls.

   A deaf church janitor who was ``more
at ease with kids than with adults'' was arraigned Wednesday on
charges of kidnapping three young girls and keeping one in a dirt
crawl space for as long as six weeks.
   Kenneth Alvin Michel, 32, did not enter a plea after Municipal
Court Judge John Stroud advised him of the charges and appointed a
public defender to represent him.
   Michel, using sign language and head nods to speak through an
interpreter, said he had only $1,400 to pay legal fees.
   The judge set bail at $1 million and said he would consider a
motion by the district attorney's office to deny bail at an Aug. 9
hearing.
   Deputy District Attorney Ken Peterson said Michel could face
more than 35 years in prison if convicted. He said his office was
still evaluating evidence to determine whether to file additional
charges.
   Michel was arrested Monday at the United Methodist Church in
suburban Elk Grove, where he was a part-time custodian. Police said
they traced the license plate on a car that was allegedly involved
in a kidnapping incident earlier in the day.
   Officers found two missing girls at the church. Five-year-old
Muey Han Saefong was kidnapped Monday in Sacramento and was found
in the back of Michel's car, her mouth taped and legs bound, police
said.
   Four-year-old Candi Talarico, who was kidnapped June 4 while
playing outside her apartment, was found in an L-shaped space under
the altar, police said.
   Officers said the space had a dirt floor, concrete walls and a
wooden ceiling. It was furnished with blankets, stuffed animals,
books, food, lights, a television and newspapers that contained
articles about the kidnapping, which was featured on Fox
Broadcasting Co.'s ``America's Most Wanted'' TV program.
   Muey and Candi were examined at a hospital after their rescue
and returned to their parents.
   At a news conference Tuesday, the church's pastor, Linda Inlow,
said it was doubtful anyone would have heard Candi if she had
yelled for help.
   She said that Candi was kept in a 7-by-9-by-3 foot space under a
crawl space floor. She said Michel apparently cut a hole in the
floor to gain access to another space that extended three or four
more feet below.
   Friends and relatives have described Michel as a gentle man who
loved children but was lonely and had trouble communicating because
of a speech handicap.
   ``He was very, very protective of kids,'' said H.F. Frost, who
lived next door for several years. ``If one of my grandkids got out
in the street, he'd run out and grab them. He was more at ease with
kids than with adults. He took to them. He played with them by the
hour.''
   The Rev. David Delaplane, an adviser to Inlow, said Michel was
placed on leave of absence last spring by a day care center where
he also worked.
   Delaplane said that some children had teased Michel because of
his disabilities and that Michel ``reacted out of frustration'' and
pinched them. The day care center leased space from the church.
   Michel is accused of kidnapping Muey, Candi and 6-year-old Daisy
Jones, who was abducted Monday morning in Elk Grove but escaped
moments later. Peterson said prosecutors felt Daisy had been in
Michel's possession long enough to warrant filing charges of
kidnapping instead of attempted kidnapping.
   Sgt. Bob Burns said a witness got the license number of the car
used. The witness said he was driving to work when saw a man
running down a busy street with a screaming child in his arms. The
girl broke free.

   A convicted police killer escaped
Wednesday from a prison by driving away in the prison
superintendent's car armed with the superintendent's shotgun,
authorities said.
   Earl R. Jacobs, 51, was discovered missing from the Chillicothe
Correctional Institution during a prison count shortly before 11
a.m., said Lynn Goff, personnel officer at the prison.
   She said Jacobs entered Superintendent Arthur Tate Jr.'s
unoccupied and unlocked home on the prison grounds, then took the
car keys and a shotgun owned by Tate before escaping in Tate's car.
   The car was parked outside his house at the time it was taken.
Ms. Goff said Jacobs was not supposed to be in the area around the
house and that officials were alarmed by the discovery that he has
a weapon.
   ``We're really, really concerned about that,'' she said.
   Jacobs had been in jail since he was 25, when he was sentenced
to life in prison for killing a police officer in Logan County in
1962. He was classified as a minimum-security prisoner, Ms. Goff
said, which means he was allowed to work unsupervised on the
prison's honor farm outside the prison compound.
   ``He was a minimum-security prisoner, so he was obviously not
considered a real threat,'' said Ms. Goff. ``But any escaped felon
should be considered dangerous.''

   He knows from his own experience that government cannot solve
problems alone. But unlike the present administration, he also
knows government cannot leave them alone. That's why he's broken
new ground by building partnerships _ partnerships with business,
with labor, with educators, with local governments, with anyone
willing to work with him to solve problems and seize opportunities.
   He's worked with welfare recipients like Ruby Sampson, a single
parent dependent on welfare for 14 years, to help her get the
education and training she needed to land a job as an operating
room technician. She now makes more than $20,000 a year.
   He's worked with local officials like the mayor of Taunton,
Mass., to lower the city's unemployment rate from over 14 per cent
to under 4 per cent.
   He's worked with troubled companies like Diamond International
and Morse Tool, to keep them open, saving the jobs of hundreds of
his people.
   He knows we may want the government off our back, but we sure
need it by our side.
   Michael Dukakis knows that working together works. And he's
proved that once again by bringing us together in magnificent unity
at this convention.
   Michael Dukakis is a man with a vision, a shining vision for
America _ a country with good jobs at good wages; a country where
all Americans can send their children to good public schools and
can afford to send them to college; a country where working parents
have access to good child care and health care for their kids; one
where people can get decent long-term care without going to the
poorhouse; a country with a clean environment and, yes, a clean
government devoted once again to the rule of law.
   He wants a country that can compete and win in the world
economy; and one that will seek a safer world, an enduring peace
for ourselves and our children. Michael Dukakis will continue to
work for arms control across the table from Mr. Gorbachev and, as
commander-in-chief, he will make sure American interests are
strongly represented around the globe.
   In any time, because of his character, his record, and his
vision, Michael Dukakis would be a proud standard-bearer for our
party.

<HEAD>RETRANSMITTING to restore paragraph indentation between 1st and

<TEXT>
   Soviet inspectors counted U.S.
nuclear missiles in Britain Wednesday under the historic superpower
treaty to eliminate an entire class of such weapons. But they want
to see the Tower of London, too.
   ``At the beginning of the inspection they requested a
sight-seeing visit to London,'' Defense Ministry spokesman Martin
Helm said Wednesday.
   ``Clearly there's no provision in the INF (intermediate-range
nuclear forces) Treaty for the inspectors and air crew to move off
base. But we will be pleased to arrange a trip to make the visit
enjoyable,'' he added.
   So Thursday will be sight-seeing day for the 20 Soviet
inspectors.
   The inspectors flew in Tuesday from Moscow to make their checks
at Greenham Common airbase, 50 miles west of London; and at
Britain's other cruise missile base, Molesworth, near Cambridge.
Both bases are run by the U.S. military.
   The checks are part of a 60-day period of inspections that
started July 1 to verify whether each side told the truth about
deployments. The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States
and five Western European countries. U.S. inspectors are visiting
133 sites in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. No violations
have been reported thus far.
   A group of 20 U.S. missile experts on Wednesday ended their
inspections of installations in East Germany, the official East
German news agency ADN said.
   It said the Americans split into two groups to inspect four
former Soviet missile sites in Waren, Bischofswerda, Wokul and
Koenigsbrueck, East Germany.
   Also Wednesday, the official Czechoslovak news agency CTK said
the government granted permission for U.S. experts to inspect a
former missile base at Hranice, central Czechoslovakia, under the
INF treaty. It said the 10 Americans will arrive Thursday.
   The INF treaty, signed in December, provides for elimination
within three years of all land-based missiles in Europe with ranges
of 300 to 3,000 miles. The Soviet inspectors began their checks in
Britain at noon Wednesday, splitting up into two teams to visit
both bases.
   Under the U.S.-Soviet treaty, which provided for unprecedented
review of each other's facilities, each inspection can last up to
24 hours, with a possible eight-hour extension.
   The Soviets, who gave the required 16 hours notice of arrival
and declared formally Wednesday morning what they wanted to see,
may take four hours to write their reports after inspections.
   The inspections at Greenham Common, with 96 working missiles,
and Molesworth, with 16, are the first in Britain.
   The ground-hugging, difficult-to-detect cruise missiles, which
provide a vehicle for the warheads, and their 55-foot mobile
launchers are housed in bunkers. The Soviets will not see the
warheads, which carry the explosive material, because the warheads
do not have to be destroyed under the treaty.
   The Soviet inspectors were staying in specially converted
barracks.
   Entertainment to date consisted of a bus tour of the Greenham
base Tuesday evening and a visit to an on-base gift shop, the U.S.
military said.
   But on Thursday, after being cooped up under tight security with
geiger counters, tape measures, missiles, and mobile launchers, the
Soviets will do some fancy sight-seeing.
   The Defense Ministry said that among the tourist attractions the
Soviets will view is the Royal Tournament, held each summer at the
Earls Court Exhibition Center in west London _ a spectacular
display by Britain's armed forces of massed bands, gymnastics and
show-jumping.
   U.S. and British military officers will accompany them.
   The Soviet inspectors were expected to return to Greenham for
the night before leaving Friday, officials said.

   But at this time in our history, Michael Dukakis is THE man for
America.
   The post-World War II era, when America dominated the world,
economically, politically, and militarily, is over. For the rest of
our lives we will have to compete with people in other countries
for new jobs, new business opportunities, and technological
breakthroughs. As we have learned painfully in the last decade, we
won't win if we're not prepared.
   The Republicans' main claim to the White House this year is that
in the face of competition and adversity, the administration
produced a five-year recovery. Well, that recovery left a lot of
people and places behind, was financed by a sea of borrowed money,
and ignored or aggravated, some harsh realities: the rise of huge
budget and trade deficits; the loss of our competitive position in
low-wage, low-skill, and import sensitive industries, in
agriculture, energy and mining, and in some high-tech areas too;
the growth of a vast new class of poor people, most of them young
women and their little children; an epidemic of social problems;
and a decline in real wages.
   Left unattended, these difficulties could threaten not only our
children's future, but our own.
   In the first half of the 1980s, for the first time in my
lifetime, only 40 percent of our people had an increase in their
incomes, while 20 percent stood still, and 40 percent actually
suffered a reduction in real wages. We used to believe a rising
economic tide lifts all boats. Today's tide is drowning four in 10
of our people who have fallen off the boat, and the Republican crew
won't even throw a life raft to the women and children.
   There are those who see these developments as evidence that our
nation is in decline. Best-selling books predict a downhill slide
that we either cannot or will not stop.
   Michael Dukakis doesn't believe that for a minute. He believes
America's best days lie ahead. He reminds us that we've faced even
greater challenges in the past. He is an apostle of hope.
   Last night when Jesse Jackson gave that awesome, wonderful
speech, many of you waved signs with his slogan: ``Keep Hope
Alive.'' In his own way, Mike Dukakis will never let us forget that
admonition. We all must be apostles of hope. As the scripture says:
Let us not grow weary in doing good, for in due season we shall
reap, if we do not lose heart.

   Jessica Hahn, whose sexual revelations
toppled PTL evangelist Jim Bakker, said Wednesday she will happily
return $160,000 in hush money and that she has offered to make
fund-raising appearances for the beleaguered ministry.
   PTL officials turned her down for fund-raising, she said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds in Columbia, S.C., on
Tuesday ordered Miss Hahn to return $160,000, including accrued
interest, from a $150,000 trust fund PTL set up for her in 1985.
   PTL, which is in bankruptcy reorganization, sued Miss Hahn in
April, claiming she broke her agreement with the ministry to remain
silent about her December 1980 tryst with Bakker at a Florida hotel.
   Miss Hahn said she would not challenge the order.
   ``I never wanted that money,'' she said. ``All I ever wanted was
an apology.'' She said she would happily give it back to help the
financially troubled ministry.
   ``I want to see the PTL go on,'' she said. ``I feel bad that
they have suffered the way they did.''
   ``I offered to go on TV and raise funds but they don't want me
because of my lifestyle,'' she said. ``They don't realize that the
church is for saints and sinners.''
   Bakker resigned after the PTL scandal broke last year. Miss Hahn
sold her story, illustrated with semi-nude photos, to Playboy
magazine for a reported $1 million.
   ``God's been good to me,'' said Miss Hahn, a former Long Island
church secretary.
   After Bakker resigned in March 1987, it was revealed that he and
his wife, Tammy, had received millions of dollars in salaries and
bonuses from PTL.
   The television ministry filed for reorganization under
bankruptcy law last year with $130 million in debts.
   Hahn's transaction, as well as other Bakker financial dealings
at PTL, are being investigated by a federal grand jury for possible
tax fraud.
   Miss Hahn said she would make more revelations about ``other
people in my life'' in the September issue of Playboy. She said she
would be on the cover ``wearing not much.''
   ``I'm learning to turn the other cheek and get on with my
life,'' Miss Hahn said a hotel in Hollywood, Calif.
   She said she recently moved out of the Playboy Mansion in Los
Angeles because she wanted to learn to be on her own.

   Michael Dukakis is a builder who wants to build a bridge to
tomorrow: Strong enough to carry our heaviest load; wide enough for
all of us to walk across together; long enough to take us into the
2lst century.
   He's got a big job to do. And we have to help him. His economic
challenge is to reduce our debt; to nourish our entrepreneurs and
small business people who create most of our jobs; to promote new
relationships between business and labor in which risk, loss, and
gain are shared; to reduce the scandalous waste of money consumed
by hostile mergers and takeovers that cost jobs; to get much more
cooperation from our major competitors in Europe and Japan in
making economic and defense policies; to fight for a fair trading
system that gives us the chance to sell more as well as buy more;
and to reduce the debt of the developing nations in Latin America
whose futures are so tightly bound to our own.
   This is an ambitious agenda, but Michael Dukakis has great
ambitions for America.
   Yet, even if he carries it off, America still could be in
trouble.
   Why? Because compared to all the world's major economic powers,
we do the worst job of developing our most precious resource _ our
people.
   We let more babies die than others do. A child born in Costa
Rica has a better chance of living to be a year old than one born
tonight in our nation's capital.
   We stand by while more of our children have children than others
do, swelling the number of our ``truly disadvantaged.''
   We accept far more adult illiteracy than others do, though we
know 80 percent of the work force in the year 2000 will be composed
of people who are already working and that sooner or later our
workers' inability to read will catch up with them and catch up
with us.
   We tolerate more homeless children than others do, degrading the
most blameless among us.
   We live in the only advanced country that's still in the Dark
Ages when it comes to child care.
   Our school dropout rates are more than twice those of our major
competitors.

   Recent thundershowers in the Midwest have dropped much-needed
rain on thirsty crops, but officials said Wednesday the rainfall
hasn't signaled the end of the drought or the end of the crisis for
cornfields.
   The benefits of an inch of rain will be short-lived if hot, dry
weather returns _ and it will, the National Weather Service says.
The agency's 30-day outlook for the Midwest calls for above-normal
temperatures with below-normal rainfall.
   InptTe meantime, some farmers fortunate enough to have received
some relief were happy.
   ``It's a godsend,'' said Herman Krone, whose 2,800-acre southern
Illinois farm, visited last week by President Reagan, was drenched
by more than 3 inches of rain in 24 hours.
   ``It's really helped,'' said Donald Hegeman, who farms about 700
acres near Cosby, Mo. ``Pessimism turns to optimism with every drop
of rain,'' he added.
   In Kentucky, this week's rainfall has helped recharge ponds,
streams and rivers, said Mike Callahan, a hydrologist with the
National Weather Service in Louisville.
   ``The Ohio River is actually starting to come up now,'' he said.
   But not everyone has been so lucky.
   ``I can't even remember the last rain,'' said a discouraged
Sonny Wiederkehr, a Texas rancher with 3,000 acres in Duval and
McMullen counties, also parched by drought.
   ``It looks like the pavement _ nothing there,'' he said of his
pastures.
   For many drought-stricken cornfields, the rain comes too late,
experts say.
   ``Every little drop is good news,'' said Al Almy of the Michigan
Farm Bureau.
   ``But even if we get sufficient rainfall now, we're still past
the point of no return. The damage has been done,'' Almy said.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said
Wednesday higher-than-normal rain is expected over the next five
days for the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the region
comprising Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia and southern Ohio.
   The weather is expected to be drier-than normal in the area from
Michigan and Wisconsin, stretching southwest across the cornbelt
states to Kansas, Oklahoma and north Texas.
   In Pennsylvania, farmers and agriculture officials said the
recent rainfall, although helpful, isn't enough to reverse effects
of the drought. Some areas are more than 10 inches below normal
levels, according to Susan Woods, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Environmental Resources.
   The scattered rainfall, generally ranging from 1 to 2 inches in
the Midwest, has helped some crops, including soybeans, agriculture
experts said.
   But severe damage to corn can't be reversed, they said, since
that crop was stricken by drought at a critical point in its
development.
   ``Most of the early corn is in bad shape and unlikely to respond
to any amount of rain,'' said Tom Womack of the Tennessee
Department of Agriculture.
   ``But there are still a lot of crops out there that aren't yet
developed. As long as we get showers every week through the growing
season, we should have decent yields of soybeans, tobacco and
cotton.''
   Wednesday's rainfall ``doesn't mean the drought's over with, of
course, because we've got a big rain deficit,'' said meteorologist
John Wright of the National Weather Service's Midwest Agricultural
Weather Service Center at Purdue University in Indiana.
   In Illinois, for example, a normal statewide average of rainfall
for this time of year is about 21 inches, said Wayne Wendland of
the Illinois State Water Survey.
   But Illinois has only received between 11 and 15 inches this
year, he said.
   The only community in the Midwest that has recorded normal
rainfall is the tiny town of Iuka in southern Illinois, Wendland
said.
   They caught up two weeks ago, when 4 inches fell in one day.

   When our kids do get out of school, they have about two years
less learning than young people in Germany and Japan who are
competing for those good jobs Mike Dukakis wants them to have.
   A lot of our young people want to go on to college, but can't
afford to, so they go right to work in a tough world economy that
pays young unskilled workers 25 to 40 percent less than 15 years
ago.
   What's all this got to do with you if you're not poor, your kids
are in college, you have a job, and your company's doing fine?
   I'll tell you what _ all these people in trouble are growing as
a percent of our population. If they can't do the jobs of today and
tomorrow, we'll all be in trouble.
   I want Michael Dukakis to be president because he knows we don't
have a single person to waste.
   I want Michael Dukakis to be president because he cares that one
in four of our children under 5 is living in poverty and that
without good child health programs and preschool for those who need
it, we are cheating their future _ and ours.
   I want Michael Dukakis to be president because he understands
that today it costs a middle-class family much more of its income
to send a child to college than it did when he and I went a
generation ago, and that government has to help make up the
difference.
   I want Michael Dukakis to be president because he knows one big
reason hundred of thousands of parents and children are homeless is
that this administration has cut government housing starts by 800
percent since 1980.
   I want Michael Dukakis to be president because he feels the pain
of a mother who leaves for work every day worried sick about her
children not being in a good affordable day care center, partly due
to the government's feeble efforts in child care.
   I want Michael Dukakis to be president, not just because he
knows and cares about these problems, but because he's tackled them
in his state, and he's proved _ time and again _ that he can make a
difference in people's lives.
   When the Republicans gather in New Orleans next month, they'll
talk about these family problems too. They'll feature some of their
good governors. Just remember, they had the White House for eight,
long years and did nothing.

   The American Civil Liberties Union joined
Oliver North and two other Iran-Contra defendants on Wednesday in
asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to dismiss charges against the
three men on ground that immunized testimony would be used against
them at trial.
   North, former White House national security adviser John M.
Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim, along with the ACLU, said
the use of testimony the three men gave Congress last year would
violate their Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.
   At the minimum, they said, the appellate court should order U.S.
District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell to hold a pre-trial hearing to
give them an opportunity to show that the evidence to be used
against them is tainted.
   Last month, Gesell rejected the defendants' complaints that the
conspiracy case is based on tainted evidence.
   He said he had conducted an extensive preliminary inquiry,
including an inspection of grand jury testimony and exhibits in his
chambers, and found ``nothing'' suggesting that any of the
defendants have had their Fifth Amendment rights impaired ``in a
manner that significantly affects their right to a fair trial.
   ``Given these factual circumstances,'' Gesell held in a 34-page
ruling, ``it is not difficult to reach a preliminary decision that
the case should proceed to trial.''
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, and his former boss,
Poindexter, and Hakim testified extensively last year before the
joint congressional Iran-Contra committees under grants of
immunity. A fourth defendant, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard
V. Secord, also testified but without immunity.
   Attorneys for North filed a motion with Gesell to delay the
start of the trial, now scheduled for Sept. 20, until March 1989.
   ``To force a trial at that time (Sept. 20) would cause a
proceeding without even the semblance of fairness and run afoul of
the most basic principles of due process required by the
Constitution,'' said North attorney Barry S. Simon.
   North is charged with conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran
arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. Poindexter, Hakim and
Secord are accused of carrying out a secret operation to put funds
from Iran arms sales and other sources into unauthorized hands for
personal profit ``by deceiving Congress, obstructing
investigations, altering documents, abusing the tax laws, and by
other means prohibited by law.''
   In their motion, the three defendants said there were critical
issues ``arising out of the decision of the United States
government to compel testimony and other information from
(them)...to broadcast that immunized testimony live to tens of
millions of people around the world, and then to indict and seek to
try these men for the matters as to which they testified.
   ``Never before has the government disseminated immunized
testimony of putative defendants so widely, and never before has
immunized testimony caught so much rapt attention,'' they argued.
   ``Given the infusion of immunized testimony in our community by
choice of the government, (defendants) submit that the broad use
and derivative use of immunized testimony by the grand jury, the
prosecutors, and the witnesses has been inevitable, and that no
satisfactory showing - is possible as a matter of law.
   ``At a bare minimum, (defendants) submit that the indictment
must be dismissed unless the government can meet its extraordinary
burden of proving no `use,' with the defense having a fair
opportunity to test the government's showing in a proper
adversarial posture,'' the said.
   Kate Martin, director of the ACLU Foundation National Security
Project, who filed the organization's ``friend of the court''
brief, told a news conference: ``This prosecution violates the
basic principle that the government cannot force an individual to
be a witness against him or herself.''
   She said the ACLU has no reason to question the good faith of
the independent counsel's office in attempting to avoid the use of
immunized testimony.
   ``However, the issue is not whether the prosecutor acted in good
faith, but whether the defendant's constitutional rights are
violated,'' said Ms. Martin. ``It is critically important that
these rights be afforded even to those who may have themselves
subverted the Constitution. To shrink from protecting these basic
rights would pose as great a threat to our liberties as any posed
by the Iran-Contra affair.''

<HEAD>Arizona Delegates Complain About Cartoon Depiction of Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB ANEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona delegates to the Democratic National
Convention reacted angrily Wednesday to what they said was a racist
political cartoon in the Phoenix Gazette making fun of Jesse
Jackson's presidential bid.
   The cartoon showed a miniature likeness of Jackson, dressed in
the garb of an Old South stable hand and holding out a ring used
for tethering horses. Jackson is poised in front of
plantation-style White House where Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis is telling his wife: ``Well Kitty, I think we've found a
spot for Jesse.''
   Sixty members of the Arizona contingent, including 53 of the 55
delegates and alternates, had signed a letter to the editor by the
time the convention resumed Wednesday night. The letter said the
cartoon portrayed Arizona as a ``haven for racism'' and demanded an
apology from the newspaper.
   Larry Ferguson, a Gazette editorial writer who approved the
cartoon, defended it as ``reasonable comment for a cartoonist'' and
said no apology was warranted.
   Stanley Lubin, a Dukakis alternate from Phoenix who drafted the
petition, called the cartoon an ``insensitive piece of journalism.''
   ``If they politically don't like what we're doing, that's
fine,'' he added. ``If they don't like Jesse Jackson, that's fine.
But to depict Jesse Jackson as slave in front of a plantation is
disgusting.''
   Ferguson said cartoonist Len Borozinski is given a great deal of
latitude in what he draws and that ``all cartoonists have weird
minds.''
   ``He put himself in Dukakis' place,'' Ferguson said. ``He sees
Dukakis as having slighted Jesse and that Dukakis would really like
to see the Reverend Jackson someplace other than his present
position.''

   Enrollment at the Bible college named
for defrocked Assemblies of God minister Jimmy Swaggart will drop
72 percent this year, but the school will proceed with plans to
open a theological seminary, an attorney said.
   Enrollment at Jimmy Swaggart Bible College on Aug. 29 will be
about 400, compared with 1,451 students last year, attorney William
Treeby said Wednesday. The estimate is based on the number of
students who have registered and the inquiries from potential
students.
   The seminary will open with 12 students.
   ``We've just started to promote the Bible college through the
television program and have received a lot of calls,'' Treeby said.
``We'll have room for more. We'll know more when classes start.''
   Some faculty and students left the school after Swaggart was
defrocked following his confession to unspecified sins. Debra
Murphree, an admitted prostitute, said she posed naked for Swaggart
in a New Orleans-area motel.

<TEXT>
   Just as he did in Massachusetts, President Dukakis will insist
that we all become partners in the fight for America's future, that
we share the responsibility of forging it so that we can share the
glory of achieving it.
   He'll have business partners like Eugene Lang, a wealthy
businessman, who decided to ``keep hope alive'' at his old
elementary school in Harlem. He gave the poor children there a
dream of their own by promising all who would stay in school a
scholarship to college. Michael Dukakis will share and spread that
dream.
   He'll have teaching partners like Jaime Escalante, the hero of
the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' whose entire class of poor
students in east Los Angeles stunned the education world by passing
the Advanced Placement Calculus test, under the guidance of a
teacher who believes that all children can learn, and that students
will perform at the level of our expectation. My friends, when it
comes to education, Michael Dukakis will stand and deliver.
   He'll have public service partners like Marian Edelman, the
president of the Children's Defense Fund, who has fought a
courageous, bipartisan battle in Congress for early investment in
children, reminding us all that we can invest in them now or pay a
much higher price for our neglect later. Michael Dukakis knows we
must invest in our children while they still have a future.
   He'll have political partners like Lloyd Bentsen, who built a
successful business, then went back into politics to keep our free
enterprise system and our nation's defenses strong so that others
could have the same chance he had to succeed, and who has had a
lifetime commitment to the principle that everybody should have
that chance.
   Michael Dukakis will have political partners like Jesse Jackson,
who in 1977, long before it was popular, went with me into the
Arkansas public schools to plead with the students to say ``no'' to
drugs, to ``open their brains and not their veins.'' Like Jesse
Jackson, Michael Dukakis has fought for drug-free schools with his
Governor's Alliance Against Drugs. Like Jesse Jackson, Michael
Dukakis knows it's not enough to urge our children to ``Just Say
No'' to drugs. They must be able to say ``Yes'' to life, too.
   Not long ago, police in Detroit broke the biggest crack ring in
that city. It was being run by two brothers from the Mississippi
Delta area of Arkansas. They had brought over 100 other young men
up from their home county to help them peddle dope.

<TEXT>
   An IRA man serving life for the 1979
assassination of Earl Mountbatten fired a gun in a Dublin
courthouse Wednesday _ hitting no one _ and then won a damage suit
against his prison warden.
   Police said Thomas McMahon, 40, pulled out a gun while being
held in a second-floor cell in Dublin's High Court and fired one
shot that struck a wall before two guards overpowered him.
   McMahon was later escorted to courtroom No. 1 for the hearing of
his suit against the warden of Portlaoise Prison. The prisoner
asked for compensation for what he said was a broken wrist suffered
during a strip search in 1983.
   After 1{ hours deliberation, the jury found for McMahon and
awarded him $5,950. McMahon showed no emotion as he was rushed out
of the courtroom and back to jail.
   The suit was against the warden in his capacity as an employee
of the Irish state.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it
was not clear how McMahon acquired the weapon. Screening of the
public was abandoned at the court years ago, he said.
   McMahon, of Carrickmacross in County Monaghan, has been serving
a life term at the high-security prison since his conviction in
November 1979.
   Mountbatten, a World War II hero, cousin of Queen Elizbaeth II
and the last British viceroy of India, was killed Aug. 27, 1979, in
a bomb blast aboard his yacht off northwest Ireland. Three other
people also died in the bombing.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army said it carried out the
killing as part of its campaign to oust the British from Northern
Ireland and reunite the province with the Irish Republic.

   Udall, who has Parkinson's Disease, had been expected to make an

   The news reports said these country boys were more reliable than
the street-smart city kids. They gave a good day's work for a good
day's pay.
   The unemployment rate in the county these boys fled is almost 20
percent.
   For black teen-agers, it's more than twice that. Most farmers
and business people there are too broke to help get them off the
street. Those kids could make more money in a month in Detroit than
they could in a year back home.
   I wonder if their decision to deal misery for money would have
been different if President Dukakis had had eight years to make
good on his commitment to good schools and good jobs for all our
people in all our communities. I think they might have been able to
say ``No to drugs'' and ``Yes to life.''
   My friends, we are moving into a future which richly rewards
learning, achievement, and innovation. It punishes ignorance and
waste and the pursuit of short-term profits at the expense of
long-term growth.
   We need a president who understands the future and its
challenges. Michael Dukakis does.
   This is one of those pivotal moments in our history. The issue
is not whether we move left or right _ it is whether we move ahead
or fall behind. It's impossible to stand still in the strong
currents of change which engulf us.
   In these times of change, the Democratic Party has a place for
all Americans who share our vision of the future and want to do
their part: Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Michael
Dukakis has proved he will reach out to bring us all together.
   The strength of his message rests on two simple but powerful
ideas.
   The first is that we are all in this fight for the future
together. Whether they know it or not, the future of the California
entrepreneur and the New York investment banker is tied to the
drought-stricken, debt-ridden farmer in North Dakota and he poorest
black school child in Mississippi.
   We're all in this together. The second idea is that we must be
willing to do what it takes today to guarantee our children's
tomorrow.

   Jimmy Carter threw a party for his former White
House staffers Wednesday, and 400 of them showed up to eat, drink
and talk about old times on the Potomac.
   ``It's not everyday you can get Jimmy Carter to buy you a
drink,'' said former press secretary Jody Powell, who now works for
an advertising agency in Washington.
   The lavishly catered reception was held at the Carter
Presidential Center, some four miles east of the site of the
Democrats National Convention.
   ``We're just here to have a good time, not talk politics,''
Carter told reporters who attempted to gauge his feelings about
events at the convention, where Michael Dukakis was being chosen as
this year's nominee. Carter received a warm response when he
addressed the convention Monday night.
   ``It's so great to see all these people,'' said Rosalynn Carter
as she and her husband circulated separately through the crowd.
``I've talked to people I haven't seen in years.''
   Others those who showed up to munch and mingle were former Sen.
Edmund Muskie of Maine, who served an eight-month stint as
secretary of State under Carter and former budget director Bert
Lance.
   Walter Mondale, Carter's vice president, didn't attend the
party. Neither did Hamilton Jordan, his former chief of staff,
whose mother reportedly is seriously ill.
   Muskie recalled his tenure in the Carter administration with
mixed emotions.
   ``It was a damned good time,'' said the former Maine senator,
who now practices law in Washington. ``But my outstanding memory is
of the Iranian hostage crisis; I just wish we could have gotten the
hostages out earlier, even a few days sooner might have made a
difference in the 1980 election.''
   But those who did come, including dozens of fellow Georgians,
showered the Carters with affection. The former president obviously
was delighted as he hugged, kissed and chatted with the small army
of friends and well-wishers, some of whom proffered photographs and
copies of his new trout fishing book to be signed.
   ``This is great,'' he said repeatedly.
   Muskie smiled as he watched Carter circulate through the crowd.
   ``It's evident his star is on the rise,'' he said. ``From now
on, I think, `you'll see a different attitude about his presidency
and about him.''

<TEXT>
   I had a college professor who taught me that the key to
America's success over more than 200 years is that our people have
always believed the future can be better than the present, and that
each individual has a personal, moral responsibility to make it so.
He said we were in college because our parents preferred our future
to their own present. He said, ``As long as the American people
prefer their children's future to their present, we're going to be
all right, but if we ever reach the point where they don't, we've
had it, and don't you ever forget it.''
   Michael Dukakis won't ever forget it. His whole life is a
tribute to the enduring strength of the American dream. He knows
that unless that dream is real for all our children, it is not
secure for any of them. And he'll help us seize the future and make
it ours.
   In November, when Michael Dukakis is elected president, we will
observe the 25th anniversary of President Kennedy's death.
   But Mike's victory will be a tribute to the life and legacy of
John Kennedy, to the boundless optimism, the grace, the courage,
and the sheer joy with which he urged us forward.
   The great Israeli statesman, Abba Eban, began his memorial
tribute to President Kennedy with this simple, stirring statement,
``Tragedy is the difference between what is and what might have
been.''
   Michael Dukakis has spent his entire public life closing the gap
between what is and what might have been. That is why he should be
president of the United States.
   And so my fellow Democrats, I proudly place into nomination the
name of the man who will become the 4lst president of' the United
States, Michael Dukakis.

   The widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told
Democrats Wednesday night they have made real the dreams her late
husband voiced in the civil rights march on Washington 25 years ago.
   ``This is what the dream is all about,'' Coretta Scott King told
more than 4,000 cheering delegates to the Democratic National
Convention _ nearly 30 percent of them supporters of former King
aide Jesse Jackson.
   ``Jesse, Martin would be proud of you and we are proud of you,
by the way you have broadened and expanded the base of political
power in America,'' she proclaimed. ``So many who were formerly
locked out are now locked in.''
   But Mrs. King said many of the dreams her husband voiced in his
1983 speech remain unfulfilled.
   ``Something is still wrong when 32 million Americans are living
in poverty in the richest nation on the face of the earth ... when
nearly 13 million of them are children,'' she said.
   Appealing to Democrats not to abandon them, she said it would be
a tragic mistake to ``attract the haves to any party at the expense
of the have nots.'
   Mrs. King also praised Michael Dukakis for conducting his
campaign for the party's presidential nomination on a
``consistently high plane and spirit.''

   A federal judge Wednesday sentenced
convicted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas to a
maximum life sentence without parole plus 135 years as a sign of
society's determination to expunge ``this cancer.''
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton brushed aside Lehder's
contention that he was a political prisoner.
   Lehder, who prosecutors called a key figure in the Medellin
Cartel drug ring said to be responsible for 80 percent of the
Colombian cocaine coming into the United States, was convicted in
May of importing 3.3 tons of cocaine into the country from his
island smuggling headquarters in the Bahamas.
   Melton imposed the harshest penalty possible under federal law
over defense objections that it exceeded the maximum allowable
under the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.
   The sentence is ``a message .. a signal to our society that it
will do everything it can to rid itself of this cancer,'' Melton
said.
   During a 25-minute speech to the court prior to the sentencing,
Lehder portrayed himself as a victim of the political ambitions of
U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, now a candidate for the Republican
nomination for Florida's U.S. Senate seat.
   ``I have been Mr. Merkle's hostage,'' said Lehder. ``I'm a
political prisoner. My arrest is illegal.''
   He said he had been ``kidnapped'' and illegally brought to this
country because he had been a political leader in Colombia, working
to overthrow the U.S.-Colombia extradition treaty.
   He was a victim of ``mistreatment and harassment ... and
psychological torture ordered by Mr. Merkle,'' Lehder said in
slightly accented English.
   But Melton, who earlier Wednesday sentenced Lehder's
co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed to 15 years in prison, said politics
was not at the root of the case.
   ``You were not convicted because of your political beliefs,
because you are a Colombian,'' the judge said. ``The truth of the
matter is (the smuggling) was done for money ... greed.''
   Prosecutors had asked for life without parole on the charge of
running a continuing criminal enterprise, plus 15 years each of 10
drug-smuggling charges. But under the law one drug-smuggling charge
had to be concurrent with the life sentence, leading to the
135-year total.
   Lehder will also have to pay $350,000 in fines. Reed was fined
$25,000 for his conviction on a single count of conspiracy to
import cocaine.
   Merkle's replacement, U.S. Attorney Joe Magri, who attended the
sentencing as a spectator, called Lehder ``a cocaine
narco-terrorist'' and applauded the sentence.
   ``The judge fairly, justly and appropriately socked it to a
hoodlum,'' said Magri. The sentence ``sends a clear message that
we're serious about stopping narcotics traffic.''
   Lehder, 38, one of the leaders of the violent Medellin Cartel
was convicted May 19 of smuggling Colombian cocaine into the United
States through the Bahamas.
   Defense attorneys Edward Shohat and Jose Quinon had asked the
judge to impose a 20-year sentence at most, which they said would
be four times longer than the terms being served by the former
smugglers who turned against Lehder and testified for the
government.
   After listening to almost four hours of arguments and objections
from Lehder's attorneys to pre-sentence reports, Melton told the
defendant that the government had presented ``monumental amounts of
incriminating evidence against you.''
   Reciting the lengthy list of convictions, the judge said they
did not adequately portray ``the evidence of your crimes.''
   Testimony in the seven-month trial included allegations that
Bahamian officials, including Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling,
helped Lehder and his smuggling organization run more than 20 tons
of cocaine from Colombia through Norman's Cay into deserted
airstrips in Florida and Georgia.
   Pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations.
   Lehder was extradited to the United States last year following a
gun battle and his arrest by the Colombian army at a plush mansion
in Medellin.
   He also is under indictment in Miami for his role in the cartel,
and there is a sealed indictment against him in Los Angeles. But
officials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried on
those charges.
   Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., a pilot in the drug-smuggling
ring, stood silently as he was sentenced. Government witnesses had
testified that he had made at least seven flights from the Bahamas
to ferry 2,500 pounds of cocaine into airports in Florida and
Georgia.

<HEAD>Baker Says He Wouldn't Refuse No. 2 Spot On GOP Ticket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House chief of staff Howard
Baker said Tuesday he doesn't want to be vice president, but he
would accept the Republican nomination for the job if asked.
   The idea of returning to Washington as vice president ``sounds
like somebody trying to revoke my parole,'' Baker told the
Asheville Citizen. He resigned his White House job earlier this
year.
   But Baker said he wouldn't turn down an offer from Vice
President George Bush to take the No. 2 slot on the ticket.
   ``If he caught me and asked me point blank to do it, I would do
it,'' Baker said. ``But before he caught me, I would make an
athletic effort to escape. ... I really don't want to be the vice
presidential candidate.''
   Baker met with reporters briefly after addressing about 400
institutional investors at a seminar at a local hotel. His speech _
for which he reportedly received $30,000 _ was closed to the press.
   Before coming to the White House, Baker served as minority and
majority leader during his 18 years as a U.S. senator from
Tennessee.
   ``I really think that Vice President Bush has some awfully good
men to choose from,'' Baker said. ``He certainly hasn't asked me
and I don't expect he will.''
   Other nominees who might be available to Bush include Illinois
Gov. Richard Thompson, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, Baker said.
   Baker rejected arguments that Bush should choose a Southerner to
join him on the ticket because Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis picked Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas as his running
mate.
   ``I think politics is not a chess game; you don't move and
countermove,'' Baker said. ``I think instead, Vice President Bush
needs to find somebody ... he's compatible with, somebody who's a
good campaigner, somebody who will bring something to the ticket.''
   Although he had high praise for Bentsen, Baker said his
selection will not make a major difference in the presidential
campaign.
   ``I think it's good from the Democratic side. I think that Lloyd
Bentsen is a very capable person, very attractive person,'' Baker
said.
   ``It's a pretty obvious strategy by Governor Dukakis to reach
out to the South and also to give the impression of moving to the
middle, but I don't think it's going to matter much,'' Baker said.
   ``People don't vote for the vice presidential candidate, they
vote for the presidential candidate,'' he said. ``How the South
responds to Michael Dukakis is going to depend almost entirely on
what Dukakis says, not what Bentsen says.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. secretary-general said Wednesday he is
sending a team to Iran and Iraq to work out details of a cease-fire
and will announce a starting date soon. Iraq proposed direct talks
between the belligerents.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, called the
cease-fire date ``D-Day.'' He said he prefers direct negotiations
between the parties, but Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar
Mahallati declared: ``No, No.''
   Iran announced Monday it would accept 598, a year-old Security
Council resolution demanding an end to the 8-year-old war.
   Iran's revolutionary and spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, told his people Wednesday that accepting a truce with
Iraq was ``more deadly to me than poison'' but he asked them to
support his decision. Khomeini had adamantly opposed ending the war
before Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was driven from power. He
said could not reveal yet why he changed his mind.
   The council on Wednesday unanimously adopted a mild resolution
expressing ``deep distress'' over the accidental U.S. destruction
of an Iranian passenger jet on July 3, with the loss of 290 lives.
   Iran wanted the United States condemned for the incident and
Mahallati said after the resolution was adopted, ``I am not
satisfied.'' The United States said the USS Vincennes mistook the
airliner for an attacking Iranian warplane.
   In the Persian Gulf, the war continued. Iran said its jet
fighters flew four sorties Wednesday over northeastern Iraq,
bombing the area around the Dukan Dam and troop positions near Haj
Omran. It said the attacks were retaliation for Iraqi raids Tuesday
on industrial targets in southwestern Iran.
   Iraq said two Iranian jets tried to bomb the dam near Kirkuk at
about dawn but missed and anti-aircraft fire chased them off. The
Iraqis said their own planes attacked two oil pumping stations near
Izeh in southwestern Iran and captured territory in the mountainous
northern border region.
   Wednesday was the anniversary of the adoption last July of
Resolution 598, which provides for an immediate cease-fire,
withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders, prisoner
exchange and an investigation to determine who started the war.
   The Iraqis said soon afterward they would accept it if Iran did,
but the Iranians said no truce could take effect until Iraq was
branded the aggressor. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after
several border skirmishes.
   Perez de Cuellar said a team of 10-12 military officers from
U.N. Middle East operations would work out cease-fire details with
officials in Baghdad and Tehran and return in no moe than a week.
He did not announce their itinerary.
   After that, the secretary-general said, he will announce a
starting date ``promptly'' and set dates for troop withdrawal,
prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and the investigation of
responsibility for the war.
   When the cease-fire takes effect, Perez de Cuellar said, he will
send up to 250 military observers into the area to verify and
supervise the truce and withdrawal of military forces.
   He said the team leaving immediately would be from the U.N.
Truce Supervision Organization based in Jerusalem and led by Lt.
Gen. Martin Vadset, the group's chief of staff. A political
officer, whom he did not identify, is to join the group.
   Perez de Cuellar said he would continue separate negotiations in
New York with Iranian and Iraqi representatives.
   Asked about the Iraqi proposal for direct talks, he said: ``I
have no objection. I have a preference for direct negotiations.''
He noted that Resolution 598 calls for negotiations between the two
sides.
   Mahallati, the Iranian envoy, rejected direct talks in comments
to reporters. Another Iranian diplomat, Mohammad Javad Zarif, told
journalists his country will observe a cease-fire during the
technical team's visit and continue an informal cease-fire later if
Iraq does the same.
   Iraq's proposal for direct talks was contained in a letter to
Perez de Cuellar from Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   Aziz said it was necessary to test whether the Iranian
acceptance of the resolution ``is serious or tactical ... with
partial or temporary solutions instead of a comprehensive
solution.''
   The Iraqis have said Iran appears to be buying time to rebuild
its economy and army so it can resume the war.
   Another Iraqi proposal is that the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which
forms the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and is Iraq's
only sea outlet, be cleared under U.N. auspices.
   It forms the southern border between Iraq and Iran and where the
line lies is in dispute. Iraq launched the initial invasion of the
war across the Shatt, which now is clogged with mines and sunken
ships.
   In his letter, Aziz also said Iraq wants an immediate guarantee
of its right to free navigation in the Persian Gulf and insisted
that Iran stop attacking tankers and other ships of nations not
involved in the war.

   A strong earthquake centered off the coast
of eastern Taiwan jolted the island Thursday morning. There were no
immediate reports of casulties or damage, the Central Weather
Bureau said.
   The earthquake struck at 7:15 a.m. (7:15 p.m. EDT Wednesday) and
registered a preliminary 6.4 magnitude reading on the open-ended
Richter scale, the bureau said. The epicenter was at sea 19 miles
southeast of the coastal city of Hualien in eastern Taiwan.
   The tremor was felt in the capital, where residents reported
their houses shook violently, the bureau said.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a 10-fold increase
in intensity.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area. An earthquake of magnitude 7 is a major tremor
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by William
Winpisinger, president of the International Association of
Machinists, nominating Jesse Jackson for president at the
Democratic National Convention Wednesday night.
   It is with a sense of a singular honor and consummate humility
that I stand before you tonight to place in nomination the name of
that one person in this vast nation of ours who has roused the
moral conscience of the populace and our party.
   The man who has shown us the way to thaw the ice of
indifference, smug self-satisfaction and meanness that too long has
masked the heartbeat of America.
   The man who has ignited the fires of passion, the fires of
justice in our souls as no other contemporary has.
   The man who has dared to sound our call to greatness.
   He has brought us together here in the phoenix of Atlanta _ amid
the smouldering ruins of two decades of defeat _ challenging the
Democratic Party to reclaim its heritage and rainbow identity.
   He has brought us together on the common ground of conscience,
passion, equality, justice _ economic, political and social justice
for all.
   He is the personification of feeling and reason united.
   For him the struggle began the day he was born in the poverty of
a small South Carolina community, nearly 46 years ago.
   From that day onward, he has been dedicated to shouldering aside
the four horsemen of the Apocalypse. He has seized history by the
mane and he is in the process of helping us _ leading us _ as we
write a new chapter, not only in the annals of American history,
but in the chronicles of humankind's long and torturous progress
toward peace and prosperity for all in a global community.
   Look what this man has accomplished in a few short years.

   Michael S. Dukakis and his family watched on
television from their hotel room as he was nominated for president
Wednesday night, and then awaited the roll call that would award
him the Democratic prize.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, declaring Dukakis has ``the
character, the record and the vision'' to be president, formally
nominated his friend and fellow Democratic governor in a speech to
delegates at the Democratic National Convention.
   ``He hasn't just played with issues, he's wrestled them to the
ground,'' said Clinton.
   Dukakis had the delegate strength to assure his nomination on
the traditional roll call of the states.
   ``I'm a very lucky guy,'' Dukakis said during a surprise
appearance at a luncheon honoring his wife, Kitty.
   He recalled how, when he and his wife arrived in the convention
city Sunday, he turned to her and said, ``I think it's for real.''
   Also on his schedule for the day of his nomination were a check
of the podium from which he will deliver his acceptance speech
Thursday, a discussion of drugs with children, a luncheon at the
Georgia governor's mansion and a meeting with his only remaining
rival, Jesse Jackson.
   Nineteen Democratic governors, including the host, Gov. Joe
Frank Harris of Georgia, attended the luncheon. Among those who
couldn't be there was Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who was to
deliver the speech placing Dukakis in nomination. Clinton's wife,
Hilary, attended the lunch.
   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, said the meeting with
Jackson was at Dukakis' request and was to discuss Jackson's role
in the fall campaign against Vice President George Bush, the
Republican nominee-to-be.
   After the meeting, Jackson said it was ``a get-acquainted
session for staff and key policy advisers, most of whom do not know
each other, but now must work together since we are in the same
boat with a common objective _ that is, to win in November.''
   Dukakis began his day of triumph with a telephone call to
Jackson to congratulate him on his speech to the convention Tuesday
night.
   He told the luncheon that, ``I thought when I watched Jesse
Jackson and I watched those five incredible kids of his ... how
lucky we are for the families we have.''
   Aides said Dukakis told Jackson he thought his speech was
``terrific.''
   The Kitty Dukakis luncheon was under way in the Fox Theater in
downtown Atlanta when her husband showed up.
   Mrs. Dukakis looked genuinely surprised when he walked on stage.
She turned to him and the couple hugged.
   ``I don't have to tell you, I'm blessed with a wonderful,
wonderful spouse,'' he told the crowd.
   He joked about how many people told him they supported him for
president, but liked her better.
   He said a woman in North Carolina told him she had his support
``because your wife smokes,'' a habit of which the governor openly
disapproves.
   He added, ``I don't have to tell you what kind of first lady
she's going to be _ a non-smoking first lady.''
   Standing in shortsleeves in the dusty playground of the Conyers
and Gwinett County Boys Club, Dukakis told children ranging from
elementary school to high school age that ``I don't have to tell
any of you, one of the most serious problems we face is drug and
alcohol abuse.''
   Mrs. Dukakis told the children of her 26-year addiction to diet
pills, which she started taking on the advice of a physician.
   ``The words I want to say to you are, `Don't start,''' she said.
   When the Boys Club official who introduced Dukakis thanked the
governor for taking time away from his busy schedule, Dukakis
responded, ``The problem with being a candidate is they never let
you out of the hotel room. So this is a joy to me.''

   He has forced new issues, and new ways of thinking about old
issues, into public view and the political dialogue.
   He rejects economic violence in favor of an economic bill of
rights for all, not just the privileged few.
   He condemns corporate merger maniacs and extols the virtues of
corporate accountability and responsibility not only into the
community, but the nation as well.
   He champions worker rights as an individual human right.
   He would replace wage discrimination with comparable worth.
   He sees collective bargaining as indispensable to industrial
democracy.
   His brilliant industrial policy _ both domestic and global in
purpose and vision _ includes a fair labor standards policy.
   And not since Hubert H. Humphrey has a presidential candidate
elevated the aspirations of workers and championed their quest for
worker rights to such heights in the mainstream of the political
dialogue.
   I have personally witnessed his intelligence, his skills, his
courage in confronting the challenge of labor and corporate
conflict.
   He was there in Wisconsin at Cudahy with the packinghouse
workers.
   And he was there with the members of my own union at Rome Cable
in the bitter cold of an early upstate New York winter.
   He has supported the struggle of Eastern Airline workers against
Texas Air and Frank Lorenzo.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Senator Scores GOP on Ethics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. John Kerry condemned the ``moral darkness of
the Reagan-Bush administration'' Wednesday and told delegates to
the Democratic National Convention it was time for ``a government
of laws and not of law-breakers.''
   Kerry, a freshman senator from Massachusetts, the home state of
Michael Dukakis, promised that in a Dukakis administration, ``the
government that makes the laws will not break the law.
   ``And in the America of Jesse Jackson,'' he said, ``the
government that says no to drugs will not say yes to General
Noriega.''
   ``It is time that we once again had a government of laws and not
of law-breakers. It's time we had an attorney general of the United
States who is an agent of justice and not the target of criminal
investigation,'' Kerry declared.
   The liberal Democrat raised the ethics issue two days after a
special prosecutor released a long-awaited report on Attorney
General Edwin Meese III saying the nation's top law enforcement
official ``probably'' violated federal law in his personal finances
but committed no crimes in the Wedtech scandal.
   Kerry also scored the Reagan administration _ and, by
implication, Vice President Bush _ for allowing a ``two-bit
dictator'' like Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega to peddle drugs, for
planning an ``illegal war'' in Central America and for plotting to
sell arms to Iran.
   Kerry made no mention of ethical questions encountered by some
prominent Democrats. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Dukakis' choice
for a running mate, backed off a plan to invite lobbyists to pay
$10,000 each to have breakfast with him. And House Speaker Jim
Wright is under scrutiny by the House Ethics Committee because of
questions about royalties on a book.
   The invitation to speak on ethics was a political plum for
Kerry, who served as lieutenant governor under Dukakis until his
election to the Senate in 1984. Kerry, 44, now chairs the
Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, the party's fund-raising arm
for the 1988 Senate races.
   Kerry was originally to have delivered the speech Tuesday night,
but the proceedings were running late and so it was rescheduled for
Wednesday.

   Here is the text of the second nominating speech
of Jesse Jackson delivered by Olga Mendez to the Democratic
National Convention Wednesday night.
   I have a job to do and a very pleasant one.
   I am Olga Mendez from New York.
   
   Saludos carinosos a todos los puertorriquenos donde quiera que
esten. A los dominicanos, cubanos y a mis hermanos en idioma y
cultura.
   (A lovely salute to all the Puerto Ricans, wherever they might
be. To the Dominicans, Cubans and to my brethren in language and
culture.)
   
   
   Mister chairman, my fellow Americans, my dear delegates,
   It is an honor to me this evening, an honor for me this evening,
to second the nomination of the Rev. Jesse Louis Jackson for
president of the United States of America.
   This _ this _ is doubly historic for me, when the first Puerto
Rican woman in the state of New York in the Senate can rise to
seconding nomination of the first black American man for the
highest position in the town.
   Coalition-building is the order of the day when I say to you:
America needs Jesse Jackson, and Jesse Jackson is good for America.
Historically, all our great leaders have had a vision as to where
the nation should go. Jesse Jackson understands the realities of
the 1980's. He has a vision of an America where no man, woman or
child is ever, is ever denied the constitutional rights because of
racial, cultural, linguistic, physical, economic or religious
differences.
   His vision encompasses all of us.
   We Puerto Ricans and Latino Americans are too often not
perceived as citizens because of differences in culture and
language. Jesse Jackson understands our reality. He includes us in
a common effort to eliminate poverty and ignorance.
   America needs Jesse Jackson, and Jesse Jackson is good for
America.
   Jesse Jackson is the most qualified person to spearhead the
completion of this unfinished agenda. He'll assure that all patches
of the American quilt are respected, kept in good repair and united
in a powerful unity.
   In his administration, the word ``American'' will mean all that
it was supposed to mean.
   America needs Jesse Jackson, and Jesse Jackson is good for
America.
   As president, Jesse will move this nation to greater heights, to
economic common ground based on respect for our differences, and
enjoyment of our similarities.
   My fellow Americans, my fellow Democrats, after long years _
eight years _ of the most corrupted Republican administration in
history, now, more than ever, Jesse Jackson is good for America.
   He is good for America.
   Jesse Jackson for president of the United States!

   This man knows what justice on the job means. He has long
recognized that without equal economic opportunity and economic
rights, there can be no real political democracy.
   No real freedom.
   And, yes, this man is a man of history _ a mover and shaker in
the power struggles of freedom and tyranny _ of democracy and
autocracy.
   The poet Langston Hughes long ago said it for us all. And I
quote him now:
   
   A long time ago,
   An enslaved people heading toward freedom
   Made up a song:
   Keep your hand on the plow! Hold on!
   That plow plowed a new furrow
   Across the field of history
   Into that furrow the freedom seed was dropped
   From that seed a tree grew, is growing,
   Will ever grow.
   That tree is for everybody,
   For all America, for all the world.
   May its branches spread and its shelter grow
   Until all races and all peoples know its shade.
   Keep your hands on the plow! Hold on!
   
   Any American worker _ blue collar, gray collar, pink collar or
white collar _ who has been displaced or dispossessed of his or her
job, who has been subjugated to a master-slave relationship by
corporate arrogance and profits without production _ can identify
with Langston Hughes and freedom's plow.
   And it well may be today's unreported and untold story, but the
man I'm about to nominate has been telling it like it is.
   And I am inordinately proud and uniquely privileged to offer in
nomination for the office of president of the United States, Jesse
Louis Jackson.

   Here is a transcript of the speech by Arkansas
Gov. Bill Clinton nominating Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for
president at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday night.
   I'm honored to be here tonight to nominate my friend Michael
Dukakis for president of the United States.
   We, as Americans, have a lot riding on this election.
   We face big challenges.
   Big problems.
   Big opportunities.
   The fundamental fact of 1988 is that we can't take our
prosperity for granted anymore in this competitive world economy.
   We've got to work harder and smarter to preserve the American
dream.
   And that means we need new economic policies and new people
policies.
   And that means we need new leadership to take us where we need
to go.
   Michael Dukakis can provide that leadership.
   Tonight, I want to talk about what where Governor Dukakis wants
to take this country, what he wants us to do.
   And I'd like to talk a little about Mike Dukakis, the man.
   He's come so far, so fast that all over this country of ours
people are asking questions: What kind of man is he, what kind of
governor has he been, what kind of president will he be.
   He's been my friend a long time.
   And I'd like to tell you my answers to those questions. I'd also
like to tell you why I believe Michael Dukakis should be the first
American president born of immigrant parents since Andrew Jackson.

   Here is the text of the second nominating speech
of Jesse Jackson delivered by Maxine Waters to the Democratic
National Convention Wednesday night.
   Last evening, Jesse Jackson electrified this convention with a
message that gave honor to us all. He told us his name would be
placed in nomination tonight for the presidency of the United
States of America.
   He also said, when he is nominated, you all are nominated.
   Tonight, I'm proud to second the nomination of Jesse Louis
Jackson and, in doing so, we're all indeed nominated. My mother and
my twelve brothers and sisters are proud tonight. My mother knows
why Jesse Jackson's candidacy is so important to me. She
understands why the long hours do not tire me. And she understands
why the setbacks do not discourage me.
   Jesse Jackson is her children's future and my children's future
and my grandchildren's future.
   Young people in Watts, Calif., you must know now that someone
really does care about you and wants you to live and to realize
your full potential as human beings. Working men and women, your
issues and your concerns have not been forgotten. Young girls and
women of this nation, you must know that we're all moving closer to
our goals for justice and equality.
   As his name goes into nomination, so does yours. For this one
man's message has transformed a nation. We will never again be the
same.
   For we have all been deeply touched by his message. One man's
vision has helped us to dream bigger dreams, climb higher
mountains, set new goals and redefine possibilities.
   One man's mission has mobilized and engaged a new voter,
energized the apathetic and set in motion a whole new generation.
One man's morality has brought us clarity and helped us to
understand what we really can be as a people.
   One man's courage has defied the odds and carried over 1,200 new
participants to this convention this night with a new spirit to
keep hope alive.
   Ladies and gentlemen, this one man that I speak of is a leader
of leaders. This one man that I speak of put the `q' in the word
`qualified.' For he is indeed qualified.
   This one man that we nominate tonight, this one man will one
day, one way, this one man will be the president of the United
States of America!
   Ladies and gentlemen, because of this one man, I second your
nomination and I second his nomination.
   Ladies and gentlemen, Rev. Jesse Louis Jackson!

   Authorities closed the overcrowded Omni
convention arena for the second straight night Wednesday as
Democrats prepared to nominate Michael Dukakis as their 1988
presidential candidate.
   ``This building has been closed by order of the fire marshal,''
state police Officer L.J. Robinson announced at 9:03 p.m. More than
a dozen police officers stood in front of one entrance to enforce
the closure.
   The Democratic National Committee said in a statement that it
concurred with the decision ``in the interest of safety of all
those in the hall.''
   Several delegates were caught outside the hall, including Ann
Richards, the Texas state treasurer who delivered the convention's
keynote speech Monday night, and some members of Congress: Reps.
Peter Rodino of New Jersey, and Les Aspin and Gerald Kleczka of
Wisconsin.
   ``There was no hassle at all,'' said Ms. Richards. ``I came late
and the hall was full. No they'll do the count, and we'll see what
we'll see. If I don't get in, we'll watch it on television.''
   ``It's a little bit of a consternation,'' said Rodino.
Chuckling, he added, ``And I'm a super delegate.''
   Aspin said being kept out of the hall was ``no big deal. I
wouldn't worry about it. I think Dukakis will make it without me.''
   Kleczka commented, ``I'm not upset, but we're going to have to
talk to a supervisor here because I'm an at-large delegate and an
alternate can't vote for me. If I don't get in, Wisconsin is one
vote short.''
   Also caught on the outside were Bert Lance and his wife,
LaBelle, and former Wisconsin Gov. Pat Lucey. Lance, who was
director of the Office of Management and Budget under President
Carter, has been a key adviser to Jesse Jackson in this year's
campaign
   ``If Pete Rodino and Les Aspin are on the outside, I'm with
them,'' Lance said.
   A delegate walking by him muttered, ``If he can't get in, nobody
can.'' The delegate declined to give her name.
   Rep. Robert Garcia of New York said he barely made it into the
hall, but that a number of his colleagues did not, including Sen.
J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and Reps. Paul Kanjorski of
Pennsylvania, Jim Slattery of Kansas and Brian Donnelly of
Masssachusetts.
   Although there were some chants at one gate of ``Let the
delegates in'' and ``We shall overcome,'' the mood generally was
good-natured, unlike Tuesday night when some tempers had flared.
   Mrs. Lance spent the time outdoors buying a convention button
from a vendor.
   The vendor, Tony Lyons, said, ``It's a great tribute to the
Democratic process that senators and congressmen are waiting out
here with the common man.''
   Atlanta Fire Chief William H. Hamer had said earlier Wednesday
that officials would not hesitate to seal the Democratic convention
arena again if it were crowded beyond capacity.
   Democratic National Committee officials said Wednesday night
that they had two counters at each entrance to monitor the flow of
traffic in and out of the building.
   Up to 1,000 angry convention-goers confronted security officials
Tuesday night when The Omni reached capacity just before Jesse
Jackson's speech, spurring fire officials to seal the building.
   Asked about the potential of closing the hall again during
Wednesday's session, Hamer was clear that he wouldn't hesitate to
do so.
   ``We have to, that's the law. ... The only thing we're going to
do is basically the same thing,'' Hamer said. ``We will try to be
as lenient as possible and as flexible as we can, but it's a matter
of life and death.''
   The interior of the convention hall was redesigned to present a
more pleasing television appearance. Seating was reduced to an
estimated 11,000. Hamer said that number can be expanded to about
12,500.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young blamed much of the overcrowding on
the hordes of journalists in the hall. Most news organizations have
their working areas at the adjacent Georgia World Congress Center.
   ``What we had was a lot of people (reporters) who normally would
be working in the Georgia World Congress Center or would be on
assignment in other places deciding that that (The Omni) was the
place they wanted to be last night,'' he said.

   A riot broke out in Michoacan state
penitentiary Wednesday and officials said at least 10 people were
killed and 15 injured before it was brought under control. One
report said 14 people died.
   A preliminary report by the state government described the
violence at the prison in Morelia, the state capital, as ``an
attempt at a mass breakout.''
   The prison houses about 2,000 prisoners, but it was not
immediately clear how many took part in the riot.
   ``It's still very hot,'' the duty officer at the state judicial
police said by phone from Morelia, 150 miles west of Mexico City.
He refused to give his name and said no details were available.
   However, Andres Rencillas Mejia, news editor for La Voz de
Michoacan newspaper, said in a phone interview that his reporters
confirmed 11 people died and 18 were wounded in a one-hour shootout
between prisoners and guards.
   He said prisoners destroyed virtually all files of pending court
cases. The penitentiary includes six state courtrooms.
   The national news service of the Excelsior newspaper said state
Attorney General Jose Franco Villa provided casualty figures of 14
guards and prisoners killed and 20 wounded.
   The government figures of 10 killed and about 15 hurt came from
Isauro Gutierrez, chief of the social work office at the Michoacan
state attorney general's office.
   Alfredo Gonzalez, an aide in state government's information
office, said the riot ``already has been controlled.''
   All state officials reached said detailed reports were not yet
available.
   The Excelsior report from Morelia said all inmates were taken to
holding areas in the prison yards while their cells were searched
and that at least 30 weapons were found.
   The riot started at about 10 a.m. _ noon EDT _ according to all
accounts.
   Excelsior's account quoted Franco Villa as saying the riot began
when two prisoners being taken to trial disarmed their guards, that
other prisoners seized advantage of the situation to join in and
disarm other guards, and that a shootout started between prisoners
and watchtower guards.
   The report said prisoners held 15 secretaries and eight nurses
hostage while the shootout lasted.

<HEAD>Seven Civilians, 11 Rebels Reported Killed In Nicaraguan Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODOLFO GARCIA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry said Wednesday
that 11 rebels and seven civilians were killed in attacks this week
which violated a cease-fire between the Contras and the leftist
Sandinista government.
   Also Wednesday, Foreign Ministry representatives requested a
visa for Ambassador Carlos Tunnerman to travel to the United
States, days after the Reagan administration expelled him. He
returned from Washington Saturday.
   A ministry statement said seven civilians died, including two
children aged 7 and 9, and five were wounded Tuesday when a rebel
band ambushed two vehicles in which the victims were riding near
Juigalpa, 55 miles east of Managua.
   It said nine rebels were killed Monday when Sandinista troops
fought off their attack near Muelle de los Bueyes and Muhan,
neighboring villages in southern Nicaragua near the Caribbean coast.
   The statement gave no details and made no mention of government
casualties.
   It said two rebels were killed and one was wounded in an attack
Tuesday on troops near San Rafael del Norte, 110 miles north of the
capital city of Managua. It said the troops repelled the attack by
the U.S.-supported rebels.
   President Daniel Ortega announced on Tuesday that his government
was unilaterally extending to Aug. 30 a cease-fire scheduled to
expire at the end of July.
   The Contras have not said if they will agree to the extension.
   Both sides have charged frequent violations in the cease-fire
that began March 21 and has been extended repeatedly. No talks have
been scheduled to negotiate a lasting peace agreement since the
last round broke off in June.
   State-run radio Voice of Nicaragua said Tunnerman needed to
travel to the United States to take part in an international
education contest and functions related to his job as ambassador to
the Organization of American States.
   U.S. Embassy officials refused to comment Wednesday night.
   The United States on July 11 ordered Tunnerman and seven other
Nicaraguan diplomats to leave, in retaliation for Nicaragua's
expulsion of U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven American
diplomats.
   The U.S. Embassy stopped issuing tourist visas to Nicaraguans on
July 13, one day after Melton left, citing a shortage of personnel.
The measure does not affect diplomatic visas.
   Nicaragua argued that Tunnerman did not have to leave the United
States because he also represented his country in the OAS.
Tunnerman left Washington just ahead of a State Department deadline
for his departure, assailing his expulsion as ``unjustified and
illegal.''
   The OAS charter says attendance at OAS meetings shall ``not
depend on bilateral relations'' between any member state and the
United States, the host country.
   But the Reagan administration said a separate agreement between
the United States and the OAS authorizes the U.S. government to
order any OAS diplomat home.
   An Interior Department spokeswoman said Wednesday in another
development that 40 people arrested for an anti-government
demonstration on July 10 will be tried in criminal courts on
charges of criminal association and causing injury.
   Patricia Orozco, director of the department's press office, said
evidence would be presented Thursday.
   Special police courts earlier revoked the maximum six-month
sentences they imposed in 36 of the cases last week so the cases
could be transferred to criminal court.
   Human rights groups have described the police courts as
arbitrary and unconstitutional.
   Critics of the government had complained bitterly about the
sentences arising from the demonstration in Nandaime, a town 40
miles south of Managua. The Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinate, a
coalition of political parties, business and labor groups opposing
the Sandinistas, organized the demonstration.
   Fighting broke out between police and thousands of demonstrators.
   Among those arrested were Carlos Huembes, the coordinate's
president; Roger Guevara, its secretary; Miriam Arguello,
secretary-general of the Conservative Party, and Agustin Jarquin, a
leader of the Social Christian Party.
   The government closed down the Roman Catholic radio station and
suspended publication of the opposition newspaper La Prensa for 15
days for their reporting on the demonstration.

<HEAD>President Shakes Up Taiwan Cabinet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui announced a major
Cabinet shake-up Wednesday that suggested a gradual approach to
fulfilling his promise of further liberalizing Nationalist Party
rule over Taiwan.
   Lee kept Premier Yu Kuo-hwa, the government's leading
conservative, but brought eight new officials into the 25-member
Cabinet and transferred seven to new Cabinet posts. Several
reform-minded Nationalist lawmakers had called for Yu's resignation.
   The reshuffle came one week after the landmark 13th Nationalist
Party congress retired several Chiang Kai-shek era conservatives
while promoting a younger generation of party leaders, including
many native Taiwanese.
   The Nationalists, led by Chiang, set up their authoritarian
government in Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to communist
forces on the Chinese mainland. Those born on the mainland have
long dominated the party's top ranks although native Taiwanese
comprise 85 percent of the island's nearly 20 million people.
   Lee, a 65-year-old native Taiwanese, was acclaimed Nationalist
chairman by the party congress July 8. He received approval for the
new Cabinet at a Wednesday meeting of the party's policy-making
Central Standing Committee. Officials said the changes take effect
next Monday.
   The average age of the Cabinet fell from 62 to 58 and the number
of native Taiwanese rose from eight to 11 as they picked up the key
posts of foreign minister and finance minister.
   Shirley Kuo, 58, deputy governor of the Central Bank, becomes
the first woman minister as head of the Finance Ministry, replacing
Robert Chien, 59, named the Cabinet's secretary-general.
   Lee has pledged to continue democratic reform and other
liberalization begun by his predecessor Chiang Ching-kuo, the
eldest son of Chiang kai-shek.
   Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law and ended a ban on
opposition parties in the months before his death Jan. 13.
   Many of the new Cabinet members are viewed as technocrats,
including several groomed by Yu and other party conservatives from
mainland China. But some observers believe the new line-up should
speed liberalization of the state-dominated economic system.
   Lin An-lo, chief economist at the Chunghwa Institute for
Economic Research, said, ``Premier Yu has been under tremendous
pressure to reform. We hope he can do better with the cooperation
of the younger Cabinet members.''
   Lee called for reform of the economic and financial system, but
economists say the government has moved slowly so as not to
irritate powerful vested interests.
   The party controls Taiwan's banks and many other large
enterprises. Conservative party members generally oppose
privatization of banks and other businesses and reform of the tax
system, steps many people say are needed to modernize the economy.
   Vice Premier Lien Chan, 52, replaces 64-year-old Ding Mou-shih
as foreign minister.
   Frederick Chien, 54, Taiwan's representative in Washington,
replaces Chao Yao-tung, 73, as head of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development.
   Chen Li-an, 51, chairman of the National Science Council,
replaces 69-year-old Lee Ta-hai as economic affairs minister.
   The youngest Cabinet member is Ma Ying-jeou, 38, appointed head
of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission.
   Lee also said Wednesday that parliamentary reforms should be
implemented this year to ``make us more fit for constitutional
democracy.''
   Taiwan's parliamentary bodies are now dominated by aging
Nationalists elected on the Chinese mainland before 1949 and frozen
in office to support the Nationalists' claim to be the rightful
ruler of all China.
   The Nationalist Party proposed increasing the number of locally
elected seats while allowing aging mainlanders to retire.
   But the opposition Democratic Progressive Party wants all seats
in the Legislative Yuan, the highest lawmaking body, and the
National Assembly electoral college to be contested in next year's
elections.

   They are here with brave faces and dashed hopes,
listening to speeches they hoped to make, watching the coronation
they fought for. They are the also-rans of 1988, and they had other
plans for this week.
   ``Obviously there are mixed feelings,'' said Sen. Paul Simon of
Illinois, who gave up his Democratic primary campaign April 7 after
washing out in Wisconsin. ``You'd like to be where Mike is.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis is a day away from the victory speech that
will cap his long fight for the party's nomination. A year ago he
was with the rest of them: scrabbling for serious attention,
ridiculed for lacking stature.
   He gained both by outlasting his opponents, and all but one were
on hand to see him claim the spoils. They did so ungrudgingly, most
with expressions of support but with a tinge of wistfulness at what
might have been.

   When Geraldine Ferraro strode to the podium at
the Democratic National Convention four years ago, there was
rejoicing that a woman had finally demolished a historic barrier
and joined the ticket of a major U.S. political party.
   But that was then and this was now.
   Women are insiders _ not outsiders _ at the 1988 convention.
   They're no longer toasting their triumphs and spoiling for new
battles. They're down in the political trenches alongside men,
taking quiet satisfaction at the thought that the Democrats are
about to nominate a presidential candidate _ Michael Dukakis _ who
supports them on most issues.

   Wildfires in northern Alaska have
burned an area the size of Rhode Island and then some, but most
people are oblivious to the blazes as the 49th state weathers its
worst fire season in 10 years.
   In far-reaching Alaska, 1,300 square miles of burned acreage is
like a postage stamp on a parcel. Here stories of firefighting
drama are rare; the terrain is flatter and less rocky, and the days
longer, than in other wildfire states.
   ``We don't have snakes, we don't have darkness,'' said Bill
Robertson, an Alaska Fire Service spokesman. ``We have crews that
go down to the Lower 48 and are amazed.''
   Fifty wildfires, one of them burning since April 16, continued
to burn today in Alaska's interior. The Alaska Fire Service manned
about one-third and monitored the others.

   Engineers are trying to fix a tiny
gas leak in the space shuttle, but there's a 50-50 chance Discovery
will have to be rolled back from the launch pad to a hangar for
repairs, says Kennedy Space Center's director.
   Taking Discovery off the pad would delay the first launch since
the Challenger disaster, now scheduled for early September, by up
to two months, Forrest S. McCartney told reporters Tuesday.
   ``We wish we had found it (the leak) earlier,'' McCartney said.
``If we had found it when it was accessible, there would have been
no problem. But it's in an inaccessible place, and we don't know
what we're going to do about it.
   ``We've got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to do.
Whatever course we take there will be no compromise in flight
safety.
   ``The odds are 50-50 on a rollback,'' McCartney said.

   With Franklin-like frugality and
inventiveness, the state will convert the concrete roadbed slabs of
the Benjamin Franklin Bridge that opened 62 years ago into an
undersea home for lobsters and sea bass.
   The 6,000 slabs removed in the $70 million resurfacing of the
bridge are being dumped into the Atlantic Ocean to form an
artificial reef 5 feet high, the size of five football fields.
   ``Ben was for anything innovative. He would have liked this idea
_ you know, a penny saved is a penny earned,'' said Bill Lynch, a
spokesman for the Delaware River Port Authority, which operates the
bridge between Camden and Philadelphia.
   ``I don't know how much they saved, but I bet it was more than a
penny,'' said Bill Figley of the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, who is overseeing the construction of the
state's largest artificial reef.
   The Port Authority is paying a contractor $1.6 million to barge
the slabs out to sea eight miles off Cape May, Lynch said. Bids for
landfill disposal of the slabs went as high as $3 million.

   What's the best thing about a political
convention? Not the drama (certainly not this week). Not the food
(check back next month, after New Orleans). It's the shameless
rhetorical excess!
   And all of it this week directed at one man. The man with one
name. George.
   Poor George, that toothache of a man, that hear-nothing,
see-nothing, do-nothing vice president. A man, it has now been
said, ``too squeamish to bait his own hook.''
   In a spirit of generosity, the Democrats sometimes give George
more than one name. They give him the four he was born with, as in
George Herbert Walker Bush ``of the Kennebunkport Bushes.''
   Bush is the target of this attention by virtue of the fact that
he is to be nominated next month by the Republicans to stand
against Michael Dukakis, a Democrat about whom not one humorous
thing has been said this week at his convention in Atlanta.

   For a host of up-and-coming Democrats who aren't
named Dukakis or Jackson, the party convention provides a stage for
them to strut their stuff and dream of bigger days to come.
   Among the rising stars who got to perform before the crowd of
11,000 in The Omni and millions more watching on television:
Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, selected to nominate Michael Dukakis on
Wednesday night, and Texas Treasurer Ann W. Richards, who skewered
George Bush in her folksy keynote address Monday.
   Each harbors higher ambitions, Clinton to run for president
himself one day, and Richards to become governor of the Lone Star
state in 1990.
   Others play out bit roles at the 40th Democratic National
Convention, often making their entrance when the cameras of the
national television networks are dark, or turned the other way.
   But for young politicians like Louisiana State Sen. Cleo Fields,
who is all of 25, and Texas State Rep. Lena Guerrero, 30, just
getting to the rostrum was a sign that somebody in the party
hierarchy liked them.

   The senator was pelted with questions: What was
he doing at the convention? How did his speech go the night before?
How would Michael Dukakis handle rural issues? And would Iowa
retain its first-in-the-nation presidential primary contest?
   Not exactly network fare.
   But it's the kind of interview that's going on dozens of times a
day at the Convention Satellite News Service, the Democratic
Party's equal-opportunity showcase for TV stations too poor to come
to the convention and politicians unlikely to show up on the
network evening news.
   The Convention Satellite News Service, with 46 hours of
transmissions scheduled during convention week, is costing about
$300,000 _ all of it paid for by congressional campaign
organizations and associations of Democratic governors, mayors and
state party chairs.

   The Reagan administration welcomed on
Wednesday a Soviet offer to dismantle the disputed Krasnoyarsk
radar complex in Siberia, but spurned Moscow's attempt to link the
proposal with other arms control squabbles.
   As a result, the two sides still seemed far apart in their
interpretations of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, which
limits radar installations as well as various tests for a ``Star
Wars'' defense against Soviet rockets.
   ``The Soviets should comply with their ABM treaty obligations by
dismantling the radar without delay and without conditions,''
Phyllis Oakley, a State Department spokeswoman, said. ``I am not
going to discuss the merits of conditions.''
   She reiterated President Reagan's contention, which has wide
support even among critics of his arms control policy, that the
phased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk was in conflict with the 1972
treaty.

   While a grand jury met Wednesday to hear
more evidence in the Pentagon bribery case, a federal judge refused
a newspaper's request that he unseal information filed by
investigators to obtain search warrants against their prospective
targets.
   U.S. District Judge Claude A. Hilton said that public release of
the affidavits would ``harm the process' of the investigation. The
contested material triggered the authorization, by various courts,
of dozens of searches by federal agents around the country on June
14.
   Meanwhile, the grand jury met for a second day to hear from the
Justice Department team which has coordinated the massive,
2-year-old investigation, which came to public light only when the
searches got under way.

   Growth in personal income slowed in all but
three states during the first three months of 1988, barely keeping
ahead of inflation, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said growth in income in the 50 states
and the District of Columbia slowed to 0.8 percent in the
January-March period, compared with growth of 2.8 percent in the
final quarter of 1987.
   Despite the slowdown, incomes managed to stay slightly ahead of
the increase in prices, which was 0.6 percent in the first quarter
for personal consumption spending.
   Income in the 12 months ending March 31 expanded by 6.3 percent,
while inflation was 3.8 percent.

   An unpublished memo written by the head of the
Food and Drug Administration shows the agency wants to reject
proposals for broader limitations on sulfite food preservatives,
despite estimates that the chemicals can be extremely dangerous to
a million or more Americans.
   A consumer health group said Wednesday the FDA's failure to act
endangers many asthmatics and others who have a severe reaction to
sulfites, including the possibility of death within hours after
food containing the chemicals is eaten.
   Sulfites, which have been used for decades to prevent
discoloration in food, have been banned since 1986 for use on fresh
fruits and vegetables, such as those sold in salad bars. Fresh
potatoes have been exempted from the ban, but will be included
later this year, FDA officials say.

   A new, harder line shift in the
leadership of the Nicaraguan Contras and a resulting split with
their so-called ``Southern Front'' could be politically costly to
the anti-Sandinista rebels.
   The alliance between the Southern Front and the principal Contra
coalition known as the Nicaraguan Resistance has always been
fragile, marred by frequent disputes and an almost constant lack of
cooperation.
   But the announcement of a break in that alliance Tuesday night
by seven Southern Front field commanders highlighted anew the
growing turmoil within the Contra organization brought about by
last year's congressional decision to end U.S. aid.

   U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi is a ``a thug in a
congressman's suit,'' a prosecutor said Wednesday in closing
arguments at the Wedtech corruption trial.
   During a summation expected to last two days, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Edward J. Little said Biaggi extorted nearly $4 million in
Wedtech stock in exchange for helping the company secure defense
contracts.
   ``We're talking about official extortion,'' said Little.
``Congressmen don't need guns. Their office is their weapon.''
   Biaggi, 70, a 10-term New York Democrat; his eldest son,
Richard; former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon; and four
others are charged with turning Wedtech into a racketeering
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain
no-bid defense contracts.

   The Hoover Institution, the think-tank
that generated many of the Reagan administration's conservative
ideas, must pick a new leader of its own following a decision by
its long-time director to step down.
   W. Glenn Campbell's decision follows months of debate about the
affiliation between Stanford University and the on-campus
institution that will soon be home to Secretary of State George
Shultz and Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Campbell, who succeeded founder and former President Herbert
Hoover in 1960, said the new director will have to ``be a leader
who can provide a climate where all these prima donnas can live
together.''
   The announcement came two months after Campbell vowed to sue if
Stanford tried to oust him at 65 because it was the customary
retirement age at the university. Campbell had planned on staying
another five years.

<HEAD>It's the Boot for Illegal Parkers in London</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's pert, uniformed meter maids, made famous
by a Beatles song about a lovely one called Rita, are being
upstaged by the dreaded ``Denver Boot.''
   Scotland Yard's zealous _ some say overzealous _ attack on
illegally parked cars has turned London into the world's
car-clamping capital, and has prompted a storm of protests.
   The Denver Boot, developed in Colorado in the 1950s, fits over a
wheel, immobilizing a car until the driver pays a fee and a crew
comes to unlock it. That can take hours.
   The metropolitan police department decided to get tough 18
months ago when it ``privatized'' clamping by contracting the
practice to two private companies.
   Today, 22 squads, each consisting of a civilian clamper and a
police officer, prowl the inner-London boroughs of Westminster,
Kensington, Chelsea and Camden. They clamp 400 to 500 vehicles a
day and the civilian clampers get paid an undisclosed sum for each
one, which critics say encourages them to overclamp.
   ``London uses the clamp as an enforcement tool more than any
other city,'' said Scotland Yard Chief Inspector John Marle.
   Events like the Chelsea flower show and sales at Harrods
department store can prove bonanzas for clampers, who can
immobilize a car in seconds.
   The crackdown has proved a boon for some clever entrepreneurs
who have launched a whole new industry: commercial unclamping.
   Young men have formed squads of radio-carrying motorcycle riders
who, for a fee, will go pay the clamping fee.
   Parking has long been a problem in this puzzling city of
squares, alleys and culs-de-sac, where 350,000 cases of illegal
parking occur daily.
   ``The streets of London were being clogged with illegally parked
vehicles,'' Marle said, sounding very official. ``This prevented
vehicles from moving around the capital with ease.''
   Scotland Yard turned to clamping because ``all other methods
failed,'' Marle said.
   The high-profile clamp hasn't, and illegal parking has dropped
40 percent in certain areas, he said.
   Here are the gory details:
   After a driver gets over the shock of discovering that his car
has been clamped, he must go to one of three payment points in the
city and pay a $43 clamping fine, followed by a $20 parking fine.
   Then he must wait for an unclamping crew to arrive. Cars are
freed in order of fees paid, and crews themselves can get caught in
traffic.
   ``We would not expect anybody to wait more than four hours,''
the chief inspector said.
   Among the unclampers, the Car Clamp Recovery Club, which calls
itself the original and biggest, charges a $44 annual fee and $14
per job. For an additional, minimum $26, it will deliver a car to a
destination of the customer's choice.
   The critics claim clamping exacerbates the problem by cuffing
cars exactly where they don't belong.
   Mark Reed, a real estate agent, said persistent clamping forced
him to sell his agency and move. ``It's going to affect business in
a big way in central London,'' he said.
   Jacqueline Pruskin, who operates art galleries in Kensington and
Chelsea, said clamping hurts people, such as plumbers, whose
livelihood depends on mobility, as well as merchants, whose
customers are frightened off by the clamp threat.
   Fortunately, not too many drivers get violent about it.
   ``There's been an odd incident, but very odd,'' Marle said. He
conceded, however, ``There's a lot of verbal violence.''
   Reed freely admits to using strong language when he caught a
clamper crawling down the street trying to to clamp his car
unnoticed.
   ``I said, `This is a pretty right-wing sort of Nazi thing you're
doing,''' Reed recalled.
   Newspapers have reported clampers nabbing ambulances, tour
buses, disabled cars, a participant in a funeral procession and a
van bringing meals to the homeless.
   Marle calls the reports ``outrageous journalese,'' saying the
police don't clamp cars where it would be obstructive or dangerous.
Those vehicles, they remove.
   Clampers clamp only in cases authorized by the accompanying
police officers, he said.
   He added that Scotland Yard doesn't generally discuss individual
cases, but in the incident involving the van, he said, the driver
parked on the sidewalk _ a common London offense _ and was warned
repeatedly before being clamped.
   ``Genuine mistakes are sometimes made,'' he said, ``and we
correct them as fast as we can.''

<HEAD>Private Bookstore in Beijing Struggling to Stay Open</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just two months after it opened, a private
bookstore that specializes in translations of Western works is in
danger of closing _ a victim of the cold, hard world of economics.
   ``We've got problems. We owe everybody,'' said Liu Yuanshang, as
she sat recently in a cluttered storage hall behind her Three
Flavors Bookroom. ``But we have a lot of people supporting us so we
have hope.''
   Ms. Liu, 48, opened the store May 18 in a one-story wood and
stone house in western Beijing. Her husband, Li Shiqiang, 44, and
her former husband, Yu Chen, 58, are her main partners.
   Named after a short story by the famous early 20th-century
writer Lu Xun, Three Flavors is a special bookstore, filled with
Chinese-language books on American law, capitalist economics,
modern art and psychology.
   These subjects were taboo during China's ultraleftist Cultural
Revolution of 1966-76 and still are not completely accepted by the
state.
   ``We are a bookstore for intellectual adventurers,'' said Ms.
Liu. ``We want to help open the minds of the Chinese people.''
   Unlike government-run stores where books are locked in glass
cases, the Three Flavors puts its books on open shelves and
encourages customers to browse.
   One recent day, an elderly gentlemen in T-shirt and shorts sat
in a corner and fanned himself slowly, reading a Shakespeare play
in Chinese.
   Nearby a young woman sat at the edge of a red bench, lost in the
poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson.
   ``My school is very far away, but I often come here to read,''
said Li Yin, 18, looking up from her poems. ``It is wonderful to
read here because they make you feel at home.''
   Ms. Liu said she and her partners opened the store because they
were disgusted by the selection offered in other Beijing stores.
   ``Too many stores these days are selling bad books, just
designed for quick excitement. They're dirty books or detective
books,'' Ms. Liu said. ``But we want to sell books that will give
our readers more knowledge. China is backward and we need to learn
more.''
   The store had to be privately owned, said Ms. Liu, to be as free
as possible in the selection of stock.
   ``I didn't want anyone leading us around by the nose.''
   More than half the books are translations of Western books
recently published in China. On one shelf a collection by French
philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre sits next to ``Goodbye, Colombus'' by
Philip Roth. On another, Friedrich Nietzsche vies with ``The Agony
and the Ecstasy,'' Irving Stone's biography of Michaelangelo.
   Ms. Liu said she was branded a ``rightist'' at age 18 in 1958,
and was unable to get a job for 20 years.
   ``And after that the job I got was no good. They made me an
English teacher but I had forgotten all my English.''
   China's recent reforms, allowing limited private industry, gave
Ms. Liu a way out. She and her partners pooled their life savings
and last year bought the building for $21,000.
   ``Ah, what a mess it was,'' she recalled.
   Relatives and friends helped renovate the building for free, but
the new pipes, lights, roof and windows cost money.
   Ms. Liu and her partners raised some from friends. Then they
turned to a bank, but China's state-run banks are not accustomed to
floating loans to private enterprises.
   ``We were forced to borrow from private lenders at high
interest,'' she said.
   As of mid-July, the store was in debt $6,760.
   ``Everything you see in this room isn't really ours,'' Ms. Liu
said waving her hands at stacks and stacks of books. ``We still
have no money to pay.''
   But, she said, ``We have this house. And we have our friends.''

<HEAD>Phyllis Frelich Plays Sister Sarah on `Santa Barbara'</HEAD>

   Phyllis Frelich, the Tony Award-winning
actress from Broadway's ``Children of a Lesser God,'' has many of
the performers on the NBC daytime drama ``Santa Barbara'' learning
to use sign language for the deaf.
   Frelich has joined the show as Sister Sarah, a nun who might be
involved in a murder. In the story, Sarah has left the mission and
is living with Julia Wainwright, an attorney played by Nancy Grahn.
   ``All the actors I work with are learning to read and do
signs,'' she said. ``Nancy knew some signs so our scenes are
comfortable and easy.
   ``The way we work is that the other actors read my signs and
voice my thoughts. Last week we got a call from a viewer who said
the sign language was not accurate. I said, of course, someone who
is in stress and is with people learning to read signs will make
mistakes. It's quite realistic. People would also read the signs
wrong.''
   Frelich was interviewed with her husband, Bob Steinberg, an
actor and former lighting director, acting as her interpreter.
   ``Santa Barbara'' is the first soap opera appearance for
Frelich, who also starred in the Hallmark Hall of Fame production
``Love Is Never Silent.''
   ``It really happened in a funny way,'' she said. ``I met Nancy
Grahn at a benefit performance at Beyond Baroque of `A Night at the
Movies.' It was a whole evening of scenes and I did a scene from
`Network.' Nancy knew a few signs and said that during the writers
strike the actors were submitting ideas.
   ``We sat down and made up a story for us. Nancy took it to the
producers and said she had this terrific idea and that they should
put me on the show. But what they did was cast me as Sister Sarah.
She had previously been referred to on the show. They simply made
her deaf.
   ``In the show Julia and Sarah become good friends because Julia
has taken over investigation of the murder I'm involved in,'' she
said.
   ``The question is who murdered Mark McCormick. The murder, which
happened several years ago, has never been solved. Someone is
trying to frame Mason Capwell (Lane Davies). He's trying to find
out who framed him and I've been helping him.''
   Sarah was a troubled woman taken into the mission by Sister
Mary, who left the church and married McCormick.
   ``It looks as though Sarah knows who the killer is,'' said
Frelich. ``That's the way the story seems to be going. Sarah is
very confused, with two conflicting personalities. It's a
complicated part and it's difficult to know who she is.''
   Frelich became interested in acting while a student at Gallaudet
College, a school for the hearing-impaired in Washington, D.C. She
then joined the National Theatre for the Deaf. She starred as a
deaf playwright in ``The Hands of the Enemy'' at the Mark Taper
Forum in Los Angeles with Richard Dreyfuss.
   ``Acting is very difficult and jobs are scarce, even more so for
me than most actors,'' she said. ``I've been on the lecture
circuit, trying to make people aware and more sensitive to the
needs of deaf people. That keeps me busy between acting jobs.''
   She starred in the Broadway version of ``Children of a Lesser
God,'' which was written for her by playwright Mark Medoff. She had
met Medoff when her husband had been scenic and lighting designer
on several of his plays.
   ``I was the first deaf person he had known,'' she said. ``I told
him there were no roles for deaf actresses. He said, `OK, I'll
write a play for you.' He did. He went home and wrote `Children of
a Lesser God.' He wanted to write a good play. He was interested in
me as an actress and he wasn't trying to write a message play.''
   Frelich said it was hard for her to judge the movie version,
which won an Academy Award for deaf actress Marlee Matlin. ``It's
so hard because I see all the differences,'' she said. ``The
picture leaves you with a different feeling. I keep seeing what
isn't there.''
   She said Matlin came backstage to see her in New York. ``We had
lunch and talked a few times since.''
   Frelich was the oldest of nine deaf children born to deaf
parents in Devil's Lake, N.D. She has two teen-age sons, Reuben and
Joshua, who have normal hearing.

   Actresses Lauren Bacall, Betty Comden and
Phyllis Newman are among performers in the birthday bash being
thrown in August for conductor Leonard Bernstein at the music
center where he got his start.
   The Tanglewood Music Center also is celebrating the 50th
anniversary of its Music Shed this summer with a special concert by
the resident Boston Symphony Orchestra featuring the same music,
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, that inaugurated the building in 1938.
   The Bernstein weekend alone, with tickets as high as $5,000
each, may bring in more than $1 million for the festival's
endowment fund, according to Caroline Smedvig of the symphony.
   ``Because Tanglewood is so special for him and, conversely, he's
so special to us, the combination will produce what we hope will be
a unique event,'' she said.
   The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-day
affair beginning on the composer's 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise
money for the music center.
   Beverly Sills, who announced last month that she will step down
as general director of the New York City Opera, will be the host of
the event. Bacall and soprano Barbara Hendricks will perform a
movement from Bernstein's Symphony No. 3, ``Kaddish.'' Violin
soloist Midori will play two movements from his ``Serenade.''
   Dame Gwyneth Jones and Frederica von Stade will be among those
performing highlights from ``Fidelio'' and other works to honor
Bernstein's landmark opera recordings.
   The concert will also celebrate Bernstein's accomplishments in
popular music with excerpts from such works as ``West Side Story''
and ``On the Town.''
   The orchestra opened the nine-week season with the special July
1 concert marking the first half-century of the Music Shed.
   The season of classical music will be expanded with performances
by such popular rock, jazz and folk artists as The Beach Boys,
George Benson and Leo Kottke.
   But the highlight of the new season is the celebration of
Bernstein's birthday.
   The BSO is even billing the birthday party as ``one of the music
world's great occasions'' and is negotiating the television rights
in the United States and Europe.
   Among the conductor's friends who have been invited to the bash
are pop star Michael Jackson and British Princess Diana, although
Tanglewood officials say the have not yet received an answer from
the celebrities.
   Bernstein was a member of the original Tanglewood Music Center
class of 1940, where he became a protege of Tanglewood founder
Serge Koussevitzky.
   When Koussevitzky retired in 1949, he tried to have the young
Bernstein named as his successor, but the BSO's trustees chose
Charles Munch because they considered Bernstein too young and
tainted by popular music.
   He later wrote the score for the musical ``West Side Story'' and
returned every summer to conduct and teach.
   Conductors Seiji Ozawa, John Williams, John Mauceri and Michael
Tillson Thomas will share the poduim featuring some of his works on
the night of his birth.
   The following night, Ozawa and special guests will appear in a
Music Shed concert for a performance intended to show Bernstein's
influence on other musicians.
   Aug. 27 will be given over to a performance of Bernstein's
``Mass'' by a 250-member troupe from the Indiana University school
of music.
   The four-day celebration concludes with Bernstein conducting the
annual Serge and Ola Koussevitzky Memorial Concert, including a
performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5, on Aug. 28.
   All proceeds go to the music center's endowment fund, and to a
fund Bernstein established for aspiring young conductors. Ticket
prices start at $20 for a space on the lawn and go up to $5,000 for
front row seats for benefactors.
   Other highlights of the new season include several major debuts,
including that of Soviet painist Vladimir Feltsman, who arrived in
the United States last August after an an eight-year battle to
emigrate; a return visit by the Israel Philharmonic; and a recital
by Irish flutist James Galway.
   This summer is the second in a four-year jubilee of the
festival's 50th anniversary. Events climax in 1990 with observances
marking the 50th year of the music center, the festival's school.

<HEAD>Standards Set for Adjustable-Rate Mortgages</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ARMs can stretch only so far.
   That's the approach being taken to adjustable-rate mortgages
these days at the big, government-created corporations that buy and
insure many of the home loans made in this country by banks,
savings and loans and other financial institutions.
   Over the last few years, the Federal National Mortgage
Association (known as Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. (or Freddie Mac) have been tightening the standards
for adjustable-rate loans they will accept.
   Lately, they both have adopted similar criteria: If a homebuyer
makes a down payment of less than 20 percent of the purchase price,
he or she must qualify financially to make the mortgage payments in
the SECOND year of the loan.
   Why the second year? Because banks, savings institutions and
other lenders typically promote ARMs with enticingly low rates for
the first year.
   After that, the rate _ and the monthly payment, in most cases _
changes according to prevailing trends in interest rates.
   The lender typically specifies a ``cap'' on how much the
interest rate can increase. Generally, caps run at two percentage
points in any one year and five or six points over the life of the
loan.
   Thus, to meet Fannie Mae's or Freddie Mac's standards, a
borrower putting less than 20 percent down and applying for an ARM
with an initial interest rate of 8 percent would have to be able to
pay at a 10 percent interest rate in the loan's second year.
   Whether this is a good idea or a bad one depends on your point
of view. In theory at least, it stands to slam the door on the
housing market for some would-be buyers who do not have the money
to make substantial down payments.
   Just how many is hard to say. Freddie Mac has figured that the
limits will affect about 6 percent of all applicants for ARMs.
   The limits certainly are not being applauded by builders, who
want customers to buy their wares and who are not usually involved
in the mortgage part of the deal.
   At the same time, however, the setting of standards for ARMs can
be seen as a form of discipline on a financial product that is
susceptible to overexuberant promotion, if not downright abuse.
   The bait of a very low first-year interest rate can turn out to
be poisonous for borrowers who do not anticipate how much the cost
of their adjustable loans can increase with the passage of time.
   ``It's not such a bad idea when you think about it,'' says Tara
Little, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association.
   Since ARMs first came into wide usage in the early 1980s, they
have been of great benefit in broadening the supply and
availability of housing credit, said Charlotte Sterling, a
spokeswoman for Fannie Mae. ``But they have to be used prudently.
   ``You don't do anybody any good at all by putting people in a
house they're not going to be able to pay for,'' she asserted.
   Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's standards, it should be noted,
apply only to loans those organizations buy from banks and savings
institutions.
   Dennis Campbell, senior vice president of marketing at Fannie
Mae, said many lenders issue ARMs that they do not intend to
resell. Therefore, he said, homebuyers may well still be able to
find such an institution that is willing to grant a mortgage with
less stringent requirements.
   However, he said, the trend in the mortgage business is toward
more definitive standards for ARMs.
   As Jeannette Bernay, a spokeswoman for Freddie Mac, put it, ``We
want to get people into homes but we also want to keep them there.''

   Actress Cicely Tyson will be looking for food for
the soul, while actor Ossie Davis says the first National Black
Arts Festival promises an opportunity for black artists to shine as
never before.
   Black artists and audiences will feast on events ranging from
the world premiere of Pulitzer Prize-winner Charles Fuller's new
play to a ``Fancy Footwork'' performance by the Copasetics, a group
of the oldest tap dancers alive, during the festival which begins
July 30 and runs through Aug. 7.
   Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to view the 107
performances and exhibits in eight artistic disciplines, but Miss
Tyson said she hoped the festival will have special impact on
blacks in the audiences.
   ``Art for us in the black community is at the bottom of the
ladder,'' she said.
   ``For too long, we've just been trying to support our families,
put bread on the table, roofs over our heads. Art just seems to
have been given a back seat. We are just learning to appreciate art
and to understand it and to know it is just as important as food on
the table. It's food for our souls.''
   The actress said she planned to see some of the paintings and
sculptures on exhibit and take in a performance of ``Sally'' by the
Negro Ensemble Company, the world's oldest professional black
theater company. The play is the latest effort by Fuller, who won a
Pulitzer Prize for ``A Soldier's Play.''
   Miss Tyson, whose work on the upcoming movie ``Dessa Rose'' will
cut short her festival visit, said she also hoped to see ``Apollo,
It Was Just Like Magic,'' a musical about the legendary Harlem
theater also premiering in Atlanta.
   ``Apollo,'' starring Peabo Bryson and Patti Austin, is written,
directed and choreographed by George Faison, who won a Tony Award
for ``The Wiz.''
   ``I want to see a little bit of everything, but I'm going to
have to put on my running shoes to get it all in,'' Miss Tyson said.
   Davis, who will be host for a seven-hour evening of music and
poetry called ``Lyrics to Live By'' on the last day of the
festival, said he also wondered just how much he'll be able to
sample. He'll miss the first few days while acting in Spike Lee's
new movie, ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Davis said he feels a great deal of satisfaction from the
increasing amount of work being offered black artists.
   ``One of the reasons we haven't had a black arts festival of
this scope before is that we've not been able to get national
attention from funding sources or the viewing audiences,'' he said
in an interview. ``It's only in the last 20 or 25 years that
Americans have started to take seriously the contributions of black
artists.
   ``We haven't had the opportunity, but now that we have the
opportunity, we're going to shine.''
   Black artists are getting the chance to strut their stuff in
Atlanta because, five years ago, Michael Lomax, chairman of the
Fulton County Board of Commissioners and a former city of Atlanta
cultural affairs director, decided Atlanta needed a big festival.
   ``My hope was that this would be, for want of a better
comparison, a black Spoleto,'' he said, referring to the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C. ``But our festival is more
urban, less pristine, than Charleton _ but then, so is Atlanta.''
   That Atlanta's festival would showcase black talent is
appropriate for a city with a thriving black arts community, a
black political power structure and a two-thirds black population.
   ``It is a cosmopolitan hub where the black community rubs
shoulders with the best and most powerful of America and the
world,'' said Davis, a native of south Georgia. ``Atlanta is a most
appropriate venue. And, with the Democratic convention just
leaving, it gives the city sort of a one-two punch.''
   The $1.5 million festival will feature ticketed and free events
in the disciplines of music, dance, film, theater, literary arts,
folk art, visual art and performance art. The events at 35
locations around metropolitan Atlanta range from big to small,
mainstream to experimental.
   Musical offerings will include an evening with pianist Leon
Bates and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, two days of the Atlanta
Jazz Festival, a gospel concert and a blues show on Auburn Avenue.
   Dance performances will include work by members of the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Company, Bucket Dance Theatre, the Dunham
Children's Company and dancer-aerialist Joanna Haigood.
   The Georgia Folklife festival at Georgia State Center for Urban
Life will feature performances of blues, jazz, Cajun music,
fiddling and rhythm and blues, and exhibitions of quilting, basket
weaving, netmaking, boatbuilding and other crafts and traditional
skills.
   A series of films will be shown, including a presentation of
four films by 1920s independent black filmmaker Oscar Micheaux and
a docudrama on his life starring Danny Glover.
   Among the exhibitions will be a show at the New Visions Gallery
of Contemporary Art of a selection of 75 works by sculptor and
printmaker Elizabeth Catlett-Mora; her husband, painter Francisco
Mora; and their son, painter and sculptor David Catlett-Mora.
   Also, a juried exhibition open to black artists working in
painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, mixed-media, graphics
and video will be presented at the new gallery of the Collections
of Life and Heritage.

<HEAD>Legendary Science Fiction Author Continues Writing into His 70s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long before there were Trekkies, a space
odyssey or ET, Philip Jose Farmer was entertaining a science
fiction cult with erotic stories of human-alien love affairs and
other fantastic tales.
   His 67 books and short stories are enough to fill a bookcase and
his honors, including three Hugo Awards, would make any writer
proud.
   But Farmer, 70, labors in near obscurity in a quiet,
upper-middle-class neighborhood on Peoria's northwest side. Despite
his success, Farmer hardly is recognizable in the town where he
grew up, attended college and returned to spend most of his adult
life.
   ``I am obscure in Peoria,'' Farmer said recently as he sat
surrounded by thousands of books which line the walls of his
basement office. ``I guess they don't read much around here.''
   But in the literary world of Issac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Robert
Heinlein and Kurt Vonnegut, Farmer is respected and admired.
   Farmer broke new ground in 1952 with his first published story
called ``The Lovers.'' The story, featured on the cover of
Startling Stories, caught the attention of science fiction world
with the first serious treatment of sexuality. The story was based
on a love affair between an Earth man and an alien woman, and
Farmer rocked the science fiction community by dealing with sex in
a frank manner.
   At the time, he was working full time at a Peoria steel mill and
writing on the side. He received 25 rejection slips before selling
``The Lovers.''
   Not only did it launch his career, but it inspired some of the
greatest science fiction writers including Heinlein, whose classic
``Stranger in a Strange Land'' was dedicated to Farmer.
   ``It was tough making a living writing science fiction in those
days because the market wasn't very large,'' Farmer said. ``But it
was like a community. The critics called it a ghetto. Whatever it
was, the writers all knew each other and we knew the fans and we
all got along. It was quite nice.''
   After 11 years at the steel mill, Farmer tried to survive as a
full-time freelance writer but finances forced him back to work as
a technical writer in the defense industry in 1956.
   ``I didn't like it but I had a wife and family to take care
of,'' he said.
   He bounced from New York to Arizona to California in the years
from 1956 to 1969 before finally quitting to concentrate all his
energies on his science fiction writing.
   ``That's when we came back to Peoria,'' Farmer said. ``I hated
the smog in Los Angeles and the traffic.''
   And he's stayed in this river city of 124,000 ever since. But he
doesn't blame the setting for his failure to achieve the fame of
Asimov, Bradbury, Vonnegut or Heinlein. His writing career was
troubled by disagreements with publishers and agents, family
illnesses and other distractions.
   Perhaps his only regret is not pushing harder to break into the
TV writing business during his years in Los Angeles, but Farmer
doesn't think he was cut out to write for television.
   He said ``Star Trek'' producers rejected his ideas as ``too far
out'' for the television audience. And he chafed at a medium in
which one was required to explain the premise of each adventure,
rather than letting viewers figure out the concept on their own.
   But he's a fan of science fiction stories, especially the movies
sparked by the boom in science fiction: ``2001: A Space Odyessy,''
the ``Star Wars'' trilogy, ``ET _ The Extraterrestrial,''
``Alien,'' ``Cocoon'' and ``Back to the Future.''
   And he's capitalizing on the science fiction craze, with another
new book soon to come out, along with the re-release in the fall of
an older novel.
   ``I've got enough ideas to keep going until I'm way past 100,''
Farmer said, adding that while he appreciates the new, mass appeal
of science fiction, he longs for the old days.
   ``I miss the camaraderie from the science fiction ghetto,'' he
said. ``We were a big family.''

<HEAD>Dubai Looking for Economic Boom after Persian Gulf War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: An accompanying story is AM-Dubai-Dhows, b0402.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessmen in this
free-wheeling, free-trading Persian Gulf port say an end to the
Iran-Iraq war is likely to mean an economic boom for the United
Arab Emirates city-state.
   ``It would be just like the Klondike,'' said Stan Robinson, a
Mercedes Benz car dealer.
   Dubai has combined modest oil income with a centuries-old
merchant tradition to make itself the major port in the southern
end of gulf, the most important local trading partner of Iran.
   ``The dream is to be the Hong Kong of the 21st century,'' said
Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayen, chairman of Dubai's massive Jebel Ali
free zone, a $2.5 billion facility that includes what Dubai says is
the world's largest man-made harbor.
   The city-state is already a major transit point for cargo _ much
of it heading across the gulf to Iran. That flow collapsed in the
early years of the war and is just now recovering.
   Although Dubai has weathered the war and a dropoff in oil
revenues, most businessmen believe ``the end of the war will be
positive,'' said Daniel Greenwald, executive vice president of the
American Business Council of Dubai.
   Shipping officials in Dubai, who insisted on anonymity, said
that while Dubai has gained revenues in repairing war-damaged
ships, it has lost business at its container ports and at shipyards.
   ``You can go to a hell of a lot of places for a half a million
dollars,'' said one, referring to the cost of war-risk insurance in
the Persian Gulf for a big container ship.
   Greenwald said the war also has probably deterred some
businessmen from making major investments in Dubai.
   Many traders are also hoping Dubai's historic role as a transit
route for Iranian cargo will carry on as Iran rebuilds after the
war.
   Even during the war, thousands of Iranians a month fly to Dubai
International Airport, the busiest in the Middle East, to shop in
Dubai's famed souks, or markets. The Iran Air jetliner downed by
U.S. Navy missiles in early July was headed for Dubai.
   ``They come in the airport from Bandar Abbas. ... They shop,
they load the dhows (boats) down, they go back again,'' said
Abdulla Abul-Houl, foreign relations director for Dubai's Chamber
of Commerce.
   The waterfront is piled with new washing machines, tires, car
parts and sometimes whole cars destined for Iran aboard the
hand-built little wooden dhows that ply the gulf.
   The Iranians are part of an exotic mixture of visitors and
expatriates from India, Pakistan, the Philippines and the West who
outnumber Dubai's locals by at least 2-1 in the population of
490,000.
   Many of the foreigners are lured by Dubai's tolerance in an area
where Islamic law and customs predominate. Its high-rise hotels
feature British-style pubs, Lebanese nightclubs and Japanese
restaurants.
   Entertainment ranges from a grassy golf course to ice rinks,
complete with an ice hockey league.
   Dubai is also tax-free, and relatively free of the red-tape and
oppressive security that dim the allure of many Middle Eastern
countries.
   ``Its like utopia,'' said Robinson, who is among Dubai's more
enthusiastic backers.
   But the lack of local labor means companies must import workers,
often from Sri Lanka or India, at wages of $140 to $220 monthly for
an unskilled worker.
   Dubai's location midway between Europe and the Far East has made
its airport one of the busiest transit points in the world.
   Its massive dry docks are booked months in advance for ship
refittings, despite the dangers of the gulf.
   Bin Sulayim said Dubai hopes by the end of this year to pass an
offshore-company law and is considering offshore banking, a move
that would place Dubai in competition with the island nation of
Bahrain farther north in the gulf.
   Companies such as Kodak, General Motors, Toyota and Polaroid
have established regional administrative or service centers here,
some responsible for territories stretching from Greece in Europe
to Kenya in Africa to Singapore in Southeast Asia.
   ``You don't have to go down and persuade government officials
why they want another business in town,'' Greenwald said.
   ``Trade is in the blood,'' said Bin Sulayem. He noted that when
the United States banned imports of Iranian pistachio nuts, Dubai
traders bought huge quantities at depressed prices, then processed
and bagged them and exported them to America.

<HEAD>Dubai Still Uses Traditional Dhows to Trade with Iran</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Dubai-Looking Ahead, b0403</HEAD>

   A fleet of little wooden
dhows dart daily past the supertankers and warships of the Persian
Gulf, carrying on a historic link between war-torn Iran and Arab
Dubai.
   ``We bring lots of onions from Iran; watermelons, any kind of
food and fruits that we can,'' said Hossein, a crewman who aboard a
dhow docked at Dubai's busy waterfront.
   Stacked and strewn all along the dock were piles of tires, boxed
washing machines and automobile parts, bicycles and bedsprings _
consumer goods destined for Iran aboard dhows.
   The hand-made dhows have sailed the 150 miles from Dubai to
Bandar Abbas in Iran for generations, but with the Iran-Iraq war
the route has taken on added importance.
   ``Most of the other gulf countries except for Dubai and Kuwait
have cut their trade links with Iran, so ... most of the stuff we
bring here goes to the other gulf countries. It's sort of a
collection point for us,'' said Capt. Avaz Oveisi, who has spent 34
of his 62 years sailing dhows.
   Iranians by the thousands _ those who can find foreign currency
_ fly into Dubai to shop and send the goods back home by dhow.
   If the goods are new, the pattern isn't. Dubai's ports and
merchants once dealt in pearls and silk.
   ``Dubai is a trading place. They were smuggling and trading with
the rest of the world for centuries,'' said Daniel Greenwald,
executive vice president of the American Business Council of Dubai.
Even in the days of container shipping, Greenwald said, ``it can be
very economical to use the little dhows,'' which can tie up in
small ports and unload their cargoes quickly.
   The boats generally take eight to 12 hours to cross the gulf, an
arduous journey where temperatures can climb to 110 degrees or
more, with humidity at 90 percent.
   ``Its really tiring to work on a dhow all the day, in all of the
heat ... and to load and unload,'' said Abbas Abassi, a dhow
crewman.
   Despite the dozens of warships cruising the gulf, none of the
dhow crewmen said they had been threatened, although some said they
were worried after a U.S. ship shot down an Iran Air jetliner.
   ``Since the airplane has been hit, we're very scared but there
hasn't been any real incident,'' Abassi said.
   ``Even if they're scared they have to do it because this is the
way they make money for their families.''

<HEAD>Guitar Great Les Paul Still Plucks The Strings at 73</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Les Paul sat on a stool at a basement jazz club
on the Lower East Side, the fingers of his left hand cascading down
the neck of his guitar in soft, precise steps.
   At 73, the greatness of his guitar still draws laughs, sighs and
applause from audiences at Fat Tuesday's.
   For the past four years he and his three-piece group have been
playing clubs, performing the same mellow standards Paul has done
for decades. Some of them _ ``Via Con Dios,'' ``How High the Moon''
_ were songs made famous during his long partnership with his
ex-wife, the late singer Mary Ford, from whom he was divorced in
1962.
   Younger musical stars such as Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, Dire
Strait's Mark Knopfler and Dutch guitarist Eddie Van Halen come to
pay tribute and sit in with a musician who did it first and who
many believe still does it best.
   ``In my lifetime, the guitar hasn't changed enough to put in
your hat,'' Paul said, picking an imaginary guitar. ``Whether
you're Segovia or Van Halen, you can't do anything unless you can
do it here.''
   Paul, a musician-composer-designer-inventor, is the acknowledged
father of electronic music. In 1937, he became the first major
artist to play electric guitar when the 65 members of Fred Waring's
Pennsylvanians big band voted unanimously to let Paul play his
amplified contraption.
   ``Suddenly it was recognized that power was a very important
part of music,'' he said in an interview. ``To have the dynamics,
to have the way of expressing yourself beyond the normal limits of
an unamplified instrument, was incredible. Today a guy wouldn't
think of singing a song on a stage without a microphone and a sound
system.
   ``But today, there are a lot of parents who blame Les Paul for
all the racket going on in their basement,'' he said with a smile,
a reference to the thousands of teen-agers whose love affair with
the guitar is expressed in decibels.
   For seven years in the 1950s, Paul and Ford broadcast a TV show
from their home in Mahwah, N.J., which the Listerine Co. _ sponsor
of the show _ bought for the couple to get them to move to New
Jersey from California.
   It was with Ford that Paul developed two-track recording, known
today as dubbing, a process that revolutionized recording in the
'40s and is the backbone of studio work today.
   The guitar that bears his name, the Les Paul, is a legend in its
own right made by the Gibson Co. of Nashville. The list of rock and
fusion jazz musicians who choose to play it reads like a who's who
of modern popular music: blues master B.B. King, Pete Townsend of
The Who, Steve Howe of Yes, jazz great Al DiMeola, Led Zeppelin's
Page and Paul McCartney, who with Paul's help designed his own
custom version of the guitar.
   In turn, two generations of aspiring guitarists have saved their
money for Les Pauls. The most popular model today sells for between
$800 and $900.
   It is the Les Pauls' bigger, ``fatter'' sound that attracted
musicians back in the late '50s, when the first of the classically
inspired guitars was produced. The Les Pauls' innovation was the
use of two, double-coiled pick-ups that reduced the twang of other
guitars and gave the musician a broader range of sounds as the
change the tone or volume on each pick-up.
   Paul Jernigan, Gibson's marketing director, said sales figures
for the guitar are kept confidential but the 12 Les Paul models
continue to grow in popularity and the company now has six months
worth of back orders.
   The instrument's main competition for nearly two decades has
been the Fender Stratocaster, a lighter guitar with a dramatic
molded body. The Stratocaster, or Strat, as it is commonly known,
has its own claim on guitar aristocracy: Jimi Hendrix played a
Strat (and burned several on stage); Eric Clapton and Robin Trower
both prefer the Fenders.
   Ironically, Paul said, most kids these days know what a Les Paul
is, but not who he is. He also has mixed feelings about today's
rock 'n' roll and the way his guitar is now being used. He hates
distortion and electronic gimmicks. ``They're just ways of hiding
what the guitarist can't do with these,'' he said, wiggling his
fingers.
   ``The first rock stuff, I mean in the early '60s, it was bad _
bad singers, bad players, bad everything. But they went from three
chords on guitar and by 1988 we now have some fantastic musicians
in all fields. There are some kids who can go into a music store
and pick up a guitar today and play anything; it's shocking.''
   But one thing Paul has not done is stop learning.
   Gibson has agreed to market a ``super-guitar'' he is now
designing, which he said would sell for nearly $35,000. He also is
expecting a visit from McCartney at Fat Tuesday's for a
performance, though a date has not been set.
   ``You can do anything in music as long as you can think it up,''
he said. ``That's a very exciting thing.''

   If a second sequel follows this summer's
martini-soaked movie, ``Arthur 2: On the Rocks,'' it could very
well be ``Arthur 3: On the Wagon.''
   Once a motion picture staple, the lovable screen lush may be
drying up as Hollywood adapts to the changing attitudes and tastes
of the ``Just Say No'' 1980s.
   Since its premiere July 8, ``Arthur 2'' has been greeted by both
caustic reviews and unspectacular box office results. The film's
poor showing may signal a shift in audience tolerance for alcohol.
   ``I really think that the public has had it,'' said Brian Dyak,
president of the Entertainment Industries Council, which monitors
Hollywood's depiction of substance abuse. ``People nowadays aren't
going to buy into the glorification of the alcoholic.''
   What's more, a flurry of filmmakers is now betting that
moviegoers are ready for unblinking looks at the darker side of
drug use, updates of 1945's ``The Lost Weekend.'' Unlike the giddy
marijuana scenes from 1983's ``Terms of Endearment'' and 1985's
``The Breakfast Club,'' these new films will take a decidely
bleaker view of getting high.
   In ``Clean and Sober,'' opening Aug. 10, Michael Keaton plays a
hot-shot real estate broker whose career and personal life are
ruined by cocaine addiction.
   Similar storylines are featured in the upcoming movies
``Wired,'' about John Belushi's death from a drug overdose; ``The
Boost,'' starring James Woods as a high-powered salesman with a
narcotic dependency, and ``Bird,'' director Clint Eastwood's
profile of alto sax superstar Charlie Parker, who died at age 34
after a life of drug abuse.
   Marketing the three films may prove difficult. Nevertheless, it
is increasingly clear that some movies which portray substance
abuse in a positive light have been left wobbling from critical
backlash in these more sober times.
   ``I think, in general, sobriety is considered a more popular
model now,'' said Paul Moore, development director for the Scott
Newman Center, which is named for the late son of actor Paul Newman
and bestows awards for realistic television portrayals of substance
abuse. ``How we looked at things in the '60s and '70s is very
different from how we look at things in the '80s.''
   Even cigarette use on screen, according to the American Cancer
Society, is down.
   Those who don't keep current may suffer. Several reviewers have
pounced on ``License to Drive,'' a comedy that stars Corey Haim and
Corey Feldman as teen-agers out to get their first driving
licenses. The problem with ``License to Drive,'' according to Bob
Mondello, a film critic for National Public Radio, is that one of
its longer scenes uses drunk driving for laughs.
   ``My first reaction was, how can these morons do this?''
Mondello said in an interview. ``What kind of responsible filmmaker
would write a movie like this and target it to kids? We have heard
about (the dangers of drunken driving) over and over, and it's
impossible for us to take it lightly now.''
   ``License to Drive'' has enjoyed only tepid business in theaters
since arriving July 6; even teen-agers, Mondello said, aren't
laughing at the drunk driving.
   Meanwhile, the summer box-office hit ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit''
seems to send out a mixed message on alcohol. Although the movie's
private eye, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), abandons his bottle at
film's end, the title character (a cartoon figure) escapes both
depression and danger by gulping a glass of whiskey.
   Such cavalier images of alcohol use upset George Marcelle,
public information officer for the National Council on Alcoholism.
   ``There is a classic tradition of depicting drunks without
showing the real effects,'' Marcelle said. ``In the original
`Arthur,' he was falling-down drunk and the total negative effect
we were shown were some hangovers.
   ``In real life, Arthur would black out, he'd probably have some
serious physical problems like high blood pressure, liver disease
or body shakes in the morning, and he'd be prone to throwing up and
dry heaves,'' Marcelle said.
   In ``Arthur 2,'' the title character spends all but the final
reel of the movie stumbling around in a drunken daze. Arthur says
at movie's end that he has stopped drinking, but the only clear
consequence of his constant intoxication is a temporary delay in
his adoption of a baby.
   ``When I first saw the preview for `Arthur 2,' I said, `How can
they do it?''' said Barney Rosenzweig, who as executive producer of
televison's ``Cagney & Lacey'' won wide praise for the show's frank
chronicle of Detective Chris Cagney's battle with alcoholism. ``I
think it's in bad taste.''
   So consistent is the criticism of ``Arthur 2'' that Moore has
said his character may go sober should there be an ``Arthur 3.''
   ``It just seems times and public attitude toward alcoholism have
changed since we made `Arthur' in 1981,'' Moore told columnist
Marilyn Beck.
   Liza Minnelli, Moore's co-star in the movie and herself once
hospitalized for chemical dependency, defended ``Arthur 2.''
   ``It's a highly stylized kind of comedy,'' Minnelli said. ``I
don't know any real alcoholics who are as adorable as Arthur. In
fact, some of my friends who have the same disease I do think he's
hysterical because he brings back memories when it was fun to
drink.''
   There are indications some Hollywood figures will continue to
employ drug use for its supposed comic effect.
   Tommy Chong, half of the Cheech (Marin) and Chong comedy team
and star of the 1978 marijuana spoof ``Up in Smoke,'' is now making
``Far Out Man.'' In it, Chong is ``still bonged out,'' according to
the film's spokeswoman, Deborah Brown.
   ``He plays the same kind of character he has always played,''
Brown said. Chong appears in the movie wearing a ``Just Say No''
T-shirt, but the lettering has faded so it reads ``Just Say O.''
   Television film critic Roger Ebert thinks audiences don't really
care about social issues when they set out for the theater. ``I'm
inclined to believe that people go to a movie if they think they'll
have a good time,'' Ebert said. ``Public attitudes on the subject
matter are usually not germane to the box office. I just saw (the
upcoming movie) `Cocktail.' And Tom Cruise drinks in 85 percent of
the film's scenes. And it'll be a huge hit.''
   ``The movies have come a long way, but they still have a long
way to go,'' said producer Herman Rush, a contributor to the White
House Conference on a Drug-Free America report, given to Congress
and the president in June.
   Among the report's recommendations was one advising filmmakers
to avoid ``any positive portrayal of illicit drug use'' and another
urging the Motion Picture Association of America to employ the
movie rating system to ``more effectively identify inappropriate
depictions of illegal drug use.'' The MPAA has repeatedly rejected
an overhaul of its rating system.
   In the end, the judge of what's acceptable and what's not will
likely be ticket sales.
   ``If there is a reflection of the public's change in
attitudes,'' said Rush, ``it will be `Arthur 2's'' failure at the
box office.''

   Amid the fir trees and hills of the
Klickitat Valley, Larry and Meg Letterman are putting in a hot tub
while waiting for disaster.
   The Lettermans are creators of Ponderosa Village, a 1,000-acre
``intentional community'' whose residents hope to ensure their
survival in the social upheavals they see on the horizon.
   They say they are not survivalists, not a religious cult and not
a commune.
   They are just people who are equipping their elaborate homes
with bomb shelters and large stocks of food. They value their
distance from large urban areas, where they sense disaster looming.
   ``There is a greater chance of mishap and social disorder in the
cities,'' said the 67-year-old Letterman.
   ``Our emphasis is on being prepared for whatever might come down
the pike,'' said his wife, who's 68.
   Something as simple as a truckers' strike could bring chaos,
they contend.
   ``The supply of food in larger cities is down from 2 days to
1-1{ days,'' Letterman said. ``Just a ripple in the trucking system
could cause riots in large cities.''
   Cities also breed disease, stress, pollution and political
upheaval, and would be targets in nuclear warfare, say the
Lettermans.
   To prepare, they are developing a community where members would
have their own stored food, seeds, water source, medical supplies,
tools and ``means of self-defense.''
   ``I don't want to give the impression we're wearing robes and
waiting for doomsday to come,'' Letterman said. ``It's not like
that.''
   But part of the allure is that the southcentral Washington
development is 70 miles from Yakima, Wash., 120 miles from
Portland, Ore., and 210 miles from Seattle, according to a brochure.
   In a time of upheaval, people will stream out of those cities,
heading into the country for safety, they said.
   ``Access to Ponderosa Village is restricted by mountains,
rivers, forest lands, number of approach roads and entrances,'' the
brochure says, ``making protection feasible.''
   Ponderosa Village, built on a heavily forested hillside, has the
aura of a summer camp, with its wood-sided homes, red-dirt forest
trails and whistling winds.
   No weapons were evident when an AP reporter visited. Letterman
said residents had agreed not to discuss weapons or food and
equipment stockpiles, leaving those to the discretion of individual
families.
   About 50 five-acre parcels have been sold, to people from places
like Long Island, N.Y., Seattle, Texas, California and even
Switzerland, Letterman said. Undeveloped parcels cost $9,000 to
$15,000.
   So far 13 families, a total of 32 people, have taken up
residence in this development about five miles from Goldendale,
population about 3,500.
   The Lettermans say it is coincidence that they chose to locate
just 100 miles north of Rajneeshpuram, the now-disbanded commune
where Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh moved his sect in 1981.
   Unlike Rajneesh, the Lettermans have drawn little attention.
   ``There are a lot of good people who live up there,'' said
Sheriff Jim Gleason, who declined to say whether his office had
received any complaints about the development.
   Steven Anderson, former county planner, said the only complaints
came from inside the development and involved internal regulations.
   ``People were complaining that when they bought the lot they
didn't understand the fine print,'' said Anderson, now a private
consultant.
   One of the complainers was Tim Urchenko, a former industrial
engineer from Dallas, who was upset by rules restricting the
cutting of trees.
   ``I like the property and the people have been good except for
the problem with all the rules,'' said Urchenko, who now makes
intricate boxes and sells them at craft shows.
   ``When you come from the city, you are living with all kinds of
people around you and you're used to rules,'' Urchenko said. ``But
then you move out here ... and you think, `Why do we need this?'''
   The Lettermans moved to the development from Los Altos, Calif.,
in 1982, five years after acquiring the land for a sum they will
not disclose.
   Since that time they have marked off 200 parcels, put in roads
and a water system, bought a fire truck and built their own
spectacular house.
   The 3,000-square foot residence includes a new hot tub, attached
greenhouse, satellite dish and a root cellar where they store
everything from dried beans to champagne. The earth-covered root
cellar doubles as a bomb shelter.
   The land is nearly paid off and all improvements have been paid
for in cash, so the remaining debt is small, the Lettermans said.
   They recruit like-minded people through ads in magazines like
Mother Earth News and Mother Jones. They also advertise in New Age
religious publications. They have been New Age followers, as are 75
percent of the development's residents, according to Meg Letterman.
   ``People ask if this is a religious cult,'' she said. ``No, but
preparedness is its own religion.''
   There is a community meditation chapel as well as a stone
gathering circle, where residents occasionally get together to
share beliefs, she said.
   Prospective buyers are told they will be required to conform to
the principles of self-reliance and to contribute to building
community spirit. The Lettermans say they do not want people
dependent on ``handouts.''
   Instead, they want people who can find work in area industries
or who can create their own jobs. Current residents work in the
nearby aluminum mill, or as nurses, printers, computer analysts and
in arts and crafts.
   Meg Letterman was editor of National Reporter, a magazine
published by the Zero Population Growth organization, while Larry
was an Air Force officer working with military satellites.
   They wanted to escape cities, but at the same time they were not
interested in small towns, which can be an ``ingrown tribal
society'' where they would not be accepted, Letterman said.
   ``We thought it was better to start some sort of a community
with people with similar interests,'' he said.
   Ponderosa Village is not a back-to-the-earth commune.
   While many people have their own vegetable gardens and orchards,
large-scale farming is not possible. The emphasis is on stocking
canned and dried foods.
   The houses are modernistic and elaborate, some featuring
geodesic dome designs and natural heating and cooling systems.
   The Lettermans provide a lending library with over 2,000 titles,
many of them do-it-yourself books.
   The community is not utopian or communal, but is held together
by its families, Letterman said.
   ``Utopian is a fantasy or a dream,'' he said. ``You can come
here and increase your awareness of life.''

<HEAD>LIFE ABROAD: New Delhi's Monsoon _ A Time for Rejoicing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the dusty days of summer, when
temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end, New Delhi
rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains.
   ``In the West, the rains are depressing. In India they are a
time of great joy, release, beauty and romance,'' says Khushwant
Singh, a noted author and journalist.
   As the rains come, the dust settles. Parched gardens suddenly
turn green. Temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers.
   But the monsoon has its sad side.
   The rains that started early in July ended two years of drought
in northern India, promising good crops at last, but they also
unleashed floods that left scores of people dead.
   For New Delhi, the downpour broke the stifling heat, but
telephones went dead, potholes multiplied or grew deeper, and
disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and
wells.
   At the first delicious moment of the monsoon, though, the
nourishing rain kept such troubles distant.
   ``The monsoon ... for most Indians ... is not only the source of
life, but also their most exciting contact with nature,'' says
author-journalist Singh.
   When the clouds first burst open over New Delhi, dozens of
half-naked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed
in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the Yamuna River.
   ``It's always like this,'' said Gulab, an elderly woman watching
the fun. ``The children love to play in the rain, but they
invariably get sick.''
   More than 5,300 people have been treated this year for
gastro-enteritis and cholera in New Delhi. At least 75 have died,
most of them children.
   Maya Rao, a university teacher who has lived in New Delhi for
many years, described New Delhi's monsoon this way:
   ``There is muck and mud all over, mosquitoes attack you in
hordes, diseases spread like vice. It's impossible to get to places
on time, given the state of the roads, and calling people on the
phone is such a nuisance _ half the phones are dead.''
   Then, she added, there's the humidity.
   ``The moment the rain stops, you sweat to death.''
   Even so, Ms. Rao went on, she can't imagine life without the
monsoon.
   ``What could be more delightful than eating `bhutta' (roasted
corn-on-the-cob) on your terrace as the grey-purple skies melt into
rain?''
   One city official, who insisted on anonymity, said he could do
no work during the monsoon.
   ``It's too beautiful just to relax, sit and watch the rain,'' he
said, as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window.

the Iran-Iraq war would soon reduce the world oversupply of oil.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, fell 47 cents to settle at $15.23 a barrel Tuesday

   Coal industry officials predict that the
nation's coal companies will have record production this year, as
some utilities turn to coal-fired generators to replace
hydroelectric power in this summer of drought and searing heat.
   In a midyear production forecast, the National Coal Association
said Tuesday that production of bituminous, anthracite and lignite
coal should total 926 million tons in 1988, up 9 million tons from
last year's record.
   The Washington-based group also said consumption of domestic and
imported coal is expected to total 932 million tons, an increase of
15 million tons from last year's record.

   Housing construction rebounded partially in
June from the sharp slump in May, and economists say rising
mortgage rates likely will curtail home building for the rest of
the year.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that builders started
construction of new houses and apartments at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.45 million units in June, up 5.1 percent from the
previous month.
   But the improvement only partly offset a precipitous 12.6
percent decline in May.

   An estimated 240,000 people left the land last
year, reducing the nation's farm population to the lowest level
since before the Civil War, the government has reported.
   According to the results of an annual Census Bureau survey

   Many economists expect rising mortgage rates to crimp home
building for the rest of the year, despite a government report that
housing construction partially rebounded in June from a sharp slump
in May.
   Speculation that interest rates would rise further also hit Wall
Street, overriding Tuesday's flurry of favorable corporate earnings
reports. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 11
points Monday, dropped another 20.63 to close at 2,097.26.
   But in the bond market, interest rates declined in speculation
that inflation would not heat up, following drops in oil and
commodity futures prices. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond
fell to 9.20 percent from 9.23 percent late Monday.
   Oil futures prices retreated as traders grew skeptical that a
possible cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war would soon reduce the
world oversupply of oil, while corn and soybean futures plunged
again as rain continued in the parched Midwest.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August-delivery
contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
fell 47 cents to settle at $15.23 per barrel.
   In its housing report, the Commerce Department said builders
started construction of new houses and apartments at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.45 million units in June, up 5.1 percent
from the previous month.
   But the improvement only partly offset a 12.6 percent decline in
May.
   ``The June numbers are just a technical correction. They don't
really signal a rebound in housing,'' said Thomas M. Holloway,
senior economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
   The hot, dry weather of June, bad for farming but ideal for home
building, also contributed to the uptick.
   And mortgage interest rates, which had climbed by three-quarters
of a percentage point from post-stock crash lows in early March,
eased slightly in June, falling by nearly a quarter of a percentage
point.
   But interest rates began edging up again in July and most
analysts expect the slump in housing, one of the weakest sectors of
a growing overall economy, to continue through 1988.
   In other economic news on Tuesday:
   _Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng began a 10-state inspection
of drought damage. The Agriculture Department, in a drought-related
measure, said growers of hybrid corn for seed will have the option
of planting their crop and not have it counted as a feed grain
under 1988 acreage programs.
   _The government reported that an estimated 240,000 people left
the land last year, dropping the nation's farm population to the
lowest level since before the Civil War.

   Oil futures prices have retreated, amid
skepticism that a possible cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war would
soon reduce the world oversupply of crude.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude oil, fell the most sharply Tuesday, settling 47 cents
lower at $15.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Traders said the contract for August delivery, which expires
Wednesday, was depressed partly by plentiful inventories of oil at
U.S. terminals. The September contract, which is less sensitive to
short-term inventories, fell 26 cents at $15.63 a barrel.
   ``The market took a more realistic view today,'' said Andrew
Lebow, an analyst at E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc. in New
York. ``Based on real fundamentals, there still is a short-term or
maybe even intermediate-term oversupply of crude.''
   On Monday, the August contract for West Texas Intermediate had
jumped 84 cents a barrel after Iran said it would accept a United
Nations resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in its
nearly 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   The news raised the possibility that members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be able to set aside their
differences and agree to production cutbacks that would prop up
prices.
   But Lebow said, ``There's a lot of work to be done to get from
the end of the war to OPEC production cutbacks.''
   ``I think that yesterday's rally was totally overdone,'' said
William Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Also depressing oil prices Tuesday were reports that Iraqi
warplanes raided an unfinished nuclear plant and other Iranian
industrial targets. War communiques from Tehran said Iranian
warplanes retaliated by raiding a dam in Iraq.
   Another factor hurting prices was an unconfirmed report that
Saudi Arabia was selling oil from Caribbean inventories to
non-contractual customers at prices near the spot price, Lebow said.
   The contract for August delivery of No.2 heating oil, up 2.15
cents on Monday, fell .37 cent to 42.90 cents a gallon on the New
York Merc. The contract for August delivery of unleaded gasoline,
up 1.38 cents on Monday, fell .46 cent to 50.65 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. has thrown down a new
challenge to International Business Machines Corp. with a claim
that its computers can process transactions for one-third the cost
of IBM's.
   Digital made the claim Tuesday in announcing a major thrust in
the field of transaction processing, a burgeoning computer industry
segment in which IBM so far has dominated Digital.
   Digital President Kenneth Olsen called transaction processing
``the fastest-growing part of the business computer market'' and
vowed to grab a bigger part of it. Analysts said the goal was
realistic.
   IBM, meanwhile, brought out three more powerful models of its RT
workstation and an improved version of DOS, the operating system
used on its original line of personal computers.
   Transaction processing is the kind of computing done by bank
tellers, airline reservation clerks and other people who need to
interact closely with computers. It is gradually shoving aside
batch processing, in which a computer churns through reams of work
without interference.
   Digital said tests of its new systems showed they could process
transactions for less than one-third the cost of IBM and half the
cost of Tandem Computers Inc.
   IBM said it had not seen Digital's claim and could thus not
immediately respond.
   David Dempsey, manager of corporate product marketing for
Tandem, said, ``I'm not worried. It was an apples for oranges
comparison.''
   The worldwide market for transaction processing, $20 billion to
$30 billion a year, probably will double in five years, a Digital
executive told Datamation magazine earlier this year.
   IBM is the clear market leader in transaction processing,
accounting last year for 48.5 percent of the systems installed at
almost 7,000 minicomputer sites across the country, vs. 6.6 percent
for Digital, according to a survey last summer by Datamation and
Cowen & Co.
   Other rivals for Digital are Unisys Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Tandem and Wang Laboratories Inc.
   But the products announced Tuesday could help even the score for
Digital. Digital unveiled a range of services and products,
including software, monitors and data-storage devices, that make
its existing line of computers better at transaction processing.
   ``Digital has been in transaction processing for a long time,
and is among the largest suppliers to the market,'' Olsen said in a
written statement. ``But our customers are asking us to do more.''
   Craig Symons, an analyst for Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.,
said Digital's offerings are unusually strong because they are
effectively knitted into the company's existing product line.
   Symons said Digital seemed to be accurate in its claims about
its cost advantage against IBM. But he said IBM's disadvantage
would lessen somewhat through the use of a new version of its DB2
data-base management software.
   IBM said all three new models of its RT workstation use a
processor that provides up to 25 percent better performance than
the processor used in their predecessor. The computers are intended
mainly for science and engineering, although IBM says they can also
be used for general business.
   In the personal computer area, IBM had promised last year to
keep improving DOS even after it introduced its Operating System-2,
but this was the first evidence of it. Also Tuesday, IBM announced
a July 29 availability date for the extended edition of its
Operating System-2, which bundles together various communications
and data management features.
   IBM and Microsoft Corp. simultaneously introduced the new
version of DOS, which has easy-to-use screen features such as menus
and graphics. The version, named DOS 4.0, can also handle larger
data files and more main memory. The price is $150, or $95 for
people upgrading from an older version of DOS.

<HEAD>Financial Managers Expect Little Change In Economy Through Year
End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate financial managers surveyed by a trade group generally
expect the economy to remain stable through the year's end, with
moderate inflation and rising interest rates, but a substantial
number expect things to get worse.
   Some 41 percent of the corporate controllers responding to the
survey by the National Association of Accountants said they
expected the economy to remain the same during the next 12 months,
while 37 percent predicted it would get worse, the association
reported today.
   Some 22 percent said they believed the economy would improve.
   The association said 28 percent of its 3,200 corporate
controller members responded to the survey, which was conducted
during the fourth week of June.
   Most respondents, 59 percent, expected inflation during the
second half of the year to rise to the 5 percent to 6 percent
range, while 62 percent said they foresaw higher interest rates.
Consumer prices, one measure of inflation, were up by 4.4 percent
through May of this year, the Labor Department has reported.
   Some 8 percent of the respondents said they expected a minor
recession this year with most anticipating at least a slight
downturn in the economy by 1990.
   The accountants group, based in Montvale, N.J., asked survey
participants to rank the top three factors they believed would have
the greatest impact on the economy during the next six months.
   Interest rates were chosen by 62 percent, followed by the budget
deficit, 49 percent. Some 38 percent said inflation would have a
big impact and 37 percent pointed to the November general election.
   Survey participants overwhelmingly expected strong growth for
their companies in the next six months compared with 1987, with
some 73 percent expecting higher sales and 64 percent predicting
higher profits.
   Capital expenditures were expected to remain the same during the
second half of the year, according to 48 percent of the respondents.
   The controllers also said they expected their companies'
employment picture to remain stable. Some 54 percent said they
forsaw no change in their company's employment level, while 13
percent said they expected declines.
   Among other responses:
   _58 percent said there should be increased federal regulations
for mergers and acquisitions.
   _56 percent said they expected a recession in 1990, with 20
percent predicting a major downturn and 80 percent saying it would
be minor.
   _31 percent expect continued fluctuations in the dollar.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Gold and Silver Jump</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against major currencies in early
European trading today amid fears dollar selling by central banks
would continue.
   Gold prices jumped $9 an ounce in Zurich and $8 in London and
silver prices also surged.
   Dealers said fears that European central banks again would
intervene to sell dollars and the belief that the dollar's recent
rise was overextended dampened bullish dollar sentiment in the
market.
   ``The U.S. trade imbalance is certainly improving, but everyone
knows a rapid rise in the dollar will only break that process,''
said a dealer in Milan, Italy.
   He predicted the dollar would continue to trade within a narrow
range.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.80 Japanese yen to a closing 133.05
yen. Later, in London, it edged up to 133.22 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7110 from $1.6937 late
Tuesday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's
quotes, included: 1.8475 West German marks, down from 1.8640;
1.5320 Swiss francs, down from 1.5475; 6.2325 French francs, down
from 6.2845; 2.0825 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1010; 1,368.50
Italian lire, down from 1,383.60; and 1.1960 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2011.
   The sudden leap in precious metals prices apparently was sparked
by a combination of a lower dollar and a miner's strike in Peru,
they said.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $444.25 a troy ounce, up
from $437 bid late Tuesday. At mid-morning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $445.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $445.50, up from $436.50 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $7.86 to close at a bid of
$446.84 a troy ounce.
   Silver bullion jumped in London to a bid price of $7.64 a troy
ounce, up from $7.13 bid late Tuesday.

   Stock prices rebounded sharply today with the main
market index making its largest one-day gain of the year, while the
dollar slipped for the second consecutive day against the Japanese
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which took its
biggest plunge of the year, 513.09 points, on Tuesday, regained
404.95 points, or 1.49 percent, to close Wednesday at 27,553.98.
   It was the largest single-day gain for the Nikkei, the most
widely followed barometer of the exchange, since Nov. 13, 1987,
when the index jumped 901.75 points.
   After opening at 27,330.72 points, the Nikkei index declined
further in the morning because of additional selling by investors
who held onto their shares yesterday during the sudden plunge,
brokers said.
   But the market rebounded in the late morning with brokers buying
electronics and high-tech shares instead of their old favorites,
steel and shipbuilding. The ``export-oriented'' shares led the
market in the afternoon as it ragained most of what it lost Tuesday.
   ``Today's market trends indicate goodbye to steels and
shipbuildings and hello to electronics and high-techs,'' said
Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko Securities. ``With the yen's slight
depreciation, investors found export-oriented electronics shares
worth betting on. It seems as though most of those who sold steel
shares yesterday bought electronics today.''
   Electronics shares soared in today's trading with Hitachi,
Toshiba and Mitsubishi Electric shares reaching new highs. Sony
Corp. Matsushita Electric and NEC shares also gained significantly.
   ``A new direction seems to have emerged in the market,''
Watenabe said.
   Volume traded in the first section of the exchange was estimated
at 1.3 billion shares, of which 800 million were traded during the
afternoon session.
   The dollar closed at 133.05 yen, down 0.80 yen from Tuesday,
when the currency lost 1.30 yen. After opening at 133.05 yen, it
moved in a range of 132.90-133.35 yen in a slow trading.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar was on the way up in early
morning trading after a 1.36 yen drop in New York overnight. But
profit-taking prevented the currency from rising.
   ``Many players were holding up on selling dollars until it moved
up to upper 133's,'' said a dealer at a U.S. investment bank in
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But it never got that
high.''

<HEAD>Inventor Thinks Wheel Extenders May Curb Safety Problem in Samurai</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HILLIARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inventor Russell Emanis believes he has a solution
to the Suzuki Samurai's reported instability problem that caused
sales to plummet and forced the company to cut its price to dealers
by $2,000 to revive sales.
   Emanis, 26, a Samurai owner, said that for $195, he can expand
the Samurai wheelbase to make the vehicle safer.
   He is manufacturing a 5-stud steel ``doughnut'' that bolts to
the hub. The vehicle's regular tire and wheel then bolts to the
doughnut.
   Emanis claims his device improves the Samurai's stability and
all but eliminates what he says is the vehicle's characteristic
``skitter'' on moderate-speed turns.
   ``We're not trying to tell Suzuki what to do or how to run its
business, but we can't see anyone there is doing anything to
help,'' Emanis said.
   ``What we've done is make the vehicle handle better and feel
more solid. It makes steering tighter. It adds unsprung weight
below the center of gravity.''
   National sales of the four-wheel-drive Samurai dropped 70.6
percent in June from a year earlier after Consumer Reports magazine
claimed the vehicle was prone to roll over if a driver swerved back
and forth to avoid an accident.
   Suzuki officials say their vehicle is at least as stable as any
other four-wheel-drive rig in similar situations.
   Jennifer Astle of Rogers & Associates, Suzuki's public relations
firm, said she was unaware of any plans by Suzuki to improve
stability or of any accessory on the horizon that would do so.
   Last week, Brea, Calif.-based American Suzuki Motor Corp. told
dealers it would cut $2,000 off the price they pay for Samurais
sold through Sept. 2, and allowed dealers to decide how to use the
money.
   Most are passing the cuts on to consumers through price
reduction, rebate or using it as a down payment. The Samurai has a
suggested base retail price of $8,235.
   Emanis, who plans to have his invention tested when new vehicle
``outriggers'' are made, said the package of four disks weighs a
total of 62 pounds and extends the car's track 3 inches to 54.6
inches.
   The Dodge Raider has a factory wheel track of 54.1 inches. The
Ford Ranger truck's is 54.6 inches, and the Isuzu Trooper's is 54.7
inches, he said.
   Emanis, of Morrison, Colo., said he and his partner, Gretchen
Born, developed the product when his primary Suzuki accessory, a
hard top, came onto the market the day the bad publicity started
for the Samurai. He has also developed a roll bar for the Samurai.
   ``We're not trying to make a fortune,'' he said, ``but we are
trying to help the market, obviously, so our mainline business can
get back to work.''

<HEAD>Dow Doubles Second-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Chemical Co.'s second-quarter earnings
doubled because of strong demand and increasing prices for
chemicals and plastics combined with little change in raw material
costs, the company said Wednesday.
   Dow reported record net income of $624 million, or $3.29 a
share, up from $312 million, or $1.62 a share, in the second
quarter of 1987. Revenue rose 25 percent to $4.25 billion from a
restated $3.41 billion a year earlier.
   Net income for the first six months of the year was $1.13
billion, or $5.96 a share, on sales of $8.23 billion, up from $558
million, or $2.90 a share, on sales of $6.42 billion in the first
half of 1987.
   ``Continued strong demand for our products resulted in tight
supply-demand balances, high operating rates and positive price
movement,'' said Enrique Falla, financial vice president.
   ``Feedstock costs were relatively flat, and the combination of
these factors allowed margins to expand,'' Falla said.
   Dow reported across-the-board sales growth, in its basic
chemicals and plastics, consumer specialties such as
pharmaceuticals and agricultural products, and industrial
specialties such as Styrofoam insulation, spokeswoman Sarah
Opperman said.
   ``Based on industry and global economic expectations, we
anticipate a record 1988 and sustained growth into 1989 and
beyond,'' Falla said.

   The stock market moved higher today as traders
gave a sigh of relief that the Japanese market recovered from its
worst decline this year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 7.11 at 2,104.37
in the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 11 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
555 up, 359 down and 484 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.93 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said there was a sense of relief that Tokyo's key
Nikkei index of 225 selected issues closed about 400 points higher,
nearly erasing Tuesday's 500-point drop, its largest decline this
year.
   ``Japan has been on a lot of people's minds,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
Many traders have been anticipating a crack in the Japanese market,
which has had the most impressive recovery from the October market
crash.
   Wachtel said the stock market is continuing to ``meander
around.'' The Dow fell about 20 points on Tuesday amid a confusing
backdrop of robust second-quarter earnings reports, lower oil
prices and a firm bond market.
   But Wachtel noted that equities do not always perform in accord
with what is happening in other markets.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up | at 124|;
AT&T was up [ at 26|; GAF Corp. was up } at 45\, and Tandem was

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.35 to 152.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.22 at 308.61.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.63 to
2,097.26.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about than 9 to 5 on
the NYSE, with 517 up, 918 down and 492 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 144.11 million shares, against 156.21 million in the

   Weyerhaeuser Co. said Wednesday that its
second-quarter profit jumped 69 percent over a year ago because of
strong demand for pulp and paper products.
   Net income for the period ended June 28 was $150.6 million, or
71 cents a share, compared with earnings of $89.2 million, or 42
cents a share, in 1987. Sales rose to $2.1 billion from $1.8
billion.
   For the first half of 1988, the company's profit totaled $264.8
million, or $1.25 a share, on sales of $3.9 billion. That compared
with earnings of $191.1 million, or 92 cents a share, and sales of
$3.38 billion.
   Company president George Weyerhaeuser said markets for pulp and
paper products are continuing to strengthen.
   Weyerhaeuser's financial services subsidiaries and real estate
companies also reported significant improvement in overall
performance during the second quarter.
   Weyerhaeuser's Pacific Northwest woods and wood product mill
contracts have expired, but workers have remained on the job as
negotiators await a federal mediator to call them back to the
bargaining table.

   Stock prices bounced higher Wednesday, boosted by
the stronger British pound.
   Sterling's rise relieved pressure for an increase in interest
rates, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 selected stocks
was up 10.5 points, or 0.6 percent, at 1,855.3 at midday. Volume
was a slim 192.5 million shares, compared with 271.1 million shares
at the same time Tuesday.
   The market shrugged off a report that showed Britain's broad
measure of money supply, M-4, rose an estimated 1.9 percent in
June, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in May. Increases in money
supply are viewed as inflationary.
   The report was ``disappointing but ignored,'' said one equity
salesman, explaining that the figures seemed to contain a lot of
``caveats and special circumstances.''
   Another dealer said the market had prepared itself for ``really
horrendous'' money supply figures.
   When the slightly worse-than-expected numbers were revealed, in
combination with a stronger pound, the market was relieved that the
likelihood of an immediate interest rate hike was averted, he said.

   The drought and heat causing financial
hardship for farmers are a boon to the nation's coal industry,
which expects the abnormal weather to help make 1988 a record year.
   ``It's unfortunate that something that can have such a severe
impact on one part of the economy can help another, but that's
what's happening here,'' said John Grasser of the National Coal
Association.
   ``We're very sympathetic toward farmers,'' he said. ``But with
conditions being what they are, we happen to benefit.''
   The trade association's economic committee released a revised
estimate Tuesday setting coal production at 926 million tons this
year, 9 million tons more than a record set last year.
   In its mid-year forecast, the committee also said domestic
consumption of 932 million tons, including imported coal, would
exceed last year's record by 15 million tons.
   The association initially estimated sales and production at or
below 1987 levels. However, committee member David MacKenzie,
director of strategic planning for the Indianapolis-based AMAX Coal
Co., said the mid-year revisions reflect unexpected demands caused
by weather.
   ``With low-water conditions in the Pacific Northwest,
particularly, utilities that normally use hydroelectric power have
had to turn to coal-fired generators,'' he said. ``There's also
been increased use of air conditioning, and that pushes up the
demand for coal.''
   John Tellmann, vice president of marketing for Mapco Coal Inc.
of Tulsa, Okla., said the committee expects abnormal weather
conditions to boost utilities' coal usage by 7 million to 10
million tons.
   ``Most of the demand increase is going to be for western coal,
because they supply the utilities out there that can't use hydro,''
Tellmann said.
   ``East of the Mississippi (River), we don't expect a significant
increase,'' he said.
   In its forecast, the association projected a 2.9 percent
increase in the gross national product this year and said a
healthier-than-expected economy also played a role in changing its
expectations.
   The group said coal consumption by electric utilities should
total 733 million tons, up 15 million tons from 1987, and that
there is ``a better than 50 percent chance that consumption at
utilities could be even greater.''
   It projected consumption of 38 million tons of metallurgical
coal _ that used in steel production _ for an increase of 1 million
tons from last year, and said industrial consumption should remain
steady at 82 million tons.

   Stock prices moved higher today in quiet trading
as the market rebounded from a sharp decline in the previous

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.45 at 2,101.71

   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with

   Volume on the Big Board came to 41.88 million shares as of 11

Many traders have been anticipating a crack in the Japanese market,
which has had the most impressive recovery from the October market
crash.
   In addition, a stable dollar and a steady bond market helped to
``restore short-term confidence,'' said Michael Metz, a vice
president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   Metz called the Dow's 20-point drop on Tuesday ``overdone'' and
noted it was exacerbated by computer-driven sell programs. The drop
came amid a confusing backdrop of robust second-quarter earnings
reports, lower oil prices and a firm bond market.
   Traders have been hesitant to respond to the favorable earnings
reports because of the specter of higher interest rates down the
road. Metz noted that higher interest rates would diminish the real
value of those earnings gains.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was up [ at 124[;
AT&T was unchanged at 26{; McGraw Hill was up 1~ at 62}.
   Polaroid was up 2 at 36. Shamrock Holdings offered to acquire

   Most soybean futures opened sharply lower today
on the Chicago Board of Trade as scattered showers brought relief
to the drought-stricken Farm Belt for the fifth day in a row. Grain
prices were narrowly mixed.
   The opening drop in soybean prices followed two days of steep
declines and reflected a growing feeling among traders that the
drought has been broken, analysts said.
   ``There's a possibility we won't see a return to hot and dry
conditions any time soon,'' said Walter Spilka, grain analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``It's a mixed call right now, but there's a possiblity we might
see more showers later on in the weekend and that's got a lot of
people thinking the markets have topped and will head lower,''
Spilka said.
   The rain came too late to revive the corn crop in most states
but it's just what the soybeans needed as that crop enters a
critical growth stage, he said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents lower to { cent higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.75{ a bushel; corn was {
cent lower to 2 cents higher with July at $3.08 a bushel; oats were
2 cents to 4 cents lower with September at $2.90{ a bushel;
soybeans were 29{ cents lower to 5{ cents higher with July at $8.68
a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .37 cent lower to .05 cent higher with August
at 63.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .45 cent
lower with August at 75.65 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with July at 46.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .07 cent lower to .53 cent higher with July at 36.20
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Three More Big Banks Report Second-Quarter Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bankers Trust New York Corp., First Interstate Bancorp and Bank
of Boston Corp. _ three of the nation's largest banking companies _
said Wednesday they earned profits in the second quarter after
reporting sharp losses a year ago due to the Third World debt
crisis.
   Bankers Trust, the eighth largest bank holding company in terms
of assets, said net income for the quarter totaled $174.1 million,
or $2.18 a share, compared with a $554 million loss in 1987.
   For the first half of 1988, the company earned $300.1 million,
or $3.79 a share, vs. a loss of $429.7 million a year earlier.
   First Interstate, ranked No. 9, earned $97.23 million, or $2.09
a share, in the second quarter, compared with a $510.26 million
loss last year.
   Earnings for the six-month period totaled $199.8 million, or
$4.29 a share, vs. a $429.72 million loss a year ago.
   Twelfth-ranked Bank of Boston had a second-quarter profit of
$76.1 milion, or $1.10 a share, compared with an $83.7 million
loss. For the first half it netted $160.4 million, compared with a
$13 million loss in the first half of 1987.
   All three banks were among several banking companies to suffer
huge losses or profit declines last year after making hefty
additions to their loan-loss reserves for potentially uncollectible
loans to developing nations.
   The additions followed Brazil's decision to suspend interest
payments on most of its foreign bank debt, and the rise of
concessionary debt repayment plans negotiated by several Third
World countries.
   Brazil has since repaid some of the interest owed, and this year
most major banks have substantially curtailed their loan-loss
provisions.
   Bankers Trust's provision for credit losses during the second
quarter of 1987 had totaled $700 million. The latest provision for
credit losses amounted to $5 million.
   Los Angeles-based First Interstate said that in the second
quarter $84.7 million was provided for possible loan losses, vs.
$795.3 million in 1987.
   Bank of Boston's provision for credit losses was $36 million for
the quarter compared with $325 million last year.

   Stock prices rose today in a sluggish summer
session dominated by program trading and activity in a handful of
takeover issues.
   Some bargain hunters were lured to the market after two days of
declining stock prices, but analysts noted that institutional
buying did not make much of a mark on the day.
   In addition to computer-triggered buy programs, a handful of
issues that are the subject of takeover bids or rumored to be
takeover targets accounted for a substantial amount of trading
volume. Trading strategies designed to capture dividends also added
to the day's volume, analysts said.
   ``There's not the intense institutional trading we've become
accustomed to,'' said Philip Puccio, a senior vice president at
Dillon, Read & Co. ``There's a lot of cash on the sidelines, and
institutions are not in any rush to plunge into the market.''
   Traders again were hit with a flurry of mostly favorable
second-quarter earnings reports but were hesitant to respond for
fear the gains will be canceled out by higher interest rates down
the road.
   Analysts also said there was a sense of relief after Tokyo's key
Nikkei index of 225 selected issues finished about 400 points
higher today, nearly erasing Tuesday's 500-point drop, its largest
decline this year.
   Many traders have been braced for a crack in the Japanese
market, which has recovered impressively from the October market
crash.

<HEAD>Government to Privatize Water Industry in Single Offering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government said Wednesday it intends
to privatize the country's water industry in a stock offering
expected to raise the equivalent of $8.6 billion.
   Shares in Britain's 10 regional water authorities will be
offered to the public in a single 5 billion pound sale at the end
of 1989, said Nicholas Ridley, the government's environment
secretary.
   Ridley said the government has not decided whether it will
retain a 49 percent stake or a smaller interest in the companies
that will be created from the existing water authorities.
   Ridley said 28 so-called statutory water companies, which supply
water to the authorities, will be allowed to convert into
autonomous public companies when the authorities are privatized.
These companies currently operate under a range of legal
restrictions.
   French water companies and some of the British water authorities
already have acquired stakes in the statutory companies.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government has
sold off billions of pounds worth of state-owned companies since
1979. It believes these companies, such as British Airways PLC and
British Gas PLC, are more efficiently run privately.
   It also has sought to get more shares into the hands of the
public as a way of promoting capitalism.

<HEAD>GTE To Place Network Switching Business In Joint Venture With AT&T</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GTE Corp. is cutting back in the expensive and
competitive business of building telephone network switches by
turning over 49 percent of its operation to American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.
   GTE will own 51 percent of a joint venture with AT&T, then
reduce its ownership to 20 percent after five years and zero after
15 years, under an agreement in principle announced by the
companies Wednesday.
   The venture will consist of GTE's network switching business,
which employs about 2,000 workers in the Phoenix, Ariz., area and
about 3,000 in factories in the Chicago suburbs of Northlake and
Genoa, Ill.
   AT&T will give the joint venture licenses to use some of AT&T's
own advanced switching technology. It will continue to run its own
network switching business independently of the joint venture.
   AT&T dominates the U.S. market for network switches, which are
basically computers installed in the central offices of phone
companies that are loaded with complex software to handle high-tech
communications.
   The newest switches are being upgraded at enormous expense to
handle simultaneous transmission of voices, computer data, video
signals and other information over the same circuits.
   The deal eases GTE out of a costly business where it has been an
also-ran with about 10 percent of the market, consisting mainly of
the GTE local phone companies, said John Bain, an analyst for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Financial arrangements were not disclosed, but since GTE's
contribution is substantially larger it is reasonable to assume
that AT&T will be making some kind of payment to GTE, GTE spokesman
Thomas Mattausch said.
   GTE's customers should benefit because the joint venture will
work on enhancing GTE switches using the latest in AT&T technology,
the companies said. The companies' switches happen to be similar,
so there is plenty of room for sharing of technology, Mattausch
said.
   In the long term, AT&T is likely to steer GTE customers toward
AT&T switches, Bain predicted.
   GTE has reduced its involvement in other parts of the
communications equipment business in recent years by entering joint
ventures with West Germany's Siemens AG and Japan's Fujitsu Ltd.
   ITT Corp., following a similar pattern, reduced its involvement
in the network switching business at the end of 1986 by placing its
telecommunications equipment business in a European-based joint
venture with France's Compagnie Generale d'Electricite.

   Growth in personal income slowed in all but
three states during the first three months of 1988, barely keeping
ahead of inflation, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said growth in income in the 50 states
and the District of Columbia slowed to 0.8 percent in the
January-March period, compared with growth of 2.8 percent in the
final quarter of 1987.
   Despite the slowdown, incomes managed to stay slightly ahead of
the increase in prices, which was 0.6 percent in the first quarter
for personal consumption spending.
   Income in the 12 months ending March 31 expanded by 6.3 percent,
while inflation was 3.8 percent.
   Analysts attributed part of the cooling in the first quarter to
swings in farm subsidy payments, but other factors cited include:
   _Slower job growth in the January-March period after a strong
fourth quarter.
   _A decline in investment income as the Federal Reserve loosened
the reins on the money supply, pushing interest rates to their
lowest point so far this year.
   _An increase in bonuses and other payments to employees at the
end of the year, which made first quarter growth look less robust
by comparison.
   Mark Zandi, director of state forecasting for the Wefa Group, a
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm, said the pattern of faster
growth on the East and West coasts than in the nation's heartland
continued in the first quarter, but was less pronounced than in the
past.
   Incomes in the first quarter grew 1.1 percent in the Far West
and Southeast and 0.9 percent in New England and the Mid-Atlantic
states. In the inland regions, incomes fell 1.2 percent in the
Plains states, edged up 0.5 percent in the Southwest and rose 0.7
percent in both the Great Lakes and Rocky Mountain regions.
   ``We are starting to see more balanced regional growth,'' Zandi
said. ``The breadbasket of the country and the oil-producing states
were suffering from very severe recessions. Although not growing as
fast as the coasts, I wouldn't characterize them as suffering from
recession any longer.''
   Rudolph E. DePass, a Commerce Department analyst, noted that the
improvement in U.S. export sales is bolstering growth in regions
where manufacturing is important. However, the West Coast and
Southeastern states have been helped more than the so-called Rust
Belt ringing the Great Lakes.
   Zandi said the paper, plastics and textile industries of the
Southeast have been faster to see the benefits of the trade
turnaround than plants in the Great Lakes that produce durable
goods like heavy equipment and autos.
   Income dropped in six states, edged up in 42 states and the
District of Columbia and showed no growth in two. In all but three
states _ Oklahoma, Idaho and Montana _ income either fell or its
growth slowed from the fourth quarter.
   Residents of Montana saw their incomes shoot up by 6 percent
over the last three months of 1987, the biggest increase of any
state. Income in North Dakota jumped 4.1 percent (although growth
was still less strong than the fourth quarter), while income in
Oklahoma rose 2.4 percent and was up 2.3 percent in Idaho.
   Nebraska had the biggest decline, 6 percent, followed by Iowa,
4.2 percent, and South Dakota, 2.6 percent.
   Other states suffering declines or no growth were Alaska, down
1.1 percent; Minnesota, down 0.8 percent; Colorado, down 0.4
percent; and Texas and Utah, both with no change.
   The payment of corn subsidies at the end of last year made first
quarter income look worse in Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota, while
payment of wheat subsidies early this year boosted income in
Montana, North Dakota, Idaho and Oklahoma.
   Barley subsidies were an important factor in raising income in
Montana and Idaho, while cotton payments helped Oklahoma, which was
hurt by weak oil prices.
   Excluding farm income, Nevada showed the strongest growth, 2
percent, followed by Vermont and Virginia, 1.7 percent each.
   Alaska, the only state where non-farm incomes declined, slipped
1.0 percent. Oklahoma showed no growth, while Texas and Colorado
edged up only 0.1 percent. Weak oil prices were blamed for the poor
performance of incomes in those states, which are heavily dependent
on oil drillin and mining.
   Overall, personal income excluding farm payments rose 1 percent
in the 50 states, compared with 2.4 percent growth in the fourth
quarter. Over the 12 months ending March 31, non-farm income grew
6.5 percent.

   In a separate report, the Census Bureau said Wednesday that
after-tax income of the typical American household rose in 1986 for
the fifth consecutive year, but growth in black families' income
lagged and the income of female-headed households fell.
   The typical American household brought in $23,683 after taxes in
1986, up 2.6 percent from 1985 after adjusting for inflation.
However, taxes increased at an even faster 8 percent, boosting the
percentage of Americans' income consumed by taxes from 22.5 to 23.4.
   After-tax inome for white households grew 2.6 percent to an
average of $24,570, while for black households the average was
$16,398, up 1.9 percent. Income for Hispanic households averaged
$18,817, up 3 percent from a year earlier.
   Income for female-headed households with children but no husband
averaged $13,134, down 1.6 percent.

<HEAD>American Airlines' Profit Up 53.4 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of American Airlines
reported Wednesday that its earnings jumped 53.4 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, helped by strong passenger
traffic.
   AMR Corp. said its second-quarter earnings rose to $141.4
million, or $2.36 a share, from $92.2 million, or $1.51 a share, a
year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 18.1 percent, to $2.16 billion from
$1.83 billion in the year-earlier period.
   ``This is our best second quarter ever, with the exception of
1985, when we carried unusual amounts of traffic as a result of a
strike at a major competitor,'' AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall
said in a press statement.
   In 1985, United Airlines pilots were on strike, and American's
passenger share was boosted by the disruption in its competitor's
service.
   In addition to strong traffic, AMR's performance in the latest
quarter also was boosted by continuing efforts to control costs,
Crandall said.
   While it was pleased with the results, Crandall said AMR was
disappointed by the performance of two of its aircraft suppliers,
McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie. He said the two
manufacturers failed to meet commitments for aircraft deliveries,
which caused AMR's capacity to fall below expectations, increased
its unit costs and reduced its revenue.
   Airbus, an aircraft manufacturing consortium, is financed by the
governments of France, Britain, West Germany and Spain. It competes
intensely with U.S. rivals McDonnell Douglas and Boeing Co.
   In the first half of the year, the company's profit soared 87.2
percent _ to $209.8 million, or $3.47 a share, from $112.1 million,
or $1.88 a share, in the first six months of 1987.
   First-half revenue rose 23.6 percent, to $4.13 billion from
$3.34 billion a year earlier.
   American, based in Fort Worth, is the nation's second-largest
airline.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said Wednesday its profit
slipped 0.3 percent in the second quarter as revenue rose 4.3
percent.
   The two parents of US Sprint Communications Co. reported
improved results _ GTE Corp. had a 34 percent profit increase and
United Telecommunications Inc. made money again after posting a
loss a year earlier.
   US Sprint itself, the nation's third biggest long-distance
company after AT&T and MCI Communications Corp., had a pre-tax loss
of $112 million for the quarter. Its revenue jumped 46 percent.
   Pacific Telesis Group, the San Francisco-based regional Bell
holding company, said its earnings rose 21.6 percent in the quarter.
   AT&T said it earned $594 million, or 55 cents a share, down from
$596 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$8.76 billion from $8.40 billion.
   For the six months, profit rose 4.3 percent to $1.09 billion, or
$1.01 a share, from $1.04 billion, or 95 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 3.5 percent to $17.11 billion from $16.52
billion.
   ``These are good earnings and match last year's quarter _ our
best since divestiture,'' Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief
executive, said in a statement. ``But we aim to do better than
match.''
   Allen reiterated that the company expects to improve its
profitability this year.
   Product sales rose 14.5 percent from last year's second quarter,
reaching their highest level in three years, the company said. AT&T
said sales rose for private phone switches, computers, network
equipment, consumer products, microelectronic components and
products for the government.
   Revenue from services, largely long-distance, rose 2.8 percent.
   US Sprint's second-quarter loss was down from last year's $316
million, which included a special charge of $175 million to write
down Sprint's old network and make billing adjustments. Revenue
rose to $799 million from $546 million.
   GTE announced that its board had approved an agreement under
which it will sell 30.1 percent of its stake in US Sprint to United
Telecommunications early next year for book value, which will
probably exceed $600 million. That would leave GTE with a 19.9
percent share.
   GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., said its second-quarter earnings
would have been flat except for special factors. GTE earned $299
million, or 87 cents a share, up from $223 million, or 66 cents a
share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a $17 million
one-time accounting gain in contrast to a $54 million after-tax
charge against earnings in the second quarter of 1987 related to US
Sprint.
   Revenue rose 9 percent to $4.2 billion from roughly $3.85
billion.
   For the first half, GTE earned $586 million, or $1.71 a share,
compared with a profit of $488 million, or $1.44 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $8.2 billion from about $7.6
billion.
   United Telecommunications, based in Kansas City, Mo., said it
earned $41 million, or 40 cents a share, in the second quarter,
compared with a loss of $118.2 million a year earlier. Those 1987
results included a one-time charge of $54 million related to US
Sprint.
   Revenue, which does not include revenue from US Sprint, totaled
$772 million, up 6.2 percent from $727 million a year earlier.
   For the year to date, United Telecommunications' earnings
totaled $75.5 million, or 73 cents a share, compared to a loss of
$104.8 million a year earlier. Revenue excluding US Sprint rose to
$1.52 billion from $1.43 billion.
   Pacific Telesis Group's earnings were helped by consolidating
and restructuring during 1987, the company said.
   The company reported earnings of $321 million, or 76 cents a
share, on revenue of $2.37 billion during the second three months
of 1988, compared with earnings of $264 million, or 61 cents a
share, on revenue of $2.27 billion for the second quarter of 1987.
   For the six months, Pacific Telesis earned $621 million, or
$1.47 a share, on revenue of $4.67 billion, compared with $498
million, or $1.16 a share, on revenue of $4.41 billion during the
first two quarters of 1987.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded against most major
currencies in quiet, nervous trading Wednesday after retreating
overseas amid reports of some central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices were mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $444.50 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT,
down $1.25 from late Tuesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started out on a down note in
domestic trading after reports that the West German central bank
intervened twice to sell dollars in an effort to drive the currency
lower.
   However, they said reports of an anti-American demonstration by
Moslem pilgrims in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, helped boost the dollar
later in the trading session.
   ``I think there's a lot of uncertainty at this point as to where
we go from here,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a Harris Trust & Co.
currency trader. ``With the central-bank intervention we're losing
some of the bullish sentiment toward the dollar.''
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at Banco di Sicilia's New York
office, said the dollar would have traded higher had it not been
for fears of central banks intervening further to stem the
currency's recent rise.
   He said the Mideast demonstrations reported by Tehran Radio
showed ``the dollar is still a safe haven currency.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.80 yen to a closing 133.05 yen. It was
quoted at 133.25 yen in London. Later, in New York, the dollar
stood at 133.775 yen, up from 133.155.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7085 from $1.6937 late
Tuesday. The pound rose to $1.7054 in New York from $1.7038.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.8555 West German marks, up from
1.8535; 1.5392 Swiss francs, up from 1.5374; 1.19835 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.19735; 6.2535 French francs, up from 6.2515; and
1,373.00 Italian lire, down from 1,374.00.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday: 1.8520 West
German marks, down from 1.8640; 1.5360 Swiss francs, down from
1.5475; 6.2455 French francs, down from 6.2845; 2.0910 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1010; 1,371.50 Italian lire, down from
1,383.60; and 1.1959 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2011.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $444.80 per troy ounce from $446.50 late Tuesday.
   Gold was quoted at $444.80 a troy ounce in London, compared with
late Tuesday's bid of $437.00. In Zurich, the bid was $445 an
ounce, up from $436.50 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $7.86 an ounce to $446.84.
   The upward movement in gold abroad was attributed to inflation
fears and a miner's strike in Peru.
   On the New York Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose
to $7.827 per troy ounce from $7.727 late Tuesday. Silver was
quoted in London at a bid of $7.75 a troy ounce on Wednesday, up
from Tuesday's $7.13.

   Pratt & Whitney Aircraft said
Wednesday it is eliminating more than 1,000 white-collar jobs in a
move that will eventually save $100 million a year and enhance its
competitive position in the jet engine market.
   The company said 283 employees, ranging from engineers and
purchasing agents to vice presidents, would be laid off over the
next 18 months, including 158 who were let go immediately.
   The rest of the jobs, including 314 currently vacant positions,
will be eliminated through attrition and not renewing 181 personnel
contracts.
   Two more rounds of job reductions among the company's 19,370
salaried employees will be announced next month, said Curtis Linke,
a Pratt & Whitney spokesman.
   The first round of reductions will eventually save the company
an estimated $100 million a year, he said.
   ``Cost reductions are difficult but eliminating unnecessary
tasks and the reduction of staff are steps we must take to ensure a
healthy future for Pratt & Whitney and all our people,'' company
president Arthur E. Wegner said in a statement.
   Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corp. of
Hartford, Conn., has said a number of times over the past year that
it needed to lay off employees to remain competitive with its chief
rival, General Electric Co.
   Pratt & Whitney has about 45,700 salaried and hourly employees
worldwide, compared to 44,720 in 1982.
   ``It's nothing dramatic,'' said David Franus, an analyst at
Forecast International in Newtown, a market research firm that
follows the aerospace industry. ``It is part of an ongoing attempt
by Pratt & Whitney to pare its staff down, just to be leaner and
meaner and more cost effective with GE.''
   Philip Friedman, an analyst with Drexel Burhnam Lambert Inc. in
New York, said: ``The company for some time has been cutting costs
and restructuring. ... Certainly it will make them more competitive
in the jet engine market.''
   Also on Wednesday, another UTC division, Hamilton Standard of
Windsor Locks, announced Wednesday that about 200 hourly workers
and 20 salaried employees are being laid off. Hamilton Standard
makes space systems.
   Once the world's dominant jet engine builder, P&W saw its share
of the commercial market drop from 100 percent in 1974 to about 40
percent in 1987. General Electric's share grew during the same
period from nothing to 45 percent to 50 percent.
   Similar declines have occurred in Pratt & Whitney's military
business.
   General Electric's pre-tax profit margin on engines is about 16
percent compared to 8 percent for P&W, analysts have said.
   Pratt & Whitney said it is rebounding, however, with orders this
year running double the rate of last year.
   The first round of job reductions, announced Wednesday, affects
the company's commercial business in East Hartford, Linke said. The
government engine business in West Palm Beach, Fla., and
manufacturing operations in Connecticut, Columbus, Ga., and
Berwick, Maine, will be affected in future job reductions, Linke
said.
   The salaried employees laid off Wednesday will receive two
weeks' pay, plus one week of severance pay for every year of
service and a $3,000 lump-sum payment.
   Pratt & Whitney used retirement and severance incentives last
year to reduce its white-collar work force by about 2,000.
   Wegner told analysts late last year that further reductions in
the work force were planned in order to bring the size of the
company in line with a reduced production volume.
   Pratt & Whitney attempted last year to reopen contract
negotiations with the Machinists union so it could offer retirement
incentives and improved severance pay for workers laid off in the
future.
   Workers rejected the idea. Linke said Wednesday that there was
no evaluation of blue-collar staff now going on. The Machinists'
current contract expires in December 1988. The union represents
18,000 workers at Pratt & Whitney and Hamilton Standard in
Connecticut.
   George Almeida, grand lodge representative of the Machinists
union, said all of the approximately 500 hourly workers who have
been laid off by Pratt & Whitney in the past year have been called
back.
   Earlier this week, UTC announced that net income for the second
quarter increased 26 percent to $196.2 million, or $1.50 per share,
from $156 million, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.
   Robert Daniell, UTC chairman and chief executive officer,
predicted that the company would end 1988 with record results.

   Bethlehem Steel Corp. announced price
increases Wednesday ranging from 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent on
several types of widely used flat rolled steel.
   USX Corp., the nation's largest steelmaker, declined comment,
meanwhile, on rumors that it recently alerted customers to similar
price increases.
   Analysts said the Bethlehem move reflects tight supplies of
hot-rolled steel sheet and the prospects of continued strength in
general steel markets.
   ``It's part and parcel of what I see as a sharply improved steel
market,'' said J. Clarence Morrison, securities analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Bethlehem said the increases take effect Jan. 1, giving
customers time to plan for the higher prices.
   Bethlehem said the per ton price of hot rolled sheets will rise
by $15, or 3.5 percent, to $445, while the prices of cold rolled
and coated sheets will rise by $30 per ton, or up to 5.5 percent,
to as high as $651.
   Flat rolled steel is used in a variety of manufactured goods,
including office furniture and appliances. Automakers, major users
of sheet steel, negotiate prices with the producers.

   The stock market posted gains Wednesday in a
dull session dominated by program trading and activity in a handful
of takeover issues.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell about 32
points in the previous two sessions, climbed 13.34 to close at
2,110.60, its highest level of the day.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
851 issues up, 597 down and 503 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 151.99 million shares,
up from 144.11 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
178.88 million shares.
   The Dow remained in plus territory and above the psychologically
important 2,100 mark throughout the session.
   While bargain hunters were lured to the market after two days of
declining stock prices, analysts noted that a lot of cash remains
on the sidelines.
   ``Basically what happened most of the day is program-related,
and that keeps institutions on the sidelines,'' said Philip Puccio,
a senior vice president at Dillon, Read & Co.
   In addition to computer-triggered buy programs, a handful of
issues that are the subject of takeover bids and those rumored to
be takeover targets accounted for a substantial amount of trading
volume. Trading strategies designed to capture dividends also drove
up volume, analysts said.
   ``When you take out the dividend rolls and the takeover plays,
we're not really running at an institutional pace,'' Puccio said.
   Edward Nicoski, a technical analyst at Piper Jaffray & Hopwood
Inc. in Minneapolis, said the session was ``kind of blah.'' He
noted that the while blue-chip issues managed to post gains, ``the
secondary stocks were weak all day long.''
   Traders again were hit with a flurry of mostly favorable
second-quarter earnings reports, but they remained hesitant to
respond for fear the gains will be canceled out by higher interest
rates down the road.
   Analysts also said there was a sense of relief at the opening
after Tokyo's key Nikkei index of 225 selected issues finished
about 400 points higher, nearly erasing Tuesday's 500-point drop,
its largest decline this year.
   Many traders have been braced for a crack in the Japanese
market, which has recovered impressively from the October market
crash.
   Among actively traded issues, Polaroid jumped 6 to 40. Shamrock
Holdings offered to acquire the company for $40 a share.
   McGraw-Hill was up 3} at 64|. The company, which has been
mentioned as a potential takeover target, had no comment on the
rise in its stock.
   Maytag was up 2{ at 24|. The appliance company had no comment on
the rise, but rumors circulated in the market that the company may
be the target of a leveraged buyout.
   Travelers Corp., the Big Board's most actively traded issue,
rose [ to 36\; Columbia Gas was up { at 32], and Chase Manhattan
Bank was up { at 30. Each was the subject of dividend trading
strategies.
   Elsewhere, IBM was unchanged at 124; Honeywell was up 2 at 65];
Digital Equipment was down 1 at 107|, and AT&T was up ] at 26~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $11.37 billion, or 0.42
percent, in value.
   The NYSE index was up 0.76 at 152.56.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 1.85 to 312.03,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.53 at 270.00.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.79
to 309.18. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 391.63, up 0.35.

<HEAD>Ralston Purina Reports 39 Percent Increase In Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. on Wednesday announced its
third-quarter earnings jumped 39 percent on a modest increase in
sales.
   The company, which makes food products and batteries, said net
income for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $77.2 million, or
$1.13 per share, compared with net earnings of $55.7 million, or 78
cents a share a year ago.
   Revenue increased 4 percent to $1.47 billion, from $1.40 billion
in the third fiscal quarter of 1987.
   For the year-to-date, Ralston-Purina reported net earnings of
$302.9 million, or $4.38 a share, on sales of $4.52 billion,
compared with net earnings of $426.1 million, or $5.83 a share, on
sales of $4.36 billion for the first nine months of the last fiscal
year.
   The St. Louis-based company attributed the earnings increase for
the nine-month period partly to lower tax rates and improved
operating results, especially in human and pet foods operations.
   Eveready Battery profits also increased on a strong
international performance, with improved volumes reported primarily
in Asia and Europe, the company said. For the third quarter,
however, operating profit for battery products declined slightly
from the previous year because of increased consumer and trade
promotion spending in the United States.

<HEAD>Reports 47 Percent Drop In Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Dynamics Corp. on Wednesday reported a
47 percent decrease in second-quarter earnings, due in part to
costs in its Electric Boat Division.
   For the second quarter, its profit amounted to $66.7 million, or
$1.58 a share, on net sales of $2.34 billion, compared with net
earnings of $125.1 million, or $2.92 a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter sales fell to $2.34 billion from $2.41 billion
last year.
   For the first half of the year, the company reported net
earnings of $172.4 million, or $4.10 a share, on net sales of $4.74
billion, compared iwth net earnings of $230.5 million, or $5.37 a
share, on net sales of $4.66 billion for the same six months in
1987.
   Earnings for both periods were boosted by $20 million from tax
law changes resulting in reductions of deferred taxes, the defense
contractor said.
   The second-quarter results included a charge of $33 million
after taxes associated with the SSN 688-Class Attack Submarine
program at Electric Boat Division, the company said.
   The company said costs of operations at Electric Boat Division
have been rising since the first quarter of 1987, mostly because of
problems associated with the installation of a new integrated
combat system in the attack submarine and to higher overhead rates
because the company did not win any submarine awards in fiscal 1987.
   The company said the division's second-quarter charge reflected
losses from resolution of the company's request for equiptable
adjustment associated with the design and installation of the new
combat system, from higher costs of rescheduling work into future
periods and from the strike by 10,000 shipyard workers at the
Groton, Conn., facility, which is now in its third week.

<HEAD>Soybean Prices Plunge For Third Day As Rain Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain in the Farm Belt sent soybean futures prices plunging the
permissable limit again Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade but
analysts said a new forecast for a return to hot, dry weather could
end the slide at three days.
   In other action on the Board of Trade, oat futures fell sharply,
wheat was lower and corn was mixed.
   On other markets, sugar prices plummeted; silver rose while gold
fell; livestock and meat were mostly lower; and energy futures
advanced.
   Prices for some soybean contracts and nearly all oat contracts
fell their permissable limits as scattered rain fell in parts of
Indiana, Illinois and Arkansas, marking the fifth straight day that
showers had touched some part of the Midwest.
   The precipitation came too late to save much of the corn crop
but for soybeans, ``the rains came right at the right exact time
and in areas where they needed it,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   He said soybean farmers in the South finished planting last week
while the Midwestern soybean crop has begun forming pods.
   The most critical period for soybean growth will occur from
mid-August through early September, when the pods fill with beans,
said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst in New York with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc.
   ``The pod-filling is really like the last chance,'' Balletto
said ``That's when you've got to have the weather if you've got any
chance of getting decent yields.''
   Hot, dry weather will return to most of the Midwest by the
middle of next week, the National Weather Service predicted in a
6-to-10-day forecast issued after the close.
   Balletto said the forecast could have a bullish impact on crop
futures on Thursday.
   Corn futures fell sharply in early trading but recovered to
close mixed on news that the American Farm Bureau had reduced its
corn-production estimate to 4.5 billion bushels from 4.8 million.
   Wheat futures prices were pressured by disappointment that some
expected export business with China and India had failed to
materialize, Spilka said.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 11 cents lower with July at $3.65 a
bushel; corn was 16 cents lower to 5 cents higher with July at
$2.92{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 20 cents lower with July at
$2.70 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 45{ cents lower with
July at $8.29 a bushel.
   Soybean prices are limited to moves of 45 cents a bushel and
oats are limited to 15 cents a bushel except for the July
contracts, on which the limits have been removed pending the
expiration of those contracts at noon on Thursday.
   World sugar prices collapsed on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange on unconfirmed rumors that the Soviet Union would not make
any additional sugar purchases before their October harvest, said
Judith Ganes, an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   The Soviets are believed to have purchased as much as 200,000
metric tons of sugar last week, she said. Traders expected them to
buy another 500,000 metric tons before October.
   The contract for October delivery settled 1.13 cents lower at
14.17 cents a pound.
   Fears that a two-day miners' walkout in Peru could become an
indefinite strike propelled silver futures prices sharply higher on
New York's Commodity Exchange.
   The strike began Monday night and the government has refused to
budge on the workers' demands for higher wages, said Bernard
Savaiko, metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Peru is the world's second-largest silver producer behind Mexico.
   Gold settled $1.30 to $1.80 lower with August at $445.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 9.3 cents to 10 cents higher with July at $7.827
a troy ounce.
   Lower cash prices and lower soybean futures prices pressured
most livestock and meat futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
analysts said.
   Hog futures were hit particularly hard on expectations that the
Midwestern rains and cooler temperatures would prompt increased
marketings.
   Live cattle were .63 cent lower to .33 cet higher with August at
64.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .53 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with August at 75.57 cents a pound; hogs were the limit 1.50
cents lower to .55 cent higher with July at 47.20 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.15 cents lower to .05 cent higher with
July at 35.75 cents a pound.
   Oil futures advanced in volatile trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 47 cents higher
with August at $15.60 cents a barrel; heating oil was 1.20 cents to
1.75 cents higher with August at 44.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at 50.85
cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Roy E. Disney, who followed his famous
uncle Walt in making cartoons and nature shows, is the low-key king
of a magic financial kingdom of stocks, broadcast companies and a
big stake in the family fantasy business.
   The $2.64 billion offer Disney made Wednesday for Polaroid Corp.
through his Shamrock Holdings Inc. is his most ambitious gambit yet
as a financial gamesman, but has ample precedent.
   Shamrock, an investment vehicle for Disney and his family, has
traded in companies as diverse as an Indiana soybean processor, a
Los Angeles record store chain and a Hawaii television station.
   Disney himself, son of Walt's brother and business partner Roy
O. Disney, is credited with creating the management team that has
brought off a Cinderella-style corporate turnaround at Walt Disney
Co.
   Associates describe Disney, 57, as an unassuming family man who
can make hard-nosed business decisions.
   He goes to work in the Shamrock office building near Disney in
Burbank in deck shoes and short-sleeved shirts and lives in a house
in the nearby Los Angeles suburb of Toluca Lake.
   Disney spends his spare time with his wife, Patricia, and four
grown children, and as the hands-on skipper of his 70-foot racing
sloop, Pyewacket.
   Disney is a regular entrant in the Trans-Pacific sailing race
from California to Hawaii, finished third this year in the Memorial
Day California Cup race and is a respected competitor, said Frank
Gleberman, commodore of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey.
   ``There are owners who go along for the ride and there are
owners who are competitors, and he is one of the latter,''
Gleberman said. ``He's thorough and aggressive.''
   Disney has spent his working life at the family's company, in
general management and producing television cartoons and the
trademark Disney nature shows.
   In 1984, disenchanted with the management of the company by Walt
Disney's son-in-law, Ronald Miller, Roy Disney quit the company's
board, brought in the investing Bass brothers of Texas as allies in
fending off two outside takeover attempts and ended up in control
of the Disney empire.
   Working with his attorney and associate Stanley Gold, Disney
installed Michael Eisner and Frank Wells as chairman and president
and has helped the company rebound with renewed vigor at its
amusement parks and its wildly successful new movie studio,
Touchstone.
   A decade ago, Disney formed Shamrock to diversify his
investments, though his family's 4 million shares of Disney _ worth
$251.5 million based on Wednesday's closing price _ form Shamrock's
backbone.
   Shamrock owns television stations KITV in Honolulu, KEYT in
Santa Barbara, Calif., and WTVQ in Lexington, Ky. and 14 radio
stations. In addition to a large investment portfolio and extensive
real estate holdings in the West and in Hawaii, the company owns 22
percent of Enterra Crop., a Houston-based oilfiled services company.
   Shamrock officials will not disclose the closely-held company's
value, but a slick publicity brochure says its revenue ``would rank
it comfortably in the top half of the Fortune 500.'' Forbes
magazine estimated Shamrock's net worth at $400 million in 1986.
   With Disney as chairman and Gold as president and chief
executive officer running the day-to-day operations, the company
takes an active hand managing its investments and in seeking new
ones.
   Shamrock said in 1987 it made $125 million on the sale of
Central Soya Co. Inc. of Fort Wayne, Ind., to an Italian company.
Shamrock had bought Central Soya two years earlier for $303 million
in a leveraged buyout.
   Shamrock has scored gains on short-term investments in the likes
of Mobile Communications Corp. of America and Orion Capital Corp.
Its most recent acquisition was Music Plus, a 56-outlet chain of
record stores in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   Federal insurors Wednesday gave preliminary
approval to a merger of two giant Texas bank holding companies,
promising $475 million worth of assistance in the deal.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it will help two
Minnesota companies invest in the merger and recapitalization of
Fort Worth-based Texas American Bancshares Inc. and San
Antonio-based National Bancshares Corp.
   Stanley J. Poling, director of the FDIC's Dallas office, said
existing shareholders in the two Texas companies would initially
own five percent of the equity interests of the new firm, which has
not yet been named.
   The two Minneapolis-based companies, MEI Diversified Inc. and
Bank Shares Inc., led by Carl R. Pohlad, will invest $200 million
in the merger.
   Pohlad said the new company would become the fourth largest bank
holding company in Texas, with about $8 billion in assets and 63
banking offices.
   Insurors chose Pohlad over two Texas investor groups to help in
the merger.
   Pohlad thinks the merger will be completed by the end of the
year.
   ``I think the Texas economy has bottomed out,'' Pohlad said at a
press conference. ``I really think it's going to get better.
   The 72-year-old Pohlad also owns baseball's 1987 world champion
Minnesota Twins.
   Texas American lost $195 million in 1986 and 1987 and $17.8
million in this year's first quarter. National Bancshares lost $96
million in the two years and $11.4 million in the first quarter.
   As of March, problem loans at the two companies had reached
nearly $900 million.

<HEAD>New York Times Reports Profit Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Times Co. on Wednesday reported a 2
percent increase in its second-quarter net income, which was
adversely affected by lower advertising volume and labor problems
at its flagship New York Times.
   Net income for the quarter ended June 30 totaled $45.1 million,
or 55 cents a share, up from $44.1 million, or 54 cents a share, in
the year-ago period.
   Revenue for the quarter increased 7 percent to $456.4 million
from $426.3 million in the second quarter of 1987.
   Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement that although second-quarter operating results were
``adversely impacted by lower advertising volume and job actions by
the Newspaper Mail and Deliverers Union, we have continued to
invest heavily in the development of many of our properties.''
   Operating profit generated by the company's newspaper group,
which is comprised of The New York Times, 35 regional papers and a
one-third interest in the International Herald Tribune, declined 17
percent to $64.6 million on revenue of $360.1 million.
   Higher newsprint prices affected the papers. Advertising linage
at The Times was off 3.4 percent during the quarter, while 32 of
the regional papers posted a 4 percent gain in advertising.
   Job actions by the mail and deliverers union have stopped, but
no agreement has been reached, the company noted.
   Profit increased about 4 percent in the magazine group to $5.8
million on revenue of $68.7 million. Strong performances by Family
Circle and Golf Digest had a favorable impact on the group.
   Broadcasting and cable operations reported a 7 percent gain in
profit, which totaled $4.8 million on revenue of $27.6 million. The
company reported that an increased number of subscribers to its NYT
Cable TV helped offset continued softness in national spot
television advertising.
   For the first six months, the company reported net income of
$90.6 million, or $1.11 a share, up 6 percent from net income of
$85.2 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue
totaled $886.7 million, up 6 percent from $835.3 million a year ago.

<HEAD>Hard Rock Cafe Owner Agrees To Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard Rock International PLC, owner of seven Hard
Rock Cafe restaurants in six countries, has agreed to a $107
million buyout by Pleasurama PLC, a British leisure industry
holding company.
   Pleasurama agreed to acquire Hard Rock's class A restricted
voting shares for 1 pound a share, or about $1.70 at current
exchange rates. Hard Rock stock traded in this country as American
Depositary Shares, each equalling five class A shares, would be
bought for 5 pounds per ADS.
   Pleasurama also will acquire all of Hard Rock's regular common
shares through a cash tender offer in the United Kingdom, the
company said. That offer does not apply to class A shares or ADSs.
   The overall buyout was conditioned on completion of that tender
offer, a planned $216.5 million rights offering to fund the buyout,
and approval by Hard Rock shareholders and British regulators. Hard
Rock's board of directors already has approved the takeover.
   Hard Rock is most famous for its string of restaurants, which
offer American-style food accompanied by blaring music and an
eclectic decor featuring rock 'n' roll artifacts. It also
merchandises the Hard Rock name on souvenirs, t-shirts and other
items.
   Hard Rock International owns Hard Rock Cafes in New York;
London; Dallas; Tokyo; Reykjavik, Iceland; Cancun, Mexico; and
Stockholm.
   Hard Rock co-founder Isaac Tigrett was expected to remain in
charge of the restaurant business, according to a spokesman.
   Tigrett founded the business in 1971 with former partner Peter
Morton, and after a split several years ago retained rights to the
Hard Rock name everywhere but the United States west of Chicago and
in Australia and Brazil.
   Pleasurama is the holding company for a diversified British
leisure group that includes hotels, vacations, casinos, property
development and amusement machines.

   Share prices dipped during morning trading Thursday
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the U.S. dollar gained ground
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 404.95-point
winner Wednesday, retreated 135.11 points to finish the morning
session at 27,418.87.
   Stock brokers attributed the turnaround of the market's most
widely followed index to profit-taking following the major gain on
Wednesday.
   ``The environment is not poor,'' said a broker at Nikko
Securities Co, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``I don't see
many negative factors today. Shares should regain strength after
absorbing the profit-taking.''
   Brokers said electronics shares, most of which soared Wednesday,
were weak Thursday morning.
   The dollar, which lost 0.80 yen Wednesday, opened up 0.60 yen at
133.65 yen following the strong showing of the U.S. currency
overnight in New York, and was changing hands at 133.80 yen by late
morning.
