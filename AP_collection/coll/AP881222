   Six children were killed and four other family
members injured Thursday when a fire broke out in their home,
officials said.
   Fourteen people, all members of the same family, lived in the
narrow, one-story home that was heavily damaged by the fire shortly
before 6 a.m., said fire Capt. John Welch. Some were able to escape
by jumping out windows, but the children, 13 and under, were trapped.
   Flames were spewing from the windows ``just like an inferno,''
said neighbor Myrtle Bell. ``The kids inside were screaming. They
just couldn't get no help.''
   The fire apparently started in a kerosene space heater in the
basement of the home, Welch said.
   ``The father woke up and saw one of the sons adjusting or doing
something with the heater, and then there was a flash,'' Welch said.
   Lt. Joe Marcinkiewicz said investigators were trying to determine
whether the heater was defective or if it was being filled with the
wrong type of fuel.
   ``Possibly he was adding gasoline rather than kerosene,''
Marcinkiewicz said. ``That happens all too much.''
   Marcinkiewicz identified the victims as Tony Harris, 13; Antonio
Hurn, 8; Jerrly Brooks, 4; Terrly Harris, 2; Rodney B. Davis, 1; and
Tierra Hurn, 1.
   Four people were taken to Barnes Hospital.
   Joe Hurn, 42, was listed in serious condition, with burns over 10
percent of his body, said hospital spokesman John Miller.
   Hurn's wife, Rosalie, 40, their daughter-in-law, Katrina Harris,
22, and Cochee Hurn, 14, also were listed in serious condition,
suffering from smoke inhalation, Miller said.
   The heater had been placed in front of the basement's outside
door, prohibiting exit, Welch said. Windows and doors at the back of
the house had metal bars on them.

   A man who allegedly tried to ship a $1.1 million
mainframe computer to a Soviet-bloc country has been arrested,
breaking up a large high-technology smuggling network, the U.S.
Customs Service said Thursday.
   Customs said the investigation covered six U.S. cities and eight
foreign countries, including Libya, Iran and Iraq.
   The computer, a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8800, has military
and civilian applications, and the man was trying to ship it to
Bulgaria, the center for computer technolgy in the Soviet bloc, said
Patrick O'Brien, special Customs agent in charge in Miami.
   The computer can upgrade and control systems that launch and
guide ballistic missiles, operate radar or run a mass-transit
system, Customs said. It is on a federal list that regulates the
export of technologically advanced products.
   The computer, which likely would have been used by the Soviet
defense system, was seized last week at Miami International Airport,
O'Brien said.
   Search warrants were being served at U.S. companies that
manufacture VAX-type computers, the system most highly sought by the
Soviets, officials said.
   ``Four or five make this kind,'' said Dexter Lehtinen, U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of Florida. ``They all will be
checked out'' for possible involvement with the smuggling network,
he said.
   Neither Lehtinen nor Customs would identify the companies.
   O'Brien said Customs arrested Eddy Gorandus Haak, a Dutch
national, on Dec. 14 after he paid $50,000 in Swiss francs to
undercover agents. They had promised to help Haak smuggle the
computer to Bulgaria.
   The arrest and seizure followed an eight-month investigation and
left the smuggling network ``in disarray,'' O'Brien said.
   Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan said more arrests are expected
in both Chicago and Boston, where search warrants were being served.
   Customs said the investigation covered activity in Boston,
Chicago, New York, Newark, N.J., Houston, Great Lakes Beach, Mich.;
and Belgium, Austria, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Libya, Iran and
Iraq.
   O'Brien said the smuggling network has purchased and diverted
numerous VAX computers systems this year. Those computer systems and
others smuggled to Soviet countries in the past several years are
worth tens of millions of dollars, Customs said.
   ``Their whole defense system is converting to the VAX,'' O'Brien
said at a news conference. ``But they cannot build their own. The
only way they can get it is through the United States.
   ``If we can deny them from taking ours, they have to build the
factories,'' he said. ``It comes out of their defense budget and
really slows them down.''
   ``By getting one of these computers, they have saved themselves
10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in research and
development,'' Sheehan said. ``These countries are walking from the
Stone Age into the 21st century in one step at the expense of the
United States, and they're using this technology for interests
contrary to United States interests.''
   Haak, 42, is a resident of Belsele, Belgium. A grand jury
returned a three-count indictment charging him with conspiring to
illegally export computer equipment from the United States to
Bulgaria.
   If convicted of all counts, Haak could receive a maximum sentence
of 35 years in prison and a $5.75 million fine.
   Haak appeared before a federal magistrate Thursday and was denied
bond because of the likelihood he would flee from the United States,
Lehtinen said.

   Merryle Stanley Rukeyser, a pioneer of
financial journalism who wrote columns for Hearst Newspapers and
International News Service for more than 30 years, died Wednesday at
age 91.
   Rukeyser died at White Plains Hospital.
   Rukeyser also lectured and wrote nine books on financial
subjects. His sons, Louis and William, became prominent economics
journalists, and M.S. ``Bud'' Rukeyser Jr. became a major television
executive.
   The Chicago-born Rukeyser was raised in New York City and began
his newspaper career at 17, while attending Columbia University. He
worked summers as a reporter for the Rockaway News and as assistant
sports editor for the New York Morning Telegraph.
   He joined the New York Tribune in 1917, after his graduation, and
in 1920, at age 23, became the newspaper's financial editor.
   He moved to a similar post at the New York Evening Journal from
1923 to 1926 and the following year began writing his financial
columns for Hearst and INS, an assignment that lasted until 1957.
   He also returned to Columbia as a teacher in the School of
Journalism from 1918 to 1935 and as a student, earning a master's
degree in economics in 1925.
   In 1958, he began a syndicated column, Everybody's Money, which
he wrote for several years before cutting back on his work.
   He continued to lecture at least once a year until a year ago,
said his son, Louis.
   ``He called that his annual senility test, to see if he could
deliver a one-hour lecture on economics without notes,'' said Louis
Rukeyser, host of public television's ``Wall Street Week.'' The
senior Rukeyser sometimes appeared on his son's television program,
most recently in November 1987.
   Rukeyser's last book, ``Collective Bargaining, the Power to
Destroy,'' was published in 1968.
   Rukeyser's first wife, Berenice, did in 1964 after 24 years of
marriage. His second wife, Marjorie, died in 1974.
   Survivors include four sons, M.S. ``Bud'' Jr.; Louis; William;
and Robert J.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to 4-Year Prison Term for Knowingly Spreading AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet woman who knew she carried the AIDS virus
has been sentenced to four years in prison for defying doctor's
orders to refrain from sexual relations to avoid spreading the
disease, a newspaper reported.
   The prison term given the 31-year-old woman, identified only as
``Olga L.'' by the newspaper Socialist Industry, was believed to be
the first under a tough government measure aimed at stopping the
spread of AIDS.
   The Council of Ministers in August 1987 warned Soviets that
infecting others with the virus would be punished as a crime, and
said anyone in the Soviet Union could be forced to take an AIDS
antibody test.
   Socialist Industry said in Wednesday's report taht Olga had been
married to an African student and left with him for the Congo. After
four years, she returned to her homeland ``without a husband but
with AIDS.''
   Doctors discovered she was carrying the virus after she fell off
a balcony at a restaurant in the southern Ukraine city of Kakhovka
and took a routine blood sample when giving her first aid.
   Apparently Olga, though carrying the AIDS virus, showed none of
its symptoms. ``A carrier of the disease is not yet sick, but is
capable of spreading the infection,'' Socialist Industry noted.
   Olga was treated at a Moscow clinic, where on discharge doctors
warned her: ``no intimate relations,'' the paper said.
   But she ``paid no heed to these words, the number of her partners
even increased.'' The newspaper said. Eight of them have already
been identified, and authorities are searching for more, it said.
   Authorities orginally confined Olga to Kakhovka, but she fled. A
local court then sentenced her to a four-year prison term.
   In September 1987, a suspected AIDS carrier from Leningrad,
Lyudmila L., signed a pledge to refrain from sexual activity for
five years. If she reneges, she risks a prison term of up to eight
years, Soviet press acounts said at the time.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Blind Eye Turned To Document `Black Market'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon employees, contractors and defense
consultants regularly deal in a ``black market'' of classified
Defense Department documents, and the government has closed its eyes
to the practice for at least five years, congressional investigators
say.
   A staff report of the congressional Joint Economic Committee,
released Wednesday, said the Pentagon's internal investigators
discovered the practice in 1983 and sought to bring it to the
attention of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and the Justice
Department.
   But efforts to sound the alarm were ignored by higher-ups,
leading some subordinates to believe the practice was condoned,
according to testimony at a hearing of the panel's national security
subcommittee.
   In a practice that strongly parallels the pattern in the current
Pentagon procurement fraud case, outside defense consultants would
develop sources inside the Pentagon who could furnish them with
classified data, the report said. Documents included secret bid
specifications for weapons systems and long-range defense
acquisition plans.
   It could not be determined whether Pentagon employees were paid
for the documents, the investigators testified.
   The consultants then sold the secrets to contractors who could
use them to get an edge on their competitors, at the same time
depriving the government of the cost-saving benefits of open
competition, the investigation concluded.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., the subcommittee chairman, said at
the hearing the practice is even worse than the procurement fraud
scandal because it involves not just business information, but
secrets that if revealed could damage national security.
   The practice, which witnesses said involved at least two dozen
defense contractors, is continuing, said Donald Mancuso, an
assistant Pentagon inspector general.
   John F. Donnelly, director of the Defense Investigative Service,
told the hearing eight of them are still under investigation.
   He identified those as Boeing Co., General Dynamics Corp., Litton
Systems Inc., Martin Marietta Corp., McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
Northrop Corp., Sanders Associates Inc. and TRW Inc. The Pentagon is
investigating seven of the contractors while the FBI is
investigating the eighth, he said later.
   In a related development, the inspector general's office
announced a record 596 firms were barred in fiscal 1988 from doing
business with the military, and more than 4,000 people, most in
uniform, were convicted of contracting misdeeds in just the last
half of the year.
   The report to Congress suggested department auditors are becoming
more effective at finding waste, fraud and mismanagement. But it
also was a reminder that industry wrongdoing remains pervasive.
   The Joint Economic Committee's report noted that Pentagon
investigators unearthed the ``black market'' in secret documents in
1983 while investigating an employee in California of GTE Corp., a
defense contractor. The documents were obtained outside normal
channels through a private consultant. A similar investigation in
Ohio involving the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
surfaced at about the same time.
   But when investigators went to Pentagon superiors for support in
broadening their investigation, their requests were largely ignored,
the report said.
   Only the GTE case went to court, where it is still pending.
Lawyers for the contractor have contended in their defense that
unauthorized possession of classified program, planning and budget
documents is widespread in the industry.
   By 1984, the Pentagon investigators had linked Defense Department
officials, consultants and 25 contractors suspected of trafficking
in classified documents. A memorandum from Pentagon Inspector
General Joseph Sherick said consultants, ``acting as information
brokers, sell these documents to a number of major defense
contractors.''
   Some of the information ``would be of such value to hostile
powers that it could not even be declassified for court use,''
Sherick wrote.
   But Sherick's memo, intended for Weinberger, never got past the
Pentagon general counsel, Chapman B. Cox, the report said.
   That and other information provide ``conclusive evidence that the
government has indeed known for several years about the trafficking
of classified and other sensitive documents and has simply failed to
stop it,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who attended the
hearing. ``The government was asleep at the switch.''

   Stung by cries of ``grinch,'' planning
commissioners are trying to write some yuletide spirit into an
ordinance that inadvertently made lawbreakers out of most of the
city's Christmas tree dealers.
   The city's building inspections department presented eviction
notices earlier this month to 14 of the 17 outdoor Christmas tree
dealers in this Grand Rapids' suburb, including the Wyoming Park
High School Band Boosters.
   The evictions resulted from an ordinance enacted last summer to
ban outdoor sales.
   ``When we passed that ordinance, frankly, no one thought about
Christmas trees,'' Gerald Mears, head of Wyoming's planning and
inspections departments, told planning commissioners Tuesday.
   The dealers were told to clear the trees off their lots or pay a
$110 application for a zoning variance, prompting Councilman Edward
Frederick to call Mears a ``Grinch.''
   At their latest meeting, the council ordered that all Christmas
tree dealers should be left alone this year and that new language
allowing their continued operation be written into the law.
   ``It was not our intention to stop Christmas,'' said Councilman
Michel Hill.

   How do you wrap a Christmas pickle? And
what about the pressing problem of wrapping an ironing board in a
pretty holiday package?
   Those were just some of the dilemmas that faced the volunteers
this year at a gift-wrapping booth in the North Platte Mall.
   ``We've done a dill pickle, an ironing board, a boat ladder and
an ornamental yard windmill,'' said Eva Weber, a volunteer at the
booth run by the North Platte Church of God.
   By the time the booth closes on Christmas Eve, the 15 volunteers
from the tiny congregation of 35 will have wrapped an estimated
2,000 packages.
   ``We use about 6,000 bows over Christmas,'' said Sheri Clark,
whose husband, Bob, is the minister of the church.
   Proceeds from the booth provide the church with money for
community and mission work.
   The volunteers said an important part of their job is to
``scrounge the Dumpsters'' for odd-sized boxes.
   ``We want the finished product to look professional. We take a
lot of pride in how we do the job,'' Mrs. Weber said.
   Even that special Christmas pickle.

   Roy Collette will need a jackhammer and a
torch this year to open the annual Christmas gag gift of a
2-decade-old pair of moleskin pants from his brother-in-law Larry
Kunkel.
   The gift was delivered to his home Saturday in this southeastern
Minnesota city via flatbed semi-truck in a concrete-filled container
resembling a space capsule.
   As the truck moved slowly up the street, Collette acknowledged he
was in for a heavy job of unwrapping.
   ``There are three axles underneath the trailer. That tells you
something,'' he said, calling the whole business ``foolishness.''
   Kunkel and his crew of six volunteers spent 45 minutes unloading
the gift by crane and setting it upright in the driveway.
   Collette merely repeated: ``He's gonna pay for this one.''
   The ``package'' weighs several tons, stands more than 12 feet
high, measures 8 feet in diameter and comes with a U.S. flag.
Printed on the capsule, which is actually the barrel of a concrete
mixer, are the words ``United States Command Module Roy ``88.''
   The moleskin pants, circa 1964, are in a gas can somewhere inside.
   They've plagued the brothers-in-law for more than 20 years. They
originated as a gift to Kunkel from his mother. He discovered the
cotton, fake suede pants stiffened in cold weather and gave them to
Collette, who found them just as unappealing.
   Collette wrapped them up and returned them to Kunkel one
Christmas and the exchange continued each year until Collette
packaged them in a bucket of cement. But Kunkel managed to extract
them.
   The packaging has become increasingly elaborate as the men try to
out-wrap each other.
   Last year, the brothers-in-law agreed to end the prank. They were
going to tie the pants to the trunks of their vehicles, split them
in half and burn them. But Collette added a twist. With a slip of
the rope, the pants went sailing off, fully intact, behind Kunkel's
vehicle.

<HEAD>Taxpayers Due For Annual Greetings From Uncle Sam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uncle Sam's annual greetings to taxpayers are
ready to be mailed to 101 million Americans, complete with an
estimate of how long taxpayers can expect to spend filling out the
forms.
   The Internal Revenue Service previewed the new tax forms at a
briefing Wednesday, supplying plenty of words of assurance that
taxpayers should find preparing their returns relatively simple this
year compared to the last filing season.
   That's because there are few changes being made in the new forms,
unlike last year when taxpayers had to confront for the first time
the sweeping changes made by the landmark 1986 Tax Reform Act.
   While there had been dire predictions that befuddled taxpayers
would throw up their hands in despair because they couldn't
comprehend the new law, the IRS said the filing process went
relatively smoothly.
   ``Millions of Americans were asked to handle some very big tax
changes and they did so with a minimum of fuss and far fewer
mistakes than any of the so-called experts had predicted,'' said
Arthur Altman, chairman of the IRS forms committee.
   Altman said the IRS was delivering a double dose of good news
this year: there are far fewer changes, and the modifications that
have been made should help clear up confusion uncovered in the first
use of the forms.
   ``The 1987 returns that taxpayers did last year will serve as an
excellent reference point for preparing their new returns. And the
few changes that we did make will make life easier for them,''
Altman said.
   Altman said one section which was overhauled concerned the
standard deduction taken by people who do not itemize. Last year,
many people either forgot to reduce their taxable income by the
amount of the deduction or used the wrong number.
   In an effort to simplify things, taxpayers this year will be
directed to a section in the instructions which will provide
guidelines on which figures to use.
   One of the biggest changes in the forms this year will not be
noticeable because it is incorporated into the tax tables. That
change will reflect the final reduction in individual tax rates
required under the 1986 law.
   The new rates, which have been used to compute the amounts
withheld from paychecks since last January, tax most Americans at
levels of 15 percent or 28 percent.
   In addition to cutting tax rates significantly, the new tax law
almost doubled personal exceptions, reduced or eliminated several
itemized deductions and boosted the standard deduction for
non-itemizers.
   For the first time, the IRS will be supplying estimates of how
long taxpayers can expect to spend filling out their returns.
   For a taxpayer using the standard Form 1040, the IRS estimates it
will require nine hours and 17 minutes to keep the records, study
the instructions and fill out the form.
   This does not count an additional 5 hours and 51 minutes the
agency estimates a taxpayer will need to fill out an accompanying
Schedule A, used if the taxpayer itemizes deductions, and Schedule
B, used to list income from interest and dividends.
   By contrast, the IRS estimated that the average taxpayer only
needs 58 minutes to fill out the 1040EZ, the simplest IRS form which
can be used only by single people who do not itemize and who have
taxable income below $50,000.
   The agency listed these changes for the 1988 forms:
   _The individual exemption for a taxpayer, his spouse and each
dependent has been increased from $1,900 to $1,950.
   _The standard deduction for those who do not itemize has been
increased for 1988. For a single person the deduction will go from
$2,540 to $3,000. The deduction for a married couple filing jointly
will rise from $3,760 to $5,000.
   _Taxpayers will be able to claim an earned income credited for
1988 if they earned less than $18,576 and a child lived with them.
Last year, the income limit was $15,432.
   _The rules governing deductions for home mortgage interest were
liberalized in such a way that taxpayers who had their interest
deduction limited in 1987 will likely be able to deduct more in 1988.
   In some cases, taxpayers will find they will need to mail their
returns to a different processing center this year as the IRS tries
to redistribute its workload to better reflect population changes.
   Taxpayers living in Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi,
Minnesota and Virginia will send their returns to different
addresses this year. Taxpayers were advised to use the envelope that
comes with their tax package or see the ``Where to File'' section of
the instructions.
   The IRS traditionally begins mailing out the new forms on the day
after Christmas to allow taxpayers plenty of time to prepare the
returns, which must be mailed back by April 15.
   The forms, which this year cost $29.4 million to print and mail,
have been waiting at post offices for the past several weeks with
instructions to begin delivery on Dec. 27.

<HEAD>For 30 Years, Friends Send Same Card At Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Mary Beth Blakeman sent her
dearest high school friend a Christmas card in 1958, she didn't
expect to get the card back the next year.
   But she did, and 30 years later, Blakeman, 45, of Okauchee, and
Lenora Mulock, 46, of Menomonee Falls, are still sending the
time-worn greeting card when the holiday season rolls around.
   ``That's usually the first thing I look for in the mail,'' Mulock
said.
   Blakeman said the two were sophomores at Menomonee Falls High
School in 1958.
   That's when Mulock read a newspaper story about two men staying
in contact by re-using the same card each year, and she decided to
give it a try.
   ``We were inseparable in high school. This helped us keep in
touch. We'd get the card each year, call each other and laugh. We'll
probably keep sending it until one of us dies.''
   The card shows a young girl handing a hot water bottle to a
snowman.
   On the inside are the signatures of Blakeman, who first sent the
card, and Mulock, who sent it back a year later.
   On the back are 28 more years of signatures, including the
additional names of husbands and children as they arrived.
   This year, Blakeman sent the card minus the names of two children
who no longer live at home.
   ``Now we'll start taking away the names because the kids are
moving out,'' Mulock said.
   Next Christmas, Blakeman is expecting the card to arrive at her
door for the 16th time.
   ``If we lost it, I'd feel terrible,'' Mulock said. ``Especially
after all these years.''

<HEAD>Reagan's Final Budget Says Balanced Account Is Possible By 1993</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Reagan will leave his successor a
spending blueprint which projects that the federal budget can be
balanced by 1993, nine years later than the target Reagan set when
he campaigned for the presidency in 1980.
   Officials, who are putting the finishing touches on the
administration's final budget, said it will call for a deficit of
$92.5 billion for the 1990 fiscal year, which starts next October.
   That would represent a decline from an actual deficit of $155.1
billion in the 1988 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   The narrowing of the gap between government revenues and spending
was accomplished by optimistic economic assumptions which boost the
government's tax take and a combination of spending cuts, increased
user fees and $6 billion in sales of government assets.
   The administration is projecting that its policies will result in
a balanced budget by 1993 without the need to increase taxes.
   The 1990 budget more than meets the $100 billion deficit
reduction limit established by the Gramm-Rudman law. That
legislation sets declining deficit targets for each year ending with
a balanced budget in 1993.
   Reagan's final spending plan projects meeting those targets each
year, ending with a small surplus in 1993. When Reagan campaigned
for the presidency in 1980, he promised to balance the budget by
1984.
   Joseph Wright, head of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, briefed Reagan, Vice President George Bush and other members
of the Cabinet on the administration's final spending blueprint on
Wednesday.
   Officials said that all decisions have now been made on the
budget, which the administration will submit to Congress on Jan. 9.
   Reagan told reporters that his budget ``will be in keeping with
the Gramm-Rudman program leading toward a balanced budget.''
   Wright told reporters at a briefing that the administration had
succeeded in reaching its deficit goals without touching Social
Security or abandoning the president's goal of boosting defense
spending by 2 percent above the inflation rate each year. Wright
also said that the budget would not include any new taxes.
   While Wright would not reveal the actual deficit figure, an
administration source, who spoke on condition that his name not be
used, said that Reagan's final budget would show a deficit of $92.5
billion.
   This figure includes $6 billion in asset sales, the source said.
These sales do not count toward meeting the Gramm-Rudman target.
However, even with the asset sales discounted, the administration's
budget would still be below the $100 billion target.
   The administration's final budget is calling for spending of
$1.15 trillion in 1990, an increase over projected spending of $1.10
trillion in the current fiscal year.
   Without any changes in current government services, the
administration projected the 1990 deficit would total $127 billion.
However, this projection does not include about $9 billion in
increased spending for defense, space programs, AIDS research and
other areas where Reagan will seek increases rather than reductions
from current projections of growth in government programs.
   Wright said the administration would also ask for increased
spending to rescue failed savings and loan associations, but he
refused to provide any specifics of how much money would be involved.
   However, the administration source said that the Reagan budget
would project spending of $25 billion over the next two years by the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board to close and merge failed S&Ls. The
agency spent $8 billion in the 1988 fiscal year.
   Critics have charged that the actual cost of resolving the S&L
crisis could climb as high as $100 billion and should be one of
Bush's top priorities when he takes office.
   The administration has been accused of using overly optimistic
economic assumptions to reach the deficit reduction goals. The
Congressional Budget Office, using more pessimistic assumptions, is
expected to project a 1990 deficit about $20 billion higher than the
administration when it releases its own report early next year.
   Wright said that Bush and his choice for OMB director, Richard
Darman, have been kept informed of the work on the 1990 budget. Bush
has indicated he intends to provide Congress with at least a
blueprint of his own spending priorities but he has refused to say
he will submit an entirely new document after he takes office.
   It has been previously reported that the administration would
seek to cut $5.2 billion from Medicare, the program that provides
health care for 33 million elderly and disabled Social Security
recipients. The reductions would be achieved by reducing payments to
doctors and hospitals.
   In addition, the administration is seeking savings of $1.1
billion in the Medicaid program which pays the health costs of poor
persons.
   Wright has also said other savings would be achieved through
cutting farm subsidy payments and government pension benefits.

   A helicopter plucked a shivering sailor from
a lifeboat he had clung to for six days after his oceanography
research ship sank in a storm off western Italy, authorities
reported.
   The sailor and the three other people on board the
Posillipo-Loran had been presumed dead after it went down off Naples
in a Dec. 15 storm.
   But helicopters scanning the Tyrrhenian Sea on Wednesday spotted
two inflated rafts, one carrying 29-year-old Francesco Di Liello and
the other containing the body of a researcher from the ship, the
navy said.
   Di Liello was rushed to Cardarelli Hospital in nearby Naples,
where doctors said he was suffering from shock and starvation but
was expected to survive, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   The sailor said the Posillipo-Loran had been battered by high
waves during the storm and had sprung a leak in the hull.

   A mate is being sought for a lonely
wolf that a local official says is in danger of dying of a broken
heart.
   Arnsberg administrator Richard Gruenschlaeger on Wednesday asked
residents to help find a young female mate for a North American
timber wolf recently found caged in the city.
   Authorities took the wolf to a nearby zoo, but he remains
isolated because other wolves would attack a newcomer,
Gruenschlaeger said.
   ``Timber wolves have a very strong need to live within a
community,'' Gruenschlaeger said. ``He is destined to die without
company.''
   Gruenschlaeger said the wolf could not be returned to the wild
because he had spent too long in a cage.
   ``His only hope is to find a pretty young female wolf with whom
he can build his own pack,'' Gruenschlaeger said.

<HEAD>North's Notebooks To Be Subpoenaed By Prosecution; Trial Date Set</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution says it plans to seek a
subpoena for former White House aide Oliver North's notebooks in
which he took copious daily notes while he was a key operative in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   John Keker, head of the prosecution team in the North case,
disclosed the government's intentions Wednesday during a hearing in
which U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell set a Jan. 31 trial date
for North.
   North is charged with conspiring with former national security
adviser John Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to illegally divert more than $12
million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   North through his lawyer invoked his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination last May in refusing to turn over to the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee dozens of his spiral-bound
notebooks.
   As a National Security Council aide, North took extensive notes
on a variety of topics during phone calls and in the course of daily
business with people in and out of the Reagan administration.
   The notebooks, some 2,848 pages in all, first came up in
testimony before Congress in the Iran-Contra hearings last year and
portions of them previously given to congressional investigators
also are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs, drug
traffickers, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA. But
large segments _ committee aides said about half the contents _ have
been blacked out by Brendan Sullivan, one of North's lawyers, or by
White House censors.
   Keker said the prosecution would file a motion in the next few
days for the notebooks in North's possession, which he compiled
while running the program to give covert aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   Last May, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the foreign
relations panel's narcotics subcommittee, complained that Sullivan
was ``custodian of documents that have been walked out of the
workplace of the most highly sensitive government agency that we
have.''
   Gesell's decision to set a trial date was prompted by comments
from one of North's lawyers, Barry Simon, who said several key
witnesses in the case will be leaving the Reagan administration next
month ``for the four corners of the Earth.''
   Keker, head of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's trial team,
said ``we certainly hope we can meet that date.''
   Some uncertainty remains, however, whether North's trial actually
will take place as scheduled.
   U.S. intelligence specialists are trying to decide whether they
can permit disclosure of national security secrets contained in
classified documents that prosecutors want to introduce as evidence.
   National security concerns have placed in jeopardy North's trial
on the major conspiracy and theft charges, which involve extensive
use of classified material. Other charges against him, such as lying
to Congress and illegal use of a tax-exempt foundation, involve such
material to a much smaller extent.
   Gesell ruled Dec. 12 that too much material relevant to the case
had been excised from the 300 classified documents that Walsh's
prosecution team wants to use as evidence at trial.
   Gesell said that while the documents had all been properly
classified, too much had been held back, especially if a jury was to
understand the facts of the case.

<HEAD>Industry Disputes Report Saying Consumers Have Been Short-Changed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Consumer Federation of America report
concluding residential telephone subscribers have been short-changed
since the Bell System breakup was branded inaccurate and misleading
by the phone industry and its regulators.
   The regional Bell phone companies and the Federal Communications
Commission rejected the report's findings that phone rates have
ballooned since the AT&T divestiture while the spin-off companies
earn excessive profits.
   ``Service has never been better. The percentage of homes with a
phone has never been higher,'' said BellSouth, one of seven regional
Bell companies spun off from American Telephone & Telegraph Co. in
the breakup five years ago.
   The federation's annual report on phone service, released
Wednesday, said telephone service is no longer the consumer bargain
it once was.
   Overall phone rates, which rose at less than one-third the rate
of general inflation in the 50 years before divestiture, have been
rising as fast as inflation since then, the report says.
   Local rates followed the same pre-divestiture trend as overall
rates, but after the breakup, local rates have climbed twice as fast
as inflation, the study said. Much of the increase resulted from a
charge imposed by federal regulators that now costs each residential
subscriber $3.20 per month. It was intended to reduce long-distance
subsidies of the local phone network.
   Inflation-adjusted local rates are up 25 to 35 percent, while
long-distance rates have dropped 43 percent, the report said.
However, most Americans make too few interstate calls to offset the
higher local rates, according to the federation.
   ``Segments of the telephone industry used the Bell breakup as a
Trojan horse to conceal their assault on one of the best consumer
bargains of modern times,'' said Gene Kimmelman, author of the
report from the Washington-based federation, which claims to be the
nation's largest consumer advocacy group.
   ``Had we preserved traditional regulation, consumers would be
paying about $4 per month less for local service, and ratepayers
would be saving $1 (billion) to $2 billion dollars each year,'' he
said.
   BellSouth said the report ``lumps out-of-date statistics in an
attempt to plant inaccuracies in the minds of customers'' and
charged Kimmelman with ``juggling the figures.''
   Gerald Brock, the FCC's top telephone official, said the report
was ``intentionally misleading ... it is an attempt to put together
figures that have no relevance to each other to show a trend that
doesn't exist.''
   He said a ``substantial portion'' of the local rate increases
granted by the states to Bell companies after they were spun off
from AT&T resulted from the companies writing off old equipment and
facilities. He said that caused an increase in prices, ``but that
was going to happen at some time.''
   ``We are now seeing real telephone rates decline,'' he said,
citing government figures showing the Consumer Price Index for local
and long-distance phone service declined 1.3 percent in 1987 and
dropped 0.1 percent this year.
   Bell Atlantic said none of its local phone companies has had a
general rate increase since October 1985 and ``rates for many
services have been reduced.''
   ``Prices have stabilized and the trend is down,'' said Dan
Behuniak, a Bell Atlantic assistant vice president.
   The divestiture separated AT&T's long-distance operations from
its monopoly local Bell units. The local companies were formed into
seven regional holding companies that operate extensive local phone
networks.
   Since the breakup, the report said, these Bell companies have
earned higher profits that are ``far out of line with historical
Bell system earnings and the current marketplace.''

   The government is getting off to a good start
toward reducing the budget deficit in 1989, but analysts say rising
interest rates and a slowing economy will make the task increasingly
difficult.
   The Treasury Department said Wednesday that a budget gap of $56.5
billion for the first two months of the fiscal year, which began
Oct. 1, was 2.4 percent lower than for the same period in the
previous year.
   The federal government ran up a $29.0 billion budget deficit in
November and $27.4 billion in October. The November red ink was 7.4
percent higher than a year earlier, but the October figure was 10.9
percent below the year-earlier total.
   The October deficit was held down by two special factors, a
decline in farm subsidy payments and a drop in military spending
caused by a shift in paycheck dates.
   The Reagan administration is projecting the budget deficit in
fiscal 1989 will shrink to $145.5 billion from $155.1 billion in the
1988 fiscal year ended Sept. 30. The Congressional Budget Office
forecasts a $148 billion shortfall.
   ``This year, we're going to have a bigger deficit because the
economy isn't going to grow as fast as it did in 1988 and interest
rates will be higher,'' said Michael K. Evans, an economic
consultant in Washington. ``We had a break (in October) but now
we're just about even.''
   Weak growth hurts deficit-cutting efforts by slowing tax
collections. Higher interest rates force the government to spend
more to finance the $2.7 trillion national debt.
   The need to spend billions of dollars to clean up government
nuclear power plants and to rescue the ailing savings and loan
industry also could add to President-elect Bush's budget problems.
   ``On the face of it, it looks like we're beginning to put in a
good performance for 1989 ... but everyone is fairly skeptical about
whether we will be able to maintain that pace. There are a lot of
expenditures in the pipeline,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, an economist
with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Government revenue in November totaled $64.4 billion, or $7.4
billion higher than a year earlier. But spending rose an even
heftier $9.4 billion to $93.4 billion.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in November were the
military, Social Security, other programs in the Department of
Health and Human Services, interest on the national debt and farm
subsidies.
   Military spending totaled $23.9 billion last month and $49.1
billion for the fiscal year so far, up 6.9 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   Spending for Social Security totaled $18.4 billion last month and
$35.8 billion for the past two months, up 6.3 percent from the same
period in the 1988 fiscal year.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $18.1 billion last month
and $33.3 billion so far this fiscal year, an increase of 8.3
percent over the same period last year.
   The other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent
$13.6 billion in November and $25.3 billion so far this budget year,
a 0.6 percent decline.
   Spending by the Agriculture Department totaled $5.3 billion in
November and $11.1 billion since Oct. 1, down 13.6 percent from
fiscal 1988.
   Evans said the drought assistance to farmers likely will boost
farm spending in coming months.
   ``Even though the numbers haven't shown up in the budget, they
have to. Congress passed the drought relief bill. It's just a matter
of timing as to when the Treasury sends out the checks. That'll be
about $5 billion,'' he said.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits in
commercial banks, spent $1.71 billion more than it collected in
revenue in November. It spent $840 million last month as part of the
$2 billion rescue of First Republic Bank of Dallas.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which backs
deposits in savings institutions, spent $1.07 billion more than it
collected so far this fiscal year, approximately double from last
year.

   It will be monkey bread as usual for the
Reagans on Christmas Day, but for the first time in eight years they
won't be eating it in the White House.
   For the last yuletide of the Reagan administration, the president
and first lady are going to exchange their gifts in California
instead of upstairs over the State Dining Room.
   It's nothing new for presidents to go away for Christmas. Jimmy
Carter and his family went home to Plains, Ga. The Gerald Fords went
to a ski chalet in Vail, Colo.
   The Reagans, however, have chosen ever since 1981 to celebrate
the holiday in the residential quarters of the executive mansion.
   This year, they will have Christmas dinner at the house in the
Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles where they will be living after
the president's term ends on Jan. 20.
   The menu: roast turkey with cornbread dressing, cranberry sauce,
mashed potatoes, peas with pearl onions, fruit salad, monkey bread
and plum pudding with whipped cream.
   Monkey bread, a holiday favorite of the Reagans, is a bread that
you tear apart as you eat it.
   First, however, they are having a pre-Christmas dinner Thursday
evening in the White House, with Washington friends and some of Mrs.
Reagan's relatives.
   The menu for this one will be less traditional: roast turkey with
dried hominy corn dressing, cranberry sauce, a Christmas tree made
out of kale surrounded by vegetables, white turnips carved like
bells and filled with celery root puree, pumpkin bread shaped like
gingerbread men and women, salad, ice cream filled with crunchy cake
and rolled in coconut, and Christmas cookies.
   Friday morning, the president and first lady fly to California,
where they will visit friends in Los Angeles as well as explore
their new home. As they have for years, they will spend New Year's
eve at a party at the home of publisher Walter Annenberg in Rancho
Mirage, Calif.
   They return to Washington Jan. 5 and are expected to make their
last flight on Air Force One on Inauguration Day. Following custom,
the presidential plane will be used to return the outgoing president
to his home after President-elect Bush is sworn in.
   Mrs. Reagan said she and her husband are giving each other things
for the house as Christmas presents. Their children and
grandchildren will be on hand for the Los Angeles celebration, with
the exception of daughter Patti, who is estranged from her parents.

<HEAD>Broadcasters Vow To Challenge Federal Ruling On Indecent Material</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Broadcasters and free-speech advocates say they
will appeal a new Federal Communications Commission rule banning
sexually explicit programming from the airwaves.
   The agency issued the rule Wednesday in response to a new law
that closes the FCC's current midnight-to-6 a.m. window during which
indecent material may be aired.
   ``Our view is that the statute is plainly unconstitutional,''
said Washington, D.C., attorney Timothy Dyk, who is representing a
coalition of broadcasters and free-speech groups.
   One FCC commissioner, Patricia Diaz Dennis, also said she has
constitutional questions about the rule because recent court
decisions have upheld First Amendment protection of indecent
broadcast programming.
   The Democratic commissioner said the FCC had no alternative but
to order the around-the-clock ban in compliance with the measure
passed earlier this year by Congress. But she said she has ``grave
misgivings about the constitutionality'' of the rule.
   The recent court decisions, she said, ``suggest that the courts
would not uphold an outright ban on the broadcast of indecent
speech.''
   The new rule is to take effect 30 days after it is published in
the Federal Register. It applies only to over-the-air radio and TV
broadcasts and does not apply to cable TV.
   In its order, the FCC noted that it previously had interpreted
existing law to prohibit obscene programming at any time and
indecent programming only when there was a reasonable risk that
children might be in the audience. It said the courts also held that
opinion.
   But, the agency said, ``the directive (of Congress) affords us no
discretion ... and we will now enforce the indecency restrictions 24
hours a day.''
   Diane Killory, FCC general counsel, said that although the FCC
previously argued before the courts that indecency could not be
removed entirely from the air, ``a defense (of an outright ban) can
be put forward.''
   She said the FCC previously interpreted court rulings as
permitting the agency to ``channel'' indecent programming to avoid
children. Congress, she said, feels that such material should be
``channeled right off the medium.''
   Indecent material is defined by the FCC as that which ``in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.''
   Obscene material, which is already banned from the airwaves, is
defined as that which appeals to the prurient interest and lacks
serious, artistic, literary, political or scientific value.
   Dyk said an outright ban on indecency would ``deny this material
to adults who would like to receive it. ... We're talking about a
lot of material that has important social value.''

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scholars have determined a book bound in wood
and leather and buried under a child's head more than 1,600 years
ago is the earliest complete book of Psalms and probably the oldest
book of any kind.
   ``We have for the first time a complete book of Psalms dating
from the second half of the 4th century A.D., making it the oldest
complete book of Psalms ever found,'' museum director Gawdat Gabra
said Wednesday.
   ``Never before have we seen such an early book in Egypt, and I
can find no evidence of an earlier true book anywhere. This volume
is a book in every sense of the word,'' he said.
   Gabra, director of Cairo's Coptic Museum, first saw the book
within days of its discovery four years ago and has studied it for
the past 2{ years. He is an Egyptologist as well as one of the
world's top experts in Coptic studies.
   The book includes about 490 parchment pages, bound between wooden
covers stitched with leather. The Psalms are handwritten in a
dialect of Coptic, a now-dead language of Old Greek characters
supplemented by seven hieroglyphs from ancient Egypt's late period.
   Gabra said the text contains many Greek and some Coptic words
never seen before. It is written in brown ink derived from iron
except in a few passages, where words were written over in black
carbon ink in apparent attempts to repair damage. Wear is obvious
where fingertips turned the parchment pages.
   The book's pages were stuck together when it was found in 1984.
All but the last five, two of which are blank, have been separated.
   A tiny key of life carved from bone was attached to the book by
leather threads. The key, or ankh, is a symbol from ancient Egypt
that was incorporated in the Christian cross.
   ``It is the earliest complete book of Psalms, at the same time
written in a new dialect for scholars, and we have its whole
history,'' said Martin Krause, Coptic studies professor of Munster
University in West Germany.
   ``I must stress that this manuscript is important not only for
Coptic study but for all Biblical traditions,'' said Krause, who has
studied the text for four months.
   The book was discovered by Egyptian antiquities inspectors in a
cemetery for the poor about 85 miles south of Cairo and 25 miles
north of a Greco-Roman city called Oxyrhynchus.
   ``Nothing indicated much of historical interest in the
cemetery,'' Gabra said. ``Some bodies were buried with textiles, but
there was little else to be found.
   ``Then workers found the grave of a little girl, about 12 years
old, and under her head was this book with the tiny key of life.''
   He said it is not known why the child was buried there, because
the value of the book indicates her family must have been rich.
``They must have loved her very much. Perhaps she was an only
child,'' Gabra said. ``To put something of such an immense value
indicates how they felt about her. This book would have taken a long
time to copy and would have cost a lot.''
   Gabra said the book has immense historical value, epecially
because it was found in a grave and did not arrive via antiquities
smugglers. He said everything about the book can be documented.
   ``Until now what we had were fragments of Psalms, such as found
in the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' and later versions of the Old Testament
book, some of questionable origin, Gabra said. Most original texts
have disappeared.
   ``The Coptic Church traces its Book of Psalms to two Greek
versions, one of which is incomplete,'' Gabra said. ``The new book
will add much to what has been missing, because it's the version
nearer the missing manuscript.''
   The Coptic Church is among the world's oldest Christian faiths,
traditionally dating from St. Mark's arrival in Egypt between A.D.
48-75. There are 5 million to 6 million Coptic Christians, about 10
percent of Egypt's population.
   Only two other manuscripts have been found written in the same
Oxyrhynchus dialect. One, the Gospel of St. Matthew, is in the
private collection of William Scheide, of Princeton, N.J. The other,
called the Glazier Codex, contains the first 15 chapters of Acts of
the Apostles and is in New York City's Pierpont Morgan Library.
   Gabra said Psalms was the biblical book most often buried with
early Egyptian Copts. The book-burying tradition evolved from
ancient Egypt, when the ``Book of the Dead'' surrounded mummies on
tomb walls to help the deceased enter the afterworld, he said.
   ``Psalms was the favorite work throughout early Christianity in
Egypt. No other book was so quoted,'' Gabra said. ``Monks had to
memorize the book, and even until modern times Psalms was used for
magical purposes.''
   Museum director Gabra said the first scholastic publication about
the book's archaeology, conservation and historical importance is
expected next year. Years of study lie ahead.
   Eventually, he said, ``we plan to display the book in a special
room of its own in the Coptic Museum, giving it the importance it
deserves.''

<HEAD>Scientists Predict Computer-Run Wars, Laser Shields For Homes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Future wars may be fought on supercomputers,
homes may be protected by laser shields, and AIDS could have the
impact of a world war by the end of the century.
   These are among predictions _ both dire and encouraging _ made by
scientists and forecasters writing for ``The Futurist,'' the
magazine of the World Future Society.
   Each year the non-profit scientific and educational association
publishes a compilation of some 70 forecasts of the future in such
fields as world population, the environment, international business,
education, health, technology and the work force.
   Among the predictions for 1989 and beyond:
   _By the end of the century, AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, could have the impact of a world war, with total deaths
worldwide amounting to 50 million in the 1990s _ more than the Black
Death plague of the 14th century. Also, the incurable disease is
unlikely to spread rapidly in America's heterosexual population.
   _Most heart bypass operations will be eliminated by the year 2000
in favor of less intrusive procedures or clot-dissolving drugs.
   _The United States will have a shortage of 1.2 million nurses by
the year 2000.
   _Robots will replace only a tiny fraction of the estimated 131
million people in the U.S. labor force by 1997. For every working
robot, there will still be more than 400 people working.
   _Computers will become an increasingly popular target for
terrorists. Attacks on high-tech targets such as computer networks,
telecommunications facilities or defense computers could pose a
major threat to industrialized nations.
   _Automobiles will be guided by remote control on ``electronic
highways.'' Traffic lights and gates tied to a central computer will
control access and movement. Drivers will receive information on
traffic flow and parking availability on digital display screens in
each car.
   _Future wars may be fought on supercomputers. A military leader
may capitulate after receiving an unfavorable computer readout from
his forecast staff rather than undertake a bloody battle.
   _Adults may soon constitute a majority of the U.S. college
student population. People over 25 accounted for 30 percent of
student enrollment in 1972; half the college population will likely
consist of adults by 1992.
   _Many homes will be protected by relatively inexpensive laser
shields and artificial-intelligence home security systems within 20
years. Surveillance by satellite and light-sensitive monitors may
soon be feasible.
   _More species will disappear during this century than have
disappeared at any period since the age of the dinosaurs. As the
extinction rate of animals increases, zoos may increasingly become
``Noah's Archives'' _ preservers of the world's species.
   _Worldwide sea levels will rise over the next century at a faster
rate than ever before, due to the warming of the earth's atmosphere
caused by the greenhouse effect. Permanent coastal structures such
as airports with runways built on reclaimed land will face
increasing threats of flooding.
   The greenhouse effect may benefit agriculture, however. Wheat,
rice and corn _ the planet's three major foods _ increase in
productivity in environments enriched by carbon dioxide.
Unfortunately, so do weeds.
   _The global energy crisis of the 1970s may return in the 1990s.
Worldwide dependence on Middle Eastern and OPEC oil is increasing
and may exceed 1973 levels by the turn of the century. Geothermal
energy could meet U.S. energy needs at current consumption levels
for the next 600 years.
   _Economic trade rivalry between the United States and Japan could
lead to trade wars. Japanese control of the most advanced
semi-conductor technology by the early 1990s may further erode U.S.
economic strength, leading to a reduction of U.S. military
deployment and security commitments in the Pacific and elsewhere.

<HEAD>Maryland Plant Is Added To List Of Worst US Nuclear Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An atomic reactor in New York and a
twin-reactor plant in southern Maryland where a worker recently
drowned have been added to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's list
of the nation's worst nuclear power stations.
   The Calvert Cliffs plant, near Lusby, Md., about 50 miles
southeast of Washington, has recently had a number of accidents,
including one in which a worker drowned in a condensate tank that
was blanketed with nitrogen gas.
   Also added Wednesday to the NRC's ``watch list'' of problem
plants was the Nine Mile Point No. 2 reactor on the shores of Lake
Ontario near Scriba, N.Y.
   At the same time, the commission removed from its list of problem
reactors the Rancho Seco plant near Sacramento, Calif., as well as
Commonwealth Edison's Dresden units No. 2 and 3 near Morris, Ill.
   Rancho Seco, operated by the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District, narrowly avoided being shut down in a ballot question in
November. Instead, voters decided to give the plant another 18
months to prove that it can be operated efficiently.
   Altogether, the NRC's semi-annual rating had 16 reactors at nine
different locations on the watch list, meaning they warrant
particularly close attention.
   Assessing overall performance of the nation's 110 operating
nuclear power reactors, Thomas E. Murley, director of the NRC's
office of nuclear reactor regulation, told the commissioners at a
briefing Wednesday ``there are firm indications that show that
average operating performance is improving.''
   But he added that ``we have a long way to go,'' noting there were
problems with complacency about safety at some plants.
   The Calvert Cliffs plant includes two 825-megawatt pressurized
water reactors that went into commercial service in the mid-1970s.
   William Russell, administrator of the NRC's King of Prussia, Pa.,
regional office, said the Maryland plant had been put on the problem
list due to ``fairly significant operational errors and failures to
follow procedures.''
   He cited three incidents at Calvert Cliffs:
   _On June 6, during a test of emergency diesel generators, ``the
operators failed to follow procedures and put the voltage regulators
from the automatic mode to manual mode ... and failed to restore
them to automatic following the test.'' This meant the emergency
generators were inoperative for 48 hours until the problem was
discovered.
   _On July 4, while starting up one of the reactors, operators
failed to respond properly when they got two different readings for
the reactor's power because instruments were not recalibrated for a
new fuel cycle. ``This was particularly disturbing in that they had
extra people available ... and there were a number of opportunities
for people to question what was being done,'' Russell said.
   _On Sept. 15, a worker drowned in a condensate tank used to store
fresh water for use in the plant's steam system. This happened after
one worker entering the tank passed out due to nitrogen gas
blanketing the top of the tank. Another worker then entered the tank
to help the first one, fell into the water and drowned.
   In a statement, Edward A. Crooke, president of Baltimore Gas and
Electric Co., owner of Calvert Cliffs, said the utility was
dedicated to taking all necessary steps to address the NRC's
concerns.
   ``Our goal in all of this is to promptly return Calvert Cliffs to
a position of excellence in the commercial nuclear industry. We will
be satisfied with nothing less,'' Crooke said.
   Regarding Nine Mile Point No. 2, owned by Niagara Mohawk Power
Co., Russell told the commission the reactor was added to the list
because ``we concluded that they were not able to effectively
operate the station.''
   He pointed to ``a very high rate of scrams (sudden shutdowns) and
operating events'' and said the utility needed to develop a
``comprehensive plan'' to deal with deficiencies at the plant.
   The plant's unit No. 1 was already on the NRC's problem list.
   Stephen Brady, a spokesman for Niagara Mohawk, said William J.
Donlon, the utility's chairman, had sent a telegram to the NRC
saying the company has taken steps to strengthen its nuclear
management team and is ``driving hard to improve operations at Nine
Mile Point Units 1 and 2 to make those plants the standard of the
industry.''
   Other plants on the NRC's problem list are Sequoyah 1 and 2,
owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority; Browns Ferry 1, 2 and 3,
also TVA; Turkey Point 3 and 4, Florida Power & Light Co.; Fermi 2,
Detroit Edison Co.; Fort Calhoun, Omaha, Public Power District;
Pilgrim, Boston Edison Co.; and Peach Bottom 2 and 3, Philadelphia
Electric Co.

   At the height of its power, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. bestrode the financial world like a colossus, using its
money-raising power to finance everything from nursery school chains
to corporate takeovers.
   ``Drexel is like a god in that end of the business and a god can
to anything it wants. ... They are awesome. You hate to do business
against them,'' said one awed competitor, Michael Boylan, the
president of Macfadden Holdings, in 1986.
   On Wednesday, the colossus dropped to its knees, legally if not
financially. Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six federal felony
counts and pay a record $650 million fine to settle the biggest Wall
Street securities fraud case in history.
   The deal requires approval of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and senior Justice Department officials.
   Drexel's power came from its exploitation of an area of finance
that other investment bankers had ignored, either because of lack of
imagination or lack of appetite for risk.
   Drexel helped clients raise large amounts of money quickly by
issuing bonds that were riskier than investment-grade securities and
hence paid higher yields.
   The securities quickly became known as junk bonds, to the dismay
of Drexel and Michael Milken, the brilliant strategist who helped
pioneer them and was also a target of the criminal probe.
   In spite of its upstart image, Drexel was not a newcomer to Wall
Street. It traces its roots to the founding of Burnham & Co. in
1935. Drexel Firestone, which Burnham acquired in 1973, goes back to
the 1830s and once counted J.P. Morgan among its partners.
   Drexel was a second-tier investment bank, though, until the
mid-1970s, when it came up with the concept of selling junk bonds as
original issues.
   Until then, the only junk bonds were securities that had
originally been issued with a higher rating but whose issuers had
fallen on hard times.
   Drexel worked both sides of the deal, lining up investors who
were attracted by the bonds' attractive yields and grateful issuers
who had never before been able to raise money in the bond market.
   Frederick H. Joseph, now Drexel's chief executive, was then head
of corporate finance, leading underwriting efforts.
   Milken led Drexel's junk-bond trading operation and moved it to
Beverly Hills, Calif., from New York in 1977.
   The company's biggest break came in the early 1980s, when it hit
on the idea of using junk bonds to finance corporate takeovers. That
idea vaulted it to the front ranks of investment banks and
revolutionized the mergers and acquisitions business.
   Corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn, Sir James Goldsmith, Saul
Steinberg and T. Boone Pickens Jr. established close relations with
Drexel, as did stock speculators such as Ivan Boesky.
   Among the companies taken over with the help of junk bonds
floated by Drexel were TWA Inc. and Crown Zellerbach Corp. Drexel is
also playing a major role in financing Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co.'s $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Drexel earned enormous fees for underwriting and trading junk
bonds and for its takeover advice, boosting its capital more than
tenfold from 1981 to $2.2 billion last year. That made the privately
held company the fifth largest firm on Wall Street.
   But Drexel's influence in the takeover game began to diminish
somewhat amid the insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, which
erupted with the arrest of a Drexel investment banker, Dennis R.
Levine, and then led to a government investigation of Drexel's
tactics.
   Still, Drexel has denied suggestions that the probe severely
impaired the firm, claiming its junk bond business and its other
investment banking operations remained strong.
   As recently as Wednesday, before Drexel's agreement to plead
guilty, Southland Corp., the parent company of 7-Eleven convenience
stores, announced it had switched its investment banking business to
Drexel, dumping the prestigious investment banking firms of Goldman,
Sachs & Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc.

<HEAD>Company Says Product Would Enable Corn To Grow Its Own Pesticide</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Field trials have ``proved the safety of the
technology'' for a new product that would enable corn to grow its
own pesticide, the manufacturer says.
   The bioinsecticide, or Cxc-Bt, was developed by Crop Genetics
International Corp. of Hanover, Md., and is aimed at controlling the
European corn borer, a pest estimated to cost $400 million in losses
annually to the nation's corn crop.
   A series of tests was performed in Maryland this year and Crop
Genetics said it will seek further approval from the Agriculture
Department and the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out
additional field trials in 1989 at various locations, including
major corn areas of the Midwest.
   ``The scientific data from our field trials in Maryland confirms
the environmental safety of our bioinsecticide,'' Peter S. Carlson,
chief scientist and co-founder of the company, said Wednesday.
   Some environmentalists had feared the bioinsecticide might spread
to other plants or to humans and other animal species.
   But Crop Genetics said the Maryland tests showed that Cxc-Bt does
not multiply or survive outside its host plant. The Cxc part of the
``vaccine'' was described as a naturally occurring microorganism
which can live only inside a plant's vascular system.
   The Bt part ``is lethal to the borer but harmless to humans,
animals, birds and non-target insects,'' the company said. The
product, which the firm calls InCide, is inserted in corn seed,
enabling corn plants to grow their own biopesticide against the
borer.
   Company officials said the 1989 field tests will include yield
and production information to see how well the biopesticide performs.

   A federal audit shows the Farmers Home
Administration is losing money at a record pace, but a spokesman
says the Agriculture Department agency is in business to help
people, not make a profit.
   The audit by the General Accounting Office says the agency has
built a 40-year deficit of at least $36 billion, of which about $22
billion occurred last year.
   ``Farmers Home was created by the Congress to do specific
things,'' spokesman Marlyn Aycock said Wednesday. ``I don't think it
was created to make a profit, or else they wouldn't have said we
have to lend to people who can't get money elsewhere.''
   The GAO, an investigating agency of Congress, said that since
FmHA's revolving credit accounts began in 1946, cumulative losses
have amounted to about $59 billion, of which Congress reimbursed the
Agriculture Department agency $23 billion.
   ``Our opinion on FmHA's statement of financial position reflects
our concerns over the agency's inability to repay its borrowings and
to meet its current operations without incurring additional debt and
the magnitude of its accumulated $36 billion deficit, which includes
$22 billion for losses recognized in fiscal year 1987,'' said
Frederick D. Wolf, director of GAO's accounting and financial
management division.
   The agency has its roots in the mid-1930s during the Depression
and is often called the government's lender of last resort for
hard-pressed farmers who cannot get credit from banks and other
commercial lenders.
   Although farm loans are a key element of FmHA operations, rural
housing and rural development also are involved.
   The GAO audit was for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 1987,
and was the first in the agency's history. It was submitted on
Tuesday to Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, who is required by
law to respond to Congress within 60 days.
   Aycock said in an interview that as of Sept. 30, 1988, the agency
had total loans outstanding of about $62 billion. Less than half _
$25.5 billion _ was owed under the farm lending programs. The
balance was loans for rural housing and community development.
   Of the total $62 billion in loans, about $9.2 billion were
delinquent. The farm delinquencies represented $8.3 billion of that
amount, Aycock said.
   ``Every loan we make is subsidized to one extent or another,'' he
said. ``Over half of $62 billion loans we've got are made at
interest rates below 5 percent.''
   As to GAO's finding that the agency lost $22 billion last year,
Aycock said much of that was bookkeeping that the GAO itself had
insisted upon.

   The Soviet Union has canceled a further 102,500
metric tons of U.S. soybean meal that had been scheduled for
delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between the two
countries, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   On Tuesday, USDA announced the cancellation of 200,000 tons that
had been bought for 1988-89 delivery to the Soviet Union.
   No explanation was given, but officials say that conflicts in
shipping schedules or price disagreements have been behind such
cancellations in the past.
   The United States and the Soviet Union on Nov. 28 signed an
extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had
expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run
through Dec. 31, 1990.
   With the cancellations, the Soviets still have on order 532,500
tons of soybean meal and 500,000 tons of soybeans.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council reversed two previous votes
Wednesday and approved an ordinance protecting the rights of
homosexuals.
   ``This grants everyone in the city a right of a house, a job and
city services,'' said Mayor Eugene Sawyer. ``There's nothing
outlandish about that.''
   Sawyer, who personally lobbied for the ordinance, met with
reporters along with leaders of the homosexual and lesbian
communities after the council action.
   In addition to homosexuals, the ordinance protects the elderly
and the handicapped from discrimination in housing, employment and
other areas.
   The measure was approved 28 to 17, with some aldermen saying they
had changed their minds since the ordinance was last defeated, while
others said they hadn't changed their minds but switched their vote
to reflect their constituents' views.
   Alderman Bernard Stone said his North Side ward supports the
human rights ordinance, but he said he still believes homosexuality
``is an abomination.''
   With a special mayoral primary election coming up in February,
some aldermen were under pressure to abandon previous opposition so
the mayoral candidates they support would not lose the votes of
homosexuals.
   Sawyer himself had voted against the ordinance when he was an
alderman in 1986, but like all the major mayoral candidates now
supports the ordinance.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Bill Cosby and producers
of his top-rated ``The Cosby Show'' are being sued by a
father-and-son scriptwriting team who accuse them of plagiarism.
   In their federal lawsuit filed here, Henry and Daniel Shea of
Berkley contend that a script they submitted to the TV show in June
1986 was rejected, but then used in fragments over seven shows
broadcast between September 1986 and November 1987.
   ``We have a line-by-line comparison of the submitted script and
the dialogue from the finished shows,'' said Joseph Moch, the Sheas'
attorney. ``The overlapping areas are too similar, and occur too
frequently, to be coincidence.
   The suit asks for unspecified damages of at least $25,000.
   ``The reaction we have gotten so far is, in essence, `That's how
this business goes.' Well, that's not how the business goes around
here,'' he said.
   Representatives for the show in New York declined to comment
Wednesday.
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in July, but because
of the time it took to find all the defendants and serve papers, it
was refiled last week, Moch said.
   In addition to Cosby, the lawsuit names members of the NBC show's
production team, including executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom
Werner and Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist who
oversees the show's content.

   A homeless activist charged with trespassing may
not use a ``choice of evils'' argument to defend her illegal
occupation of a vacant federal house last August, a judge ruled
Wednesday.
   Denver County Judge Raymond Satter denied Dorothy King's motion
to use the defense, saying he was unconvinced it was applicable to
her case.
   Had the defense been allowed, a jury could have acquitted King of
the trespassing charge if it found she committed the crime to
prevent a greater evil _ in this case, the lack of shelter for the
homeless.
   After Satter denied the motion, jury selection began. Opening
arguments were expected to begin Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for
Satter's court said.
   King, 36, faces the misdemeanor trespassing charge for taking a
group of women and children from the shelter she operated to a
vacant house owned by the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development on Aug. 15.
   King was arrested after refusing to leave the house. The next
day, HUD Regional Director Grady Maples made 55 vacant HUD-owned
houses available to community groups as leased housing for the
homeless.
   The action was justified because she was trying to find housing
for the destitute and call attention to the plight of the more than
2,000 homeless people in Denver, her attorneys, Diana DeGette and
Chuck Owens, argued on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Suspected Mafia Member Slain Over Lunch; 11 Mafiosos Sentenced To
Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GELA, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspected Mafioso, his wife and two of
their children were slain by a gunman as they ate their lunchtime
soup, police reported.
   The family members were among eight people slain Wednesday in
four separate attacks apparently linked to organized crime gangs in
Italy.
   In the tip of the ``toe'' of Italy, a man on trial as a suspected
member of the 'ndrangheta, Calabria's version of the Sicilian Mafia,
was shot to death as he began his day as a garbage collector near
Reggio di Calabria.
   In Milan, police said a man linked to crime mob activity in the
northern metropolis was fatally shot at his fruit stand.
   Later Wednesday, two people were killed by gunmen who drove up to
their car at a red light in a town near Naples.
   Police in Sicily said the Gela attack took place in the home of
the family of Salvatore Polara, a suspected Mafia figure. Polara's
third son was wounded in the shooting.
   During the past year, there have been 40 murders in Gela linked
to mob activities such as drug-dealing and extortion.
   Citizens in the city of 80,000 recently held demonstrations
against the Mafia presence, and Italy's top anti-Mafia fighter,
magistrate Domenico Sica, visited after local officials reported the
situation was grave.
   In the town of Casalnuovo near Naples, gunmen in two autos opened
fire on a car at a red light on Wednsday, killing 28-year-old Angelo
d'Alife and 24-year-old Angelo Fico, ANSA reported. Two other men in
the car were wounded.
   The two cars used by the gunmen were later found burned.
   The attack appeared to be the work of the Neopolitan version of
the Mafia, the Camorra, ANSA said.
   Meanwhile in Turin, a court convicted 15 people of killing,
robbing and drug trafficking Wednesday in connection with an
organized crime war for control of the drug market in northern
Italy, ANSA reported.
   Eleven received life sentences and four were sentenced to less
than six years of jail.
   During the trial, a defendant had tossed a homemade bomb into the
courtroom. It caused minor damage and no injuries.
   And in Messina, Sicily, four people, including a man who
allegedly led the Sicilian Mafia, were acquitted Wednesday of the
car-bomb killing of a top judge and three other people, news
agencies reported.
   It was the sixth trial of Michele ``the Pope'' Greco, his brother
Salvatore and two other men for the July 1983 slaying.
   The car bomb killed Judge Rocco Chinnici, who had directed
investigations into the Mafia's multimillion-dollar heroin
trafficking between Sicily and the United States. Also slain were
two of Chinnici's bodyguards and a doorman.
   The judges of the Messina Court of Appeals said there was
insufficient evidence to convict the Greco brothers of planning the
attack.
   However, the court convicted all four of ``association of a Mafia
kind'' and sentenced Michele Greco to 12 years and Salvatore to 10
years in jail.
   Michele Greco is already serving a life term for ordering the
assassination of Gen. Alberto Dalla Chiesa, leader of the nation's
fight against the Mafia. He is nicknamed ``the Pope'' for the
position he allegedly held several years ago at the top of the
pyramid-like Mafia hierarchy.
   Salvatore Greco is a fugitive.

<HEAD>Regulators Clear Way For Seabrook Test License, OK Restart Of
Pilgrim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is going
to court to try to block the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power
plant and promises more legal fights if federal regulators issue a
low-power license for the Seabrook plant in neighboring New
Hampshire.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in unanimous votes Wednesday,
cleared the way for the $5.7 billion Seabrook reactor to receive a
long-sought low-power testing permit _ perhaps within several weeks
_ and ruled that the Pilgrim plant in Plymouth, Mass., can slowly
begin operations after a shutdown of nearly three years.
   In a related development, NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said the
commission will not rule until next year on whether the state and
local governments in New York have legal standing in the licensing
procedure for the idled Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, under
fire for reasons similar to those cited by critics of Seabrook.
   Dukakis, who says it is impossible to evacuate the seacoast towns
around Seabrook and argues that Pilgrim should not be restarted
without an approved evacuation plan, called the commission votes
``irrational'' and ``irresponsible.''
   The state's lawsuit, filed in U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals just
hours after the vote, calls the NRC action on Pilgrim ``arbitrary
and capricious'' and urges an immediate injunction to halt the plant
from getting up to 25 percent power.
   Zech said Seabrook could get its low-power license, which permits
testing at 5 percent power, as early as Jan. 6 if it can set aside
$72.1 million. The NRC said the owners must have that money on hand
for decommissioning costs in case Seabrook receives the testing
permit but never gets a full-power commercial license.
   Seabrook also cannot receive the license, which it has sought for
more than two years, until the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
rules on a request by Massachusetts officials to review alleged
problems with the operators' response during a June exercise of the
plant's emergency plans.
   But Seabrook officials said the commission's staff already has
recommended that the licensing board reject the state's request and
that they expected the issue to be resolved shortly.
   Ted G. Feigenbaum, vice president at New Hampshire Yankee,
operator of Seabrook, predicted low-power testing would be under way
next month.
   The NRC also rejected an appeal by opponents to review the
financial qualifications of Seabrook's owners. The plant's lead
owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in January. In June, the project's fourth largest
shareholder, the Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Co.,
withdrew from the project and halted its $2 million monthly payments.
   In Boston, Dukakis said that ``In the case of Seabrook, it is
unconscionable that the NRC continues to discuss ways to advance
low-power testing, because it is impossible to adequately evacuate
the area.''
   In New Hampshire, Gov.-elect Judd Gregg urged Seabrook officials
to hold off on nuclear tests until they are certain the reactor will
be allowed to operate commercially.
   The vote to restart the Pilgrim plant, which was shut down in
April 1986 because of several management and safety problems, also
was unanimous.
   Zech said the commission was convinced that an estimated $35
million in safety improvements and a sweeping management overhaul by
Boston Edison Co. has made the 16-year-old plant ready to resume
operations.
   But Dukakis leads a legion of critics who point to a 1987 report
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which found that the
plans to evacuate suburban residents around Pilgrim were inadequate.
The plant is 40 miles south of Boston.
   Pilgrim officials said they expected the restart to take four
months, beginning before Jan. 1.
   ``Today's vote is an insult to the local officials and South
Shore residents who have shown convincingly that no emergency
evacuation plan can safely protect the public,'' said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has again
demonstrated its disregard for public safety.''

   Art collector Robert Berdella told
investigators his fascination with the 1965 movie ``The Collector''
may help explain why he tied up six men and sexually tortured them
before killing them.
   The movie starring Terrence Stamp and Samantha Eggar is about a
man who keeps a woman in chains in his basement hoping she will fall
in love with him. She eventually dies of pneumonia.
   ``He said he had seen that movie several years ago and that he
may have fantasized about living out what was depicted in that
movie,'' said Sgt. Troy Cole, who headed the investigation into the
killings.
   Berdella first described the movie during the three days he was
interviewed last week, and then remembered its title, said Det.
Albert DeValkenaere.
   ``Sometimes he just would head off in other directions,''
DeValkenaere said. ``He didn't come right out and say this (the
movie) is why'' he killed the men.
   Berdella had remained silent about his motives since his arrest
in April. He reached agreement to confess to the killings to avoid
the death penalty.
   Berdella, who had admitted one murder earlier, confessed to five
more Monday and was given life prison sentences in the deaths.
   Two of the victims suffocated, one died of blood loss and
infection from being sexually tortured and three others died of a
combination of being gagged and injected with animal tranquilizers.
   Berdella kept the victims tied to a bed in his midtown Kansas
City home until their deaths.
   Berdella owned a flea-market shop, Bob's Bazaar Bizarre, where he
sold trinkets from around the world as well as jewelry he designed
himself. Most of his collected artifacts, including 2,000-year-old
Roman vials said to be filled with tears, Tibetan exorcism knives,
costume masks from Sri Lanka and puppets from Asia and Thailand,
were sold at an auction to help pay his legal bills.

   Mayor Tom Bradley will try his hand at acting
next month, playing himself in the 100th episode of NBC's crime
drama ``Hunter.''
   Bradley was invited to appear after expressing an interest in the
series starring Fred Dryer and Stephanie Kramer, said producer
George Geiger.
   Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor has made cameo
appearances in the past on shows, including ``Matlock.''
   A special three-part script entitled ``City Under Siege''
features a female criminal Hunter extradited a decade earlier to Los
Angeles and launching a crime spree.
   Her violent crimes lead to vigilantism, which Hunter tries to
counter with a task force.
   Filming takes place in January and the scheduled air dates are
Feb. 4, 11 and 18.

   Sen. Bob Graham donned an apron and
joined volunteers feeding the hungry and homeless at a soup kitchen
then helped distribute food baskets to the needy in the Tampa Bay
area.
   Graham, D-Fla., spent an hour Wednesday in a serving line at St.
Vincent de Paul's soup kitchen, where 160 poor and homeless sat down
to a hot meal of soup, turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
   ``In Washington, we deal with issues in very big numbers and
broad programs,'' said Graham. ``Here you deal one-on-one with human
beings who are hungry, sick, emotionally disturbed. I want to learn
as much as I can from the people affected.''
   For the senator it was a workday, an idea he adopted in 1974
while running for the state senate in Florida to occasionally spend
a day doing what ordinary people do. The volunteer job was his 222nd
workday.
   Bob Thue, executive director of the kitchen, said Graham's visit
``was a beautiful Christmas gift to those people. He put on an apron
and went to work. And he talked to them about their problems.
   ``To treat them like human beings doesn't sound like much, but
it's a lot for some,'' said Thue.

   Developer Donald Trump marked the
restart of construction on his newly purchased Taj Mahal casino
project by inviting guests into a chilly arena and snipping a gilded
ribbon.
   Although some construction workers are already at work in the
massive structure, more than 1,000 more will be added by February
and another 1,000 in the spring, Trump said. The casino is expected
to open in early 1990, becoming Trump's third gaming hall in
Atlantic City.
   Work on the 1,250-room structure was delayed for a year while
Trump and entertainer Merv Griffin worked out details of the sale of
Resorts International Inc. In the deal, Trump took control of the
Taj Mahal and left most of the rest of Resorts' holdings to Griffin.
   ``We're working very hard to straighten out what Resorts couldn't
do,'' Trump said Wednesday.
   Resorts broke ground in 1983 on the Boardwalk project near
Resorts' hotel.
   Trump, meanwhile also said he's decided not to sell the largest
undeveloped plot of land in New York City's Manhattan borough after
all. He said he'll move ahead with plans to build the world's
tallest building on the 76-acre riverfront site.

   Swiss author Friedrich Duerrenmatt is
bequeathing his entire literary estate to the Swiss government.
   A government spokesman said that Duerrenmatt, one of the world's
most widely produced modern dramatists, told Interior Minister
Flavio Cotti during a recent meeting that the estate will include
all his manuscripts, as well as many of his paintings.
   The spokesman, Achille Casanova, said the manuscripts are to be
kept in a future ``Archive of Swiss Literature'' that would also
include parts of the estates of writers Hermann Hesse and Rainer
Maria Rilke.
   Duerrenmatt, 67, has been a prolific author throughout his adult
life. His plays and prose fill more than 30 volumes. His most
successful plays, ``The Visit'' and ``The Physicists,'' have been
translated into more than 50 languages.

   Country singer Lee Greenwood's mother's
penchant for stitchery kits is going to benefit a youth emergency
shelter and a senior citizens' group.
   Greenwood has donated 500 kits, worth $10,000, to the Oasis
Center, which provides emergency shelter and other services for
young people.
   The Oasis Center, in turn, gave the kits to Senior Citizens Inc.,
a nonprofit organization that runs a day care center and provides
other services for the elderly.
   The senior citizens are selling the kits for an average price of
$10 and will split the proceeds with the center, said Mary Flanagan,
director of community relations at Oasis.
   Greenwood had been given the kits by his mother, who had
accumulated too many of them, said Kelly Morris, the singer's
daughter.
   ``She had no place to put them anymore,'' Ms. Morris said. ``It
was something she did in her spare time, and there is no way she
will be able to do all of those.''
   Both organizations are United Way groups and Greenwood is a
former honorary chairman of United Way, Flanagan said Wednesday.
   Greenwood is best known for his song ``God Bless the USA.''

   Syracuse University officials expressed shock
Wednesday on learning that 38 of their students were booked on the
Pan Am jumbo jet that crashed in Scotland with 258 people aboard,
and anxious relatives gathered at Kennedy Airport.
   At the campus in Syracuse, more than 25,000 people attending a
basketball game paused for a minute of silence and a brief prayer by
the university minister. About 500 mourners sat in silence and lit
candles at a later prayer service led by chaplains of five faiths
Wednesday night.
   The Rev. Paul Kowalewski, a Protestant chaplain, said the
ceremony filled a need in the university community.
   ``We gathered because we needed to come together. The students
needed to demonstrate their sorrow, to be with one another,''
Kowalewski said.
   ``Its going to be hard to think about Christmas this year,'' said
Chris Healy, a junior from Seaford, N.Y. ``All I can think about is
their parents, some of them haven't seen their kids since August.''
   Chancellor Melvin Eggers called the crash, in which Scottish
police said no survivors were found, the ``greatest tragedy in the
university's history.''
   ``It's hard to put into words the jolt and shock this kind of
thing gives a person,'' he said at a news conference. ``I kept
asking how will we face the next few hours.''
   Neither Pan Am nor the university would release passenger names
before Thursday, saying the list still had to be compiled and
relatives notified.
   However, some names were announced by other sources.
   James Fuller, 50, vice president in charge of Volkswagen United
States Inc., and Lou Marengo, 33, the company's marketing director,
had boarding passes for Flight 103 and apparently died in the crash,
Volkswagen spokesman Tom McDonald said in Troy, Mich.
   There were 38 Syracuse students booked on Pan Am Flight 103 from
London to New York, and 36 were confirmed to have been aboard,
Eggers said.
   University officials planned a prayer service Wednesday night.
They said they would have canceled the game, but heard of the crash
too late.
   The students were part of a group of about 250, mostly juniors,
selected for study in Europe based on their academic standing and
ability to adapt to a foreign country, said Lore Heath, associate
director of the university's Division of International Programs
Abroad.
   The program includes the cost of their flight over, but students
made their own arrangements for return travel, Heath said. The
semester's program ended Saturday.
   Flight 103 was scheduled to stop in New York, where some
passengers were to change planes and depart for Detroit under the
same flight number, to arrive early Thursday.
   At the Pan Am terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport,
people arriving to meet the plane were escorted to a private area by
security personnel.
   ``My baby, my baby,'' sobbed one woman who was supported by
security officers as she was led to an elevator.
   A young man approached an information booth, saying he had a
relative on the flight, and was immediately surrounded by
photographers. He knocked one of the cameras to the ground before
going to the waiting area.
   ``Things are bad enough _ let's let them get the people who are
meeting the airplane up there,'' said one of the security officers.
A pathway to the elevator was then cordoned off.
   A woman whose son, a 21-year-old Syracuse University student, was
on the plane, found herself surrounded by cameras. Sobbing, she
looked up and said, ``Look, my son is dead, what else do you want?''
   A Red Cross spokeswoman, Carla Abell, said the room where friends
and relatives of about 25 families were taken was like ``a hospital
waiting room.''
   ``There's a lot of fear, there's a lot of total numbness,'' she
said. ``Some people are collapsing.''
   On the television screens listing arrivals, beside Flight 103 was
the message, ``SEE AGT,'' for ``see agent.''
   At Pan Am headquarters in Manhattan, Jeffrey Kriendler, vice
president for corporate communications, said at a news conference
that it was too early to speculate on the crash's cause.
   ``We have no indication there were any problems,'' he said.
``There was no contact from the captain or any of the crew members.
There were no problems, no indication whatsoever prior to the flight
that there were any problems on board that aircraft.''
   He said the airline was sending crash experts from around the
country to the site.
   The crew included three cockpit personnel based in New York and
12 flight attendants stationed in London, he said.
   The plane had been through a routine check ``within the past
week,'' Kriendler said.
   He said Pan Am had not received any threats in recent months.

   Erica Sherover-Marcuse, who created
workshops to combat racism and was the widow of philosopher Herbert
Marcuse, has died at age 49 after a three-year battle with breast
cancer.
   Sherover-Marcuse, who died Dec. 15 at her home here, devoted the
last 10 years of her life to her workshops.
   She conducted them for small groups as well as large gatherings
in institutional settings, focused on helping participants to take
pride in their own heritage as a means of building alliances with
racial minorities, said David Weingarten, a friend for 12 years and
former classmate in Boston.
   Her goal was to help people understand that ``racism was a
catastrophe also for white people,'' said Weingarten. ``She always
thought that the way you change institutions was to change the
individual first.''
   In 1976, she married Marcuse, the political philosopher and
professor at the University of California, San Diego.
   Marcuse, who traveled around the world in the 1960s and has been
described as the ``guru of the left,'' died in 1979 at age 81.
   Survivors include a sister.

   NASA must quickly fix Atlantis'
broken tiles and cracked bearing and ready lagging Columbia for a
July flight if it is to launch seven space shuttles in 1989, the
Kennedy Space Center's director says.
   ``I think the schedule in 1989 is realistic and reasonable and we
ought to go for it, but it's not going to be a no-sweat piece of
cake,'' said Forrest S. McCartney in a yearend interview on
Wednesday.
   ``If we can do it safely, we'll do it,'' he said.
   He said the launches of Discovery and Atlantis on Sept. 29 and
Dec. 2 demonstrated the United States has rebounded from the
Challenger disaster of 1986 and is ready to move forward with the
shuttle program.
   An immediate key to meeting next year's schedule, McCartney said,
is the resolution of the two unexpected problems that developed
during the Atlantis mission.
   Atlantis returned to Earth with severe damage to nearly 200 of
the 28,000 thermal tiles that protect it from atmospheric re-entry
heat. And when engineers inspected the craft's main engines, they
found a tiny crack in a bearing in a liquid oxygen pump.
   It is believed insulation peeling off the shuttle's external fuel
tank struck the tiles during launch. A National Aeronautics and
Space Administration team is investigating the cause, but McCartney
said it probably won't have a solution until early in the year.
   ``We've got to find out what caused it and stop it, because
that's clearly not an acceptable condition for flying,'' he said.
   ``If you've got a bearing that's cracked in Atlantis, you can bet
your sweet bippy we're not going to fly Discovery until we
understand more about that bearing and feel good about it,''
McCartney said.
   He said similar cracks had been discovered after earlier flights,
and he predicted the bearing and tile problems would be resolved in
time for Discovery, the next shuttle slated for flight, to meet its
scheduled Feb. 18 launch with a crew of five astronauts and a
communications satellite.
   A longer range key to meeting the schedule is whether the third
shuttle, Columbia, will be ready for a July launch date.
   Columbia for the most part sat on the sidelines last year while
workers concentrated on refitting Discovery and Atlantis with 200
modifications developed after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger
explosion that killed seven astronauts.
   ``We've got a lot of work to do on Columbia, but I'm encouraged
with the way it's coming along,'' McCartney said.
   ``It will be a hell of a horse race all the way down, but there's
no reason to believe we can't get the work done and support the
present schedule.''
   Here's the projected schedule:
   Feb. 18 _ Discovery, with a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite.
   April 28 _ Atlantis, to dispatch the Magellan spacecraft to map
the planet Venus.
   July 1 _ Columbia on a Defense Department mission.
   Aug. 10 _ Discovery on a Defense Department mission.
   Oct. 12 _ Atlantis, to release the Galileo spacecraft to explore
the planet Jupiter.
   Nov. 13 _ Columbia, to deploy a Syncom communications satellite
and to retrieve for return to Earth a scientific satellite called
LDEF that was placed in orbit in 1984.
   Dec. 11 _ Discovery, to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope.

   The jumbo jet that crashed Wednesday in
Scotland had a maintenance history that included an on-board fire,
cracks and corrosion, it was reported.
   Service records filed with the Federal Aviation Administration
show that since 1980, the Boeing 747 experienced at least 24
mechanical difficulties severe enough to warrant notation, the Los
Angeles Times reported in Thursday's edition.
   In 1980, five reports were filed, including one that cited a
crack and one that cited failure of the plane to turn when it was on
autopilot. Another difficulty involved a flame-out of an engine
during cruise flight, the newspaper said.
   Reports in 1981 and 1983 cited numerous cracks in the plane's
floor beams and a floor beam web; a 1984 report detailed fractures
in exhaust casing rails and trailing edge flaps that were locked in
place, the Times said.
   The cause of Wednesday's crash was not determined.
   The Pan Am 747-100, tail number N739PA, was delivered to Pan
American in February 1970. It was the 15th 747 built. The first 747
ever delivered to an airline _ also Pan Am _ entered the fleet the
previous month, said David Jimenez, spokesman for Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, which builds 747s in Everett, Wash.
   The plane that crashed had about 16,500 cycles, with one cycle
being a takeoff and a landing, Jimenez said. That, however, is not
considered a particularly high number of cycles for a commercial
jetliner, he said. A high number is considered to be more than
50,000, he said.
   By comparison, the Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 that lost part of
its fuselage during a flight over Hawaii last April had more than
89,000 cycles, a factor that was investigated in determining whether
metal fatigue caused part of the fuselage to rip away.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the plane that crashed was
taken out of service between April 11, 1987, and Sept. 27, 1987, for
substantial modification work, and any structural deficiencies
observed earlier would have been corrected then.
   Service difficulty reports filed in 1987 when the plane was out
of service detailed corrosion and cracks, the largest, found near
the upper part of the fuselage bulkhead, measured 16.3 inches, the
Times said. A 2.2-inch crack was found in a splice plate, a joint
area between metal parts, the Times said. Moderate-to-severe
corrosion also was found on those splice plates, the Times said.
   Other service difficulties cited in 1987 include a sheared nose
gear bolt, a missing pylon panel, two instances of smoke in the
passenger cabin and fire spewing from an engine pylon, the newspaper
said.
   Problems were reported after the plane was returned to service.
   In October 1987, maintenance personnel responding to a Boeing
bulletin found severe corrosion at the rear bulkhead of the aircraft
and severe corrosion on a portion of its fuselage, the newspaper
said.
   A report in 1988 noted that a leading edge slat fell off the
plane during takeoff from Pakistan, the newspaper said.
   Another Boeing spokesman, Paul Fang, said the manufacturer would
not release service records on any plane ``because once the
airplanes are out of here they're not our property anymore.''
   Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler declined immediate comment on the
report about the plane's maintenance record.
   Pan Am said in New York that the jetliner was part of the Civil
Reserve Air Fleet, a program to provide planes to the government in
the event of national emergency.
   Fang later confirmed the plane was converted by Boeing in
Wichita, Kan., in 1987 to make it cargo-capable in 48 hours for the
national emergency program. The Air Force pays for the modification,
but it was not able to convince most airlines to participate, Fang
said, so the conversion, involving adding a cargo door and
strengthening the floor, was not a common procedure.
   The Federal Aviation Administration's Mike Monroney Aeronautical
Center in Oklahoma City has only two repair and alteration forms on
file for the Pan Am plane. A conveyance examiner who declined to
give her name said such reports are not required and are sometimes
submitted voluntarily by airlines.
   The records show that in 1971, a rear spar fitting assembly was
repaired in Brussels, Belgium, according to one document.
   In 1974, the plane had a ``turnaround modification'' at the
Boeing division in Seattle, according to the other document.
   Jimenez said he did not know specifically what either of those
servicings would involve, but added: ``They're nothing that would
say, `Hey, I'm excited.' Just normal, normal stuff.''
   Over the years, Pan Am has bought 45 747s from Boeing, according
to Tom Cole, another Boeing spokesman. As of September 1988, Pan Am
still had 38 747s in its fleet, he said.
   To date, Boeing has sold 883 747s of all models worldwide, Cole
said. Of those, there have been 18 recorded ``hull losses'' in
accidents or terrorist acts. Four, including Wednesday's, involved
Pan Am planes, Jimenez said.
   A Pan Am 747 was one of two jets involved in the worst disaster
in commercial aviation history: the March 27, 1977, collision
between two 747s at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, in which 582
people died.

   A Pan Am jumbo jet bound for New York
with 258 Christmas travelers crashed Wednesday in a Scottish
village, exploding in a huge fireball, destroying 40 homes and
spreading burning wreckage for 10 miles.
   No survivors were found from the Boeing 747, according to John
Boyd, the police chief for the area. Royal Air Force rescuers said
the plane ``demolished two rows of houses. There are no survivors
from those houses.''
   The jetliner, Pan Am Flight 103, crashed in the heart of the
village of Lockerbie, 10 miles northeast of Dumfries in southern
Scotland, about an hour after departing London's Heathrow Airport.
   A Heathrow spokesman said three children were on the plane, and
many of the passengers were laden with Christmas gifts. There were
15 crew members among the 258 people aboard.
   ``The aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion,'' said
Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, because wreckage was scattered
over a very wide area. But Rifkind, who arrived early Thursday with
U.S. Ambassador Charles Price, refused to speculate on the cause.
   Police, airline and Civil Aviation officials also said they had
no idea what caused the crash. The only possibility immediately
ruled out by the Civil Aviation Authority was a collision with
another aircraft.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in Thursday's editions that the
jet had a maintenance history that included an on-board fire, cracks
and corrosion. Delivered to Pan Am in 1970, it underwent a
structural modification in 1987.
   Pan Am said there was no communication with the cockpit that
indicated any problem before the crash. Civil aviation officials
said Scottish air traffic controllers had been talking routinely to
the jet until minutes before the crash, when the pilot was asked a
question and no reply was received.
   Shortly after that, the plane disappeared from the radar screen
at about 7:15 p.m. (2:15 p.m. EST) without issuing a distress
signal, said CAA spokesman Richard Wright.
   New York's Syracuse University said it confirmed that 36 of its
students studying abroad were on the plane and that two others held
tickets for the flight, but it was uncertain if they were aboard.
   There were unconfirmed reports some U.S. servicemen were aboard.
   In Thursday's editions, The Washington Post quoted a State
Department spokesman as saying six members of the department's
Diplomatic Security Service, who were returning from Beirut, were
aboard the jet. State Department spokesman Ben Justesen said he
could not confirm the report.
   The U.N. commissioner for Namibia, Bernt Carlsson, 50, of Sweden,
also was a passenger, said U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani. On
Thursday, representatives from South Africa, Cuba and Angola are to
sign a pact that begins an independence plan for Namibia.
   Also aboard were John Mulroy, The Associated Press director of
international communications, and his son, Sean, and
daughter-in-law, Ingrid.
   Two American Volkswagen executives were believed on the plane.
James Fuller, 50, vice president in charge of Volkswagen United
States Inc., and Lou Marengo, 33, the marketing director of the
Troy, Mich.-based automaker, had boarding passes for the flight,
said Volkswagen spokesman Tom McDonald.
   ``It is obviously still too early to put a precise figure on the
number of dead and injured but indications suggest there were no
survivors from the aircraft,'' Boyd told a news conference.
   The RAF Rescue and Coordination Center said two rows of houses _
about 40 in all _ were demolished and ``a rescue situation does not
exist any more. We are just recovering bodies.''
   Boyd said five cars traveling along the a highway near Lockerbie
were hit by parts of the aircraft and no one inside them survived.
   The plane was in pieces before it plunged into the village of
2,500, plowing down a street and crashing into a highway bypass
outside Lockerbie.
   The blue-and-white nose section, bearing the Pan Am Clipper's
name Maid of the Seas, landed in a muddy field near a church at the
village of Tundergarth, 3 miles from Lockerbie. Orange life jackets
and a dinghy lay nearby.
   Police standing by the wreckage said several bodies were found in
nearby woods.
   Witnesses to the crash described an approaching roar, then a huge
bang followed by a 300-foot tower of flame. Burning debris rained on
the town, scattering debris and chunks of smoldering metal.
   ``We thought it was an earthquake, but it was above us,'' said
villager Cathy Gilmour. ``We saw this great ball of fire, as if it
were stars.''
   Helicopters, ambulances and mountain rescue teams rushed to the
village in southwest Scotland. Traffic jams blocked access, and the
village square was sealed off for fear that a gas station hit in the
crash could blow up.
   Lockerbrie resident Sheila McDonald was delivering Christmas
presents to a friend's home on a hillside overlooking the town when
she heard ``a horrible droning sound.''
   ``This V-shaped object just seemed to come flying through the air
... it was the wings and front section of an aircraft ... another
part came just behind and all around seemed to be red dots like
sparks,'' she said.
   ``It hit some houses in the town and there was a mass of flame
and everything just started to shake.''
   Police said wreckage was strewn over 10 miles.
   ``Wreckage has fallen at six different locations both within
Lockerbie and some miles outside the town. There are bodies at each
of these locations,'' Boyd, told a news conference.
   Villager John Glasgow said: ``The whole road was ablaze. Two
houses were blazing. The road was completely covered with masonry,
garden gates and apparently parts of the plane, but not very big
parts. There was a lot of smoking debris on fire. It looked as if
the road was burning.''
   ``There was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up and the
sky was actually raining fire,'' said Mike Carnahan, a resident who
was a few hundred yards from the scene.

   ``It was just like liquid. We have actually found an aluminum
rivet embedded in the metal of my car,'' Carnahan told the British
Broadcasting Corp. television.
   Carnahan said he believed the plane was on fire before it crashed
because ``it was trailing flames when it went over the village.''
   Flight 103 had taken off 25 minutes late and was at 31,000 feet
when contact was lost, the Heathrow Airport Authority said.
   The aircraft was following its exact flight plan, said Jeffrey
Kriendler, a spokesman for Pan American World Airways in New York.
   ``Nothing would suggest that weather was a factor, especially
since we believe it happened at altitude,'' he said.
   A collision with another aircraft also was ruled out.
   ``We have rerun radar records and these indicate there were
apparently no other aircraft in the vicinity,'' said Wright, the
civil aviation spokesman.
   The jet took off from Heathrow at 1:25 p.m. EST and disappeared
off radar screens an hour later, said Pat Coffey, spokesman for the
RAF Rescue Coordination Center near Edinburgh, Scotland.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, using a Boeing
727, with passengers who continued on to New York boarding a Boeing
747 in London. That plane normally connects with another 727 flying
from New York to Detroit.
   Conrad Jacoby, the Pan Am chief for central Europe, told the ZDF
television network that 48 people had boarded the flight in
Frankfurt. It was not known how many of them got on the Boeing 747.
   Air Force Maj. Mike Stepp, a spokesman for the Defense
Department, said he had no information on whether any U.S. military
personnel were aboard.
   The airline did not release a passenger list.
   At the Pan Am terminal at Kennedy International Airport in New
York, a TV monitor told people waiting for Flight 103 to ``see
agent.'' At the Clipper Club, a lounge for waiting passengers, a Pan
Am employee turned down the sound on a TV set when a report of the
crash was broadcast.
   Another witness, hotelier Graham Byerley, said the fireball from
the plane towered 200 to 300 feet into the air.
   Carnahan said: ``All I could see was flames and fire ... I could
see several houses on the skyline whose roofs were totally off and
all you could see was flaming timbers and what was left of the
houses.''
   Les Callaghan, spokesman for Dumfries and Galloway Royal
Infirmary, said the hospital treated about 12 people believed to be
local residents hurt when the plane crashed in the village of 2,500.
   A Pan Am 727 left London early Thursday for Scotland carrying
airline representatives, British Department of Transport officials
and a Boeing technical representative to assist in work at the crash
site, said airline spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon in New York.
   Other Pan Am officials were en route from New York, she said.
   In addition, National Transportation Safety Board officials from
Washington were dispatched to the scene to help with the
investigation.
   The crashed jet was delivered to Pan Am in February 1970, said
David Jimenez, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Everett,
Wash. It had about 16,500 cycles, with one cycle being a takeoff and
a landing, Jimenez said. That is not considered a particularly high
number for a commercial jetliner, he said.
   The Aloha Airlines 737 that lost part of its fuselage in flight
in April had more than 89,000 cycles, a factor that was investigated
in determining whether metal fatigue caused part of the fuselage to
rip away.
   Service records filed with the Federal Aviation Administration
show that since 1980, the 747 that crashed Wednesday experienced at
least 24 mechanical difficulties severe enough to warrant notation,
the Los Angeles Times reported.
   In 1980, five reports were filed, including one that cited a
crack and one that cited failure of the plane to turn when it was on
autopilot. Another difficulty involved a flame-out of an engine
during cruise flight, the newspaper said.
   Reports in 1981 and 1983 cited numerous cracks in the plane's
floor beams and a floor beam web; a 1984 report detailed fractures
in exhaust casing rails and trailing edge flaps that were locked in
place, the Times said.
   Pan Am said the jetliner was part of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet,
a program to provide planes to the U.S. government in the event of
national emergency. It was converted by Boeing in Wichita, Kan., in
1987 to make it cargo-capable in 48 hours for the national emergency
program, the airline said.
   The Air Force pays for the modification, but it was unable to
convince most airlines to participate, said Boeing spokesman Paul
Fang, so the conversion, involving adding a cargo door and
strengthening the floor, was not a common procedure.
   A Japan Air Lines 747 crashed Aug. 12, 1985, killing 520 people.
It was the worst single-plane aircraft accident in history. Boeing
later admitted its faulty repairs were one of the causes of the
crash, which was attributed to a crack in the rear cabin wall that
caused a sudden loss of pressure. The force of the air tore the
plane's tail apart.
   The FAA in 1986 ordered a modification of all Boeing 747s as a
result of that crash.
   Two Boeing 747 jets collided on a runway in the Canary Islands in
1977, killing more than 500 people.
   Pan Am suffered a major crash involving one of its airplanes in
July 1982, when a Boeing 727 crashed after taking off from New
Orleans International Airport in a thunderstorm, killing 154 people.

   An Army intelligence analyst who boasted of
spying for greed and a Turkish-born Floridian were arrested for
selling ``highly sensitive'' documents to East Bloc agents over six
years, authorities said.
   Warrant Officer James William Hall III, 30, who is stationed at
nearby Fort Stewart and served in West Germany, was arrested here
Wednesday and taken to the base detention facility, said Lt. Col.
John Chapala, an Army spokesman in Washington.
   Huseyin Yildirim was arrested at his home in Belleair Beach,
Fla., near St. Petersburg, and was scheduled to appear before a U.S.
magistrate in Tampa, Fla., for a bond hearing this afternoon.
   Yildirim, a 60-year-old Turkish native, was charged with
conspiracy to commit espionage by giving agents of a foreign
government national defense secrets, said Ed Dutko, an agent in the
FBI's Savannah office. If convicted, Yildirim could be sentenced to
life in prison.
   Hall has not yet been formally charged, Chapala said.
   ``Hall, as a member of the military, can be charged with a
similar offense by the military and court-martialed,'' Dutko said.
``Yildirim is a civilian, so he faces civilian charges.''
   Chapala said he could provide nothing ``on the classification or
nature of the information allegedly provided by Hall or to whom it
went.''
   But published reports today said the espionage inflicted serious
damage on electronic spying efforts in Europe, although the damage
was still being assessed.
   Hall's home in Richmond Hill and Yildirim's home were searched
Wednesday by FBI and Army intelligence officers, the FBI said.
   The arrests followed a meeting at a Savannah hotel Tuesday night
between Hall and an FBI agent posing as a Soviet intelligence
officer, according to an affidavit FBI agent Charles B. Youmans Jr.
filed Wednesday with U.S. Magistrate G.R. Smith here.
   Hall told the unidentified agent ``that he had been passing
highly sensitive signal intelligence documents to both the Soviets
and the East German intelligence services since late 1982,'' the
affidavit said.
   ``Hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information
he had passed, and admitted his motivation to be greed,'' the
document said. It did not give details on the information.
   Hall said Yildirim participated in the copying of the documents
and acted as the Army man's courier and paymaster until last
January, the affidavit said. The affidavit said Hall was paid in
U.S. and German currency, but did not say how much he made.
   Hall also told the undercover agent that Yildirim contacted him
after his transfer to Fort Stewart and met with him in Savannah, the
document said.
   Hall has spent most of his Army career as a signals
intelligence-electronics warfare analyst, working on intercepted
radio traffic, telephone conversations and coded messages, Chapala
said.
   The New York City native joined the Army in 1976. The first of
three European assignments came the following year, when he was
assigned to an Army security agency company in Schneeberg, West
Germany, Chapala said.
   In 1981, Hall went to West Berlin, where he again worked in a
signals intelligence assignment.
   Hall returned to the United States in 1985 and was assigned to a
military intelligence group at Fort Monmouth, N.J. In 1986, he
returned to West Germany, serving in a military intelligence
battalion in Frankfurt.
   He was sent back to the United States in May 1987, and was
assigned to Fort Stewart last July.
   Chapala said there was no indication of any connection between
Hall's arrest and another military spy case last summer involving
NATO secrets.
   A former U.S. Army sergeant, Clyde Lee Conrad, was arrested in
that case in West Germany last August, and two Hungarian-born
brothers were sentenced to 18 months in prison in October in Sweden
for relaying NATO information to Hungary. Investigators said Conrad
reported to a Hungarian spymaster living in Vienna, Austria.

<HEAD>New Treatment Turns Body's Own Cancer Weapons Against Tumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors giving patients high doses of
cancer-fighting cells taken from their tumors have turned back
lethal skin cancer at a rate nearly four times greater than by using
chemotherapy, scientists reported today.
   The work is the latest development in a new strategy of revving
up the body's own weapons to stop cancer. However, experts say this
approach is still highly experimental, and no one knows whether it
will turn out to be a practical way to fight disease.
   Only one of the 20 patients treated has had a lasting remission
after more than a year, but doctors were encouraged because most of
the patients had at least partial responses.
   The study was directed by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, who has
developed the strategy known as adoptive immunotherapy at the
National Cancer Institute. In earlier attempts, he used a natural
chemical called interleukin-2 to prime cancer-fighting cells taken
from the blood. These cells were then turned loose inside the body
to hunt for cancer.
   His latest effort, described in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, is a refinement of that approach. Instead of using cells
from the bloodstream, he drew killing cells from patient's own
tumors, multiplied them and injected them back.
   ``We are finally zeroing in on the important cells, and he is
getting better numbers to indicate that the strategy is the right
one,'' said Dr. Malcolm S. Mitchell of the University of Southern
California.
   Rosenberg said the new approach, used so far on patients with the
skin cancer melanoma, is more potent and less toxic than his earlier
treatment.
   ``The first treatment, which we have now used in over 400
patients, is a first step,'' he said. ``Now we are seeing an
improvement upon it. Hopefully, there will be improvements beyond
this.''
   In experimental use, they found that the latest approach shrank
the tumors of 55 percent of advanced melanoma patients. Ordinary
chemotherapy produces a response in about 20 percent of such
patients.
   ``This is very exciting,'' commented Dr. Michael Atkins of New
England Medical Center. ``I hope it will give us clues as to where
to go next. But it shouldn't be considered applicable to the general
patient population.''
   Other experts were also cautious about the new therapy.
   ``It offers potentially a more specific approach,'' said Dr.
Richard Fisher of Loyola University Medical Center in Chicago.
``Whether that will turn out to be better is unknown, although in
his early data, he has an impressive number of responses.''
   The treatment is based on a variety of cancer-killing cells,
known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, that are taken from the
patient's own cancer.
   ``They have unique specificity for the tumor from which they are
derived,'' said Rosenberg. ``Presumably they are part of the host
defense against the tumor, but there are not enough of them.''
   After being grown outside the body in interleukin-2, the
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are returned to the patient, along
with extra doses of interleukin-2 and a chemotherapy drug.
   After one treatment, melanoma shrank in nine of 15 patients who
had never received interleukin-2. They also regressed in two of five
patients who had failed earlier treatment with interleukin-2.
   The tumors that shrank had spread to other parts of the body,
including the lungs, liver and bones. The cancer disappeared
completely in one 56-year-old man, who remains cancer free about 15
months after the treatment ended.
   Until now, using interleukin-2 alone or combining this substance
with treated blood cells has produced a response in about
one-quarter of melanoma patients.
   The latest approach, Rosenberg said, ``is giving the highest
response rate I'm aware of in patients with melanoma. But it's only
20 patients, so it's got to be considered very preliminary.''
   The latest approach was less toxic because it required smaller
doses of interleukin-2. Among the dangerous effects of the substance
are heart attacks, severe confusion, fluid retention, low blood
pressure, kidney impairment and liver congestion.

<HEAD>Gonzalez Seeks Conciliation With Unions After General Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has agreed to
some demands for higher wages and pensions made by labor unions
whose general strike brought the country to a standstill last week.
   In a speech to Parliament on Wednesday, the 46-year-old Socialist
_ a former labor lawyer _ pledged to increase wages of civil
servants and raise the lowest pensions to the legal mininum wage,
the equivalent of $394 a month. He also said he would withdraw a
controversial youth employment program.
   But Gonzalez rejected union demands that the government broaden
availability of unemployment insurance from 30 percent to 48 percent
of the 2.7 million jobless and recognize civil servants' right to
enter collective bargaining.
   He also ruled out calling early elections, which now must be held
by June 1990.
   In a Dec. 14 general strike, 7.8 million of the country's 11.8
workers stayed off the job to call for a bigger share in the
country's booming economy.
   The strike called by the Socialist General Workers Union and the
Communist Workers Commissions brought nearly all industrial,
commercial and labor activity to a halt.
   Gonzalez offered to meet today with union leaders and the head of
the country's key business organization after acknowledging before
the 350-seat lower house that the strike represented political
failure for his government.
   Antonio Gutierrez, head of the Workers Commissions, said
Wednesday he did not plan to join the meeting with the Spanish
Employers Organization president Jose Maria Cuevas. But he said he
would meet with Gonzalez and other union leaders later.
   Both unions said their leaders would not attend today's meeting
if Gonzalez insisted business' top leader be present. Gonzalez said
if the labor leaders failed to show up he would meet with them
Friday or Saturday.
   The prime minister has urged unions to negotiate their
differences with the government to maintain the economy's current 5
percent annual growth rate.

   A gene found to be key to schizophrenia
medication will trigger ``an avalanche of research'' that could
improve treatment for psychosis, Parkinson's disease and other brain
ailments, a scientist says.
   Scientists worldwide ``have really been poised to take advantage
of this development,'' which could provide insights into the body's
potential role in mental illness, said Kenneth L. Davis, chairman of
the psychiatry department at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
New York.
   The results could include improved treatments for diseases that
include psychosis, which is a loss of touch with reality seen in
schizophrenia and sometimes in depression, manic-depression and
other disorders, he said.
   It also could lead to better treatment of Parkinson's disease,
which is often characterized by tremors and rigidity, Huntington's
disease, which hinders movement and intellectual abilities, and
Tourette syndrome, which includes jerky movements and vocal
mannerisms, Davis and other researchers said.
   Davis was responding to a report in today's issue of the British
journal Nature.
   In the article, researchers said they had isolated the gene that
acts as a blueprint for a protein called the D-2 dopamine receptor,
which is made by brain cells. The receptor, which sits on the
surface of the cells, is where anti-psychosis drugs exert their
effects on the brain.
   Normally, the receptor's role is to respond when adjacent brain
cells secrete a substance called dopamine, allowing brain cells to
communicate.
   The defining of one receptor in the past has led to discovery of
a related family of them, Davis said. If a family of dopamine
receptors is found, scientists may be able to design drugs that
affect only the receptors linked to disease and avoid side effects
of current medications, he said.
   Side effects of current anti-psychosis medications, for example,
include tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of involuntary movements of
the mouth, tongue, limbs or trunk.
   In the study, researchers said they identified the receptor gene
in rats, defined its chemical makeup and made functioning copies of
it. Since then, they also have isolated and partially defined the
human receptor gene, Olivier Civelli said in a telephone interview.
   The researcher reports the work in Nature with James Bunzow and
others at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, and
with researchers at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in
Portland and the Oregon Regional Primate Center in Beaverton.
   Other scientists called the discovery an important boost for
research into the dopamine receptor.
   Davis predicted ``an avalanche of research'' by investigators.
   ``We've all been waiting for it,'' he said.
   ``This is an important and essentially fundamental step'' in
helping scientists understand how anti-psychotic drugs work, ``and
thereby indirectly understand what may be the biological mechanism
underlying psychotic disorders.''
   Scientists also may be able to learn about the mechanisms that
turn the receptor gene on and off, which may shed light on
schizophrenia, he said.
   In addition, focusing on the receptor gene may help scientists
study the inheritance of a tendency toward schizophrenia and perhaps
other diseases, said Arnold Friedhoff, psychiatry professor at the
New York University Medical Center. That in turn could lead to
better matching of patients to proper medications, he said.
   He said other follow-up studies could help scientists understand
the overall dopamine communication network among brain cells, which
is ``undoubtedly going to provide extremely important new insights
into its role ... in regulating mental processes.''
   Since it is the target of drugs that ease psychosis caused by a
wide range of conditions, it ``must have a regulatory role in
keeping things on track,'' he said.
   ``The more we understand about its function, the more likely it
is we'll be able to not only treat mental illness, but in the long
run prevent it,'' Friedhoff said.

   Home for the holidays for the nation's growing legions of
homeless could be under a bridge in Oklahoma City, a cardboard box
in Philadelphia, or the streets in the nation's capital for those
with no bed of their own.
   In New York City, the estimated number of homeless has increased
25 percent during the last year with the total estimated between
60,000 and 90,000; in Portland, Ore., the number rose 10 to 20
percent each year this decade.
   ``The need doesn't stop with Christmas,'' said Salvation Army
Major Raymond L. Peacock in Seattle, where he said there has been a
15 percent increase this year in the number of people seeking
assistance.
   A big holiday celebration in a heated tent is planned for the
homeless in front of the U.S. Capitol on Christmas Eve, featuring
entertainers, athletes, gifts for the children, and a special feast.
   But the lack of beds is especially acute in Washington, D.C.,
where, despite the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people living in the
streets, there are only about 2,500 shelter beds, said Maria
Foscarinis, an attorney for the National Coalition for the Homeless.
   The coalition estimates there are as many as 3 million homeless
nationwide.
   ``There are some communities who use our inability to count the
homeless as an excuse not to provide services,'' said Mary Orton,
executive director of Central Arizona Shelter Services in Phoenix,
where estimates range from 6,000 to 9,000.
   ``The simple fact is, regardless of the exact number of people,
they are there and they do need help,'' she said.
   One hard hit city is Oklahoma City, where the number is estimated
at 17,000, according to Christine Byrd, regional director of the
national coalition. She said a December report from a governor's
task force put the total for the state at 35,000.
   Ms. Byrd said 48 percent are families, and that is blamed on
Oklahoma's central location. She said poor families traveling
between the West and East coasts run out of gas or have car trouble
there.
   Ms. Byrd said homelessness in rural areas is increasing because
of farm foreclosures, bank failures, depressed oil and farm
economies. Neither the state or the city provides any aid to the
homeless.
   ``People don't want to accept (a homeless problem exits) because
it is a harsh reality that could happen to them, too,'' said Ms.
Byrd, who works at the Jesus House shelter, which holds 350 people
per night. The rest of those without shelter huddle in groups under
bridges, sleep on sidewalks or stay in abandoned buildings or cars,
she said.
   Baloney Joe's, a Portland shelter for homeless men, is ``so full
we're stacking people on top of each other,'' said Gene Ediger of
the Burnside Community Council, a private agency for the homeless.
He said the number of homeless has gone up 10 to 20 percent each
year this decade.
   ``There's been a steady increase of about 25 percent a year that
hasn't changed in six years,'' said Keith Summa of the Coalition for
the Homeless in New York City.
   In Philadelphia, the city has started daily cleanups of a subway
concourse where homeless people cart cardboard boxes, mattresses and
blankets around Thanksgiving.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode said the cleanup was not an eviction.
Police have not stopped homeless people from returning.
   A few blocks away, a group of homeless people and supporters
Monday erected a ``Disenchanted Village'' of cardboard boxes outside
the federal courthouse, where they said they would stay for the
holidays.
   ``Christmas is a time of enchantment, but not when you're
homeless,'' said Sister Mary Scullion, who runs the Women of Hope
residence for mentally ill homeless women.
   But a Connecticut waitress, Barbara Fox, has seen to it that
homeless children there at least get some gifts. She got the names
and ``wish lists'' of 1,200 homeless children from a state agency
and tied wish cards to Christmas trees in her employer's Saybrook
Fish House restaurants in five cities.
   Within two weeks, the wishes were gone _ some customers grabbing
handfuls of them _ and soon replaced by van-loads of wrapped
packages, Fox said.

   Unexpected thunder and fire shattering
the winter night were the first, vivid impressions of some of the
2,500 inhabitants of the village where Pan Am Flight 103 crashed.
   ``There was a terrible explosion and the whole sky lit up and the
sky was actually raining fire. It was just like liquid,'' said Mike
Carnahan, who was a few hundred yards from wreckage that came down
Wednesday.
   All 258 people aboard the Boeing 747 were killed, and authorities
said there were no survivors in several houses and cars hit by the
wreckage.
   Witnesses said the plane hit a gasoline station in Lockerbie.
   ``All I could see was flames and fire,'' Carnahan told British
Broadcasting Corp. television. ``I could see several houses on the
skyline whose roofs were totally off, and all you could see was
flaming timbers and what was left of the houses.''
   Reporter Ian Fisher of Border TV said: ``The south side of the
town near the main road has been wiped out. Houses are gutted.''
   Sheila McDonald, who was delivering Christmas presents to a
friend's home on a hillside overlooking Lockerbie, told reporters
she heard ``a horrible droning sound''.
   ``This V-shaped object just seemed to come flying through the
air... It was the wings and front section of an aircraft. Another
part came just behind and all around seemed to be red dots like
sparks. It hit some houses in the town and there was a mass of flame
and everything just started to shake.''
   Marian Peel told Independent Radio News: ``I pulled into the
garage and was getting petrol (gasoline) when I heard a rumble that
sounded like thunder. It just got louder and louder and louder.
   ``There was a great big crash and a big burst of fire. Within
seconds there was debris flying all over the place. I just left the
car and ran like hell. I didn't see the plane hit the ground because
the garage has a canopy and it was the other side of the canopy.
   ``There was a lot of fire about and a lot of debris and flames
flying all over the place. The tarmac was on fire... I ran from the
car and there were flames all round the tires.''
   BBC TV reporter Craig Anderson said he saw up to eight houses
demolished and others on fire.
   ``I saw a massive crater 20 feet deep and 100 feet long but
nowhere have I seen any wreckage (from the plane) more than about
three feet across,'' he said.
   He said choking smoke and fumes continued to billow through the
town several hours after the crash.
   Hotelier Graham Byerley told the BBC: ``We initially heard a
rumbling over the hotel. We thought the roof was falling in, and
then we heard a tremendous shudder on the ground as though it were
an earthquake, and then we saw sparks and this enormous flame going
200 or 300 feet into the air.''
   Rescue helicopters flew overhead as firefighters fought the
flames.
   Police and rescue vehicles were held up by traffic as roads
leading to the site became jammed with motorists trying to get a
glimpse of the disaster.
   ``There's a lot of rescue services trying to get to the area but
the roads are blocked solid with cars and sightseers going over
toward the scene of the crash,'' Carnahan said.
   He said he believed the plane was on fire before it crashed
because ``it was trailing flames when it went over the village.''

   An Army lieutenant who missed the plane he
intended to take on his way home for Christmas boarded the Pam Am
jumbo jet that crashed in Scotland, reportedly killing the 258
people aboard, his father said.
   First Lt. George W. Williams, 24, who was stationed near
Frankfurt, West Germany, missed his flight because of a traffic jam,
said the father, George Williams of Joppatowne.
   ``I just talked to him this morning,'' Williams said Wednesday
night. ``Because he missed his flight from Frankfurt ... he had to
make new connections. He told me there was a big backup on the
Autobahn,'' Germany's high-speed highway.
   Williams said his son was coming home for the first time in 16
months.
   The elder Williams and his wife, Judy, waited by the phone in
their suburban Baltimore home until Pan Am officials called them
about 11 p.m. to tell them their son was aboard Flight 103.
   The Boeing 747 plunged to earth in the village of Lockerbie in
southern Scotland. No survivors were found.
   The flight to New York was carrying passengers from Frankfurt and
London.
   The younger Williams had won a full ROTC scholarship after
graduating from Joppatowne High School, and attended Tulane
University. He graduated from Western Maryland College in 1986.
   He was stationed at Bad Kreuznach, where he was a helicopter
forward observer. He was about midway through a three-year tour in
West Germany, his father said.
   ``He enjoyed being in the Army. He enjoyed his time in Germany.
He was doing well,'' and was up for the captain's list next month,
Williams said.

   Lockerbie, the Scottish town ravaged by the crash
of Pan Am Flight 103, is celebrated among fossil hunters for
footprints of dinosaurs.
   The small community in southwest Scotland, 15 miles north of the
English border, is nestled in the middle of the narrow valley of the
Annan River.
   The quarry near Lockerbie that supplies the town's construction
materials is locally famous for the dinosaur footprints.
   Lockerbie was a center for lamb and horse sales in the late 17th
century and lamb sales have been held every year on Lamb Hill since
1680. The town manufactures cheese, cream and woollen goods, and
hosts livestock fairs.
   Its prosperity grew in the 19th century when the railway arrived
from Carlisle in northern England and moved northward to Scotland's
industrial center of Glasgow. The town had railway workshops until
World War I.
   Several of the landowners were connected with the Jardine
Matheson Co., which made a fortune in the China tea trade and
remains one of the major trading companies in Hong Kong.
   Lockerbie, in the regional district of Dumfries and Galloway, was
the scene of savage fighting for generations between the Maxwell and
Johnstone families.
   The Maxwells held the lower end of the Annandale valley and the
Johnstones the center. In 1593, the Johnstones decisively defeated
the Maxwells at Dryfe Sands, killing 700 of them, including their
chief.

   Two judges who let a playboy killer go free
after serving two years for the rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl
were suspended pending an investigation into charges they took a
$200,000 bribe.
   Chief Justice Carlos del Rio Rodriguez told a news conference the
case, which has provoked public outcry, is being investigated ``at
the highest level,'' the government news agency Notimex reported.
   The chief justice suspended Magistrates Gilberto Arredondo Vega
and Eufemio Zamudio Aleman from the bench in Guerrero state Tuesday
pending an inquiry into charges they took a $200,000 bribe for
releasing Alejandro Braun Diaz.
   Braun, a wealthy German-Mexican, went free last week after
serving two years of his 30-year sentence for the rape, torture and
strangulation of Merle Yudiria Mondain.
   The girl was murdered two years ago in the posh resort town of
Acapulco, where Braun's family has a successful cruise business.
   Braun, described by one newspaper as ``The Jackal of Acapulco,''
confessed to keeping the little girl tied to his bed for two days
while he drugged and raped her.
   He and his teenage houseboy, who is still in jail, told the court
they strangled her and dumped the body in a junkyard. The houseboy
testified that Braun, 34, was addicted to drugs and alcohol.
   News that Braun was freed 28 years before the end of his
sentence, the maximum under Mexican law, provoked nationwide outrage.
   Tourists joined locals for protest marches through the streets of
Acapulco and local officials, including the governor of Guerrero,
appealed to the Supreme Court to investigate.
   Gov. Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu praised the decision to suspend
the magistrates, calling such a thing ``unprecedented in Mexican
history.''
   Several news reports said authorities suspect Braun's family
helped him flee the country.

<TEXT>
   Brent Carlsson of Sweden, the U.N. official
who was to guide the African territory of Namibia to independence,
was one of the passengers on the Pan Am jetliner that crashed in
Scotland, officials said.
   All 258 people on board the plane perished in Wednesday's crash.
   Carlsson, 50, was the U.N. commissioner for Namibia, also known
as South-West Africa. He was to have been a witness today for the
signing of an accord granting independence to the territory.
   The United Nations considered Carlsson the chief official of
Namibia, and he planned to guide the transition to an independent
government following signing of the accords allowing for transition
to an independent government.
   The foreign ministers of South Africa, Cuba and Angola are to
sign an accord guaranteeing South Africa will end its 73-year rule
over Namibia, and that 50,000 Cuban troops will withdraw from Angola.
   South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha told The Associated
Press he arrived in New York on the Pan Am flight just before Flight
103.
   Carlsson had been commissioner for Namibia since July 1987. The
United Nations in 1966 revoked a League of Nations mandate giving
South Africa the right to govern Namibia, and asserted its own
authority over the territory.
   South Africa defied the U.N. declaration until this month, when
it signed a preliminary accord under which South Africa will
withdraw from Namibia and Cuba will pull its troops out of the
neighboring Marxist state of Angola.
   The Swedish diplomat faced death more than once. During a trip to
Nicaragua in 1980 he escaped when he canceled a flight following a
tip. A bomb exploded later in the plane, killing four of its
passengers.
   ``People and organizations fighting for freedom and democracy and
against suppression and dictatorships must realize death might be
waiting around the corner,'' he told the Stockholm evening
Aftonbladet in a 1983 interview following the slaying of PLO
official Issam Sartawi in Portugal.
   He earlier acted as a special emissary to the Middle East and
Africa from 1983-85 for Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. From
1976-83, he was general secretary of the Socialist International.
   The diplomat was personal secretary and adviser to the trade
minister from 1967-70, served as an undersecretary of state in
Sweden's Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and was international
secretary of the Swedish Social Democratic Party from 1970-76.
   He traveled and met extensively with leaders in southern Africa
in the course of his duties.
   The United Nations in 1966 revoked a League of Nations mandate
giving South Africa the right to govern Namibia, and asserted its
own authority over the territory.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said today that Moscow does not support local Marxist
rebels and will not seek to ``drive a wedge'' between Manila and the
United States.
   Shevardnadze, the highest-ranking Soviet official ever to visit
this former U.S. colony, also invited President Corazon Aquino to
the Soviet Union before departing for North Korea after a 24-hour
stay.
   Mrs. Aquino said a date for her trip would be set after Foreign
Secretary Raul Manglapus visits Moscow next year.
   During a luncheon meeting with Mrs. Aquino, Shevardnadze said he
had come to the Philippines ``to dispel the myth'' of a Soviet
military buildup in Asia and to stress the need for negotiations
``to sort out our differences.''
   ``We have to take a first step toward building new relationships
in the Asia-Pacific region,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze, who arrived Wednesday from Japan, urged a
conference of Asian foreign ministers to reduce tensions in the
region.
   ``We have absolutely no intention of trying to drive a wedge
between the Philippines and its traditional allies,'' Shevardnadze
added in a reference to the United States.
   During his talks, Shevardnadze avoided detailed discussions on
U.S. military bases in the Philippines. In October, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered to withdraw Kremlin forces from Vietnam
if the Americans close their six bases in this country.
   Shevardnadze told reporters at a departure news conference that
Moscow's view of the U.S. bases ``is negative but, of course, what
happens to the bases is entirely for the government and people of
the Philippines to decide.''
   In October, the United States and the Philippines signed an
agreement allowing Washington to use Subic Bay Naval Base, Clark Air
Base and four smaller installations until 1991 in return for $962
million in economic and military aid over two years.
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesman, Teodoro Benigno, said Shevardnadze told
the president the Soviets would never interfere in internal
Philippine affairs.
   ``The Soviet Union has never supported, nor has any intention of
supporting (the rebels),'' Benigno quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
Later, the Soviet official told reporters: ``I would like to state
in all responsibility, that the Soviet Union is not giving and will
never give support to any insurgent group.''
   The Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines has been waging a
nearly 20-year-old insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   Filipino and Western sources say there is no evidence of Soviet
support to the rebels but that Filipino Communists have been making
overtures to Moscow and other Communist countries.
   Filipino officials praised the Shevardnadze visit and said it
marked a first step in overcoming what Manglapus called ``biases ...
acquired in the early years of the Cold War.''
   The Philippines, which gained independence from the United States
in 1946, has been among the slowest non-communist Southeast Asian
nations to pursue closer ties with the Soviet Union.
   A joint statement said the two sides agreed to expand trade from
$40.4 million last year to $200 million a year in the future.

<HEAD>Spain Signs Agreement For Classic Painting Collection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has signed a 10-year
agreement with one of world's biggest art collectors to bring
paintings by El Greco, Goya and Velazquez home for display.
   The loan agreement with Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza
will bring 787 of the works in his priceless collection of classic
and modern art to Spain, boosting Spain to the rank of one of the
world's leading art centers.
   The acquisition, which Spanish officials hope will become
permament, also includes works by Holbein, Franz Hals, Tintoretto,
Ghirlandaio, Canaletto, Max Beckmann, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Monet and
Degas.
   The agreement signed Tuesday by the baron and Culture Minister
Jorge Semprun caps years of negotiations and represents a success
for Spain over such rival bidders as West Germany, Britain and
Switzerland, and the private Getty Foundation in Malibu, Calif.
   The baron said his desire to have as many people as possible see
his collection ``was probably the most important motive'' in his
decision to bring the works temporarily to Spain.
   ``In doing 10 years, we can see how it works and take a
decision,'' the baron said, referring to the ultimate destination of
his collection. He said the final decision would be up to him, his
wife and his four children.
   Bringing the collection to Spain reportedly is due in large part
to the influence of Carmen ``Tita'' Cervera, a former Miss Spain and
the baron's fifth wife, and to the Duke of Badajoz, Luis
Gomez-Acebo, the husband of King Juan Carlos' sister, Pilar.
   The baron's collection of between 1,200 and 1,600 works, rivaled
only by that of Queen Elizabeth II as the most impressive private
gathering, has been valued at $2 billion. That figure is relatively
meaningless, however, because of the rapidly escalating prices for
in the international art market for both old masters and modern
paintings.
   Most of the paintings to be loaned to Spain will hang in Madrid's
Prado Museum while others, mostly of a religious nature, will hang
in the Pedralbes Monastery in Barcelona.
   Both sites will be renovated to display the collection, now at
the baron's Villa Favorita residence in Lugano, Switzerland.
   Mrs. Thyssen-Bornemizsa said Spanish architects Rafael Moneo,
head of Harvard University's School of Architecture, and Ricardo
Bofill would draw up a design.
   The accord calls for the establishment of a private Thyssen
Foundation with initial funding by the government of $80 million and
annual $5 million compensation payments for the loan of the artworks.
   The paintings will be available for public viewing within 18
months. The government estimates 1 million visitors will see them a
year.
   The agreement says the pieces on loan to Spain can travel freely
to other countries and museums without prior authorization from
Spanish authorities.
   The collection was started by Baron Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza,
the German steel magnate and father of the present baron, who became
a Swiss citizen in 1950.

   In an apparent bid to create a younger,
more reform-minded leadership, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has
overhauled the ruling Politburo and offered the clearest indication
yet that Solidarity may be reinstated.
   At Wednesday's meeting of the Communist Party's governing Central
Committee, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski announced that the
party would reevaluate its attitude toward the outlawed trade union
federation.
   ``We are saying clearly that we desire to discuss the future
model of the trade union movement _ different from the present _
together with the OPZZ (official union movement) and moderate
leaders of former Solidarity,'' he said.
   Reached today at his home in Gdansk, Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa called Rakowski's remarks significant, but said direct talks
with the government were needed to make sure the authorities are
ready to legalize the union movement.
   ``It is a pretty far-reaching statement, and we hope we are
talking about the same thing,'' Walesa said by telephone. ``To see
if it is, we will still have to conduct direct talks. We believe it
is the point, but we want it formulated in a clearer manner.''
   ``It is a signal, but we are saying once again that without
Solidarity, without relegalizing Solidarity there is no possibility
of agreement,'' Walesa said. The movement was crushed by a 1981
military crackdown and outlawed the following year.
   Rakowski told committee members Wednesday to return to local
party units and poll members on the subject of Solidarity and on
Walesa.
   He told them to return to Warsaw in mid-January with their
answers at the 230-member body's next session: ``Your answer ...
will decide about what we will do. And what we do will decide the
future of socialism in Poland.''
   In the leadership shakeup, Jaruzelski removed six hardliners and
veteran members from the Politburo in favor of younger pragmatists.
   Among those promoted to full membership was Stanislaw Ciosek, a
liberal who has been active in conducting talks with Walesa. Ciosek
was also given an important additional post of full party secretary,
where he was expected to assume responsibility for propaganda.
   In all, eight new Politburo members were appointed, increasing
the Politburo's size from 15 to 17 members. Four members of the
Secretariat, responsible for day-to-day operations of the party,
were replaced by new blood.
   The two-day meeting was capped by Jaruzelski's plea to the
opposition to accept the party's offer for talks. He said it appears
Walesa can be trusted to keep a moderate course.
   Referring to the opposition's formation on Sunday of a Citizens
Committee intended to gather mainstream anti-government forces in
one structure under Walesa's leadership, Jaruzelski said:
   ``One can freely create governments in exile or shadow Cabinets
... but the real reconcilation of Poles is the cause of supreme
importance. Our party opts for it decisively and honestly.''
   The newly named Secretariat members were: Ciosek; Zygmunt
Czarzasty, the Slupsk province party chief who developed a
reputation as a strong advocate of pragmatic reforms; Leszek Miller,
a young party chief from Skierniewice province, and Marian Stepien,
a high-ranking party ideologist.
   Among those ousted from the Politburo was Zbigniew Messner,
Rakowski's predecessor as prime minister who resigned in a barrage
of criticism of his handling of the economy.
   Poland is in the throes of an economic crisis and strikes last
summer calling for the Solidarity's reinstatement only aggravated
the situation.
   In an attempt to make the centrally planned economy more
market-oriented, the government raised prices by more than 40
percent early this year. Wages have not kept up.
   New Politburo members were: Ciosek, Gabriela Rebisz, Kazimierz
Cypryniak, Iwona Lubowska, Zdzislaw Swiatek, Viktor Pyrkosz, Janusz
Reykowski and Zbigniew Michalek.
   Jaruzelski had said personnel changes were necessary for the
success of party reforms. At the opening of the meeting Tuesday, he
said the party should be open to unconventional compromises with the
opposition but it must remain Poland's ``key political force.''

   Frankfurt airport officials
stepped up security at Pan Am after receiving tips earlier this
month that a bomb might be smuggled aboard one of the carrier's
jets, the airport's security chief said today.
   The official, Horst Harnstein, said the tips were ``for the
transportation of a bomb from Frankfurt heading in the direction of
the United States.''
   ``There were indications in that direction,'' Harnstein said in a
telephone interview. ``As a result, we stepped up security measures
for Pan Am.''
   ``There were solid indications that it was to be Pan Am,''
Harnstein added. AP. He said authorities first received the tip in
early December, but did not specify the source. Harnstein provided
no further information.
   Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed in pieces into a Scottish
village on Wednesday, originated in Frankfurt aboard a Boeing 727.
The New York-bound Boeing 747 that crashed took off from London.

<HEAD>International Body Says Sabotage Most Likely Explanation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Air Transport Association
believes sabotage is the most likely explanation for the crash of a
Pan Am jumbo jet in Scotland, an association spokesman said today.
   ``We were struck by the similarity of this accident and the Air
India 747 that came down in June 1985'' off the Irish coast after a
bomb exploded that had been put aboard by a terrorist, said David
Kyd, chief public relations officer for the organization.
   ``Sabotage is the most likely explanation,'' he said. ``But of
course, we have to find the black boxes that may or may not give us
additional clues and the fuselage of the aircraft has to be examined
for indications whether there was an explosion on the inside, for
instance, in the cargo hold.''
   He said the sudden loss of contact with the plane and because the
jumbo is known to be very rugged ``it would seem to us that the most
likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard.''
   Kyd said structural problems were unlikely to have been involved
in Wednesday's crash. He noted that previous accidents, such as in
the case of the ill-fated Japanese JAL airliner in 1985, have
demonstrated that 747's can stay aloft for a while even with serious
damage to the structure.
   ``A bulkhead blew out (in the Japanese crash) and they lost the
tail and a rudder but the aircraft was able to continue flying for
over 20 minutes just on the strength of the engines and the pilot's
skill to find some way of getting it down. Ultimately they crashed
into the mountains because they were unable to make it to an
emergency base.''
   Authorities said all 258 people aboard Flight 103 from London to
New York were killed as the 747 plunged in pieces into a Scottish
village. The death toll on the ground was not yet known.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow In The West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snowstorms moved from the Pacific coast across the mountains of
the West today as the rest of the nation enjoyed relatively tranquil
weather.
   A cold front crossing the Rockies today brought 5 to 20 inches of
snow to California's Sierra Nevada. A second storm was expected to
produce heavy snow today and a third may bring more heavy snow this
weekend.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for California's Mount
Shasta, Siskiyou Mountains and northern Sierra Nevada, where 12 to
18 inches of snow were possible, and for higher elevations of
southwestern Oregon.
   A winter storm watch was issued for the southern Sierra Nevada
and for higher elevations of the Lake Tahoe area of Nevada.
   Snow advisories were in effect for California's northwest
mountains, south-central Oregon and parts of Idaho.
   A high surf advisory was posted for the northern coast of
California, where large ocean swells and high tides were expected to
cause dangerous surf conditions the next several days. A gale
warning was in effect for Oregon's coast.
   Snow also fell in sections of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado.
   In Utah, the heavy snow caused hundreds of accidents, but no
serious injuries were reported. Salt Lake City police logged 117
accident reports in 10 hours Wednesday.
   Clouds were over much of the nation east of the Rockies, with fog
in the Southeast. Showers and thunderstorms fell over extreme
southern Florida and rain showers developing along a cold front
moved off the mid-Atlantic Coast.
   Gale warnings were in effect for lakes Erie and Huron tonight.
   Today's forecast called for snow from the eastern Dakotas and
eastern Nebraska to much of the upper Mississippi Valley, northern
Wisconsin and Upper Michigan; rain showers from southeast Minnesota
and southern Wisconsin to the Mississippi and western lower Ohio
valleys; showers and thunderstorms in the lower Mississippi Valley;
and widespread rain along the Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 30s or 40s across much of
the nation; 20s in parts of eastern Idaho, western Montana, western
Wyoming, North Dakota, northern Minnesota, Upper Michigan, and
central New England; 50s and 60s from the central California coast
to the southern Plains, Tennessee Valley and the southern Atlantic
Coast states; 70s in the Gulf Coast; and 80s in the southern half of
Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Limestone, Maine, and Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 71
degrees at Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

   An agreement to dismiss charges against 13
civil rights leaders who tried to halt a City Council meeting is a
step toward resolving a struggle with Toledo over its treatment of
minorities, some black leaders say.
   But if the city does not negotiate in good faith, other civil
rights leaders are warning of more civil disobedience.
   ``The city of Toledo and its government must learn to consult
with us prior to action or there will be continual problems with the
black community,'' said J.B. Simmons, a lawyer for the defendants.
   Mayor Donna Owens called the settlement ``a strong statement that
government will not tolerate people taking over government.''
   The settlement came Wednesday as jury selection for five of the
13 was to resume in Municipal Court.
   The city reduced the charges against the 13 from obstructing
official business charge to failure to disperse. Resisting arrest
charges against two defendants also were dismissed.
   The defendants, who included 12 ministers, pleaded no contest.
Visiting Judge John Patterson dismissed the case and ordered their
records expunged.
   Prosecutor John Madigan said he was not pressured by city
officials to reach a compromise.
   ``Sometimes it takes a court trial to figure out this isn't the
way to go,'' he said.
   The 13 were arrested for trying to stop a June 28 City Council
meeting. They were protesting the firing of a black community
development official, the re-assignment of another black, the
retirement of a third and the resignation of a fourth because of
alleged mismanagement of the housing program.
   Defendant LeRoy Williams, president of the Toledo chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the
agreement was not a retreat.
   ``It is a step forward and another phase in resolving the larger
picture,'' said Williams.
   But another defendant, the Rev. Floyd Rose, a leader of a group
of black ministers known as the Interdenominational Ministerial
Alliance, had doubts about the settlement.
   ``I'm not sure the community will understand now why we did what
we did,'' he said.
   Simmons said city officials agreed to meet with the ministers by
mid-January to try and resolve differences. He said the defendants
agreed to the settlement because it was in the best interest of the
community.
   The mayor said she has been meeting privately with civil rights
leaders to discuss issues facing blacks.
   Ms. Owens, who said she had no part in the plea agreement,
insisted that the city would not be threatened by future acts of
civil disobedience.
   ``I look at it (the agreement) as a strong statement that
government will not tolerate people taking over government, that
there are laws and those laws are to be respected by everybody,''
Ms. Owens said.
   The dispute began over the city's handling of problems in its
Community Development Department. The department's management
shuffle followed an investigation by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development that said the city's housing rehabilitation
program was deficient.
   The civil rights leaders wanted to know why the men were
reprimanded without being consulted about the problems. They also
asked for a hearing into the allegations.
   City officials rejected their requests.

   Church leaders who believe a Dallas judge has been
wrongly criticized for letting his anti-homosexual views influence
his sentencing have pitted themselves against other religious groups
calling for his ouster.
   State District Judge Jack Hampton has already been the subject of
rallies from angry opponents following his disclosure that he gave a
lighter sentence to a murderer partly because his two victims were
homosexuals.
   However, at least seven pastors have agreed to participate in a
rally tonight in support of Hampton, said the Rev. Don Skelton,
pastor at Fountain of The Living Word. He said he expects to draw
about 100 to 150 people.
   ``They're in favor of the stand the judge has taken to sodomy,''
Skelton said. ``We're very much opposed to sodomy. It's against
Texas law for one thing and God's law for another thing.''
   On Wednesday, a coalition of other church leaders, some with
large gay congregations, called on other religious leaders, judges
and lawyers to join them in publicly criticizing Hampton.
   ``We ... deplore the mentality recently expressed by Judge Jack
Hampton in the press, which suggest that all human beings are not of
equal value and are not entitled to equal protection under the
law,'' said the Rev. Howard Tyas, pastor of Bethany Presbyterian
Church, reading from the group's statement at a news conference.
   The church leaders who criticized Hampton said the issue was not
homosexuality or sodomy, but justice.
   ``Every person has a right to equal justice under the law,'' said
the Rev. Lou Arceneaux, pastor at Holy Trinity Catholic Church.
   Hampton's comments in an interview last week in the Dallas Times
Herald prompted the gay community and equal rights activists to seek
his removal from the bench. On Tuesday, elected officials, including
State Treasurer Ann Richards and U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
joined protesters in criticizing Hampton.
   Hampton told the newspaper that he sentenced Richard Lee
Bednarski, 18, to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life
sentence on Nov. 28 in part because the two men Bednarski was
convicted of killing were homosexuals.
   The judge also referred to the two victims as ``queers.''

   A letter to Santa Claus from a 10-year-old boy
who wanted an electric wheelchair for his mother has elicited
Christmas greetings and gifts from around the world _ including one
brand-new wheelchair.
   ``The Christmas spirit is incredible,'' said Denise Reusche, a
clerk at the U.S. Postal Service in Palm Springs, in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   The Postal Service in the desert resort 110 miles east of here
annually processes about 1,000 letters to Santa each year. Normally,
workers send a letter in return.
   But when Ms. Reusche saw John F. Wonggoun's letter from nearby
Banning this year, she decided to do something more for the boy, who
along with his mother was partially disabled in a 1981 traffic
accident.
   His letter read: ``The only gift I would like is an elecric
wheelchair for my mom. She can't walk and her hands are too weak for
the one welfair (sic) gave her 2 years ago. I would love to see her
outside without help and watch me play. Can you help me with my
wish?''
   Ms. Reusche and her fellow workers contacted Fortress Scientific
Co. of Palm Springs, a wheelchair manufacturer, and it donated a
three-wheeled, motorized wheelchair for John's mother, Victoria
Coslett, 39.
   Then the workers bought a bunch of gifts for John, food for
Christmas dinner and established a wheelchair maintenance fund. They
delivered the gifts on Monday.
   Stories about John's letter were distributed worldwide by The
Associated Press.
   Ms. Reusche said in addition to the newspaper stories, the postal
workers were featured on several television and radio interviews.
   ``We had a call from New Zealand for a radio interview. A
Sunnyvale man is sending a letter of encouragement, a train set and
a gift for the mom because he had the same background. A lady in
Connecticut said a group of women was getting together to do
something for John after Christmas was over,'' she said.
   The traffic accident left Ms. Coslett with ruptured spinal discs.
John was partially brain damaged and suffers recurring seizures and
memory lapses. He also has juvenile arthritis.
   Ms. Coslett, in a telephone interview, said she was shocked by
the reaction to her son's letter.
   ``I couldn't speak. All I could do was sit there and cry. He's
done so many things, for me and for the kids out here (in the
apartment complex). If he earns money here and there, he'll go out
and buy a toy for one of the kids. He's never selfish,'' she said.
   ``Nothing has changed. He's floating on a cloud. He's happy the
wheelchair is coming and I can be out there and watch him play,''
she said.

   The second earthquake in Alaska in 27 hours
rocked two fishing villages early today, but there were no reports
of damage or injuries from the strong temblor, officials said.
   The tremor registered about 5.8 on the Richter scale at 1:42 a.m.
AST and was centered beneath the ocean 20 miles northeast of
Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands, said Alec Medbery of the Alaska
Tsunami Warning Center.
   Medbery said the quake jolted Unalaska and neighboring Dutch
Harbor, a major base for fishing vessels, but caused no damage. No
other settlements were close enough to the epicenter to feel the
tremor, he added.
   Late Tuesday, a quake registering 4.3 was centered beneath Kodiak
Island, about 600 miles away.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which each
increase of one number reflects a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage, and 6 can be severe. The quake that devastated San Francisco
in 1906 has been estimated at 8.3.

   Hardly a place in this market town
escaped the crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   The jumbo jet's metal skin and body lay scattered on streets and
sidewalks, and houses bore smoldering testimony to the force of the
explosion when the aircraft slammed in pieces into the village
Wednesday night.
   In the center of this town of 2,500 residents, a complete
aircraft engine lay embedded in a street early today.
   Windows in homes and shops were smashed and searchers crunched
over the broken glass and crumpled bits of metal.
   A row of white houses, only their gabled ends and walls still
standing, smoldered in the early morning darkness.
   Clouds of smoke rose from a huge crater gouged by a chunk of the
crashing plane near the highway at one end of town. A large piece of
fuselage smoldered in the four-lane road. Alongside it was a wrecked
car, almost flattened, one of five hit by the plane.
   Townspeople and rescue workers combed the area for bodies, and
carried the victims into a makeshift mortuary in the town hall.
Residents anxious for news about friends and relatives were allowed
inside the sandstone building to check the lists of survivors from
the most badly-affected streets.
   Earlier, stunned villagers stood in small knots watching the
police, firefighters, soldiers and ambulances go back and forth.
Rescue workers flinched as a chimney suddenly crashed to the ground.
   ``It seems almost incongruous that in this quiet and peaceful
place this awful thing has happened,'' said Donald Dewar, the
opposition Labor Party's spokesman on Scottish affairs.
   Survivors were being housed with friends in the tightly-knit
community and the town hall noticeboard was serving as a bulletin
board for the whereabouts of the evacuees.
   ``The worst thing is the uncertainty,'' said a woman shopkeeper
who would not give her name. ``We know there were a lot of people on
the plane but where are the local people?
   ``This a close community and we still just don't know who might
be alive or dead.''
   Scott Maxwell and a neighbor had rushed to a garage devastated by
the blast and helped injured people get clear of the scene. With
telephones knocked out, he used the radio in his van to call
emergency services, and then helped clear debris from the roads to
enable emergency vehicles to get through.
   Bungalows in Sherwood Crescent and Sherwood Park appeared to have
caught the full force of the crash, and police said no one inside
the struck houses had survived.
   Broken roof tiles and pieces of metal, probably from the
aircraft, lay everywhere and houses that were not hit were evacuated
in case of gas leaks.
   Three miles east of Lockerbie, the cockpit of the aircraft lay
almost intact on Banks Hill. It was about 50 feet from the road near
a church, with bodies scattered nearby.
   Barely 15 miles from the English border, Lockerbie is set in the
middle of Annandale, the narrow valley of the Annan River.
   The quarry near Lockerbie is celebrated among fossil hunters for
footprints of dinosaurs.
   The village's people manufacture cheese and cream and woollen
goods and hold popular livestock fairs.

<HEAD>Discover of Biorhythms Dies at 94</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Curt Paul Richter, credited with discovering
the biorhythms that regulate sleep and other basic body functions,
died of natural causes at age 94.
   Richter, a professor emeritus of psychobiology at Johns Hopkins
Medical Institutions, died Wednesday at a retirement community here,
said Hopkins spokesman Phil Kibak.
   Richter demonstrated during more than 50 years of research on
animals and humans that some behavior is driven by internal
mechanisms operating in predictable cycles, said Dr. Paul McHugh,
director of the department of psychiatry and behavioral science at
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
   Richter determined that such drives as hunger, sleep, thirst and
the need for particular nutrients were part of the body's mechanisms
and he discerned that those mechanisms were driven by portions of
the brain.
   His work evolved into the study of biorhythms, or the cyclical
nature of the body in controlling basic body functions, such as
sleep.
   ``Before Richter's work, everyone agreed that the body was driven
by instincts, but lacked a sense of how to investigate the body in
that regard,'' McHugh said.
   Richter's 1927 paper on animal behavior and the internal
mechanisms that drive their behavior is widely regarded as the
primer that spurred modern research on how behavior affects health.
   Richter is also credited with discovering that behavior will
automatically seek to keep the body nutritionally balanced.
   In a series of what became known as the ``cafeteria
experiments,'' Richter deprived mice of particular nutrients, such
as potassium and salt. He then set before the animals various foods,
and found that the mice ate the particular foods that offered high
concentrations of nutrients their bodies lacked, McHugh said.
   ``He demonstrated the wisdom of the body expressed in behavior,''
McHugh said.
   The Denver native earned an undergraduate degree in 1917 from
Harvard University and a doctorate from Johns Hopkins in 1921.
   Richter served as director of the psychobiology laboratory in the
Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1922
until 1957, when he was appointed professor of psychobiology at
Hopkins medical institutions.
   After retiring in 1960, he continued to work in his laboratory
until this year.
   He wrote more than 250 research papers and received honorary
degrees from the University of Chicago, Hopkins and the University
of Pennsylvania.
   He also was the recipient in 1977 of the prestigious Passano
Award, given each year to those who make outstanding contributions
to the advancement of medical science.
   ``He was a great natural scientist who would get simple
experiments out of looking at the behavior of animals, and those
simple experiments illuminated for us the biological control of the
instincts,'' McHugh said.
   Richter is survived by his wife, a son and two daughters.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Friday.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady in Lethargic Trading, Gold Mostly Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was holding steady in thin, lethargic
trading in Europe late this morning, with dealers in lightly staffed
trading rooms expecting little significant change in the currency
through the session.
   Gold prices were mostly higher.
   ``The market is absolutely dead this morning,'' said one foreign
exchange trader a major U.S. bank in Milan.
   She added that there also were very few commercial orders,
further reducing activity.
   ``There's not even any hard news to trade on,'' the trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 124.62 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 124.73 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7732 West German marks, up from 1.7720
   _1.4963 Swiss francs, down from 1.4980
   _6.0550 French francs, up from 6.0500
   _2.0025 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9920
   _1,305.75 Italian lire, up from 1,302.00
   _1.1995 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2012
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8040, compared with
$1.8065 Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $414.30 a troy ounce,
down from $415.75 bid late Wednesday. But at midmorning today, the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price
of $415.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $415.40, up from $414.60 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.51 to close at a bid $417.45.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.12 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $6.14.

<TEXT>
   A thief who swiped a car from a driveway got a
bonus of enough home-made cookies for a Texas-size Christmas party,
but the sweets may not be worth it since they were intended for the
sheriff's department.
   Cynthia Gammill said there were 224 dozen cookies in the trunk of
her stolen car. They were baked by members of the First United
Methodist Church of Dallas for members of the Dallas County
sheriff's office who have to work Christmas.
   When the women found out there would be 600 people working on the
holiday, they began baking the 2,688 cookies right after
Thanksgiving.
   Sheriff's department spokesman Jim Ewell said he hopes the
thieves will discover the cookies and realize they were destined for
lawmen and abandon the car because ``they don't want to deal with
it.''
   The women are back to their ovens.
   ``They all said they are willing to bake another two dozen by
Friday,'' Ms. Gammill said.

   Here are some facts and figures on Namibia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Namibia covers 318,261 square miles, stretching
between the Orange River on the South African border northward 780
miles to the Cunene River on the Angolan border. To the east is
Botswana. To the west is the South Atlantic. The Namib desert runs
along the entire seaboard, and the southern two-thirds of the
country receives little rain.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ One of the world's most sparsely populated areas,
Namibia has an estimated 1.3 million people occupying territory as
large as France and West Germany combined. There are 11 main ethnic
groups, including two mixed-race groups, eight black groups and
about 75,000 whites. The Ovambo people, who inhabit the relatively
fertile northern region, make up about half the population.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ The economy is dominated by mining, which generates
about one-fourth of the gross domestic product. The principal
minerals are diamonds, uranium and copper. There is little
commercial farming, other than livestock ranching, and foreign
countries have depleted fishing grounds off the coast. The
manufacturing sector is very small. The only deep-water port is
Walvis Bay, a South African enclave that South African officials say
will not be yielded to an independent Namibian government.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   POLITICS _ The U.N. independence plan for Namibia calls for a
seven-month transition period leading to elections for a national
assembly on Nov. 1. The South-West African People's Organization,
which has waged a low-level guerrilla war against South African rule
since 1966, is favored to win the election. It is expected to be
opposed by a coalition of white and black parties which have
participated in an interim administration installed by South Africa
in 1985.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Primitive people first came to Namibia 2,000 years ago.
Portuguese navigators reached the coast in the early 15th century,
and Dutch and British captains laid claim to parts of the coast in
the late 1700s. The Ovambo and Herero tribes migrated from
present-day Zaire to Namibia in the early 19th century, followed by
English and German missionaries. Britain annexed Walvis Bay in 1978.
In 1884, Germany proclaimed a protectorate over the area. The
discovery of diamonds in 1908 brought an influx of Europeans. South
Africa occupied the territory during World War I and began to
administer it in 1920 under a mandate from the League of Nations.
The league's successor body, the United Nations, revoked the mandate
in 1966, called for an end to South African rule and declared SWAPO
the legitimate representative of the Namibian people. Negotiations
aimed at bringing about independence have been under way for more
than a decade.

<HEAD>U.S. Congressmen Protest Darkie Toothpaste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six U.S. congressmen accused a Taiwan
company of perpetuating racial stereotypes by marketing a locally
produced toothpaste named ``Darkie,'' the American Institute in
Taiwan said today.
   In a news release, the institute said the congressmen, citing the
toothpaste as an example, told Taiwan's authorities and business
community that ``xenophobia and racism'' would never be tolerated.
   The institute is the unofficial U.S. representative office in
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations.
   The statement, initiated by Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., was
issued two days after the six-member Congressional Government
Operations Committee left for home following a three-day visit to
Taiwan.
   The other representatives were Texas Democrats Jack Brooks and
Ron Coleman, Robert Wise, a Democrat from West Virginia, Edolphus
Towns, a Democrat from New York, and Donald Lukens, a Republican
from Ohio.
   ``Darkie'' toothpaste is one of many examples of racism in
consumer products in Asia, the statement said, adding that
governments in Asian countries should stop such racial stereotypes.
   ``If they want strong relations with the United States, they
should understand this,'' it added.
   The yellow package of the toothpaste bears the English word
``Darkie'' and a Chinese equivalent, as well as a drawing of a
grinning black minstrel.
   Last year, after several American groups said the name was
offensive, the government's Tourism Bureau sent a letter to travel
agents advising the public not to carry that brand of toothpaste
abroad.
   The manufacturer, Hawley and Hazel, says it does not plan to
change the name because the popular toothpaste has been known to
local users since 1937 and is not for export.
   The manufacturer is a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Hawley
and Hazel Chemical Corp., partially owned by Colgate Palmolive Co.

<HEAD>Robbers Hold Bank Official's Family Hostage, Escape With $250,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three robbers held a bank executive
and his family hostage overnight, then stole nearly $250,000 from
the bank's vaults before fleeing, authorities said.
   Police were not notified for 90 minutes until the robbers had
fled and BankAtlantic Chief Executive Officer Alan Levan found his
wife and 7-year-old daughter locked in the trunk of their
Mercedes-Benz, police spokesman Ott Cefkin said Wednesday.
   ``It seems to be very well planned, and obviously it worked very
well,'' Cefkin said. ``They were probably halfway to Mexico by
then.''
   Three men posing as a flower delivery team gained access to
Levan's Coral Gables home Tuesday evening while Levan, 40, and his
wife, Susan, 38, were out.
   The intruders held the live-in maid, Petrona Sandoval, 68, and
the Levans' daughter, Lauren, at gunpoint until the couple arrived
home shortly after midnight.
   ``They opened the door and the people were there at gunpoint,''
Bank executive Mark Wright said.
   The family was held overnight in an upstairs bedroom, then driven
30 miles north to Fort Lauderdale during morning rush-hour. Sandoval
was left behind handcuffed inside a bedroom and Levan's wife and
daughter were locked in the car's trunk during the trip.
   When Levan arrived at the bank he and Wright packed the money
into a suitcase, said Barry Deutsch, the bank's executive vice
president.
   ``This was not in the context of your normal robbery,'' he said.
``They walked in calmly. Noboby else knew what was going on.''
   Levan said the robbers, who left in his car, told him not to call
police until they called with the location of the Mercedes.
   ``I don't mean to trivialize money, but money is money,'' Deutsch
said. ``It's not the same as people. We're family here. We're just
glad everyone is safe.''

<TEXT>
   The 35 nations at the Helsinki conference
on European security and cooperation are close to a final accord and
should wrap up more than two years of tough bargaining with a
meeting of foreign ministers in Vienna Jan. 17-19, diplomats said
today.
   An East-West dispute over a proposed human rights conference in
Moscow is one of the few outstanding issues to be resolved in
late-night bargaining by diplomats who will work through Christmas
and New Year's in a dash to get agreement before President Reagan
leaves office Jan. 20.
   Diplomats say the accord would be a landmark achievement breaking
new ground in committing the Soviet bloc to many new provisions on
human rights, affecting citizens rights to travel, practice religion
and communicate freely.
   The conference, which involves the Soviet Union, United States,
Canada and all European nations except Albania, also would sign a
mandate for new East-West talks on reducing conventional forces in
Europe.
   U.S. Ambassador Warren Zimmermann said today that one American
disappointment was the failure to secure the right of free
emigration for Soviet bloc citizens.
   But the Soviet Union has announced it will adopt new laws on
secrecy that advise citizens taking sensitive jobs that this will
prevent them from leaving the country for a certain number of years
after they cease that work.
   Britain, the United States and Canada are among the Western
delegations that have made the strongest demands on human rights at
the conference, which opened in November 1986.
   Diplomats who insisted on anonymity indicated that top-level
talks are going on now in Western capitals to determine whether the
West will agree to a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991.
   The United States and other nations have pressed for the release
of all political prisoners before agreeing to a Moscow conference.
   Zimmermann said the Soviet Union has made significant progress in
recent weeks, but there are still ``gray areas.''
   The West considers as political prisoners some patients in
psychiatric hospitals or prisoners in labor camps sentenced on
``trumped-up'' charges, Zimmermann said.
   In some cases, the Soviet Union has argued those people are
mentally insane or jailed on criminal charges, Zimmermann said. In
others, Moscow reports it has no trace of people the West lists as
political prisoners, he said.
   Diplomats from Western, Soviet bloc and neutral nations at the
conference said other outstanding issues beside the Moscow
conference include:
   _A Western request for a lasting Soviet bloc commitment to end
jamming of all Western radio stations. Bulgaria, the last Soviet
bloc nation still jamming Radio Free Europe, is expected to lift
jamming this week, according to an informed source who demanded
anonymity.
   _The right of Soviet bloc citizens to monitor their nations'
compliance with the 1975 Helsinki Final Act and subsequent
agreements by the 35 signatories to that accord.
   _Adoption of a ``code of good conduct'' listing conditions such
as free access which countries hoping to hold follow-up conferences
must meet. Zimmermann said the United States will insist on such an
agreement.
   At a news conference, Zimmermann refused to say the Vienna
meeting would wind up before Reagan leaves office.
   But Torovsky told a separate news conference that Austrian
Foreign Minister Alois Mock invited the foreign ministers of the 35
participating nations to a final meeting Jan. 17-19 in Vienna.
   Torovsky said he was confident the 12 neutral and non-aligned
nations charged with finding compromise formulas acceptable to both
East and West would wrap up a draft final agreement next week or at
the latest in early January.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli soldier who was critically injured
when he tried to rescue a woman from a passenger bus that was
firebombed in the West Bank died today in a London hospital, the
army said.
   Also today, troops shot and wounded 13 Palestinians in sporadic
clashes in the occupied territories, Arab hospital officials and
reporters said.
   Military spokesmen said they could not immediately confirm the
casualties in today's violence and were checking the reports.
   The soldier's death raised to 14 the number of Israelis who have
died in the yearlong Palestinian revolt against Israeli occupation
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 333 Palestinians have died.
   The army identified the soldier as 19-year-old David Deloroza of
Jerusalem. He was transferred to a London hospital for an operation
to replace his heart and lungs, which were severely damaged from
smoke inhalation during the firebomb attack near the city of Jericho.
   Palestinian guerrillas hurled the bombs at the Israeli bus on
Oct. 31. Deloroza tried to save Rachel Weiss, an Israeli woman who
refused to leave the burning bus without her children. She and the
three children burned to death.
   In Bethlehem, activists belonging to a Palestinian Communist
faction today painted slogans on the walls in red warning Christians
to abide by a general strike called for Christmas Eve.
   ``Remain home on Dec. 24,'' one slogan read.
   ``No Christmas celebrations .... Only prayers,'' said another.
   In the West Bank's largest city of Nablus, Palestinian protesters
took to the streets after a curfew was lifted early today. Five
people were wounded in clashes with troops, including a 42-year-old
woman shot in the arm, local reporters and hospital officials said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, seven Palestinians were shot and
wounded, including a 9-year-old boy shot in the abdomen, Arab
doctors said.
   Also today, one man was shot and wounded in the southern West
Bank city of Hebron, hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Woman Given Stiffest Sentence Ever For Tax Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who, with her husband, hid $1
million worth of valuables in three states after the couple was
charged with tax evasion has been sentenced to 30 years in prison
and fined $960,000.
   U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple, imposing what was believed to
be the stiffest sentence ever in a U.S. tax case, rejected the
results of a psychiatric examination that concluded Trula Walker
could be manipulated by male figures in her life. The exam had been
done at Mrs. Walker's request.
   Mrs. Walker, 47, also was ordered Wednesday to make restitution
to the employees of Campbell 66, a family trucking company that
prosecutors said the Walkers milked into bankruptcy by skimming
profits to avoid taxes. Her father, Frank Campbell, founded the
company that once operated in 13 states.
   A U.S. District Court jury in August found Mrs. Walker guilty of
five counts of tax evasion and one count of conspiracy.
   Mrs. Walker's husband, Randall, earlier was sentenced to 20 years
in prison and fined $980,000. At the time, U.S. Attorney Robert
Ulrich called it the stiffest sentence in a tax case, noting that Al
Capone got only 13 years.
   The Walkers were charged with conspiring to appropriate funds
from the trucking company for their personal use. The money taken
was not reported to the Internal Revenue Service as income.
   Walker pleaded guilty to conspiracy and tax fraud charges Aug. 2.
The IRS then began finding jewelry, furniture and cash at sites in
Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Some of the valuables were buried
in chicken coops or hidden in trailer trucks.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Jones said the value of the
recovered assets was about $1 million.

   Four teen-agers who watched a driver fall
unconscious and crash into a cemetery have been arrested on charges
they looted her car and stole the engagement ring off her finger,
police said.
   The 24-year-old woman swerved off the road Tuesday night after
apparently suffering an epileptic seizure, said Murray Assistant
Police Chief Paul Forbes.
   As she lay unconscious in her car, four young men who had been
driving behind her stopped and stole her purse and the ring off her
finger, police said.
   The teens, ages 16, 17, 18 and 19, were arrested after a witness
gave police a description of their vehicle.
   The two adults were booked into the Salt Lake County jail for

   A senior official of the Palestine Liberation
Organization today said it was ``nonsensical'' to link Palestinians
to the Pan Am airliner crash in Scotland.
   ``It cannot possibly occur to the Palestinians or the Arabs to
commit such an act,'' Mahmoud Abbas, code-named Abu-Mazen, told
reporters when asked about reports that the plane may have been
downed by sabotage. ``Any attempts to draw the Arabs into this are
nonsensical.''
   The crash Wednesday night of the Boeing 747 en route from London
to New York killed all 258 people on board and a number of villagers
in Lockerbie, Scotland where it crashed. U.S. and British officials
said the plane probably exploded in midair before the crash.
   Abbas is a member of the 15-man PLO Executive Committee chaired
by Yasser Arafat. He spoke after meeting with Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid.
   In Washington, a U.S. government source said the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki, Finland, received a telephone threat about two weeks ago
from a person claiming to belong to the Abu Nidal group, a radical
Palestinian faction that has been implicated in terrorist attacks.
   The caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a Pan Am plane and
that it would be carried by a woman, said the government source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Arafat publicly renounced terrorism last week and accepted other
U.S. conditions, leading Washington to open a dialogue with the PLO
after a 13-year ban on contacts with the group.

<HEAD>World's Richest Lottery Showers Millions On Spaniards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's richest lottery showered
Christmas cheer and billions of tax-free pesetas on jubilant
Spaniards as the annual Yuletide tradition paid out prize money
equivalent to $734 million.
   A crowd in a Madrid auditorium roared as two boys from an
orphanage sang out the number of the first prize popularly called
``El Gordo,'' (``the fat one''), a total of $159 million to 72
ticket-holders throughout Spain.
   Two hours and 45 minutes after the drawing began, the ball
bearing the winning number rolled out of the chute as millions of
Spaniards gathered in front of televisions and radios for the live
morning broadcast of the Christmas lottery begun in 1818.
   The ceremony is more popular than Santa Claus in Spain.
   Today's prizes were the richest since King Carlos III established
Spain's first lottery in 1763.
   To cope with demand this year, the state-run lottery issued 72
tickets for each of the 66,000 lottery numbers.
   Thirty percent of the lottery proceeds go straight into state
coffers. The prize money is tax-free.
   The second prize of $1 million went to each of the 72 holders of
a number bought largely by youths belonging to a soccer club in
Alcala de Henares, the birthplace of Miguel de Cervantes just east
of the Spanish capital.
   Officers and soldiers in the military government building in the
southeastern city of Valencia broke out champagne upon the
announcement of the third prize number, which paid out $526,315 to
its 72 winners. Members of an army infantry division based in
Valencia purchased most of that number.

   The state Supreme Court has been asked to
remove a judge from office for making sexual advances to female
defendants.
   The state Judicial Tenure Commission said in a decision released
Wednesday that Kalamazoo District Judge Arvin Davis was guilty of
misconduct in office and should be barred for life from the
judiciary because he was morally unfit and had damaged the image of
the courts. The final decision rests with the state Supreme Court.
   ``Public perception of our judicial system is directly affected
by such conduct which prejudices more than just (Davis') ability to
administer justice,'' the decision said.
   The 8-0 decision said Davis had shown he lacked moral character
needed by a judge.
   Davis, 50, declined to comment, saying, ``Any comment should come
from my attorney.'' His attorney, William Fette, did not return
phone calls made to his office Wednesday.
   The recommendation from the commission, which polices judicial
conduct, was the stiffest penalty it could suggest to the state
Supreme Court.
   The commission's order said testimony taken during a hearing on
the complaint against Davis indicated the judge had met privately
with three female defendants, asking them questions about their
sexual activity and the color of their undergarments. One said he
squeezed and fondled her.
   A court employee also testified Davis made suggestive comments to
her at a 1986 Christmas party.
   The commission rejected Davis' defense that the comment to the
court employee was intended as a joke and that he had met privately
with defendants in efforts to help them.
   Supreme Court spokesman Tom Farrell said the commission must file
its report with the court within 21 days. Davis then has 28 days to
ask for a modification or seek oral arguments before the court.
   Davis, who has been a judge since 1982, has not been on the bench
since May pending the outcome of the case but has continued to
receive his $88,000-a-year salary.

<TEXT>
   A 105-acre ranch worth nearly $500,000 and
located near President Reagan's own ranch was seized by federal
agents after a marijuana crop was found there.
   The property, located at the exclusive Hollister Ranch
development in this Santa Barbara County community, was the 34th
seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration this year in Southern
California, said DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge.
   Federal agents discovered 65 well-cultivated marijuana plants at
the ranch, located about 15 miles from the ranch owned by the
president, authorities said.
   ``This is part of an aggressive approach by federal and local
authorities to use the federal forfeiture law to confiscate and
forfeit the assets of drug traffickers,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert
C. Bonner.
   The ranch, seized by DEA agents, working with federal marshals
and county sheriff's deputies Wednesday, was valued at $475,000,
said Mary McMenimen, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office.
   The plants, valued at $227,500, were discovered Sept. 15 when
authorities flying over the area spotted a bright patch of green,
Ms. McMenimen said.
   They were about 200 yards from the house and were irrigated from
the residence, she said.
   The property is owned by Thomas Winfield III, Sandra J. Winfield,
Dianne L. Vanderhave and Peter J. Vanderhave, Ms. McMenimen said.
   The Vanderhaves were arrested in the raid Sept. 15 and charged
with felony marijuana cultivation, said sheriff's Lt. William Lenvik.
   No information was available about the Winfields. Ms. McMenimen
said she was unaware if charges had been filed against them.

   Israel's two largest political blocs today
joined forces in another coalition government, and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir called the move necessary to withstand world pressure
to accept a Palestinian state.
   Shamir also called on the United States to reverse its recent
decision to hold talks with the PLO, which Israel considers a
terrorist organization.
   The agreement between Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-leaning Labor Party headed by Shimon Peres comes more than
seven weeks after deadlocked general elections Nov. 1.
   The new 28-member Cabinet took office after the 120-member
Knesset, the parliament, approved the coalition in a vote of
confidence by 84-19 margin with three abstentions. Fourteen
legislators were absent or did not vote.
   ``The developments in the international arena ... require us to
bridge our differences and solve problems together,'' Shamir told
the legislature.
   ``I make specific reference to the multifaceted political
propaganda campaign of the terrorist organizations, their friends
and supporters against Israel,'' Shamir said, referring to the PLO.
   Shamir also said the new government would stick by its policy of
refusing contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``Unfortunately we have been forced to strongly differ from the
last decision of the U.S. administration concerning the dialogue
with the PLO,'' Shamir said.
   ``According to our knowledge, it (the PLO) has not changed its
skin, its habits, its evil charter and the terror that it uses,''
Shamir added. ``We still hope the United States will reconsider its
decision concerning the PLO.''
   Shamir spoke after Likud and Labor signed a nine-page coalition
agreement at a brief ceremony at which ministers also drank a toast
of ``L'Chaim,'' the traditional Jewish toast meaning ``to life.''
   The policy guidelines and distribution of Cabinet posts differed
little from that of the outgoing Labor-Likud coalition formed after
indecisive elections in 1984.
   Shamir, who will serve as prime minister for the next four years,
said he would immediately launch a peace offensive, but his proposal
appeared no different from previous plans rejected by Israel's Arab
neighbors.
   Shamir said he could have formed a narrow coalition government
with small religious and right-wing parties but preferred to share
power with Labor to withstand growing international pressure on
Israel to negotiate with the PLO and accept a Palestinian state.
   ``We must unify all the nation's political forces to build a
national unity government to repel these dangers,'' Shamir said.
   He also called on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip to end their yearlong uprising against Israeli occupation, in
which more than 330 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died.
   At this point, his speech was interrupted by shouts from two
left-wing Arab legislators who support negotiations with the PLO.
   Peres noted ideological differences between Likud and Labor,
which favors an international conference and the return of occupied
territory in exchange for peace.
   ``We have two views, but one country and one future,'' said
Peres, who was foreign minister in the outgoing government, and now
will become finance minister. ``We will try with our two views to
serve the same country and the same future.''
   The Cabinet consists of 28 ministers, 11 from Labor, 11 from
Likud and others from three small religious parties _ the National
Religious Party, Shau and Agudat I{raev
   In addition to Shamir as prime minister and Peres as finance
minister, the top posts went to Shamir confidant Moshe Arens who was
named foreign minister and Labor's No. 2, Yitzhak Rabin, who
retained his post as defense minister.
   Elements in both Labor and Likud opposed another coalition
government, but both parties approved the agreement Wednesday.
   In the Nov. 1 balloting, Likud gained a slight edge, winning 40
seats in the 120-member Knesset to Labor's 39. The rest of the votes
were split among smaller parties, making some form of coalition
necessary.
   But political commentators were skeptical that the new government
could operate effectively and predicted the same type of paralysis
that plagued the outgoing coalition, especially on peace issues.
   Shamir and Peres ``will go forward like two convicts in
leg-irons, hobbling painfully,'' said a front-page editorial in the
Jerusalem Post newspaper. ``And if hobbling proves too painful, they
will just stand still.''

<HEAD>General's Complaints Bring Changes In Andrews Flight Patterns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aircraft using this base in
the suburbs of the nation's capital have changed their flight
patterns, after a general living at the facility complained of the
noise.
   Col. William Phillips, commander of the 1776th Air Base Wing,
apologized in writing to Gen. Bernard Randolph, a four-star general
who heads the Air Force Systems Command which has its headquarters
at Andrews.
   Randolph's Belle Chance mansion is just 1,200 feet from a main
runway.
   Randolph's complaint stemmed from a Sept. 12 incident in which an
air traffic controller directed a C-141 to change its path for
safety reasons because it was on a crash course with an approaching
F-4 fighter.
   Base spokeswoman Maj. Val Elbow explained Wednesday that the
C-141 banked sharply over Randolph's house, drawing the general's
concern for the safety of those below.
   ``I apologize that we appear to have ignored your request to
reduce noise when possible in the vicinity of Belle Chance,''
Phillips wrote to Randolph. ``I talked to each of our flying unit
commanders personally and requested they emphasize the location of
Belle Chance to their air crews.''
   Phillips also said most flights on the Belle Chance side of the
runway will not be allowed.
   The noise abatement policy has been in effect for years, but
pilots didn't receive special notices to follow the rules until
after Randolph's complaint, The Washington Times reported Thursday.
   Maj. Elbow said the matter could have been smoothed over if
Phillips' letter had focused on the safety issues.
   ``It's not realistic not to expect noise'' at an Air Force base,
she said.

<HEAD>India, China Agree To Set Up Group To Discuss Border Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China and India have agreed to establish a group
to take up their thorny border dispute following discussions with
visiting Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, the Foreign Ministry
announced today.
   Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, speaking at the end of Gandhi's
visit to the Chinese capital, also said good will fostered by the
trip could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the near
future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit China since
his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954, left Beijing for the
ancient capital of Xian this afternoon following three days of talks
with China's top leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph and declared that the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute, which exploded into a short war in 1962 and
since has poisoned relations between the world's two most populous
nations, was the most pressing topic in Gandhi's talks with Premier
Li Peng and other senior leaders.
   Spokesman Li, speaking at a news conference, said:
   ``Thanks to the visit, the Sino-Indian history of relations now
ushers in a new period. Leaders of the two countries conducted
sincere and in-depth discussions on the border question between
China and India, which are conducive to reaching a solution on the
boundary question in the near future.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister-level
and will be like a joint commission.
   China and India have held eight rounds of talks in the past seven
years on the border, but there has been no formal structure to the
meetings, which have achieved little or no progress.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   Gandhi and the Chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the
boundary question. ``The border issue is very complicated,'' Gandhi
said at a Wednesday news conference. ``We can't expect instant
solutions.''
   The symbolic restoration of friendly ties dominated the Gandhi
trip, although the two sides added some substance today by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for direct flights between New
Delhi and Beijing and two other accords.
   The two sides also signed a three-year cultural exchange
agreement and a science and technology accord promoting contacts
between their scientific communities.
   Gandhi also is to tour Shanghai before returning to New Delhi on
Friday. The two sides are to issue a joint communique when he
departs.

   A bomb planted at the University of
Connecticut's social sciences building was disarmed today after a
janitor discovered it in a floor ashtray, a university spokeswoman
said.
   The janitor, who was not identified, became suspicious on
noticing a device with wires sticking out of it in the ashtray. He
took it outside and summoned campus police, said spokeswoman Karen
Grava Williams.
   They in turn called the state police bomb squad, which took the
bomb to a dump about a mile away and disarmed it, Williams said. It
did not explode and no one was hurt, she said.
   ``It is an explosive device; it will not detonate now,'' she
said. ``They are planning on examining it as best they can to use it
as evidence.''
   Monteith Hall, where the device was found, and another nearby
building, the Arjona humanities building, were to be closed the rest
of the day while police used bomb-sniffing dogs to make sure there
are no other bombs in either building, Williams said.
   No one claimed responsibility for planting the device and
university officials have no reason to believe other bombs will be
found, she said.
   ``We want to take every precautionary measure to be sure there
are not and that includes keeping students out of the building,''
she said.
   Classes ended for the semester last week but a number of students
are still on campus for final exams, which run through Friday,
Williams said. A number of exams were scheduled for Monteith Hall
today, she said.

<TEXT>
   A Pan Am jumbo jet apparently exploded
in the air before crashing and killing all 259 people aboard, and
investigators focused today on terrorist threats to place a bomb on
a Pan Am airliner.
   The wreckage of the Boeing 747 bound for New York with Christmas
travelers scattered bodies and wreckage over the countryside and
ravaged the village of Lockerbie.
   Twenty-two people died on the ground, most of them in cars hit by
wreckage, Desmond Park, deputy chief executive of the area's local
council, told the Dumfriesshire newspapers group.
   The plane smashed into the ground, destroying 40 houses,
triggering an explosion at a gas station and engulfing cars in
flames.
   The death toll on the plane rose to 259 today when it was
discovered that another flight attendant was on board, said Pamela
Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman in New York. The victims included U.S.
servicemen, 38 students from Syracuse University and an Associated
Press executive and five of his family members.
   Neither Scottish Secretary Malcom Rifkind, the chief British
official at the site, nor U.S. Ambassador Charles Price would
speculate on the possibility of sabotage, but both the International
Air Transport Association and the British Airline Pilots Association
said that was the most likely explanation.
   In Washington, a U.S. government source said the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki, Finland, received a telephone threat about two weeks ago
from a person claiming to belong to the Abu Nidal group, a radical
Palestinian faction that has been implicated in terrorist attacks.
   The caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a Pan Am plane and
that it would be carried by a woman, said the government source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The government source said that threat was the basis for posting
notices at U.S. embassies.
   In Moscow, the U.S. Embassy last week warned American diplomats
that a bomb threat had been made against a Pan Am flight flying from
Frankfurt, West Germany to the United States sometime in December.
The warning left it to the diplomats' discretion whether to change
travel plans.
   The doomed Pan Am Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt aboard a
different aircraft.
   In Frankfurt, the airport security chief said officials stepped
up security at Pan Am after receiving threats against the carrier
earlier this month.
   An anonymous male caller to The Associated Press in London
claimed responsibility for the disaster and said it was in
retaliation for the shooting down of an Iran Air Airbus by the U.S.
Navy cruiser Vincennes in July. The Navy said the plane carrying 290
people over the Persian Gulf had been mistaken for an Iranian
fighter. At the time, some Islamic extremists vowed revenge, but
later Iranian officials said they understood the attack was a
mistake.
   ``We the guardians of the Islamic revolution are undertaking this
heroic execution in revenge of blowing the Iran air plane by America
a few months ago and keeping the Shah's family in America. We are
very proud,'' the caller said, then hung up quickly.
   The group also claimed responsibility for a July 18, 1987, car
bombing in London that wounded Amir Hussein Amir-Parviz, chairman of
National Movement for Iranian resistance and a former Iranian
cabinet minister under the Shah.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon told the House of Commons that
searchers had recovered both the airplane's flight recorders, the
vital electronic devices which monitor all flight data and
conversation by the pilots.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prince Andrew, the Duke of
York, visited Lockerbie and talked to rescuers.
   Rifkind, the British Cabinet minister responsible for Scotland,
said the widespread wreckage of the plane indicated ``the aircraft
clearly experienced some form of explosion.''
   ``It's clear that the accident happened in the air because parts
of the wreckage are strewn over such a wide area,'' said Rifkind,
who toured the crash site with Price.
   Price also said the way the plane had split into several sections
``would indicate a midair explosion.''
   Asked on NBC-TV's Today show about the reported bomb threats,
Price said: ``No, we did not have any specific information such as
that in London.''
   When he was asked how many Americans were on board, he said he
``understood that there were some 49 servicemen'' on the jet.
   Also on the jet was John Mulroy, director of international
comunications for The Associated Press. Mulroy, 59, died along with
five family members.
   Wednesday's crash, the worst in British history, occurred 54
minutes after takeoff from London's Heathrow Airport and followed an
apparently routine climb to a cruising altitude of 31,000 feet,
airline officials and traffic controllers said. The only cause ruled
out was a collision with another plane. Freddie Yetman, technical
secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said only
sabotage or structural failure could have destroyed the airplane at
that height, and: ``It seems to me that the possibility of
structural failure is almost too remote to be considered.''
   ``Sabotage is the most likely explanation,'' said David Kyd,
chief public relations officer for the International Air Transport
Association in Geneva. He said structural problems were unlikely to
have been involved.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler said Wednesday night in New
York that the possibility of an explosion was ``only speculation.''
   ``We have no indication there were any problems,'' Kriendler
said. ``There was no mayday (distress) signal.''
   Police Superintendant Angus Kennedy told a news conference today
that the bodies of 150 passengers, including three children, had
been recovered and were taken to a makeshift morgue in the town hall.
   Around the town, singed pillows, lifejackets and fragments of
clothing lay scattered in gardens. Chunks of metal, some as small as
coins and two feet in diameter, had sliced through roofs and
shattered windows in homes and cars.
   The wreckage was strewn over a 10-mile area, and it appeared the
Boeing 747's nose fell to earth before the main part of the jet
struck Lockerbie.
   The plane's 243 passengers, many of them carrying Christmas
packages, included three children, 38 undergraduates studying abroad
on a Syracuse University program and the U.N. commissioner for
Namibia, Bernt Carlsson of Sweden. The plane had a seating capacity
of 412.
   There also was a crew of 16 aboard the ill-fated plane.
   The plane had a long history of maintenance problems, including
an on-board fire, cracks and severe corrosion, service information
filed with the Federal Aviation Administration showed.
   The 18{-year-old jet, the 15th 747 built by Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, experienced at least 24 mechanical difficulties severe
enough to warrant notation, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   The jet's blue-and-white nose section, its Clipper name ``Maid of
the Seas'' clearly visible, landed three miles short of Lockerbie,
near a church in Tundergarth.
   Eight bodies fell on the Tundergarth golf course. They were
covered in tarpaulins and under police guard.
   John Boyd, the area's chief constable, said the 747 struck a hill
outside Lockerbie and, in town, hit a gas station and two rows of
houses and blasted a huge crater in the highway.
   The crash, at 2:19 p.m. EST, happened while Sheila McDonald was
delivering Christmas presents to a friend's home on a hillside
overlooking the 2,500-resident town.
   ``This V-shaped object just seemed to come flying through the air
... it was the wings and front section of an aircraft ... another
part came just behind and all around seemed to be red dots like
sparks,'' she said.
   The investigation will be conducted by a 10-member team from the
Department of Transport's Air Accident Investigation Branch.
National Transportation Safety Board officials from Washington were
also dispatched to help.

   South Africa signed an accord today
granting independence to South-West Africa, the continent's last
colony, which will become the black-ruled nation of Namibia.
   South Africa's foreign minister, R.F. Botha, signed the pact at
U.N. Headquarters along with the foreign ministers of Cuba and
Angola, who also pledged to send home 50,000 Cuban troops posted in
Angola.
   U.S.-mediated negotiations over the last year led to the accords,
which were witnessed by Secretary of State George P. Shultz, U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and other diplomats.
   ``The regional settlement concluded here today represents a
momentous turning point in the history of southern Africa,'' Shultz
said.
   ``With the independence of Namibia, Africa's last colonial
question will have been resolved. As the guns fall silent across the
borders of southwestern Africa, the world will look to the nations''
of the region to resolve ``their pressing internal matters through
peaceful means,'' he said, referring to the civil war beween
Angola's government and U.S.-backed rebels.
   ``The governments and individuals gathered in this place have
truly given the world a special gift,'' said Shultz.
   The agreement is for a one-year transition to independence for
Namibia to begin April 1.
   The pact calls for 3,000 Cuban troops to leave Angola by April 1,
and for all of them to be gone by July 1, 1991. Half of the 50,000
soldiers are to pull out by Nov. 1, 1989, when Namibia is to hold
its first free elections for a national assembly, under U.N.
supervision.
   Foreign Ministers Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba and Afonso van Dumen
of Angola then signed an agreement under which 70 U.N. peacekeepers
will monitor the Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
   Cuba, Angola and the United Nations do not officially recognize
that the two accords are linked. They have always insisted on
Namibia's independence as a matter of principle, without conditions.
   South Africa insisted on the Cuban withdrawal in talks mediated
by Chester Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs.
   One diplomat who had been expected to attend was Bernt Carlsson
of Sweden, the U.N. commissioner for Namibia, who was aboard the Pam
Am jetliner that crashed in Scotland Wednesday night.
   Carlsson, 50, was flying from London to New York when the plane
crashed. No survivors were reported among the 259 passengers and
crew.
   A decade-old Security Council plan for Namibia's independence
calls for about 2,000 civilian administrators and military police to
back about 7,500 U.N. peacekeepers as South African troops withdraw
and a civilian government is organized.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which has fought
South African forces in Namibia for more than 20 years, was not part
of the accords but said it will honor a cease-fire.
   The organization is recognized by the United Nations as the
legitimate representative of the Namibian people and holds
non-voting observer status in the world body.
   The guerrillas battling the Marxist government of Angola were
also excluded from the accords.
   Crocker told reporters Wednesday that UNITA _ the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola _ also supports the accords.
   Crocker indicated Washington will not give diplomatic recognition
to Angola unless it holds peace talks with UNITA.
   Angola has refused to talk with the rebels.
   Cuban troops went to Angola in 1975 to help it fight invading
South African troops and the guerrillas.
   South Africa has ruled the mineral-rich territory of Namibia,
which now has a population of roughly 1.2 million, since capturing
it from Germany during World War I. In 1920 the League of Nations
granted South Africa a mandate to administer Namibia; the United
Nations revoked that mandate in 1966.

   The Justice Department said today it has
offered the services of the FBI's forensics and disaster units to
the British in connection with the crash of a Pan Am jumbo jet over
Scotland.
   The offer of assistance was being made through L. Paul Bremer,
head of the State Department's counter-terrorism office, said
Justice Department spokesman Loye Miller.
   FBI officials were meeting at headquarters in Washington to
discuss the situation and have been monitoring it, said William
Carter, a bureau spokesman.
   ``The FBI is following this matter to ascertain the facts,'' the
bureau said in a statement. ``FBI legal attaches in London are in
contact with British authorities concerning the crash of Pan
American Flight 103 in Scotland.''
   A Justice Department employee, Michael Bernstein, was among those
aboard the craft, said department spokesman Miller. Bernstein was an
attorney working in the Office of Special Investigations, the
department's Nazi-hunting unit.
   Bernstein, 36, had been in Austria negotiating a treaty that
would allow some former Nazis in the United States to be returned to
that country, said department sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Bernstein was married and had two children.
   Because Bernstein had been aboard the craft, flags at Justice
Department buildings were being flown at half-staff.

   A support group of relatives and friends of
people killed in the nation's second-deadliest air crash helped
console victims of a fresh grief: families of those aboard Pan Am
Flight 103.
   ``We came to offer support ... to be here when people were being
informed that their loved ones were confirmed, because we can truly
identify with these people and we know exactly what they're going
through,'' said Lisa Recker, whose brother was among the 156 people
killed in the crash of Northwest Flight 255 on Aug. 16, 1987.
   The Pan Am flight began in London and was en route to New York
when it crashed in Scotland on Wednesday, killing all 259 people
aboard.
   Some passengers were to change planes in New York and continue to
Detroit as Pan Am Flight 226, which arrived at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport at 12:15 a.m. today.
   And the news that as many as 10 Detroit-area passengers were
aboard the ill-fated London flight drew out the Northwest support
group.
   ``We live that day every day,'' Recker said. ``But we vowed as a
group that we would go on in outreach in case these nightmares every
happened again. When this happened to us, we wished somebody would
be there, somebody who could tell us the truth.''
   Recker and Betty Polec, whose daughter and son-in-law died in the
Northwest crash, said they consoled four families at the airport
Wednesday night.
   Pan Am released no names of victims by early today, but it was
learned that two Detroit-area auto executives and relatives of at
least four other Michigan families were aboard.
   James Fuller, 50, vice president in charge of Volkswagen United
States Inc., and Lou Marengo, 33, marketing director for the
Troy-based automaker, had boarding passes for the flight, Volkswagen
spokesman Tom McDonald said.
   ``We're extremely saddened and this is at the present as close to
confirmation as we have,'' Volkswagen spokesman Jay Amastoy.
   Airline employees at the airport whisked away relatives and
friends of victims to a private area as they arrived to await the
connecting flights.
   Eugene and Lelia Coleman of Southfield said their daughter,
LaWanna Thomas, was supposed to be on Pan Am Flight 55 that arrived
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport from London in the afternoon. She
wasn't on the plane.
   The Colemans then were taken by Pan Am employees to a private
room to check passenger lists. Airline officials apparently did not
confirm whether the daughter was on the flight.
   Thomas' sister, Terri Coleman, left the room grief-stricken.
   Thomas, a 21-year-old Air Force sergeant, had been stationed in
West Germany since April, said the woman's grandmother, Edith
Marshall. She was traveling with her 2-month-old son, Jonathan, a
baby that relatives had never seen, Marshall said.

<TEXT>
   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, expected to be the first
black to join President-elect Bush's Cabinet, moves easily in
Democratic as well as Republican circles, according to friends and
associates of the school administrator.
   Sullivan, 55, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in
Atlanta, was expected to be formally announced today as Bush's
secretary of health and human services.
   He had drawn criticism from anti-abortion activists this week
after he said in an interview that women should have a right to
choose abortion. He later said he opposes abortion but would allow
it in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life was endangered.
   Friends describe him as a political independent whose
associations with lawmakers range from rural Georgia figures to
Bush, who attended a dedication ceremony at the medical school in
1982 and invited Sullivan on a trip to Africa later that year.
   Dr. Jim Kaufmann, a friend of Sullivan's since the 1970s, said
Sullivan has been ``very close'' to Bush and his wife, Barbara, a
member of the medical school's board of trustees since 1983.
   ``He has strong Republican leanings,'' Kaufmann said. ``That
doesn't mean he's not a strong Democratic supporter. That's how it
is when you represent a school and you're trying to develop
education. He works well with everybody.''
   Sullivan had never made public statements on his views about
abortion until Bush began considering him to lead the Department of
Health and Human Services. His remarks on the subject in an Atlanta
newspaper interview Sunday _ in which he said he supports a woman's
right to seek an abortion but opposes federal funding to pay for it
_ brought an outcry from anti-abortion forces.
   Monday, Sullivan wrote a letter to The Atlanta Journal and The
Atlanta Constitution saying he is ``opposed to abortion except in
cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is
threatened.''
   Dr. Clint Warner, chairman of the Morehouse medical school's
board of trustees, said Sullivan's views on abortion are aligned
with those of Bush.
   ``His views are consistent with the president and, more
importantly, consistent with the law,'' Warner said. ``Dr. Sullivan
is the most qualified person in the country for that position. I
think the president holds that view, too.''
   Kaufmann said Sullivan is not a political neophyte, but has
generally steered clear of political controversies.
   He said Sullivan ``got so attached to Bush'' about four years ago
because he felt Bush would be ``a pro-education president.''
   Lee Raudonis, executive director of the Republican Party of
Georgia, said Sullivan has never actively worked with the state
party or aligned himself with it.
   ``Dr. Sullivan has been very close to the president-elect. He has
participated in some functions, but he has not been listed as an
active member,'' Raudonis said. ``He's tried to remain independent.
I don't recall that he's attended any Republican Party
fund-raisers.''
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said Sullivan, a native Atlantan, is
widely respected in the city's mostly Democratic black community and
regularly visits Lewis' Washington office to update him on the
medical school's progress.
   ``When he's in Washington, he keeps us briefed on what is
happening _ he uses our office sort of as his office _ because
Morehouse is in the heart of the district,'' Lewis said.
   Sullivan set up many influential political contacts during his
efforts to establish the Morehouse medical program in the 1970s.
Lewis said Sullivan, on behalf of the medical school, ``made
contacts early'' with ``some of the movers and shakers in Georgia
politics,'' including Sens. Sam Nunn and Wyche Fowler as well as Tom
Murphy, speaker of the Georgia House and a powerful Democrat.
   ``If anyone can come to grips with Health and Human Services in
this time of limited resources, I think Dr. Sullivan could,'' Lewis
said. ``One thing I can say about him: he's a hard worker. He's
persistent and he's very aggressive.''
   Professionally, Sullivan is a blood specialist who has been
president of the Morehouse School of Medicine since 1981. He has
taught medicine at Harvard, Morehouse, the New Jersey College of
Medicine and Boston University, where he graduated with honors in
1958.

   Here, at a glance, are developments today involving the crash of
Pan American World Airways Flight 103 Wednesday night in Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed all 259 people aboard and more than 20 people
on the ground:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE CRASH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The jumbo jet, a Boeing 747, apparently exploded in the air
before crashing and investigators focused on terrorist threats to
place a bomb on a Pan Am airliner.
   The crash occurred 54 minutes after takeoff from London's
Heathrow Airport following a routine climb to a cruising altitude of
31,000 feet. The only possible cause immediately ruled out was a
collision with another aircraft.
   Searchers recovered both the airplane's flight recorders.
   Scottish Secretary Malcom Rifkind, the chief British official at
the site, said the widespread wreckage indicated ``the aircraft
clearly experienced some form of explosion.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LOCKERBIE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The wreckage of the 747 scattered bodies and debris over 10 miles
of countryside and ravaged the village of Lockerbie.
   Twenty-two people were killed on the ground, most of them in cars
hits by wreckage, authorities said. Forty houses were destroyed when
the plane crashed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SABOTAGE LIKELY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The International Air Transport Association believes sabotage is
the most likely explanation for the crash.
   David Kyd, chief public relations officer, said ``it would seem
to us that the most likely hypothesis is an explosion aboard,'' and
that structural problems were unlikely to have been involved in the
crash because of the sudden loss of contact with the plane. The 747
has a reputation for ruggedness and is able to stay aloft even with
serious damage to the structure.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BOMB THREATS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The State Department warned U.S. embassies that a bomb threat had
been made against Pan Am jetliners flying from Frankfurt to the
United States 2{ weeks ago and the Federal Aviation Administration
told Pan Am this month that the airline might be the target of a
terrorist bombing.
   An unidentified U.S. government source said a a person claiming
to belong to the Abu Nidal group, a radical Palestinian faction,
telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, about two weeks
ago and said a bomb would be placed aboard a Pan Am plane and that
it would be carried by a woman.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CLAIM OF RESPONSIBILITY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An anonymous caller to the AP office in London claimed
responsibility for the crash and said it was in retaliation for the
downing of an Iran Air Airbus by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in
July.
   ``We, the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, are undertaking
this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the Iran air plane by
America a few months ago and keeping the Shah's family in America.
We are very proud,'' the male caller said, then hung up quickly.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CRASH-PLO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization said
it was ``nonsensical'' to link Palestinians to the crash.
   ``It cannot possibly occur to the Palestinians or the Arabs to
commit such an act,'' Mahmoud Abbas, code-named Abu-Mazen, told
reporters when asked about reports that the plane may have been
downed by sabotage.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PLANE MAINTENANCE RECORD</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The jumbo jet that crashed had at least 24 mechanical problems
during the past eight years, including cracks, severe corrosion and
an on-board fire, according to FAA service records.
   FAA spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane said there have been problems with
minor cracks in 747s over the past few years, but inspections did
not find much cracking.
   ``Those are certainly very reliable airplanes,'' she said, adding
that the problems reported did not appear unusual given the length
of time the plane had been in service.
   Officials at Pratt & Whitney in said they doubted their engines,
which powered the aircraft, caused the crash, and that the plane
could have continued to fly even if three of the four engines failed
at once.

   A mother eager to welcome her child home for the
holidays wailed ``my baby, my baby'' upon learning the worst at
Kennedy Airport, where Flight 103's fate was reduced to a flickering
message on a gray screen: See Agent.
   Over and over, happy anticipation changed to shock and grief
Wednesday night, as relatives of those aboard the Pan Am jet learned
it had crashed en route from London to New York. Authorities
believed there were no survivors among the 259 aboard.
   ``Many of these people were coming home just for the holidays,
for Christmas,'' said Carla Abell, the volunteer disaster nursing
chairwoman for greater New York, who helped counsel about 25
families at an airport lounge.
   ``Some of the families are going through the terrible part of,
`Oh, I shouldn't have insisted that they come home,' or, `Oh, why
did I ever allow them to go over,'' Ms. Abell said.
   As she spoke, just hours after the flight was to have landed
Wednesday, a sobbing woman passed by only to find herself facing
dozens of bright lights and cameras.
   ``Look, my son is dead. What else do you want?'' she screamed,
her words hanging in silence long after she had left the spot.
   She was anguished over the loss of her son, a Syracuse student
who celebrated his birthday three days ago.
   ``It's so sad,'' said Ms. Abell. ``He just turned 21 and was so
excited to come home and share all of his great experience with his
family and friends.
   ``And, you know, there was a big party planned for tonight at
home with a big sandwich and a cake and all the presents and now
who's going to be opening the presents,'' added Ms. Abell, whose
eyes glistened with emotion.
   Some of the friends and relatives of the passengers had to be
treated for shock or high blood pressure as they learned of the
crash, according to Red Cross spokeswoman Debra Ricciardi.
   ``It was a horrible surprise,'' she said. ``Some were completely
overcome. A couple just collapsed. Others went into shock. It's
heartbreaking.''
   At Syracuse University, more than 25,000 people attending a
basketball game paused for a minute of silence after it was learned
that 38 students in the school's European study program had been on
the jet. At the campus chapel, weeping students gathered in
disbelief as they heard the news.
   Rabbi Milton Elefant, chaplain of the Jewish students at
Syracuse, arrived at Kennedy and said he spoke with the families of
three victims from Syracuse.
   ``Some are just feeling that the end has come. One woman had to
talk her heart out. Another couple felt they would meet their son
again in another life and were strong. A third couple was somewhere
in the middle,'' he recalled.
   Neither Pan Am nor the university had released passenger names by
early today, saying the list still had to be compiled and relatives
notified.
   However, some names were divulged by other sources.
   James Fuller, 50, vice president in charge of Volkswagen United
States Inc., and Lou Marengo, 33, the company's marketing director,
had boarding passes for Flight 103 and apparently died in the crash,
Volkswagen spokesman Tom McDonald said in Troy, Mich.
   Also aboard were the U.N. commissioner for Namibia, Bernt
Carlsson, 50, of Sweden; and John Mulroy, The Associated Press
director of international communications, and his son, Sean, and
daughter-in-law, Ingrid.
   The Washington Post today quoted an unidentified State Department
spokesman as saying six members of the department's Diplomatic
Security Service, who were returning from Beirut, were aboard. State
Department spokesman Ben Justesen said he could not confirm the
report.
   Also aboard were some U.S. servicemen, including First Lt. George
W. Williams, 24, said his father, George Williams of Joppatowne, Md.
The younger Williams, who was stationed near Frankfurt, got on the
plane because a traffic jam caused him to miss an earlier one, the
father said.
   Grieving relatives at Kennedy were kept from reporters, who
generally refrained from asking questions when they got near shaken
family members.
   ``My baby, my baby,'' sobbed one woman who was supported by
security officers as she was led to an elevator. She later
collapsed, shaking and crying on the floor.
   Pan Am spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler said the plane crashed in the
Scottish village of Lockerbie, exploding into a huge fireball and
setting fire to dozens of homes.
   For a few relatives of the passengers, the first word that
something was wrong came on the television screens listing arrivals,
where beside Flight 103 was ``See AGT.''
   At an airport tavern called the Concourse Clipper Club, about 20
people were watching a blaring television set as the evening news
came on with an update on the disaster. A somber Pan Am employee
walked over and turned down the volume.
   ``It's a horrible thing to see people finding out this kind of
news,'' said Ms. Ricciardi of the Red Cross.

<TEXT>
   A judge sentenced former car-racing star
Randy Lanier to life in prison without the possibility of parole for
helping run a multimillion-dollar marijuana-smuggling operation.
   Before the sentencing Wednesday, Lanier, the 1986 Indianapolis
500 Rookie of the Year, tearfully told U.S. District Judge James
Foreman that the punishment would be ``cruel and unusual.''
   An attorney for Lanier said he would appeal the sentence.
   ``It is unfair and unjust to impose a sentence of life without
parole for a marijuana offense, regardless of the amount,'' said the
attorney, Robert Ritchie.
   In sentencing Lanier, Foreman said that of the 300 to 400 cocaine
cases he had presided over, invariably the defendants started out
using marijuana.
   ``You have caused a lot of heartache, and individually you've
ruined a lot of lives in this country,'' Foreman told Lanier, who
stood before the court wiping away tears. ``Look at what it's done
to you.''
   A federal jury convicted Lanier, 34, of Davie, Fla., and two
co-defendants on Oct. 4 of charges of engaging in a continuing
criminal enterprise, which carries a mandatory sentence of life, and
conspiring to distribute more than 1,000 pounds of marijuana between
1982 and 1986.
   A fourth defendant was found guilty of the distribution charges
in the 15-week trial.
   Lanier also received the maximum 40-year sentence on the
distribution charge plus five years on a third charge of conspiring
to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. He also was ordered to
forfeit $60 million in drug proceeds.
   Prosecutors contended the drug ring smuggled more than 600,000
pounds of Colombian marijuana into the United States by barge.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Carr urged a stiff sentence.
   ``You have before you, judge, one of the richest men in the
United States because of his dealings in drugs,'' Carr said. ``It is
now time for the court to send a message that this will not be
tolerated.''
   Convicted with Lanier on the criminal enterprise and distribution
charges were Ben Kramer, 34, of Miami, and Eugene Fischer, 48, of
Coral Gables, Fla.
   Foreman sentenced both men Dec. 5 to life in prison without
parole on the criminal enterprise charge. On the second count,
Kramer received the maximum 40 years and Fischer got 35 years.
   On Dec. 12, Foreman sentenced the fourth defendant, Kay Dee Bell
Jr., 43, of Redwood City, Calif., to 25 years in prison for
conspiring to distribute more than 1,000 pounds of marijuana.
   Lanier and Kramer, a former power-boat racer, each cleared $68
million from the operation, prosecutors said, while Fischer got more
than $31 million. The three men were forced to forfeit a total of
about $150 million.

<TEXT>
   The family of the late Shah of Iran, including
son Reza Phlavi II, heir to the Peacock Throne, live in the United
States nearly 10 years after the end of the shah's rule in Iran.
   An anonymous caller to The Associated Press in London who claimed
responsibility for the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 said it was in
retaliation for the United States' harboring of the shah and his
family when they were driven from Iran, as well as the downing of an
Iran Air flight by a U.S. ship in July.
   The shah was denied permanent sanctuary in the United States and,
suffering from cancer, shuttled with his family from country to
country, with stops in Morocco, Mexico, Panama and the Bahamas,
before being granted asylum in Egypt, where he died.
   The family moved to the United States in 1984. His son Reza
Phlavi, whom exiled supporters now call the Shah, lives at an estate
in Virginia, just outside Washington, with his wife, Yasmine.
   The late shah's wife, Farah, and their other children, Farahnaz,
Ali Reza, and Leila, also live in the United States.

<HEAD>`What's a Press Conference?' Asks Youth Commission's Youngest
Member</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newest member of the city's Youth
Commission certainly understands what it's like to be young. He's
only 7 himself.
   Edward Andrews _ Teddy to his friends _ was sworn in Tuesday to
the commission by Berkeley City Council member Don Jelinek, who said
the boy was a key worker in his successful bid for re-election.
   Showing a flair for ethnic politics, Teddy greeted reporters in
two Chinese dialects before the swearing-in ceremony. But he still
has a way to go in the political world; when asked by reporters how
he liked the press conference, he replied: ``What's a press
conference?''
   Jelinek's confidence remained unshaken.
   ``I decided it would make a great appointment,'' he said.
``Here's a rare opportunity to have the wisdom of someone who is
physically 7 years old but has a mental and intellectual age of
someone 10 years older.''
   The commission meets monthly and advises the City Council on
youth issues. Andrews is the youngest of about 400 commissioners who
serve Berkeley on 43 boards and commissions.
   The job really is a reward for the boy's work on Jelinek's
campaign, the councilman said.
   ``I worked with his mother and other tenants of the Carlton Hotel
on improving conditions there,'' Jelinek said. ``When the campaign
came around, his mother volunteer PM-ShahFamily 1stLd a0588 12-22 0067

   The Boeing 747 that crashed in Scotland had
been repaired for at least 21 mechanical difficulties since 1980,
including a small inboard fire and a large crack in an upper
bulkhead, according to federal records.
   Federal Aviation Administration service records show that in
November 1987, a 16.3-inch crack near the upper part of the fuselage
bulkhead was discovered in the plane that crashed Wednesday in
Scotland with 259 people aboard. Investigators today focused on
terrorist threats to place a bomb on the jet, and officials said
sabotage seemed the most likely cause of the crash.
   The FAA report said the crack in the plane was corrosion-related,
and corrosion was noted in the plane's floor beam and other areas.
   According to records filed March 25, a leading edge slat fell off
the plane during takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, and the slat
section was found on the runway.
   In October 1987, maintenance workers responding to a Boeing
service bulletin suggesting inspections of the plane and all similar
aircraft found severe corrosion at the rear bulkhead and on part of
the fuselage, the report said.
   A Boeing spokesman said the plane was taken out of service last
year for substantial modifications, and any structural deficiencies
observed earlier would have been corrected.
   Other service difficulties cited included a sheared nose gear
bolt, a missing pylon panel, two instances of smoke in the passenger
cabin and fire spewing from an engine pylon.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes, which builds the 747 in Everett,
Wash., has no comment on the reports, company spokesman Craig Martin
said Wednesday night. And Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler said he
could not comment because he did not have the plane's service
history.
   In Washington, FAA spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane said there have been
problems with minor cracks in 747s, and the FAA put out a directive
to have the planes inspected.
   But she said the inspections did not find much cracking. ``Those
are certainly very reliable airplanes,'' she said.
   Officials at Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, Conn., said they
doubted their engines, which powered the aircraft, were responsible
for the crash. Company investigators were dispatched to the accident
scene.
   The 747-100, tail number N739PA, was delivered to Pan American
World Airways in February 1970 and was the 15th 747 built, said
David Jimenez, another Boeing spokesman.
   The plane had flown an estimated 72,000 hours and about 16,500
cycles, with one cycle being a takeoff and landing, said Boeing's
Jack Gamble. Jimenez said 50,000 cycles is considered high for a
commerical jetliner.
   A Pan Am 747 was one of two jets involved in the worst disaster
in commercial aviation history: the March 27, 1977, collision
between two 747s at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, in which 582
people died.

<HEAD>Officials Find No Connection Between Finland Threat and Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry said today it had
found no direct connection between a telephoned bomb threat to the
embassy and the crash of a Pan Am jetliner in Scotland.
   In a statement, the ministry confirmed the Israeli and U.S.
embassies had received several threats during the year by an Arab
resident, most recently on Dec. 5.
   The statement indicated the authorities knew the caller's
identity, and said ``the suspected phone caller has not left Finland
since he made his last threatening telephone call'' 17 days ago.
   ``In the investigation so far, no direct connection has been
found between the Arab living in Finland and the air accident in
question,'' said the statement, read to The Associated Press by a
spokesman.
   It did not elaborate on how police could be certain the threat
was not linked to Wednesday's crash, in which 259 passengers and
crew were killed. Twenty-two people also were killed on the ground
in Lockerbie, Scotland, where the plane crashed.
   A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman referred all questions to the State
Department.
   In Washington, Undersecretary of State Ronald Spiers said the
Federal Aviation Administration issued an alert after a bomb threat
was received by the Helsinki embassy on Dec. 5.
   A U.S. government source said in Washington that the threat was
made by a person claiming to belong to the Abu Nidal organization, a
radical Palestinian faction which broke away from the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a Pan Am plane and
would be carried by a woman, said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.

   A British Airways Tristar made an unscheduled stop in
Rome today after an anonymous caller said a bomb had been planted on
board, officials said.
   Authorities closed Rome's main Leonardo da Vinci airport for 20
minutes while the passengers disembarked and the plane was moved to
an isolated area, where the aircraft and the luggage were examined.
   Flight 146 originated in New Delhi and stopped in Kuwait before
heading toward its destination, London, said Carla Rossi, a British
Airways employee at the Rome airport. It landed at Rome at about 4
p.m.
   The plane was carrying 242 people.
   Ms. Rossi said someone had called the airline's London office and
said a bomb was on board the aircraft.
   On Wednesday night, a Pan Am Boeing 747 flying from London to New
York crashed in a Scottish village, killing all 259 passengers and
crew.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly has adopted a budget
by consensus for the first time in more than 40 years, and the
fiscal plan includes financial reforms backed by both the United
States and Soviet Union.
   The United States responded to Wednesday's action by paying
nearly $30 million of the more than $500 million it owes in back
dues to the world body, a U.N. official said.
   The budget adopted Wednesday allocates $1.76 billion for 1990 and
1991, about $22 million less than the revised figures for the
1988-89 budget. It does not include funds for several special
peacekeeping operations.
   ``In real terms, what is happening is staff is being reduced, so
personnel costs are going down, and all other costs are being held
at zero growth,'' said U.N. financial spokesman Fred Eckhard.
   U.S., Soviet, Japanese and Western European officials sought a 15
percent U.N. staff reduction. The world body has cut 12 percent so
far.
   Eckhard said a U.S. Treasury official gave the United Nations a
check for $29.6 million today.
   The United States is assessed for one-fourth of the U.N.'s
regular budget.
   By September, the United States was behind more than $500 million
in payments. Eckhard said today's U.S. payment reduced the U.S.
arrears to $307.7 million for the regular budget and $96.1 million
for peacekeeping.
   The last time the General Assembly achieved unanimity on the
budget was during its first working session in 1946.
   The Soviets blocked consensus in the first decades of the world
body; and the United States raised roadblocks in recent years and
withheld part of its dues to agitate for reform.
   The United States abstained on the budget resolution last year.
   U.S. delegate Noel L. Gross lauded the assembly action Wednesday
as ``a major step forward in implementing the wide-ranging
administrative and budgetary reforms approved two years ago.''
   Consensus adoption of the budget, which effectively gives the
major contributors to the world body veto power over the budget, was
one of the main reforms the United States wanted when it launched a
campaign to overhaul U.N. management about five years ago.
   Withholding part of the U.S. dues to the world body gave teeth to
the American demands.

<TEXT>
   A burglar who stole an old plastic
piggy bank stuffed with $75 in change has been sentenced to nine
years in prison.
   Palm Beach Circuit Judge Howard Berman cited Henry Hatten's
previous felony convictions before issuing the sentence Wednesday,
ending a trial in which jurors giggled when prosecutors introduced
the piggy bank as evidence.
   ``If you have to be broken into, this is the guy to have,'' said
piggy bank owner Sylvia Jones of Riviera Beach. ``He's very neat, he
doesn't trash the place and he only takes a piggy bank. I don't know
if he's extremely bright if that's all he stole.''
   Hatten took the bank July 15, three weeks after completing his
fourth prison sentence in 10 years. Ms. Jones said she bought the
little bank for her son's savings after he was born, almost 32 years
ago.
   But the bank remains in state custody and Ms. Jones wants to
bring home the bacon.
   ``I definitely want it back,'' she said. ``It's been in the
family almost 32 years.''

<DATELINE>NORTH PLATTE, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many high school students, Ivan
Kershner showed up in jeans, passed notes in class and skipped study
hall with a forged pass.
   The next day, though, Kershner buckled down to work again _ as
principal of North Platte High School.
   Kershner traded places with a student Wednesday as part of the
school newspaper's fund-raising effort, Principal For A Day. For 50
cents a chance, students bought tickets for the raffle, which was
won by senior Charles Swanson.
   Swanson showed up Wednesday in suit and tie and spent the day on
such matters as inspecting the grounds for needed repairs and
reviewing lunch policies with administrators.
   Kershner, meanwhile, struggled through Swanson's classes. He
began the day with physics but was forced to leave class early when
he was called to the principal's office and reprimanded for parking
his car in the faculty lot.
   ``Which was good because I wasn't understanding what was
happening in physics,'' Kershner said.
   Then it was on to American history, algebra, Spanish, American
government, English and orchestra. The last was a problem because
Swanson plays first-chair viola while Kershner said he plays
``25th-chair harmonica.''
   Kershner said if he were to trade places with Swanson
permanently, he would have to drop physics and orchestra and enroll
in remedial algebra.
   ``Anybody who thinks school is for kids _ implying it is easy, it
is not a job or it is not the real world _ is sadly mistaken,''
Kershner said. ``I worked hard today. I learned things I have never
known before and I was challenged.''
   ``There's an awful lot of hard work in being a student in today's
schools,'' he added. ``Kids simply are expected to know more now
than any other point in history and there is more to know now than
any point in history.''
   Swanson, too, found the principal's job harder than expected.
During the day, he discussed student tardiness and ideas for an open
campus with associate principals, observed classes, served as hall
monitor and was host at a faculty Christmas party.
   ``I'd imagine in some ways it's harder to be a student, but
altogether, I think it's harder being a principal.'' Swanson said.
``There are a lot more people to take care of and a whole lot of
responsibility. It's a tough job.''

   John Mulroy, director of international
communications for The Associated Press, died along with five family
members in the crash of a New York-bound Pan Am jetliner.
   Local authorities said no survivors were found from among the 259
people aboard Flight 103 after the plane crashed Wednesday in the
village of Lockerbie in southern Scotland. More than 20 others died
on the ground, officials said today.
   Mulroy was traveling with five family members, including his
25-year-old son, Sean, and Sean's wife, Ingrid, who were residents
of Sweden.
   Mulroy's sister, Bridget Concannon, her husband, Thomas, and the
couple's son, Sean, who lived in a London suburb, also were aboard.
   Mulroy, 59, joined the AP in August 1984 after 25 years with Pan
Am, where he had been director of communications. He was a native of
County Mayo, Ireland, and maintained a second home in the land of
his birth.
   Mulroy joined the news cooperative as staff executive for
international communications. He was appointed deputy director of
communications in 1986 and director of international communications
in 1988, based in New York. In that position, he was responsible for
all AP technical operations outside the United States.
   He was born April 1, 1929, and held an associate degree in
electrical engineering from Birmingham University in England.
   ``John Mulroy had been with us only four years but his
contributions were immense,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP president
and general manager.
   ``He guided the streamlining of our international news and
picture communications systems during a time of accelerated
modernization. He did that with a wit and warmth that made him a
treasured member of our team.
   ``To say that we will miss him does not begin to describe our
sense of loss.''
   Survivors include Mulroy's wife, Josephine, of East Northport, on
New York's Long Island, a daughter, Siobhan, 26, and a son, Brendan,
23.
   The Associated Press said condolences may be sent to the family
home at 35 Cherrywood Drive, East Northport, N.Y., 11731.

   Hundreds clustered around Syracuse
University's chapel to share the horrible news that 38 students were
aboard a doomed Pan Am flight, listen to prayers and utter a common
refrain, ``It can't be true.''
   ``It still hasn't really hit,'' said Chris Healy, a junior from
Seaford, N.Y. He said one of his friends was among the students in a
Syracuse University program who were booked on the jetliner that
crashed Wednesday in Scotland.
   Authorities believed there were no survivors among the 259 people
aboard Flight 103, which was en route from London to New York.
   ``It's hard to think of Christmas this year. I think about the
parents, who hadn't seen their kids since August,'' Healy said as he
was joined by a group of anguished friends at Hendricks Memorial
Chapel.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo issued a statement today expressing his
sorrow and ordering flags at all state facilities be flown at
half-staff through Saturday.
   ``For all the lives lost and particularly to the Syracuse
University community, we extend our most profound and heartfelt
sympathies and our prayers for strength,'' Cuomo said.
   Elsewhere on campus Wednesday night, more than 25,000 people
attending a basketball game paused for a minute of silence and a
brief prayer by the university minister.
   Inside the chapel, about 500 mourners sat in silence and lit
candles at a prayer service led by chaplains of five faiths. The
Rev. Paul Kowalewski, a Protestant chaplain, said the ceremony
filled a need in the university community.
   ``We gathered because we needed to come together. The students
needed to demonstrate their sorrow, to be with one another,''
Kowalewski said. ``It's Christmas, they're students and young _
everything in a tragedy is built into this.''
   The 38 students were part of a group of about 250, mostly
juniors, selected for study in Europe based on their academic
standing and ability to adapt to a foreign country, said Lore Heath,
associate director of the university's Division of International
Programs Abroad.
   The program includes the cost of their flight over, but students
made their own arrangements for return travel, Heath said. The
semester's program ended Saturday.
   University Chancellor Melvin Eggers called the crash ``one of the
greatest tragedies in Syracuse University history.''
   ``This is the saddest day of my life,'' he said. ``We've lost
some of the brightest, talented, most beautiful people. It's hard to
express our sorrow.''
   Eggers said the fact that the crash may have been the result of a
terrorist act made it even harder for families and friends of the
victims.
   ``The first impact of such an event plummets us into almost
depair,'' Eggers said this morning on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``But
to learn that it might have been a deliberate act is just beyond
belief, something we can't cope with.''
   Farshad Hajir of South Orange, N.J., a senior who learned that a
close friend had been returning on the Pan Am plane, said in a
cracking voice:
   ``I told her what a great experience it would be to study abroad.
I encouraged her. Then you come back to hear this. What can I say?''
   Nearby, people clustered in small huddles to seek consolation.
Pain and disbelief were evident in most faces. Friends hugged one
another and cried together.
   ``It can't be true,'' was a common refrain amid the sobs that
split the chill night.
   ``This is the mood that's all around,'' said junior Scott Meach,
pointing to emotional people around the chapel's front steps.
   ``It's really so hard to believe,'' said Meach, a resident of
West Bloomfield, Mich., who said one of his fraternity brothers was
on the jetliner. ``It helps to bring people together to share the
pain.''
   George H. Couch, a junior in geography, also came to pray for a
fraternity brother. ``The thing about this,'' Couch said, ``is that
at our age you feel so indestructible. You see it happening on
television, but don't think it will ever happen to us.''

<TEXT>
   Divers and scientists failed again
today to rescue a bottlenose dolphin that became stranded in the
chilly waters off this coastal community after neglecting to migrate
south for the winter.
   At one point the rescuers managed to snare the frisky dolphin in
a net, but the mammal slipped away before he could be brought out of
Broad Bay.
   The effort was then suspended until Jan. 4 to reassess strategy
and get a stronger net, said Robert Helfant, captain of the
emergency medical services dive team in Virginia Beach.
   ``The net wasn't really the right kind of net,'' Helfant said.
``The biggest thing is safety for both the fish and the people.''
   Rescue officials were worried about the divers safety because one
diver got caught in the net. The diver had to be cut out, but he was
uninjured, said Bruce Edwards, director of emergency medical
services.
   Excited shouts and curses came from the divers as they briefly
trapped the animal. ``Get it together,'' one diver shouted as he
handled the net.
   About 10 boats left around dawn in the second day of the rescue
attempt. Divers and marine scientists tried for seven hours
Wednesday to rescue the dolphin, nicknamed ``Rascal,'' before
suspending the effort until this morning.
   ``Everything went right except for the dolphin,'' said Robert
Schoelkopf, the leader of the effort to move the dolphin to warmer
water.
   The young dolphin remained strong enough to evade the net despite
being stuck in the 40-degree water with little food, Schoelkopf said.
   ``He's not weak at all,'' he said. Still, he added, the mammal
remained in danger from the cold water.
   If the 200- to 300-pound dolphin is caught, he will be airlifted
by a Coast Guard helicopter to waters off North Carolina's Outer
Banks.
   Thirteen rescue vessels, ranging from inflatable rafts to
sport-fishing boats and carrying more than 50 people, made a
half-dozen attempts Wednesday to net the dolphin.
   About 100 spectators gathered Wednesday on a point of land near a
narrow channel where most of the rescue attempts took place. Others
watched from private boats, including Mayor Meyera Oberndorf, four
businessmen in suits and nearly two dozen reporters and
photographers.
   Today, about a dozen people watched from the shore, including the
staff of a radio station that broadcast the event live.
   Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in
Brigantine, N.J., said the would-be rescuers were thwarted Wednesday
by strong currents as well as the dolphin's strength. He also said
the mammal was frightened by the number of rescue boats and by the
net.
   Residents believe the dolphin lingered in the bay long after
fellow dolphins headed south because he was frightened by bridge
construction over a narrow channel leading to the open waters of
Chesapeake Bay.
   The National Marine Fisheries Service approved the unusual rescue
Monday and asked Schoelkopf to supervise it because of his
experience rescuing dolphins.

   President Reagan today offered his condolences
to the victims of the Pan Am jet crash as his spokesman defended the
process by which the State Department warned U.S. embassies that a
bomb threat had been made against Pan Am jetliners flying from
Frankfurt to the United States.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he could not explain
why more people had not been notified of the threat, and he
acknowleged that ``the public should be aware'' of such threats.
   ``I think that certainly will be looked at,'' Fitzwater told
reporters. ``Public notification has to be considered.''
   The spokesman said the State Department warned U.S. embassies
around Dec. 7 about a bomb threat had been made two days earlier
against Pan Am jetliners flying from Frankfurt, West Germany, to the
United States 2{ weeks before the crash of a New York-bound flight
originating in Germany.
   At his daily press briefing, Fitzwater said no information had
been discovered ``that can confirm sabotage as the cause'' of the
crash.
   The president, he said, planned to call Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher about the matter later in the day. Reagan has also
dispatched a team of U.S. officials from the Federal Aviation
Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI
to help in the investigation, the spokesman added.
   Fitzwater said the FAA told Pan American World Airways that it
might be the target of a terrorist bombing, and that ``appropriate
police'' in various parts of the world were also told of the Dec. 5
threat.
   Asked why more people weren't warned, Fitzwater said, ``I don't
have an answer on that. There are threats like that on a continuing
basis. ... The issue is there are so many of these (threats) that
this was determined to be the appropriate level of notification.''
   But pressed as to whether the general public should have a chance
to make its own judgments about travel in regard to such threats,
the spokesman said he believed the matter would receive some
consideration.
   ``The public should be aware of the general threat,'' he said.
``Whether (there is) a press release is a thing that should be
considered.''
   ``President Reagan is deeply saddened by this tragic accident.
The president and Mrs. Reagan wish to convey their condolences to
the families of all the victims. The president has promised the full
cooperation and support of the U.S. government in this
investigation,'' Fitzwater said.

   A fire apparently started by a kerosene heater
quickly spread through a one-story home early today, killing six
children and injuring three adults, fire officials said.
   Fourteen people, mostly children, were in the home when the fire
started shortly before 6 a.m., and some escaped by jumping from
windows, said fire Capt. John Welch.
   ``The flames was coming out of those windows just like an
inferno,'' said Myrtle Bell, a neighbor. ``The kids inside were
screaming. They just couldn't get no help.''
   A man and two women were taken to Barnes Hospital where a
spokesman said the man was in critical condition and the women were
in serious condition.
   The names and ages of the victims were withheld, but Welch said
the adults injured were a man, his wife and daughter in her 20s. The
11 children, ranging in age from 1 to 19, were children of either
the couple or their daughter.
   Firefighters arriving at the scene found the four survivors in
front of the brick house on the city's near north side. Survivors
told firefighters there were children inside, but they were unable
to rescue any of the victims, Battalion Chief Frank Schaper said.
   The fire, which apparently was started by a kerosene heater in
the basement, caused extensive damage to the house and its contents,
Schaper said.
   ``The father woke up and saw one of the sons adjusting or doing
something with the heater, and then there was a flash,'' Welch said,
adding that investigators were trying to determine whether the
heater was defective.

   A medical helicopter taking a
7-year-old boy to the hospital crashed in heavy fog early today,
killing the boy and two medical workers and seriously injuring the
pilot, authorities said.
   The helicopter was en route from Marion, Ill., to St. Francis
Medical Center in this southeast Missouri town when it went down in
a field about 4:30 a.m., said Mary Spell, a spokeswoman for the
hospital.
   Spell said the boy was being taken to the hospital for treatment
of a broken neck and back he sustained in a traffic accident.
   Bob Raynesford, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the final communication indicated that the
pilot, Sheldon Rudzek, had decided not to land because of the fog.
   ``The last thing on the radio was the pilot saying he was
breaking off his approach because of the fog,'' Raynesford said.
``It was pretty difficult flying.''
   Deputy Don Hanscom of the Cape Girardeau County sheriff's office
said a farmer found the wreckage, which Spell said was scattered
over a large area.
   Spell identified the dead as Karen Scherer, 26, the flight nurse,
of Cape Girardeau; Julie Hutteger, 22, a St. Francis respiratory
therapist; and the patient, James Rhodes of Marion, Ill.
   Rudzek, of Cape Girardeau, was listed in critical condition with
second- and third-degree burns over half his body and two broken
legs, Spell said.
   She said the helicopter, operated by Air Evac EMS of West Plains,
Mo., was dispatched about 3 a.m. to pick up the boy.

   A grenade exploded near a group
of people standing next to a police station near Cape Town, injuring
13 people, including 10 policemen, authorities said.
   Two children and one woman were hurt in the attack Wednesday,
police said.
   Police said the grenade was tossed from a moving vehicle in
Nyanga township, about 10 miles outside Cape Town. They did not give
the races of the victims, but most policemen in the township are
black.
   Militant anti-apartheid activists consider black policemen to be
collaborators with the white-led government and frequently target
them for attack.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but police have
blamed most such incidents on the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement.

   Burmese refugees who fled a military
crackdown reached a camp in northwestern Thailand on Thursday,
preparing to return home, officials said.
   The first group of 56 students and Buddhist monks traveled to the
repatriation camp at Tak, provincial and police officials said.
Doctors at the camp, which opened Wedesday, said more than half of
them had malaria.
   Tak is about 50 miles from the Burmese border.
   Burma's official Radio Rangoon said the students would be sent to
Bangkok, where the Burmese Embassy has arranged to fly them to Burma.
   After the Sept. 18 military coup in Burma, thousands of students
traveled to anti-government guerrilla bases along the Thai border,
seeking haven or military training.
   The agreement to open the camp was reached in talks last week
between Burmese leader Gen. Saw Maung and Thailand's army chief,
Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the first foreign dignitary to visit
Burma since the coup.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush pledged Thursday to pursue
President Reagan's policy of seeking the removal of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega from power in Panama.
   ``Our policy will be that Noriega must go. There should be no
misunderstanding about our policy,'' Bush told Eric Arturo Delvalle,
the ousted president whom the United States continues to recognize
as Panama's legitimate leader.
   The vice president's words were relayed to reporters by White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater after Bush met privately with
Reagan, Delvalle and national security adviser Colin L. Powell.
   Fitzwater said Delvalle requested the meeting because of ``rumors
and unfounded stories in Panama of a change in U.S. policy.''
   ``He was looking for assurance of steadfastness,'' the spokesman
said.
   Delvalle has lived in hiding in Panama since being deposed last
February by forces loyal to Noriega, who was indicted on
drug-smuggling charges by two federal grand juries in Florida
earlier this year.
   Fitzwater said Delvalle did not suggest any changes in policy and
there was no discussion of relaxing the economic sanctions that the
United States has applied against the Noriega-run government.
   Fitzwater said there was no discussion of the possibility of
Delvalle resigning and no discussion of possible U.S. military
action. As to the latter possibility, he would say only, ``We don't
discuss military options.''
   On Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
appeared to rule out U.S. military force to depose Noriega, saying
that ``Panama's political crisis can be resolved only by
Panamanians.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan commended Delvalle's courage and patriotism
and promised his continued support. He said Delvalle thanked the
president and vice president for their backing.
   The spokesman described the meeting, which lasted about 15
minutes, as ``a general discussion of where we go from here.''
   Delvalle met Wednesday afternoon with Secretary of State George
P. Shultz shortly after his arrival from Panama aboard a U.S.
military jet. Neither man spoke to reporters after the meeting.
   The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that, during
a meeting in Panama City last week with Adm. William J. Crowe Jr.,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Delvalle threatened to give
up his struggle against Noriega unless the United States came up
with a specific plan to remove him.
   The Post said that according to notes of the secret meeting
provided by a source, Delvalle said he saw no reason to continue
making personal ``sacrifices'' without a specific plan of action to
remove Noriega.
   The newspaper said the Dec. 11 meeting also was attended by U.S.
Ambassador to Panama Arthur Davis and the commander of the U.S.
military's Southern Command, Gen. Fred F. Woerner.

   What's in a name? To Judge Shannon Weatherall, who
has decided to start using her given name of Carmen Otero, a lot of
ethnic pride.
   Weatherall, 55, who has served about a decade on the bench, is
the state's only judge of Latin American heritage at the Superior
Court level.
   She is of Spanish and Mexican descent, was raised in New Mexico
and spoke only Spanish until the fourth grade, she said.
   ``One of our family served as the last territorial governor of
the state of New Mexico, and the Otero name long has been woven into
the culture of that part of the community,'' she said.
   Besides discarding the name of a former husband, she is
abandoning the first name she adopted as a student at the University
of Colorado Law School.
   ``I really got tired of answering questions about where was the
rose between my teeth and being asked to dance on the table,'' she
said. ``As an attorney, I wanted to be taken seriously.''
   She said the ``last straw'' was when she received an achievement
award from the state Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ``I knew I had to
do something,'' she said.
   The name change has been approved by a court commissioner and
takes effect Jan. 1.

<HEAD>Dismantled Tanks Will Give Their Engines to Domestic Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union plans to recycle engines from the
10,000 army tanks being withdrawn from Europe for use in the lagging
domestic economy, the official news agency Tass reported Thursday.
   Fuel tanker trucks and cargo trailers attached to the six tank
divisions being disbanded also will be transferred to civilian use,
Tass said, quoting Maj. Gen. Yuri Lebedev of the armed forces
general staff.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the United Nations on Dec. 7
the Soviet armed forces would be cut by 500,000 soldiers in the next
two years to show the West that its intentions are defensive rather
than offensive.
   The reductions include six tank divisions on the front line with
NATO, in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany.
   Gorbachev has said repeatedly that the Soviet Union must
concentrate its resources on domestic problems. Soviet media
previously have reported plans to shift certain military factories
to the production of badly needed consumer goods.
   Last spring, a factory in Odessa reportedly began to convert
missile platforms into 80-ton construction cranes, as the Soviet
Union started dismantling SS-20 rockets under the superpower arms
control treaty signed last year.
   Lebedev denied Western charges that the reductions in Soviet
armed forces in Eastern Europe and the European part of the Soviet
Union would cover only aging, outdated tanks or only auxiliary units
to the armored divisions.
   ``Six tank divisions will be disbanded and the military hardware,
including the most up-to-date tanks, will be destroyed,'' except for
the engines, Tass reported Lebedev as saying. The article said
Lebedev emphasized that the units ``will be pulled out in full stre
ngth, with all their military hardware.''
   Lebedev also said the Soviet Union expects the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ``to take reciprocal steps'' toward making its
armed forces truly defensive, Tass reported.
   Lebedev also said the greatest difficulty for the Soviet Union in
connection with the troop cuts will be finding housing for the
veteran servicemen. The Soviet Union has a severe, chronic housing
shortage, and most construction resources have been dedicated to
rebuilding the areas of Armenia devasted by the Dec. 7 earthquake.

   What better way to celebrate the
birthday of the earmuff's inventor than with a quick dip in
Clearwater Lake on the first day of winter?
   About 15 people _ some wearing earmuffs _ plunged in Wednesday
despite the bone-chilling, 34-degree water to celebrate Chester
Greenwood Day.
   The Farmington native actually was born on Dec. 4, 1858, but the
annual celebration is timed to coincide with the first day of winter.
   Donning a pair of fuzzy ear protectors, Gov. John McKernan led a
parade for the inventor. He was joined in a horse-drawn carriage by
a man playing Greenwood for the day, Clyde Ross, who was in 19th
century garb. Giant earmuffs covered the doors of cars and the ears
of ponies and dogs in keeping with the theme.
   Greenwood turned inventor as a 15-year-old after chilling his
ears while skating on the nearby Sandy River in 1873. Taking two
pieces of warm cloth and connecting them by wire, he designed the
first pair of earmuffs.

   They were pennies all right, 700,000 of
them in all, but they didn't come from heaven. They were a
retirement present to the Rev. Joseph Ryan from youngsters at his
parish grade school.
   The pennies came in plastic water jugs wrapped in Christmas paper
and were presented to the 70-year-old priest on Wednesday.
   ``I didn't take it to the bank,'' Ryan said. ``One of those water
jugs weighs 200 pounds. They'll have to get a truck.''
   The fifth-grade class at Infant Jesus of Prague Elementary School
in this Chicago suburb collected the pennies as a mathematics
project to try to visualize what 1 million of anything looks like.
   They didn't quite make it. They decided to turn the $7,000 in
pennies into a present for the priest. Principal Tom Sedor said the
pupils put on quite a show along with the presentation of pennies.
   ``They put on some skits that revolved around Father Ryan,'' he
said. ``They sang parodies of songs, substituting `penny' for a lot
of the words.''

   But 10 of them are a bit much for her neighbors, who have
circulated a petition to limit the number of Salukis who can enjoy
Wornum's hospitality. On Wednesday, they presented their complaint

   ``They howl _ they're hounds. They have 40 toenails and they run
out on the deck,'' said Peter Paul, who lives next door in the
neighborhood of $500,000 homes.
   The neighbors want Wornum's dog hobbyist permit withdrawn to
forbid her from owning more than three dogs.
   Wornum, who plans to give the dogs a videocassette recorder for
Christmas, is undaunted. ``I've accommodated them,'' she said of her
neighbors. ``I think they should get a grip on their hostility in
the spirit of the holiday season.''
   The Marin Humane Society said it will hire an independent
investigator to look into the neighbors' complaint.

   Pope John Paul II today said the ordination
of women in the Anglican Church poses ``serious obstacles'' to
relations with the Roman Catholic Church.
   In a year-end address to cardinals, the pope, speaking with
``sincere pain,'' deplored a resolution adopted by the world's
Anglican bishops in August.
   The Anglican bishops voted 423-28 with 19 abstentions to maintain
links with any of their 27 self-governing churches that consecrate a
woman bishop, even if they disagree with the practice. The measure
was a compromise to avoid dividing the Anglican Communion on the
issue.
   John Paul said the action ``poses serious obstacles to that
progress in reciprocal reconciliation, which in the course of recent
decades has arrived at such promising results.''
   The late Pope Paul VI and the late Archbishop of Canterbury
Michael Ramsey committed themselves in 1966 to the search for full
communion between Anglicans and Roman Catholics. John Paul has
reaffirmed the commitment.
   He called on the Anglicans to try to avoid the ``painful and
deplorable consequences'' to relations with the Catholic Church and
inside the Anglican Communion. He said the resolution failed to
consider the ecumenical dimensions of ordaining women priests.
   While the Church of England doesn't ordain women, some of the 27
independent provinces around the world do. In September, the Boston
diocese elected the Rev. Barbara C. Harris a bishop, and the
118-diocese U.S. Episcopal Church is expected to approve her
ordination.
   In a document issued in September, John Paul reaffirmed the Roman
Catholic Church's ban on priesthood for women.
   The pope said a second cloud over the church this year was ``the
vain attempt to ward off a schism by traditionalist Archbishop
Marcel Lefebvre.
   The Vatican excommunicated the French prelate after he
consecrated four bishops without papal approval in June. John Paul
said the church has the ``serene knowledge'' of having done all it
could do avoid the break, the first major schism in more than a
century.

<TEXT>
   China announced Thursday that it and India will
establish a group to tackle a border dispute that flared into a
brief war in 1962 and has poisoned relations between the world's
most populous nations ever since.
   The agreement was announced at the end of Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's historic visit to the Chinese capital. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing also said good will fostered by the
Gandhi visit could lead to a solution to the border issue ``in the
near future.''
   Gandhi, the first Indian head of government to visit China since
his grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954, left Beijing for the
ancient capital of Xian on Thursday following three days of talks
with Chinese leaders.
   Both sides declared the visit a triumph, and declared the
boundary question should not stand in the way of a new course of
expanded ties that will end the two countries' decades-long cold war.
   The border dispute exploded into a short war 26 years ago and has
since kept the nations apart. It was the most pressing topic in
Gandhi's talks with Premier Li Peng and other senior leaders.
   Li Zhaoxing, speaking at a news conference, said, ``thanks to the
visit the Sino-Indian history of relations now ushers in a new
period. Leaders of the two countries conducted sincere and in-depth
discussions on the border question between China and India, which
are conducive to reaching a solution on the boundary question in the
near future.''
   He said the two sides ``agreed to establish a joint working
group, which is specially devoted to the boundary question.''
   He declined comment on the makeup of the working group, but
Indian sources said it will be at the vice foreign minister level.
   China and India have held eight rounds of talks since 1981 on the
border issue, but there has been no formal structure to the
meetings, which have achieved little progress.
   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what
New Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.
India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on its
western border.
   Gandhi and the Chinese apparently did not try to negotiate the
boundary question. ``The border issue is very complicated,'' Gandhi
said Wednesday. ``We can't expect instant solutions.''
   Gandhi's trip to Beijing brings a new era of detente to
Sino-Indian relations that is likely to be followed next year by a
visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The Gorbachev visit
will formally end 30 years of political strain and distrust between
the Soviet Union and China.
   The symbolic restoration of ties dominated the Gandhi trip,
although the two sides added some substance Thursday by signing a
civil aviation agreement calling for flights between New Delhi and
Beijing and accords for cultural and technological exchanges.
   Gandhi also is to tour Shanghai before returning to New Delhi on
Friday.

<HEAD>Unusual Ocean Temperatures May Have Played Part in 1988 Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of this year's drought in the Midwest may
have been caused by ocean temperature abnormalities near the equator
in the Pacific Ocean, according to a new computer study reported
Thursday.
   Such droughts could be anticipated if the temperature
abnormalities turn out to be predictable, one of the authors said in
the report appearing in Friday's issue of Science magazine.
   The authors are Kevin E. Trenberth and Grant W. Branstator of the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., and
Phillip A. Arkin of the Climate Analysis Center of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Camp Springs, Md.
   They noted that when asked what caused the drought that hit much
of North America in 1988, meteorologists often reply ``the jet
stream was displaced northward of its usual position so that storms,
which tend to track along the path of the jet stream, were similarly
displaced northward.''
   ``Such an answer is, however, just a brief description of the
weather patterns associated with the drought but does not get at the
cause. A more satisfying response would address why the jet stream
was displaced northward,'' the team wrote.
   Their proposed answer focuses on the development in April, May
and June of drought in the Midwest, where several states recorded
less rain than at any time since 1895. By July the weather pattern
they studied was breaking up, and continuing dryness in the study
area and elsewhere probably had other causes, Arkin said.
   But during the April-June period there were alternating high and
low pressure centers across much of the northern half of the Western
Hemisphere: A high-pressure center north of Hawaii, a low in the
Gulf of Alaska, a high in central Canada extending down into the
northern Great Plains states and a low on the East Coast.
   In this period, Pacific Ocean temperatures ranged up to 5.4
degrees Fahrenheit below normal in a narrow band extending about
4,000 miles along the equator westward from the coast of South
America, with the coolest spot midway along the band.
   At the same time, a bit to the north of this band, surface
temperatures ranged up to 0.9 degrees above normal.
   When this temperature pattern was fed into the computer, the
pattern of stationary alternating high and low pressure systems was
reproduced. The below-normal equatorial temperature by itself did
not give such a result.
   ``We haven't proved anything; all we've done is shown that it's a
possibility,'' Arkin said.
   The global atmosphere is so complicated that repeated running of
a more detailed computer model would be needed to show that these
abnormal temperatures are likely to be associated with drought, he
said.
   If the model holds up, the work will be the first demonstration
of tropical sea surface temperatures affecting weather outside the
tropics in the summer, Arkin said.
   The authors took note of computer models predicting increased
frequency of drought with the buildup of the ``greenhouse effect''
global warming caused by accumulation of gases like carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.
   ``The greenhouse effect may tilt the balance such that conditions
for droughts and heat waves are more likely, but it cannot be blamed
for an individual drought,'' they said.

well as with employees of the Agency for International Development

   Many of the nation's growing number of homeless may find no room
at the shelter this Christmas, meaning home for the holidays could
be under a bridge, over a steam vent or in a cardboard box.
   Boston guarantees a bed, Arizona vows to make shelter available
by Christmas Eve, and a celebration in a heated tent is planned for
the homeless in front of the Capitol on Christmas Eve. But the
nation's capital has only 2,500 slots for the 10,000 to 15,000 with
no bed of their own.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian last month authorized counties
to continue to use armories as shelters under a program started last
year. Estimates of the number of homeless there range from 100,000
to 200,000.
   ``California may be the place of year-round sunshine in the eyes
of our Eastern friends, but when you have no roof over your head,
even a California winter can be cruel and punishing,'' Deukmejian
said.
   In New York City, the estimated number of homeless has increased
25 percent during the last year with the total estimated between
60,000 and 90,000; in Portland, Ore., the number rose 10 to 20
percent each year this decade.
   ``There's been a steady increase of about 25 percent a year that
hasn't changed in six years,'' said Keith Summa of the Coalition for
the Homeless in New York City.
   In Oklahoma City, there are an estimated 17,000 homeless and no
state or city-run shelters. In Phoenix, with 6,000 to 9,000
homeless, Mary Orton, director of Central Arizona Shelter Services,
said there are only about 1,000 beds.
   The remainder ``sleep on the streets, in parks, in their cars,
under bushes, anywhere they can,'' Ms. Orton said.
   Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford tried to make a National Guard armory
or other state buildings available for Phoenix-area homeless but was
advised she could not legally use state emergency funds to pay for
the operation.
   The governor will find some other way to make more beds available
by Christmas Eve, said Vada Manager, her press secretary.
   Christine Byrd, regional director of the National Coalition for
the Homeless in Oklahoma City said a December report from a
governor's task force put the total for the state at 35,000 and
17,000 for the city.
   Ms. Byrd said 48 percent are families, in part because of
Oklahoma's location at the nation's center. Poor families going from
the West Coast to the East or vice versa run out of gas or have car
trouble there, she said.
   The coalition estimated the number of homeless nationally at as
many as 3 million.
   Boston seems to have the distinction of being one of the few
cities where the number of homeless has not drastically increased in
the last two or three years. In both 1987 and 1988, the city's
estimate of homeless was under 3,500.
   ``Whoever needs a bed gets one,'' says Ann Maguire, executive
director of the Boston Emergency Shelter Commission. If there is no
room at one shelter, the city provides a van or police car to get
the person to a shelter with room.
   Baloney Joe's, a Portland, Ore., shelter for homeless men, is
``so full we're stacking people on top of each other,'' said Gene
Ediger of the Burnside Community Council, a private agency for the
homeless. He said the number of homeless has gone up 10 to 20
percent each year of the 1980s.
   In Philadelphia, the city has started daily cleanups of a subway
concourse where homeless people set up boxes, mattresses and
blankets. Police have not stopped homeless people from returning.
   ``Christmas is a time of enchantment, but not when you're
homeless,'' said Sister Mary Scullion, who runs a residence for
mentally ill homeless women in Philadelphia.

   U.S. checks donated in Britain to Armenia's
earthquake victims were aboard the crashed Pan Am jumbo jet, but not
a penny will be lost, a Soviet bank said Thursday.
   The thousands of dollars in checks, mainly from U.S. companies in
Britain, were being flown to the United States for clearance by U.S.
banks on Flight 103, said Ray King, deputy general manager of Moscow
Narodny Bank in London.
   ``There's no loss to the fund because we have microfilm copies of
the checks, and all the banks are cooperating in helping to clear
the checks,'' King said in a telephone interview.
   A total of about $5.4 million has been received by the bank in
cash, checks and credit card donations since the Dec. 7 disaster in
the southern Soviet republic.

   The State Department warned U.S. embassies that
a bomb threat had been made against Pan Am jetliners flying from
Frankfurt to the United States 2{ weeks before the crash of a New
York-bound flight originating in Germany, U.S. officials said today.
   In addition, a Pan American World Airways official said the
Federal Aviation Administration told the airline early this month
that Pan Am might be the target of a terrorist bombing on a route
from Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Pan Am Flight 103 crashed Wednesday in Scotland, killing all 259
people aboard and more than 20 people on the ground, and U.S. and
British officials said the plane probably exploded before the crash.
The flight originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727. Passengers and
luggage were transferred to the 747 at London's Heathrow Airport.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the State
Department notification of the embassies, but he acknowledged that
the ``public should be aware of the general threat'' as well.
   ``I think that certainly will be looked at,'' Fitzwater told
reporters. ``Public notification has to be considered.''
   Asked why there was none in this case, he said, ``I don't have an
answer on that. ... The issue is, there are so many of these
(threats) that this was determined to be the appropriate level of
notification.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said that on Dec. 5,
an inidentified caller told the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki that
sometime within the next two weeks ``an unidentified person in
Helsinki would unwittingly take the device to Frankfurt and
eventually onto the New York onto the U.S.-bound flight.''
   ``Pan Am had received notification from various sources that
there was the possibility of a threat against Pan American
Airways,'' said Pan Am spokeswoman Pam Hanlon in New York. ``We
immediately acted and put supplementary security procedures in
effect, not only at Frankfurt but at airports around the world.''
She declined to say what steps were taken.
   Ms. Hanlon said added precautions were taken at London and all
other major airports, with some given higher priority, but she
declined to say which airports were considered at most serious risk.
   She confirmed that one of the warnings came from the FAA in the
form of a memo but said ``for security reasons we do not circulate
them publicly.''
   At the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, a Dec. 13 circular from William C.
Kelly, the administrative counselor, had been posted on bulletin
boards.
   It read: ``Post (the embassy) has been notified by the Federal
Aviation Administration that on Dec. 5, 1988, an unidentified
individual telephoned a U.S. diplomatic facility in Europe and
stated that sometime within the next two weeks there would be a
bombing attempt against a Pan American aircraft flying from
Frankfurt to the United States.''
   It continued: ``The FAA reports that the reliability of the
information cannot be assessed at this point, but the appropriate
police authorities have been notified and are pursuing the matter.
Pan Am has also been notified.
   ``In view of the lack of confirmation of this information, post
leaves to the discretion of individual travelers any decisions on
altering personal travel plans or changing to another American
carrier,'' Kelly's circular said.
   Dennis Harter, spokesman for the State Department task force
assigned to deal with the crash, said today that notices such as the
one posted in Moscow had been sent to all U.S. missions around the
world.
   However, he also said such notices are routinely sent out to U.S.
embassies when word is received of threats against American targets,
and a warning of that nature ``would not have been viewed as
anything unusual.''
   Ronald Spiers, under secretary of state for management, told
Cable News Network that there were four U.S. government employees on
the plane, at least two who were assigned to the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut. He said the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, John McCarthy, would
have been on the flight had he not been delayed in Cyprus.
   One U.S. source, who spoke only under the condition of not being
further identified, said the FAA issued the warning on Dec. 5 but
cautioned that it was not in a position to evaluate the reliability
of the report.
   The FAA in recent years has issued a number of similar reports
involving potential terrorist activity involving air carriers
worldwide, but it could not be ascertained how frequent such reports
are.
   FAA spokesmen declined to comment on whether such a warning was
issued.
   Another source familiar with the warning _ officially termed an
``intelligence alert'' _ said it named no specific terrorist group
but that the threat was ``Middle East oriented.''
   A former FAA official, familiar with such warnings, said that
while they are not unusual they should be considered seriously.
   ``It's more than a hint. It's a direct request to beef up
security,'' said this former official, who asked that his identity
not be revealed. He said that the frequency of such alerts is
sporadic depending on other events in the world. At times the FAA
might issue one every few months but there also might be as many as
a half dozen in two weeks.
   A Frankfurt airport official said today that security was stepped
up at Pan Am after tips were received earlier this month that a bomb
might be smuggled aboard a jet. The official, Horst Harnstein, told
The Associated Press by telephone that the tips were about ``the
transportation of a bomb from Frankfurt heading in the direction of
the United States.''
   Enku Kebede, an employee of Pan Am who works at the airline's
office in the embassy in Moscow, said the threat apparently was
delivered to American officials in Germany and was investigated by
Germany's security service. Ms. Kebede said she learned of the
threat from the memo in the embassy, not from Pan Am.
   ``A lot of people changed their reservations from Pan Am,'' she
said. She said more than a dozen customers changed their flight
plans.
   ABC News quoted FBI sources who said the threat apparently came
from what they described as ``some kind of Islamic group.'' An FBI
spokesman contacted by The Associated Press, William Carter, refused
comment.
   In London today, an anonymous caller to the AP office in London
claimed responsibility for the crash of Flight 103 and said it was
in retaliation for the downing of an Iran Air Airbus by the U.S.
Navy cruiser Vincennes in July.
   ``We, the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution, are undertaking
this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the Iran air plane by
America a few months ago and keeping the Shah's family in America.
We are very proud,'' the male caller said, then hung up quickly. The
Navy said the Iranian plane carrying 290 people over the Persian
Gulf was mistaken for an Iranian fighter.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled today that portions of a
1952 law allowing deportation of aliens for advocating world
communism are unconstitutional because they violate immigrants'
First Amendment rights.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out a
congressional exception to a subsequent law, which gave free speech
rights to all immigrants except members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Congress, he said, already has passed sufficient laws dealing
with terrorism and his decision didn't diminish the government's
power to deport aliens for reasons unrelated to their speech.
   ``We do not minimize the government's concerns with foreign
policy or national security interests,'' Wilson said, reading his
decision in a crowded courtroom. ``Nor do we in this day and age
deny the real and lethal threat that terrorism poses for our
nation.''
   ``Our decision today, however, will not significantly deplete the
government's arsenal in combatting terrorism,'' he said.
   By invoking the McCarran-Walter provisions, he said, ``the
government is trying to stifle certain ideas from entering our
society from certain aliens.''
   ``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper,'' he
added.
   Wilson addressed both the 36-year-old McCarran-Walter Act and a
1987 statute, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The latter
act gave aliens the same First Amendment rights as citizens when it
came to deportation proceedings, but made several exceptions such as
the denial of First Amendment rights to members of the PLO.
   The four provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act which he ruled
unconstitutional provide that aliens may be deported if they
advocate or are affiliated with a group that advocates the doctrines
of world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful
destruction of property.
   The PLO exception that was struck down provided for deportation
of PLO members who advocated the same ideologies.
   The judge ruled in the case of eight immigrants who appealed
deportation proceedings begun under the McCarran-Walter Act after
they were arrested by federal agents and held without bail.

   A U.S. Air Force A-10 attack jet crashed and
burned in Britain this morning while on a routine training flight.
The Pentagon said the pilot might have ejected safely.
   It was the second crash of a Thunderbolt jet in Europe in two
weeks. Another A-10 crashed Dec. 8 in Tracy, Ariz.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, originally identified
the plane as an A-10 aircraft from the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing at
RAF Bentwaters, England. The Air Force later corrected that
statement, saying the A-10 was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter
Wing at RAF Alconbury.
   Howard said the plane ``crashed at 9:53 a.m. EST about four miles
south of St. Ives, or about 25 miles north of Cambridge.''
   ``The pilot ejected and his chute was sighted but we don't know
his status,'' Howard said.
   The aircraft was carrying ``dummy bombs and practice 33mm
ammunition,'' the spokesman said.
   He said he had no information about damage on the ground.
   The A-10, a twin-engine jet designed to support troops by killing
enemy tanks and other ground targets, is an older model plane
designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude
and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition.
   The Thunderbolt II is also one of the safest planes,
statistically, in the Air Force inventory.
   Nonetheless, today's crash comes just two weeks to the day after
another A-10 slammed into the West German city of Remscheid, killing
five and injuring dozens.
   That crash prompted the United States and its NATO allies to
agree to suspend all A-10 flights over West Germany until Jan. 2.
The suspension was ordered as German political parties and public
interest groups increased their demands for an end to low-level
flight training in Germany.
   On the same day as the crash in Remscheid, an A-10 crashed near
the heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, about 80 miles
west of Tuscon, but the pilot ejected safely.
   Howard refused today to discuss the possible cause of the crash
in England, saying the Pentagon was still awaiting initial reports
from the scene and confirmation that the pilot survived.
   The Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with
the Air Force in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but the
Air Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.
   Statistically, the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter or
attack plane currently in the inventory. The aircraft has chalked up
a major accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000
flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than
1.75 million flight hours.
   A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or
damage exceeding $500,000 to an aircraft.
   The Air Force describes the A-10 as ``a simple, effective and
survivable twin-engine jet aircraft that can be used against all
ground targets ... The aircraft has excellent maneuverability at low
air speeds and altitude and highly accurate weapons delivery.''

   Spain is rapidly turning into one of the
American farmer's richest overseas markets, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the value of U.S. farm
exports to Spain was $848 million, up 30 percent from $652 million
in 1986-87, the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said in a
report.
   Spain's gross national product, or the sum of its goods and
services, grew 5.5 percent in 1987, the highest in Europe, and is
expected to gain nearly that much in 1988, the report said.
   The surge last fiscal year put Spain among the world's top 10
markets for U.S. agricultural exports. Leading commodities included:
soybeans and soybean meal, corn and corn gluten feed, tallow, hides,
skins, walnuts, peas, beans, lentils, seeds, yellow grease, prunes
and poultry meat.
   In addition, the report said, the United States supplied all of
Spain's imported almonds and half of its imported cattle semen.

   An accountant accused of embezzling
almost $2 million from a company's health program was found hanged
in his prison cell Thursday, the Prison Service said.
   Karel Oosthuizen and his girlfriend were arrested several weeks
ago at a hotel after a guest recognized him from pictures

   Oosthuizen, 49, was to appear in court Jan. 4 to be charged in

<TEXT>
   Two skeletons at first thought to be the
remains of crime victims have turned out to be part of an ancient
Indian cemetery, a rare find on this part of Florida's Gulf Coast,
an archaeologist says.
   The site, which holds the remains of more than 20 Indians, was
discovered last week on a secluded gulf-front lot where a home was
being built.
   The remains are thought to be at least 400 and possibly as much
as 2,600 years old, said Sonny Cockrell, director and chief
archaeologist of the Warm Mineral Springs Archaeological Research
Project.
   He was called in after state investigators determined the
skeletons were historical in nature, not evidence of a crime.
   The site is in an area where Indian cemeteries are thought to be
rare, Cockrell said.
   Cockrell said the Indians _ adults, teen-agers and infants buried
in fetal positions _ appear to have belonged to a ``buffer society''
that was weaker than tribes that settled to the south and to the
north of it.
   One indication of that is a lack of ceremonial pottery, which
more advanced and wealthier societies used in burying their dead, he
said.
   For the last week, Cockrell and amateur archaeologists have been
digging on the spot with help from residents.
   ``We just found a nice tooth here a couple of minutes ago,'' said
residenet David Atwater. ``I keep saying I'm going to get a bottle
of glue and put it all together.''

   The active-duty strength of the nation's armed
forces remained static last month following major reductions imposed
in fiscal 1988, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   All told, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force reported
2,129,807 men and women on active duty as of Nov. 30, down only 298
from the Oct. 31 total.
   A year earlier, on Nov. 30, 1987, the Pentagon listed 2,174,268
uniformed personnel, or 44,461 more than on the current roster.
   The reduction was mandated in early 1988 when the Reagan
administration, facing budget cuts, decided it would rather have a
smaller military than an underequipped one. Most of the reductions
were made through changes in recruiting goals, tighter re-enlistment
standards and early-discharge incentives.
   The Navy and Marine Corps reported declines in strength during
November, while the other services reported increases.
   As of Nov. 30, the Navy said it had 585,325 men and women on
active duty, down 1,160 from Oct. 31. The Marine Corps said it had
195,937, down 924.
   The Army reported a jump in strength of 1,742 to a new total of
771,111. The Air Force said its active-duty strength climbed by 640
to 577,434 as of Nov. 30.

   President-elect George Bush will be posting
the ``Gone Fishin''' sign yet again next week as he casts for bass
at a private lake in this Montgomery suburb, aides said.
   Bush will be the guest of Ray Scott, founder of the Bass Anglers
Sportsman Society, on Thursday. The two have fished many times since
Bush met Scott during his 1980 presidential bid and eventually
tapped him to run his campaign in Alabama.
   Bush went trout fishing during the Democratic National Convention
and surf fishing after winning the election.
   Dave Precht, editor of Bassmaster magazine, said he thinks the
vice president's interest in fishing could have a positive impact on
the sport.
   ``I'm sure it will,'' he said. ``Bass fishing has been growing
over the past two decades, I believe. It can't hurt.''

   Gary Busey's move to the rehabilitation wing
of a hospital was described as a step forward in the actor's
recovery from a nearly fatal head injury in a Dec. 4 motorcycle
accident.
   ``This will be the final portion of his stay here,'' Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center spokesman Ron Wise said Wednesday. ``It is basically,
for a lack of a better term, to fine tune him. This is a step
forward. He will be working with weights.''
   Wise said Busey continues to show improvement and was in fair
condition. Doctors have not decided when to release him.
   Busey, 44, who has campaigned against laws to make motorcyclists
wear helmets, wasn't wearing one when he lost control of his
motorcycle and hit his head on a curb. Doctors said he apparently
suffered no brain damage.
   Busey has starred in such movies as ``The Buddy Holly Story,''
``Bear,'' ``Carny'' and ``Lethal Weapon.''

   A father and son scriptwriting team
are accusing Bill Cosby and the producers of ``The Cosby Show'' of
plagiarism, contending that the series used parts of their rejected
script in several episodes.
   In their federal lawsuit filed last week, Henry and Daniel Shea
of Berkley contend that a script they submitted in June 1986 was
turned down but then used in fragments over seven shows broadcast
between September 1986 and November 1987.
   Representatives for the show in New York declined comment.
   The suit asks for damages of at least $25,000.
   ``We have a line-by-line comparison of the submitted script and
the dialogue from the finished shows,'' the Sheas' attorney, Joseph
Moch, said Wednesday. ``The overlapping areas are too similar, and
occur too frequently, to be coincidence.''
   In addition to Cosby, the lawsuit names members of the NBC show's
production team, including executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom
Werner and Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint, the Harvard psychiatrist who
oversees the show's content.

   Evidence mounted Thursday that
terrorists blew up a Pan Am jumbo jet bound for New York, killing
all 259 people aboard and at least 22 in this Scottish village that
was showered with flaming debris.
   Terrorist threats that a Pan Am jet was marked for destruction
and the Boeing 747's sudden plunge from the sky Wednesday night
prompted experts to focus on sabotage.
   Britain's top anti-terrorist official joined the British-led
investigation on Thursday.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon announced that the plane's
flight data and cockpit voice recorders had been found.
   Officials said the jet jammed with Christmas travelers likely
exploded in the air before it plummeted from an altitude of 31,000
feet.
   Witnesses said the giant aircraft was bathed in flame before it
plowed into a hillside outside the southwestern Scotland village of
Lockerbie and bounced into the center of town, gutting dozens of
homes and raining burning metal onto cars.
   People living up to 70 miles away reported finding clothing and
Christmas cards hurled from the jet.
   An anonymous caller claimed Thursday that Iranians blew up the
plane in retaliation for the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iranian
airliner carrying 290 people in July. Tehran strongly denied
involvement.
   The flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, changed planes
in London and was in the air 54 minutes when it vanished from radar
screens at 7:19 p.m. (2:19 p.m. EST) on Wednesday. Authorities said
the plane was on course and weather conditions would not have
contributed to the crash.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the State Department
warned U.S. embassies about Dec. 7 about a bomb threat that had been
made two days earlier against Pan Am jetliners flying from Frankfurt.
   He said he could not explain why more people had not been
notified of the threat, and he acknowleged that ``the public should
be aware'' of such threats.
   ``I think that certainly will be looked at,'' Fitzwater told
reporters.
   No passenger list was released, but the dead included 38 Syracuse
Universty students who had been studying abroad and were returning
home for the holidays; at least six U.S. servicemen; and Bernt
Carlsson of Sweden, the U.N. commissioner for Namibia.
   The jet, which destroyed 40 houses, killed 22 people on the
ground, most of them occupants of cars pounded by wreckage, said
Desmond Park, a local official.
   The area police chief, John Boyd, said 13 adults and four
children who had been in Lockerbie when the plane crashed were
unaccounted for. Others were feared killed in five cars that were
gutted by wreckage.
   Britain's worst-ever air crash sent a wave of grief across the
country. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher sent President Reagan her
condolences and toured the devastated village of 2,500.
   Police Superintendant Angus Kennedy told a news conference
Thursday that the bodies of 150 passengers, including three
children, had been recovered.
   U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II and Scottish Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind inspected the wreckage and both said they believed
there had been an explosion in the air.
   ``The aircraft clearly experienced some form of explosion,'' said
Rifkind, the Cabinet minister responsible for Scotland.
   In July, the U.S. warship Vincennes downed an Iran Air Airbus
A300 in the Persian Gulf, saying it was thought to be a hostile
warplane.
   An anonymous man telephoned The Associated Press bureau in London
and said: ``We the guardians of the Islamic revolution are
undertaking this heroic execution in revenge of blowing the Iran Air
plane by America a few months ago and keeping the Shah's family in
America. We are very proud,'' the caller said, then hung up quickly.
   The same group had also claimed responsibility last year for a
car bombing in London that wounded Amir Hussein Amir-Parviz,
chairman of the National Movement for Iranian resistance and a
former Iranian Cabinet minister under the Shah.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi ``categorically denied any
Iranian involvement'' and expressed regret at the crash, said Iran's
official news agency.
   In Washington, a government source said the U.S. Embassy in
Helsinki, Finland, received a telephone threat about two weeks ago
from a person claiming to belong to the Abu Nidal group, a radical
Palestinian faction that has been implicated in terrorist attacks.
   The caller said a bomb would be placed aboard a Pan Am plane and
that it would be carried by a woman, said the government source, who
spoke on condiition of anonymity.
   The government source said that threat was the basis for posting
notices at U.S. embassies.
   Finland's Foreign Ministry said it had found no direct connection
between the bomb threat it received and the crash in Scotland. The
ministry confirmed the Israeli and U.S. embassies had received
several threats during the year by an Arab resident, most recently
on Dec. 5.
   The Foreign Ministry statement indicated the authorities knew the
caller's identity, and said ``the suspected phone caller has not
left Finland since he made his last threatening telephone call'' 17
days ago.
   ``In the investigation so far, no direct connection has been
found between the Arab living in Finland and the air accident in
question,'' the statement said.
   In Moscow, the U.S. Embassy last week warned American diplomats
that a bomb threat had been made against a Pan Am flight flying from
Frankfurt to the United States sometime in December. Pan Am Flight
103 originated in Frankfurt, with a different aircraft.

   In Frankfurt, the airport security chief said officials stepped
up security at Pan Am after receiving threats against the U.S.
airline earlier this month.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pam Hanlon in New York said the airline was
aware of the threat and put ``supplementary security procedures in
effect, not only at Frankfurt but airports around the world.''
   She said Pan Am received a memo from the Federal Aviation
Administration about the threat and quoted the document as saying:
``The information in this bulletin is soley for the use of U.S.
carriers and airport security personnel and may not be further
disseminated without the specific approval of the director of civil
aviation security.''
   Scotland Yard said the head of its anti-terrorism squad,
Commander George Churchill-Coleman, had taken charge of the London
end of the crash inquiry.
   ``Sabotage is the most likely explanation,'' said David Kyd,
spokesman for the International Air Transport Association in Geneva.
He said structural failure was unlikely.
   Freddie Yetman, technical secretary of the British Airline Pilots
Association, agreed. ``The possibility of structural failure is
almost too remote to be considered.''
   Federal Aviation Service records showed the 18{-year-old aircraft
had 21 mechanical defects since 1980. A Boeing spokesman said the
plane was taken out of service last year for substantial
modifications, and any structural deficiencies observed earlier
would have been corrected.
   Pratt & Whitney in East Hartford, Conn., which built the engines,
said the plane could have continued to fly even if three of its four
engines had failed.
   Ariel Merari, an Israeli terrorism expert interviewed by a
British TV network, said Iranian involvement was unlikely, given
Tehran's eagerness to improve relations with the West.
   He pointed to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a hard-line faction opposed to PLO leader
Yasser Arafat's attempts to project a moderate image.
   Merari said a ``very large terrorist team'' from that group was
rounded up in West Germany last month.
   ``They apparently had in mind exactly what happened now ...,''
Merari said. ``It is possible that another team like the one that
was caught was in the area and succeeded in carrying out its
mission.''
   Lockerbie's town hall was turned into a makeshift morgue as
firefighters recoverd bodies. Eight corpses lay covered on a nearby
golf course.
   Around Lockerbie, scorched pillows, lifejackets and fragments of
clothing lay scattered in gardens. Chunks of metal had sliced
through roofs and shattered windows in homes and cars.
   Charred dollar bills, a mud-spattered seatbelt, and tattered
copies of the Pan Am inflight magazine added to the melancholy scene.
   One large chunk of fuselage blasted a huge, blackened crater in a
village residential area.
   The jet's blue-and-white nose section, its Clipper name ``Maid of
the Seas'' clearly visible, landed three miles outside Lockerbie,
near a church in Tundergarth.

   South Africa signed an agreement Thursday
to end its 73-year control of South-West Africa and make the
continent's last colony the independent nation of Namibia in 1990.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha put his signature on the accord at
U.N. headquarters along with the foreign ministers of Cuba and
Angola, which pledge to send home 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in
Angola.
   ``By signing this agreement we have decided not to shoot it out;
we have decided to talk,'' Botha said. It calls for a one-year
transition to Namibian independence beginning April 1.
   A year of U.S.-mediated negotiations led to the agreements.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz, U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and other diplomats attended the signing.
   Missing from the ceremony was Bernt Carlsson, U.N. commissioner
for Namibia. The 50-year-old Swedish diplomat was killed Wednesday
on the Pan Am jetliner that crashed in Scotland.
   Shultz led the dignitaries in a minute of silence for Carlsson.
   After the signing ceremony, Shultz said: ``The regional
settlement concluded here today represents a momentous turning point
in the history of southern Africa. With the independence of Namibia,
Africa's last colonial question will have been resolved.''
   ``As the guns fall silent across the borders of southwestern
Africa, the world will look to the nations of that vast region to
turn to the resolution of their pressing internal matters through
peaceful means,'' he said, referring to the civil war beween
Angola's Marxist government and rebels supported by the United
States and South Africa.
   ``The governments and individuals gathered in this place have
truly given the world a special gift,'' Shultz declared.
   Angolan and South-West African rebels were not parties to the
accords, but the South-West African People's Organization said it
would honor a cease-fire.
   In Washington, President Reagan said the agreements ``promise to
end the cycle of violence which has plagued the Namibian-Angolan
border area for more than 13 years, inflicting untold human misery
and property damage.''
   Under the agreement, 3,000 Cuban soldiers are to leave Angola by
April 1 and all are to be gone by July 1, 1991. It requires half the
50,000 troops to be withdrawn by Nov. 1, 1989, when Namibians vote
for a National Assembly under U.N. supervision.
   ``All the signatories have committed themselves to a sequence of
steps necessary to achieve peace in southwestern Africa and to open
the way to independence for Namibia,'' Perez de Cuellar said after
the main agreement was signed.
   Foreign Ministers Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba and Afonso van Dunem
of Angola then signed a pact stipulating that 70 U.N. peacekeepers
will monitor the Cuban withdrawal.
   Anatoly Adamishin, Soviet deputy foreign minister for African
affairs, also attended the ceremony. He was an observer at the
negotitions and is credited with urging Cuba and Angola to show more
flexibility.
   He said the Kremlin ``is ready to continue to bring to bear all
the authority of its policy, and by practical deeds to work for the
establishment of peace and tranquillity in this area.''
   Malmierca said the United States and South Africa were the source
of conflict in the region.
   Botha, speaking later, said he was willing to join Malmierca in a
debate of Cuba's foreign and human rights policies lasting ``into
the night.''
   Shultz, who presided at the ceremony, ignored the Cuban foreign
minister's request that he be allowed to respond.
   Van Dunem urged the United States to end its support for Angolan
rebels and grant his government diplomatic recognition.
   ``If we are to fulfill our goals, without prolonging any longer
the suffering of the Angolan people, it is imperative there be no
more meddling in Angola's internal affairs.'' he said.
   Implementing the agreements will require cooperation between
Angola and Washington, he said, and ``such collaboration could
surely be facilitated by the normalization of diplomatic relations.''
   South Africa has controlled South-West Africa, a territory of
about 1.2 million people that is rich in minerals, since capturing
it from Germany in World War I. The U.N. General Assembly revoked a
League of Nations mandate in 1966 but the South Africans refused to
leave.

<HEAD>Israeli Soldier Dies of Wounds, 15 Palestinians Wounded</HEAD>

   An Israeli soldier died Thursday in a London
hospital from injuries he suffered trying to rescue a woman and her
children from a bus that was firebombed by Palestinians, the army
said.
   Also Thursday, troops shot and wounded 16 Palestinians in
scattered clashes in the occupied territories, Arab doctors said.
   The army confirmed nine wounded, and was checking further.
   The soldier's death raised to 14 the number of Israelis who have
been killed in the year-long Palestinian revolt against Israeli rule
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 333 Palestinians also have
died.
   A military spokesman identified the soldier as 19-year-old David
Deloroza of Jerusalem.
   Deloroza was transferred to a London hospital for an operation to
replace his heart and lungs, which were severely damaged from smoke
inhalation during the Oct. 31 attack by Palestinian guerrillas near
the city of Jericho.
   Deloroza tried to save Rachel Weiss, an Israeli woman who refused
to leave the burning bus without her three small children. Mrs.
Weiss and the children burned to death.
   In the biblical town of Bethlehem, activists belonging to a
communist Palestinian faction painted slogans on walls in red
warning Christians to abide by a general strike called for Christmas
Eve.
   ``Remain home on Dec. 24,'' read one slogan. ``No Christmas
celebrations, only prayers,'' said another.
   In the West Bank's largest city of Nablus, protests erupted after
the army lifted a curfew, ending six days of restrictions.
   Six people were wounded in the ensuing clashes with troops, Arab
hospital officials said.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, one man was wounded in Hebron and
another was wounded during an army raid of the village of Kfar
Kaddum near Nablus, doctors said.
   Scattered clashes also occured in the occupied Gaza Strip after
the army lifted a curfew from the territory's eight refugee camps.
Eight Palestinians were wounded, including a 9-year-old boy shot in
the abdomen, doctors said.

   Three Swiss Red Cross delegates flew home from
Cyprus on Thursday, completing an unprecedented evacuation of the
relief organization's personnel because of terrorist threats.
   Switzerland's ambassador to Lebanon also left the Middle East
nation for Cyprus on Thursday.
   Speculation grew that Palestinian radicals opposed to the PLO's
new policy toward Israel were behind the death threats against Red
Cross personnel and also behind last month's kidnapping of Peter
Winkler, the Red Cross chief delegate at Sidon in south Lebanon.
   Winkler was released Dec. 16 after being held hostage for 29
days. Foreign Minister Rene Felber said last weekend that Winkler's
captors had identified themselves as the ``Organization of Socialist
Revolution,'' a dissident Palestinian group.
   A senior official in the Foreign Ministry, Alfred Ruegg, told
Swiss radio Thursday it seemed that the same group also issued the
death threats against Winkler's colleagues in Lebanon.
   In Beirut, leaders of Lebanon's rival Moslem and Christian
governments were dismayed at the action of the International
Committee for the Red Cross.
   ``We cannot but express our regret over the evacuation,'' said
Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads the Christian military cabinet.
   Salim Hoss, prime minister of the Moslem cabinet, instructed
Lebanon's chief diplomat in Geneva, Salim Naffaa, to ``express
Lebanon's dismay and surprise at the Swiss action,'' an official
statement said.
   Michel Dufour, the chief Red Cross delegate in Lebanon, arrived
in Switzerland on a Swissair flight from Cyprus with two companions,
Michel Berger and Peter Franken.
   On an earlier ferry from Lebanon to Cyprus, they were accompanied
by Swiss Ambassador Dino Sciolli, his wife and nine other Swiss
nationals, believed to be staff from the embassy in Beirut. All
declined to talk to reporters.
   Airport officials said Sciolli did not accompany the Red Cross
delegates to Switzerland and would remain in Nicosia, Cyprus, for a
day or two before returning to Switzerland for consultations.
   Eleven other Red Cross officials arrived in Larnaca, on the south
coast of Cyprus, Wednesday and flew on to Zurich several hours later.
   It was the first evacuation because of terrorist threats in the
125-year history of the organization.
   A Swiss radio commentary said Thursday that Syrian-backed
opponents of Arafat seemed to be trying to spread doubts about his
renunciation of terrorism and to sabotage the PLO talks with the
United States, which opened last week after a 13-year ban.
   It noted that Winkler had been abducted two days after the
Palestine National Council, meeting in Algeria, declared an
independent Palestinian state and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   In Geneva last week for a special U.N. General Assembly meeting
on Palestine, Arafat followed this up with an explicit recognition
of Israel's right to exist.
   A Red Cross spokesman, Carlos Bauverd, said Wednesday that the
threats must be seen ``in the context of the situation following the
General Assembly'' but refused to elaborate.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization is an umbrella for several
groups, including Arafat's Fatah. Several PLO members, angered over
Arafat's comments, have said they would work to oust him from the
PLO leadership.
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing and
believed held hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Durable Goods Orders Expected To Keep U.S. Plants Busy in 1989</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting a0680 to fix byline</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that
orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, excluding the volatile
defense category, climbed 1.8 percent in November, a healthy
increase which economists took as a sign of continued strength in
the new year.
   When defense orders are included, total durable goods orders
edged up only 0.1 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted
$122.89 billion. That followed a giant 2.9 percent rise in October.
   The overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military orders
in October and then depressed when military orders returned to more
normal levels last month.
   Discounting the swings in defense, orders in the civilian
category climbed 1.8 percent in November, the best showing since a
5.2 percent August increase. Civilian orders had risen only 0.2
percent in October.
   Analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilian
orders, saying the orders should keep U.S. plants humming through
the first half of 1989.
   ``This was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insure
that the economy will keep growing next year,'' said Michael Evans,
head of a Washington forecasting firm.
   Analysts were particularly impressed with a 2.6 percent rise in
orders for business capital goods, which rose to $35.5 billion. This
industry is closely watched for signals of business intentions to
expand and modernize.
   It was the first increase in this category after two consecutive
monthly declines and eased fears that business investment could be
tapering off.
   ``With business investment bouncing back up, there is a lot less
reason to worry about next year,'' said David Wyss, an economist
with Data Resources Inc. ``On the whole, things look pretty good,
with strong shipments and strong orders promising continued growth.''
   The manufacturing sector has been a driving force in the economy
this year as U.S. companies have benefited from a weaker dollar
which has boosted overseas sales. The boom in exports has in turn
led to a surge in investment spending as businesses rushed to
expanded production facilities.
   For November, much of the strength in durable goods _ items
expected to last at least three years _ came from an 8.1 percent
rise in demand for electrical machinery, which climbed to $20.5
billion. Much of this increase reflected rising demand for defense
communications equipment.
   Total defense orders, however, fell by 17.6 percent to $8.81
billion following a 43.1 percent surge in October. The defense
category is highly erratic, depending on when big government
contracts are signed.
   Transportation orders fell 6.3 percent to $32.69 billion as
virtually all categories except civilian aircraft suffered setbacks.
   Orders for non-electrical machinery edged down 0.5 percent to
$21.05 billion, the third consecutive decline.
   Orders for primary metals rose 0.8 percent to $12.52 billion and
now stand 11.4 percent higher than they were a year ago.
   Shipments of durable goods increased 1 percent to $119.6 billion
in November, following a 0.3 percent advance in October.

   A bottlenose dolphin escaped from a
net and dragged a diver underwater Thursday, prompting a rescue team
to postpone efforts to move the stranded mammal to warmer waters
until after the New Year.
   Officials said they were worried about injuries to the dolphin
and to divers after spending two days trying to capture the
creature. They planned to resume the effort Jan. 4.
   Marine experts launched the rescue effort because of fears the
dolphin, which failed to migrate south for the winter, would starve
to death or catch pneumonia in the chilly waters of the Broad Bay.
   A Coast Guard helicopter stood ready to carry the dolphin to
North Carolina's Outer Banks to join other dolphins migrating south.
   Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center
in New Jersey, led more than 50 volunteers during seven hours of
rescue attempts Wednesday, and half as many when the undertaking
resumed after dawn Thursday.
   Rescuers netted the dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, but it hit the net
with such force before swimming free that a diver was caught in it
and dragged under, officials said.
   He was uninjured, but that incident and the ripping of the net on
a buoy prompted rescuers to quit around midmorning.
   ``The biggest thing is safety for both the fish and the people,''
said Robert Helfant, captain of the Virginia Beach Emergency Medical
Services dive team.
   Schoelkopf, leader of the rescue effort, said he wanted to get a
net with a smaller mesh so the 6-foot-long dolphin could not become
entangled and strangle or drown. He also said he wanted more divers
in order to make the job less dangerous.
   About a dozen people gathered on shore to watch the divers chase
the dolphin, cursing and shouting as the dolphin swam with the
encircling net. A local radio station broadcast the event live.
   ``The dolphin knows how to swim better than divers,'' said Mark
Jacobson, a volunteer rescue-squad member standing by in case a
diver was hurt.
   Among the spectators were residents who got to know the dolphin
that lingered in the bay over the summer and fall.
   Fay Edwards said the mammal often swam beside her rowboat. ``He
came along one day and I could have reached out and touched him,''
she said. ``I would really be upset if he dies.''

   Israel's rival Likud and Labor parties formed
their second successive ``national unity'' government Thursday to
meet the challenge of the more moderate PLO image and the
Palestinian declaration of independence.
   ``Developments in the international arena and challenges we are
facing require us to bridge our differences to overcome the
obstacles and dangers we face,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
the Knesset, or parliament, in an hour-long speech.
   The new 28-member Cabinet, led by Shamir of the conservative
Likud bloc, was presented to the Knesset for ceremonial approval.
Two Labor members and one from Likud abstained in protest.
   A coalition was necessary because neither major party won control
of the 120-member Knesset in the Nov. 1 election. Likud got 40
seats, the center-left Labor Party 39 and smaller parties the other
41.
   Similarly indecisive results in the 1984 election led to the
first coalition, in which the two major parties were equal partners.
This one is led by Likud.
   In his speech to the Knesset, Shamir called making peace the
``first and foremost objective.''
   He urged Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
end their year-old uprising so they and Israel can ``create
conditions for a peaceful coexistence, freedom and prosperity for
you and your children.''
   The prime minister again ruled out talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization and said negotiations should be based on the
U.S.-mediated Camp David accords of 1978, which provide for direct
talks between Israel and Jordan and the Palestinians. The PLO and
Arab nations want an international conference under U.N. sponsorship
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, who will be deputy premier and
finance minister, supports an international conference. He also has
recommended elections in the occupied territories to choose
Palestinians who would negotiate with Israel.
   Peres was foreign minister in the outgoing government, but Moshe
Arens of Likud has the portfolio in the new one. Holdovers include
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor and Industry Minister Ariel
Sharon of Likud.
   Shamir urged the United States to reverse its decision to deal
directly with the PLO after Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman,
recognized Israel and renounced terrorism.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and Shamir said
Thursday: ``According to our knowledge it has not changed its skin,
its habits, its evil charter and the terror that it uses. We still
hope the United States will reconsider its decision.''
   Foreign policy guidelines adopted by the coalition reject
establishment of a Palestinian state in the occupied lands and call
for five to eight new Jewish settlements to be built in the there in
1989.
   The coalition agreement was signed about two hours before the
Knesset session, and toasted with wine. Asked after the ceremony how
he felt, Peres said:
   ``I am not excited. I'm worried. We have problems we are not
going to be able to solve over a glass of wine.''
   He pledged to work for reform of a complicated electoral system
that favors small parties and makes coalitions necessary.

   Between the Government of the People's Republic of Angola and the
Government of the Republic of Cuba on the Conclusion of the
Internationalist Mission of the Cuban Military Continent.
   The Government of the People's Republic of Angola and the
Government of the Republic of Cuba, designated hereof as the parties.
   Considering
   _ That the implementation of Resolution 435-78 of the Security
Council of the United Nations for the independence of Namibia will
begin on 1 April.
   _ That the question of the independence of Namibia and the
gateguard of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity
of the People's Republic of Angola are intimately interconnected and
linked to peace and security in the southwest region of Africa.
   _ That on the same date of the signing of the present agreement a
Tripartite Agreement shall also be signed by the Government of the
Peoples Republic of Angola, the Government of the Republic of Cuba
and the Government of the Republic of South Africa which contain the
essential elements to achieve peace in the southwest region of
Africa,
   _ That the acceptance and strict fulfillment of the preceding
provisions eliminate the causes which motivated the request by the
Government of the People's Republic of Angola _ in legitimate use of
its rights envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter _
for the sending into Angolan teritory of a Cuban internationalist
military continent to ensure, together with the FAPLA (the Angolan
government army), its teritorial integrity and sovereignty against
the invasion and occupation of a part of its territory.
   Taking into account
   _ The agreements signed by the Government of the People's
Republic of Angola and the Republic of Cuba on 4 February 1982 and
19 March 1984, the platform of the Government of the People's
Republic of Angola adopted in November 1984 and the Protocol of
Brazzaville signed by the Governments of the People's Republic of
Angola, the Republic of Cuba and the Republic of South Africa on 13
December 1988, it is thus established.
   In Consequence
   _ That conditions have been created to begin the return home of
the Cuban military continent present in Angolan territory, after
having successfully accomplished its internationalist mission.
   Therefore the parties agree to the following:
   Article 1 _ To begin a staged redeployment to the 15th and 13th
parallels and the total withdrawal to Cuba of the continent of
approximately 50,000 troops which make up the Cuban forces in the
People's Republic of Angola, according to the paces and time frames
established by the annexed calendar, which is an integral part of
the present agreement. The total withdrawal will conclude on 1 July
1991.
   Article 2 _ The Governments of the People's Republic of Angola
and the Republic of Cuba reserve for themselves the right to modify
or alter their obligations under Article 1 of this Agreement if
blatant breach of the Tripartite Agreement occurs.
   Article 3 _ Both parties, through the secretary-general of the
United Nations, ask the Security Council to set up verification of
the redeployment and staged and total withdrawal of the Cuban troops
from the territory of the People's Republic of Angola. With this
purpose the corresponding protocol shall be established.
   Article 4 _ This Agreement shall come into force as of the
signing of the Tripartite Agreement between the Governments of the
People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba and the Republic
of South Africa.
   Signed on the 22nd day of December 1988 at the headquarters of

<HEAD>Former Headmistress Hoping For Clemency After Eight Years In Prison</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jean Harris, the school headmistress
convicted in the shooting death of her lover, Scarsdale Diet
developer Dr. Herman Tarnower, is hoping for Christmas clemency
after eight years behind bars.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo traditionally grants clemency at Christmastime
and sometimes New Year's, and friends and supporters are working
hard to make sure the 65-year-old Mrs. Harris is on the list.
   ``She tries not to think about it at all,'' said her lawyer,
Michael Kennedy. ``It's so important to her, she tries not to
concentrate on it. I think she's guardedly optimistic.''
   Mrs. Harris was convicted of murdering Tarnower, a cardiologist,
at his home in Purchase, north of New York City. Prosecutors said
she killed her lover of 14 years in a jealous rage over his romance
with a younger woman.
   The former head of the exclusive Madeira School for Girls in
McLean, Va., maintained she shot Tarnower by accident in 1980 when
he tried to stop her from committing suicide.
   Mrs. Harris, who is serving a 15-years-to-life sentence at the
Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, became eligible for clemency in
August, when she served half her minimum sentence, the unofficial
benchmark.
   Clemency commutes a sentence and allows an inmate to become
eligible for parole. Final release from prison must be granted by
the State Parole Board.
   Inmates generally have to serve their minimum term before
appearing before the Parole Board. In Mrs. Harris' case, that would
mean 1996.
   She declined a request for an interview and has not commented on
the issue. She wrote a letter applying for clemency, but it has not
been released.
   Health can be a factor in clemency approval; Mrs. Harris suffered
at least one heart attack in prison. Her age and good prison record
also may be grounds. She has been active in the Children's Center at
the prison, has taught and wrote two books.
   Cuomo's decisions on clemency are based on advice from a
three-person Executive Clemency Board, which reviews opinions from
those involved in a case. The clemency process is kept under close
wraps until a decision is announced.
   ``Each case is decided on its own merits,'' said Cuomo spokesman
Terry Lynam. ``There's no concern of public relations. If an inmate
is deserving of clemency, he or she will get it.''
   Mrs. Harris applied for clemency in 1986, but it was denied on
the ground that she had not served half her minimum sentence.
   Anne Lennox, a former professional colleague who now heads the
Jean Harris Defense Fund in Monroe, N.H., said Mrs. Harris knows to
be realistic about clemency.
   ``She's been turned down once,'' Lennox said. ``She's seen other
women in prison be turned down.''
   Last summer, Lennox's group and Harris' son began soliciting
letters and petition signatures on her behalf. As many as 10,000
letters and 25,000 signatures have been sent to Cuomo, said the son,
James Harris.
   Tarnower's sister, nieces and nephews wrote Cuomo last summer
opposing release, said the family lawyer, Roger Sirlin.
   Russell Leggett, the judge who sentenced Harris, has backed
Harris' bid for clemency. Rich Weill, a spokesman for the
Westchester County district attorney, would not say whether his
office has voiced an opinion to the governor.

   The Soviet Union and China have bought more
grain from the United States, including wheat sold to Beijing at
subsidized prices, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Moscow's order was for an additional 1 million metric tons of
corn for delivery under a recently extended supply agreement between
the two countries, the department announced. China bought 400,000
tons of wheat under the subsidy program.
   The latest sales by private exporting companies brought total
corn sold to the Soviets to almost 8.03 million tons in the
agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, U.S. corn
sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly less than 5.2 million
tons.
   Exporters are required to report foreign grain sales of 100,000
tons or more to the USDA within 24 hours. Smaller sales are reported
weekly.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1 million tons of
corn would be about 39.4 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $103 million.
   Although no wheat has yet been sold for 1988-89 delivery under
the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and
532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said seven export companies were
involved in the sale of 400,000 tons of wheat to China, some 14.7
million bushels having an estimated farm value of $58 million at
recent prices.
   The companies included: Cargill Inc., 90,000 tons; Central States
Enterprises, 40,000 tons; Nissho Iwai American Corp., 30,000 tons;
Bunge Corp., 40,000 tons; Tradigrain Inc., 50,000 tons; Tradecom
Inc., 30,000 tons; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 120,000 tons.
   Sims said the sales were part of an authorized 1 million tons of
wheat announced on Dec. 7 under the Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP. With the latest sales, China now has 210,000 tons remaining
under the authorization.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the bonuses due the seven exporters for the latest deal
averaged $23.10 per ton of wheat, or about 63 cents per bushel.

   The U.S. death rate from diabetes, the nation's
seventh-leading killer, dropped sharply during the 1970s but seems
to have stalled in recent years, the Centers for Disease Control
said Thursday.
   The mortality rate from diabetes as the primary cause of death
fell by an average of 4 percent each year from 1970 to 1979 _ from
21 such deaths per 100,000 people in 1970 to 14.9 nine years later,
the CDC said.
   The number of deaths caused by diabetes dropped from 38,324 in
1970 to 33,192 in 1979.
   But in the following six years, the mortality rate from diabetes
fell only slightly to 14.7 per 100,000 by 1985, the latest year for
which data are available. The number of deaths actually increased
somewhat, to 36,969.
   ``That's something we don't have an answer for,'' said Robert R.
German, a CDC diabetes specialist. ``After 1980, for some reason, it
appears to be leveling off.''
   The same pattern is evident in statistics on cases in which
diabetes was part of the diagnosis but not necessarily the primary
cause of death.
   The rate of diabetes-related deaths dropped from 75.7 per 100,000
people in 1970 to 57.7 in 1979, then went up to 59.1 by 1985, German
said. The number of deaths dropped from 137,241 in 1970 to 128,373
in 1979, then went up again to 148,284 in 1985.
   ``We're in the process of trying to determine what is going on,''
German said.
   Overall, the decline in mortality from diabetes may reflect two
factors, the CDC said: a trend away from listing diabetes on death
certificates, or an actual decline as a result of improved treatment
and longer survival for patients.
   Diabetes typically is present in older people; in 1980, 84
percent of diabetes patients were 45 or older, and 40 percent were
65 or older, the CDC said.
   The CDC report concerns diabetes mellitus, which is widely
referred to simply as diabetes.
   According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 11
million Americans suffer from diabetes, a disease caused by the
body's inability to produce or properly use insulin, a hormone
needed to convert sugar into energy.
   Complications from diabetes include blindness, heart and kidney
disease, nerve damage and gangrene that can cause loss of limbs.

   The Pentagon said Thursday it had scheduled new
military exercises in Honduras in 1989.
   The first of the exercises will begin in mid-January under the
code name Ahuas Tara 89 and consist of two phases _ an engineering
road-building exercise and a so-called command post exercise.
   The engineering exercise will involve 1,924 soldiers from units
based at Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Riley, Kan., the Pentagon said.
The command post exercise will involve a smaller number of troops
and will focus on a test of communications and command-and-control
networks.
   The exercise schedule will extend through mid-July, the Pentagon
added.
   ``The planning for this exercise took place last year,'' the
Pentagon said in a statement. ``The timeframe was scheduled to take
advantage of the dry season to enhance the effectiveness of the
engineering work.''

   The Justice Department is investigating a
revised joint operating agreement involving the Miami Herald and the
Miami News, a department spokesman said Thursday.
   The preliminary investigation, which was opened Wednesday, will
delve into whether there might be a violation of antitrust laws,
Justice spokesman Mark Sheehan said.
   Sheehan declined to comment when asked whether the department
would ask that the Miami News be kept open past Dec. 31. He said
there have been instances in which ``we will ask the parties to
freeze the status quo while we sort out the facts.''
   The investigation deals with possible violations of the Sherman
Antitrust Act, Sheehan said.
   The Sherman act, among other things, prohibits anti-competitive
agreements among competitors or monopolistic conduct.
   The renegotiated joint operating agreement announced in October
calls for Cox Enterprises, which owns the News, to share in the
operating profits of the Knight-Ridder-owned Miami Herald until the
year 2021 whether the News is publishing a newspaper in Miami or not.
   The amended agreement calls for Cox to receive a lower percentage
of operating profits from the Herald than it has been receiving
since the two papers engaged in a partial merger 22 years ago.
   For Knight-Ridder, the renegotiation means being relieved of
having to cover 85 percent of the News' losses through 1996. The
revised agreement calls for Miami Herald Publishing Co. to absorb
half of the News' losses in 1989 and none after that.
   A week after the renegotiation, Cox announced it would fold the
92-year-old evening News on Dec. 31 if it is unable to sell the
newspaper.
   The Herald took over advertising, circulation and printing of the
two newspapers in 1966 under a joint operating agreement. The news
and editorial operations of the two papers remained separate.
   The chairman of Cox, James Kennedy, said in a letter to the
Justice Department last month that the News, which now has a
circulation of 48,000, had sustained losses of more than $90 million
since the operating agreement was implemented. The News circulation
in 1966 was 112,000.

   Iran's prime minister on Thursday denied
there was an Iranian role in the fiery crash of a Pan Am jet, and he
expressed regret over the incident.
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi ``categorically denied any Iranian
involvement'' in the crash, said the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   Pan Am Flight 103, on its way from London to New York after
originating in Frankfurt, crashed Wednesday evening in the Scottish
village of Lockerbie.
   There were two claims of responsibilty: one from a litle-known,
supposedly pro-Iranian group and one from the Abu Nidal radical
Palestinian faction.
   An anonymous male telephoned The Associated Press in London,
identifying himself as from ``The Guardians of the Islamic
Revolution.'' He said the group had staged what he called a ``heroic
execution'' in reprisal for the downing of an Iran Air Airbus A300
by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes in July, in which 290 people were
killed.
   The Navy said the plane had been mistaken for an Iranian fighter.
   ``We are very proud,'' the caller said before hanging up.
   As far as is known, the group surfaced only once before _ last
year in London, when it claimed responsibility for a car bombing in
which an Iranian dissident leader was wounded.
   Beyond that, nothing is known of the group, and pro-Iranian
terrorists constantly change the group names they use.
   The downing of the Iranian jet raised what Iranian President Ali
Khamenei termed ``a wave of rage'' among his countrymen and howls
for revenge. The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for all-out war
against the Americans.
   But more pragmatic figures, led by Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, sought to cool tempers and turn the disaster to Iran's
political advantage.
   On July 20, the United Nations Security Council unanimously
adopted a resolution expressing ``deep distress'' over the downing _
a mild formulation aimed at avoiding a U.S. veto.
   President Reagan offered to compensate the families of the
Iranian victims as a humanitarian gesture. But the State Department
said Thursday the reparations have not been made because Washington
has rejected any scheme under which the money would be handed over
to the Iranian government. Iran insists that it handle the payments.
   It also emerged Thursday that U.S. diplomats had been warned of a
bomb threat against a Pan Am jet flying from Frankfurt to the United
States sometime in December.
   A U.S. government source in Washington said the embassy in
Helsinki received a threat earlier this month from a person claiming
to speak for Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council faction, which
has been blamed for scores of terrorist attacks over the last decade.
   In the past, Abu Nidal's renegade Palestinian group has rarely,
if ever, been known to give advance warning of its attacks, which
included the December 1985 massacres at the Rome and Vienna airports.
   But the terrorist mastermind's organization, which has bases in
Lebanon, has been expected to strike to thwart PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's peace initiative and dialogue with the United States.
   In 1974, the Palestine Liberation Organization expelled Abu
Nidal, born as Sabri al-Banna, and sentenced him to death in
absentia for trying to assassinate Arafat because of his
increasingly moderate policies.
   In Helsinki, the Foreign Ministry said it had found no direct
connection between the bomb threat and the crash. The ministry
indicated in a statement that it knew the caller, that he had made
several threats and that he had not left Finland since making his
last threat on Dec. 5.
   The U.S. Embassy in Moscow last week warned American diplomats of
the threat on a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the United States.
The warning left it to the diplomats' discretion whether to change
their travel plans.
   But despite the warning, U.S. State Department personnel
reportedly were on the plane. The Washington Post on Thursday quoted
an unidentified State Department spokesman as saying six members of
the department's Diplomatic Security Service, who were returning
from Beirut, were aboard.
   State Department spokesman Ben Justesen told The Associated Press
he could not confirm the report.
   In Nicosia, a non-American diplomatic source who refused to be
further identified said at least three Americans working at the U.S.
embassies in Cyprus and Lebanon were killed. The source quoted U.S.
Ambassador Bill K. Perrin as confirming that a U.S. Marine guard
from the embassy in Nicosia was on the plane.
   The domestic British news agency Press Association reported that
the initial information about the bomb threat had come from the
Mossad, Israel's intelligence service.

   Doctors should not give in to pressure to write
phony excuses so healthy workers can call in sick, say two
researchers.
   Dr. Marsha Cline Holleman of the Family Practice Center at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston, and her husband, Warren L. Holleman,
an assistant professor of ethics there, suggested doctors not
provide excuses unless they actually treat the patients.
   Physicians also should develop guidelines for handling requests
for school and work releases, they said.
   Until guidelines are developed, doctors ``will continue to be
placed in a compromising position _ medically, ethically, legally,
and financially _ while doing little to ameliorate the problems of
casual absenteeism,'' the Hollemans wrote in Friday's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   While the report had no figures on the number of ``casual
absentee'' cases per year, the Hollemans said earlier research
indicated casual absenteeism has been on the rise for 25 years and
may cost U.S. industry $30 billion a year.
   Workers who appear well often tell doctors they are sick, the
researchers said. In addition, they said, some employers pressure
doctors to reveal confidential information about a patient's
illnesses to get a patient back to work.
   ``The worker has few incentives to tell the truth and the
physician has few incentives to ascertain the truth,'' the Hollemans
wrote. ``The physician who questions the veracity of this worker's
claim can look forward to losing the worker's family as patients _
or, if they remain, to a strained relationship. The physician who
refuses to sign this worker's release might feel awkward about
charging a fee for the visit.''
   They said absenteeism often is triggered by workplace atmosphere,
finances, or other non-medical problems that should be dealt with by
someone other than a doctor.
   ``Asking physicians to police the problem is treating the symptom
rather than the disease,'' they wrote.
   At least one ethics professor was troubled about the idea of
strict guidelines.
   Kenneth Vaux, a professor of ethics at the University of Illinois
College of Medicine in Chicago, said doctors should retain their
traditional roles as ``protectors of the weak.''
   Guidelines allowing absence excuses only with treatment could be
aimed at generating more medical business, and workers may not be
well protected if companies hire doctors to screen patient care, he
said.
   ``We can't go to the point where a physician becomes an
instrument of societal vigilance and societal vengeance,'' Vaux said.

   Authorities said Thursday they had
been warned weeks ago that terrorists threatened to smuggle a bomb
aboard a Pan Am jet, and they defended the security arrangements at
the Frankfurt Airport.
   Airport officials said they tightened security after the threats.
Authorities also indicated a passenger would have to board an
aircraft in order to ensure that explosives-laden luggage could be
loaded on the plane.
   Questions about security at the airport and whether adequate
warnings were given about terrorist threats were raised Thursday
after a Boeing 747 crashed into a village in southwest Scotland on
Wednesday night, killing all aboard.
   Flight 103 originated on a Boeing 727 in Frankfurt. It flew to
London, where the flight is transferred to a Boeing 747. The
four-engine jumbo jet was in the air 54 minutes when it vanished
from radar screens at 7:19 p.m. (2:19 p.m. EST) on Wednesday.
   The plane had been bound for New York. Once there, it was to
continue on to Detroit, on a Boeing 727.
   The International Air Transport Association said Thursday that
sabotage was ``the most likely'' explanation for the crash in the
town of Lockerbie.
   A Hesse state official said he doubted a bomb could have been
placed aboard the flight before it took off from Frankfurt.
   ``We have no indication there was a lapse in security'' at
Frankfurt Airport, Thomas Pier, an official with the Hesse Economics
Ministry, said on the ARD-TV network Thursday. The Economics
Ministry is responsible for air traffic in Hesse state.
   Hans Neusel, state secretary at the federal Interior Ministry,
told the ARD ``we don't believe there are any soft spots in
security'' at Frankfurt airport.
   ``We do everything we can to minimize security risks,'' he said.
   Neusel indicated it would be difficult for someone to put a bomb
on board the plane at Frankfurt without boarding the aircraft
himself.
   ``No luggage would be flown for a passenger who has not appeared
for boarding,'' Neusel said in an ARD interview.
   Harald Kosel, a Pan Am spokesman in Frankfurt, indicated that it
would be unlikely for a passenger to have left the plane in London
while baggage was transferred to the Boeing 747 for the flight to
New York.
   ``I think that's out of the question,'' Kosel said. He said Pan
Am had developed a system that makes sure passengers are on board if
their luggage is on board.
   Frankfurt airport officials tightened security at Pan Am after
receiving tips earlier this month that a bomb might be smuggled
aboard one of the carrier's jets, the airport's security chief said
Thursday.
   The official, Horst Harnstein, said the tips were ``for the
transportation of a bomb from Frankfurt heading in the direction of
the United States.''
   ``There were indications in that direction,'' Harnstein said in a
telephone interview. ``As a result, we stepped up security measures
for Pan Am.''
   ``There were solid indications that it was to be Pan Am,''
Harnstein added. The International Air Transport Association said it
believed sabotage is the most likely explanation for the crash.
   ``We were struck by the similarity of this accident and the Air
India 747 that came down in June 1985'' off the Irish coast after a
bomb exploded that had been put aboard by a terrorist, said agency
spokesman David Kyd.
   U.S. government and airline industry officials acknowledged that
they received a threat in early December that Pan Am might be a
target of a terrorist attack. The Federal Aviation Administration
issued an ``intelligence alert'' on Dec. 5 warning that there might
be a bombing attempt against a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said that on that day
an anonymous caller told the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki that ``an
unidentified person in Helsinki would unwittingly take the device to
Frankfurt and eventually onto the U.S.-bound flight.''
   Another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried
by a woman.
   Ms. Oakley said the caller targeted Pan Am and told the embassy
that individuals who would provide the device have ties to Abu
Nidal, leader of a radical Palestinian faction.
   The Finnish Foreign Ministry said an Arab resident had made
several bomb threats during the year, most recently on Dec. 5, but
that ``in the investigation so far, no direct connection has been
found between the Arab living in Finland and the air accident in
question.''
   The statement said authorities knew the caller's identity and
that he had not left Finland since Dec. 5.

<HEAD>Maksoud Calls for Reopening PLO Office in Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League's representative urged the
Reagan administration on Thursday to reopen the Palestine Liberation
Organization's office in Washington and to condemn new Israeli
settlements on the West Bank as illegal.
   In a year-end meeting with reporters, Clovis Maksoud said it was
``illogical'' to keep the office closed now that the administration
had begun talks with the PLO.
   The State Department, citing involvement in terrorism by
``individuals and organizations associated with the PLO,'' had the
PLO's Washington information office shuttered last December. A
subsequent U.S. move to also close the PLO mission to the United
Nations in New York was reversed in federal court.
   Last week, Secretary of State George P. Shultz concluded chairman
Yasser Arafat had renounced terrorism. Shultz recommended the
opening of a ``substantive dialogue'' with the PLO. The first talk
was held last Friday in Tunisia.
   Maksoud said what the United States did about the PLO office and
Israeli settlements on the West Bank were the two ``litmus tests''
of American policy in the Middle East.
   He predicted President-elect Bush would be ``less ideological''
than President Reagan on the Arab-Israeli conflict and that James A.
Baker III, because of his closeness to Bush, could be the most
powerful secretary of state in history.
   However, Maksoud said he did not expect a reversal of the strong
U.S. support for Israel that characterized Reagan's two terms. The
Arab envoy said he hoped for ``a modification of American policy.''
   Looking to 1989, Maksoud said ``this is the year of challenge.
This is the year that we will see either reconciliation or
confrontation'' in the area.
   Maksoud said the opening of U.S. talks with the PLO was not a
``breakthrough'' and did not call for the ``euphoria'' expressed in
some Arab quarters.
   On the other hand, the Arab League official said, fears expressed
in Israel were ``contrived paranoia'' designed to undercut the U.S.
move.
   He said U.S. officials, meanwhile, were ``a little bit on the
defensive unecessarily'' in warning the PLO that the dialogue would
be suspended if terrorism recurs.
   Maksoud said the officials were acting ``as if they've done
something wrong, but necessary.''
   The Arab envoy began with a statement of ``deep sorrow and
regret'' that a Pan American World Airways jumbo jet had crashed in
Scotland on Wednesday, killing at least 279 people.
   An anonymous caller to The Associated Press office in London on
Thursday claimed responsibility for the crash and said it was in
retaliation for the downing of an Iranian airliner by the U.S. Navy
in July and for keeping the family of the late shah of Iran in the
United States.
   Maksoud said if the crash was not the result of malfunction ``it
has to be condemned without qualification.''
   On another subject, the Arab League representative questioned
U.S. statements that Libya was on the verge of full-scale production
of chemical weapons and that Reagan had not ruled out taking
military action.
   Maksoud said it was ``not true'' that Libya was producing
chemical weapons.
   ``This atmosphere of creating a focus on Libya as a scaepgoat may
be an attempt, directly or indirectly, by the Israelis to shift from
the central challenge of the peace offensive that the PLO and the
Arabs are undertaking,'' Maksoud said.
   He said the U.S. accusation that Libya was on the verge of
full-scale production ``might give a prior pretext for those who
want to strike at an Arab country in order to prevent the maturing
of the moderating developments that are taking place in the Arab
world as a result primarily of the Arab-PLO dialogue.''

<HEAD>Education Chief, Unions Criticize University's Plan To Run Public
Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unprecedented plan by Boston University to run
Chelsea's troubled schools deprives parents of a say in their
children's education, the state education commissioner and teachers
unions charged Thursday.
   Education Commissioner Harold Raynolds said the Chelsea School
Committee was abdicating its responsibility to run the community's
schools and depriving Chelsea residents of a role.
   ``This is a sort of modern-day tragedy,'' Reynolds said.
   The private university has proposed taking over the management
and operation of Chelsea's schools for 10 years. Schools in the
industrial city north of Boston have among the lowest test scores
and highest dropout rates in the state.
   The School Committee is the local school board in Chelsea and is
expected to endorse the takeover.
   The Massachusetts Federation of Teachers opposes the plan.
   ``The citizens ought to control their schools, the citizens ought
to determine the climate in which their children learn,'' said
Annemarie DuBois, union director. ``It is not necesssary to take the
public out of public education.''
   The plan calls for BU to raise money from private sources and use
students and faculty from its School of Education.
   Other elements in the proposal raised hackles, including the
university's request for an exemption from state open-meeting and
open-records laws and freedom from liability if students, parents or
others sue it.
   The state wants those elements revised, and an amended plan was
due Thursday. But it did not materialize.
   Peter Greer, dean of the School of Education, and university
attorney Michael Rosen said those concerns were being worked out and
a revised plan would be ready next month.
   Once the Chelsea School Committee agrees to the contract, it
still requires the Legislature's approval.
   Greer said that at a public meeting last month in Chelsea, 38 out
of 44 people spoke in favor of the plan. ``The people of Chelsea
have said `Please do this,''' he said.
   Teachers unions have questioned the constitutionality of the plan
but failed several weeks ago to persuade a judge to bar the contract
from going forward.
   About 275 Chelsea teachers are represented by the 650,000-member
American Federation of Teachers, which also opposes the plan.
   ``We delude ourselves into thinking this is a model or experiment
that could be duplicated,'' said Bella Rosenberg, assistant to
national AFT president Albert Shanker.
   This is ``a small school district that is about to become a
colony of a very large university,'' Ms. Rosenberg said.

   A woman died of injuries suffered when she went
back into her burning home Dec. 3 in a failed attempt to save her
two pet beagles.
   Mae J. Stapp, 67, died at Mercy Hospital on Wednesday of burns
over 52 percent of her body. Hardening of the arteries and diabetes
contributed to her death, said James Gregris, chief deputy coroner
for Allegheny County.
   ``According to the nephew, she wasn't burned or injured when he
took her out of the house the first time. She was safe, but couldn't
leave the dogs inside,'' said fire Capt. John Bauer. ``She tried to
save their lives and lost her own.''
   The dogs were found in the rubble of the home.

   A woman has launched a drive to save a
Minnesota man's dream of planting a tree for each of the 58,000
Americans killed and missing in the Vietnam War.
   ``We can't allow what Vietnam veterans are trying to do to be
destroyed,'' said Terry Thompson of Geoffrey Steiner's Veterans
National Living Memorial. ``Geof's forest is a symbol.''
   Thompson, who is not a veteran, started the drive to save the
100-acre memorial after she read that the land will be sold at a
foreclosure sale Jan. 4 unless about $400 in back taxes and the
$5,400 balance on a bank loan are paid off.
   Steiner, a 39-year-old Vietnam veteran, has spent eight years
planting about 35,000 trees on the land in Cushing, about 100 miles
northwest of St. Paul. Last year, Newsweek magazine cited him as one
of 50 American heros.
   Steiner said he paid $23,000 in cash for the land in 1980 after
selling his home in Minneapolis. In 1984, he used the property to
secure an $8,000 bank loan.
   Thompson, a resident of Dayton, Ohio, brought up the issue at her
local chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America, where she works as
a volunteer legislative coordinator.
   The group not only voted to donate $500 but also authorized
Thompson to send letters to 400 other chapters representing about
35,000 members.
   ``We don't have that much time,'' Thompson said Wednesday. She
said she's motivated by the belief that the forest will be good for
Vietnam veterans.
   ``The Vietnam War was a different kind of war that involved a
type of fighting that so psychologically affected the vets,'' she
said. ``These guys have to be brought out of their shells.''
   Steiner, a Marine who served in Vietnam in 1967-68 and was
wounded during the Tet offensive, said he ``felt fantastic'' when
Thompson told him about her campaign to save the forest. ``I was
ready to give up totally,'' he said.
   He said those affected by the war say they are thankful for
Washington's Vietnam Memorial but like his forest idea because it is
a living memorial.
   ``POWs can come home and walk through the forest with their
families and say somebody cared enough to plant these trees in their
honor,'' Steiner said.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,300 people swarmed into a hotel
to apply for about two dozen jobs at a coal mine this week, a
turnout a company official Thursday called a sad statement about
eastern Kentucky's economy.
   ``I'm pleased on one hand but it's kind of depressing on the
other,'' said Ed Stone, personnel director for Sidney Coal Co.
   Some applicants drove more than 100 miles to apply for the 19 to
25 jobs that should be available when Sidney Coal's mine in Pike
County reopens early next year, Stone said.
   Most of the applicants were unemployed miners from Pike County
and surrounding areas in Kentucky and West Virginia, Stone said.
   The new hires would help during a yearlong renovation of the
mine, which eventually might employ about 100 people, he said.
   The volume of applications was the largest for such a small
number of jobs Stone said he had seen in 19 years of work in the
coal industry. The positions pay a minimum of $11 per hour and
include full benefits.
   Stone said he had begun sorting through the stacks of
applications filled out Monday and Tuesday. ``I'm going to have a
very short holiday,'' he said of the task.
   Sidney Coal was a focus of a bitter three-year selective strike
by the United Mine Workers. A.T. Massey Coal Co., which owns Sidney
Coal, agreed in May to pay $4.47 million to settle a lawsuit with
the UMW.
   The settlement called for 35 union miners to go back to work for
a contractor. The strike began when two mines owned by Sidney Coal
were sold to Massey in 1984 and Massey announced the mines would
become non-union.
   Despite the past union problems, a number of the people who
showed up to apply for the openings were past or present UMW
members, including union workers laid off this year from the Scotts
Branch Mine in northern Pike County.
   The unemployment rate for Pike County was 12.1 percent in
October, according to the latest figures available.
   ``I wish we could help everybody, but unfortunately we can't,''
Stone said.

   Soldiers, civilians, secret agents and
soccer players all split an eye-popping $734 million pot Thursday in
the world's richest lottery, making Christmas much merrier for
thousands of Spaniards.
   Millions nationwide bought tickets or shares of tickets in the
wildly anticipated Yuletide drawing. The total pot _ 83 billion
pesetas _ made it the richest since King Carlos III established
Spain's first lottery in 1763.
   A ball bearing the winning first-prize number rolled out of a
chute Thursday morning while the nation tuned into television and
radios for the drawing.
   A crowd inside a Madrid auditorium roared as two boys from an
orphanage sang out the number for the $159 million first prize _
popularly called ``El Gordo,'' or ``the fat one.''
   To cope with demand this year, the state-run lottery issued 72
tickets for each of the 66,000 lottery numbers. So each ticket
holder with the winning first-place number _ 21,583 _ stands to
receive $2.2 million.
   But tickets were $219 each, and many Spaniards purchased shares
ranging as low as 87 cents, spreading the tax-free winnings around.
   The first prize was spread widely among hundreds of people who
bought tickets in Barcelona, Madrid, Lugo, Gijon and other towns
throughout Spain.
   The second prize paid $1 million to each of the 72 tickets
bearing the number 32,694. Half of those tickets were bought by
members and friends of the Avance soccer club in Alcala de Henares,
just east of the Spanish capital.
   The other half was spread among thousands of other residents of
the same town, including dozens of paratroopers and soldiers
stationed there.
   ``We're all (peseta) millionaires here,'' one smiling Alcala
paratrooper told Spanish Television as he jumped up and down.
   The $37.9 million third prize went to members of an army division
that once tried to overthrow the government.
   ``These army guys can really smell out money,'' said Gen. Juan
Anton of the Maestrazgo infantry division in eastern Valencia.
   The Maestrazgo division took an active part in a an abortive coup
attempt against the Spanish government staged by paramilitary Civil
Guards on Feb. 23, 1981.
   Each of the 72 third-prize tickets is worth get $526,315.
   At the Maestrazgo division, 116 military police, 17 intelligence
officers, 40 officers and unit chiefs and numerous soldiers shared
$10.5 million, while soldiers and civilians at the armed forces'
regional headquarters in Valencia shared another $8.4 million.
   The total value of all tickets sold was $1.5 billion, with 30
percent of that going directly into government coffers.

   The administration is ``extremely concerned''
about Libya's chemical weapons factory and hasn't ruled out using
military force against it, President Reagan's spokesman said
Thursday.
   ``The president was quite clear that military action is an
option. We're not ruling it out,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in answer to reporters' questions about a comment
Reagan made in a television interview.
   The United States ``is extremely concerned about production
facilities in Libya ... which we believe can produce enormous
quantities of chemical weapons,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked if a U.S. strike against the facility is under
consideration, the spokesman said, ``I'm not saying it's our
intention. ... We will not rule out options.''
   Reagan, in an interview taped for broadcast Thursday evening on
ABC-TV, said military action against the site has been discussed by
the United States and its allies.
   ``Well, let me say that's a decision that has not been made
yet,'' Reagan said in the interview, portions of which were
broadcast on ABC's ``World News Tonight'' Wednesday.
   `` We're in communication with our allies and with NATO forces
and all, and we're watching very closely that situation but even if
I had made a decision, I couldn't ....''
   David Brinkley, who conducted the interview, then broke in to
say: ``You wouldn't want to tell it now.''
   ``No,'' Reagan responded.
   Asked whether military action had been discussed with the allies,
the president said, ``We are discussing with them, and we want to
pin down completely so that there is no question, but that that's
what it is ... a plant that he is building and one of tremendous
size.''
   Reagan said the United States knows where the factory is, but he
did not disclose the site.
   Meantime Thursday, Libya reiterated its denial that the facility
is a chemical weapons plant and declared its ``full commitment to
all international conventions'' on such arms, the official news
agency JANA reported.
   It said that the Reagan administration's aim was to blunt the
development of Arab societies and ``to this end it will market all
the excuses it can find to mislead and trick world public opinion.''
Libya contends the plant produces pharaceuticals.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that the
United States believes the plant ``can produce enormous quantities
of chemical weapons.''
   Answering questions Thursday after announcing Cabinet
nominations, President-elect Bush said his administration also would
be committed to seeing that Libya does not develop a chemical
warfare capability.
   Bush said he hoped U.S. allies or other countries in the Middle
East could help stop development of chemical weapons, but ``very few
of them have any influence whatsoever over Mr. Gadhafi (Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi).''
   He added: ``This is is a matter of real concern to us, and yes,
we all ought to be committed to seeing that that plant not be
committed to spread further destruction.''
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's representative here, said it
was ``not true'' that Libya was producing chemical weapons.
   ``This atmosphere of creating a focus on Libya as a scaepgoat may
be an attempt, directly or indirectly, by the Israelis to shift from
the central challenge of the peace offensive that the PLO (Palestine
Liberation Organization) and the Arabs are undertaking,'' Maksoud
told reporters.
   He said the U.S. accusation ``might give a prior pretext for
those who want to strike at an Arab country in order to prevent the
maturing of the moderating developments that are taking place in the
Arab world as a result primarily of the Arab-PLO dialogue.''
   The Washington Post has quoted intelligence sources as saying the
factory is in a large complex 35 miles southwest of Tripoli. The
complex reportedly includes a plant intended to produce aerial bombs
and canisters to carry poisonous gas. The sources also said it is
guarded by Soviet-made missiles.
   A senior administration official told the Post that military
action was one of several options that had been discussed, but it
``is not under active consideration.''
   More than 100 countries will represented in Paris on Jan. 7-11 to
discuss enforcement of the 1925 Geneva Convention outlawing poison
gas and other chemical weapons. Secretary of State George Shultz
will represent the United States at the conference, which was
proposed by Reagan.
   Fitzwater said he did not know whether the option of military
force against the site will be raised at the conference, but he said
the complex ``is representative of the kind of problems'' that will
be dealt with at the meeting.
   U.S. warplanes bombed Libya in 1986 in retaliation for the
terrorist attack on a West Berlin disco where two U.S. servicemen
and a Turkish woman were killed and more than 200 soldiers and
others were injured.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
United States has been consulting for several months with its allies
in an effort to withhold from Libya the technology needed to make
the chemical weapons plant operational.
   She said Japan, West Germany and other governments had been asked
not to give Libya any help.
   Japan has assured the United States that it has stopped work on a
metallurgical plant in Libya that had been linked to the chemical
weapons plant, she said, and ``we believe they have stopped.''

<HEAD>Labor Department May Lift Final Ban on Apparel Work at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With President-elect Bush's apparent support,
the Labor Department is looking at lifting the last of its
prohibitions against industrial homework in the garment industry,
officials said Thursday.
   The department last month _ two days after Bush's election _
announced it was lifting bans on work in the home in five apparel
fields effective Jan. 8. The move potentially would cover an
estimated 50,000 to 75,000 workers.
   But in what became a major showdown within the Reagan
administration between Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin on the one
hand and officials in Bush's office and the White House budget
office on the other, the department continued the ban in the women's
apparel industry for the time being.
   The last week of October, according to Labor Department
officials, Mrs. McLaughlin received a letter from Bush saying, ``I
look forward to the next step,'' referring to women's apparel.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said in an interview Thursday she told Budget
Director Joseph Wright on Tuesday she intends to issue a notice of
proposed rulemaking and schedule hearings in February on the women's
apparel ban before leaving office next month.
   ``My intention all along was to go with a two-tier approach,''
she said. ``Because women's apparel was more controversial, the idea
was to do more of a negotiated rulemaking there after getting six or
eight months experience with the others.''
   The bans on garment industry homework were imposed 47 years ago
to combat widespread exploitation of immigrants and other low-wage
workers. Getting rid of the prohibitions has been a priority of
Reagan and Bush's vice presidential task force on deregulation for
nearly eight years.
   The administration succeeded in 1984 in removing the ban on
knitted outerwear, but unions effectively blocked the lifting of the
prohibitions in the six other fields through the courts.
   However, two days after the election, the Labor Department
published new regulations effectively allowing homework on gloves
and mittens, embroideries, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs and
some jewelry. That left only women's apparel still entirely under
the prohibitions after Jan. 8.
   The International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which represents
about 170,000 of the estimated 500,000 workers in women's apparel,
said Wednesday it will file suit next week to block the Jan. 8
regulations.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she had hoped to ``negotiate'' a rulemaking
between ILGWU President Jay Mazur and industry officials to also
remove the ban on women's apparel homework.
   However, other officials _ including Bush's counsel, C. Boyden
Gray, and former White House Budget Director James A. Miller III _
wanted apparel homework included in the proposal last month,
according to several sources.
   Gray did not return a telephone call seeking comment Thursday.
   Allan McMillan, a deputy assistant labor secretary in charge of
enforcing the homework regulations, said the department was still
looking at several options that could stretch out the time before
the ban is removed on women's apparel.
   ``Clearly, the demographics show that worker flexibility is
something we need to achieve,'' he said. ``The question is how we
balance that with effective enforcement (of federal labor
standards). It's my hope we will be able to conclude this process
fairly quickly.''
   Susan Cowell, a vice presdent of the Ladies Garment Workers, said
the union had anticipated a renewed attempt to remove the homework
ban in women's apparel.
   ``The sense we had always gotten was that Bush was very much a
part of this initiative,'' she said. ``Without a ban, there is no
hope of enforcing the Fair Labor Standards Act in this industry.''
   What makes enforcment difficult and violations of minimun wage
and other labor standards common, she said, is the mobile nature of
the industry and its domination by tens of thousands of small
contractors typically employing between 10 and 50 workers each.

<HEAD>Children Wander From House to House After Abandonment</HEAD>

   Six youngsters who scrounged for two weeks
for a place to live after being abandoned by a drug addict mother
have been split up among foster homes and friends, according to
authorities, who want to reunite them.
   ``Anytime we can help a family, we certainly will go the extra
yard to try to do that,'' said Norman Reim, a spokesman for the
state Division of Youth and Family Services. ``The goal is to get
them in a permanent home.''
   The six _ four children ages 11 to 16, two with children of their
own _ told police they wandered for a place to live after their
37-year-old mother left them.
   ``They was going from building to building, door to door,'' said
32-year-old Gabriel Rosa, the oldest daughter's boyfriend and father
of her 2-month-old son, who took the family into his one-bedroom
apartment. ``That's a shame.''
   The Camden Housing Authority had threatened to evict Rosa because
the youngsters were unauthorized to live in the apartment, he said.
   Not knowing what to do, the children called police.
   Detectives took the children to police headquarters. After
meeting Tuesday with a social worker, the family was separated.
   ``It's bad for kids to be without a home and struggling from
house to house,'' said Reim, who declined to comment specifically
about the case. ``Certainly, in this business, we've seen it all.''
   Thirteen-year-old Cassandra Wilson and her brother, James Wilson,
11, were placed in foster homes. Rosa's girlfriend, Joanne Victor,
16, and their son moved in with him. Patricia Wilson and her
7-week-old son moved in with friends at the housing project.
   Police searched for the family's mother, Sandra Wilson. The
children said their troubles began about two years ago when their
mother started smoking cocaine.
   Although the family's house was heavily damaged in a June fire,
the family continued to live there, using candles and kerosene
heaters. But after the gas was shut off for non-payment in November,
the youngsters moved out.
   They said their mother left them at the end of November, taking
her welfare check. Three days later, they said, she came back and
took $405 in cash from the family and left again.

<DATELINE>OVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Air Force pilot ejected safely from
his A-10 attack jet Thursday, just moments before it crashed into a
field, officials said.
   The pilot, Lt. Frank Cavouti of Garden City, N.Y., was ending a
training mission and approaching for a landing at the Royal Air
Force base in Alconbury, when the crash occurred, said an Air Force
spokesman.
   It was the second crash of a twin-engine Thunderbolt jet in
Europe in two weeks. A third A-10 crashed on Dec. 8 in Tracy, Ariz.
   Cavouti was being held for observation at a military hospital.
His jet crashed several miles west of this central English village
and about 60 miles north of London, said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Witnesses said it appeared the pilot was trying to miss this
village and hit the open field.
   Tony Woolsenhomes, 53, of the nearby village of Earith, said he
watched Cavouti's jet circle for about 30 minutes and ``knew it was
in trouble. It seemed to me he was circling to look for somewhere
away from the village to put the plane down.''
   The spokesman said a board of officers would investigate the
incident.
   He said Cavouti was assigned to the 10th Tactical Fighter Wing at
Alconbury. The aircraft was carrying ``dummy bombs and practice 33mm
ammunition,'' he added.
   The A-10, a jet designed to support troops by hitting enemy tanks
and other ground targets, is an older model plane designed to be
highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude and to carry a
lot of bombs and ammunition.
   Thursday's crash came two weeks after an A-10 slammed into the
West German city of Remscheid, killing five and injuring dozens.
   The Remscheid crash prompted the United States and its NATO
allies to agree to suspend all A-10 flights over West Germany until
Jan. 2. The suspension was ordered as West German political parties
and public interest groups increased their demands for an end to
low-level flight training in West Germany.
   On the same day as the Remscheid crash, an A-10 crashed near the
heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation, about 80 miles west
of Tuscon. The pilot ejected safely.
   The Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with
the Air Force in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but the
Air Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.
   Statistically, the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter or
attack plane now in the inventory.

<HEAD>FTC Charges Six Book Publishers with Illegal Price Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday issued
complaints against six of the nation's largest book publishers for
allegedly discriminating illegally against independent bookstores by
selling books at discounted prices to major chains.
   The complaints alleged that the six publishers sell books at
lower prices to large bookstore chains, including the nation's three
largest: Waldenbooks Inc., B. Dalton Bookseller and Crown Books Corp.
   The complaints were issued against Harper & Row Publishers Inc.;
The Hearst Corp. and William Morrow and Co. Inc.; Macmillan Inc.;
The Putnam Berkley Group Inc.; Random House Inc.; and Simon &
Schuster Inc.
   The complaints charged that the publishers use pricing schedules
that charge a lower price per book on large orders. They said the
publishers also treat orders placed by bookstore chains as a single
order, even if the books are shipped separately to individual chain
outlets.
   ``The chain stores therefore allegedly pay lower prices than
independent bookstores that receive shipments as large as or larger
than the shipments to individual chain outlets,'' the FTC said.
   The higher prices paid by independent stores have hurt them
financially, limiting their ability to complete with the bookstore
chains for sales to consumers and retail locations, the complaints
said.
   In response, Simon & Schuster said in a statement: ``Our pricing
practices have always been fair and have resulted in providing the
consumer with the broadest range of books at the lowest possible
price. The FTC is going to have a real fight on its hands.''
   William T. Loverd, a Random House spokesman, said the company had
not seen the complaint and could not comment on specifics. But he
said the company has been cooperating with an FTC investigation of
pricing practices of publishers and ``we are convinced that our
pricing of books is both lawful and fair.''
   Harper & Row spokeswoman Barbara Hufham said her company also
cooperated with the FTC's eight-year investigation. ``We are
convinced our trade practices are entirely proper,'' she said.
   The FTC voted 3-1 with one abstension to issue the complaints,
which begins a proceeding in which a formal hearing will be held. If
the allegations are upheld, the FTC could order the publishers to
stop the pricing practices.
   FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a dissenting statement that
the practices did not appear to violate antitrust law and probably
have not hampered competition.
   Additionally, he said, most of the price differences probably are
justified by differences in the cost of selling to different buyers,
and the publishers cited probably are responding to competition from
other publishers.

   Former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma was endorsed
Thursday by Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, a member of the
Democratic Senate leadership, in his bid to win election as the
party's national chairman.
   Breaux said Jones' candidacy gives the party a chance to ``send a
strong signal to the South and the West that these regions have not
been forgotten.'' Democratic presidential candidates have fared
poorly in those regions in the last quarter-century.
   Breaux, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,
also is a member of the Democratic National Committee and will have
a vote when the group meets in February to pick a successor to
outgoing chairman Paul Kirk.
   Other contenders for the post are party activist Ron Brown of
Washington; Michigan party chairman Richard Wiener; and former Reps.
Mike Barnes of Maryland and Jim Stanton of Ohio.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said in an interview broadcast
Thursday that some homeless people sleep on grates or on the grass
from ``their own choice'' instead of going to shelters.
   In the television interview with ABC News, Reagan also said the
possibility of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev being ousted ``has
to be considered'' although he has seen no indication of it.
   ABC's David Brinkley asked Reagan for his views on the homeless,
noting that some of them sleep in a park about 200 yards from the
Oval Office, where the interview was taped on Wednesday.
   The president responded, ``Doesn't that go back _ that there are
always going to be people _ they make it their own choice for
staying out there.''
   ``There are shelters in virtually every city and shelters here
and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to
going into one of those shelters,'' he said.
   Mitch Snyder, a nationally known advocate for the homeless who
runs a shelter in Washington, reported during a bitterly cold spell
earlier this month that people had to be turned away from shelters
already filled beyond capacity.
   Asked whether the opposition to Gorbachev in the Soviet Union was
strong enough to force him out, Reagan said that ``up until now the
government of that huge country or nation is the communist party,
which is really a tiny elite of the population of the Soviet Union.
   ``But they literally appoint, so it is possible for _ and we've
seen it in the past _ Soviet leaders to suddenly be ousted. I don't
see any indication yet or threat of that, but I think it's something
that has to be considered if you look at their past history.''
   In a portion of the interview that was broadcast on ABC's
Wednesday evening news program, Reagan said that the United States
and its allies were ``discussing'' the possibility of taking
military action to destroy a huge chemical weapons factory in Libya,
although no decision has been made.
   In the hour-long interview, the president also suggested that
``maybe our founding fathers made something of a mistake in the
method of reapportionment,'' by which state legislators redraw
congressional district lines after each census.
   ``I think that a bipartisan citizens committee representing both
parties and top-ranking citizens would perhaps do a job that would
be based on the needs of the district,'' he said, repeating
criticism that the present system is too partisan.
   The president also elaborated on his recent attack on an
interlocking ``iron triangle'' of members of Congress, the news
media and special interest groups.
   He said that ``the media, which reports on what's going on here
in this company town ... well, let me say that the incumbents have
more access to th press than some unknown newcomer ... Also, the
interests of many of these special interests, the press is aware of
and comments on and so forth.''
   On the subject of the homeless, Reagan also said that ``a large
proportion of those people'' were homeless because of changes in
laws with regard to the mentally impaired ``that they could only be
committed to an asylum or a mental hospital if they represented a
threat, a danger to others or to themselves.''
   ``And the result of that was that all across this country ...
people particularly in _ you call it retarded _ walked away from
those institutions, they wanted freedom, but they walked out to
where there was nothing for them.''
   Reagan, who told Brinkley that ``I like people. I really do,''
was asked for his views on some individuals, including former White
House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who wrote a book critical of
some of the president's working habits and of the predilection of
his wife, Nancy, for astrology.
   ``I was shocked by some of the things that he chose to say in his
book,'' he said.
   He also said that he has been frustrated by congressional
opposition to his program of aid to rebels fighting the Sandinista
regime in Nicaragua, but some lawmakers who have been to Nicaragua
``are totally on our side in getting rid of that government.''

   Two screenwriters _ one American, one
Soviet _ are betting that capitalists and communists alike can find
humor in a comedy about a U.S. businessman's efforts to open a chain
of fried chicken restaurants near Moscow.
   Jeremy Leven of Woodbridge and Valentin Chernyck have been
struggling for four weeks to overcome differences in language and
culture and create the first draft of the script to ``No Money Down
in Zagorsk.''
   Chernyck and director Alexander Pankratov, who joined the
screenwriters and their translator two weeks ago, and from Mosfilm,
the largest of 17 film studios in the Soviet Union.
   The film will tell the story of a near-bankrupt capitalist, Peter
Washington, who is induced by the Soviets to go to a village north
of Moscow to open a chain of restaurants called Chicken Heaven.
   ``It's 100 percent a comedy, but it deals with what really would
happen if an American capitalist came over to a Soviet village that
was struggling financially and was under the gun to become
profitable,'' Leven said. ``There are problems and we don't hide
them _ bad materials, materials they can't get.
   ``In the end, capitalism absolutely blows up in his
(Washington's) face,'' Leven said. Filming will begin by July, he
said.
   Chernyck won an Academy Award in 1980 for ``Moscow Does Not
Believe In Tears,'' which was voted best foreign language film.
Leven wrote the screenplay for the movie ``Creator'' and the book on
which it was based.
   Leven said outside investors will put up at least $5 million,
while the Soviets will put up at least an equivalent sum. Leven said
he has not yet lined up a major studio to distribute the film in the
United States.
   ``It should be a very extraordinary film because we want it to
play in both countries simultaneously, without changes,'' said Leven.
   Soviet studios have recently gained greater independence but
remain dependent on government financing of production and
distribution, said Vladimir Padunov, a professor at Wheaton College
in Norton, Mass., and an authority on the Soviet film industry.
   Chernyck said one difficulty in writing the screenplay was a
different in approaches to humor. ``Our jokes and humor are not so
fast as American humor. When Jeremy told us a joke, we would start
laughing after five minutes,'' he said.
   The film will be in both English and Russian, with no dubbing or
subtitles, but characters will usually speak no more than a sentence
or two, so that viewers can figure out the meaning. Much of the
humor will be visual, Leven said.
   In one scene, Leven said, the American and a Soviet counterpart
become covered in mud and are ushered into a tiny bathroom to
undress. The two are left standing naked, face-to-face.
   The Soviet, Igor, looks at Peter and shrugs to show he is
unimpressed, then says: ``America.''
   Peter looks back and shrugs, to show he, too, is unimpressed, and
says: ``Russia.''
   Igor then says in Russian, ``No big deal.''
   Peter nods back, ``No big deal.''

   Members of a nudist resort figured just about
anyone would get more use from their clothes than they do.
   So they've donated them to charity for Christmas.
   Jane Mathey, a nudist at the Willamettans camp near Marcola in
the hills of western Oregon, said most of the garments are good as

   ``Except if there are any towels in there _ they're probably all

   Last year, the deputy police chief
ordered his officers to stop telling people to have nice day.
   Now he wants them to shed their ``Dragnet'' image and put on a
happy face.
   In his New Year's message to the 39-member department, Richard
Mears said a smile ``makes people feel good, and it may even
preclude an attack of ulcers.'' A smile also can defuse a hostile
situation and comfort the distressed, he said.
   Last year's message urged officers to clean up their language and
advised them to can ``Have a nice day'' farewells, especially when
handing out tickets.
   Mears admitted he has mellowed over the years from his
``just-the-facts-ma'am'' approach to law enforcement.
   He cautioned officers, however, not to smile at inappropriate
times _ such as when ``you arrest someone you know is going to jail
for a hundred years.''
   ``Smile when irate citizens are screaming in your face, but don't
smile when seconds later you're winding the cuffs to them,'' Mears
advised.

<HEAD>Herrington: No Need to Cannibalize Warheads For Nuclear Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department should not have to
cannibalize existing nuclear weapons for their tritium, but the next
administration faces unspecified ``hard choices,'' Energy Secretary
John Herrington said Thursday.
   And cannibalization of some warheads to build or upgrade others
is something ``that we must look at to keep our options open,''
Herrington said in a speech at the National Press Club.
   But as things now stand, ``I do not anticipate the need'' to
resort to such methods.
   Tritium, used in thermonuclear weapons and as a booster in some
plutonium-powered weapons, decays rapidly and must be replenished
from time to time in bombs or warheads. Half of any amount of
tritium becomes inert helium in 12.6 years.
   Tritium has been made in three nuclear reactors at the
department's Savannah River plant in South Carolina _ reactors that
have been closed for safety upgrading since last summer or earlier.
   Herrington has said it will be spring or summer before the
reactors can be restarted, and there have been some estimates that
production could not be resumed until the end of the year.
   An advisory committee has refused to approve the department's
restart plans, and Herrington disclosed that he had accepted the
panel's recommendation in one principal area of concern.
   Piping at the three reactors will be subjected to ultrasonic
tests for cracks, he said.
   Asked after his speech how much time those examinations might add
to preparations for restarting the reactors, Herrington said: ``I
don't know. It depends on what we find.''
   The recommendation, he said, ``is reasonable, and I had pretty
much concluded myself that we ought to do it.''
   In recent weeks, cracks have been discovered on piping of two of
the reactors. A headquarters team has been in Savannah River this
week assessing the significance of those findings.
   Herrington has been granted an additional $900 million for
nuclear waste cleanup activities in the budget being submitted to
Congress next month, but the White House turned him down for $360
million more, ordering him to use unspent departmental funds to
bridge the gap.
   ``We are still working inside the department'' to figure out how
that will be done,'' he said.
   ``The amount of money being given to us is reasonable and a good
start,'' he said. ``I do not say that without saying this: There are
going to be some hard choices,'' and the Bush administration will
have to review Reagan's budget decisions.
   Herrington has estimated that $110 billion will be necessary to
clean up weapons plant waste over the next 40 years, and some other
estimates range up to $170 billion.
   Asked if the press had fallen down in not spotlighting
environmental and safety concerns before, Herrington said, ``On the
local level, the press has been extremely diligent'' in following
congressional developments, hearing testimony and congressional
reports for almost four years.
   But it probably took an unexplained power surge at one of the
Savannah River reactors last August to draw national attention, he
said.
   On civilian subjects, Herrington said it was ``an outrage'' that
the nation had two completed but unused nuclear power plants in an
area vulnerable to electricity brownouts, the Seabrook plant in New
Hampshire and the Shoreham plant on New York's Long Island.
   ``I speak as a citizen concerned about energy independence, as a
taxpayer concerned that New York is going to issue tax-free bonds to
buy the plant and tear it down.
   The plants would replace oil-burning plants, help counter the
``greenhouse effect'' global warming that results from fossil fuel
use and help reduce emissions of pollutants that cause acid rain, he
said.
   ``I think it's an outrage. I want to see those plants operate.
... I guarantee you, if we don't turn this around we will be
importing Japanese reactors.''
   The two plants have been unable to win federal approval of
emergency evacuation plans because of opposition from state
governments _ the Massachusetts government in the case of the New
Hampshire plant.
   But the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
recommended approval of a 25 percent power license for Shoreham, and
may grant a testing license to Seabrook in the next several weeks.

<HEAD>Pan Am Bomb Warning Recalls Similar Incident in 1986</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disclosure that a caller had warned that
someone would unwittingly carry a bomb aboard a Pan Am flight from
Frankfurt to New York recalled a similar incident involving an
Israeli airliner in 1986.
   Jordanian-born Nezar Hindawi was condemned on Oct. 24, 1986, to a
45-year sentence for handing booby-trapped hand baggage to his
pregnant Irish girlfriend as she prepared to board the flight on
April 17 that year.
   An El Al guard found the bomb as the woman, Ann-Marie Murphy,
passed through security. British officials said the bomb consisted
of three pounds of Czechoslovakian-made plastic explosive hidden
behind a luggage panel and likely would have killed all 375
passengers aboard the EL Al Boeing 747. Murphy told officials she
had no knowledge of the bomb, and she was not charged.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Thursday that on
Dec. 5 an anonymous caller told the U.S. Embassy in Finland that a
Pan Am flight would be bombed.
   She said ``an unidentified person in Helsinki would unwittingly
take the device to Frankfurt and eventually onto the U.S.-bound
flight.''
   However, the department's top counterterrorism official said in a
television interview that it was still not clear whether Pan Am
flight 103 had fallen victim to terrorism, and that authorities
frequently received detailed threats that turned out to be false.
   ``In fact, ever since this method was tried and thwarted on an El
Al plane in London two years ago, we've had a number of times people
come to us saying that someone in an unsuspecting way is going to
carry a bomb on a plane. So it's not unusual to have that kind of
specificity in a threat,'' L. Paul Bremer told Cable News Network.
   Mrs. Oakley said the caller told embassy officials that the
individuals who would provide the device would have ties to Abu
Nidal, leader of a radical Palestinian faction.
   Another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried
by a woman.
   The Finnish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday that an
Arab resident had made several bomb threats during the year, most
recently on Dec. 5, but that ``in the investigation so far, no
direct connection has been found between the Arab living in Finland
and the air accident in question.''
   The statement said authorities knew the caller's identity and
that he had not left Finland since Dec. 5.
   The sentence handed down in the El Al case in 1986 was the
longest ever in a British court.
   During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Hindawi
entered Britain in late January 1986 on a Syrian diplomatic passport
with a false name, and that his visa applications had been endorsed
by Syrian foreign ministry officials.
   The prosecution presented evidence that Hindawi, then 32, was
acting in concert with Syria for a group called the Jordan
Revolutionary Movement. He allegely received help from the chief of
Syrian Air Force intelligence, Gen. Mohammed Khouli, an aide to
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Murphy testified during the trial, breaking into tears and
accusing the defendant of intending to kill her and their unborn
child. The baby, a girl, was born in July.
   After the bomb was discovered, Hindawi fled to the Syrian
Embassy, where prosecutors said he met with Syrian Ambassador Loutof
Haydar. Hindawi then was taken to a Syrian safe house in London,
where Syrian Embassy employees cut and dyed his hair. However, he
fled in fear and turned himself in to police.
   The incident prompted Britain to sever diplomatic ties with Syria
and other members of the European Common Market to impose trade and
diplomatic sanctions against that nation in October 1986. The
measures were lifted the following July after Western officials
concluded that Syria had curtailed its support for terrorism.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Plenum Remarks May Be `Signal' to Solidarity</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with parliament considering
economic reforms, Solidarity adviser praising party shake-up. PICKS
UP graf 5 pvs, ``In the ...'' Edits thereafter to TRIM.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa expressed satisfaction Thursday
with Communist Party statements on apparent willingness to change
the labor union system, but said he wants Solidarity legalized
before talking with officials.
   ``It is a signal (from the party), but we are saying once again
that without Solidarity, without relegalizing Solidarity, there is
no possibility of agreement,'' Walesa told The Associated Press from
his home in Gdansk.
   At a meeting Wednesday of the party Central Committee, Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski replaced six hard-line Politburo
members with seven younger pragmatists and prominent party liberal
Stanislaw Ciosek.
   Solidarity adviser Andrzej Stelmachowski said, ``As a first step
it was a very positive one because the group of hard-liners seems to
be far weaker now than before. Therefore the climate for further
steps ... is far better.''
   In another effort to accelerate reforms, parliament Thursday
considered a package of bills that would change the Polish economy
dramatically.
   If passed, the bills will allow anyone to start a private
business, liberalize foreign investment in Poland, reform banking
and permit free exchange of zlotys for foreign currency.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula introduced the package as
the basis ``for freedom, equality and competition in the economy.''
   ``The duty of the socialist state is to assure people equal
opportunity. ... Further possibilities should depend on their
individual achievements. This is the only way one should understand
justice,'' he said.
   At the party meeting Wednesday, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski praised Walesa's recent statements and said he judged the
Solidarity leader a reliable and moderate partner for talks.
   In the clearest signal that the party may lift its seven-year ban
of the independent trade union, Rakowski told the committee to poll
local party members on Walesa and Solidarity, which was crushed by a
1981 military crackdown and outlawed the following year.
   Rakowski told them to return their answers at the 230-member
body's next session, in mid-January. ``Your answer ... will decide
about what we will do. And what we do will decide the future of
socialism in Poland,'' he said.
   However, he also asked the opposition to come to the negotiating
table without conditions.
   ``We are saying clearly that we desire together with the OPZZ
(official unions) and moderate leaders of former Solidarity to
discuss the future _ different from the present _ model of the trade
union movement.''
   Walesa said it was ``a pretty far-reaching statement and we hope
that we are thinking about the same thing. To see whether this is
so, we still have to conduct direct talks. ... We want it formulated
in a clearer manner.''
   He warned the party should ``remember that the working people are
at the limits of their endurance. Just listen to what people are
saying in the shops. What's in store for us is dangerous if we don't
solve the most significant problems.''
   Walesa said a chicken costs $6 while some people earn only $54 a
month, so ``it is a drama.''
   ``If nothing is done by spring, then we won't be able to do
anything at all,'' he said. ``The people have had enough.''
   The opposition movement has united behind Walesa's call for
legalizing Solidarity before it will take part in proposed talks on
economic reforms and greater democracy.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down Portion of McCarran-Walter Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday struck down
portions of a 1952 law allowing the government to deport aliens for
espousing anti-American beliefs, saying the provisions violate
immigrants' free-speech rights.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out an exception
to a 1987 law that recognized free speech rights for all immigrants
in deportation proceedings but members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Wilson said Congress already has passed a powerful array of laws
dealing with terrorism and his decision would not ``significantly
deplete the government's arsenal in combating terrorism.''
   The ruling came in a two-year-old case involving seven Jordanians
and a Kenyan who were arrested, held without bail and subjected to
deportation proceedings under the McCarran-Walter Act. A federal
immigration judge released them and the government eventually
dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings against all but two, although it
sought deportation of the others on technical grounds.
   A government attorney said Wilson's ruling would be appealed.
   Wilson on struck down sections of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act
providing for deportation of an alien who advocates _ or is
affiliated with a group that espouses _ world communism,
dictatorship or unlawful destruction of property.
   ``The ideological provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act do not
withstand First Amendment analysis,'' he said.
   He said the McCarthy-era statute was ``overbroad'' and could
cause deportation for something as simple as wearing a political
button.
   He cited the landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio, in
which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the government can only
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action.
   The judge also ruled that the PLO exception to the 1987 Foreign
Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and
equal protection under the law.
   ``In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas
from entering our society from certain aliens,'' the judge said.
``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only through
the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.''
   The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee had sued the
Justice Department on behalf of the immigrants, and the battle was
joined by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for
Constitutional Rights, based in New York.
   One of the original defendants, Khader Hamide, 34, called the
decision a victory for Arab and Palestinian immigrants.
   ``We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the
Palestinian issue,'' Hamide said. ``We can speak our minds on the
uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza and express our opinions
freely without the fear of being put in jail.''
   David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the
judge's ruling on the PLO exception to the 1987 law means that
``Congress cannot make politically motivated distinctions in
providing First Amendment rights to aliens.''
   Paul Hoffman, of the ACLU, noting the government's decision to
appeal, said the case would most likely be decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``When it is decided, I think it will be one of the handful of
major First Amendent cases that have ever come down in this
country's history,'' he said.

<HEAD>University Asks Kinsey Institute Director To Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indiana University has asked the
director of the Kinsey Institute, an internationally known sex
research center, to resign, the institute confirmed Thursday.
   The university requested June Reinisch's resignation in a letter
written Monday by Morton Lowengrub, dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences. Lowengrub cited concerns about the quality of research
during Reinisch's six years as director and about her management
ability.
   Reinisch said Wednesday that opponents ``have yet to come up with
one stitch of evidence to support any of their claims.''
   The institute, which was founded in 1947 by Alfred C. Kinsey, is
affiliated with and financed largely by Indiana University but is a
separately incorporated entity. University officials do not have the
authority to fire Reinisch, who reports to a 10-member institute
board.
   Lowengrub said in his letter that university officials, including
President Thomas Ehrlich, were convinced that the institute ``has
not satisfied the university's reasonable expectations with regard
to the quality of its research'' under Reinisch's leadership.
   He said the opinion was based on a review committee's study.
   Lowengrub could not be reached by telephone Thursday, and a
spokeswoman said the dean would have no comment on the Kinsey
situation.
   Five university faculty, including Lowengrub, sit on the Kinsey
board, which met Wednesday. The board issued a statement Thursday
saying it was studying the review committee report and would not
comment until it was done.
   Some board members, however, strongly supported Reinisch.
   ``I think she's doing an excellent job,'' said Kinsey trustee
Sherry Hackett, president of The Ultimate Experience Inc. of Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   Mrs. Hackett blamed the attacks on Reinisch, 45, on sex
discrimination, jealousy and ``pardon me, stupidity.''
   David Hendin, another trustee and vice president of United
Features Syndicate, which distributes Reinisch's ``The Kinsey
Report'' column, also supported Reinisch and said the criticisms
would not have surfaced had she been male.
   Eugene Eoyang, also a trustee and a professor of East Asian
languages, said in a written response to the review committee's
report that it was biased, incomplete and flawed by poor review
techniques.
   ``If June Reinisch has not spent as much time as she should have
on her research, it's because she has been promoting the institute
indefatigably in other ways,'' Eoyang wrote.
   The review committee's report said the institute was in crisis.
   ``Over the last five years, relatively little has resulted from
its endeavors, the research library and collections have continued
to deteriorate, the institute has become progressively more isolated
from the Indiana University faculty, and it has been beset by nearly
continuous personnel problems,'' the report said.
   Reinisch, a tenured professor in the university's psychology
department, said she would not comment further until the institute's
trustees finished their review of the report.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush was asked by a U.S. human
rights organization Thursday to give priority to ending apartheid in
South Africa when he attends his first economic summit of Western
leaders.
   The New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights urged the
new Bush administration to undertake ``a major diplomatic effort ...
in support of comprehensive multilateral sanctions against South
Africa.''
   It said this should be at the top of Bush's agenda at the annual
Western summit of the seven richest democracies in Paris next
spring. The other countries are France, Britain, Japan, West
Germany, Canada and Italy.
   Tougher sanctions against white-ruled South Africa were among the
main recommendations in a report advocating that the United States
take advantage of what it called ``historic opportunities (for) ...
innovative foreign policy initiatives to advance the cause of
international human rights.''
   The 54-page report has been delivered to the Bush transition
group in Washington, said the Lawyers Committee, a public interest
law center working to promote international human rights and
protection of refugees. It is headed by former federal Judge Marvin
E. Frankel.
   Other recommendations:
   _Continued linkage between U.S. trade concessions and the right
of people to leave the Soviet Union, with consideration for a
one-year grant of such concessions if the emigration rate continues
to rise and Soviet exit procedures are relaxed.
   _A ban on the use of U.S. anti-terrorism aid funds for training
foreign police against insurgent forces.
   _Support of legislation narrowing the grounds for exclusion or
deportation of immigrants or U.S. visitors on the basis of beliefs,
affiliations or activities protected by the constitution for
American citizens.
   _Liberalized standards for U.S. political asylum.
   _Requiring the Soviet Union to end screening of foreign
journalists' reporting and to guarantee access to non-government and
private groups before U.S. agreement to a Soviet-proposed 1991
humanitarian conference in Moscow.
   _U.S. support for the creation of human rights departments in the
multilateral development banks.
   _Creation of a new senior position of undersecretary of state for
human rights.

   Suspicion has focused on terrorist sabotage as the cause of

five air disasters involving bombs over the past 12 years:

   Korean Air Flight 858 disappears over the jungle near the
Thailand-Burma border. All 115 people aboard the Boeing 707 are
killed.
   Suspicion about a planted bomb focused on two passengers, a man
and woman, detained after they were questioned about forged Japanese
passports and bit into cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters.
The couple had left the KAL flight, which was bound from Baghdad to
Bangkok, in Abu Dhabi, one stop before it disappeared. The man
succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman survived.
   South Korean officials believe the couple left bags on the plane
that contained a bomb, and suggested they were North Korean agents
who blew up the plane as part of a long-range scheme to disrupt the
1988 Seoul Summer Olympics. North Korea called the accusation
``silly and far-fetched.''

   Four Americans are killed when a bomb under a seat explodes on
Trans World Airlines Flight 840 from Rome to Athens. Nine other
passengers are injured.
   The Boeing 727 was beginning its descent into Athens when the
bomb blew a gaping hole in the fuselage. Two women, a mother and
daughter, and the daughter's baby were killed when they were sucked
from the plane and plummeted to the ground. The fourth victim, also
found on the ground, was killed instantly when the bomb exploded
under his seat.
   Authorities speculated that the terrorist who set the charge may
have been confused by Italy's recent shift to daylight-saving time.
Had the bomb gone off an hour earlier _ before the jet began its
descent _ the massive decompression of the fuselage would have
caused a crash killing all 122 people aboard.
   Police said the explosive device was left under the seat by a
woman carrying a Lebanese passport under the name Mei Mansour who
sat in the seat earlier, when the plane was westbound. Mansour later
appeared in Beirut and denied responsibility.

   Air-India Flight 182 blows apart off the coast of Ireland,
killing all 329 people aboard. The Boeing 747 was on its way from
Toronto to Bombay, via London.
   An inquiry by the Indian government concluded that a bomb caused
the crash.
   Canadian authorities said a man checked a suitcase onto the plane
but did not board. In another incident the same day, Canadian
officials say, Sikh militants planted a suitcase bomb on a Canadian
jetliner in Vancouver. The bag exploded while being transferred to
an Air-India flight at the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage
handlers.
   Despite circumstantial evidence, police have been unable to prove
their contention that extremist Sikhs based in British Columbia
planted the bombs to retaliate for the storming of a Sikh shrine in
India by government troops. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility
for the crash on behalf of Sikh groups.

   A 16-year-old Japanese boy is killed by a bomb that explodes
aboard a Pan Am jetliner bound from Tokyo to Hawaii. Fifteen other
passengers, including the boy's parents, are injured.
   The plane, carrying 285 people, landed safely despite the
explosion, which occurred about 140 miles out from Hawaii. No
individual or group claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   In May 1988, a Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested at
Athens airport, on a tip from the U.S. Embassy in the Greek capital,
and charged with planting the bomb aboard the trans-Pacific
airliner. American officials have said Rashid also was involved in
the 1986 TWA bombing.
   His extradition to the United States remains under consideration.

   A Cubana Airlines DC8 crashes into the sea minutes after taking
off from Seawell Airport in Barbados, killing 73 people, including
24 members of the Cuban national fencing team.
   Nine minutes after takeoff, the pilot contacted the control
tower: ``Seawell, Seawell, C0455. We have an explosion on board.
We're descending fast. ... We have fire on board. ... Request
immediate landing permission.'' Another explosion went off and the
pilot was heard shouting, ``Shut the door!'' The plane hit the ocean
several miles offshore.
   Four Cuban exiles living in Venezuela were charged with the
bombing. Two were convicted, one escaped, and a fourth, anti-Castro
radical Orlando Bosch, spent 11 years in Venezuelan prisons while
fighting the charges, was never convicted, and finally was released
and returned to the United States last February.

   Pope John Paul II is receptive to a meeting
with Yasser Arafat if it can be arranged when the PLO chairman
visits Rome on Friday, Vatican sources said.
   There has been no official confirmation of a Vatican audience,
but Italian news reports said Thursday the Palestine Liberation
Organization's Rome office had requested one.
   The Vatican sources, speaking privately, noted that John Paul
granted Arafat an audience in 1982 and Vatican officials met with a
ranking PLO official, Farouk Kaddoumi, last February.
   Israel and Jewish groups condemned the 1982 audience. In an
account of the meeting, the Vatican said the pope called for a
Palestinian homeland, respect for Israel's security and an end to
terrorism.
   Arafat is touring Europe seeking support for an international
Middle East peace conference and the independent Palestinian state
proclaimed Nov. 15.
   In Yugoslavia, which Arafat visited Wednesday, the official news
agency Tanjug said Thursday the ``state of Palestine'' would
establish an embassy in Belgrade. It is believed the PLO mission in
Belgrade will be elevated to embassy level with an ambassador in
charge.
   Italian officials have said Arafat will meet with Premier Ciriaco
De Mita and Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti on Friday.
   Italy is the first NATO member on Arafat's European itinerary. He
conferred with Andreotti during a stopover in Rome on Nov. 2.

   Rebels stabbed an unarmed guard to
death at a government lawmaker's home after setting the house ablaze
in postelection violence, a police spokesman said Thursday.
   Rebels of the People's Liberation Front, the main Sinhalese
extremist group, also burned two post offices in Matara, said the
spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing regulation.
   The attacks Wednesday followed Prime Minister Ranasinghe
Premadasa's victory in Monday's presidential election. Premadasa, of
the governing United National Party, defeated Sirimavo Bandaranaike
of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
   The raiders attacked the home of Dayananda Wickremasinghe near
Matara, 85 miles south of Colombo. Wickremasinghe was not at home.
   When house guard R. Vedamataya tried to intervene, he was stabbed
and his body set on fire, the spokeseman said.
   Sinhalese militants were accused of killing more than 430 people
in the past month in trying to disrupt the presidential polls and
were blamed for 15 additional deaths on election day.
   The Front had called for an election boycott. It says the
government conceded too much in a July 1987 peace accord aimed at
ending the 5-year-old insurrection by separatist guerrillas from the
minority Tamil community.
   Sinhalese form 75 percent of the island's 16 million people.
Tamils make up 18 percent and accuse the Sinhalese of discriminating
against them in jobs and education.
   The Sun newspaper quoted Premadasa on Thursday as saying he has
given Sinhalese militants 10 days to give up violence and join in
the democratic process.
   ``Please make up your mind soon. You have another chance of
joining the democratic process at the forthcoming parliamentary
elections,'' Premadasa was quoted as saying. ``I am available for
any consultation with a view to arriving at a practical solution.''
   Premadasa will be sworn in as president Jan. 2. General elections
are scheduled for Feb. 15.

   The four-party Working Commission on Cambodia met
Thursday to discuss withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the crux of a
five-point plan proposed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, unofficial
leader of the rebel movement.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, guerrilla leaders and officials of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations ended a two-day meeting to
prepare for peace talks with Vietnam. Thailand, Indonesia, the
Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei are members of the
regional organization.
   Li Zhaoxing, a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, said in
Beijing ``it is imperative for Vietnam to show its sincerity,'' by
pulling out, and repeated China's demand for international
supervision of the withdrawal.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and has said it will
remove all occupation forces by 1990. It claims to have taken out
50,000 soldiers this year, which it says is half the total, but
China and other nations say most of the withdrawals were merely
troop rotations.
   The Working Commission was formed last month to seek a political
solution. It includes representatives of the government Vietnam
installed in Phnom Penh, the capital; the Khmer Rouge, whose
government the invaders overthrew, and guerrilla groups led by
Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, and by Son Sann.
   Cambodian government delegate Hor Nam Hong demanded at the
Thursday meeting that Sihanouk's plan include an end to guerrilla
activity, an idea opposed by the Khmer Rouge and the other two rebel
groups. The plan now provides for a withdrawal timetable accompanied
by dismantling of the Vietnamese client government and the Khmer
Rouge exile regime.
   Sihanouk also has rejected Hong's proposal that subcommittees be
created to examine the plan in detail.
   The session ended after Hong withdrew to consult with his
government and no date was set for the next meeting.

   The Gulf Cooperation Council ended a
summit meeting Thursday, pledging to consolidate the Iran-Iraq peace
drive, safeguard freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf and seek
an international conference on the Palestinian question.
   The six member nations endorsed Saudi-sponsored talks between the
Soviet Union and Afghan rebels amid speculation that oil giant Saudi
Arabia was moving toward resuming diplomatic ties with Moscow after
a 50-year break.
   Attending the four-day summit were King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,
Sultan Qaboos of Oman, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait,
Sheik Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al
Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates and Sheik Isa bin Salman Al
Khalifa of Bahrain.
   They stressed their resolve to strengthen collective defense
capabilities and boosted economic integration plans with a ``Manama
Declaration'' calling for speeded-up efforts toward a gulf common
market.
   In a closing communique read by council Secretary-General
Abdullah Bishara of Kuwait, the group said it backed efforts by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to promote a peace treaty
between Iran and Iraq to formally end their 8-year-old war. Iran and
Iraq agreed to a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in August.
   The summit appealed for world support for an international
conference on the Palestinian question to pave the way for a lasting
Arab-Israeli peace and an independent Palestinian state. It said the
Palestine Liberation Organization must take part in such a
conference.
   The Gulf Cooperation Council was formed mainly as an economic
alliance eight months after the gulf war broke out in September
1980. But the conflict prompted efforts for military integration as
well.
   Among steps approved by the council in its drive for a gulf
common market was one entitling a citizen of any member nation to
own shares in companies in another member country.
   The six leaders requested an Arab League foreign ministers'
conference in a new push to end Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.
   They expressed support for Egypt's reinstatement into the
22-member Arab League, nearly a decade after Egypt's membership was
suspended to protest its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.
   The leaders pledged to abide by oil production quotas agreed by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in November, to
take effect Jan.1, and urged other OPEC member states to observe
their quotas.
   Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait belong to the
13-member cartel. Bahrain and Oman do not, but all six depend on oil
revenues.
   The summit ``affirmed the necessity of cooperation between OPEC
and other oil producers outside the organization, considering that
stability of (oil) prices in a collective responsibility.''
   Runaway overproduction by some OPEC members in recent months has
driven oil prices below OPEC's benchmark level of $18 a barrel.

   Christmas lights went out Thursday night,
and anguished Syracuse University students hugged at memorial
services to ``embrace the pain'' of losing 35 classmates in the
crash of a Pan Am jumbo jet.
   ``I don't know how to describe it when somebody dies. It hurts
and you can't help,'' said Lisa M. Blake, a sophomore from
Baldwinsville, N.Y. ``I want to bring them back.''
   The Syracuse students were among 258 people who died when the New
York-bound Boeing 747 crashed into dozens of homes in the Scottish
village of Lockerbie Wednesday night, killing another 22 people on
the ground. Authorities are investigating the possibility that a
terrorist group planted a bomb aboard the jetliner.
   Syracuse Mayor Tom Young ordered the city's Christmas lights
turned off Thursday night in memory of the crash victims and asked
residents to do the same.
   Two memorial services were held Thursday at Hendricks Memorial
Chapel for students and faculty. A prayer vigil was held Wednesday
night that drew more than 600 people, and 25,000 people attending a
university basketball game paused for a minute of silence and a
brief prayer.
   At one of Thursday's services many participants had red, puffy
eyes and few failed to join in the hugging after the service.
   ``The only way to look forward is to embrace the pain and
acknowledge it as a part of life,'' drama professor Geri Clark said
as she emerged from the chapel.
   ``If you avoid the pain, it goes inside and it destroys you,''
said Clark, who knew several students killed in the crash.
   At one service, Rev. Paul Kowalewski told about 400 people they
were not alone in their grief.
   ``When one person dies we are all diminished. It is like when a
finger is severed, the whole body hurts,'' said Kowalewski, the
university's Protestant chaplain.
   ``You can be consoled because Christ is crying with us. Christ
grieves, too,'' he said.
   English instructor Donna Marsh sat teary-eyed over a stack of
graded final exams she was returning to students.
   ``It's just horrible. I'm fine but I feel horrible for the
parents and the families,'' said Marsh, who taught a composition
course to Kesha Weedon, one of the victims.
   The university tried to take a business-as-usual approach and
finish the final two days of examinations before recessing for a
three-week holiday break.
   University Chancellor Melvin Eggers issued a memo to faculty
asking them to be ``sensitive and understanding'' to students too
distraught to take their tests.
   ``They will be given exams only if they are prepared,'' said
Eggers.
   Marsh and Clark said none of their students had asked for
additional time for their final exams.
   ``I don't know how anyone could keep their mind focused now,''
said Mike Gacek, a senior from Bristol, Conn., who finished his
exams Wednesday and later learned a fraternity brother was on board
Flight 103.
   Gacek said he was staying away from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house
because it was ``a pit of sorrow.''

   President Reagan, described as ``deeply
saddened'' by the Pan Am jumbo jet crash in Scotland, offered
condolences to the bereaved and help in the investigation Thursday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan was briefed on
the crash by his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L.
Powell, shortly after the plane went down on Wednesday.
   He said the president was continuing to receive updated reports
on the crash of the flight from London to New York that killed all
258 people aboard and at least 22 others on the ground.
   ``President Reagan is deeply saddened by this tragic accident,''
Fitzwater said. ``The president and Mrs. Reagan want to convey
condolences to the families of all the victims.''
   ``The president has promised the full cooperation and support of
the U.S. government in the investigation,'' he added.
   The National Transportation and Safety Board sent four
investigators and the Federal Aviation Administration sent three
observers to Britain, but FAA spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane said the
investigation, including examination of the ``black box'' flight
recorder, would be led by British agencies.
   The NTSB investigators included an expert on fire damage and a
metallurgist.
   The Justice Department also announced it offered the services of
the FBI's forensics and disaster units in the crash investigation.
The offer of assistance was being made through L. Paul Bremer, head
of the State Department's counterterrorism office, said Justice
Department spokesman Loye Miller.
   FBI Director William Sessions, speaking with reporters in San
Francisco, said he had reports of ``a number of calls taking
credit'' for the disaster. Some callers claimed association with
terrorist organizations, Sessions said.
   Sessions said FBI bomb experts will visit the crash site
``promptly'' and assist with a technical investigation at Scotland
Yard as well.
   Authority for the FBI action, Sessions said, comes from federal
law allowing investigation abroad in cases of destruction of U.S.
aircraft or when Americans might be victims of terrorism.
   Fitzwater said the president telephoned British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and told her: ``On behalf of the American people,
I want to thank the rescue workers who responded so quickly and
graciously. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this
accident, both the passengers on the plane and the villagers in
Scotland, and with their loved ones.''
   Reagan spoke with Mrs. Thatcher shortly after she completed a
visit to the crash site near the English-Scottish border, Fitzwater
said.
   Under questioning, Fitzwater defended the process by which the
State Department warned U.S. embassies that a bomb threat had been
made earlier this month against Pan Am jetliners flying from
Frankfurt to the United States.
   He said he could not explain why more people had not been
notified of the threat, however, and acknowledged that ``the public
should be aware'' of such threats.
   ``I think that certainly will be looked at,'' Fitzwater said.
``Public notification has to be considered.''
   President-elect Bush said that if there was ``hard evidence''
that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not
be averted, the public should be warned.
   But Bush, answering questions after announcing appointments to
his administration, warned against giving ``undue attention to what
the terrorist wants to call attention to.''
   ``So often its best to handle these matters by aborting a
threat,'' Bush said.
   ``You've got to evaluate the threat, and I've found with some
experience in the intelligence business enormous numbers of
suggestions that there is going to be some terroristic action and
most of them never materialize,'' said Bush, a former director of
the CIA.

   The Federal Aviation Administration cannot run
mock weapons through foreign airports to test security, as it does
in the United States, but it can do more to help make the airports
safer, a congressional study said Thursday.
   The study was made public by the General Accounting Office was
released a day after a U.S.-bound Pan American World Airways
jetliner exploded and crashed in Scotland, killing all 258 people
aboard and at least 22 people on the ground.
   Investigators were focusing on a telephoned threat made against
flights on the route two weeks ago.
   The FAA, which has imposed fines totaling $2.6 million against
dozens of U.S. airlines for safety lapses over the last six months,
uses undercover agents to smuggle fake weaponry aboard planes at
American airports. But it conducts far less aggressive inspections
abroad.
   The agency, in a report released last year, said that 20 percent
of mock weapons and bombs smuggled onto planes at U.S. airports went
undetected, with results varying widely among the 28 airports
checked. FAA officials say more of the fake weapons are now spotted
by improved airport security.
   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, agreed with the FAA
that it could not conduct such testing at foreign airports because
``of sovereignty concerns and possible danger to inspectors.''
   Kenneth M. Mead, GAO associate director, said the study looked
into FAA inspections at five foreign airports considered likely
terrorist targets. He declined to identify them but said they did
not include either Frankfurt or London.
   Mead said the study was not released because of the Pan Am crash
but had been scheduled for release Thursday, 15 days after it was
sent to the House subcommittee on government activities and
transportation, which requested it.
   Raymond Salazar, FAA director of security, said the report was
``fairly complimentary'' of what the agency was doing abroad, but he
conceded it identified areas that need more attention.
   FAA inspectors check foreign airports with on-sight inspections
and interviews with local officials, the study said. It recommended
that the aviation agency require its inspectors to analyze tests
conducted by foreign officials at their own airports.
   ``We believe the FAA could enhance the overall security
assessment process by requiring inspectors to make some analysis of
host country test results,'' the report said.
   It also said the FAA has failed to notify the State Department of
training needed for foreign airport personnel under the
Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program. In fiscal 1987, the program
trained 3,000 people in 46 countries and provided $2.8 million worth
of equipment to 18 countries, according to the report.
   The FAA uses two-person teams to inspect foreign airports,
spending from three to five days at each, depending on the airport's
size.
   A 1985 law requires the secretary of transportation to notify a
foreign country when the FAA concludes that security is lax at one
of its airports.
   In 600 inspections of 200 airports during 1986 and 1987, the FAA
found only two occasions where the country had to be formally
notified that it was not meeting international standards, the report
said.
   In 1986, the secretary issued public notice that the Manila
International Airport was unsafe. At the other airport, which was
not identified, safety was upgraded within 90 days and no public
notice was given, the report said.

   As investigators centered on sabotage as the
cause of a Pan Am jumbo jet disaster, aviation experts said Thursday
a crash could be caused by a relatively small bomb if the blast
damages a plane's sensitive control systems.
   ``Depending on where a bomb is placed, even a relatively small
explosive device can fatally cripple an aircraft. We're not talking
about the kinds of explosive force you would need to cripple a
tank,'' said John Mazor, a spokesman for the private Air Line Pilots
Association.
   Kenneth Plunkett, a representative of the Aviation Safety
Institute, agreed, noting that ``it's not the size of the bomb, it's
where it is placed.''
   Both Mazor and Plunkett stressed that they had no first-hand
details about what caused the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland
Wednesday. All 258 people aboard the Boeing 747 jetliner were
killed, along with 22 people on the ground in the village of
Lockerbie.
   The New York-bound flight had originated in West Germany and U.S.
officials said Thursday that American embassies had issued travel
warnings about a recent threat that a Pan Am Frankfurt-to-New York
plane would be the target of a bomb.
   Aviation experts noted that the widely scattered wreckage,
witness reports of a flash of light from the jet when at a high
altitude and its sudden disappearance from radar at 31,000 feet all
tend to support the sabotage theory.
   Mazor said aircraft in flight are extremely vulnerable.
   ``Aircraft have to be designed to balance the two considerations
of structural strength versus weight,'' he said. ``Even an aircraft
designed to structural standards which are well above adequate for
normal flying operations and minor problems is not going to be
anywhere near strong enough to withhstand the effects of any
decent-sized explosive device. They just aren't made to withstand
that kind of thing.''
   ``You don't even have to blow off a major piece of the aircraft's
structure to cripple it,'' said Mazor. ``If a bomb severs some major
or important electrical wiring, or hydraulic lines or cables, you
could lose your ability to control the airplane.''
   Plunkett agreed, speaking for the safety institute, a private
organization based in Worthington, Ohio, which has studied
airline-related issues since 1972.
   ``The biggest problem is the concussion pressure the bomb
causes,'' he said. ``If the plane was at 31,000 feet, it was
pressurized. If a bomb goes off and punctures the outside skin of
the plane, that would cause an explosive decompression of the cabin
and the entire aircraft.''
   ``When that happens, the entire cabin fills with a mist or a
cloud caused by the swift change in pressure,'' he said. ``It might
take a little longer to affect the cockpit, but the cockpit would be
affected.''
   ``Normally, an explosive decompression sends a plane into an
immediate, steep dive,'' he explained.
   ``Another possibility is that if there was a bomb, the plane went
out of control,'' he said. ``Depending on where a bomb is located,
the explosion might cut cables or wiring and you would lose the
ability to control the plane.''

   Pan American World Airways stepped up security
at key airports, and U.S. embassies issued travel warnings after a
threat two weeks ago that someone would ``unwittingly'' carry a bomb
aboard a Frankfurt to New York flight, officials said Thursday.
   While other causes have not been ruled out, the investigation
into Wednesday's crash of Pan Am Flight 103 is focusing on the
possibility of sabotage.
   The Boeing 747 jetliner crashed into a Scottish farming town,
killing all 258 aboard and at least 22 people on the ground. The
flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany and, after a plane
change in London, was en route to New York when it disappeared from
radar.
   Aviation experts cautioned Thursday that it was too early to
pinpoint a cause of the crash but said the widely scattered
wreckage, witness reports of a flash of light from the jet when at a
high altitude and its sudden disappearance from radar at 31,000 feet
all tend to support the sabotage theory.
   Government and airline industry officials acknowledged that they
received a threat in early December that Pan Am might be a target of
a terrorist attack. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an
``intelligence alert'' on Dec. 5 warning that there might be a
bombing attempt against a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt, West Germany.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said that on that day
an anonymous caller told the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki that ``an
unidentified person in Helsinki would unwittingly take the device to
Frankfurt and eventually onto the U.S.-bound flight.''
   Another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried
by a woman.
   Mrs. Oakley said the caller targeted Pan AM and told the embassy
that individuals who would provide the device have ties to Abu
Nidal, leader of a radical Palestinian faction.
   The Finnish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday that an
Arab resident had made several bomb threats during the year, most
recently on Dec. 5, but that ``in the investigation so far, no
direct connection has been found between the Arab living in Finland
and the air accident in question.''
   The statement said authorities knew the caller's identity and
that he had not left Finland since Dec. 5.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the State Department
warned embassies of the threat two days after it first was made and
also notified Pan Am and ``appropriate police'' in various parts of
the world.
   Flight 103 started in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727. Its passengers
and their luggage were transferred to a Boeing 747 and joined by
other passengers at London's Heathrow Airport for the flight to New
York. The crash occurred an hour after departure from London.
   Mrs. Oakley said British authorities also were notified of the
threat, but in London a spokesman for Heathrow Airport, Frances
Aldridge, told reporters, ``I can say categorically that we have not
heard of this.''
   Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman, said in New York: ``Pan Am
had received notification from various sources that there was the
possibility of a (terrorist) threat. ... We immediately acted and
put supplementary security procedures in effect, not only at
Frankfurt but at airports around the world.''
   She confirmed one of the warnings came from the Federal Aviation
Administration, but defended the airline's decision not to further
disclose the potential for danger, citing a portion of the memo that
directed the information to be ``solely for the use of U.S. carriers
and airport security personnel and may not be further disseminated
without the specific approval of the director of civil aviation
security.''
   The FAA in its alert said it was not in a position to evaluate
the reliability of the report, which named no specific terrorist
group, although it said the threat was ``Middle East oriented,''
according to sources, who spoke on the condition that they not be
identified.
   According to government sources, the alert was sent to airline
security officers, airport officials and specifically to Pan Am
because the airline was mentioned in the threat. The alert also went
to the State Department.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the agency had no comment on the
reported alert.
   A former FAA official familiar with such warnings said that while
such alerts are not infrequent, they are expected to be taken
seriously. ``It's more than a hint. It's a direct request to beef up
security,'' said the former official.
   As a result of the alert, airport officials at Frankfurt also
stepped up security earlier this month, according to Horst
Harnstein, an official at the airport.
   The State Department, meanwhile, warned its embassies of the
possible threat and at some embassies, including the one in Moscow,
an advisory was placed on employee bulletin boards.
   ``The FAA reports that the reliability of the information cannot
be assessed at this point, but the appropriate police authorities
have been notified and are pursuing the matter. Pan Am has also been
notified,'' William C. Kelly, the administrative counsel at the
embassy in Moscow, wrote in the advisory posted there.
   ``In view of the lack of confirmation of this information, (the
embassy) leaves to the discretion of individual travelers any
decisions on altering personal travel plans or changing to another
American carrier,'' the memo continued.
   State Department officials said at least four of those killed in
the Pan Am crash were government employees including two assigned to
the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.

   The Reagan administration said Thursday that it
was re-examining its policy against public disclosure of terrorist
threats against commercial airliners, such as the one that was made
against Pan Am two weeks ago but disclosed only to diplomatic
personnel.
   Pan Am flight 103, originating in Frankfurt, West Germany, with a
change of plane's at London's Heathrow Airport, crashed in Scotland
on Wednesday, killing all 258 people aboard and more than 20 on the
ground.
   U.S. embassies around the world and Pan Am officials were
informed about the threat against the airliner by an Arab resident
of Helsinki. But no word went out to the general public.
   ``I think that certainly will be looked at,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said as controversy swirled over the
government's policy not to inform the public of terrorist threats
involving U.S. carriers.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that ``the public should be aware'' of
such threats. ``Public notification has to be considered.''
   President-elect Bush said that if there was ``hard evidence''
that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not
be averted, the public should be warned.
   But he warned against giving ``undue attention to what the
terrorist wants to call attention to.''
   ``So often its best to handle these matters by aborting a
threat,'' Bush said.
   Until now, the policy has been for the State Department to pass
on information about terrorist threats to the carriers through the
Federal Aviation Administration and to the airports.
   ``It's then up to the airlines to take the precautions that they
deem are necessary for the security of their flights,'' State
Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pam Hanlon in New York said the airline
received a memo from the Federal Aviation Administration about the
threat and quoted the document as saying: ``The information in this
bulletin is solely for the use of U.S. carriers and airport security
personnel and may not be further disseminated without the specific
approval of the director of civil aviation security.''
   Private lawyers said Thursday that the fact that the U.S.
government and Pan Am were both aware of the bomb threat could raise
liability problems for the airline, but probably not for the
government.
   ``It's a difficult area, but if the government notifies the
airline in question, I think the government position is justified,''
said Lee Kreindler, a New York lawyer who specializes in aviation
accident cases.
   Asked what an airline's obligation is once it has been notified
of a specific threat, Kreindler said ``It's a tough situation. ...
They don't have to stop operating or stop flying, but certainly they
have a duty to meticulously inspect.''
   He said that in other instances of terrorism involving air
travel, lawsuits have focused on airline security precautions.
   The prior notification on U.S. embassy bulletin boards ``is going
to raise an interesting question for the other passengers who were
not members of the State Department staff: Whether they should have
received similar notice from Pan Am,'' said George N. Tompkins Jr.,
a lawyer specializing in defending airlines in accident cases.
   In Washington, officials were bombarded with questions about the
government's policy after powerful evidence emerged pointing to an
explosive device as the cause of the crash of Pan Am flight 103.
   Bush said individual threats had to be evaluated. ``I've found
with some experience in the intelligence business enormous numbers
of suggestions that there is going to be some terroristic action and
most of them never materialize,'' said Bush, a former director of
the CIA.
   Mrs. Oakley said that on Dec. 5, an unidentified individual
telephoned the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki and said that there would be
a bombing attempt within two weeks against a Pan Am aircraft flying
from Frankfurt to the United States.
   The conduit would be an ``unwitting'' passenger who would take
the device from Helsinki to Frankfurt and then board a U.S.-bound
flight, she said.
   Mrs. Oakley said dozens of threats are received each day and all
are taken seriously. L. Paul Bremer, who heads the State
Department's counter-terrorism office, said there have been 87 calls
similar to the Helsinki call over the past three months.
   But the Dec. 5 call, apparently from a tipster, appeared to be
taken more seriously than most others. Many U.S. embassies were
apprised of the threat, including the American mission in Moscow,
where a notice of the threat was posted on a bulletin board.
   Ronald Spiers, the State Department under secretary for
management, suggested that chaos would result if the government
reacted to each terrorist threat.
   ``One of the kind of problems you face is overkill,'' Spiers
said. ``You get a lot of these threats; people tend to get bored
with it.''
   ``We try to be responsible. We try to make sure that everybody
who is possibly involved receives this information. But we're not
the airlines ourselves,'' he said.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Dan Howard said no posting of the
warning was made at the various U.S. military commands around the
world.
   ``The only explanation that I have been able to get is that there
are many of these notices sent out in the course of the year and
they are not generally posted,'' Howard said.
   He said at least six U.S. military personnel were aboard the Pan
Am flight.

   Corpses were strewn on a golf course
and children played beside twisted airplane wreckage Thursday in
this village scarred physically and emotionally by the Pan Am crash.
   Residents recalled whooshing noises and tremendous flames as the
stricken Boeing 747 jumbo jet roared low overhead, spewing pieces
over the rolling countryside and finally crashing in fragments
across their streets and houses Wednesday evening.
   All 258 people aboard Pan Am Flight 103 from Frankfurt to New
York, via London, died and as many as 22 people were killed on the
ground, some in cars hit by wreckage, officials said. The number of
people on the plane was lowered when it was found that an airline
employee was counted twice.
   ``It is beyond one's comprehension,'' murmured Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, who toured the village. ``It is beyond one's
imagination. ... You have to come here to see it and to realize.''
   A long, deep crater tore a black scar along a row of houses.
Other homes, drenched in flaming aviation fuel, were gutted.
   Survivors comforted each other, felt lucky to be alive, and tried
to clean up some of the mess in the town of 2,500 people.
   In a yard next to the main street lay the cover of one engine,
but the fence and adjacent building were undamaged. Children
bicycled around a chunk of fuselage, and the grocer boarded up his
shattered store front.
   Scorched pillows, lifejackets and fragments of clothing lay
scattered in gardens. Chunks of metal, some as small as coins and
others two feet in diameter, had sliced through roofs and shattered
windows in homes and cars.
   Charred dollar bills, a mud-spattered seatbelt and tattered
copies of the Pan Am inflight magazine added to the melancholy scene.
   Lockerbie's town hall became a makeshift morgue as firefighters
recovered remains strewn about town. Eight bodies lay on a
neighboring golf course, covered in tarpaulins and guarded by police.
   Four miles outside town, the nose cone of the blue-and-white
jumbo jet was tipped on its side in a muddy field.
   ``There'll be no Christmas this year as far as Lockerbie is
concerned,'' said Bobby Scott, a builder who had just finished work
Wednesday night when he heard the explosion.
   He dashed out to see the jet heading toward the gas station, and
watched the disaster unfold yards from him.
   The plane was breaking up as he saw it come over a hill about 200
yards from the main street that runs through the town of mainly
two-story stone shops and houses.
   ``There were flames everywhere and pieces dropping off the plane
and it just kept going,'' said Scott, 30, who escaped unscathed.
   ``I was very, very lucky. Many of us here were,'' he said. ``I
think all of us just think so much of all those Americans who were
on that plane.''
   Nora Pickersgill, 60, was out playing bingo when her house was
damaged by wreckage.
   ``Normally, I would have been in,'' she said as she swept up
shattered glass. ``I still can't believe what happened. It just
isn't the sort of thing that happens to you, just not the sort of
thing that happens in a quiet place like this.''
   In Sherwood Park, the worst-hit street, two houses were
demolished and their occupants feared dead. Pieces of fuselage were
embedded in gardens.
   Ronald Miller, 74, was watching television and his wife, Jane,
was in the kitchen getting a glass of water when the home they had
bought six months ago was turned into a ball of flame and partially
demolished.
   ``I heard a huge whoosh,'' said Miller. ``I thought it was a
low-flying military plane. I ducked down, then the window fell in
and I was shot head first into the television set.''
   The Millers rushed outside and were saved. Now Miller, a retired
plasterer, clutched a plastic bag containing a shaving set he had
just bought, and sat with his wife in a cafe on the main street.
   Miller's head was badly cut, but otherwise they were uninjured.
   Outside, police put up barriers for the arrivals of Prince
Andrew, the Duke of York, and Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``We've lost everything,'' Miller said, ``things we can never
replace, our home and a lifetime's possessions.''

   Investigators on Thursday began to reconstruct the
final hours of Pan Am Flight 103, giving special attention to
threats of a terrorist attack.
   The chief of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch opened an
investigation of the London stopover of the Boeing 747 that crashed
Wednesday night in southern Scotland, killing all 258 on board and
22 on the ground. The number of those on the plane was lowered when
Pan Am discovered it had counted a flight attendant twice.
   The flight originated with a Boeing 727 in Frankfurt, West
Germany, and continued as a Boeing 747 from London, en route to New
York.
   The U.S. State Department said an anonymous caller said Dec. 5
that a bomb would be planted on the flight from Frankfurt, West
Germany to London. U.S. officials said warnings were issued to its
embassies.
   According to British authorities, word never reached Heathrow
Airport.
   ``I can say categorically that we had not heard of this. ... We
were definitely unaware of any threat,'' said airport spokesman
Frances Aldridge.
   On Thursday, an anonymous caller to The Associated Press in
London claimed an explosive had been planted aboard Flight 103 in
revenge for the downing of an Iranian airliner by the U.S. Navy in
July.
   The sabotage theory focused on the transfer of luggage between
the Boeing 727 that flew the Frankfurt-London leg, and the Boeing
747 that took off for New York.
   Experts said such switchovers could pose security risks, because
a passenger could leave the flight in London while sending deadly
cargo on to New York.
   Pan Am's baggage-checking system is intended to ensure that every
person who checks baggage boards the aircraft, airline spokesman
Harold Kosel said in Frankfurt.
   Asked whether a passenger might have disembarked in London while
sending luggage on to New York, Kosel said, ``I think it's out of
the question.''
   Hans Neusel, state secretary at West Germany's Interior Ministry,
said Thursday night the West German Federal Criminal Office ``was in
continuous, close contact with Scotland Yard for the immediate relay
of information to us.''
   Neusel told West German TV ``we don't believe there are any soft
spots in security'' at Frankfurt airport.
   But David Learmont, an editor of the industry magazine Flight
International, said in London that ``I think they can be very
confident, but I don't think anyone can be totally sure.''
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, reported that
54 million pieces of luggage move through Heathrow in a year.
   Pan Am operates two daily non-stops to the United States from
Frankfurt, as well as Flight 103.
   In Washington, the State Department's counterterrorism office
offered FBI forensics and disaster units to assist British
authorities. ``I would think we would probably use our own,'' said a
Department of Transport spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Government and industry officials said it seemed clear that the
Boeing 747 had broken apart in flight, strewing blazing wreckage
over the Scottish village of Lockerbie and surrounding hills, and
that the most likely causes were an explosive device or structural
failure.
   Such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with flight
controller reports that the cockpit sent no distress call as the
plane, having reached cruising altitude of 31,000 feet, disappeared
from radar.
   ``Speculation is not evidence,'' said Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, during a visit to the crash scene. ``We are systematically
searching the evidence and the hills around.''
   The devices that record flight data and cockpit conversations
were recovered, and a multinational investigation was taking shape.
   Donald Cooper, chief inspector of the air accident investigation
branch of Britain's Department of Transport, had overall charge of
the probe.
   Under international agreement, a Department of Transport
spokesman said, the United States was entitled to participate,
through the National Transportation Safety Board. Experts also also
expected from the Boeing Co. and from Pratt and Whitney, which
manufactured the engines.
   George Churchill-Coleman, commander of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, opened an investigation that was expected to
focus on the 65 minutes between Flight 103's arrival at Heathrow on
Wednesday night and its departure for New York.

   A bus loaded with Christmas travelers careened
off a highway in the Andes on Thursday and tumbled down a 100-foot
ravine, killing at least 21 people and injuring at least 12, police
said.
   In the same area, Maoist guerrillas from the Shining Path
movement blew up part of a railroad bridge close to the 15,700-foot
summit of the highest standard-gauge railroad in the world,
according to police.
   They said the two incidents were not connected, though they took
place hours apart and both occurred outside Casapalca, a town 60
miles east of Lima lying in a key transportation corridor linking
the coast with the highlands.
   Police said the bus death toll could grow.
   They said a preliminary investigation indicated recent heavy
rains caused a rockslide at a curve in the highway.
   Surviving pssengers and police said heavy fog obscured visibility
and contributed to the pre-dawn crash.
   The privately owned bus was bound from Cerro de Pasco to Lima, a
distance of 120 miles, and carried about 45 passengers, police said.
   Shining Path guerrillas exploded dynamite around midnight
Wednesday that heavily damaged girders of the rail bridge, police
said. No trains were in the area and no one was hurt. Officials said
rail traffic would be suspended for days for repairs.
   The Shining Path, Peru's biggest and most violent guerrilla
group, has attacked and disabled rail links dozens of times in its
eight-year insurgency.
   In Lima, attackers believed to be pro-Cuban guerrillas fired a
mortar shell that failed to explode at offices of the state mineral
marketing firm Minpeco. Police said they recovered the mortar from a
nearby park.
   Guerillas also bombed two suburban department stores, breaking
windows, officials said.
   No one was hurt in the attacks.
   Police said the Tupa Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a small rebel
band that endorses a Cuban-styled Marxism, probably carried out the
Lima attacks.

   In addition to the second-degree murder charges, jurors were
instructed that they could consider convicting Jonathan Swapp and
Singer on lesser charges including manslaughter and negligent
homicide.
   The jury had begun deliberating Monday night following nine days
of testimony from 51 prosecution and seven defense witnessses,
including Addam Swapp and Jonathan Swapp.
   Prosecutor Creighton Horton told jurors that the defendants
deliberately embraced a course of confrontation that led to House's
death. Defense attorneys countered that clan members, while
well-armed, never intended to hurt anyone and feared police were
looking for an excuse to kill them.
   House was killed and Addam Swapp seriously wounded in a firefight
that ended the standoff at the clan's Marion farm. The compound was
surrounded by an army of 100 FBI-led police Jan. 16, hours after
Addam Swapp, claiming divine inspiration, bombed a Mormon chapel.
   Prosecutors had maintained that Addam Swapp ``basically declared
war on the church, state and nation'' when he bombed the chapel.
   The trial concluded the second of two prosecutions against clan
members. In May, the three and Vickie Singer, the mother of John
Timothy and Addam Swapp's two wives, were convicted of federal
violations in the standoff, which followed the bombing of the chapel.
   In those crimes, Addam Swapp was sentenced to 15 years, John
Timothy Singer and Jonathan Swapp to 10 years and Vickie Singer to
five years.
   Addam Swapp testified in the latest trial that his family's
battle with society had really begun in 1979 when polygamist
patriarch John Singer was gunned down by police during at arrest
attempt at the same farm where clan members barricaded themselves
last January.
   Police said Singer, who had clashed with authorities over his
refusal to send his children to public schools or teach a
state-approved curriculum at home, was shot to death when he pulled
a gun on officers sent to arrest him. Singer's family maintained he
was shot in the back, but a federal judge dismissed a $110 million
wrongful-death suit filed by Mrs. Singer.
   The maximum penalty for second-degree murder is five years to
life in prison. For manslaughter, the maximum term is zero to five
years, and for negligent homicide one year in jail and a $2,500 fine.

great spirits.''
   No other details would be provided, Freeman said.
   Miss Barrymore already was an actress with television commercial
and movie experience at age 6 when she played the impetuous Gertie
in ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.''
   The daughter of Hungarian-born actress Ildiko Jaid, third wife of
reclusive John Barrymore Jr., Miss Barrymore is the granddaughter of
John Barrymore, who starred in such film classics as ``Grand Hotel''

   Matthew Trento still held his ticket for Pan Am Flight 103 when
he arrived home, safe and sound, one of the lucky ones.
   Trento, a senior at Syracuse University in New York, lost three
roommates on Flight 103, which crashed Wednesday in Scotland on its
way to New York from London. His mother had booked him on another
flight, five hours earlier.
   ``I was sitting there looking at my ticket after the flight went
down,'' Trento, 22, said. ``It really just made me wonder.''
   Syracuse University officials said 35 students in their Division
of International Programs Abroad in London were booked on the Boeing
747. All 258 people on board were killed, and authorities said
sabotage may be the cause.
   The holiday miracle of a missed flight came to a few, too few,
others.
   ``I believe in guardian angels. ... I'm so thrilled that he's all
right, ... it's going to be such a great Christmas,'' said Jackie
Richardson of Ironton, Ohio, whose son, Robert, a Navy machinist's
mate, took an alternate flight.
   Other military families were not as lucky. The Army said there
were at least eight soldiers and five of their dependents aboard
Flight 103, while the Air Force said three of its personnel and five
of their dependents were on the plane. One of those killed, Army
Sgt. Lloyd David Ludlow, 41, was traveling to Hutchinson, Kan., for
the funeral of his sister.
   ``It's hard for me to understand. The boy never did a thing wrng
in his life. The sunlight has been taken out of a lot of people's
lives,'' said George Williams of suburban Baltimore, whose son,
First Lt. George W. ``Jordy'' Williams, 24, was aboard Flight 103.
Williams, who was stationed near Frankfurt, West Germany, missed his
intended flight because of a traffic jam and made a connection with
the Pan Am flight.
   Also affected was the Justice Department, where flags were
ordered flown at half-staff in memory of Michael Bernstein, an
attorney for the Office of Special Investigations, the department's
Nazi-hunting unit. Bernstein, 36, married and the father of two, had
been in Austria negotiating a treaty that would allow some former
Nazis in the United States to be deported to that country, the
Justice Department said.
   ``It's not just a headline in the paper. This makes us long all
the more for the Christmas message to come through, peace on earth.
We obviously don't have it yet,'' Roman Catholic Bishop Anthony
Bosco of Greensburg, Pa., said Thursday after learning that two
Seton Hill College students _ Beth Ann Johnson, 21, of Greensburg
and Elyse Saraceni, 20, of Crabtree _ were on the jet.
   Janet MacQuarrie, the wife of the pilot of the jetliner, said
Thursday she planned no funeral for her 55-year-old husband, James,
but asked Americans to observe a moment of silence at 1 p.m. on
Christmas Day for the crash victims.
   Skip Vaught, also a pilot, and John Fenton, longtime friends of
the MacQuarrie family of Kensington, N.H., spoke with reporters at
Town Hall.
   Asked if they had discussed the dangers of terrorism, Vaught
said, ``Naturally, all pilots talk about this sort of thing, but we
do our jobs.''
   Fenton read the request by Mrs. MacQuarrie that donations be sent
to the New England Home for Little Wanderers in Boston, where her
husband spent time as an orphaned youngster.
   First Officer Raymond R. Wagner, 52, of Pennington, N.J., was
remembered by his church's former pastor, the Rev. Walter Coats, as
``a person who accepted his job as a pilot in a very serious manner.
... If I could have ever chosen which pilot would fly my plane, I
would have chosen Raymond Wagner.''
   At Detroit Metropolitan Airport, the final destination of Flight
103, families of Michigan-bound passengers, including two executives
of Troy-based Volkswagen United States Inc., learned the grim news.
Families of some of the 156 victims of a Northwest Airlines crash at
the airport two years ago consoled the grieving.
   At Syracuse University on Wednesday night, 500 people gathered at
a chapel, where chaplains of five faiths led a prayer service.
   ``We gathered because we needed to come together. The students
needed to demonstrate their sorrow, to be with one another,'' said
the Rev. Paul Kowalewski, a Protestant chaplain. ``It's Christmas,
they're students and young _ everything in a tragedy is built into
this.''
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo issued a statement Thursday expressing
his sorrow and ordering flags flown at half-staff through Saturday.
   ``For all the lives lost and particularly to the Syracuse
University community, we extend our most profound and heartfelt
sympathies and our prayers for strength,'' Cuomo said.
   Elsewhere on campus, more than 25,000 people at a basketball game
Wednesday night paused for a minute of silence and a brief prayer.
   ``This is the saddest day of my life,'' said University
Chancellor Melvin Eggers. ``We've lost some of the brightest,
talented, most beautiful people. It's hard to express our sorrow.''
   In North Adams, Mass., news that Wendy Lincoln, 23, would not be
coming home stunned many in the community of 16,500, said Mayor John
Barrett 3d. ``The Christmas presents are under the tree and of
course she won't be home,'' he said.
   Ms. Lincoln, a Syracuse University student, was on Flight 103,
according to the school.
   Her family had planned to meet her at John F. Kennedy Airport in
New York with a rented limousine as a special holiday touch. ``(Mrs.
Lincoln) had taken the day off and was all excited to pick up her
daughter,'' Barrett said.
   Another victim, Jim Pitt, 24, of South Hadley, Mass., had planned
to fly home directly from Germany, where he was studying, but at the
last minute decided to fly with a friend to London first, his family
said.
   Pitt called home and left a message that he would be on the Pan
Am flight, his mother, Sallie Hughes Pitt, said.
   She said Pitt was a champion fencer and a poet who wrote long
letters home regularly.
   ``He would call me up and say, `How're you doing, Mom? I was
thinking about you today.' He did that just last week and said he
was looking forward to coming home,'' she said.

<HEAD>Libya Denies U.S. Charges It Built Chemical Weapons Plant</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Reagan-Libya</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Libya on Thursday denied U.S. charges that it built a
chemical weapons plant and declared its ``full commitment to all
international conventions'' regarding such weapons, the official
news agency JANA reported.
   The statement from the People's Bureau for Foreign Liaison,
Libya's foreign ministry, was issued after President Reagan said the
United States and its allies were discussing military action against
the plant.
   The radical North African Arab nation has said repeatedly that
the factory produces pharmaceuticals. JANA said earlier Thursday
that Libyan doctors, nurses and pharmacists are planning a sit-in at
the plant in a move apparently intended to discourage any attack.
   Libya has ``repeatedly denied all misleading U.S. claims,'' said
the People's Bureau statement, according to the agency, monitored in
Rome and London.
   It said the Reagan administration's aim was to blunt the
development of Arab societies and ``to this end it will market all
the excuses it can find to mislead and trick world public opinion.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday the United
States believes the plant ``can produce enormous quantities of
chemical weapons.''
   The Washington Post quoted intelligence sources as saying the
plant is 35 miles southwest of Tripoli and includes facilities for
producing bombs and canisters to carry poisonous gas.
   The subject of chemical weapons will be taken up next month at a
convention of more than 100 countries in Paris called to discuss
enforcement of the 1925 Geneva Convention outlawing chemical arms.
   Libya on Thursday accused the United States of trying to ruin the
Paris convention and divert attention from its own chemical weapons
stocks.
   ``While categorically denying all the American allegations, Libya
reaffirms its full commitment to all international conventions and
treaties concerning chemical weapons,'' the statement said.
   JANA's earlier dispatch, which quoted unidentified ``senior
medical sources,'' did not say when the sit-in at the plant would
begin.
   ``Those sources also said that this noble civilized
accomplishment (the plant) will never be destroyed except over the
dead bodies of us _ the doctors, pharmacists and nurses,'' it said.
   The United States bombed Libya in 1986 in strikes that killed at
least 100 people in retaliation for a terrorist attack on a West
Berlin disco that killed two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman and
wounded 229 people.

   The FBI will help Scotland Yard investigate
the cause of a Pan Am jet crash in Scotland that killed all 258
people aboard, FBI Director William Sessions said Thursday.
   Sessions said he had reports of ``a number of calls'' taking
responsibility for the disaster that killed everyone on the plane,
along with 22 residents of the Scottish village of Lockerbie, where
it crashed Wednesday.
   Some callers claimed association with terrorist organizations,
Sessions said at a news conference. He declined to say if Pan
American Flight 103 _ en route from Frankfurt, Germany, to New York
_ was the target of terrorism.
   But David Kyd, spokesman for the International Air Transport
Association in Geneva, said structural failure of the plane was
unlikely.
   ``Sabotage is the most likely explanation,'' Kyd said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the State Department
warned U.S. embassies earlier this month about a bomb threat made
against Pan Am jetliners flying from Frankfurt to the United States.
   Bomb experts with the FBI will visit the crash site and assist
with a technical investigation at Scotland Yard as well, Sessions
said. Britain's top anti-terrorism official, Commander George
Churchill-Coleman, also joined the investigation Thursday.
   Fitzwater said he couldn't explain why more people were not
notified of the threat, and Sessions said actions following the
threat will be evaluated.
   The authority for the FBI action, Sessions said, comes from
federal law allowing investigation abroad in cases of destruction of
U.S. aircraft or when Americans might be victims of terrorism.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament, with a big agenda and a
newfound propensity for debate, decided on Thursday to postpone
debate until next month on landmark new laws recognizing formation
of political groups independent of the Communist Party.
   The laws are part of the communist government's ``package plan
for democracy,'' which calls for adoption of a new constitution and
a separate law on new political parties before parliamentary
elections in 1990.
   The new laws were the ninth item on a 15-point agenda adopted
when this parliamentary session opened Tuesday. It was the third
meeting in three months of what was once a rubber stamp legislature
in session just 12 days a year.
   Speaker Istvan Stadinger said earlier that the 383-member
Parliament would take an unprecedented Christmas recess and
reconvene on Jan. 10 to conclude business if the agenda was not
completed by Friday.
   Debate this week centered on economic issues, including the 1989
budget and modification of the East bloc's first personal income
tax, introduced Jan. 1.
   Struggling with a $17 billion foreign debt and a stagnating
economy, Hungary has embarked on comprehensive economic reforms. It
introduced market forces, invited foreign investment, cut subsidies
to money-losing firms and taxed personal incomes.
   Following a recent trend for deputies to engage in genuine
debate, more than 40 deputies asked to speak on the budget this week.
   Pressure from deputies caused a vote to be postponed on a
proposed modification of the personal income tax law until another
compromise could be worked out.
   The laws on association and assembly have been long awaited and
much debated in Hungary, where over the past year dozens of
independent groups have developed. Many have highly political
platforms and want to put up candidates in 1990 elections.
   According to drafts published this week, the laws will recognize
the basic right of citizens to assemble and associate, and determine
registration procedures and regulations for independent groups. The
ruling party is the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

<HEAD>Cold Front Moves Through Rockies; Storm Racks West Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold front moving through Colorado Thursday brought winds
gusting to more than 140 mph along the Rockies' front range and
triggered heavy thunderstorms in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and
Missouri.
   Meanwhile, another western storm moved into the Pacific Coast
states, bringing heavy rain and high surfs to the California
coastline and snow in the mountains.
   Mount Evans, west of Denver, reported the strongest wind gust
Thursday _ 141 mph, said weather service forecaster Dan Leszcynski.
He said instruments on atop the mountain recorded zero as the high
temperature.
   ``You're probably looking at minus 160 or so wind-chill,'' he
said.
   Other wind gusts behind the cold front were 123 mph near Fort
Collins and 78 mph near Wellington, Colo. An avalanche warning was
in effect for the entire Colorado mountain region because of the
winds and fresh snowfall.
   The same cold front brought thunderstorms from east-central Texas
across eastern Oklahoma into southwest Missouri.
   Freezing rain slickened roads in eastern Iowa and northwest
Illinois. Light snow fell from north-central Nebraska across central
and northeastern South Dakota, with 1 to 4 inches' accumulation
expected.
   Farther west, a separate storm system brought heavy rain and
ocean swells of 15 to 25 feet along the northern and central
California coast. Snow continued to fall in the mountains of
California, where Happy Camp got up to 24 inches in 24 hours and
Trinity River Conservation Camp got 18 inches in the same period.
The heavy snowfall closed numerous mountain roads, including
Interstate 5 near the California-Oregon border.
   Heavy rain over the already-saturated San Francisco Bay area
produced local street flooding and mudslides. Many northern
California towns had more than an inch of rain in a 12-hour period
ending at 1 p.m. EST, including Ross, with 2.52 inches; Gasquet, 2
inches; Shasta Dam, 1.85 inches; San Rafael, 1.40 inches; Soquel
Creek, 1.38 inches; and Berkeley, 1.11 inches.
   Winter storm warnings were issued for the Mount Shasta, Siskiyou
region, the Northeast Plateau and the Sierra Nevada mountains in
California, as well as Nevada's western mountains and higher
elevations of southwest Oregon.
   Elsewhere, Joplin and Columbia, Mo., got 1.64 inches and 1.14
inches of rain, respectively, in the six-hour period ending at 1
p.m. EST. Snowfall during the same six-hour period included 4 inches
at Burns, Ore., and 1 inch at International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Loring Air Force Base near Limestone, Maine, to 84
degrees at McAllen, Texas. The morning low for the nation was 2
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo.
   Friday's forecast called for more showers and thunderstorms from
the central Gulf Coast across the central and southern Appalachians,
the eastern Ohio Valley, the upper Great Lakes and the central and
middle Atlantic Coast states to southern New England, with freezing
rain over northeast New York and parts of Vermont. Snow was
predicted over the northern Rockies and western parts of the central
Rockies. Rain also was forecast along the central and northern
Pacific coasts.
   High temperatures should be in the teens and 20s from central
Montana and western Wyoming across the northern Plains and the upper
Mississippi Valley to western upper Michigan, and over much of
Maine. Highs in the 30s and 40s should extend from the northern and
central Pacific Coast, the northern half of the southern Plateau,
much of the central and southern Rockies, the central Plains, Iowa
and northern Missouri, the Great Lakes and the central and northern
Appalachians to the Middle Atlantic Coast and much of New England.
Readings in the 70s should stretch over south-central and southeast
Texas, the Gulf Coast, northern Florida and southern Georgia, and
warming into the 80s in southern Florida. Highs in the 50s and 60s
should be the rule elsewhere.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
congratulated Cuban President Fidel Castro on the accord signed at
U.N. headquarters Thursday granting independence to South-West
Africa, the official Cuban news agency said.
   Gorbachev called the accord an important step foward toward peace
and security and praised the Cubans' ``heroic help'' in the fight
for independence, according to a Prensa Latina dispatch monitored in
Mexico City.
   Cuban troops went to Angola in 1975 to help its Marxist
government fight guerrillas and invading South African troopers.
   The accord signed by South Africa, Cuba and Angola establishes
the independence of Africa's last colony, South-West Africa, also
called Namibia, to begin April 1. It calls for the phased withdrawal
of the 50,000 Cuban troops now in Angola.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since capturing it from Germany in
World War I.
   The Angolan state news agency ANGOP meanwhile reported on
Thursday that troops killed 53 guerrillas in clashes across Angola
in the last week.
   The report, monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, said troops freed 126
civilians and seized military hardware in clashes in six provinces
Dec. 14-21.
   ANGOP said government forces suffered nine fighters killed and 21
injured and said rebels from UNITA _ the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ killed 15 civilians and wounded 23 in
attacks on villages.
   No independent confirmation of the report was available.
   UNITA, backed by the United States and South Africa, is not party
to the accord and has vowed to persist in its 13-year war against
the Marxist government.

   A leading Serbian politician assailed
plans to establish independent political parties in Yugoslavia's
liberal northern republic of Slovenia, newspapers reported Thursday.
   ``Those who demand that the Communist Party divest itself of
power ... are trying to turn the party into a debating club and to
push the party off the political scene,'' said Vjislav Micovic,
according to a report in Politika daily.
   Micovic, a leader of the Serbian Socialist Alliance and close
associate of Serbian party chief Slobodan Milosevic, was quoted as
saying purported party reformers are ``offering us stale old forms
of multiparty political organization.''
   Two Slovenian groups have announced plans to set up independent
parties in Yugoslavia's most westward-looking republic, where
authorities have adopted an unprecedented degree of tolerance.
   The Social Democratic Party is to hold its founding conference
Dec. 27 and the Slovenian Democratic Union is to be established Jan.
10.
   Although top Communist Party and government officials in Slovenia
have said the formation of the new parties would be ``damaging,'' no
other measures seem to have been taken to prevent the gatherings.
   The Slovenian and Serbian leaderships have been at odds since
Milosevic's hard-line faction came to power last year and are
sharply divided over ways to overcome Yugoslavia's economic and
social crisis.

   The State Department's chief counter-terrorism
official said Thursday night that not enough is known to conclude
that sabotage caused Wednesday's crash of a Pan Am jumbo jet with
258 people aboard.
   ``We don't know if this is a terrorist attack,'' L. Paul Bremer,
U.S. ambassador at large for counter-terrorism, said in an
Associated Press interview regarding the crash in Scotland that also
killed 22 people on the ground.
   Bremer said at least three groups claimed responsibility for the
crash after it occurred, but he said, ``That's not unusual. There
are often claims after an event like this.''
   A caller identifying himself with the Guardians of Islamic
Revolution, a group that supports Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, telephoned the AP in London.
   Another caller who said he was with the Islamic Jihad, a Moslem
fundamentalist group, called a television network in New York, while
a third claim was made by the Ulster Defense group, Bremer said.
   So far, he said, none has proved to be connected to the crash.
   He noted that the Federal Aviation Administration ``has pretty
good reporting about very heavy winds at this altitude, up to 200
knots in the jet stream. So it's premature to assess this as
sabotage.''
   Still, Bremer said, ``You certainly want to rule this out. Until
we look at the `black box' and forensic evidence, we should hold our
cool.''
   So far, Bremer said, ``there is very little you can determine.''
   Meanwhile, Bremer said, an investigation is continuing on a call
to the U.S. embassy in Helsinki two weeks ago claiming the radical
Palestinian Abu Nidal group planned to sabotage a Pan American
jetliner on the way from Frankfurt, West Germany, to New York.
   As a result, Bremer said, U.S. embassies in Europe and FAA
officials were advised to alert airlines and security personnel to
upgrade security in both Frankfurt and London.
   A total of 105 such advisories were issued in the last three
months, an average of about one a day, Bremer said. Many of them
followed tips that seemed more serious than the Helsinki call, he
said.
   In ``many, many cases'' of sabotage, the U.S. official said, ``we
find out who did it. But it takes time.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Won't Judge Bush Yet, But He Applauds Some Moves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although he says it's too early to judge
President-elect George Bush, Michael Dukakis tentatively gave the
man who trounced him in the Nov. 8 election credit Thursday for
showing signs of moderation on Central America.
   ``If that's the way the new administration begins, then I think
that's hopeful,'' the governor said in an interview with The
Associated Press, his first since immediately after the presidential
election. ``Once you get elected, you can't talk about reading your
lips. You've got to get serious.''
   Seated in his Statehouse office, Dukakis _ who held one press
conference immediately after his loss to assess the campaign _
refused to review the campaign in detail, saying he preferred to
focus on the future.
   But the Democrat also declined to tip his hand about his plans
when his current term as governor runs out in 1990.
   ``It's much too early. At this point, I'm decompressing, working
hard on what's happening here, enjoying a certain amount of normalcy
in my life,'' Dukakis said.
   After a week's vacation in Florida, Dukakis appeared relaxed and
reflective, more interested in his state's budget problems than in
the national agenda he touted before losing to Bush 54 percent to 46
percent.
   ``There's not much sense in re-running the campaign. I mean, we
did some things well, we did other things not so well,'' he said.
``It wasn't successful. Obviously, I'm disappointed. Lots of people
are disappointed. We worked very hard. But I don't think it's
something to dwell on.''
   Dukakis, who had never waged a national campaign before, said his
biggest surprise was the change that overtook him immediately after
the Democratic National Convention in July.
   ``You're spending half your life on the plane,'' he said. ``The
rest of the time it's a combination of the press and the Secret
Service that makes it very difficult for a guy like me, who loves
public life because of the contact you have with people and the
chance to talk. You can't do anymore. Everything you do is a kind of
massive public event.''
   Asked to evaluate Bush's initial appointments and policy
statements, Dukakis said it was too early to draw conclusions.
   However, the governor, who has attacked President Reagan's
Central America policies, said he was pleased by reports that Bush
has decided not to ask Congress immediately for renewed support for
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and that Bush hopes to forge a
bipartisan consensus and involve Latin leaders.
   ``I think it's the right policy,'' Dukakis said. ``When I met
with him I strongly urged him to do that. I said I think the present
policy is a failure.''
   Dukakis said he would give Bush ``a good six months to a year''
before he would criticize the new president.
   ``Obviously, he's got massive budget and deficit problems. Every
day there's another story saying it's worse,'' he said, citing
saving and loans troubles, farmers' home mortgages and other
budgetary woes.
   ``These are all things that had been deferred. ... He's got to
deal with them,'' Dukakis said.

<TEXT>
   Three members of a polygamist clan were
convicted Thursday on reduced charges ranging from manslaughter to
negligent homicide in the shootout death of a law officer that ended
a 13-day siege of the clan's compound.
   The jury found clan patriarch Addam Swapp, 27, guilty of
manslaughter and his brother, Jonathan Swapp, 21, guilty of
negligent homicide. Their brother-in-law, John Timothy Singer, 22, _
who actually fired the shot from his wheelchair _ was convicted of
manslaughter.
   All three were charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 28
slaying of Utah Corrections Lt. Fred House, who was gunned down
during a botched arrest attempt as he was directing attack dogs
toward the Swapp brothers. The ensuing firefight ended a 13-day
police siege of the clan's rural, northern Utah farm.
   Jurors deliberated 25{ hours before returning the verdicts in 3rd
District court. The jury got a late start Thursday when Judge
Michael Murphy amended his instructions to allow jurors to consider
lesser charges against Addam Swapp.
   In addition to the second-degree murder charges, jurors were
instructed that they could consider convicting Jonathan Swapp and
Singer on lesser charges including manslaughter and negligent
homicide.
   The jury had begun deliberating Monday night following nine days
of testimony from 51 prosecution and seven defense witnessses,
including Addam Swapp and Jonathan Swapp.
   Ann House, the slain officer's widow, issued a statement saying
she attended the trial to better understand her husband's death.
   ``I know there is sympathy for people who are young, socially
isolated and therefore limited in experience and maturity,'' she
said. ``But when there is planned and continued violence that
results in the death of a police officer, these people can't be let
off easily.''
   Clan members were generally upbeat about the verdicts.
   ``The judge did a fair job,'' said Charlotte Singer Swapp, who
along with her sister, Heidi, is wife to Addam Swapp. ``I'm glad I
got a chance to hug him (Addam Swapp) and that he got to hug the
children,'' she said, referring to Murphy's allowing the clan
patriarch to hold his young sons before being led away.
   Charlotte Swapp said she and Anne Swapp, Jonathan's new bride,
hoped the Swapp brothers would be incarcerated at the same federal
prison so the two wives could share a home nearby.
   Heidi Swapp said that while the trial was fair ``in man's eyes,''
she still prayed for a miracle.
   Prosecutor Creighton Horton told jurors that the defendants
deliberately embraced a course of confrontation that led to House's
death. Defense attorneys countered that clan members, while
well-armed, never intended to hurt anyone and feared police were
looking for an excuse to kill them.
   House was killed and Addam Swapp seriously wounded in the
firefight that ended the standoff at the clan's Marion farm. The
compound was surrounded by an army of 100 FBI-led police Jan. 16,
hours after Addam Swapp, claiming divine inspiration, bombed a
Mormon chapel.
   Prosecutors had maintained that Addam Swapp ``basically declared
war on the church, state and nation'' when he bombed the chapel.
   The trial concluded the second of two prosecutions against clan
members. In May, the three and Vickie Singer, the mother of John
Timothy and Addam Swapp's two wives, were convicted of federal
violations in the standoff.
   In those crimes, Addam Swapp was sentenced to 15 years, John
Timothy Singer and Jonathan Swapp to 10 years and Vickie Singer to
five years.
   Addam Swapp testified in the latest trial that his family's
battle with society had really begun in 1979 when polygamist
patriarch John Singer was gunned down by police during at arrest
attempt at the same farm where clan members barricaded themselves
last January.
   Police said Singer, who had clashed with authorities over his
refusal to send his children to public schools or teach a
state-approved curriculum at home, was shot to death when he pulled
a gun on officers sent to arrest him. Singer's family maintained he
was shot in the back, but a federal judge dismissed a $110 million
wrongful-death suit filed by Mrs. Singer.
   The maximum penalty for second-degree murder is five years to
life in prison. For manslaughter, the maximum term is zero to five
years, and for negligent homicide one year in jail and a $2,500 fine.
   Judge Murphy scheduled sentencing for Jan. 20 and ordered the
trio returned to Salt Lake County Jail in Salt Lake City, 40 miles
to the west, until then.

<TEXT>
   NBC will add three new shows to its prime-time
schedule and bring back the comedy series ``My Two Dads'' in January
and February, Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment,
said Thursday.
   The new shows are ``Father Dowling Mysteries,'' starring Tom
Bosley as a probing parish priest, ``Unsub,'' starring David Soul,
Kent McCord and M. Emmett Walsh as members of a crack Justice
Department crime team, and ``Nightingales,'' starring Suzanne
Pleshette and Barry Newman in a series about student nurses.
   Two series, ``Sonny Spoon'' and ``Something Is Out There,'' have
been canceled, while two others, ``Baby Boom'' and ``Tattinger's,''
are being taken off the air for creative changes.
   Bosley stars as a Chicago priest who can't help solving crimes
that baffle the police. He will be assisted by Tracy Nelson, who
stars as Sister Steve. The series will air at 8 p.m. EST on Friday,
Jan. 20, with a special two-hour episode. Thereafter, it will be
shown at 8 p.m. on Fridays. It's from Fred Silverman Productions,
which also makes ``Matlock,'' ``Jake and the Fatman'' and ``In the
Heat of the Night.''
   ``Unsub'' is the title of the one-hour police drama that will
premiere on Friday, Feb. 3, at 9 EST. The show, from Stephen J.
Cannell Productions, has the same creative team as ``Wiseguy.''
``Unsub'' is for ``Unknown Subjects.''
   ``Nightingales'' is the first series from Aaron Spelling on
another network since Spelling's longtime contract with ABC expired.
The show, based on the highly rated movie telecast last June, will
air on Wednesday, Jan. 25, at 10 p.m. EST.
   ``My Two Dads'' returns on Wednesday, Jan. 11, at 9:30 p.m. EST,
after leaving the air at the end of the 1987-88 season. It stars
Paul Reiser and Greg Evigan as two young men who learn that one of
them may be the father of Nicole Bradford, 14, played by Staci
Keanan. It also stars Florence Stanley and Dick Butkus.
   The one-hour ``Tattinger's'' reportedly will be turned into a
half-hour situation comedy, but NBC said it could not confirm this.

<TEXT>
   Spanish painter Salvador Dali was admitted
to the emergency unit of a hospital Thursday night suffering from a
stomach hemorrhage and was under medical observation, a hospital
official said.
   The 84-year-old Surrealist painter was being attended by four
doctors at Figueras Hospital, said the hospital's admissions clerk,
who refused to be identified.
   The clerk said the physicians expected to report on Dali's
condition Friday.
   Dali lives at his Galatea Tower mansion in Figueras, a town 60
miles north of Barcelona, the seaside provincial capital in
northeastern Spain.
   He had returned to his home Dec. 14 after spending 16 days
hospitalized in Figueras and Barcelona, being treated for a severe
heart problem aggravated by blood clots in the lung.
   Dali's ``Persistence of Memory'' _ with its limp watches and
barren landscape _ is perhaps the most celebrated Surrealist
painting.

   Two men wearing police uniforms held up an
armored car behind a bank building Thursday and got between $3
million and $5 million in cash, police said.
   The armored car, owned by the Coin Depot Corp. of Elizabeth, was
robbed about 9 a.m. behind the First Fidelity Bank, said James
Knights, a spokesman for the FBI's Newark office.
   The car was dropping off money, said police Capt. James Territo.
   The men tied up the car's three occupants, put them in the back
of the vehicle and drove to an industrial park, where police found
the employees, Knights said. The suspects then switched vehicles and
drove away, Knights said.
   The armored car employees, who were not identified, were found
unharmed after police received a telephone call alerting them that
the car was at the industrial park, Territo said.
   Police were looking for two men who fled in a white van.
   ``We're taking inventory of what was left,'' Territo said. ``They
left coins, which they probably didn't take because of the weight.''

   Electric output at the Perry Nuclear Power
Plant was restored to 100 percent Thursday following a seven-hour
decrease prompted when slightly radioactive gas leaked into a
building, a spokesman said.
   Lee Bailey, a spokesman for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.,
which runs the plant, said no radioative gas was released into the
atmosphere.
   Three plant workers were exposed to radioactivity but were
checked out and reported fine following Wednesday night's leak,
Bailey said.
   He said power was cut to 70 percent at the plant about 10 p.m.
Wednesday when an alarm disclosed an elevated level of radioactivity
in a building. Full output was restored about 5 a.m. Thursday.
   A leak was found in a seal on a 6-inch pipe that carries
radioactive gas to charcoal filters, Bailey said.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson was acquitted
Thursday of all charges in an alleged divorce-fixing scheme that
defense attorneys branded ``a soap opera, not a criminal trial.''
   The federal court jury also acquitted Miss Myerson's lover, Carl
``Andy'' Capasso,'' 43, and former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel, 76, of all charges stemming from an alleged scheme
to fix Capasso's alimony payments.
   Miss Myerson, a former city Cultural Affairs commissioner, took
off her glasses and wiped her eyes as jury forewoman Linda Berardi
read the words ``not guilty'' for each of the five counts against
all three defendants and for a sixth count against Miss Myerson.
   When the final acquittal was announced, a small cheer erupted
from the little group of the defendants' supporters, and Capasso
embraced Miss Myerson.
   Miss Myerson, 64, who was Miss America in 1945, walked the length
of the defense table to embrace the frail retired judge.
   ``I'm grateful for the American judicial system, and I thank the
jury for exonerating me,'' Miss Myerson said outside the courthouse.
   After a startling announcement by the jury that it had not yet
reached a verdict on the key conspiracy count after almost four days
of deliberations, the judge re-read the instructions on reasonable
doubt, at the panel's request.
   Within minutes, the jury sent out a note that it had reached a
verdict and overwhelmingly rejected the prosecution's contention
that the three were guilty of conspiracy, mail fraud and
bribe-related charges.
   The jurors had been sequestered since Monday, when they began
weighing the evidence in the 12-week-old trial.
   Miss Myerson was charged with trying to bribe the judge in
Capasso's divorce case by giving a city job to the judge's daughter,
Sukhreet Gabel.
   Sukhreet Gabel sat with a dazed expression as each verdict was
delivered.
   Miss Myerson, Capasso, a onetime city contractor; and Mrs. Gabel
were charged with plotting to cut Capasso's temporary support
payments to his estranged wife.
   All three were charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and promoting
bribery. Miss Myerson also was charged with obstruction of justice
for allegedly trying to influence the grand jury testimony of
Sukhreet Gabel.
   As the panel left the room, Myerson broke down, sobbing into her
hands as Capasso massaged her neck and back. Capasso, before he was
taken back into custody by federal marshals, offered a one-word
opinion: ``Outstanding.'' The millionaire contractor pleaded guilty
to federal tax evasion charges in January and is serving a
three-year sentence in Lewisburg, Pa.
   ``The jurors were the most conscientious group I have ever seen.
I feel just great,'' said Mrs. Gabel.
   As her daughter congratulated her, the former judge said, ``My
daughter is here and I'm glad she stood by me all the way. ... She
told the truth all the way.''
   ``Everybody's a winner, the truth came out,'' Sukhreet Gabel said.
   Jay Goldberg, Capasso's lawyer, said, ``Had it not been Bess
Myerson, (U.S. Attorney Rudolph) Giuliani would have never brought
this case.''
   Giuliani, whose office has rarely lost a major case, praised the
work of his staff and did not dispute the verdict.
   ``I've never argued with a jury's verdict and will not do so
here,'' said Giuliani. ``The jury concluded there was insufficient
evidence.''
   Giuliani added, ``This case was a case that should have been
tried, should have been brought to a jury. Obviously, we're
disappointed with the result.''
   As for the testimony of Miss Gabel, who admitted her memory was
faulty, Giuliani said, ``You don't have a chance to select your
witnesses ... we were stuck with the witnesses existing in the case.
I made a decision to go ahead.''

<HEAD>Business Tycoon Says He Bought World's Most Valuable Painting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PERTH, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessman Alan Bond said Friday he was
the anonymous buyer of the world's most valuable painting, Vincent
Van Gogh's ``Irises,'' but kept the purchase secret for a year
because he had nowhere to hang it.
   Bond, who won the America's Cup challenge in 1983, said he bought
the oil painting at a Sotheby's auction in New York in November 1987
for a record $50 million but kept the picture under wraps until he
found a place secure enough to satisfy insurers.
   News reports said Bond spent the past year building the most
secure art gallery in Perth, and possibly in all of Australia.
   Bond, who has extensive media and brewery interests, displayed
the painting to reporters on the 49th floor of the R&I Tower,
Perth's tallest skyscraper.
   Since the purchase, Bond said he had received offers for the
masterpiece ``significantly in excess'' of what he paid.
   The Dutch impressionist master painted ``Irises'' in 1889 while
he was in a French asylum.
   Van Gogh is the world's best-selling artist. Five of his
paintings are among the 10 that have fetched the highest prices at
Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses.
   At the time of the sale, Sotheby's said they sold ``Irises'' to
an anonymous buyer for $53.9 million.

<HEAD>Pan Am Bomb Warning Recalls Similar Incident in 1986</HEAD>

   Disclosure that a caller had warned that
someone would unwittingly carry a bomb aboard a Pan Am flight from
Frankfurt to New York recalled an attempt to bomb an Israeli
airliner in 1986.
   Although cause of the Pan Am crash Wednesday in Scotland had not
been determined, investigators were examining terrorist threats and
evidence that the plane exploded in the air before its crashed,
killing 280 people, 258 of them on the plane and the rest on the
ground.
   Jordanian-born Nezar Hindawi was condemned on Oct. 24, 1986 to 45
years in prison for handing booby-trapped hand baggage to his
unwitting pregnant Irish girlfriend as she prepared to board an El
Al flight on April 17 that year.
   An El Al guard found the bomb as the woman, Ann-Marie Murphy,
passed through security. British officials said it consisted of
three pounds of Czechoslovakian-made plastic explosive hidden behind
a luggage panel and likely would have killed all 375 passengers
aboard the EL Al Boeing 747.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Thursday that on
Dec. 5 an anonymous caller told the U.S. Embassy in Finland that a
Pan Am flight would be bombed. She said ``an unidentified person in
Helsinki would unwittingly take the device to Frankfurt and
eventually onto the U.S.-bound flight.''
   However, the department's top counterterrorism official said in a
television interview that it was still not clear whether Pan Am
flight 103 had fallen victim to terrorism, and that authorities
frequently received detailed threats that turned out to be false.
   ``In fact, ever since this method was tried and thwarted on an El
Al plane in London two years ago, we've had a number of times people
come to us saying that someone in an unsuspecting way is going to
carry a bomb on a plane. So it's not unusual to have that kind of
specificity in a threat,'' L. Paul Bremer said in an interview on
Cable News Network.
   Mrs. Oakley said the caller told embassy officials that the
individuals who would provide the device would have ties to Abu
Nidal, leader of a radical Palestinian faction.
   Another source said the caller claimed the bomb would be carried
by a woman.
   The Finnish Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday that an
Arab resident had made several bomb threats during the year, most
recently on Dec. 5, but that ``in the investigation so far, no
direct connection has been found between the Arab living in Finland
and the air accident in question.''
   The statement said authorities knew the caller's identity and
that he had not left Finland since Dec. 5.
   The sentence handed down in the El Al case in 1986 was the
longest ever in a British court.
   During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Hindawi
entered Britain in late January 1986 on a Syrian diplomatic passport
with a false name, and that his visa applications had been endorsed
by Syrian foreign ministry officials.
   The prosecution presented evidence that Hindawi, then 32, was
acting in concert with Syria for a group called the Jordan
Revolutionary Movement. He allegedly received help from the chief of
Syrian Air Force intelligence, Gen. Mohammed Khouli, an aide to
Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Hindawi's former fiancee, Miss Murphy, testified during the
trial, breaking into tears and accusing the defendant of intending
to kill her and their unborn child. The baby, a girl, was born in
July.
   After the bomb was discovered, Hindawi fled to the Syrian
Embassy, where according to the prosecution he met with Syrian
Ambassador Loutof Haydar. Hindawi was then taken to a Syrian safe
house in London, where Syrian embassy employees cut and dyed his
hair. However, he fled in fear and turned himself in to police.
   The incident prompted Britain to sever diplomatic ties with
Syria, and other members of the European Common Market imposed trade
and diplomatic sanctions against that nation in October 1986. The
measures were lifted the following July after Western officials
concluded that Syria had curtailed its support for terrorism.

   Pentagon employees, contractors and defense
consultants regularly deal in a ``black market'' of classified
Defense Department documents, and the government has closed its eyes
to the practice for at least five years, congressional investigators
say.
   A staff report of the congressional Joint Economic Committee,
released Wednesday, said the Pentagon's internal investigators
discovered the practice in 1983 and sought to bring it to the
attention of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and the Justice
Department.
   But efforts to sound the alarm were ignored by higher-ups,
leading some subordinates to believe the practice was condoned,
according to testimony at a hearing of the panel's national security
subcommittee.
   In a practice that strongly parallels the pattern in the current
Pentagon procurement fraud case, outside defense consultants would
develop sources inside the Pentagon who could furnish them with
classified data, the report said. Documents included secret bid
specifications for weapons systems and long-range defense
acquisition plans.

   After asserting innocence for more than two
years, Wall Street powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to
admit guilt to six felonies and pay a record $650 million fine to
settle the biggest securities fraud case in history.
   The plea bargain agreement is the most stunning break yet in a
criminal probe of the nation's fifth-largest investment firm, which
bankrolled some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the decade
through its pioneering use of high-yield ``junk bond'' securities.
   The agreement, announced Wednesday by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani, does not protect Michael Milken, Drexel's senior
high-yield bond executive and a key target of the criminal probe.
   The investigation already has cost Drexel nearly $2 billion in
lost business and legal expenses, sapped morale of its 10,000
employees and seriously undermined what many consider Wall Street's
most aggressive and able financier.

   President Reagan will leave his successor a
spending blueprint which projects that the federal budget can be
balanced by 1993, nine years later than the target Reagan set when
he campaigned for the presidency in 1980.
   Officials, who are putting the finishing touches on the
administration's final budget, said it will call for a deficit of
$92.5 billion for the 1990 fiscal year, which starts next October.
   That would represent a decline from an actual deficit of $155.1
billion in the 1988 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   The narrowing of the gap between government revenues and spending
was accomplished by optimistic economic assumptions which boost the
government's tax take and a combination of spending cuts, increased
user fees and $6 billion in sales of government assets.

   Conservatives, who have pressed President-elect
Bush to place more of their ilk in top jobs, say the leading
candidate for health and human services secretary has assured them
he supports banning most abortions.
   Atlanta educator Louis Sullivan's pledge to oppose abortion, made
to three anti-abortion activist lawmakers, came as Bush was poised
to name additional members to his Cabinet, possibly by Friday.
   Eight Cabinet members have been named, but Bush has six to go:
HHS, transportation, interior, energy, labor and veterans affairs.
Aides said the president-elect wants to appoint a batch of nominees
in the next round instead of announcing people one-by-one.

   In an apparent bid to create a younger more

the ruling Politburo and offered the clearest indication yet that
Solidarity may be reinstated.
   At Wednesday's meeting of the Communist Party's governing Central
Committee, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski announced that the
party would reevaluate its attitude toward the outlawed trade union
federation.
   ``We are saying clearly that we desire to discuss the future
model of the trade union movement _ different from the present _
together with the OPZZ (official union movement) and moderate
leaders of former Solidarity,'' he said.
   Rakowski told committee members to return to local party units
and poll members on the subject of Solidarity and on its chairman,
Lech Walesa.

   Uncle Sam's annual greetings to taxpayers are
ready to be mailed to 101 million Americans, complete with an
estimate of how long taxpayers can expect to spend filling out the
forms.
   The Internal Revenue Service previewed the new tax forms at a
briefing Wednesday, supplying plenty of words of assurance that
taxpayers should find preparing their returns relatively simple this
year compared to the last filing season.
   That's because there are few changes being made in the new forms,
unlike last year when taxpayers had to confront for the first time
the sweeping changes made by the landmark 1986 Tax Reform Act.
   While there had been dire predictions that befuddled taxpayers
would throw up their hands in despair because they couldn't
comprehend the new law, the IRS said the filing process went
relatively smoothly.

<HEAD>A $20 Million Movie Dropped Into His Lap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A old friend happened to drive by Richard
Benjamin's house and drop a $20 million movie in his lap.
   At least that's the way Benjamin tells how he became involved
with ``My Stepmother Was an Alien,'' the year-end release starring
Dan Aykroyd and Kim Basinger. It helps that the old friend was Jerry
Weintraub, founder of the ``instant major'' film company, Weintraub
Entertainment.
   ``Jerry drove down my street one day as I was getting into my
car,'' Benjamin relates. ``He stopped me and said, `I got this
script. You got to do it. I'm not going to take no for an answer.'
   ``It's hard to say no to Jerry. I thought that when somebody
pulls you over, gets out of a car and stands on a street corner,
that's the way you should make a deal.''
   Benjamin had already read a half-finished version of
``Stepmother'' two years before and had admired it.
   ``There's something terrifically real about a little girl saying
to her dad, `But she's from another planet!' And the dad saying,
`Now she's going to be your new mother. Tell me you don't like her
cooking, but don't tell me she's from another planet.' There's
something psychologically right about that,'' he said.
   Benjamin signed on as director. Having directed ``My Favorite
Year,'' ``City Heat,'' ``Racing With the Moon,'' ``The Money Pit''
and ``Little Nikita,'' he now entered the whole new world of special
effects.
   ``John Dykstra and his company, Apogee, that did the special
effects are awesome because they can do anything,'' he said. ``They
would say, `Here's what we think it should be. But what would you
like? This spaceship could be anything you want. The characters can
be anywhere you want them.'
   ``You had to use your imagination, and then you had to be
responsible to that imagination because they could execute it.''
   Aykroyd entered the project early. A ``Saturday Night Live''
alumnus, he is part of the new breed of film comedy actor.
   ``They work fast, and they don't like to do a lot of rehearsal,''
Benjamin observed. ``Neither does Kim, so that was all right.
   ``When we started, Dan said, `Do you want me to put anything else
in, or do you just want the words in the script?' I said, `If you
want to say something, just say it.' I used to keep the camera
rolling at the end of a scene and just let him go. A lot of that
stuff is in the movie.''
   Although he doesn't appear in ``Stepmother,'' Benjamin did a lot
of acting on the set. The reason: he had to portray the special
effects that would be inserted later.
   ``The actors were looking at me with a stick that said `Ship,' ''
explained the director. ``I said, `Now this thing is coming out of
the stars! It's beautiful! It's magnificent! It's awesome!' Then
there are these great superbeings in the sky, and I'm standing on a
ladder doing them.''
   Except for a few gray hairs, Dick Benjamin at 49 still possesses
the preppie look he first displayed in ``Goodbye, Columbus.'' New
York-born, he attended the famed High School for the Performing
Arts, then studied drama at Northwestern University, where he met
his wife, Paula Prentiss.
   After establishing himself in Neil Simon plays (``Barefoot in the
Park,'' ``The Odd Couple,'' ``Star Spangled Girl''), Benjamin made
his film debut in ``Goodbye, Columbus.'' He also appeared in another
Philip Roth story, ``Portnoy's Complaint,'' as well as ``Catch 22,''
``Diary of a Mad Housewife,'' ``Westworld'' and ``Love at First
Bite.''
   He started directing in school and liked it, but his acting
career took over. As a film actor, he repeatedly complained to
Prentiss about mistakes his directors made.
   Her response: ``You ought to put up or shut up.'' Her agent, Phil
Gersh, helped him make the transition.
   ``Yes, I miss acting,'' Benjamin admitted. ``I'd like to do it
again. But it takes at least a year and a half to prepare and direct
a movie, so I just can't find the time.''

   On a soundstage west of London, Mickey
Rooney is sporting a fur shawl, a shaggy white wig _ and a scar on
his forehead.
   It's only makeup, explains the sprightly actor, who's a bit fuzzy
on the details of the script. ``Somebody whacked me, I think, with a
club or a stick or a bat.''
   Rooney, 68, who is in London repeating his starring role in the
Broadway musical ``Sugar Babies,'' picked up a six-day contract to
star among a band of medieval thugs in ``Erik the Viking,'' a $15
million movie which will be released by Orion Pictures next summer.
   The author and director, former Monty Python trouper Terry Jones,
also plays the role of King Arnulf.
   Tim Robbins, the acclaimed sidekick of last summer's hit film
``Bull Durham,'' is the adventurous Erik, on a quest to graduate
from barbarian to nice guy. Rooney plays his grandfather, singer
Eartha Kitt is the soothsayer Freya and John Cleese, another former
Python, is Erik's nemesis, Halfdan the Black.
   The movie is based on a collection of 28 stories about the
fictional Erik which Jones wrote for his young son, Bill.
   Jones, 46, will be remembered by Python fans as the black-haired
one who would play plump old matrons with shrieking voices. With the
breakup of the troupe, he has gone on to directorial fame with
``Personal Services.''
   He says his latest film is less a children's story than an
extension of the ``Indiana Jones'' sagas, which combine comedy,
fantasy and adventure.
   ``It's the kind of thing I would enjoy seeing,'' said the
Oxford-educated Welshman, who was busy on the set one recent day
marshaling characters with Pythonesque names such as Sven the
Berserk, Ulf the Maddeningly Calm and Lief the Lucky.
   Jones was shooting the final scene in which the Dark Ages, the
so-called Age of Ragnarok, come to a triumphant end with the sudden
emergence of the sun _and enlightenment for Erik.
   The setting is the Vikings' home village of Valhalla in Norway, a
community marked by constant winter and warfare. The film begins
with a rape followed by plenty of the kind of bloodshed and
dismemberment familiar to Python addicts.
   Jones knows he is courting outcry from campaigners against screen
violence, but says, ``There's violence in life. I don't think that's
what corrupting. When people glory in violence I get disturbed.''
   The film spent four weeks on location in Malta creating an
enchanted island called Hy-Brasil, but a decision was made against
location shooting in Norway in favor of studio work.
   Rooney was eager to make clear he isn't taking his role too
seriously.
   ``It's a lot of fun being with John Cleese and Terry,'' he said
in an interview. ``I haven't even read the script; I don't know
anything about it. I like good humor; I'm a guy that loves good
humor.
   ``And I love the money.''
   Producer John Goldstone said that unlike the Monty Python skits,
the Viking movie is a real story with a beginning, a middle, and an
end. Goldstone first worked with Jones in 1974 on ``Monty Python and
the Holy Grail,'' which cost just 229,000 pounds (then about
$535,000).
   ``Erik the Viking'' is the last of three films made by Python
alumni in the past 12 months. Cleese's ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' was
a summer box-office hit, and Terry Gilliam's ``The Adventures of
Baron Munchausen,'' has just opened in West Germany to mixed reviews.
   ``We'd like to have three successful films,'' said Jones, ``but
one mustn't count one's chickens.''

<HEAD>London's Longest-Running Comedy Prepares For Broadway</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ray Cooney's ``Run for Your Wife,'' the
longest-running comedy on the London stage, is Broadway-bound after
six years on the West End.
   ``It's so readily acceptable; that's what people relate to,''
Cooney, 56, said of his farce about a bigamous taxi driver.
   ``It can be summed up so simply,'' he said. ``People can
understand the dilemma of an innocent guy who, because he didn't
have the heart to say no, has got two wives.''
   Cooney last went to Broadway with his 1967 London hit ``Not Now,
Darling,'' but it closed after just six weeks.
   ``Run for Your Wife'' starts previews at New York's Virginia
Theater Feb. 22, opening March 7, after a tryout stint Jan. 17 to
Feb. 19 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami.
   Cooney directs and stars alongside Paxton Whitehead, an alumnus
of the hit Broadway and London farce ``Noises Off.''
   After such successes as ``Move Over, Mrs. Markham,'' co-written
with John Chapman, ``Two Into One'' and ``Wife Begins at Forty,''
Cooney believes he is ready to try Broadway again.
   ``My plays are pure situation,'' he said. ``There are no local
jokes.''
   ``Run for Your Wife'' has been slated for Broadway for years, and
Cooney has directed it in productions in New Jersey with David
McCallum, in Baltimore with Bob Dishy and at Oakbrook, outside
Chicago.
   But Cooney said only now had talent and script meshed properly.
Under a special agreement with the American actors' union, Equity,
three British actors will appear in the play for four months on
Broadway, at which point the five Americans completing the New York
line-up will transfer to the London production at the Criterion
Theater.
   While emphasizing his play is a farce, Cooney said ``Run for Your
Wife'' had a darker underside.
   ``My farces are really inverted tragedies,'' said Cooney, a
London-born carpenter's son who left school when he was 14 to become
an actor.
   ``If the story of this bigamist had been written by Tennessee
Williams, it would be a tragedy,'' said Cooney, pointing out that
his twice-married cabbie has committed a criminal offense for which
he could go to jail.
   ``If you're going to write a pure, for want of a better word,
farce, I think it does need to have tragedy at its core.''
   ``Run for Your Wife'' will be one of several farces on Broadway
this season. Neil Simon's ``Rumors'' surmounted mixed reviews to
become a smash hit at the Broadhurst Theater.
   Ken Ludwig's ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' an American comedy which ran
successfully in London, opens at the Royale Theater the night before
``Run for Your Wife.''
   Cooney said the best farce has a strong basic plot.
   ``All my plays take place in real time and usually start at quite
a high dramatic point. There's a lot at stake (for the characters)
in them.''
   Because he's wearing a triple cap, the play's budget is $600,000,
unusually low for Broadway. It breaks even at 36 percent of capacity
and, with full houses, can recoup its investment in just six weeks.
   ``If Broadway's going to have plays produced there, everybody's
got to chip in,'' said Cooney, who is forgoing all royalties for a
share of the profits.
   Regardless of whether ``Run for Your Wife'' runs, Cooney's next
play is ready to go. ``It Runs in the Family'' is a comedy about an
adolescent who at age 18 discovers his father's true identity.
   He said the play, to open on the West End next fall, was ``at
heart, a drama.''
   ``I just happen to write these plays because I see the funny side
of the dramas around us,'' he said. ``I have a feeling there's
enough depressing news when I switch the TV on.''

<HEAD>Samantha Fox Just Wants to Have Fun</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELISSA M. VECCHIONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Samantha Fox's latest hit single, ``I Wanna Have
Some Fun,'' expresses the young singer's carefree philosophy.
   ``I'm a very happy person. There are not many things that really
upset me,'' the 22-year-old British rocker says. ``Everything I do I
seem to enjoy. I'm a really lucky person to be in job that I really
enjoy.''
   Her single is fast climbing the charts, following the success of
``Naughty Girls Need Love'' and ``Touch Me.''
   ``I Wanna Have Some Fun,'' her third LP, is Fox's favorite album.
She also calls it her best. ``I think I've just improved musically.
You don't know what sound is coming next after each record.''
   The numerous producers of ``I Wanna Have Some Fun'' give the
album a special variety in sounds and styles, and include Full
Force, Fred Zarr and the team of Stock, Aitkin and Waterman, who
also produce Rick Astley and Bananarama.
   Fox also had a lot of freedom on this album. ``I just go to the
studio and sing how I want to sing, they don't really tell me how to
do anything,'' she said. ``I make up my own style with their style
of music.''
   Most of her music doesn't carry meaningful messages or lyrics,
but she does hope her listeners understand the importance of
enjoying their youth. ``Be careful, but have a good time,'' she
says. ``Every young girl or boy should be having fun.''
   Fox grew up in London. Her father, Pat, worked in construction,
carpentry and building refurbishing. Her mother, Carol, was a
homemaker. Both parents now work full time managing their daughter's
career.
   Fox began modeling when she was about 15. She went on to become
one of England's favorite ``Page 3 girls,'' the topless models
featured regularly on page 3 of The Sun newspaper. When her modeling
career began to really take off, she dropped out of school and has
had no desire for further formal education.
   ``I saw stars and went,'' she said. ``I've learned more traveling
the world and being with people a lot older than me and in the
business than I would have learned in school.''
   Her popularity as a model attracted music executives, and it
wasn't long before she was offered a contract. But singing spelled
an end to modeling.
   Though she lives alone in an apartment in London, she doesn't
stray too far from her family. Her younger sister, Vanessa, helps
the Foxes with the business which includes not only Samantha's
recording career and performances but also calendars, clothing,
posters and other paraphernalia fans crave.
   Fox's popularity is so enormous in England that she often has
problems with privacy. She plans to sell a country home because fans
found out about it and it's no longer the safe hideaway she intended
it to be.
   ``I'm news, everything I do they want to write about,'' she said.
   In the meantime, she's beginning to look at a movie career, and
will do screen tests for an undisclosed project. And with what
little free time she has available, Fox fills it with workouts,
swimming, movies, concerts and writing songs. She also likes fast
cars.
   ``That's what I'd like to do, you know, speed car racing. I'd
love a motorbike really,'' she says glancing at her father who
responds, ``That is out of the question.''
   She's planning at least five more albums, but she's not sure what
will develop after that.
   ``I don't know what I want to do in five years. Who knows, I
might meet the man of my dreams and get married,'' she said.
   And who might that ideal man be? Actor Mickey Rourke, she said.
But first she has to meet him.

<HEAD>Saudi-Soviet Relations May Be Restored After 50 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALY MAHMOUD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meetings between Saudi Arabia,
anti-communist guardian of Islam's holiest shrines, and the
officially atheist Soviet Union have inspired predictions of an end
to their 50-year-old break in relations.
   Officials in Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's richest nation, will
not discuss their intentions openly but King Fahd met with Yuli
Vorontsov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister, on Dec. 5.
   It was the highest-level contact since Josef Stalin's government
broke relations in 1938, after having been the first to recognize
what was called the kingdom of the Hijaz 12 years earlier.
   The Dec. 5 meeting climaxed two years of political courtship by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev as part of an effort to increase
Soviet influence in the Persian Gulf region, which contains nearly
60 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.
   Resuming relations with Saudi Arabia, the non-communist world's
leading oil exporter and a U.S. ally of long standing, would be a
triumph for Gorbachev.
   Before seeing Fahd, Voronstov met with Moslem Afghan guerrillas,
under Saudi sponsorship, in the Taif Mountain resort.
   Saudi leaders have insisted the Soviets end their 9-year-old
military involvement in Afghanistan as a condition for resuming
relations. The Red Army began withdrawing May 15 under a
U.N.-mediated agreement.
   Knowledgeable sources in Riyadh said the main Soviet reason for
meeting Afghan insurgent leaders in Taif was to please the Saudis.
   The official Saudi Press Agency quoted Vorontsov as telling Fahd,
``The Soviet Union is determined to withdraw its forces from
Afghanistan at the time already fixed or perhaps earlier.''
   A Western diplomat said privately: ``If the withdrawal is
completed in February, it seems they're likely to resume relations.''
   By terms of the withdrawal agreement signed April 14 in Geneva,
half the Soviet Union's more than 100,000 soldiers were withdrawn
from Afghanistan by Aug. 15 and the rest must be out by Feb. 15.
   Saudi Arabia has been among the staunchest supporters of the
Moslem insurgents, who began fighting after a communist coup in
April 1978.
   Other Western and Arab diplomats believe the Saudis are more
likely to establish diplomatic ties with China, which has sold
Riyadh intermediate-range ballistic missiles, before resuming
relations with Moscow.
   Frank Carlucci, the departing U.S. defense secretary, recently
paid a last visit to Saudi Arabia. Reports said he asked Fahd if the
Taif meetings meant relations with Moscow were imminent and was told
the matters were not related.
   An Arab diplomat, also speaking privately, said: ``It's now a
question of the right price. China may have paid with the missiles
and with the Soviets it might well be a complete withdrawal from
Afghanistan.''
   Prince Salman, Fahd's brother and governor of Riyadh, said: ``The
Saudi-Soviet dialogue has never been suspended despite the rupture
in diplomatic ties between the countries.''
   Al-Anbaa, a Kuwaiti newspaper, quoted the Soviet ambassador to
the emirate, Ernest Zverev, as saying efforts were under way ``to
normalize relations,'' but ``so far we haven't received an official
gesture from Saudi Arabia concerning diplomatic representation.''
   For more than four decades after Stalin ended formal relations,
theocratic Saudi Arabia shunned diplomatic ties with communist
governments.
   Saudi officials resumed contacts with the communist world in the
early 1980s to discuss the Palestinian question and the arms embargo
King Fahd's government sought to impose on Iran in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister, visited Moscow in
1982 and again in 1988. Oil Minister Hisham Nazer went there this
year, and the Soviets have become major purchasers of Saudi wheat.
   Vladimir Polyakov, Soviet undersecretary for Middle East affairs,
held ``cooperation talks'' with senior Saudis in Riyadh in February.
Arab diplomats said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will
visit the Saudi capital next month.
   The United States remains a major arms supplier for Arab nations
in the Persian Gulf, but congressional blocking of advanced weapon
sales has forced them to look to the Soviets, French and British.
   Kuwait established relations with Moscow nearly 30 years ago, in
1960, and the United Arab Emirates and Qatar did so more recently.
Those conservative governments also have relations with China.

<HEAD>Senate Will Convene Minus Maverick Weicker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate will convene next month minus one of
its genuine mavericks _ the blunt and bombastic Lowell Weicker.
   Faithful friend to underdogs, outcasts and causes not in vogue,
the imposing, 6-foot-6 Connecticut Republican was a master of
theatrical floor performances and shrewd backroom negotiating. He
practiced both on two key committees _ Appropriations, and Labor and
Human Resources.
   ``He could fight in the trenches with the best of them. He liked
being involved in the fray,'' said Ralph Neas, executive director of
the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. ``He was one of a kind.
And it will be much more difficult (for us) without him.''
   Loyal to nothing but his own unshakeable beliefs, Weicker
alienated many of his GOP colleagues and ultimately lost his
three-term grip on Connecticut voters. They are sending Democrat
Joseph Lieberman _ a more traditional politician _ to the Senate in
January.
   Without Weicker, Senate visitors will be deprived of some
dramatic entertainment. And those whose causes he championed,
tenaciously and sometimes pugnaciously, are bereft.
   ``He certainly stuck out his neck a lot farther than most,'' said
Barry W. Lynn, chief lobbyist for the American Civil Liberties
Union. ``He was one of the few members of the Senate who had an
instinctive sense of constitutional violation. ... And he was a guy
who could actually persuade people to change their views.''
   Lynn credits Weicker with heading off constitutional amendments
proposed during President Reagan's first term that would have
required school prayer or silent meditation.
   ``He alone was responsible for the success of the education of
the public,'' Lynn said. ``He was a one-man orchestrator of
sufficient delay to let people's better instincts prevail.'' And if
that had failed? ``Everyone realized he was prepared to do a
filibuster.''
   Weicker did in fact wage a filibuster for nine months in 1981,
staving off conservative attempts to strip the Supreme Court of
jurisdiction over school desegregation. ``What was important to him
was protecting the Constitution, not necessarily being the most
popular member of the club,'' said Neas.
   That he was not.
   He was more like a charging bull in the china shop of Senate
civility, spouting thinly veiled insults and self-righteousness,
particularly in his dealings with conservative colleagues such as
Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire.
   ``An exercise in bigotry, period ... about the most objectionable
thing I've seen on the Senate floor,'' he fumed last July of a
Humphrey amendment that said federally funded AIDS education
materials could not ``use words stating that homosexuality is
`normal,' `natural' or `healthy.'''
   Helms was reproached after stating in an earlier debate that ``I
may throw up'' over AIDS materials produced by a homosexual group.
``We don't have time to get into ... moralistic debates,'' Weicker
lectured. ``If somebody's ill, then they deserve the help of their
government. Period. Over and out.''
   Not that Weicker was above moralizing _ on AIDS, civil rights,
civil liberties, abortion, federal health and education spending, or
any number of other matters on which he felt strongly.
   ``What the hell could be more important than 1.5 million people
who are going to die?'' Weicker exploded once when former Senate
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia sought to move off
an AIDS bill for a brief vote on an unrelated matter.
   To those who tried to exempt some federal aid recipients from
complying with civil rights laws, Weicker had this to say: ``If you
can't get it knocked through your head that discrimination is out in
this nation, period, then you don't deserve the help of the American
people.''
   Colleagues who might have preferred more of a team player give
him credit for sincerity, at least. ``He believed in what he was
doing, and I admire people who stand up for their beliefs,'' said
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the senior Republican on the Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   One of Weicker's less flamboyant crusades was the disability
rights movement, for which he and his staff wrote programs and laws
and secured the money to carry them out. But even that cause was
controversial in the budget-cutting Reagan years.
   Paul Marchand, chief lobbyist for the Association for Retarded
Citizens, said disability groups were among the few that emerged
unscathed from the Reagan era due to Weicker's efforts. ``He never
lost for us,'' Marchand said. ``He may have alienated people. That
was out of our control. The bottom line is that he never lost for
us.''
   One of the last things Weicker did before his defeat was persuade
Congress, in its waning hours, to extend a $15 million program
making the drug AZT available to AIDS patients. It was a typical
Weicker performance, fraught with urgency and melodrama.
   ``He just got up on the floor of the Senate and said `we have to
do this or people are going to die' _ and it was done,'' said Jeff
Levi, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``He did it, and no one else did.''

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC has figured out a way around those low
Nielsen ratings for news specials _ produce one for a potentially
vast new audience in outer space.
   No kidding. ``The Koppel Report: News From Earth,'' beamed by ABC
on Monday, is a year-in-review by Earthlings for any alien
intelligence out there that might tune in, demographics unknown.
   It might seem a silly notion, but it is an often enlightening and
occasionally amusing hour of self-examination that, who knows? might
be the first interplanetary newsmagazine. And what better Earthling
to represent us than Ted Koppel? Unless Mean Joe Greene. Or perhaps
Pat Sajak and Vanna White.
   See, while newspapers pile up in a corner and turn yellow, a
television signal travels into space at 186,000 miles per second.
``The thought may fascinate or horrify you,'' says Koppel, in an
aside to fellow Earthlings who are probably more fascinated and
horrified by the absence of ``Monday Night Football,'' ``but what if
someday, a thousand light-years from now, some alien intelligence
decoded the signal?''
   In case they do, Koppel and guests address themselves to
extraterrestrial viewers: ``So what do we tell you, out there in the
far reaches of space, about us and our planet? Well, for one thing,
by the time you see this we'll all be long dead,'' Koppel informs
them cheerily.
   ``During this year just past, we took detailed note of a great
many things that were so important to us, and must seem so
irrelevant to you,'' says Koppel, explaining the concept of the
year-end wrapup. No doubt many here on Earth found such news nuggets
as the resignation of U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese just as
relevant as Venutians will.
   But if our next-solar-system neighbors pick up ``News from
Earth,'' they'll hear, among others, Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
on AIDS, environmentalist Jean-Michel Cousteau on pollution,
fast-talking comedian John Moschitta on stress, South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu on racism, Billy Graham on God, Vladimir
Pozner on no-God, and Richard Nixon on U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The only prominent women on the program are the United Nations
representative from Barbados, Dame Nita Barrow, who talks about
hunger in the Third World, and anthropologist Jane Goodall, who
discusses endangered species. A message to aliens: the sexual
balance of the program notwithstanding, females are not on the
endangered list.
   Passers-by in person-on-the-street mostly act silly when offered
the chance to talk to their neighbors on other planets. ``If there's
anybody out there,'' giggles one harried woman, ``come get me.'' A
man who can turn his hands upside-down on his head and encircle his
eyes instructs the aliens to disregard all others, he is the true
leader of the planet. A segment on narcissism is illustrated by a
montage of TV commercials: ``I'd like to get rid of this gray, but I
don't want a total dye job and look ridiculous.''
   Koppel and company cover just about everything. The only apparent
oversight is not taking the opportunity to issue an invitation to
the Miss Universe Pageant.
   Half-way through the program, Koppel gives an update on those
travelin' TV signals, which, he estimates are ``well past Mars, a
mere five minutes from Jupiter and half-way to Saturn.''
   ``We think about you all the time,'' Koppel tells outerspace
audiences, introducing a segment on earthly fascination with UFOs
illustrated with clips of sci-fi movies, from ``War of the Worlds''
to ``E.T., The Extra-Terrestrial.''
   But he does offer in conclusion ``a confession.'' ``This program
was designed much more for us on Earth than for you,'' he says.
   ``Sending messages out to the farthest reaches of the universe,
or even to generations yet unborn here on Earth, is ... a function
of faith. It presumes that life goes on, either here or somewhere,
and that you will feel some kinship to us and what was important to
us. We have a great need to feel that this is so.''
   Nor does Koppel warn our neighbors light-years away that if they
do receive the signal for ``News from Earth,'' they may soon be
subjected to a strange and uncontrollable forces from our planet _
A.C. Nielsen Co. representatives looking to wire them up.

<TEXT>
   Former IBM Corp. Vice Chairman Paul Rizzo
wants to put the business school at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill on the map, and even has hired a public relations
firm to help promote the school.
   ``This school ... has been able to attract quality students
without promoting itself,'' he said. ``This no longer works. When
our students come here, one of the first things they want to know is
our placement record.''
   When he became dean of the school, Rizzo said his top priority
was to make the school a vital cog in the state's business
community. But as any successful executive knows, first things first.
   ``If we're going to compete, we need to play the game,'' said the
1950 graduate of UNC who lined up in the same backfield as Charlie
``Choo Choo'' Justice on the Tar Heel football team. ``We don't want
to be second-rate.''
   Rizzo was impressed with the faculty when he took the job in
September 1987. At the same time, he understood why some had left.
   ``With all of the problems of a state university, including the
bureaucracy and underfunding, we have still managed to build a high
quality faculty,'' he said in a recent telephone interview from his
office in Chapel Hill. ``We're in danger of losing them.''
   Rizzo said money was only one reason why talented professors were
leaving the school for other opportunities. That's why he is the
chief proponent of a plan to construct a new home for the business
school at a cost of between $20 million and $30 million.
   ``We've got a major-league faculty with a bush-league facility,''
he said. ``A new building would be practically and symbolically very
important.
   ``Just like a good medical school, a business school can't be
successful without significant clinical activity,'' he said. ``Other
business schools may be too lavish, but if we're going to conduct
programs with the corporate world, we need adequate facilities.''
   Despite those obstacles, the business school recently was ranked
No. 8 in the country in a poll of 3,000 MBAs conducted by
BusinessWeek magazine.
   Rizzo has put his stamp on the school's curriculum, giving it
what he described as a ``global perspective.''
   ``A globalization of the curriculum is not unique to this
business school,'' he said, explaining that any reputable business
school could not ignore the study of international business in the
late 1980s.
   The school also has introduced the International Executive
Series, a program which brings in business leaders from such
countries as Japan and the Soviet Union, as well as prominent
American corporate executives who have worked overseas.
   The first lecture last month was given by Kenichi Ohmae,
management director of McKinsey & Co. of Tokyo. The subject: ``Do
Trade Deficits Really Matter in a Global Economy?''
   Other speakers include V.F. Lishchenko of the Academy of Sciences
of the U.S.S.R. in Moscow; S. Parker Gilbert, chairman of Morgan
Stanley Group Inc.; Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Officer James
Burke; IBM Corp. Chairman and CEO John Akers; and John Welch,
chairman of General Electric.
   Rizzo wants to encourage more faculty and students from the
business school to work and study abroad, and he wants to bring in
more foreigners to teach and study at the school.
   ``The impact of culture on business is important,'' he said.
``Just learning the language is not enough. We need to develop an
appreciation for the things we don't understand because we lack the
cultural background.''
   For example, he said, the conversation at a business lunch in
some European countries may focus on music or literature, not the
latest leveraged buyout or stock tip.
   ``It's easy to pick up the phone and do business in this country
because we speak the same language,'' Rizzo said. ``Building
relationships in other countries can be difficult. We need people
groping and struggling to do business effectively in the foreign
marketplace.''
   The school's reputation seems to be improving, as evidenced by
its move up in the BusinessWeek rankings from the top 15 last year
to the top 10. In addition, a Washington, D.C., public relations
firm, Peabody Fitzpatrick Communications Inc., is hard at work
promoting the international lecture series among other projects.
   ``To be this good, given all the drawbacks we have, is
remarkable,'' Rizzo said.

   By week's end, a presidential panel is to
recommend to the Pentagon how many and which of 3,800 military bases
around the country should be closed. Many jobs will be lost, but the
anticipated savings to taxpayers could be $5 billion a year. Two
decades ago, base closings were relatively common, until Congress
started blocking individual closings to spare their constituents.
For side-by-side stories, The Associated Press went back to towns
that lost their bases in the '60s. Moses Lake, Wash., survived and
prospered; Edgemont, S.D., is still trying to replace that big
payroll. Both provide examples for the towns about to get word from
the Pentagon.

   The lumbering Japan Air Lines 747 drones
over bustling Grant County Mall on its landing approach, the most
dramatic sign that this remote little town has survived and
prospered since Larson Air Force Base closed in 1966.
   Locals once feared the closure would dry up their ``Desert
Oasis,'' but many now say they are glad the Air Force is gone.
   With recommendations expected this week on which of 3,800
military bases the Pentagon should shut down to save $2 billion to
$5 billion a year, anxious towns around the country could look to
Moses Lake's economic recovery as a model.
   Once a home for B-52 bombers, the old base is now a jet pilot
training center, an aircraft testing site, a community college, a
housing development, a municipal airport and an industrial park
that, ironically, includes the Air Force as a tenant.
   While Larson provided only 38 civilian jobs before closing, the
diversified site now supports 825 workers.
   ``We're a heck of a lot better off now that the base is closed,''
said Robert Trask, an insurance agent in the area for 42 years. ``An
air base isn't the greatest thing in the world.''
   Most of Larson's 4,000 airmen lived on the base and spent their
money at the base stores, rather than in town, he said.
   ``Taverns and used car lots miss them the most,'' Trask said.
   But those sentiments were not in evidence when the shutdown
shocked this town of 10,600, located in the Columbia River basin 150
miles east of Seattle.
   Originally created as an Army Air Corps base in World War II,
Larson was the biggest employer in what was little more than arid
semi-desert before irrigation projects brought cultivation in the
1930s.
   ``The initial years after the closure of Larson Air Force Base
were not an easy time,'' said Karen Wagner of the local Chamber of
Commerce.
   Larson was among 3,600 installations the Defense Department shut
down from 1961 to 1977. But no bases have closed since because
members of Congress, loathe to upset constituents by taking away
jobs, have blocked the Pentagon from closing individual facilities.
   In 1986, the Defense Department issued a report looking at 100 of
the bases that closed before 1977.
   ``You never can really replace the military jobs,'' said Wally
Bishop of the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment in
Washington, D.C.
   But the report found that new civilian jobs outnumbered the lost
civilian jobs 138,138 to 93,424 because of diversification at the
100 sites.
   Replacing those civilian jobs is considered the sign of success,
Bishop said. Still, many communities were not able to do that.
   The Black Hills Army Depot in Edgemont, S.D., went from 512
civilian jobs to eight. Closing the Frankford Arsenal in
Philadelphia cost 2,800 jobs, shutting the Erie Army Depot in Ohio
cost 885 jobs, and tiny Glasgow, Mont., lost 239 jobs when its Air
Force base closed.
   Residents of Moses Lake were determined to escape that fate.
   The first thing leaders did was organize, said Clyde Owen, the
Air Force colonel who closed the base then became the first director
of the newly formed Port of Moses Lake.
   The port, which has taxing authority, was created to buy or
otherwise acquire base facilities from the government and to manage
them, Owen said.
   ``You have to know what you want, and know who to deal with,''
Owen said.
   Ideas like turning the hangers into a cattle feedlot were
rejected, said port commissioner Leon Bodie.
   ``Its best use was as an airfield,'' Bodie said.
   Their first major client, the Seattle-based Boeing Co., was
already using Larson's runways for routine flight testing. About to
unveil its new 747 model, Boeing urgently needed a long runway and
uncluttered skies for testing and to train the pilots of its
potential client airlines.
   Boeing put up $120,000, which basically got the port through its
first year. Since that time, 280 airlines have trained pilots at
Moses Lake, according to port officials.
   One of those, Japan Air Lines, established a permanent 747
training center at the port in 1968, with two dozen full-time
employees and a rotating series of pilot trainees who give the
little town a touch of the Far East.
   They also give it more than a touch of noise pollution, as huge
jets scream over town all day with trainees making touch-and-go
landings at the airport for hours at a time.
   ``People in town on the whole don't worry a bit about the
noise,'' Owen said. ``They know it's revenue-producing.''
   Airlines pay the port $37.50 each time one of their planes takes
off or lands on the 13,000-foot runway.
   JAL is by far the biggest user, paying landing fees of $392,000
in fiscal 1988. The Air Force pays $84,000 a year to rent hangar
space and train pilots on landing.
   The port's 1988 income included $667,00 in landing fees, $94,000
in jet fuel sales, $673,000 in space rental and $274,000 in other
income, for a total of $1.7 million.
   Major commercial tenants on the 4,500-acre site include
Sundstrand Data Control, Boeing, Union Carbide and Columbia Steel
Fabricators.
   There is a corrugated box manufacturer, an aircraft parts maker,
a potato processor and a soft drink distributor. The old hospital is
rented to a day- care center.
   Manufacturers are attracted by the nation's lowest electricity
rates, thanks to the local public utility's share in two Columbia
River dams.
   Also on the former base is Big Bend Community College, which has
140 employees and 1,200 students.
   The school uses former base buildings, including the theater,
cafeteria and dormitories. The old bowling alley is now a science
and math building. The airmen's club is a student center.
   The school also set up a commercial pilot training program
shortly after Larson closed to take advantage of the runway and
hangars; 10 percent of the student body is now enrolled in that
program, said spokesman Doug Sly.
   For all the good news, the area will never be able to replace the
4,000 lost military jobs, Owen said. The base's $14 million budget
in the early 1960s would likely top $100 million in today's money,
he said.
   By contrast, the current annual payroll is probably $3 million to
$4 million.
   But if the base were still around, Moses Lake would have little
incentive to pursue economic diversificiation, Ms. Wagner said.
   Trask, the insurance agent, says good riddance.
   ``The town generates more money now,'' he said.

   In the two decades since an Army ammunition
depot closed and stripped this town of more than 500 jobs, Edgemont
has tried to find another healthy payroll, even courting a string of
potentially hazardous industries.
   A uranium mining and milling operation succeeded for a while,
then closed. Town leaders also wooed companies that proposed a
low-level nuclear waste dump, a sewage ash processing plant, a
munitions testing site and, most recently, a landfill for municipal
waste from Northeastern cities.
   For various reasons, including opposition from environmental
groups, all the proposals failed. A farmer raised pigs on the base
for a time but recently pulled out because of falling pork prices.
   ``We need more jobs, and we're still looking,'' Mayor Pete Ziemet
said. ``The only thing we have going for us, which I guess is both
bad and good, is the notoriety Edgemont has had.''
   Other civic leaders fear they may never find the industry needed
to fill the empty houses and stores in this town sitting on the
southern edge of the Black Hills, where pine-covered mountains give
way to rough grasslands covered with sagebrush and yucca plants.
   ``Everything just seemed to go haywire. ... Just little by
little, everything went wrong,'' said former Mayor Matt Brown.
``I've been here all my life, and so help me God, I can't put my
finger on anything that will salvage the town. Maybe we can be
lucky.''
   A Defense Department survey of 100 communities that lost military
bases from 1961 to 1977 reported that some towns prospered by
converting the bases to other uses. But Edgemont is one of the
places that has never recovered after the military left town.
   The Black Hills Army Depot, which stored ammunition in concrete
bunkers at a place called Igloo eight miles south of Edgemont, was
opened in the 1940s and closed in 1967. Brown said Edgemont not only
lost 500-odd civilian jobs but also many long-time Edgemont
residents who were transferred to civilian jobs at other military
bases.
   Four local businessmen bought the 15,000-acre base to prepare it
for other uses, but it still lies empty. Rows of concrete igloos sit
like loaves of bread on the prairie. Near the base entrance, houses
and administrative buildings are falling apart.
   Edgemont's population grew to 1,772 by 1960, but fell to less
than 1,200 within a few years of the base's closing.
   The town's economy and population recovered in the 1970s, with
the uranium mill and a Burlington Northern Railroad crew-shift
station both busy. Ziemet estimates Edgemont now has only 1,130
people, a drop of about 20 percent since 1980.
   The mayor said 70 houses out of several hundred in town are
empty, and 27 should be razed because they're falling apart. People
trying to sell homes will be lucky to get 50 cents on the dollar, he
said.
   The railroad is still a bright spot in the local economy.
Burlington Northern switches crews at Edgemont and provides a good
national connection, Ziemet said.
   The uranium operation closed due to lack of demand, and the 110
people now cleaning up uranium tailings will be out of work when the
cleanup is completed next year, he said.
   City and state officials have provided financing to help re-open
a factory that makes wooden bowls and other items from walnut, and
the plant should employ up to 30 people.
   But the town has yet to find an industrial use for the abandoned
ammunition depot.
   Cattle are grazed on the base, but an operation that raised hogs
in the concrete igloos has been stopped at least temporarily. A plan
to use the igloos for grain storage also washed out, Ziemet said.
   In 1983, Chem-Nuclear Systems Inc. proposed burying up to
one-third of the nation's low-level nuclear waste at the base. The
plan was scrapped after geological tests showed the site was
unsuitable, and state voters rejected a proposed multi-state compact
that would have allowed the dump.
   Consolidated Management Corp. of Reno, Nev., last year hauled
almost 300,000 tons of incinerated sewage from St. Paul, Minn., to
the old base, where the company planned to build a plant to extract
gold and other precious metals from the ash. The company missed
several deadlines to start the plant, however, and the state now is
searching for a way to dispose of the ash.
   Honeywell Inc. wanted to set up a munitions testing operation in
a canyon near Edgemont but abandoned the plan after a coalition of
Indians and others opposed it.
   Edgemont now is working with South Dakota Disposal Systems Inc.,
headquartered in Colorado, on a plan to bury 1 million tons of
municipal garbage a year. Edgemont could get more than $1 million a
year from the plan, which also would create up to 50 jobs, company
officials have said.
   The succession of proposals dealing with hazardous materials has
angered some local residents and environmental groups across South
Dakota.
   Ruth Kern, who lives on a ranch south of town and opposes all the
waste disposal ideas, said Edgemont is gaining a reputation as a
place willing to become the nation's dumping ground.
   Kern said residents are partly responsible for the base closing
20 years ago because they complained all the time and didn't want
the ``riffraff'' from the base in town. She criticized Edgemont
officials for seeking hazardous dumps that she said wouldn't provide
enough jobs to save the town in any event.
   ``I don't want to see it go under, but neither can I support it
when they want to do something to pollute my environment,'' Kern
said. ``I'm tired of having everybody in the United States look at
us as someplace they can bring in stuff to dump.''
   Kern's stance has drawn criticism from townspeople who want jobs,
whatever the industry. Brown is upset that environmental groups have
been able to block virtually all the town's industrial proposals.
   ``For some reason, we can't seem to whip it,'' he said. ``I'd
like to win one for a change.''
   Ziemet, who's been mayor for the past decade, said he wouldn't
support any industry that would contaminate ground, air or water,
but he believes state and federal officials can make sure the
proposed garbage dump is operated safely.
   Some of the national publicity has upset Ziemet and others.
   A recent Wall Street Journal story said the state and town acted
too hastily when they allowed the Minnesota sewage ash to be hauled
to the abandoned base. Ziemet said no one could know the company
would run out of money before it built the processing plant, which
he said would have been an environmentalist's dream had it succeeded
in tranforming sewage into worthwhile products.
   He compared the town's situation to someone without a job. No one
would criticize the person for taking a job on a garbage truck, he
said.
   ``All we want is a job,'' he repeated. ``I believe something is
going to come.''

   With the roar of cars from Interstate 87 behind
him, Richard DeSimone had 25 city sixth-graders bend over to look in
the mud for traffic of a quieter kind.
   ``A muskrat's been here,'' he told them, pointing out a pawprint
with a line through it, evidence of a muskrat dragging its tail.
DeSimone then showed them footprints made by a raccoon. The children
jockeyed for views.
   In Van Cortlandt Park, an oasis in the Bronx that has been home
to animals ranging from snapping turtles to two white-tailed deer
spotted last year, DeSimone taught the children to be nature
detectives and park stewards.
   He is one of New York City's 68 urban park rangers, a group of
goodwill ambassadors that has educated tens of thousands of city
dwellers about the nature around them.
   The program in the nation's largest city, now in its 10th year,
has become a model. Park ranger programs have started in about 15
cities, including Seattle, Philadelphia, Boston and Cleveland. The
programs are independent from the National Park Service, which
oversees federal wilderness areas.
   ``Park rangers are such a welcome and comforting force in any
park,'' said Mary Kimmitt, deputy director of the Philadelphia
Ranger Corps, which started a year ago.
   In some areas, the presence of rangers helps keep down the crime
rate. In New York's Central Park, for instance, the number of
felonies dropped 28 percent in the last four years; robberies alone
fell 40 percent.
   ``We're trying to get people back in the parks,'' said Therese
Braddick, director of New York's urban rangers. ``Some people
believe they're not safe, and at night many areas aren't.''
   Still, while law enforcement in New York's parks is handled by
police and a 180-member park patrol squad, Ms. Braddick said, ``We
provide a sense of security for people.''
   Besides, rangers show New Yorkers that their backyard is not all
concrete. Last year, 84,000 people attended 2,618 educational
programs held by the rangers.
   ``When you think of Manhattan, the picture of beautiful park land
doesn't come to mind,'' Ms. Braddick said.
   And yet in this city of 8 million people there are 26,000 acres
of parks.
   There are 30 species of ducks, 10 species of owls, 15 types of
hawks and falcons, red foxes, snapping turtles, raccoons, skunks,
and, occasionally, deer from Westchester County to the north. The
areas have about 30 types of endangered plants, including the winged
monkey flower.
   New York's first park, Bowling Green, was created in 1733. The
city set aside land for Central Park in the mid-1850s, created the
Department of Parks in 1870 and during commissioner Robert Moses'
tenure from 1934 to 1960 doubled park acreage.
   There is little left to put aside now. ``The city has filled its
borders,'' said park historian Jonathan Kuhn.
   The end of major park expansion makes the current public land
that much more important, rangers say.
   One place Braddick loves to visit is Pelham Bay Park in the
Bronx, with its salt marsh, mud flats, 13 miles of rocky shoreline
and 520 acres of forest.
   Herman Barrocales, 33, fished in Brooklyn's Prospect Park when he
was a boy. Now he is a park ranger stationed there. One of his jobs
is to lead hawk watches.
   On a crisp morning recently, he passed around binoculars on a
second story terrace in Prospect Park's Boathouse. He told the dozen
people who came by that New York was a choice location to see hawks
as it is on their fly path from Canada to warmer spots.
   In an hour, five birds of prey were sighted, including the rare
peregrine falcon. The falcon took its time in passing. Barrocales,
normally talkative, barely said a word as he watched.
   The children from P.S. 122 who visited Van Cortlandt Park also
were impressed by the wildlife around them.
   After listening to DeSimone's message that they should take care
of the parks _ underscored as he picked up a plastic six-pack holder
and broke its rings, which can strangle ducks _ 11 year-old Lanette
Romero said she had learned a lesson:
   ``You should keep your eyes open, make sure you don't harm
animals and look for clues like footprints.''
   After school, she was going to the library, she said. ``I'm going
to find more out about muskrats.''

   Walt Disney's animated features and G-rated
movies were always a sure thing for parents: They didn't have to
worry about what their children would see.
   But Hal Willner's record of Disney songs should probably carry
the label Parental Guidance Advised.
   Willner has produced ``Stay Awake,'' an album featuring
arrangements of tunes from Disney movies by such musicians and song
stylists as Ringo Starr, James Taylor, Sinead O'Connor, Los Lobos
and Yma Sumac.
   ``Your memories of Disney films are usually very wholesome,''
said Willner. ``You remember the sweetness. But these are very
dramatic movies. `Bambi' has every element: birth, death, happiness,
fear. It's amazing.
   ``These films do show the dark side of life.''
   And just to prove his point, the 32-year-old Willner has given
``Stay Awake'' a generous mix of happy and sad songs. Along with
Aaron Neville's upbeat ``Mickey Mouse March'' and Garth Hudson's
sunny ``Feed the Birds'' (``Mary Poppins'') are Tom Waits' eerie
``Heigh Ho (The Dwarfs Marching Song)'' and a chilling version by
O'Connor of ``Someday My Prince Will Come,'' both from ``Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs.''
   ``I have heard other Disney tributes,'' Willner said, ``but no
one was exploring that other stuff.''
   ``Stay Awake'' is Willner's fourth compilation record. His others
include ``Amarcord Nino Rota,'' which paid tribute to the man who
scored many of Federico Fellini's films; ``That's the Way I Feel
Now,'' a collection of Thelonius Monk songs, and ``Lost in the
Stars,'' the music of Kurt Weill.
   He did not intend to make a series of compilation LPs, but his
inspiration seemed to run in that direction. Attending a concert of
Monk's music at Carnegie Hall, he was so bored by how the great
jazzman's songs were being played he decided to put together a
tribute of his own.
   Willner's decision to make the ``Stay Awake'' record also came
about spontaneously. He had purchased an anthology back in the
mid-1970s, played it for about a week and then put it away.
   But the album remained on his shelf, and when he started thumbing
through his collection in search of another project, ``angel voices
sang,'' he said, as he came upon the Disney record.
   Finding artists wasn't a problem, since he had made broad
contacts through his previous records. The trick was fitting them
together in a coherent album. So opening with Ken Nordine's ``Hi
Diddle Dee Dee'' (``Pinocchio'') and finishing up with Ringo Starr
crooning ``When You Wish Upon a Star'' (``Pinocchio''), Willner
takes his listeners through a bumpy ride on ``The Wonderful World of
Disney.''
   The performers were selected from around the world. From Los
Angeles came Bonnie Raitt, who sings ``Baby Mine'' (``Dumbo'') with
the funk group ``Was (Not Was).''
   ``Don Was' son had the copy of the Dumbo soundtrack,'' Willner
said. ``We sat around his house one night and kicked around the
names of singers we liked a great deal, and Bonnie was one of them.''
   Willner got Van Dyke Parks and Harry Nilsson to visit Starr in
England and persuade the ex-Beatle to sing on the record.
   ``One of the first guys I thought of was Ringo,'' Willner said.
``I remembered `Goodnight' from the (Beatles') `White Album.' It's
not a conventional singing voice, but it works.''
   O'Connor's appearance on ``Stay Awake'' (``Mary Poppins'') came
about when Willner visited Dublin at the end of 1987.
   ``I saw her on television and I went, `Aaaah.' I thought, `Boy,
would that be great if she could do `Prince Will Come.'''
   And to Willner's surprise, O'Connor readily agreed, completing an
acoustic version of the song in one take.
   Back in the United States, he recruited the Minnesota-based rock
group The Replacements, who performed a stomping version of
``Cruella De Ville'' (``101 Dalmatians'').
   ``We got in touch with them. They were on and off the record
three times, but at the last minute, they decided it was a cool
project.''
   In New York, Willner got Suzanne Vega through A&M Records, which
issued ``Stay Awake,'' and met James Taylor at a party.
   ``He got up and sang this old ballad and it was so beautiful. And
I talked to him and told him about the record. I always did like
James Taylor's voice.''
   Taylor sang ``Second Star to the Right'' (``Peter Pan'') and the
list goes on and on: jazz singer Betty Carter covering ``I'm
Wishing'' (``Snow White''); R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, 10,000 Maniac's
Natalie Merchant and the Roches combining on ``Little April Shower''
(``Bambi''); Nilsson singing ``Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah'' (``Song of the
South'').
   ``I had to stop the record sometime,'' Willner said. ``You can't
keep recording forever.''
   But Willner can keep making records. Next might be a tribute to
the late composer, pianist and orchestra leader Duke Ellington. But
fans will have to be patient.
   ``Producing leaves you open to ulcers because you have to get the
best performance possible,'' the producer said. ``I love the final
product, but the process is very hard emotionally. It's an average
of one every two years.''

   Ignore the wheelchair and arthritis.
Her 80 years weigh lightly upon the mind and wit of M.F.K. Fisher,
whose gifts to the world of food and literature are still mounting.
   But shed a tear for the grand dame of gastronomy: Mary Frances
Kennedy Fisher denies herself the pleasure she gives her army of
admirers in the 17 books and scores of magazine pieces that for 50
years set a lean and spicy standard few can match.
   ``I never read anything I've written,'' she snapped. ``I don't
care to go back. I never read a word of print about me or by me.''
   She wouldn't argue with going back to being able to use her hands
for typing. Fate has ruled that she must dictate into a tape
recorder. There's no question of her not doing it. Writing is as
important to her as air.
   ``I am compulsive about it,'' admitted the Michigan-born author,
who wrote such tasty morsels as ``How to Cook a Wolf,'' ``The
Gastronomical Me,'' ``Consider the Oyster'' and her pungent
``Alphabet for Gourmets.''
   Chafing among cushions in her little wine-country house, she
added, ``But it's like pulling teeth. It's just awful. I can't
dictate to a person so I dictate secretly. I don't make many
mistakes, you know. It's my newspaper training. ... I don't have any
errors once I get it down on paper, thank God.''
   In 1937, the world's food writers discovered a tough new kid on
the block when they eyed this paragraph leaping from the pages of
``Serve It Forth,'' Mary Frances' first book:
   ``The quails are an artful lure to the most refined of palates,
and the rabbit stew, steaming, aromatic, is made just as tempting
with an onion or two, pepper freshly ground, a little bacon and a
dash of cheap, pure wine.''
   A somewhat less literate reporter observed, ``It's a shame you
don't get to read your good stuff like that.'' She was not
impressed. Others are. It was once said of her crisp prose:
   ``She writes about food as others do about love, but rather
better. ... Fisher writes not as a specialist but as a whole human
being, spiky with prejudices, charming, short-tempered,
well-traveled and cosmopolitan. ... She is a person, not a gourmet
masked as a writer. Her passion comes from inside her.''
   That was 35 years ago. Except for such indignities as two hip
replacements, a corneal implant and the arthritis, nothing has
changed, and she remembers everything between times _ three
husbands, magazine pieces, the books that ``never made me any
money,'' the travels in Europe.
   Of all her mates, said Mary Frances, ``my real husband was Jimmy
Parrish (Dillwyn Parrish).'' They lived in a stone house surrounded
by a vineyard and garden in Vevey, Switzerland.
   It was there, she said, that she learned from her Italian Swiss
neighbors to cook vegetables in their own juices ``with sweet butter
or thick olive oil to encourage them a little; tomatoes and onions
and sweet peppers and all the summer things.''
   She credits her start in food-writing on an episode during
prohibition when she was living in Whittier, Calif., and her
newspaperman father, Rex Kennedy, was teaching at a nearby college.
She was working in a postcard shop. One afternoon she had a half-day
off and decided to go the public library, where she found an
Elizabethan cookbook on a table.
   ``It smelled so good ... the binding. I started writing,'' she
said.
   She showed her writing to Alfred Fisher, the man who became her
first husband. She had just turned 21 when they married, and 11 days
later they set off to France and three years in Dijon, where he got
his doctorate and she earned a degree at the University of Dijon.
   Back in the states, her writing started making the rounds. At 26,
she sold her first magazine story, ``The Standing and the Waiting,''
and it conjured visions, full of verbs and wide swaths of color. The
most scholarly of her work is her translation of legendary
gastronomer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's ``The Physiology of
Taste,'' her favorite work.
   Smoothing her red polka-dot dress, she peered out the window of
the small, busy house she has lived in for 18 years, craning to see
who was coming to visit her next. They come all day long, for a few
moments in her ``youthful'' presence. They come professionally or as
friends, for interviews, a publisher's conference, a chat, advice or
perhaps to drop off a particularly nice piece of cheese or share a
plateful of the chincoteague oysters she loves so much.
   She calls her visitors ``strays and wayfarers.'' They sit with
her near a large picture window in her Sonoma County house on the
edge of the old Bouverie Ranch, in Jack London country.
   But in her eighth decade, Mary Frances is not overwhelmed with
the way things have gone with the world.
   ``We're suicidal,'' declared the mother of two daughters. ``Our
doom is sealed. I take a very dim view of us as a human race, the
only one that kills itself and everything around it. ... We've
poisoned the earth and the land and the water. What else is there to
poison? ... I don't have any hope for us at all.''
   We looked out on her green meadow, rolling to the trees,
peaceful, and the harsh pronouncement seemed a long way away.

<HEAD>Union Leader Gives Thatcher Competition as Hate Figure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BROMLEY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Other labor leaders shun Eric Hammond and
he rivals Margaret Thatcher as a hate figure for the left, but many
see the maverick union boss as a natural product of the prime
minister's age of enterprise.
   Hammond is the polecat of organized labor, particularly since his
electricians' union was expelled from the national labor federation,
and he appears to enjoy the role.
   His eyes twinkle as he lauds laws that have emasculated the
once-mighty labor movement since Mrs. Thatcher and her Conservative
Party won power in 1979.
   ``I'm only half-joking when I say we'll be erecting statues to
the Tories before the end of the century,'' he said. ``Why? Because
they will have saved the trade union movement from itself.''
   Labor legislation in the Thatcher decade has outlawed sympathy
walkouts, forced secret-ballot membership votes before strikes are
called and empowered employers to sue unions for damages resulting
from illegal strikes.
   A revolution was wrought in British working practices, and
Hammond's 360,000-member Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication
and Plumbing Union joined it.
   In his office at the union's elegant headquarters, a converted
mansion in commuter country 10 miles from London, Hammond continues
the union-baiting that got him banished from the Trades Union
Congress, the 9 million-member British labor federation.
   He is accused of splitting organized labor, making cozy no-strike
deals with employers, invading the territory of other unions and,
through a 1986 deal with publisher Rupert Murdoch to run his
high-technology presses, breaking the power of newspaper production
unions.
   Hammond, 59, is a sharp contrast and constant provocation to
left-wing leaders of old, traditional unions: Arthur Scargill and
his National Union of Mineworkers, for instance, and the huge
Transport and General Workers Union with its 1,250,000 members.
   ``Hard times have been forced upon the unions and the way Eric
Hammond has tried to solve this is through sweetheart deals with
employers,'' said Andrew Murray, an official of the transport union.
   ``A strike is always a weapon of last resort. The question is
whether union officials have the right to surrender that resort.''
   In September, the Trades Union Congress expelled Hammond's
electricians for refusing to abandon single-union, no-strike deals
with a Japanese electronics company in Wales and a British food
chain.
   Hammond, unrepentant, delivered his credo in a final speech to
the federation's annual conference and walked out before the
expulsion vote was taken.
   ``Our members,'' he thundered, ``reveal an enthusiasm for the
market system and its values and infuriate the sherry-party
revolutionaries with their model resolutions and conference-hall
rhetoric.''
   He is negotiating a merger with the Amalgamated Engineering
Union, which has 800,000 members and is the nation's second largest
after the transport workers.
   If that goes through next year, the Trades Union Congress must
either take the electricians back in their new form or risk the
emergence of a rival federation of the highest-skilled workers.
   Although Hammond is isolated, at least for now, he sees himself
as the smart kid on the block, the adapter to modern realities in a
bleak time for organized labor.
   Membership in unions belonging to the Trades Union Congress has
declined from nearly 13 million to under 9 million since 1979.
Nearly 50 percent of British workers belonged to unions then, but
only 35 percent do now.
   Hammond's background is impeccably working class. He is the son
of a paper-mill timekeeper, grew up in a modest home at Gravesend,
20 miles east of London, and became an apprentice electrician at 16.
   He began as a leftist, he said, but moved right.
   Communists took over the union but were kicked out in a 1962
ballot-rigging scandal and the right has controlled it since. Frank
Chapple, Hammond's Cockney predecessor, was the scourge of the left
in the socialist Labor Party, which unions founded and finance.
   Chapple, now a life peer sitting in the non-elected House of
Lords, warned his many enemies in the Tredes Union Congress when he
retired four years ago: ``You think I'm right-wing? Wait till you
see Eric.''
   Experience bore him out.
   Hammond has excoriated the London Labor Party for, as he put it,
consorting with ``terrorists, lesbians and other queer folk.''
   He has pushed single-union deals, with or without no-strike
clauses that stipulate binding arbritration.
   Unions have made more than 30 such arrangements, mainly with
Japanese electronic companies _ often after several unions vie to
offer managers the most attractive package.
   Hammond's alliance with Murdoch revolutionized the newspaper
industry in less than two years. When Murdoch fired 5,000 production
workers in January 1986 for striking against new high-tech
machinery, Hammond and his electricians moved in to run the presses.
   With the production unions vanquished, the rest of the national
newspaper industry quickly followed suit.
   ``The other unions were demanding jobs for life ... and Murdoch
said, `Get lost','' Hammond said in the interview. ``I don't see how
we could have acted any differently.''
   ``These deals are what our members want, and that's what it's all
about _ membership. We're operating in a tough environment.''

<HEAD>Sharpen the Guillotine, the French Revolution Is Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Milwaukee is rolling out the guillotine, New York is
showing what well-dressed nobility wore to the dungeon in 1789 and
dozens of other American cities are planning hundreds of events to
celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   ``Americans love a party, they love a bicentennial and they love
France. The French Revolution is a natural,'' said Christopher
Henze, cultural attache at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Henze is
keeping track of more than 300 concerts, exhibits, symposiums,
festivals, film series and TV shows taking place across the United
States in 1989.
   Birmingham, Ala., alone has an events list nine pages long that
includes ``Marcel Proust at the University of Alabama'' lectures,
wine tastings, productions of Moliere's ``Tartuffe'' and cooking
classes by a chef from Paris' famed Le Cordon Bleu.
   The French are enthusiastic about the American revolutionary
fervor and have decided to send the original Declaration of the
Rights of Man and Citizen to an exhibit at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington next spring. It will be the first time
France's most precious document has been on display anywhere since
it was locked away in 1791 when it was embodied as the preamble to
the French constitution.
   The Declaration was drafted in 1789 by Emmanuel Sieyes, the
French statesman and clergyman, and mirrored the ideas of the
liberal Enlightenment. It spoke of the equality of men and the
inalienable rights to security, liberty and property.
   The founding document of the French Republic will be flown across
the Atlantic on April 18 on another source of French pride, the
supersonic Concorde, which will be on view for a short while at the
Smithsonian's Aerospace Museum.
   ``That a single small country like France can have itself
represented by a beautiful jet like the Concorde and a document like
the Declaration of the Rights of Man is incredible,'' said Sir
Valentine Abdy, the Smithsonian's representative in Europe. He has
arranged for a Concorde plane to be given to the Smithsonian when it
goes out of service.
   French musicians and Americans of French ancestry will play on
the Washington Mall June 30-July 4, at about the time the
Smithsonian's New York branch, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, is
displaying the best objects from two centuries of French decorative
art and design.
   The $2.5 million cost of the ``L'Art de Vivre'' exhibit is being
paid by the French Comite Colbert, a group of luxury goods companies
such as Krug Champagne and Hermes.
   Cartier jewelry will sparkle in museums in New Orleans, San Diego
and elsewhere. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will show
fashions from ``The Age of Napolean: Costume From Revolution to
Empire.'' Artist Gustave Corbet will be reconsidered at the Brooklyn
Museum in an exhibit that will later travel to Minneapolis. And, for
lovers of the printed word, The New York Public Library will offer
the ``Revolution in Print,'' a collection of books, broadsides,
prints, posters, manuscripts and periodicals, many on loan from the
Bibliotheque Nationale.
   French dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet and other companies
will pirouette across stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts.
Daniel Barenboim will lead the Orchestre de Paris on a seven-city
tour including stops in Chicago and at New York's Carnegie Hall. And
French arias will resound in opera halls in Texas, California and
Washingon, D.C.
   Keyboardist Ray Charles and saxophonist Dexter Gordon will swing
with French jazzmen Claude Bolling and Claude Nougaro at Carnegie
Hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at
Washington's Kennedy Center for the Arts, Chicago's Orchestra Hall
and the Los Angeles' Universal Amphitheatre.
   What does jazz have to do with the French Revolution?
   ``Nothing. But it's a chance to celebrate the role of the French
over several decades in giving black American musicians the right to
work, the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated
audiences,'' said Edward Tuck, who will produce a television show
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived
and worked in Paris. Such artists have have included the late
composers and pianists Thelonius Monk and Bud Powell.
   Tuck, who is also president of the French-American Foundation,
said the number and variety of U.S. celebrations reflect America's
awareness that the French Revolution was the basis not only for the
Declaration of Human Rights adopted Aug. 26, 1789, but also for the
U.S. Bill of Rights, adopted 30 days later.
   ``And that is no coincidence,'' he said. ``Ideas ricocheted
between the great thinkers of our two countries. It is the
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual
is born with.''
   Celebrations will crescendo on Bastille Day, July 14, when 200
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven
prisoners instead. The day marked the beginning of lower-class
participation in the revolution, which had been led by the
bourgeoisie (middle class) against the aristocrats and the clergy.
   In Milwaukee, more than 200,000 people are expected to attend a
four-day festival where food vendors will cook crepes and frog-legs
kabobs to be washed down with champagne, ``or rather American bubbly
white wine, because it's cheaper,'' said Betsy Kohler, who is
coordinating the event.
   There will be a mock Arc de Triomphe constructed as the finish
line for a midnight run, not to mention the ever-popular guillotine.
   ``We had one last year and everyone liked it,'' Kohler said.
``It's the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and
someone else takes their picture. Also, it's very nicely painted and
has the history of the revolution printed on it.
   ``A lot of people are going to learn about the French Revolution
this year.''

   They explored the cosmos and peered into the inner space of
atoms. They built racing cars and football teams and nations. They
wrote tellingly of man's fate, and entertainingly of mankind's
fantasies. They made the world sing and dance and laugh. And then
they departed.
   Here is a look back, month by month, at some who died in 1988:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JANUARY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``PISTOL PETE'' MARAVICH, the floppy-socked, shaggy-haired,
utterly astounding basketball genius, biggest point producer in NCAA
history. He collapsed at age 40, while playing the game he loved.
   TREVOR HOWARD, hard-living, craggy-faced British star of stage
and screen, whose most famous role was in the 1946 film ``Brief
Encounter.'' At age 71.
   GREGORY ``PAPPY'' BOYINGTON, World War II flying ace who shot
down 28 Japanese planes and led the renowned ``Black Sheep''
squadron. At age 75.
   ISIDOR ISAAC RABI, Nobel prize-winning physicist who helped
develop atomic energy during World War II and spent the post-war
years trying to control it. Age 89.

leader, in his later years an international jurist and crusader for
disarmament and human rights, winner of both the Nobel and Lenin
peace prizes. At age 83.
   ANDREI ARTUKOVIC, ``Butcher of the Balkans,'' official of
Yugoslavia's Nazi puppet government in World War II, extradited from
the United States and convicted in Yugoslavia of ordering thousands
of prisoners killed. Died in prison at age 88.

   1950 graduate of UNC who lined up in the same backfield as Charlie
``Choo Choo'' Justice on the Tar Heel football team. ``We don't want
to be second-rate.''
   Rizzo was impressed with the faculty when he took the job in
September 1987. At the same time, he understood why some had left.
   ``With all of the problems of a state university, including the
bureaucracy and underfunding, we have still managed to build a high
quality faculty,'' he said in a recent telephone interview from his
office in Chapel Hill. ``We're in danger of losing them.''
   Rizzo said money was only one reason why talented professors were
leaving the school for other opportunities. That's why he is the
chief proponent of a plan to construct a new home for the business
school at a cost of between $20 million and $30 million.
   ``We've got a major-league faculty with a bush-league facility,''
he said. ``A new building would be practically and symbolically very
important.
   ``Just like a good medical school, a business school can't be
successful without significant clinical activity,'' he said. ``Other
business schools may be too lavish, but if we're going to conduct
programs with the corporate world, we need adequate facilities.''
   Despite those obstacles, the business school recently was ranked
No. 8 in the country in a poll of 3,000 MBAs conducted by
BusinessWeek magazine.
   Rizzo has put his stamp on the school's curriculum, giving it
what he described as a ``global perspective.''
   ``A globalization of the curriculum is not unique to this
business school,'' he said, explaining that any reputable business
school could not ignore the study of international business in the
late 1980s.
   The school also has introduced the International Executive
Series, a program which brings in business leaders from such
countries as Japan and the Soviet Union, as well as prominent
American corporate executives who have worked overseas.
   The first lecture last month was given by Kenichi Ohmae,
management director of McKinsey & Co. of Tokyo. The subject: ``Do
Trade Deficits Really Matter in a Global Economy?''
   Other speakers include V.F. Lishchenko of the Academy of Sciences
of the USSR in Moscow; S. Parker Gilbert, chairman of Morgan Stanley
Group Inc.; Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive Officer James Burke;
IBM Corp. Chairman and CEO John Akers; and John Welch, chairman of
General Electric.
   Rizzo wants to encourage more faculty and stdents from the
business school to work and study abroad, and he wants to bring in
more foreigners to teach and study at the school.
   ``The impact of culture on business is important,'' he said.
``Just learning the language is not enough. We need to develop an
appreciation for the things we don't understand because we lack the
cultural background.''
   For example, he said, the conversation at a business lunch in
some European countries may focus on music or literature, not the
latest leveraged buyout or stock tip.
   ``It's easy to pick up the phone and do business in this country
because we speak the same language,'' Rizzo said. ``Building
relationships in other countries can be difficult. We need people
groping and struggling to do business effectively in the foreign
marketplace.''
   The school's reputation seems to be improving, as evidenced by
its move up in the BusinessWeek rankings from the top 15 last year
to the top 10. In addition, a Washington, D.C., public relations
firm, Peabody Fitzpatrick Communications Inc., is hard at work
promoting the international lecture series among other projects.
   ``To be this good, given all the drawbacks we have, is
remarkable,'' Rizzo said.

   Americans' personal income rose strongly in November and October,
the government reported, but financial markets shrugged off the news.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that personal income fell
a slight 0.2 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $4.18 trillion, following a jump of 1.7 percent in October,
the biggest in a year.
   However, the October figure was distorted by surges in farm
subsidies and auto workers' bonuses, the agency said. Excluding
those factors, personal income rose 0.6 percent in November and 0.8
percent in October, both significantly stronger than the inflation
rate.
   The department also said personal consumption spending, which
includes everything except interest payments on debt, rose 0.6
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.32 trillion last
month after a robust 1.0 percent gain in October.
   The numbers were in line with expectations and had little effect
on financial markets. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average, down 6.61 on Tuesday, slipped another 1.43 points to
2,164.64.
   Bond prices and interest rates were little changed.
   ``It looks like 1988 is going out with a bang,'' said Robert
Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in
reference to the income and spending report.
   But Brusca said the new statistics were likely to displease the
Federal Reserve Board, which has been raising interest rates in an
attempt to slow the economy.
   The Fed's goals are to slow inflation and to cool domestic
consumer demand so manufacturers can produce enough exports to
whittle the U.S. trade deficit.
   With spending rising faster than income in November, the personal
savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _ dipped
to 4.3 percent from 5.2 percent in October. Economists say one way
to curb the trade deficit is to increase Americans' savings.
   Disposable, or after-tax, income declined 0.3 percent in November
following a 1.7 percent gain a month earlier. It was the first
decline since April.
   Wages and salaries, key components of personal income, were up
0.4 percent to a $2.52 trillion annual rate in November following a
large 1.5 percent increase caused by bonuses to auto workers.
Manufacturing salaries edged down 0.5 percent after a 2.2 percent
increase in October.
   The biggest increase in spending last month was for durable
goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years.
The category rose 1.5 percent, followed by a 0.6 percent increase
for non-durable goods and a 0.3 percent rise in spending for
services.

   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark

contract rose 33 cents.
   Wednesday's gains in energy futures were ``tremors and
aftershocks after the earthquake yesterday,'' said Jim Fiedler, an

   He referred to a $1.42 a barrel gain Tuesday in the expiring
January contract for West Texas Intermediate crude. That pushed the
January contract to $17.73 a barrel.
   Analysts said the January advance was due to technical buying by
a trader who was caught short and was forced to buy January
contracts to close out a position. The advance lent support to
trading Wednesday in contracts for subsequent months, they said.
   Peter Beutel, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said reports

   Members of the cartel are hoping the non-OPEC nations will bring

order to boost world crude prices.

<HEAD>Johnson Matthey Rebuffs Suggestions of Impropriety on Platinum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum refining giant Johnson Matthey PLC says
it wasn't improper that it didn't disclose its knowledge of Ford
Motor Co.'s plans to develop platinum-free catalytic converters.
   Last week's announcement by Ford that the converter was being
tested sent platinum futures tumbling in a market that had been made
bullish up to that point by the British refiner's forecasts of
strong platinum demand.
   Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum refiner, on
Wednesday reiterated its bullish forecasts and top company officials
shrugged off suggestions that the company acted improperly in not
disclosing its advance knowledge of the device.
   Johnson Matthey not only supplies Ford with platinum, but also
said it had collaborated on the development of the device.
   Some market analysts believed Johnson Matthey had a moral
obligation to disclose its knowledge of Ford's plan.
   But three officials of the British company, who rushed from
London to New York to give a press briefing, rebuffed suggestions of
impropriety.
   ``We don't believe that's an issue,'' said Kevin Gibbons, general
manager of international marketing for Johnson Matthey.
   Gibbons said the company wants to be a ``responsible supplier''
to its customers.
   Johnson Matthey also sells platinum to General Motors Corp.,
Chrysler Corp., Volkswagen of West Germany, Britain's Jaguar and
other big automakers.
   But one metals analyst said Johnson Matthey's failure to disclose
it knew of the project was ``over the line of what was proper and
moral.''
   Gibbons and the other two officials expressed surprise that the
platinum market reacted so strongly to Ford's sketchy announcement
about the experimental device for controlling auto pollution.
   Platinum for current delivery closed last Thursday at $531.90 a
troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down $70 an ounce
from Wednesday's close. The heavily traded contract for January
delivery dropped the daily limit of $25 during that session. There
is no limit on the spot contract.
   On Wednesday, platinum settled $6.60 to $8.10 higher on the New
York Mercantile Exchange with the spot December contract at $542.40
a troy ounce and the more active contract for delivery in January at
$538.40 a troy ounce.
   Analysts linked Wednesday's rally to buying by bargain hunters
whose confidence was bolstered by Johnson Matthey's statements.
   In a statement, Johnson Matthey called the market's negative
reaction last week ``exaggerated'' and ``inconsistent with the
technical possibilities'' of Ford's new catalyst. The feasibility of
the catalyst for wide use has yet to be proven, the company said.
   Ford has said it plans to test the device on 40,000 to 50,000 new
Ford Thunderbirds and Mercury Cougars sold in California, a state
with the toughest air quality standards in the nation.
   The Johnson Matthey officials reiterated their bullish forecast
for platinum, which first was published Nov. 15 in a 24-page review.
   In that report, the company predicted a supply shortfall for
platinum for the next five years, including a record 465,000-ounce
shortfall this year.
   Platinum is an essential element in automobile pollution-control
systems. The metal, in conjunction with certain other metals, acts
as a catalyst in chemical reactions that convert harmful exhaust
pollutants into harmless carbon dioxide and water. This process
occurs inside metal boxes called catalytic converters that have been
required since 1975 on all cars sold in the United States.
   Johnson Matthey said it expected the use of platinum in catalytic
converters in 1988 to account for nearly 75 percent of platinum
demand in North America and for more than a third of world demand
for the metal.
   The refiner also said new pollution standards in Europe would
contribute to a steady increase in global platinum demand for the
next six years.
   ``Platinum is and will remain overwhelmingly the prime metal for
use in cleaning up automobile exhaust gases,'' the company said in
the statement issued Wednesday.

<HEAD>Last Car Rolls Off Line At Chrysler Kenosha Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SOLOMON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The final car made at the Kenosha auto plant
has rolled off the Chrysler Corp. assembly line, followed by the
layoffs of another 700 Chrysler workers as automaking neared its end
here after 86 years.
   United Auto Workers Local 72 president Ed Steagall said the final
car, a maroon Omni subcompact, rolled out about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday.
   ``There are some who are sad and other people were crying _ and
still others were relieved to know that the stress was ending, the
awaited plant closing was here,'' said Steagall, who spent the
morning with workers in the final assembly division.
   The workers laid off Wednesday were among nearly 4,000 to lose
jobs since Friday, Steagall said. He said only 300 to 500 more
remained in the plant to close down operations and strip equipment
in preparation for Friday's formal closing.
   Chrysler, which bought the plant from the former American Motors
Corp. in 1987, announced in January it would end car production
here, eliminating 5,300 jobs. The company will continue operating a
Kenosha engine plant with about 1,000 employees.
   Those who worked on the final car began emerging from the Gate 6
plant exit at mid-afternoon. Many went straight to gather with
friends at local taverns.
   ``It just got quieter and quieter as the jobs closed down along
the line and people were allowed to leave,'' said Barbara Schneider,
a worker in final assembly and 14-year veteran at the plant. ``By
the time the car was ready it was so quiet it was almost
depressing.''
   She said workers no longer were bitter but were sad about having
to leave their ``expanded family.''
   The impact of the plant closing would be more noticeable as she
and other dislocated workers begin looking for new jobs, she said.
   ``I raised my kids working here and now they've grown up and now
I'm going to be looking for a new job in the same market that my
kids are entering,'' Schneider said. ``I'm going to be competing
against my kids to get a job.''
   Kitty Koski, a 10-year employee, said leaving behind the memories
of working in the same plant that her parents did would be more
difficult than finding a new job.
   ``e solidarity, the friendship and tut you're not going to find
the solidarity, the friendship and the pride that workers have
here,'' she said.
   Her husband, Wayne, a 15-year plant employee, was one of the last
people to work on the final Omni.
   ``We just jacked up the engine, put it in the car and we left,''
he said.
   Chrysler officials did not allow reporters or photographers into
the plant to watch the final cars processed, but Steagall said many
workers brought their own cameras and video cameras to photograph
the work on the last cars.
   Automaking in Kenosha began when Thomas P. Jeffrey Co. built its
one-cylinder Rambler in 1902. The Jeffrey Co. became Nash Motors
Corp. in 1918, then Nash-Kelvinator in 1937 and American Motors in
1954.
   Citing the age and inefficiency of its Kenosha plant, Chrysler
told state officials Jan. 27 that it would shut down the operation.
   State officials threatened to sue Chrysler, saying the No. 3
automaker had promised verbally to keep the plant open through 1992
in exchange for $5 million in state job training money.
   Chrysler later reached an out-of-court settlement taht included
$250 million in aid to workers, the community and the state.

selling floors getting busier every day. And across town at
Bloomingdale's, parts of the first floor look as crowded as an
anthill, spokeswoman Miraed Smith said.
   California retailers also said sales seemed to be growing
steadily.
   ``They are all big days this week, very heavy,'' said Bill
Dombrowski, spokesman for Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., which owns
Broadway, Emporium Capwell, Thalheimers and Weinstock's department
stores in California and the Southwest.
   At Oshman's, a Houston-based sporting goods chain, ``The late
shopping surge seems to be materializing as we expected,'' said
company president Marvin Aronowitz. ``We have had snow in California
and we've had good sales on ski apparel and accessories.''
   The pace was even pushed at elegant Edmund T. Ahee Jewelry Co. in
the wealthy Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe Woods.
   ``These three days, you can't believe how fast people buy,
they're so desperate,'' owner Edmund T. Ahee said.
   Some of the desperation is from the late shoppers who can't find
the items they're looking for. Retailers, forced to take a cautious
stance by nearly two years of sluggish sales, have kept inventories
tight so they would not be saddled with surplus merchandise or
forced to slash prices.
   At Dallas-based Neiman-Marcus, catalog sales have exceeded
expectations and the store has run out of some items, spokeswoman
Pat Zajac said.
   ``As people call in to order we are offering alternatives,'' she
said.
   She said about 15 to 20 items were out of stock, including some
crystal, $25-and-under gifts and apparel.
   At Upton's, a chain of 19 department stores in Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee, ``We're scrounging to get
more inventory in here,'' said Chuck Kremers, director of sales
promotion. ``We hope to have inventory to satisfy everybody that's
coming this weekend.''
   Demand also was outstripping supply for some of the season's
biggest toys. The hottest toy of 1988, the Nintendo video system,
was racking up phenomenal sales but retailers reported that some
Nintendo games _ including Super Mario Brothers II _ were in very
short supply.
   Part of the problem was a shortage of chips at Nintendo, a
Japanese company. But some toys put out by other manufacturers also
are hard to find.
   Angela Bourdon, a spokeswoman for Toys R Us Inc., the nation's
largest toy store chain, said Real Ghostbusters equipment and
figures, based on a Saturday morning cartoon, and Fisher-Price's
Magic Scan Checkout, a pretend supermarket cash register, also have
become scarce.
   ``Ninety percent of the consumers who are last-minute (shoppers)
are not getting the items,'' she said.
   Toys R Us has gotten new shipments of the toys, but ``there they
are _ and they're gone,'' Ms. Bourdon said.
   The retailers were expecting that Saturday, Christmas Eve, would
be the biggest day of their year.
   Because consumers won't be working, ``that'll be a very busy
day,'' said Dombrowski of Carter Hawley Hale.
   ``We're anticipating that Saturday will be very, very heavy,''
agreed Ms. Zajac of Neiman-Marcus. ``No more looking around. The
browsers will be buyers.''
   Storeowners generally are reporting that holiday sales have
improved modestly from last year's disappointing results. The
Christmas season is the biggest of the year for retailers and is
closely watched by economists as an indicator of consumer demand,
which consititutes about two-thirds of all economic activity.
   Retailers whose Christmas performance has been lackluster are
hoping the last few days will make a difference.
   One of those retailers is Scarbroughs department stores, with
three branches in Austin, Texas. Company president Scott Glass said
Wednesday, ``The good news is that things today seem to be coming to
life.'
   ``We just hope that can carry over through the week,'' he said.

<HEAD>Takeover Investor Indicted for Securities Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Takeover speculator Paul A. Bilzerian claims his
federal indictment on charges stemming from the government's
sweeping investigation of Wall Street corruption is the result of
overzealous prosecution.
   Bilzerian, who acquired the defense contractor Singer Co. earlier
this year following a hostile battle, has been indicted on federal
charges of lying to the government and illegally hiding stock in
connection with four multimillion-dollar transactions in 1985 and
1986.
   The 12-count indictment announced Wednesday against the
38-year-old St. Petersburg, Fla. resident was the latest outgrowth
of investigations indirectly linked to the Ivan Boesky insider
trading scandal.
   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani revealed the indictment
hours before he announced a tentative settlement of criminal charges
with the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. that also
stemmed from the Boesky case.
   Giuliani said the probe of Bilzerian's activities was continuing,
but the prosecutor declined to identify anyone else who might be
involved.
   Bilzerian immediately denied wrongdoing in a statement issued
through his lawyer Arthur Mathews, and blamed the indictment on what
he called prosecutors seizing on the growing public concern about
corporate takeovers.
   ``I believe this indictment is the price I am paying for having
become publicly identified with takeovers _ a business activity
concerning which the prosecutors in New York appear to have lost all
perspective,'' he said.
   A one-time real estate investor who has made runs on several big
companies, Bilzerian took control of Singer in February after a
$1.06 billion takeover struggle. He has since been busy selling
pieces of Singer, which is based in Stamford, Conn.
   Singer was not among the transactions mentioned in the
indictment, which concerned Bilzerian's attempted takeover of
Cluett, Peabody & Co.; alleged ownership of 58,000 shares of H.H.
Robertson Co.; attempted takeover of Hammermill Paper Co. and
alleged ownership of 306,600 shares of Armco Steel.
   In the Cluett transaction, the indictment said Bilzerian lied in
claiming he used $20 million of his own money to finance his
purchase of Cluett stock, ``when in fact he primarily used money
that he had raised from a small group of wealthy businessmen.'' He
made a $7 million profit by later selling the stock.
   The indictment further alleged Bilzerian illegally hid ownership
of 58,000 shares of H.H. Robertson by selling it to the Los
Angeles-based brokerage Jefferies & Co., with the understanding that
he would buy it back later.
   This activity, commonly known as ``stock parking,'' can be used
to avoid Securities and Exchange Commission reporting requirements
and acquire stock positions in companies without disclosing them
publicly.
   Stock parking, conspiracy and filing fraudulent statements were
further alleged in Bilzerian's accumulation of stock in Hammermill
Paper and Armco, also done in concert with Jefferies. The indictment
said Bilzerian made a $58 million profit by later selling his
Hammermill stake.
   Each count carries a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 in
fines upon conviction. He is scheduled to be arraigned at federal
court in Manhattan Dec. 29.
   There had been persistent speculation prior to the indictment
that Bilzerian was under investigation for his role in some of these
transactions, based on evidence supplied partly by Boyd L.
Jefferies, founder of the brokerage that bears his name.
   Jefferies has been cooperating with government investigators
since he was implicated in securities fraud by Boesky, the
now-imprisoned speculator who turned state's evidence after paying
the government a record $100 million fine for insider trading two
years ago.
   Jefferies's cooperation also has played a major role in at least
two other securities fraud indictments this year.
   Last July, a Manhattan grand jury indicted GAF Corp., its vice
chairman and two subsidiaries on stock manipulation charges after a
failed attempt to acquire the company. Last month, a federal grand
jury indicted Salim B. Lewis, a well-known takeover speculator, on
stock manipulation charges.

<TEXT>
   Corporate takeover strategist Paul
Bilzerian is a former high-school dropout, a Vietnam veteran, and
little league coach who prefers life in this quiet retirement haven
to that in a frenzied financial center.
   His wife Terri says he's also a driven man, who skips breakfast
and lunch and goes on little sleep.
   One day recently, stubble was thick on his chin because he forgot
his razor a couple of days earlier in Minnesota, where he had left
his family vacationing.
   Bilzerian, who took control of defense contractor Singer Co. last
February after a $1.06 billion takeover fight, was indicted
Wednesday in New York on securities fraud charges. He immediately
blamed the indictment on what he called overzealous prosecutors and
vowed to vindicate himself in court.
   In an era of financial predators and insider trading, Bilzerian
became a big player in the big-money game while staying somewhat
apart from it.
   He's not a flashy, well-coiffed hustler in a slick suit. He has
long, sideburns and a thick mustache. His aversion to suits and ties
has become a trademark.
   While professing that the goal of his takeover battles is to
finally win control of a company _ which he did with Singer _ he has
made a fortune from his string of apparent near-misses.
   Four times in the last two years Bilzerian has tried to purchase
companies, only to lose, either because he was outbid or
out-maneuvered. Yet in losing, Bilzerian has done well for himself
and his investors.
   In failed attempts to buy Cluett, Peabody & Co., Hammermill Paper
Co., Allied Stores Corp. and Pay 'N Pak, Bilzerian has reaped
profits of about $50 million, accounts of those takeover forays show.
   By selling his Pay 'N Pak shares, which he bought in April, he
and a partner reportedly earned about $8 million in profits for
three months' work.
   Bilzerian has always maintained his ambition is to own a company.
   The Worcester, Mass., native has accomplished much in a short
period. He collected a degree from Stanford and an MBA from Harvard.
After a radio-station failure here, he began investing in Florida
shopping centers with the financial help of his father-in-law.
   In 1982, he pulled out of real estate and invested in stocks at
the time the strongest bull market in history was about to get under
way. Then he started his takeover business.
   Among his noteworthy business partners are shopping-center
magnate Edward J. DeBartolo and the New Jersey real-estate barons
William and Earl Mack.
   In line with his ambitions, Bilzerian is building a palatial new
home: a $1-million structure in Tampa's ultra-exclusive Avila
subdivision. It's not expected to be completed for a year or so.
   Bilzerian declines to comment on his next financial move, saying
only: ``We'll continue to seek companies and make a lot of money.''

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s proposed settlement
is the most stunning achievement of an insider-trading probe by the
government that reached the public eye 19 months ago.
   From the start, the government's tactic was to give a break to
each person it caught in return for his help in bringing down others.
   It was May 12, 1986, when the Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Drexel's Dennis Levine with making $12.6 million in profits
from illegal trading on inside information.
   Levine was arrested and agreed to surrender the money, plead
guilty to criminal charges and cooperate with the government.
   From Levine, the government progressed to Ivan Boesky. The stock
speculator agreed on Nov. 14, 1986, to pay a record $100 million
penalty to settle charges of trading on inside information supplied
by Levine in 1985 and 1986.
   Boesky's testimony helped the government extract penalties from a
variety of lesser Wall Street figures. On Feb. 13, 1987, Martin A.
Siegel resigned as a managing director of Drexel and pleaded guilty
to illegal stock trading and tax evasion.
   Along the way, Levine was sentenced to two years in prison and
Boesky to three. Boesky remains incarcerated; Levine got out early.
But attention shifted to Drexel and whether the firm itself _ not
just individual executives _ would be prosecuted.
   On Sept. 7 of this year, the SEC formally accused Drexel of a
range of securities fraud violations in a civil suit that asserted
the firm had conspired with Boesky. The case was stalled by pretrial
arguments over the impartiality of the presiding judge, Milton
Pollack.
   On Wednesday, the other shoe dropped as Drexel agreed to a
proposed settlement in which it would plead guilty to six federal
felony counts and pay a record $650 million fine to settle the
biggest securities fraud case in history. The agreement requires
approval of senior Justice Department officials and the SEC.
   Overshadowed by the Drexel deal was the indictment Wednesday of
Paul A. Bilzerian, a takeover speculator who was accused of lying to
the government and illegally hiding stock. Bilzerian, too, was an
indirect victim of Boesky's disclosures.

   Frederick Harold Joseph fought tenaciously to
spare Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. from criminal charges, and then,
when it appeared the investment firm couldn't avoid them, the chief
executive fought just as hard to fashion a deal that would protect
his company's reputation and bottom line.
   Drexel said Wednesday it would plead guilty to six felony counts
and pay a fine of $650 million to end a two-year investigation of
the company by federal prosecutors. The deal must be approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and senior Justice Department
officials.
   Only Monday, it appeared that Joseph, 51, a 14-year Drexel
veteran, would refuse to give in to the government's demands. He
told Drexel employees via the company's public-address system that a
settlement with the government did not make sense at that point.
   On Wednesday, Joseph told employees the settlement ``makes sense
from a business and human point of view.''
   ``It leaves the firm in a very strong financial position and
allows us to refocus our energies on running the business
successfully,'' he said.
   Joseph, a soft-spoken Boston native and Harvard graduate, joined
Drexel in 1974 after spending seven years with E.F. Hutton & Co. and
four with Shearson Hamill Co.
   He worked his way up to the head of corporate underwriting at
Drexel. It was in that position that he and Michael Milken, who
heads Drexel's junk bond department, led the firm to a near monopoly
in the mushrooming junk bond market.
   Joseph's success catapulted him to the chief executive's job in
1985.
   When stock speculator Ivan Boesky settled insider trading charges
with the federal government two years ago, he implicated Drexel in
his plea agreement. Joseph steadfastly maintained the firm's
innocence and said it would fight any charges.
   He reiterated that position over and over, even after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against
Drexel in September.
   It was only in recent weeks that it became apparent that Drexel's
_ and perhaps Joseph's _ resolve had weakened.
   He likely was influenced by several key Drexel executives who had
been pushing for a settlement on grounds the continuing barrage of
publicity and negative speculation was eroding the firm's ability to
maintain its business.
   Joseph also was likely swayed by the investigation's toll on its
bottom line. In a memo to employees last month, the chairman said
the government's investigation had cost the firm an estimated $1.5
billion in revenue.
   If Drexel had been indicted, that amount would have soared and
the firm might have lost financing from major banks. And it could
have taken years for the charges to be resolved.
   But even with those obstacles, Joseph fought hard, reportedly
letting pass several deadlines set by the government for a
settlement.
   The investigation has cast doubt on Joseph's future with Drexel,
although he reportedly has said he expects to outlast the firm's
problems. Drexel has talked recently to former White House Chief of
Staff Howard Baker about Baker's becoming chairman of the firm.

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in the prosecution of
insider trading cases on Wall Street that led up to Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s record agreement to settle securities fraud charges
Wednesday:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine, a Drexel mergers executive, with making $12.6 million
in profits from illegal trading on inside information. He is
arrested and agrees to surrender the money, plead guilty to criminal
charges and cooperate with the government.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a record
$100 million penalty to settle charges of trading on inside
information supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to
cooperate with investigators.
   Feb. 13, 1987 _ Martin A. Siegel resigns as a managing director
of Drexel and pleads guilty to illegal stock trading and tax
evasion. He agrees to cooperate with the government and surrender $9
million to settle civil charges that he engaged in insider trading
with Boesky.
   Feb. 20 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   March 19 _ Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of the Los Angeles
securities firm Jefferies & Co., agrees to plead guilty to two
securities fraud charges, one of which involves a relationship with
Boesky. Jefferies resigns as chairman of his company and agrees to
stay out of the securities business for five years.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to one criminal charge,
conspiracy to make false statements to the SEC, and is released
without bail as he continues to cooperate with the government's
investigation.
   June 4 _ Kidder, Peabody & Co. agrees to pay $25.29 million to
settle civil charges of insider trading and an improper ``stock
parking'' scheme with Boesky. The U.S. attorney's office says Kidder
will not be prosecuted.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a 3-year prison term, and no
fine.
   March 24 _ Boesky begins serving his sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   May 31 _ The SEC votes to authorize civil charges against Drexel
and its controversial junk bond financier, Michael Milken. The
government's investigation of Drexel stems directly from information
supplied by Boesky.
   July 5 _ Levine is released from a Lewisburg, Pa., federal prison
camp to serve the remainder of his term under limited federal
supervision.
   July 6 _ A federal grand jury indicts GAF Corp., its vice
chairman, James Sherwin, and two subsidiaries on charges they
manipulated the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in 1986 after a
failed attempt to acquire the company. The indictments mark the
first formal charges against a U.S. industrial company that stem
indirectly from the Boesky scandal.
   July 14 _ GAF and Sherwin plead innocent.
   Aug. 4 _ A federal grand jury indicts five partners of the
investment firm Princeton-Newport Partners and a former Drexel
official on charges of racketeering, conspiracy and mail and wire
fraud. The case, which grew out of the Boesky scandal, marks the
first time officials of a securities firm are charged with
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act. All defendants deny any wrongdoing.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC formally accuses Drexel of a range of
securities fraud violations.
   Oct. 20, 1988 _ A federal appeals court stops all proceedings in
the Drexel case and related civil litigation while considering
defense arguments that the presiding judge, Milton Pollack, should
disqualify himself.
   Nov. 3, 1988 _ A federal grand jury indicts Salim B. ``Sandy''
Lewis, a well-known takeover speculator, on charges he manipulated
the stock price of Fireman's Fund Corp. in 1986 to help American
Express Co. sell part of its Fireman's Fund stake for more money.
The indictment is based partly on disclosures by Boyd Jefferies more
than a year earlier. Lewis denies guilt.
   Nov. 16, 1988 _ A federal appeals court rejects Drexel defense
motion to disqualify Judge Pollack.
   Nov. 21, 1988 _ Drexel re-appeals motion to disqualify Pollack.
Civil case remains stalled.
   Nov. 30, 1988 _ Intense secret negotiations are reported between
Drexel attorneys and federal prosecutors in a last-ditch attempt by
the firm to avert an indictment, particularly charges of
racketeering, which carry enormous penalties. U.S. attorney is said
to have Justice Department approval to pursue racketeering case if
he believes it appropriate.
   Dec. 1, 1988 _ Drexel's chief executive Frederick Joseph tells
employees in a memorandum that negotiations wth the U.S. attorney
have reached a ``crucial stage,'' and suggests Drexel may settle by
pleading guilty to lesser charges.
   Dec. 6, 1988 _ Cary Maultasch, a senior Drexel trader accused in
the SEC case and threatened with numerous indictments, turns state's
evidence in a plea-bargain agreement with the government.
   Dec. 7, 1988 _ Princeton Newport Partners liquidates because of
what lawyers for its indicted parters call brutal government misuse
of the racketeering laws to coerce them into cooperating in the
Drexel investigation. Prosecutors decline to comment.
   Dec. 8-20, 1988 _ Speculation persists of an imminent agreement
to settle the charges, as more Drexel employees agree to turn
state's evidence.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a
record $650 million fine, contingent upon approval from the SEC and
senior Justice Department officials.

<TEXT>
   The so-called ``junk bonds'' pioneered by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. are corporate securities that pay a high
interest rate because they carry a higher risk of repayment than do
conventional bonds.
   The bonds are designed to allow companies without a track record
of earnings to borrow money based on whether they have sufficient
cash flow to pay off their debts.
   Junk bonds pay higher interest rates than conventional
``investment grade'' bonds because they are viewed as riskier
investments, often because they are used in transactions that saddle
a company with large amounts of debt. The bigger debt load increases
the risk that a company might default on its debt payments.
   Junk bonds came into prominence during the 1980s as a means of
financing corporate buyouts, especially debt-dependent leveraged
buyouts.
   In the last 10 years, the junk bond market has grown explosively,
from less than $25 billion in bonds issued in 1977 to around $160
billion last year _ or 25 percent of the $650 billion corporate debt
market.
   The average company issuing junk bonds is about 36 years old, has
around $1 billion in assets and employs more than 4,000 people,
according to Drexel's calculations.

   When Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons
the other day that she'd eaten a scrambled egg for lunch, she was
doing much more than making small talk.
   The prime minister was trying to calm a salmonella panic that has
forced a government minister to resign, hurt the poultry industry,
cost taxpayers more than $35 million, and left the public bewildered
about whether Britain's eggs are safe.
   The crisis began Dec. 3 when Edwina Currie, then the junior
health minister, told a television interviewer that ``most of the
egg production in this country, sadly, is now infected with
salmonella.''
   Coming from anyone else, it might have passed unnoticed. But Mrs.
Currie, 42, is no ordinary politician; she is colorful, outspoken
and ambitious, and her words command attention.
   Ever since she brandished handcuffs during a law-and-order debate
at the Conservative Party's 1981 convention, her well-timed
headline-grabbers have made her famous.
   Elected to Parliament in 1983, she became a deputy health
minister in 1986, arriving at work in a T-shirt that said: ``Never
underestimate the power of this woman.''
   Mrs. Thatcher was known to be fond of the woman who had once said
of a defeated election rival: ``I eat people like Peter Kent for
breakfast.''
   Reveling in the role of national nanny, Mrs. Currie crusaded
against smoking and drinking; exhorted pensioners to knit themselves
winter garments; told families to forgo holidays and spend the money
on their teeth; denounced northerners' fondness for junk food; and
advised traveling businessmen to avoid AIDS by taking their wives
along.
   So when she made her salmonella remark, the knives were drawn.
``She should really think before she opens her mouth,''
editorialized the tabloid Sun. Writer Auberon Waugh called her ``a
bossy, garrulous and foolish woman.''
   On Dec. 4, as egg producers said sales were falling rapidly, Mrs.
Thatcher sought to calm the waters by saying she ate scrambled eggs
for lunch. But despite opposition ridicule and the anger of Tory
lawmakers from farming constituencies, the government refused to
give eggs a clean bill of health.
   The gist of official statements was that while Mrs. Currie may
have overstated the problem, it was real. Salmonella, a strain of
food poison that causes severe vomiting, fever and diarrhea, can be
fatal, and 26 people who died this year were carrying
poultry-related salmonella, the Health Department said.
   It launched a $900,000 advertising campaign that said eggs posed
``very little risk'' for the healthy, but that the elderly, sick and
pregnant should cook them thoroughly.
   The ads also said 49 salmonella outbreaks affecting 1,000 people
this year were traced to eggs and that ``this underestimates the
numbers.''
   Furious egg producers said the ad only made things worse. They
said sales were down 60 percent, 400 million unsold eggs had
accumulated, and many of Britain's 39 million egg-laying hens would
have to be slaughtered.
   As newspapers reached for outrageous puns on ruffled feathers and
curried eggs, poultry farmers appeared on TV talking of bankruptcy.
   The egg producers filed a dozen damage suits against Mrs. Currie,
the press ridicule mounted, and on Dec. 16, after meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher, Mrs. Currie resigned.
   But at this point, her image began to shift to that of a
scapegoat brought down by the powerful farming industry and its
friends in government.
   Asked Frank Dobson, an opposition Labor Party lawmaker: ``If she
was right, why did she have to resign? If she was wrong, why was she
not corrected? ... All in all, no one any longer knows what the
truth is.''
   On Monday, when the government announced a $34 million bailout
for the farmers, the Daily Express was one of several newspapers
that denounced the government for paying off the very industry that
had unleashed the disease. ``The egg industry has behaved
appallingly in the hounding of Mrs. Currie,'' it editorialized.
   Even the venerable violin virtuoso Yehudi Menuhin weighed in,
writing to The Times to say Mrs. Currie shared ``the classical fate
of all bearers of bad tidings ... The scapegoat is sacrificed, thus
delaying, diverting and betraying the remedy.''
   Helen Morris of London, whose husband contracted salmonella from
eggs and was sick for 10 weeks, said if the producers sued Mrs.
Currie, she might countersue the producers.
   Many praised Mrs. Currie for using her publicity skills to raise
health consciousness, while former lawmaker Tom Benyon said the
affair would help Britons ``understand better, now they have seen it
in action, the brute power of the lobby.''

   They stand up, they sing, they flicker on and off.
   Ingenuity and high technology have led to some unusual Christmas
cards, which retailers say are a big hit with Japanese holiday
shoppers this year.
   Take, for example, the card that unfolds into an upright
Christmas tree, complete with blinking red lights and a two-tune
repertoire of ``Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer'' and ``Santa Claus
Is Coming to Town.''
   ``It's very big with 18- to 25-year-old women this year,'' said
Takehiro Ushishima of the sales promotion department at Tokyu Hands,
a popular store for hobby goods.
   The songs are stored in a tiny integrated circuit that is
activated by a light sensor when the card is opened. The cost is
about $15.
   Tokyu Hands has already sold out of cards made with real gold
costing upwards of $3.
   ``The most popular new cards this year are those that come with
compact discs,'' Ushishima said. The discs feature one or two
Christmas tunes and are often decorated to match the cards they are
sold with.
   High-tech cards are decidedly upscale, averaging over $8 each, or
more than four times the price of the conventional printed card.
   ``But this year card makers in general have been more
elaborate,'' bringing up the average price, Ushishima said.
   Christians are a 1 percent minority in Japan, where Buddhism and
the indigenous Shinto faiths are most common, and Christmas is not a
national holiday. However, many Japanese non-Christians celebrate
Christmas by having parties, exchanging gifts or eating special
foods.
   ``Sales of Christmas cards are now at their peak,'' said Ichiro
Saito, public relations director of Itoya, a major stationery store
in the swank Ginza district.
   ``It's been a good year for Christmas cards because of the
emperor's illness,'' Saito said.
   Emperor Hirohito, 87, has been seriously ill since Sept. 19,
causing a mood of self-restraint in the public, including a slump in
the sale of New Year's greeting cards.
   It appears that Christmas cards are more popular because their
neutral message of ``Season's Greetings'' is more appropriate than
``Happy New Year,'' Saito said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, the man at the center of the
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trading scandal, built the modern market
in ``junk bonds,'' the favored financing tool of ambitious
entrepreneurs and corporate raiders.
   The Milken-controlled network of investors who buy and sell the
high-yield, high-risk bonds is so pervasive that Drexel reportedly
has been pressed to re-work terms of its settlement to protect its
prime trader.
   Drexel agreed Wednesday to plead guilty to six felony counts and
pay a record $650 million fine to settle a criminal case filed by
the U.S. attorney's office in New York. The deal requires approval
by the Securities and Exchange Commission and senior Justice
Department officials.
   Milken wasn't involved in the tentative settlement, but is named
in a parallel civil case filed by the SEC against Drexel.
   A New York public relations firm Milken hired to represent him
issued a statement saying: ``There is no change in his position, and
his attorneys are continuing to prepare to defend him against any
charges that might be brought.''
   Milken, a boyish evangelist of free enterprise, is credited with
broadening the market for junk bonds, once spurned by many
investors. Under Milken's leadership, Drexel transformed the
securities into a handy tool for corporate raiders and small
businesses to raise cash, either to buy companies or to expand those
that weren't big enough to swing big bank loans or attract
conservative bond investors.
   Milken became central to the junk bond market's operation,
presiding over a network of investors from an office he persuaded
Drexel to set up in Beverly Hills.
   Though many other firms now deal in the bonds, Drexel remains a
leader, and Milken a prime mover. When it comes time for a junk bond
issue, Milken can line up buyers from among those who have
previously benefited by selling their own junk bonds.
   Milken works long hours and lives unobtrusively in a home in
suburban Encino that once was owned by Clark Gable. He is rarely
available for media interviews, and only on his own terms.
   Said to be a devoted family man, he also is a philanthropist on a
grand scale. He has contributed nearly $263 million to three
endowments over the last six years. Those organizations, Capital
Fund Foundation, the Milken Family Foundation and the M&L Milken
Foundation, have paid out $17 million to more than 200 charities and
community groups.
   But that part of Milken's life, too, has come under the cloud of
the Wall Street scandal.
   Capital Fund is named in the SEC's civil complaint against Drexel
as one of the organizations that took part in illegal trades.
   After a Los Angeles Times story detailed the foundation's
activities, the California attorney general's office began a probe.
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., demanded last month that the Internal
Revenue Service investigate to see if the organization had violated
rules for tax-exempt charitable trusts.
   The state audit will focus on possible self-dealing by officers
of the foundations, said Assistant Attorney General Carole Ritts
Kornblum.
   Capital Fund Foundation spokesman Lance Morgan has denied any
wrondgoing by the foundation.
   A Los Angeles businessman who has dealt with Milken's charities
described them as well-run ventures that have supported innovative
projects to improve public and private education, among other
causes. Richard Riordan, an attorney and philanthropist, disputed
critics of Milken's charity work.
   ``Here the guy gave away $263 million,'' Riordan said Wednesday.
``The guy could have bought a yacht bigger than (financier Donald)
Trump's and more planes than (Adnan) Kashoggi's.''
   ``He gives money in a brilliant way; he doesn't just throw it
around,'' Riordan said. ``He has a good staff and they rifle in on
what's needed.''

<HEAD>Japanese Banks Undecided on Joining in RJR Nabisco Financing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Following meetings with corporate takeover
specialist Henry Kravis, Japanese banking officials said Thursday
they remained undecided about their role in his firm's record $24.53
billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Kravis, a partner in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., met Wednesday
and Thursday with more than a dozen leading Japanese banks to urge
them to participate in financing the purchase.
   Japanese banks are expected to provide a significant portion of
the $14 billion in bank financing needed for the RJR takeover.
   Representatives of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., one of KKR's main
financial brokers, also met Wednesday in Tokyo with about 250
Japanese bankers and institutional investors to pitch the sale of
$3.5 billion in high-yield, high-risk ``junk bonds'' that will help
finance the purchase, company officials said.
   Officials at leading Japanese banks said they were not given
enough information about the buyout plan to decide on participation,
which a Sanwa Bank official said ``would require a careful weighing
of the high risks against the high profits.''
   ``We're still deciding whether to become involved,'' said a
official at Mitsubishi Bank, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The meetings (with Kravis and Drexel) were just a
general presentation of the purchase, not a request for a specific
amount of funds.''
   An official at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the world's largest bank,
said it had not received a detailed analysis of the transaction or
of plans to sell off certain RJR assets, a common way to finance
corporate takeovers.
   ``We're very interested, but aren't able to make a decision
without the full materials,'' he said.
   Some newspapers have speculated that KKR will attempt to sell off
some portions of Nabisco, a food producer, to Japanese firms.
   Kravis said in an interview with the nationally circulated
newspaper Asahi Shimbun that Japanese banks responded ``very
positively'' to his contacts, but that he still was unsure how much
they would provide. He said he was considering approaching other
Japanese banks early next year in a bid to increase the number of
participants.
   Asked about estimates that he hopes to raise as much as one-third
of the total bank loan in Japan, or about $5 billion, Kravis said
KKR had not decided on a division of financing.
   In recent weeks, Japanese newspapers have reported that the
Finance Ministry was frowning on Japanese participation in the
buyout plan because of potential risks and concern that such
leveraged buyouts might spread to Japan, where they remain very rare.
   A senior ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Thursday the ministry had ``concern'' about the issue, but
``the decision whether to participate is up to each bank.''
   Bank officials said they had not received any direct
communication from the ministry regarding participation.
   In a leveraged buyout, a purchaser uses a portion of the assets
and future earnings of a company to pay for its purchase. Junk
bonds, which are issued by companies whose credit ratings are below
normal investment grade, often are used to help finance such a
transaction.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, due mainly to
profit-taking following strong rallies Wednesday in the corn and
soybean markets.
   Soybean futures opened slightly higher, contrary to expectations,
on technically inspired, speculative buying. But those gains were
quickly trimmed.
   The soybean complex also was pressured by the Agriculture
Department's announcement late Wednesday that the Soviet Union had
canceled a purchase of 102,500 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal,
analysts said.
   Wheat futures were expected to open higher on the USDA's
announcement that it had targeted Morocco for sales of 1 million
metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices.
   But with several wheat contracts trading at lifetime highs, ``the
wheat market is probably keeping its powder dry and looking to the
outside mkts, with people tending to be cautious,'' said Arthur
Parrish, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   ``You've got a fair amount of profit-taking at these levels,'' he
said.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent to 2} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.36 a bushel; corn was unchanged
to 2 cents lower with March at $2.83{ a bushel; oats were { cent
lower to } cent higher with March at $2.32 a bushel; soybeans were \
cent to 2 cents lower with January at $7.93{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange with frozen pork-belly prices down
sharply in reaction to Wednesday's USDA monthly cold-storage report
showing supplies of frozen bellies as of Nov. 30 at a record-high
level for that date.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .25 cent lower with February at
73.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .42 cent lower
with January at 83.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .35
cent lower with February at 46.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .65 cent to 1.05 cents lower with February at 44.25 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Wednesday while pork futures
were mixed.

   After asserting innocence for more than two
years, Wall Street powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has
reversed itself by agreeing to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million fine to settle the biggest securities fraud
case in history.
   The plea bargain announced Wednesday by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.
Giuliani is the most stunning break in a criminal probe of the
nation's fifth-largest investment firm, which bankrolled some of the
biggest corporate takeovers of the decade through its pioneering use
of high-yield ``junk bond'' securities.
   The probe already has cost Drexel nearly $2 billion in lost
business and legal expenses, sapped morale of its 10,000 employees
and seriously undermined what many consider Wall Street's most
aggressive and able financier.
   Sources familiar with Drexel's decision, who spoke on condition
they not be identified, said its board of directors agonized
Wednesday afternoon before approving the settlement, which would
brand Drexel as a felon but spare it a potentially ruinous,
drawn-out trial.
   Other sources said the agreement also increased the chances that
former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, whose Tennessee law
partnership has been hired by Drexel as a corporate governance
consultant, would join the firm, most likely as chairman. Baker was
in New York on Tuesday and met with Drexel officials during
deliberations on the case.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Baker, a
former White House chief of staff, was not interested in assuming a
major role at the firm if it meant presiding over a lengthy trial.
   The settlement would mark a complete turnaround in Drexel's
claims of innocence. It also does not protect Michael Milken,
Drexel's senior high-yield bond executive and another key target of
the criminal probe. Milken has asserted he's done nothing wrong.
   The deal with Giuliani still requires approval by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and senior Justice Department officials.
   By admitting guilt in the settlement, Drexel exposes itself to
numerous lawsuits by investors who claim they were victimized by the
firm's admittedly illegal acts.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on how the
board voted or its specific reasons, but said directors had
``concluded that this settlement is in the best interest of our firm
and our employees.''
   Milken's public relations agent, the New York firm Robinson,
Lake, Lerer & Montgomery, said in a statement: ``There is no change
in his position, and his attorneys are continuing to prepare to
defend him against any charges that might be brought.''
   SEC enforcement director Gary Lynch did not return telephone
calls for comment about the agreement between Drexel and Giuliani.
   The agreement is the high-water mark in a federal crackdown on
securities fraud that resulted in the arrest two years ago of Ivan
Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's evidence
and was a key source of information in the case against Drexel.
   The $650 million fine _ more than four times as large as the
SEC's annual budget _ is by far the biggest penalty ever assessed
for securities fraud. It easily surpasses the previous record of
$100 million levied against Boesky in November 1986.
   The settlement also marks a major victory for Giuliani, who had
been pressuring the firm for weeks to settle the case or face a much
broader and potentially crippling racketeering and fraud indictment.
   ``There are contingencies,'' Giuliani told reporters at a hastily
called news conference. ``Everybody is proceeding in good faith, I
hope.''
   Giuliani said the felonies cover mail, wire and securities fraud
violations but would not be more specific. He also declined to
elaborate on the components of the $650 million fine, except to say
it would cover criminal fines, civil penalties and future damage
claims against the investment firm.
   Asked why he chose to press for a settlement instead of proceed
with an indictment, Giuliani said ``when a corporation is involved,
the best result you can get after any trial is a financial result
... There's no point of prolonging this, getting involved in
criminal litigation to get a result that would not be any better
than this.''
   Several key Drexel executives themselves had been pushing for a
settlement, saying the continuing barrage of publicity and negative
speculation was eroding the firm's ability to maintain its business.
   Anreder alluded to the internal pressure for a settlement in his
statement, saying: ``For the past two years, our employees have
endured extraordinary hardship and this unprecedented and complex
case might have taken several more years to resolve.''
   He also said: ``After the settlement, we will continue to have
one of the strongest financial positions of any firm in our
industry. The settlement will allow us to concentrate all our
energies, once again, on serving our clients and building our
business.''
   The U.S. attorney's probe of Drexel closely resembled the
investigation by the SEC, which filed a wide-ranging civil suit
against Drexel, Milken and three other key employees three months
ago. The suit, which has been stalled in federal court, accuses them
of conspiring with Boesky to commit a litany of frauds ranging from
insider trading to phony record-keeping.

<HEAD>EEC Proposes To Harmonize Takeover Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission on Thursday proposed
legislation to harmonize the widely differing rules on corporate
takeovers in the 12 European Economic Community nations.
   Under the legislation, a company offering to buy more than a
third of another firm's shares must offer to buy all shares.
   Also, a company initiating a takeover would have to state its
intentions about a target company's future activities, the fate of
its work force and indebtedness.
   The requirement on indebtedness would be important in cases
involving a leveraged buyout in which the purchase is financed by
the future debt of the target company.
   The proposed legislation would also forbid company management
from carrying out ``exceptional operations'' or share sales to block
a takeover without the permission of their shareholders.
   The legislation was proposed after months of intense debate on
the issue at the EEC head office. It now goes to the 12 EEC member
states which may amend the proposed legislation.
   One commission expert said the proposed legislation reflected a
``golden mean'' between the extensive takeover legislation in force
in some EEC nations and the lack of major guidelines in others.
   Britain has the EEC's most developed takeover rules whereas
corporate takeovers _ and legislation governing these _ are
virtually non-existent in Denmark and Greece.
   The approach to takeover legislation varies considerably from one
EEC nation to the next.
   France, Spain and Portugal have a great deal of binding
legislation while many guidelines in Britain, West Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands and Ireland are voluntary codes. The law in Belgium
and Luxembourg is largely the product of accumulated precedents.
   The commission's proposed uniform takeover regulations are part
of its bid to create a single-market EEC as of Dec. 31, 1992.
   It said unfiform guidelines are important as the number of
takeovers is likely to rise in advance of 1992 and cross-border
corporate relationships develop and intensify.
   Another commission proposal on merger and takeover policy, which
was discussed by EEC trade ministers on Wednesday, is a separate
move to prevent such actions from harming industrial competition.

<HEAD>Employees Told to Take Five Days Off Without Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp., facing a break-even
year in 1988, says it told its 27,000 U.S. employees they must take
five days off without pay in the first quarter of 1989.
   ``That equates to a 7.8 percent pay cut in the first quarter, or
about 2 percent for the year,'' Frank Ryan, a spokesman for the
computer company, said Wednesday. ``Executives will take an
additional 5 percent pay cut over the first six months of 1989,'' he
said.
   In addition, merit pay raises have been delayed three months and
the company has canceled for the first six months of 1989 its policy
of matching a portion of employee contributions to a company pre-tax
savings plan. The company had matched 25 percent of the first 2
percent of an employee's cash compensation, Ryan said. The company
won't say how much money these measures will save, he said.
   In a letter to employees notifying them of the cutbacks, Control
Data Chairman Robert Price said they were ``necessary to regain our
momentum by showing a profit in each quarter of 1989,'' Ryan said.
If Control Data's financial position improves by the third quarter
of 1989, employees will be repaid with as many as five extra paid
days off, Ryan said.
   The company's 7,000 employees in other countries will not be
affected by the cutbacks.
   ``Countries around the world have a variety of labor relations
laws that make it difficult to implement this,'' Ryan said.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade in light, thin trading as players evened
up their positions ahead of the long Christmas weekend.
   Most U.S. futures markets, including the Chicago grain markets,
will close at noon local time on Friday and reopen the following
Tuesday.
   ``With the fact that we're heading up against a big holiday
weekend, people wanted to even up a bit and they tended to be
hesitant to do anything major,'' said Arthur Parrish, a grain market
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   He said many traders were looking ahead to the Agriculture
Department's Jan. 13 supply-demand report, which will contain the
government's first official projection for the 1989 U.S. winter
wheat crop.
   ``That will give us an early indication about the general tone of
what the supply response will be to this year's higher prices,''
Parrish said.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.39 a bushel; corn was 1\ cents

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC said Thursday its
BPCC unit, a British printing business, would be sold to a
management group, as expected, for the equivalent of $479 million.
   Maxwell Communication Chairman Robert Maxwell said last month he
intended to sell BPCC, as well as other parts of his printing and
publishing empire, following his succesful $2.5 billion takeover of
Macmillan Inc., the New York-based publisher.
   Maxwell, who also recently bought Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s
Official Airlines Guide for $750 million, is selling assets to
reduce debt and focus his company's interests on publishing.
   The sale of BPCC to Bucksmere Ltd., a company formed from the
management of the printing group and a syndicate of institutional
investors, was widely anticipated. The sale is conditional on
approval from Maxwell Communication's sharholders.
   Under the agreeement, Maxwell Communication will retain certain
BPCC properties and it also will take a minority stake in the
company doing the buyout.

<HEAD>Employees Tell Shamrock No Thanks On Takeover Bid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 Polaroid Corp. employees
have signed a petition that sends a clear message to hostile suitor
Shamrock Holdings Inc. and its president, Stanley P. Gold: Thanks,
but no thanks.
   The petition, which includes signatures from about 60 percent of
Polaroid's worldwide work force, also was designed as a protest
message that corporate takeovers are potentially damaging to
employees.
   ``We don't believe his takeover of Polaroid is in our best
interests,'' Richard Duffy, a 30-year Polaroid employee and member
of the steering committee for the petition drive, said Thursday.
   The petition, circulated at Polaroid headquarters here and in
plans around the world in the last 10 days, says Shamrock ``has no
experience in managing a high-tech company and has not yet explained
to Polaroid employees the method of paying the astronomical debt
needed to acquire'' the company.
   It also says Polaroid workers have ``no comfort or confidence''
that the acquisition would benefit the company, its shareholders or
the community.
   Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based television and radio concern
wholly owned by the Roy E. Disney family, has offered $42 a share in
a bid that values the instant camera pioneer at about $2.6 billion.
Polaroid has called the bid too low and asked stockholders to reject
it.
   The takeover hinges on the pending outcome of a trial in Delaware
Chancery Court, where Shamrock is seeking to have Polaroid's
10-million-share, $300-million employee stock ownership plan
overturned. Shamrock claims it was enacted to forestall a takeover.
   The plan would all but block a takeover because it puts 14
percent of Polaroid stock in the hands of employees. Under Delaware
takeover law, a hostile bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of
a target's outstanding shares for control. Polaroid is incorporated
in Delaware.
   The employee petition opposing the takeover has no bearing on the
court case.
   The petition was the idea of employees who want to form an
independent group of supervisors and hourly workers at Polaroid
plants in eastern Massachusetts and around the country.
   The petition was signed by salaried and non-salaried workers. It
represents a clear majority of Polaroid's 8,300 employees.
   ``It focuses specifically on employee rights,'' Duffy said. ``Our
belief is what is happening to employees in the takeover arena is an
afterthought if a thought at all.''
   ``To some extent we felt we were sitting on the sidelines,
observing and hearing what's going on. It was disempowering,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Government prosecutors have humbled Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., but by deciding to settle with the junk-bond
kingpin without a trial they missed the opportunity to clarify just
which kind of dealings are legal and which are illegal.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani took a pragmatic approach in the
case against Drexel: He got the fifth-largest firm on Wall Street to
agree to fork over $650 million in fines and restitution, plead
guilty to six felony counts and cooperate with government
investigators.
   Worst of all for Drexel, the settlement could result in the early
departure of its most valuable employee, junk-bond wizard Michael
Milken, who now could be indicted and face trial by himself.
   But by settling, Giuliani gave up the chance to clear up two
muddy but critical questions about insider trading:
   _How many people must know a valuable piece of information before
it can be considered public knowledge, so that people can trade on
it legally?
   _How definite must a deal be before public disclosure of inside
information is required?
   Because such questions remain open, the line that separates the
illegal from the well-connected is a blurry one.
   ``I think it's really too bad that we didn't get a trial on these
issues, both to find whether Drexel really did what it was charged
with doing and whether those things were illegal,'' said Alan
Bromberg, a securities law expert who teaches at Southern Methodist
University.
   Exactly how pragmatic Giuliani was will not be known until the
six counts are made public. There has been some speculation that
Giuliani, in a compromise, agreed not to indict Drexel on some
serious insider-trading charges in exchange for getting Drexel to
agree to a big fine and to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.
   If it turns out that the charges are only for technical
violations such as ``parking'' stocks in accounts to conceal their
true ownership, it would be harder for aggrieved stockholders to
ride the government's coattails to recover damages.
   Also, such limited charges would send the wrong message to others
on Wall Street who are contemplating insider trading: ``Namely, that
if you're clever enough and sufficiently well-defended you can plead
guilty to one of these more technical violations without admitting
to serious fraud,'' Bromberg said.
   Still, there is no question that the proposed settlement
announced Wednesday was a blow to Drexel, and the $650 million was
not the worst of it.
   In spite of all the assertions that personalities don't matter,
Milken means more to Drexel than Michael Jordan does to the Chicago
Bulls.
   If Milken leaves his X-shaped trading desk in Beverly Hills,
Calif., Drexel could lose its pre-eminence in the business of
raising money through the issue of high-yielding, high-risk junk
bonds.
   Drexel requires that employees take a leave of absence if
indicted. Milken has indicated that if he is indicted, he would quit.
   Drexel's junk-bond business will not die but it could slowly
wither, particularly if a large part of Milken's staff left with him.
   It is sometimes not clear where the loyalties of Drexel's clients
lie.
   Harold Simmons, a Dallas billionaire takeover specialist who has
used Drexel in three junk-bond financings, predicted Thursday that
Milken will beat any charges against him and stay with Drexel. But
he has also said that he would follow Milken if he set up his own
firm.
   ``I think Mike Milken is one of the nicest guys I've ever met,''
Simmons said.
   William Farley, whose Farley Industries is counting on Drexel for
help in its pursuit of Westpoint-Pepperell Inc., indicated he has
made contingency plans in case Milken's departure makes it
impossible for Drexel to do its job _ something he said he considers
highly unlikely.
   Drexel is likely to make out better than E.F. Hutton & Co. Inc.
but worse than Kidder, Peabody & Co., to name two other firms that
have been caught up in Wall Street scandals this decade.
   Hutton was caught in 1985 kiting checks; that is, circulating
money between banks so it earned more interest than it deserved. The
scandal hurt Hutton's credibility, especially with banks and
municipalities; it also made it hyper-sensitive to impropriety,
which hampered its dealmaking ability.
   Already hobbled, Hutton was crippled by the stock market crash of
1987 and driven into the arms of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.,
which acquired it late last year.
   Kidder, in contrast, survived allegations of insider trading
against several top officials. It agreed in June 1987 to pay $25
million to settle civil charges of insider trading and an improper
``stock parking'' scheme with Boesky. It escaped any criminal
charges and has suffered no lasting damage.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Thursday in extremely light trading. Gold prices also edged higher.
   Business was so light that many banks stopped dealing directly
with each other and instead did deals through international brokers,
who match buyers and sellers, said Jerry Egan, senior trader of the
Bank of Boston.
   ``They took the sails down and put the motor on. The market has
been becalmed,'' Egan said.
   The market showed little reaction to the Commerce Department
report that orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods, excluding the
volatile defense category, shot up 1.8 percent in November, the best
showing since August.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In London, it cost
$1.7990 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8065 Wednesday. In New
York, it cost $1.7988, cheaper than $1.8065 Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.40 yen to a closing 124.62 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 124.65 yen. In New York, the dollar rose to
124.68 yen from 124.55 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7729 West German marks, up from
1.7690; 1.4950 Swiss francs, up from 1.4945; 6.0510 French francs,
up from 6.0390; 1.306.25 Italian lire, up from 1,300.50; and 1.1963
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1986.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
prices, included: 1.7735 West German marks, up from 1.7720; 1.4970
Swiss francs, down from 1.4980; 6.0540 French francs, up from
6.0500; 2.0035 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9920; 1,306.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,302.00; and 1.1959 Canadian dollars, down from

<HEAD>Profit-Taking Snaps Coffee Market's Streak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices fell sharply Thursday on New York's Coffee,
Sugar & Cocoa Exchange, ending a six-day rally amid pre-holiday
profit-taking on signs that a Brazilian dockworkers' strike was
nearing an end.
   On other exchanges, precious metals futures continued to rise,
grains and soybeans were mixed; livestock and meat futures were
mixed; energy futures rose; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Trading activity on most markets was light, with many independent
traders starting the Christmas weekend early. Most U.S. futures
markets will close at noon local time on Friday and reopen Tuesday
morning.
   Futures prices for green, unroasted coffee settled 5 cents to
6.55 cents lower with the contract for delivery in March at $1.4939
a pound.
   Exchange officials halted trading in coffee futures for 55
minutes shortly after a chaotic opening in which the market was
swamped with sell orders linked to reports that some dockworkers had
returned to their jobs in the Brazilian port of Santos, the busiest
coffee port in the world's largest coffee-producing country.
   The strike, which began Dec. 13, has been a key factor in
coffee's dramatic price surge from less than $1.25 a pound on Dec. 1
to the two-year high of $1.59 a pound recorded Wednesday.
   Other fundamental factors underpinning coffee's gains include
tight U.S. warehouse stocks, delayed shipments from Central America,
a rain-slowed harvest in Colombia and a drought in the prime growing
areas of Brazil.
   These bullish developments have been playing out against a
backdrop of rising demand; coffee consumption peaks each year during
the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.
   ``Today we reacted strongly to expectations that the port strike
in Brazil is close to a resolution,'' said Arthur Stevenson, a
coffee analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``Also,'' he said, ``the market has had almost a vertical advance
over the last two weeks and you don't need a Harvard Ph.D. to
realize it was time for a correction.''
   Prices of precious metals futures advanced for the third
consecutive day in a continuing rebound from the steep sell-off that
occurred last week after Ford Motor Co. announced its development of
a platinum-free catalytic converter.
   The use of platinum in the automobile pollution-control devices
accounts for about one-third of world platinum consumption. But
analysts say Ford's experimental converter is unlikely to
significantly reduce platinum demand for several years.
   ``We're seeing a natural, very tentative gravitation toward the
prices that we saw before the Ford announcement,'' said Richard
Levine, vice president of precious metals and foreign exchange
trading with Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Platinum settled $1.80 to $8.30 higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange with the spot December contract at $544.20 a troy ounce and
the more actively traded January contract at $540.70 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $2.50 to $2.90
higher with February at $421.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3.8 cents
to 4.4 cents higher with March at $6.268 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade in light, thin trading as players evened up their positions
ahead of the long Christmas weekend.
   After the close, the USDA announced the Soviet Union had
purchased 1 million metric tons of U.S. corn and China had been
awarded 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with March at
$4.38} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with
March at $2.83\ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1\ cents lower with
March at $2.32 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 8{ cents
higher with January at $7.92\ a bushel.
   Frozen pork-belly futures prices fell steeply on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in reaction to Wednesday's monthly USDA
cold-storage report showing supplies of frozen bellies as of Nov. 30
at a record high level for that date.
   Livestock futures finished mixed in lackluster trading.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February
at 73.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .08
cent higher with January at 83.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .18
cent lower to .17 cent higher with February at 46.57 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .98 cent to 1.10 cents lower with February
at 44.07 cents a pound.
   Energy futures advanced in light pre-holiday trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting investor optimism that oil
prices would move higher.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 25 cents
higher at $16.49 a barrel; heating oil was .46 cent to .77 cent
higher with January at 52.48 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.82 cent to .95 cent higher with January at 46.57 cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's
500 settled .40 point lower at 280.05. Each point is worth $500.

   The leading measures of the nation's money supply
rose in the week ended Dec. 12, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the broad measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,066.8 billion in the week ended Dec. 12 from $3,064.8
billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,905.2 billion from $3,899.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $787.0 billion from a revised $786.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $784 billion, a 1.2 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks.
   The Fed said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $445 million,
compared with a decline of $770 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $320 million, down
from $413 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $284.9 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from
$285.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Congressmen Side With Pepperell; Shareholders Meeting Set for Feb.

<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 35 congressmen _ most of them from
textile states _ has complained to top banking and security
officials about Farley Inc.'s unsolicited $1.4 billion bid for West
Point-Pepperell Inc., claiming the proposed deal would weaken the
nation's battle against textile imports.
   The letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder includes
general worries about leveraged buyouts and also echoes Pepperell's
specific charges that the bid is too heavily financed by debt.
   Among those who signed the letter sent this week are Rep. Richard
Ray, D-Ga., whose district includes Pepperell's headquarters in West
Point, Ga., and Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, who will chair the
House Banking Committee in the new Congress.
   Meanwhile, Farley on Thursday again extended its $48-per-share
offer until Jan. 4. The offer originally was made in October, and
has been extended past several expiration dates.
   And Pepperell's board set a special shareholders meeting for Feb.
25. At the meeting, Farley will attempt to replace current board
members with its own nominees who would be expected to rescind
Pepperell's anti-takeover defenses.
   Leveraged buyouts, in which acquisitions are financed with
borrowed money secured by the target's cash flow or assets, ``may be
saddling corporations with a dangerous level of debt which will
restrict their ability to modernize and to weather economic
downturns,'' the congressmen's letter said.
   The 1934 Securities Exchange Act ``directed the Federal Reserve
Board to issue margin regulations to limit the excessive use of
credit in securities transactions,'' the letter said. ``Now, more
than ever, Congress expects the Federal Reserve Board and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to assure that those margin
regulations are enforced.''
   Pepperell has filed suit trying to block Farley's bid, claiming
among other things that the offer violates those regulations, but a
federal district judge ruled against the Georgia company. The case
has been appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals which
has set a Jan. 11 hearing date.
   ``By any objective measure, West Point-Pepperell is a growing and
healthy company,'' the letter says, but Farley's plans to break up
the company after a takeover means ``we risk losing one of the
strongest U.S. competitors in the world's textile market.''
   Textile manufacturers long have complained about what they see as
unfair foreign competition, and the signers of the letter include
some of the leaders in unsuccessful efforts to erect import quotas.
   Of the signers, 21 of the congressmen are from North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama _ all of which have a
concentration of the nation's textile industry.
   Chicago-based Farley, a privately owned conglomerate that
manufactures such items as Fruit of the Loom underwear and Acme
Boots, said Thursday it had been tendered or already owns about 58
percent of Pepperell's outstanding stock.
   Farley also has succeeded in forcing Pepperell to call the
special shareholders meeting, getting holders of more than 25
percent of the outstanding stock to call for the session.
   Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly owned textile company,
has about 29.4 million outstanding shares. Its products include Gold
Toe socks, Arrow shirts and Martex towels.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Backs Out Of Macmillan Unit Purchases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc. said Thursday the buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. had terminated its proposed purchase
of four Macmillan units for $400 million, but the publisher said it
still expected to find buyers for the properties.
   Macmillan, which was acquired for $2.5 billion last month by
Britain's Maxwell Communication Corp., said Kohlberg Kravis
indicated it was dropping the deal due to rising interest rates and
problems in arranging financing for the purchase.
   But a Kohlberg Kravis spokesman said the firm backed out of the
deal because of restrictions set by Macmillan and Maxwell.
   Earlier this month, Macmillan and Maxwell announced they had
agreed to sell Kohlberg their Macmillan Books Clubs Inc., an
operator of several specialty book clubs specializing in the
sciences; Gryphon Editions, which publishes reprints in medicine and
law; Intertec Publishing Corp., which publishes 14 specialty
magazines; and Webb Publishing, which publishes agricultural
magazines.
   Proceeds from the sale were to be used to help pay off some of
the debt incurred in the Maxwell buyout.
   Kohlberg Kravis had backed senior Macmillan managers who
unsuccessfully competed against Maxwell for Macmillan.
   ``KKR suspended moving ahead with this deal because Macmillan and
Maxwell imposed certain structures and special requirements to
complete the transaction by yearend because of tax reasons,'' said
Thomas Daly, a spokesman for Kohlberg Kravis. ``That could not be
done.''
   Daly also said that as negotiations proceeded, the firm decided
``the values initially understood to be there were not there given
the arrangements and structure placed on the transaction by Maxwell
and Macmillan.''
   Macmillan also said in a news release it was confident of getting
buyers for the properties ``at similar prices'' and expected to make
further announcements shortly.
   Dave Jackson, a spokesman for Macmillan and Maxwell North
America, said there were ongoing talks with possible buyers, but
declined to comment on when any deals might be announced.
   Macmillan has outlined a number of divestitures in the wake of
the Maxwell buyout, including the planned sales of its Gumps retail
unit, Katharine Gibbs Schools, Technical Schools and Direct
Marketing Group.
   Macmillan said its previously announced sale of Michie Co. to the
Mead Corp. for $226.5 million was proceeding smoothly. Michie
publishes materials for the legal profession, and Mead is a paper,
forest products and electronic publishing concern.
   Macmillan also announced that the Delaware Chancery Court had
invalidated the so-called ``lock-up'' agreement between Macmillan
and Kohlberg Kravis.
   While battling to thwart Maxwell, Macmillan had agreed to a
buyout by Kohlberg Kravis and granted the firm the option to acquire
four of its prize properties for $865 million in the event their
deal fell through. Such options generally are used to discourage
competing suitors.
   The Delaware Supreme Court enjoined the lock-up, clearing the way
for Maxwell to win the bidding fight, and the Chancery Court removed
the restriction entirely.
   Properties in the lock-up were Macmillan's Directory, Direct
Marketing, Berlitz language school and Michie businesses.

<TEXT>
   A Phoenix holding company acquired 15 insolvent
Texas thrifts Thursday for $120 million and $1.85 billion in
assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,
federal regulators annouced.
   The transaction was part of the Southwest Plan launched last May
to rid Texas of ailing savings and loans and brings to 69 the number
of thrifts consolidated or acquired through the plan.
   The 15 thrifts, located throughout the state, are being
consolidated into a newly chartered federal stock association _
Consolidated Federal Bank FSB _ that will open on Friday, the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board said.
   The thrifts affected by Thursday's acquisition include Commodore
Savings Association, Dallas; Mesquite Savings and Loan Association,
Mesquite; Mineral Wells Savings and Loan Association, Mineral Wells;
Sentry Savings, Slaton; Interwest Savings Association, Fort Worth;
Metroplex Federal Savings Association, Hurst; North Park Savings
Association, Richardson; and Southern Federal Banc SLA, Lancaster.
   Other thrifts involved are First Western Savings and Loan
Association, Colorado City; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Big Spring, Big Spring; Hi-Plains Savings and Loan
Association, Hereford; Reliance Savings Association, Houston; Vista
Savings Association, Odessa; Home Savings, Lufkin; and Lamesa
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Lamesa.
   The holding company acquiring the institutions is headed by James
M. Fail, chairman of several insurance companies, including
Lifeshares Service Co., First United, Inc. and LSC Marketing, Inc.
   The FSLIC is providing an $837 million, 10-year note to restore
net worth, capital loss coverage on certain covered assets and a
yield maintenance agreement on certain assets, the bank board said.
   The FSLIC will receive 25 percent of the tax benefits realized on
a consolidated basis and warrants for 20 percent of consolidated
common stock.
   ``With this investment today, we have now attracted $530.8
million of capital to the Texas thrift industry, which demonstrates
the interest generated among potential acquirers by our plan,'' said
M. Danny Wall, bank board chairman.
   ``We still have a few days left in 1988 and the number of thrifts
we'll act on by year-end, as well as elsewhere, will likely be even
higher.''
   Wall said more than half of the sick Texas thrifts have been
consolidated and to date 175 thrifts have been resolved.

   Assets of the nation's 456 money market mutual
funds fell $2.03 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $278.64 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $2.03 billion drop in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $281.89 billion in the week
ended Nov. 23, 1988.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 228 general purpose funds fell $328.4 million to $89.68
billion, assets of 93 broker-dealer funds dropped $504.7 million to
$117.36 billion, and assets of 135 institutional funds declined
$1.20 billion to $71.60 billion.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.18 percent as of Wednesday from 6.17 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, were unchanged at 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.16
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.12 the
previous week. Yields were 8.43 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.39
percent; 8.55 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.52 percent; and 8.70
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.68 percent.

   Federal regulators announced a plan Thursday to
merge 15 insolvent savings and loan institutions in Texas in a $1.85
billion bailout, bringing to 175 the number of failed that rescued
nationwide this year.
   The 15 Texas S&Ls will be acquired by CFSB Corp. Inc., a holding
company headed by James M. Fail of Phoenix Ariz., who agreed to put
up $120 million to acquire the insolvent institutions.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which guarantees
deposits at 3,000 S&Ls, will provide assistance amounting to $1.85
billion.
   The transaction was part of the Southwest Plan launched last May
to clean up the problems of 109 failed S&Ls in Texas, a state where
financial institutions have been hard-hit by depressed conditions in
real estate and oil.
   The latest rescue package brings the total of failed institutions
which have been closed or merged to 69 in Texas and to 175 around
the country.
   ``We now have consolidated more than half of the 109 Texas
thrifts that were insolvent when we started the Southwest Plan and
we are rapidly moving toward our goal of completing the work in
Texas by the end of the 1989 fiscal year (next Sept. 30),'' said M.
Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which
oversees the FSLIC fund.
   The institutions Fail acquired will reopen Friday as Consolidated
Federal Bank FSB. Consolidated will initially operate all 59 of the
branches of the former institutions, the bank board said.
   Fail is chairman of Lifeshares Service Co. and several other
insurance companies which operate in 47 states.
   The S&Ls involved in Thursday's action include Commodore Savings
Association, Dallas; Mesquite Savings and Loan Association,
Mesquite; Mineral Wells Savings and Loan Association, Mineral Wells;
Sentry Savings, Slaton; Interwest Savings Association, Fort Worth;
Metroplex Federal Savings Association, Hurst; North Park Savings
Association, Richardson; and Southern Federal Banc SLA, Lancaster.
   Other S&Ls involved are First Western Savings and Loan
Association, Colorado City; First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Big Spring, Big Spring; Hi-Plains Savings and Loan
Association, Hereford; Reliance Savings Association, Houston; Vista
Savings Association, Odessa; Home Savings, Lufkin; and Lamesa
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Lamesa.
   The bank board's contribution in the latest group of mergers
brings to more than $24 billion the amount the agency has pledged to
resolve the cases of 175 failed S&Ls this year, up from 48 last year.
   Wall says he wants to do 200 by the end of the year. The board is
rushing to complete transactions because tax breaks for institutions
getting government assistance will be reduced after Jan. 1.
   More than 400 insolvent thrifts remain open and hundreds more are
close to insolvency. Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the
industry range from $50 billion, the bank board's figure, to $112
billion, the estimate of the General Accounting Office, the auditing
arm of Congress.
   The problem is getting worse by more than $1 billion a month.
Industry losses in the first nine months totaled $9.4 billion,
already surpassing the post-Depression record of $7.8 billion set in
1987.
   Private analysts, members of Congress and the GAO have criticized
the bank board for resolving most of the cases through assistance to
private merger partners. The rescues rely heavily on promissory
notes which pledge income the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. expects to receive over the next decade.
   Critics say most of the deals fail to attract enough money from
institutions and investors taking over the failed thrifts. The GAO,
in a report earlier this month, said it may be cheaper in the long
run to give the FSLIC the money to close the institutions and pay
off depositors.
   Congress is planning to begin considering a taxpayer bailout of
FSLIC when it convenes in January.

   The final defendant in the giant Washington Public
Power Supply System securities-fraud trial has settled with
class-action plaintiffs for $20 million, an attorney said Thursday.
   The settlement by Blyth Eastman PaineWebber Inc., which had acted
as a financial adviser to WPPSS, was confirmed by Blyth Eastman
attorney James Hagan.
   The end of the trial came nearly six years after the first
lawsuit was filed in the giant legal action that grew from WPPSS'
default on $2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power
plants. The default was the biggest in the history of the municipal
bond market, and more than 25,000 plaintiffs were involved.
   ``That's the last defendant and that's the end of the trial,''
Hagan said by telephone from his New York office.
   The securities fraud case was being heard by a federal judge in
Tucson, Ariz., where it had been moved from Washington state.
   The settlement brought to about $700 million the total that more
than 100 original defendants have agreed to pay plaintiffs in the
trial. Another $50 million could be collected through contested
insurance claims.
   Total claims by plaintiff bondholders were $1.6 billion, though
the default was on $2.25 billion worth of bonds.
   The trial, which started Sept. 7 before U.S. District Judge
William Browning, was recessed Dec. 1 and had been scheduled to
resume Jan. 9. However, with the settlement, Browning was expected
to dismiss the jurors.
   The judge still must approve 16 separate settlements made over
much of the past year. Four settlements, agreed to as early as
September 1987, have already been approved by Browning.
   Attorneys said they hoped to get the notice of settlements to the
class of plaintiffs by Jan. 16, and to get approval for all of them
in a March hearing.
   With several classes of plaintiffs, as diverse as original bond
buyers and those who purchased bonds at pennies on the dollar just
weeks ago, the judge must also decide how the money is to be
divided. Those who have been close to the case have said it could
still be a year or two before final payments are made to plaintiffs.
   Still to be extracted from the $700 million in settlements are
fees for dozens of attorneys, many of whom have worked on the case
for five years without being paid. Attorneys who have been paid have
collected more than $100 million, separate from the settlements.
   Tens of millions of dollars have also been spent on everything
from computerized systems to keep track of the massive amounts on
data, to remodeling the courtroom for the aborted trial.
   Defendants in the lawsuit, which incorporated dozens of separate
suits filed as early as Feb. 22, 1983 in federal court in Seattle,
included the supply system, the 88 utilities that contracted with
WPPSS to build the two plants, engineering firms, Wall Street bond
underwriters, utility and WPPSS directors and the advisory firm of
Blyth Eastman.
   The default was on bonds WPPSS sold to finance construction
starting in the late 1970s on its plants No. 4, at the Hanford
nuclear reservation, and No. 5, at Satsop, west of Olympia.
   WPPSS abandoned the plants in 1982 and default occurred in July
1983 after the Washington state Supreme Court ruled that utilities
participating in construction of the plants lacked authority to sign
contracts with WPPSS guaranteeing payment even if no electricity was
generated.

<HEAD>Bush Names Sullivan, Three Others to Cabinet</HEAD>

   President-elect Bush named Louis Sullivan to be
secretary of health and human services Thursday, pushing aside a
controversy over Sullivan's abortion views. He also announced three
other Cabinet choices and an environmental chief as he neared
completion of his administration's top ranks.
   The selection of Sullivan, the first black in Bush's Cabinet, had
been opposed by anti-abortion groups, especially after an interview
last weekend in which he said women should have a right to choose
abortion. He has taken a strongly anti-abortion stance in comments
since then.
   Bush characterized Sullivan as a man with ``great credentials''
and said the 55-year-old medical educator shared most of his own
beliefs on abortion. ``We're going to opt on the side of life,'' the
vice president said.
   Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of Medicine in
Atlanta, made a point of saying at the announcement that his
position was ``the same as that of President-elect Bush's,'' against
abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's
life.
   In his other announcements, Bush named:
   _Samuel Skinner, a Chicago transit official and former federal
prosecutor, as secretary of transportation.
   _Manuel Lujan Jr., the outgoing veteran congressman from New
Mexico, as secretary of interior.
   _Edward J. Derwinski, a State Department lawyer and former
Illinois congressman, as head of the newly created Veterans Affairs
Department.
   _William Reilly, head of the World Wildlife Fund, to head the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Facing reporters after making his announcements, Bush was asked
about a State Department statement that U.S. embassies had been
informed of a terrorist threat against Pan Am more than two weeks
before a Pan Am plane en route to New York exploded and crashed in
Scotland on Wednesday.
   Bush, citing experience as CIA director, said most threats
``never materialize.''
   If there were ``hard evidence that a specific flight was going to
be threatened or that the threat could not be contained, clearly you
would want to serve the public good by notifying people,'' he added.
   Bush made his Cabinet announcements after meeting privately with
ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delalle. The vice president
said the policy of his new administratrion would be to continue to
press for the ouster of Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   He sidestepped a question on whether he would be more or less
likely to use force against Noriega than President Reagan had been.
``I am as determined as President Reagan is that Noriega not
continue in his dictatorial ways. ... I'm just going to have to not
respond more directly to what the United States might or might not
do,'' he said.
   On anther topic, Bush was asked whether he would consider
military action to destroy a Libyan chemical weapon factory _ an
option that Reagan in a television interview had suggested was under
consideration.
   ``I think the answer is to discuss that in considerable detail''
at a Jan. 7-11 conference of more than 100 nations in Paris to
review international conventions against the use of poison gas and
chemical weapons, he said.
   If there is a direct refusal by Libya to comply with any
international consensus that develops from that conference ``then we
will consider options at that time,'' Bush said.
   The president-elect has now named heads of the 12 Cabinet
departments, with labor and energy to go.
   As has been his custom, he appeared Thursday with his new
appointees, each of whom spoke briefly. When it was noted that some
of the appointments had come as a surprise, and appeared to be
last-minute decisions, Bush joked, ``It's surprising to what lengths
a person will go to fool you all.''
   The nomination of Skinner, 50, chairman of the Regional
Transportation Authority of Northeastern Illinois, had been expected
for more than a week. He is a former federal prosecutor, a former
executive with the IBM Corp., a pilot and a longtime political
supporter of Bush's.
   Both he and Bush mentioned his job would include supervision of
the Coast Guard, and they promised to improve its drug-intercepting
efforts. Skinner said he was ready ``to roll up my sleeves and go to
work.''
   Lujan, 60, has served the Albuquerque area in Congress since
1968. He becomes the second Hispanic named to Bush's Cabinet,
joining Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos. Addressing his new duties
at the Interior Department, he said with apparent emotion, ``If one
little piece of our public trust is desecrated, we all suffer for
it.''
   Lujan's brother, Ed, said he had been in Washington the day
before to attend a meeting with Bush and Hispanic leaders and that
Bush took him aside and asked him, ``where he could find Manuel
right then. I gave him the numbers I had and he called and asked
Manuel to meet with him last night at his home.''
   Derwinski, 62, a World War II veteran, had not figured in
speculation about the veterans affairs post, and he said the offer
from Bush came only a few hours before the formal announcement. The
old Veterans Administration becomes a full-fledged Cabinet agency in
March, and he said he would spend the weeks before then putting
together an efficient bureaucracy.
   Earlier, transition aides had suggested that retired three-star
Army General Julius W. Becton Jr. who now heads the Federal
Emergency Planning Agency, had been in line for the veterans job.
   Asked what happened to Becton, who would have been the Cabinet's
second black man, Bush said: ``What happened to him? He's doing very
well. He's doing a superb job in that FEMA.''
   Reilly, 48, said he believed he was the first head of a
conservation organization chosen to run the EPA, and he said that
reflected ``how the president-elect views the work ahead of us.''
   The storm over Sullivan's abortion views presented the sharpest
political challenge Bush has faced thus far in filling his Cabinet.
   The outcry arose after Sullivan said in an interview in Sunday's
Atlanta Journal and Constitution that he privately supported a
woman's right to choose abortion though he opposed federal funding
for the procedure.
   Under sharp criticism from the Republican right, Sullivan later
told conservative lawmakers that he shared Bush's anti-abortion
views including a proposed ``human life amendment'' to the
Constitution.
   Asked on Thursday whether, like Bush, he would favor criminal
sanctions against doctors who perform abortions _ if the procedure
were made illegal _ but not against the pregnant woman, Sullivan
retorted, ``Questions on prosecution are best left to prosecuting
authorities.''
   Bush was asked whether his own position didn't constitute a
double standard. ``It might appear to be a double standard to some
... but that's exactly how I feel,'' he said.
   John C. Willke, president of th National Right to Life Committee,
said in a statement Thursday that ``there are still many unanswered
questions about Dr. Sullivan's position.''
   Friends have described Sullivan as a political independent, but
with close personal ties to both Bush and to his wife. Barbara Bush
has been a member of the medical school's board of trustees since
1983.
   Bush has not yet named a woman to head any of the government's 14
Cabinet agencies. However, transition sources said Federal
Communications Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis is on a short list
of contenders for the post of labor secretary.

   Coca-Cola Enterprises said Thursday it would buy
back 5.3 million of its shares by the end of the year.
   The Coca-Cola Co. bottling subsidiary, which has already
repurchased 2.5 million shares from the public in 1988, said in a
statement it intends to buy the 5.3 million shares from its parent
company before the end of 1988.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises stock closed at $14.62{ a share in New York
Stock Exchange trading Wednesday. At that price, the buyback would
cost the company $77.5 million.
   The stock repurchase is part of a buyback of 25 million shares
that Coca-Cola Enterprises plans to finish by the end of 1990.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises said it plans to repurchase approximately
13 million shares from Coca-Cola Co. and approximately 12 million
shares from public shareholders over the course of the repurchase
program, which has the goal of adjusting Coca-Cola Co. ownership to
49 percent.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises also announced Thursday it completed the
sale of The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Mid-America to the
Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc. on Dec. 16.

   Scandinavian Airlines Services on Thursday ordered
four extended-range Boeing 767-300s in a deal worth about $300
million, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said.
   With the order, SAS has bought 13 of the twin-engine widebody
planes this year, worth approximately $1 billion. The airline holds
options for 11 more of the jets.
   SAS is to take delivery of its first 767-300ER in March.
   The first of the planes ordered Thursday will be delivered in
July 1990, Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said.
   Boeing has had orders for 632 commercial jets worth a total $29.5
billion this year, an industry record.
   A 767-300ER can carry 216 passengers and has a range of up to
7,200 miles. SAS's planes will be equipped with Pratt & Whitney
PW4000 engines.

<HEAD>Perot Loses Medicaid Contract to Old Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Electronic Data Systems Corp. has beat out
its former chairman, H. Ross Perot, for a lucrative contract to run
the Texas Medicaid program, state officials said Thursday.
   National Heritage Insurance Co., an EDS subsidiary that has run
and maintained the Texas Medicaid program since 1977, was competing
against Perot Systems Corp. for the contract, which involves the
processing of $1.1 billion a year in Medicaid claims.
   Under the contract, EDS will get $25 million a year for
administration, and up to 5 percent of that could be retained as
profit. The previous contract allowed up to 10 percent for profit.
   George Newstrom, an NHI senior vice president, said the
Dallas-based company could earn up to another $4.9 million a year if
it saves the state money in Medicaid claims. However, because it
shares in the risk of the program, it also could lose up to $4.9
million annually, he said.
   The contract is for four years, and it has two two-year
extensions at the state's option.
   H. Ross Perot founded the computer company EDS in 1962 and sold
it to General Motors in 1986, joining the GM board in the process.
He formed Perot Systems after breaking with GM in a dispute over
management of the automaker.
   The state Department of Human Services staff said the bid
submitted by Perot Systems did not meet technical requirements, said
Steve Svadlenak, associate commissioner for budget and economic
analysis.
   When representatives of the companies submitted their bids, the
offer by EDS included 11 boxes of documents. Perot's was in two
manila envelopes.
   When informed of omissions in the proposed bid, Svadlenak said,
Perot Systems said it could not meet the requirements because it did
not have access to the existing computer system used by EDS.
   The department staff found EDS complied with state requirements
regarding access to potential bidders.
   The bid by Perot Systems marked the company's first formal effort
to compete with EDS since a Virginia judge ruled in October Perot
could go after the same data processing business as his old company
as long as he does not enter into contracts that provide for profits
until after next December.
   The current EDS contract expires Aug. 31, 1989.

   Shareholders of NL Industries Inc. overwhelmingly
have approved a previously-announced restructuring that spins off
the company's petroleum services business into a new publicly-held
company, officials said Thursday.
   The restructuring, effective Thursday, leaves NL with only its
chemical operation.
   Under the plan, the company redeemed its Series C preferred stock
and declared a one-for-10 reverse split of its outstanding common
stock. Preferred shareholders could get either one share of
post-split stock or $15.66 cash for each of their Series C shares.
   The transactions leave preferred shareholders controlling 90
percent of the surviving company and former common shareholders
holding 10 percent.
   NL common stockholders also received on a pro-rata basis all of
the outstanding common stock of the newly spun-off petroleum
business, Baroid Corp.
   Valhi Corp., NL Industries' parent, will control about 52 percent
of Baroid's 61 million outstanding common shares. Valhi will control
about 66 percent of NL's 66 million outstanding common shares.
   Baroid Corp. common stock and post-split NL common stock were
expected to begin trading Friday on the New York and Pacific Stock
exchanges under the symbols ``BRC'' and ``NL'' respectively.
   Houston-based Baroid is a worldwide supplier of petroleum
services. NL, as restructured, will consist primarily of the
business of NL Chemicals Inc.

<HEAD>Two Major Japanese Shipping Firms To Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major Japanese shipping firms announced Friday
that they will combine operations next year in what potentially will
be Japan's largest shipping company, in an apparent response to the
economic blow dealt by the strong yen.
   Details outlining the merger plan between Japan Line Ltd., one of
the world's leading tanker operators, and Yamashita-Shinnihon were
signed Friday, officials said.
   While the officials refused to reveal details, the merged
companies' combined current capital of about $579.8 million far
outstrips Nippon Yusen, currently Japan's biggest shipping company
with capital of about $467.7 million.
   ``The yen's rapid rise was particularly a severe blow for us,''
said an official of Yamashita-Shinnihon, one of Japan's six core
shipping companies.
   ``At the time when the entire industry is in a deep slump, we aim
to rationalize operations through the merger,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The export-heavy shipping industry has been particulary hit by
the strengthening of the yen against the U.S. dollar over the past
several years. A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive
overseas, and many firms have been forced to close down plants and
cut back on their work force because of slashed profits.
   Officials said Japan Line suffered a cumulative loss estimated at
$403.2 million while Yamashita-Shinnihon lost about $201.6 million.
   Transport Minister Shintaro Ishihara welcomed the merger, and
said, ``I hope such a move as this will revitalize the sluggish
industry.'' His comments were carried Japan Broadcasting Corp.
   The merger is the largest of its kind in the shipping industry
since 1964, when the ministry orchestrated a series of mergers
between dozens of small- and medium-sized firms into six major
companies.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Texaco And Chevron To Pay $2.9 Million Oil Concession
Royalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered Texaco Inc., a Texaco
subsidiary and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. to pay $2.9 million in back
royalties for an oil concession in Ecuador to an Albany, Ga., oil
and mining company.
   The order filed by U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler last week
concludes a 12-year-old lawsuit filed by Norsul Oil & Mining Co.
Ltd. against Texaco Inc. and a Texaco subsidiary and against Gulf
Oil Corp., now Chevron U.S.A. Inc.
   The lawsuit claimed a contract between Norsul and the defendants
provided for the transfer of an oil concession in Ecuador from
Norsul in exchange for the payment of royalties to Norsul. The
royalties were to have been based on the production of oil within
the property in consideration.
   Norsul's attorneys have contended the defendants used an
unreliable and unapplicable survey to show improperly that an oil
well known as Shushufindi No. 1 in Ecuador, the greatest producer
within the area transferred, was exempt from royalty payments.
   Hoeveler ruled as valid Norsul's claims that the defendants were
guilty of breach of contract. He ordered the defendants to pay $2.93
million to Norsul in back royalties and that royalties continue to
be paid until termination of the contract.
   The rate of royalty payment amounts to about 1 percent of the
rate of production of Shushufindi No. 1, which in February was
measured at about 3,500 barrels per day. By early 1988, Shushufindi
No. 1 had produced an estimated 17 million barrels of oil since its
production began in 1972.
   Norsul Oil & Mining is a Canadian corporation with its principal
office in Albany, Ga.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe flew to
Washington Wednesday night for talks on Mexico's $102 billion
foreign debt, the Treasury Department said.
   Aspe was to hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary-designate
Nicolas Brady and with Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, the
department said in a brief statement.
   Mexico's new president, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, wants debt
payments cut so the stagnant Mexican economy can begin growing again
and has has made renegotiating the debt, the second highest in the
developing world after Brazil's, a top priority.
   Aspe told congressmen last week that he hopes to persuade foreign
creditors to reduce debt payments from the current level of about 5
percent of the gross national product to about 3 percent.
   He said Salinas had sent a proposal to creditor banks in the
United States and Europe.
   Aspe did not disclose the details of the proposal. But the Mexico
City financial daily El Financiero said it would nearly halve the
amount Mexico expects to pay in 1989 and devote more of the payments
to principal, rather than interest.
   Debt payments amounted to about $14 billion in 1988 and are
expected to reach $16 billion in 1989.
   Salinas said in his first budget last week that Mexico's economy
will begin growing again toward the end of 1989 after debt payments
fall. He predicted 1.5 percent growth in the gross national product,
nearly four times that of 1988.
   Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil producer, began
accumulating its huge debt in a borrowing spree during the oil boom
of the late 1970s. When the bottom fell out of the international oil
market in 1982, the Mexican economy nosedived into a crisis that
still grips the nation.
