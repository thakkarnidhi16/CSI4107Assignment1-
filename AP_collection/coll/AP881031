   A school board member took $8,000 in bribes
from two teachers seeking promotions to vice principal, a federal
grand jury charged Monday.
   Malcolm George, 32, of Newark, was indicted by the panel on two
counts of bribe-taking and two counts of extortion by a public
official. He faces 60 years in prison if convicted on all counts.
   George, the board's second vice president, allegedly took $5,000
from one teacher as early as spring 1987 and $3,000 from another
teacher last August in exchange for improving their chances for
promotion, the indictment said.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. declined to identify the
teachers or their schools or say if they were ever promoted.
   ``This is part of a continuing investigation into activities of
this type,'' Alito said.
   Sheldon Bross, a board attorney, said he believes the teachers
were not promoted.
   George could not be reached Monday. His phone number is
unlisted, and his attorney, C. Robert Sarcone, did not return a
message.
   No date has been set for George to appear in court. He was not
arrested.
   Authorities said George was a former Essex County employee but
did not know his current occupation.

<HEAD>Firm Owned By Two GOP Staffers Solicits Haiti For Lobbying, Report
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political consulting firm led by two top
officials in George Bush's presidential campaign has offered to
represent the government of Haiti, citing the firm's ability to
work in ``the transitional environment in Washington,'' The Orlando
Sentinel reported Tuesday.
   ``Given the fragile environment in Haiti and the ensuing
presidential election in the United States there exists a window of
opportunity for us to combine our resources and energies for the
mutual benefit of our two countries,'' stated the letter from Bush
& Co.
   The letter, dated Oct. 12, also expressed hope that Avril would
``retain our services.''
   The Washington firm is run by GOP campaign officials Frederick
M. Bush, who is unrelated to the vice president, and Margaret
Alexander.
   The letter to Haitian president Prosper Avril appeared to be
signed by Frederick Bush, but he told the newspaper Monday that his
name had been signed by an associate without his permission or his
knowledge.
   ``This upsets me very much,'' he said. ``This was totaly
unauthorized. I want nothing to do with the government of Haiti.''
   The switchboard operator at Bush's headquarters in Washington
said no one was available late Monday for comment.
   Bush, 39, is deputy finance chairman of the vice president's
election campaign. He was a White House staffer and the vice
president's deputy chief of staff during President Reagan's first
term.
   Alexander is both Bush & Co.'s vice president and finance
director for this year's GOP presidential bid. She was on the
finance committee for the Reagan-Bush 1984 re-election campaign.
   The letter sent by Bush & Co. offered Avril a variety of
lobbying services and said, ``We are confident that we can
effectively work in the transitional environment in Washington to
assist Haiti.''
   Frederick Bush acknowledged he was aware the Haitian government
``had requested information about the company several weeks ago,''
but he said he wanted no part of any subsequent discussions.
   ``I specifically said that I would not be involved,'' he said.
   Bush said that he has not been active in the company for the
past two years because of his fund-raising duties for the vice
president.
   An attachment to the two-page letter, however, promoted Bush's
position with the GOP presidential campaign and Bush's background
as a White House staffer.
   Six weeks ago Avril's regime ousted the government that had been
having trouble conducting a peaceful election. After a November
1987 election was canceled because of violence, the U.S. government
cut off $89 million in aid. Only food and development aid has
continued through international humanitarian organizations.
   U.S. officials, while pleased with recent steps taken by Avril
to improve the political climate and reign in Haiti's military,
have said there is little prospect of renewing the full foreign-aid
package until the new administration and the new Congress take
office in January.

<HEAD>Utilities Vote To Settle In Giant Securities Fraud Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen public utilities across Washington state
voted Monday to approve a $226 million settlement letting them out
of the giant Washington Public Power Supply System securities fraud
trial in Tucson, Ariz.
   ``It's a (settlement) we can certainly live with and handle, and
it won't have great diverse ... impact on our state,'' said Tacoma
attorney Albert Malanca, who engineered the complex agreement
involving utilities, the state of Washington and the federal
Bonneville Power Administration.
   While several utilities agreeing to the settlement on Monday
said rate increases may be necessary, they added that those
increases would be small and the economic damage to the Northwest
region minimal.
   Under terms of the agreement, the 14 utilities would pay $181
million, BPA and the federal government would pay $35 million and
the state would pay $10 million to plaintiffs who sued after WPPSS
defaulted in 1983 on $2.25 billion in bonds used to build two
nuclear power plants. The plaintiffs include more than 24,000 past
and present bondholders.
   The plants were begun but never finished after regional energy
planners determined power from the plants wouldn't be needed. The
region's economy suffered when WPPSS attempted to build five
multibillion dollar nuclear power plants and finished only one.
   In Olympia, Gov. Booth Gardner announced the state would pay $10
million toward the settlement, if the Legislature concurs.
Washington state faces a separate lawsuit involving the same
plaintiffs.
   BPA participation still requires the approval of the U.S.
Department of Justice, which is expected this week, and final
approval will have to come from U.S. District Judge William
Browning, who is overseeing the trial in Tucson.
   The pact leaves Snohomish County Public Utility District the
only utility remaining as a defendant in the trial, although it has
an option to settle until Nov. 10. Snohomish contracted for the
biggest single share, 13 percent, on the two terminated WPPSS
plants.
   The trial, over the largest municipal bond default in history,
was recessed last week in Tucson when attorneys reported a
settlement was possible. It was scheduled to resume Wednesday.
Besides Snohomish, other defendants remaining include two
engineering firms and a financial adviser firm.
   The price for Snohomish if it takes up the Nov. 10 option would
be $48.7 million. That would be in line with the $3.7 million
per-percentage-point of interest in the two abandoned nuclear
plants other defendant utilities agreed to pay.
   Tacoma director of utilities Ted Coates said the settlement
would bring to $591 million the amount paid to the class of
plaintiffs in the giant federal lawsuit.
   Settlements during the past year have removed most defendants
and totaled $365 million in cash. In addition to the $591 million
would be $96 million in contested insurance claims.
   Coates estimated the settlement would add 3{ to 4 percent to
Tacoma City Light's expenses. He said the city planned to pay the
bill through floating long-term bonds.
   Under terms of the agreements, most utilities would have to make
initial payments Dec. 15, with final payments Dec. 15, 1989.
Interest would be paid, according to the agreement.
   The settlement memorandum noted some utilities could recover
substantial amounts through insurance carriers that have so far
``refused to pay the insurance coverage contracted for.''

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor filed an $800 million
defamation lawsuit Monday against Tawana Brawley, the black
teen-ager who a grand jury said concocted a story of abduction and
rape by six white men.
   Dutchess County prosecutor Steven Pagones' lawsuit also named as
defendants the Rev. Al Sharpton and lawyers C. Vernon Mason and
Alton Maddox, advisers to Miss Brawley who had claimed that Pagones
was involved in the purported attack last November.
   A grand jury cleared Pagones of any involvement in the case that
began when Miss Brawley, then 16, was found in Wappingers Falls
smeared with dog feces and with racial slurs written on her body.
   Miss Brawley never cooperated with the grand jury, and her
advisers dismissed the resulting report as the product of a racist
system.
   ``I hope he goes through with it,'' Sharpton said in response to
the lawsuit Monday.
   ``Well, I think that Mr. Pagones has the potential of making
history in being the first man to sue himself into jail,'' he said.
   Sharpton said Miss Brawley would tell her story in court and,
along with other witnesses, would prove Pagones' involvement.
   ``He will be proven guilty of rape and sodomy and will go to
jail,'' Sharpton said.
   Mason had no comment on the lawsuit, according to a receptionist
at his law office. Maddox did not immediately return telephone
calls for comment.
   Pagones' lawyer, Gerald Hayes, also did not return telephone
calls.
   Pagones had said at a news conference on Oct. 10 that he
intended to file suit.

   The southern city of Basra, devastated by
the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, now has been invaded by swarms of
desert locusts, the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture says.
   A report on state-run television Monday said six separate clouds
of the crop-devouring insects were in the city, but that the
ministry was using helicopters to bring the situation under control.
   No further details were immediately available. Locusts can eat
twice their body weight every day, so the swarms are sprayed with
insecticides to keep them from reaching agricultural areas.
   Locusts from Sudan and Ethiopia have swept across the Arabian
peninsula in the past two weeks.
   The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said in a recent
report that the spread of locusts represents ``a lateral extension
of the plague, which will make control efforts much more
difficult.''

   At the direction of President Chadli
Bendjedid, the Justice Ministry has decided to release
provisionally everyone who was arrested during the October riots,
the official news agency reported.
   Algerie Presse Service said Monday that the decision was taken
``in application of the orientations received from the president
and on the occasion of the 34th anniversary of Nov. 1, 1954.''
   The Algerian revolution began on that date, resulting in
independence from France eight years later.
   The number of people set free was not revealed. Earlier, an
unstated number of minors were let go.
   Officially, 159 people died in the riots and 154 were injured.
Unofficial reports put the death toll at 400 or more in
disturbances that started over rising prices and food shortages.
   The move comes three days before a nationwide referendum on
political reforms.

<HEAD>Shipyard Closure Seen as Attempt to Cripple Solidarity</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever sense it may make on solely
economic grounds, the decision to shut the Lenin shipyard is a slap
at the Solidarity trade union movement at a time the government
ostensibly is seeking dialogue.
   The closing poses a difficult challenge for union leader Lech
Walesa, who has been preaching economic reform but undoubtedly did
not want it to begin by eliminating his workplace and political
base.
   Monday's announcement follows closely a government demand that
Walesa remove two longtime Solidarity advisers from his delegation
to promised ``round-table'' talks with authorities, which were to
start in mid-October.
   Walesa refused and the talks now appear in jeopardy.
   The developments underscore an end to the accommodative mood on
both sides that briefly seemed to dominate Polish politics after
Walesa ended a series of strikes in early September in exchange for
the promise of the talks on Solidarity's future.
   The government has taken a more energetic, decisive tone since
the ascension to prime minister last month of Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski, the party propaganda chief and a longtime Solidarity foe.
   Rakowski has said the situation is too urgent to wait for talks
with the opposition before trying to revitalize the economy.
   But the opposition, which has long distrusted Rakowski,
questions whether he is interested in talks at all.
   Rakowski said in a broadcast interview Monday that the decision
to close the Gdansk shipyard Dec. 1 and liquidate it over the next
year was purely economic and had ``nothing to do with Solidarity.''
   The official media gave heavy coverage to the decision, but made
no mention of the shipyard's symbolic importance as the birthplace
and stronghold of the only independent labor movement allowed in
the Soviet bloc.
   The official news agency PAP said the state-owned shipyard,
Poland's largest, has been losing money and increasingly draining
the public treasury.
   But Walesa said it was no coincidence that the shipyard was the
first industrial enterprise in the country to fall victim to the
budget ax.
   ``Premier Rakowski's decision was not dictated by economic
reasons,'' he said, calling the move Rakowski's ``personal
provocation'' against the yard where Solidarity sprang to life in
August 1980 after a nationwide strike wave.
   While vowing to fight the closing, Walesa said he agreed the
``economy needs restructuring and basic changes. Solidarity is and
has been for those changes.''
   But he said the yard could be saved by dismissing incompetent
managers and allowing workers to run it more efficiently themselves.
   Historian Bronislaw Geremek, a close Walesa adviser, said
Solidarity always was prepared to accept painful economic choices
in the course of reform. But those steps were supposed to be a
subject for agreement in the now-delayed talks with authorities, he
said.
   By deciding unilaterally to close the shipyard, Rakowski
``either buried the chances for the round table or considered the
round table already buried,'' Geremek said. ``If such decisions are
taken without first achieving a social contract, then what one
wants to prove is that there is no need for such a way, no need for
dialogue.''
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, called
the government's move a political ``masterstroke''.
   If Solidarity strikes, it will lend credence to Rakowski's
argument that the union is unreasonable and poses an obstacle to
efforts to reform Poland's inefficient, debt-ridden economy.
   And by shutting down the shipyard, the strikers would only be
hastening what the government wants to do next month anyway.
   But if Solidarity does not mount a protest to defend its home
base, Walesa and the Solidarity leadership run the risk of seeming
toothless to militant followers at home and would-be supporters
abroad.
   Poland's first major plant closing is likely to send shock waves
through factories nationwide. But because the closing was announced
during a four-day holiday weekend, it was difficult to immediately
judge the degree of public sympathy for the workers.
   The government, meanwhile, was trying to take the sting out of
the closure for the approximately 10,000 workers facing layoffs. It
said state enterprises have far more than enough jobs going begging
in Gdansk province at equal or higher pay. And it promised free job
retraining for those who need it.
   Ironically and perhaps not accidentally, Rakowski made the move
only days before Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain is due
to arrive for a visit that is to include a trip to Gdansk to see
Walesa on Friday.
   Official commentators have been drawing parallels between
Rakowski's plans to overhaul Poland's economy and the toughness
shown by Mrs. Thatcher in facing down the unions and cutting back
money-losing state industry in Britain.

   Anti-personnel mines designed to maim
an enemy remain scattered about Afghanistan and must be cleared
before more than 5 million refugees in Pakistan and Iran can return
home, United Nations officials say.
   The mines are estimated to range in number from hundreds of
thousands to 5 million. Some look like toys and are small enough to
fit in the palm of a person's hand. If picked up, they can blow
away a hand; if stepped on, a victim can lose a foot.
   Zia Rizvi, spokesman for the U.N. Economic and Humanitarian
Program for Afghan refugees, said the landmines have to be found
and defused before a billion-dollar rebuilding program can begin.
   The devices are believed to have been laid by Soviet and Afghan
government forces during their nine-year war against Moslem
insurgents. The insurgents also have laid a number of anti-tank
devices.
   Teams of mine-clearing experts from the United States, Britain,
France and Turkey have been in Pakistan to plan a training program
designed to show Afghans how to locate, identify and defuse the
mines.
   A $9-million training program is scheduled to begin shortly,
Rizvi said.
   Clearing the mines ``is a pre-requisite to any (rebuilding)
activity,'' said Rizvi.
   The Soviets are not a contributor to the mine-clearing effort,
but they ``have assured us of their total cooperation,'' said Rizvi.
   Since the April signing of an accord providing for the
withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the
United Nations has begun mobilizing for one of the largest refugee
movements in its history.
   Rizvi said the widespread use of the landmines ``is a comment on
the people who make, sell, buy and use them.''
   The U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, known as the Mujahedeen, have
been fighting the Afghanistan's Marxist government since it seized
power in 1978. The Soviet Union entered the conflict in December
1979.
   Fifteen different types of anti-personnel mines have been
identified along with five models of anti-tank mines, Rizvi said.
   In addition to the anti-personnel devices that resemble toys are
are scattered around villages, another common type is a bright
green plastic device that looks like a butterfly and fits into the
palm of a hand.
   Rizvi said unexploded ordnance of other kinds, such as dud
bombs, also are scattered around the Afghan countryside.
   The first task of foreign mine-detecting experts will be to make
Afghans aware of what to look for. Rizvi said children will be
educated to the dangers as well.
   Foreign experts will train Afghans who in turn will pass on
their knowledge to others, he said.
   Eventually, said Rizvi, an Afghan mine-clearing team would be
established in most villages or cluster of villages.

   Emperor Hirohito discharged small amounts of blood
early today and his blood pressure fell, but palace officials
described the 87-year-old monarch's condition as stable after a
serious weekend setback.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said Hirohito discharged blood
early today but added that doctors did not administer another
transfusion.
   He told reporters that palace physicians described the discharge
as remnants of blood lost Saturday night and Sunday morning.
   The world's longest reigning monarch has been bedridden since
falling ill with internal hemorrhaging on Sept. 19.
   Despite a drop in the emperor's blood pressure today, Maeda said
doctors were not ``particularly concerned.'' He said the emperor
was fully conscious this morning, chatting with his physicians.
   On Sunday, Hirohito's blood pressure had dropped dangerously low
and he received a total of 3.8 pints of blood in the largest
transfusion since becoming bedridden.
   Since Sept. 19, the emperor has received 31.5 pints of blood,
about three times the normal amount in his body.
   Hirohito has not taken any solid food since falling ill, with
the exception of a few spoons of porridge. He is being fed
intravenously, receiving some 600-700 calories daily.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny media reports
that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.

<TEXT>
   The Taylor Highway, a rib-jarring gravel
washboard that snakes through mining hills northeast of this
interior Alaska village, doesn't rate much mention in the tourist
brochures.
   But the Taylor is Larry Champagne's specialty. He drives a tow
truck and, as they say in the trade, business is picking up. He sat
the other day in his Chevron station and pointed out the highway's
latest victim: a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows.
   ``He was passing a motor home on a curve, got over too far, and
t-h-p-p-t, into the river,'' he said. Champagne was happy to haul
the van and its uninjured driver back to Tok, for $700.
   A 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of Alaska
highways were in fair to poor condition. But the potholes and frost
heaves don't slow the flow of vacationers. Growing herds of
tourists not only keep Champagne smiling but also help fuel debate
over this frontier state's transportation future.
   More roads! say business leaders who see a young and developing
state with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits.
   Stop the bulldozers! cry environmentalists who see a pristine
land needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower
48 states.
   The arguments likely will continue as long as there are places
people cannot drive to, and much of Alaska fits that category. The
state's 11,600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeastern
quarter, leaving vast areas untracked.
   One-fourth of Alaska's half-million residents live unconnected
by road to the outside world. Of 151 incorporated communities, 133
are unconnected, including the state capital of Juneau.
   Given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that cover
much of Alaska, it's a wonder roads were ever built.
   Turn-of-the-century gold rushes spurred the first major
construction. In World War II, concerns about a Japanese invasion
prompted another building frenzy; the 1,520-mile Alaska Highway,
Alaska's first overland link to the lower 48, was finished in just
nine months.
   Since statehood in 1959, expansion has continued steadily. The
latest road, completed this summer in northwestern Alaska, is a
54-mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as Red Dog.
   ``I try not to think about that,'' said Susan Alexander, state
representative for the Wilderness Society, which unsuccessfully
fought the road's route through Cape Krusenstern National Monument.
   She said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resulting
development and pollution. She cited the 416-mile Dalton Highway,
built in 1974 to link Fairbanks and the Prudhoe Bay oil fields.
Although only the highway's southern half is open to the public,
lax enforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north, and
Alexander worries about the effect on wildlife.
   ``Increased access means increased poaching, and there
definitely has been poaching along the road. The road lets in
people, hunters, who wouldn't have been there otherwise,'' she said.
   Letting more people into Alaska is what economic boosters have
had in mind for years. Wherever roads have gone, tourism has
followed. U.S. Customs officials say 38,150 vehicles _ about 70
percent of them motor homes and campers _ entered the state on the
Alaska Highway last year.
   Roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote mining
more competitive, say the boosters, who over the years have
proposed dozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map.
   In 1977, travel guides called the 152-mile Elliott Highway near
Fairbanks the ``Road to Nome,'' even though it dead-ended, and
still does, 500 miles short of the Bering Sea town.
   In 1986, the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce suggested a
road that would head 200 miles southwest from Denali National Park
to McGrath, then swing north another 200 miles to the Yukon River.
   In southeastern Alaska, plans surface occasionally to connect
Juneau to highways that now stop in Haines and Skagway.
   But such projects, each estimated to cost hundreds of millions
of dollars, are distant dreams for state officials who can barely
raise the $52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads.
   Alaska's oil-dependent government has grown cautious since the
oil boom busted, and the state Department of Transportation plans
no major highway expansion. It would cost $600 million just to
bring Alaska's rural highways up to standards, said Ron Lind, the
agency's planning and budget director.
   Patterns of land use and ownership also discourage
road-building. National parks, preserves and monuments now cover 50
million of Alaska's 375 million acres. Natives, protective of open
space needed for subsistence hunting and fishing, own 44 million
acres.
   But things could change quickly in Alaska's boom-bust economy.
As publisher Robert Henning wrote in an Alaska Geographic book
called ``Adventure Roads North'':
   ``Strong anti-roads sentiments of environmentalist groups have
slowed Alaskan road construction, but in the history of the North,
there has ever been the cry for `more roads, more trails,' and it
is inevitable that the road building will continue. ... Like it or
not, it seems to be the American way.''
   Wherever and whenever roads are built, the likes of Larry
Champagne will be there to pick up the pieces. Back at the Chevron
station, Champagne was smiling again; a Winnebago driver was in for
the second time that day with a flat tire.
   Champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cash
register. ``That'll be $10,'' he said. ``You have a nice day.''

   The City of Light sits on a subterranean city of
darkness, a vast network of stone quarries that has given refuge to
scoundrels, saints and the bones of 6 million souls. It is where
the Phantom of the Opera set up house. Here is a report by an AP
correspondent who visited the catacombs.

<TEXT>
   The Phantom was laid to rest long ago in the
cellars of the Opera, but figures nearly as macabre still haunt the
catacombs that wind through the belly of Paris like entrails and
conceal millions of human bones.
   Each weekend, dozens of people slip out of their city skins and
into the maze on which the city rests. They descend as far as 90
feet into a world where night is eternal, the unexpected waits at
each turn and the game is to the fearless.
   Some are history buffs seeking the dank breath of ancient Paris,
others are adventurers and still others inhabit a marginal world
whether above ground or below.
   They are called ``cataphiles'' and are drawn, as if by
enchantment, to the darkness beneath the City of Light. They tread
in the footsteps of sorcerers, bandits, smugglers, the quick and
the sly who haunted the tunnels centuries ago.
   Many who spend time below use nicknames _ ``Destroy,''
``Calamity'' or ``Professor Sato'' _ and dress in exaggerated punk
or skinhead style.
   The eternal, eerie silence and stillness enclose a voyager who
weaves through the sand-colored maze of galleries, rooms, nooks and
niches as if pulled along by the flashlight beam.
   Fossils of ancient creatures are imbedded in walls nicked by the
pickaxes of workers long dead. Minuscule stalactites have formed on
the dripping ceilings of what once were quarries for the limestone
that built Paris, most of them worked in the Middle Ages.
   During World War II, the catacombs were bunkers for the German
occupiers and hideouts for the French Resistance. They have been a
blessing to mushroom growers who harvested tons of ``champignons de
Paris'' each day from the murky gardens.
   ``It's a milieu that is such an anachronism compared with the
rest of the capital,'' said Inspector Jean-Claude Saratte, director
of police operations in the catacombs.
   It has been against the law to go underground since 1955 because
of risks both to travelers and the city's foundations, but Saratte
said: ``It's an adventure ... so everyone goes down, from sons of
Cabinet ministers to little punks.''
   Quarries of Lutecian limestone running under southern Paris,
just a corner of the 188 miles of accessible catacombs, are
assigned to the dead. The galleries are lined with the skulls and
other bones of 6 million people, some guillotined in the French
Revolution but most merely overflow from the crowded cemeteries of
Paris.
   Anne-Marie Leparmentier, a geologist with the General Inspection
of the Quarries, the city agency in charge since the 18th century,
said a ``reserve'' of bones is kept in other sections of the
quarries, but ``sometimes a skull disappears'' now that the
cataphiles have come.
   People have had regular access since the last century to the
bone caverns at the Place Denfert-Rochereau in southern Paris and
regular tours are conducted. The rest of the catacombs are reached
by manhole, under cover of darkness, down a steel ladder to another
world.
   Going underground became a fad more than a decade ago when
students of the Ecole Nationale des Mines nearly made it a ritual.
   ``We ended up spending days finding people lost inside,''
Saratte said, so all but eight of about 300 accesses to the
catacombs have been soldered shut.
   The quarries are the lowest level of subterranean Paris, which
also is honeycombed with subway lines and 1,313 miles of navigable
sewers. The vast underworld inspired Victor Hugo, and later Gaston
Leroux, whose ``Phantom of the Opera'' hid out in ``that infernal
underground maze.''
   Around one corner is a bath carved into the rock by quarry
workers centuries ago, around the next an open well that may
descend to the center of Earth. Around still another, ``Lost in the
catas. Help!'' is scrawled on the wall.
   Some writings reek of threat or foreboding: ``This is the domain
of the Klan,'' ``Avenue of the Black Mass,'' ``I'm Dead.''
   A shuffling sound comes from a corridor nearby. The path forks
and the swamp route beckons. Travelers slosh through the ancient
mud of Lutecia, as Paris was called in Roman times.
   Eras collide in the catacombs.
   Punks, skinheads and weekend revelers hold all-night seances. In
Room Z, a large, confusing, amorphous cavity reached by slithering
on the stomach through a narrow tunnel, the walls are scrolls of
obscenities, swastikas and death wails.
   Subterranean Paris is ``a very particular little world, a little
planet all its own'' where groups of regulars establish zones of
influence, said Saratte, the police inspector.
   Philip, who uses only his first name, said: ``This world is
divided into two races, the tourists and the cataphiles. The
tourists are a hated race. ... You have to do everything to chase
them out.''
   ``Actually, it is a rather hostile milieu'' where ``criminals
don't think of hiding out, said Michel Laroche, another geologist
for the city quarries agency.
   Since the beginning, the quarries of Paris have attracted those
either in hiding or in search of the celestial or the damned.
   St. Denis, patron saint of France, said Mass in the quarries
during the Christian persecution, according to Simon Lacordaire's
book ``The Secret History of Subterranean Paris.''
   Some 13th century bandits hid under the Chateau de Vauvert,
replaced long ago by the Luxembourg Gardens, Lacordaire said.
Sorcerers used the quarries for black masses, especially during the
1348 plague that filled the Paris cemeteries and caused the living
to search for solace in the occult.
   In the last century, merchants used the catacombs to smuggle
untaxed black-market goods to clients.
   Official concern now centers on preserving the natural beauty of
the quarries and fears that unauthorized travelers will harm the
city foundations.
   ``There have always been cataphiles, but perhaps in the past
they were more respectful,'' Laroche said. ``It is not a sacred
place, but it is our patrimony.''
   Over-ambitious excavations weakened the subterranean
infrastructure. There were reports a century ago of the earth
swallowing homes on the Boulevard St. Michel and neighboring
streets. Laroche said the last fatal accident was a 1961 cave-in at
Clamart, a southern suburb, that killed 20 people.
   Authorities began mapping and reinforcing the quarries in the
mid-18th century and do so today when the need arises. Quarrying
has been prohibited since 1788.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unimpressed with sweeping Soviet
reform and demands for change at home, Czechoslovakia's Communist
leaders are holding firm to policies pursued since 1968, when
``Prague Spring'' reforms were crushed.
   Tough police reaction to a mass protest in Prague on Friday and
to a demonstration in August signaled that authorities will not
tolerate public expressions of a desire for more freedom.
   For the thousands of peaceful protesters, the mass rallies could
strengthen their resolve in demanding a more democratic society.
   The next public show of support for such demands is likely to
come on International Human Rights Day on Dec. 10. A demonstration
called that day last year by the Charter 77 human rights movement
attracted a few thousand people.
   Czechoslovakia was an independent democracy for 20 years before
World War II and has a long tradition of civil movements predating
independence in 1918.
   The 70th anniversary of that independence was the occasion for
Friday's rally in Wenceslas Square, 24 hours after the authorities
organized their own mass celebration of the anniversary for the
first time in four decades of Communist rule.
   The two events were sharply contrasting, with the official rally
seeming ritualized and the banned independent gathering appearing a
more genuine expression of national sentiment, dissident filmmaker
Stanislav Milota noted in an interview.
   ``The government, at their rally, didn't sing the national
anthem, which was played by an Interior Ministry band and sung by
an Interior Ministry choir'' and not taken up by the organized,
massed crowd, Milota noted.
   By contrast, on Friday, thousands sang the national anthem with
great feeling before riot police with truncheons marched down the
square toward a core of hundreds of protesters who stood their
ground.
   The authorities have made clear they will seek no contact with
such people or unofficial groups, as Communist officials
tentatively have in neighboring Hungary.
   ``There can be no dialogue here,'' Prague Communist party chief
Miroslav Stepan told Thursday's official rally.
   At 43, Stepan, a member of the ruling Politburo, is one of a new
generation of Communist leaders slowly rising into the ruling elite
in a reshuffle by Milos Jakes, who took over as party chief from
Gustav Husak in December.
   Czechoslovaks had few expectations of reform from Jakes, who
oversaw the purge of an estimated half million Communists from the
party after August 1968, when Soviet and Warsaw Pact tanks put an
end to the ``Prague Spring'' reform of Husak's predecessor,
Alexander Dubcek.
   A reshuffle this month confirmed Jakes and his allies do not
intend to follow Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev into
sweeping economic or political reforms.
   The leading proponent of change in the top elite, Lubomir
Strougal, lost his Politburo seat and his post as premier.
   According to a Czechoslovak source, his replacement, Ladislav
Adamec, was one of a group of party members who backed Soviet
criticism of Dubcek before the 1968 invasion.
   The reshuffle also saw the first professional policeman named
Interior Minister. Frantisek Kincl, who had overall responsibility
for Friday's tough police action and the strict security in force
for days beforehand, is a former police chief in northern and
central Moravia, two areas known as the toughest on dissidents.
   The police action and detention of at least 85 dissidents in one
of the biggest pre-emptive crackdowns nationwide in years stood in
stark contrast to Soviet policy as presented a few days earlier by
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   He announced that all Soviet political prisoners would be freed
by the end of the year.
   Other Western nations greeted that announcement with skepticism.
   But recent Soviet policy does contrast with the trend in
Czechoslovakia toward what one Prague resident summed up as
``retrenchment.''
   The dissident community, meanwhile, is inching forward to more
overt political activity.
   Charter 77 has been primarily a human rights movement, a loose
association of an estimated 1,300 signatories who issue documents
on Czechoslovak society and history and include former Communist
Party members who still believe in Socialism and many intellectuals
who do not.
   Earlier this month, several leading Chartists, including banned
playwright Vaclav Havel, joined a new Movement for Civil Freedom,
which has formulated 11 demands for a multiparty democracy and a
largely denationalized economy.

<DATELINE>HERAT, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the pink-tinged sunset fades over
ruins of bombed-out houses, and kerosene lanterns start twinkling
through the darkness, the gunfire begins.
   It lasts until sunrise, to be followed intermittently through
the day by the more distant boom of rockets aimed at the city.
   Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city with a population of
106,000, is one of the cities the Moscow-backed government
considers ``safe'' because Soviet troops are still present.
   The government professes to be able to defend the city against
U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or Islamic
holy warriors, even after the Soviet pullout scheduled this winter.
   The designation ``safe'' appears to be a delusion, if not an
outright fraud.
   The guerrillas are about 12 to 13 miles from the city, according
to Juma Mohammad, provincial commander of the Sarandoy, a
paramilitary armored force considered more loyal and better-trained
than the Afghan army's rank and file.
   But the outgoing fire at night in Herat seems aimed at an enemy
much closer.
   Most of what can be heard from the balcony of a government
building on the northern edge of the city sounds no bigger than
.50-caliber _ whose range is about 1{ miles.
   The mortars used by Sarandoy troops in Herat's 14th century
citadel show signs of recent firing and are of the type that has a
maximum range of about five miles.
   In the Afghan capital of Kabul, non-Soviet bloc diplomats
predict Herat will fall quickly to the mujahedeen after Soviet
troops pull out in accordance with a U.N.-mediated accord. The
withdrawal must be completed by Feb. 15.
   But Soviet troops left Kandahar this past summer and the
mujahedeen still have not dislodged the Afghan garrison and taken
that city, the largest in the country after Kabul, the capital.
   Rockets also land in Kabul several times a week, sometimes by
the scores. Most of the time the damage is insignificant.
   But the cities are vulnerable, more to siege tactics than to any
direct military attack the mujahedeen can mount with their poorly
targeted rockets.
   The capture of Kandahar or Herat would deal a major
psychological blow to Afghanistan's Soviet-style government.
   Afghanistan's mountains afford sanctuary to the mujahedeen but
it is the cities they must capture.
   Whether they can achieve victory through direct military
attacks, the mujahedeen are in a good position to isolate the
cities from their supplies of food, fuel and military
reinforcements.
   Kabul gets a periodic taste of this when the mujahedeen cut the
roads leading to the capital, causing sugar to disappear from the
markets and doubling the prices of dwindling stocks of flour.
   Herat is even more vulnerable. Fuel comes from the Soviet Union,
a two-hour drive up the 95-mile highway to the Afghan border town
of Torghundi when the road is not blocked by winter snows or
year-round guerrillas.
   The fuel is needed not only for automobiles, which are
outnumbered in Herat by horse-drawn vehicles and bicycles, but for
heating, cooking and running the city's power plant.
   The plan provides electricity only from sundown to sunrise and
only for the few relatively prosperous neighborhoods, government
institutions and hospitals.
   Herat has never had around-the-clock electricity, not even
before the war That began a decade ago when a coup-installed
communist government took power and quickly required Soviet
assistance to survive.
   The guerrillas surrounding Herat are led by one of the
mujahedeen's ablest commanders, Ismail Khan of Jamiat-e-Islami, the
largest of the seven Pakistani-based guerrilla groups.
   Main roads and bridges around the city are now guarded by Soviet
troops.
   Sarandoy commander Mohammad said he has 4,000 men in Herat
province, 600 of them in Herat city. In addition, he said, there
are 2,000 government-paid village militiamen and 4,000 ``Defenders
of the Revolution,'' gun-toting civilians the government pays $4.75
to $7.15 a month.
   Mohammad said he had no idea how many mujahedeen were outside
the city.
   ``Their activity is too secret. It is difficult to say,'' he
said in an interview in his office where the second-story windows
were bricked up and sandbagged.

<TEXT>
   Last year, after more than 1,500
people died in the collision of a packed ferry and an oil tanker,
investigations concluded that government agencies and shipowners
habitually ignored maritime safety measures.
   Last week's sinking of the ferry Dona Marilyn during a typhoon
showed little has changed, despite sea disasters that have killed
thousands of people and left hundreds missing in the past year.
   ``Largely a seafaring people living in an archipelago, Filipinos
rightfully expect a government attentive to the needs of sea
travel,'' a Philippine Senate study said in April. ``Instead, they
find a government disorganized in its treatment of sea travel and
the shipping industry.''
   It speculated that neglect of the public safety in shipping was
probably due to the fact that most who travel by sea are poor and
cannot afford plane fares.
   The House of Representatives noted in another study that most of
the 588 ports throughout the island nation were designed primarily
to handle cargo and none has a passenger terminal.
   The reports followed separate investigations by the two chambers
into the December crash of the Dona Paz and an oil tanker. Official
reports put the death toll at about 1,700, but most estimates
placed the actual figure at more than 3,000. Only 28 survived.
   The Senate report said that despite frequent fatal accidents,
the government had done so little that when the Dona Paz sank,
``the bureaucracy had little to offer except knee-jerk reactions
and confusion.''
   Despite pledges by shipowners and authorities to enforce rules
on manifesting passengers, neither knew the precise number of
people aboard when Typhoon Ruby sank the Dona Marilyn, the sister
ship of the Dona Paz.
   The Coast Guard recorded 379 passengers and 60 crew members.
Carlos Go, president and general manager Sulpicio Lines, which
owned the ferry, said 451 passengers and 66 crewmen were on the
Dona Marilyn when it left Manila Oct. 23 for the central Philippine
port of Tacloban.
   By Sulpicio's count, at most 20 people were not listed on the
manifest. But Manila newspapers said at least 52 survivors were not
on the list.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered an investigation, saying that
among other things she wanted to know ``why they sailed despite
very bad weather.''
   Commodore Pio Garrido, commandant of the Philippine Coast Guard,
which clears commercial ships for sailing to ensure safety
regulations are followed, said Dona Marilyn was allowed to sail
because ``the weather was clear in Manila.''
   Previous warnings by the government's weather service showed the
ship's destination was in Ruby's path.
   Garrido said nothing in maritime regulations prevents a vessel
from sailing if there is bad weather at its destination.
   The investigations of the Dona Paz disaster showed virtually
everything was wrong with the shipping industry. Both laid most of
the blame on government neglect and apathy.
   Both reports said that not only was there a shortage of ships,
but communications equipment and navigational aids were obsolete
and personnel poorly trained. In addition, maritime safety
regulations could not be enforced because of corruption and
overlapping regulatory agencies, the reports said.
   The reports noted that up to seven agencies were overseeing the
shipping industry so that responsibility could easily be passed
from one to the other. It said corruption was such that operators
could obtain lincenses for even the most unseaworthy vessels by
bribing licensing officials.
   The Senate expressed surprise that despite the country's heavy
dependence on water transport, only a total of $150 million had
been invested in all aspects of the shipping industry.
   It cited figures from the Maritime Industry Authority showing
that in 1986 the country had 3,000 vessels ``of different sizes,
configurations and uses,'' which moved a total of 16 million
passengers and 39.6 million tons of cargo.
   It said the average annual maritime death toll of 152 between
1980-87 was already bad enough before the Dona Paz disaster raised
it to 508 per annum. The figure does not include hundreds of
accidents involving unregistered outriggers in rural areas.
   Despite Mrs. Aquino's promise of an investigation, the
Philippine press has been skeptical that improvements will be made.
   ``After every sea disaster, there is usually a lot of talk about
reforms in the shipping and maritime industry,'' wrote The
Philippine Star columnist Art Borjal. ``But after all is said and
done, nothing much really happens. And when another sea tragedy
takes place, the vicious cycle is repeated.''

<TEXT>
   Prince Charles took on the architectural
establishment in his own television documentary and gained a
powerful vote of confidence from ordinary citizens, newspapers, and
even some architects.
   A newspaper survey showed that more than 75 percent of Britons
agreed with the prince's views that many architects and developers
ignore people's wishes and build ugly, characterless buildings that
are unpleasant to live in.
   However, Bill Rodgers, director general of The Royal Institute
of British Architects, responded Sunday that ``there is too much
hypocrisy ... and we are not going to allow architects to be made
scapegoats.''
   Charles' maiden venture into television writing and performing
was an outspoken and often humorous return to the subject of modern
architecture, which he has discussed publicly for several years. He
has angered leading architects and raised complaints that a member
of the royal family has no business publicizing such views.
   With 75 minutes of uninterrupted television time on the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Friday night, Charles took a more positive
approach, showing viewers new buildings and developments he admired.
   But his criticism of others was severe.
   Glancing at a low, stark-white structure among Victorian
buildings at the edge of the River Thames, Charles commented:
``That's redolent of a word processor to me, and I don't see that
people particularly want to live looking at a word processor.''
   The Sunday Telegraph newspaper called the show a tour de force
that established the 39-year-old heir to the throne as a ``great
communicator.'' The Observer said it was admirable, and Sunday
Times columnist Simon Jenkins wished Charles luck in a ``genuinely
popular crusade.''
   Other Britons seemed to agree.
   ``He follows what the ordinary man in the street believes, I
think, about London: it is being drowned out by skyscrapers,'' said
an unidentified woman in a TV interview Saturday.
   In its poll by Telephone Surveys Ltd., the Sunday Express said
75.5 percent of 1,000 people in a nationally representative sample
agreed with Charles.
   Almost 88 percent thought it right for members of the royal
family to speak out on such issues. No margin of error was given.
   Denys Lasdun, architect of the concrete National Theater, was
asked by a BBC interviewer whether the prince should voice his
opinions in public.
   ``Of course he should ... so should anybody, it's a public
art,'' Lasdun said. ``But because everyone shoots their mouth off,
it doesn't mean ... they talk sense.''
   Charles called Lasdun's creation ``a clever way of building a
nuclear power station in the middle of London without anyone
objecting.''
   He called a projected London development by Peter Palumbo
``rather like a 1930s wireless (radio).''
   ``I can only say, `God bless the Prince of Wales, and God save
us from his architectural judgment,''' responded Palumbo, new
chairman of the Arts Council, which allocates state funds to
Britain's arts.
   Max Hutchinson, president-elect of the Royal Institute of
British Architects, defended the latest generation of architects.
He said they have ``no greater love than the prince for much of
what happened 20 or more years ago.''
   Conservative Party lawmaker Sydney Chapman, the only architect
in the House of Commons, backed Charles in his attack on ``ugly,
multi-story slabs of concrete.'' But the legislator said they were
principally the fault of politicians who rushed to rebuild cities
damaged in World War II.
   In its page-one editorial, The Sunday Telegraph said Charles
could become a major television personality.
   ``It will only take a few more charismatic performances like
last week's for him to hold the nation in the palm of his hand,''
the newspaper said.

an audience of more than 60,000 with a two-hour concert of songs
from his days with the Rolling Stones and his solo career.
   Jagger, appearing Sunday at the nation's biggest soccer stadium,
sang at least 22 songs, including the Stones' ``Honky Tonk Woman,''
and ``I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)'' and his own ``Just Another

   With the great pyramids of
Teotihuacan as a backdrop, Spanish tenor Placido Domingo led the
premier of ``Aztec Songs,'' a choral symphony written in a
500-year-old Indian language.
   ``Aztec Songs'' is based on the poetry of Nezahualcoyotl, a
ruler of the Nahuatl tribe who died in 1472.
   The songs were performed Saturday in Nahuatl, an ancient Mexican
tongue that gave the world the word for chocolate. Thousands of
people in Mexico still speak Nahuatl and there are Nahuatl poets
still writing today.
   Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin conducted the symphony with a
baton of obsidian, the gleaming black volcanic rock fashioned into
works of art by Mexico's pre-Colombian peoples, in an icy wind
before an estimated 10,000 people at the foot of the Pyramid of the
Moon.
   The audience greeted Domingo, who performed with a cold, with an
especially warm round of applause. The tenor has relatives in
Mexico and his efforts to help it recover from the devasting 1985
earthquake has endeared him to Mexicans.
   The performance was part of a campaign to raise $300,000 to
preserve Teotihuacan, 25 miles north of Mexico City.

   The flu forced pop star Michael Jackson to
cancel three concerts here this week, his publicist says.
   The decision to cancel the shows scheduled for today, Tuesday
and Wednesday at the Tacoma Dome was made on the advice of
Jackson's physician and after consultation with the singer's
manager, Frank DiLeo, publicist Michael Mitchell said Sunday.

   Leonard Nimoy, who went from playing Mr. Spock
on ``Star Trek'' to directing hit movies, says it's good to be just
an actor again _ and Mr. Spock at that.
   ``I was fantasizing about this when I was making `The Good
Mother,''' Nimoy told The New York Times during filming of ``Star
Trek V.'' ``The actor comes to work and says, `Where's the coffee?
What time is lunch? Why are you keeping me waiting?'''
   Co-star William Shatner, Nimoy's ``Star Trek'' shipmate as
Captain Kirk, is the director of ``Star Trek V.''
   Nimoy directed ``Star Trek III'' and the popular ``Star Trek
IV'' before returning to Earth to make the hit ``Three Men and a
Baby.'' His latest film, ``The Good Mother'' starring Diane Keaton
and Jason Robards, opens this week.
   ``I feel like I've been struck by lightning,'' Nimoy said in the
interview published Sunday. ``But I feel like I've been standing
out in a rainstorm for quite a while and I finally got hit.''

   Tom Rettig, who was Lassie's best friend as farm
boy Jeff Miller on TV's most famous dog show, says he discovered
that life outside of show business has its hazards.
   Rettig, who played Jeff from 1954 to 1957, dropped out of show
biz at age 15.
   ``I wanted to be a real kid and see what the real world was
like,'' he said in an interview in this week's People magazine.
   After high school, Rettig tried odd jobs and tried to go back
into acting, but didn't have much success. ``I went into the most
painful period of my life,'' he said. ``I considered suicide every
day.''
   In 1971, he was arrested for growing marijuana. Three years
later, he was jailed on another drug charge, and his wife left him
with their two boys. The latter conviction was overturned in 1979.
   Rettig's story had a happy ending. Today, he lives in Marina del
Rey, Calif., and owns computer software company.
   ``I'm at the happiest place I've ever been,'' he told People.
``I'm happy with myself, my career and my life.''

   Professional basketball superstar Michael Jordan
says he plans to take more time out to smell the flowers.
   ``Next year, I plan to cut down on my endorsements and personal
appearances,'' the Chicago Bulls guard said recently. ``I want to
have more time for myself.
   ``At the same time, I don't want to isolate myself from people.
I don't have fences around my house or guards standing in front of
it. No bodyguards with me when I go out.''
   Although basketball has made him a millionaire, Jordan said he
enjoyed it more when he was a child in North Carolina.
   ``Then, there was no business surrounding it,'' he said. ``No
crowds following your every step. The game was cut down to its bare
basic. It was pure fun, something everybody in the neighborhood
just loved to do.
   ``Now, there is too much pressure on me. Not just in terms of
how you play the game, but how you are perceived away from the
game.''

<HEAD>No Pre-Election Indictments in Pentagon Fraud Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor in a massive defense
contracting probe says the complexity of the case _ not politics _
will delay indictments until after the Nov. 8 election.
   Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, Va., who is
coordinating the multistate investigation, also said indictments
could continue for a year as a result of a probe into the
$150-billion-a-year Defense Department purchasing system.
   A federal grand jury resumes meeting Nov. 15, so indictments
could come then, which would be about five months after the FBI
revealed the investigation by searching more than 40 premises
across the country.
   ``I am very optimistic on November indictments,'' Hudson said.
Information about the case has been scarce because prosecutors have
sealed most search warrants and affidavits.
   The investigation centers on whether private consultants, many
of them former Pentagon employees, paid bribes to Defense
Department officials for inside information about contracts,
chiefly within the Navy.
   Hudson, a Republican, denied any suggestion that indictments
were slowed so that Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis could not make them an issue in his campaign against Vice
President George Bush.
   ``Nothing would have given me greater pleasure than to hand down
indictments in the first part of October,'' Hudson said in an
interview.
   But the prosecutor said the case has been ``administratively
complex'' with attorneys forced to examine about 700,000 documents
and listen to ``thousands and thousands of tapes of two years of
telephone interceptions.''
   Federal and defense sources also indicate Hudson's staff has
been kept waiting for answers from some potential defendants who
have been offered plea bargains.
   Adding to the task was the time-consuming process of gathering
financial evidence from foreign bank accounts, which Hudson
described as an ``always delicate issue.''
   Hudson said there were good reasons for thoroughness, including
the ``high national visibility'' of the case, and the propensity
for judges in Virginia to schedule trials shortly after indictments
are returned.
   ``I will not present this indictment until we are ready for
trial, and we feel we will be ready ... within the next month,'' he
said. As the case evolves, indictments and trials could be held in
other cities, sources said.
   Hudson did not discuss charges that could be filed. But the use
of Internal Revenue Service agents on the case suggests that tax
charges may be contemplated in addition to the more obvious counts
of theft of government property, bribery, fraud and conspiracy to
defraud the government.
   Fifteen attorneys, some of them working 12-hour days and
weekends, plus 75 federal agents from the FBI, the Naval
Investigative Service and the IRS have been assigned to the case,
which Hudson called, ``the largest case ever handled in the eastern
district of Virginia.''
   Hudson refused to say how many indictments he expected to be
returned initially, but noted that courtroom space generally
confines the number to less than 12.
   Though Hudson declined to name the targets of the investigation,
he did not rule out members of Congress.
   ``All individuals that may have been engaged in wrongdoing or
committed a criminal act in connection with the defense procurement
process will be scrutinized and prosecuted if appropriate,'' he
said.
   Hudson disputed reports that he had told members of Congress
during the summer that none was a target. ``I never made such a
statement,'' he said.
   ``I told the members of the House of Representatives that no
member of Congress had been the subject of electronic surveillance,
had received a subpoena to testify in front of the grand jury at
that time or had been the subject of a search warrant,'' he said.
   Court papers filed in Brooklyn, N.Y., indicate prosecutors are
looking at allegations that campaign contributions were extorted.
   Raids in New York came at the business of James Kane, who set up
the Long Island Aerospace Political Action Committee to make
contributions that might help area defense contractors, and at the
home of Dennis Mitchell, a Unisys Corp. official identified as
turning over contributions to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., who sits on
the House Armed Services Committee. Dyson has denied any wrongdoing.
   The name of another committee member, Rep. Bill Chappell Jr.,
has also surfaced in connection with the probe. Chappell says he
has done nothing wrong.
   Among those whose names have been linked to the investigation
are five Pentagon officials, including James Gaines, deputy
assistant Navy secretary for acquisition and management; Melvyn
Paisley, a consultant who was assistant secretary of the Navy for
research, engineering and systems before leaving government in
1987, and William Galvin, another defense consultant.

<HEAD>USDA Economist Predicts Bumper Crops Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's drought is not likely to be
repeated in 1989, and U.S. farmers probably will harvest bumper
crops of wheat, corn and soybeans, according to an Agriculture
Department economist.
   Corn production, for example, could nearly double from this
year's drought-riddled yield.
   But James Cole of the department's Economic Research Service
warned that a backlog of demand will siphon off most of the 1989
crop increases without allowing the United States to rebuild its
stockpiles significantly.
   ``Production of all commodities almost certainly will be much
greater next year, but consumption of wheat, corn and soybeans also
will remain high, resulting in only limited increases in stocks
during 1989-90,'' Cole said.
   The odds are good for such a harvest improvement in 1989, he
said. Since 1970, drought has shriveled U.S. crops five times _
1970, 1974, 1980, 1983 and 1988 _ and in each case harvest yields
were up significantly the following year.
   According to Cole's analysis, which was prepared for the
November issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, 1989 wheat
production may rebound to about 2.5 billion bushels from 1.8
billion bushels this year; corn to 7.5 billion to 8 billion bushels
from 4.4 billion in 1988; and soybeans to almost 2 billion bushels
from this year's harvest of 1.5 billion.
   Cole said the larger crops of 1989 ``will be used to sustain
growing consumption'' by domestic and foreign users. Therefore, he
added, inventories ``may rise only slightly'' by the end of the
1989-90 crop year.
   ``The real impact of the drought _ markedly reduced stocks _
will remain for some time to come,'' Cole said. ``Some rebuilding
of inventories that had been severely depleted in 1988-89 is
expected, but gains will be small. Larger increases, if desired,
will take more time.''
   Despite the odds that the 1988 drought will not be repeated next
year, the possibility still exists, no matter how unsavory the
subject is for USDA officials.
   Lester Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute, a non-profit
research organization based in Washington, recently said that
another U.S. drought in 1989 would trigger a ``desperate scramble''
by needy countries for dwindling grain supplies.
   Cole explained further about drought's track record in the
United States and how it backs up his contention that 1989 may be a
bumper crop year.
   ``Unlike other countries, the United States has not had
back-to-back droughts in at least 75 years,'' he said. ``The Soviet
Union recently endured as many as four successive years of drought.
U.S. weather history and prospects give little reason to believe
that crop yields will not rebound next year.''
   Moreover, he said, rainfall in September and October has helped
replenish badly depleted soil moisture in parts of the corn and
soybean belts, and across the Southeast. Long-term forecasts call
for average or slightly above-average chances for normal
precipitation this fall.
   ``Even so, most of the upper Midwest and Southeast still require
as much as 6 to 10 inches of rainfall this fall and winter to
restore soil moisture to more normal levels,'' Cole said.
``Temperatures are likely to be somewhat higher than normal.''
   Some other reasons cited by Cole for expecting 1989 crop
production to rise sharply:
   _The USDA has used provisions of the 1985 farm law to reduce the
amount of land farmers must idle in order to qualify for price
supports and other program benefits, including ``deficiency''
payments, or direct subsidies.
   For 1989, as an example, only 10 percent of a farmer's feed
grain base acreage will have to be set aside, compared with 20
percent this year. Wheat farmers also will have to idle only 10
percent instead of 27.5 percent for 1988.
   _The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, which provides drought aid
to stricken farmers, also permits USDA to let farmers plant
soybeans or sunflowers on corn acres without losing acreage credit
for future program calculations.
   Although 1989 soybean plantings are likely to expand less than
either wheat or corn, production is expected to rise substantially.
   Soybean acreage in the South has been declining for several
years as farmers returned land to fallow or other uses. Recovery
could begin in 1989, but it will take sustained higher prices to
boost the South's soybean acreage to levels of the late 1970s, when
prices were high and exports boomed.
   ``Consumption of wheat, corn and soybeans is expected to
increase in 1989-90,'' Cole said. ``Domestic food, seed and
industrial uses likely will be near present levels. However, global
grain and oilseed use probably will increase slightly.''
   Cole added: ``Export growth will be spurred further by increased
demand from developing countries, as the value of the dollar
remains relatively low. Price declines accompanying next year's
harvest will make it easier for importing nations to maintain or
expand purchases in 1989-90.''

<HEAD>Could the Marbled Murrelet Be a Red Herring?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the marbled murrelet turns out to be an
endangered bird, it may endanger loggers' plans to take timber from
some of the oldest forests in North America.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, in a little-noticed decision
published in the Federal Register, agreed to consider listing the
marbled murrelet as an endangered species.
   The agency found that a National Audubon Society petition for
listing the bird ``presented substantial information indicating
that the requested action may be warranted.''
   Not much is known about the marbled murrelet, a robin-sized
seabird that seems to swim better than it walks or flies. But
scientists are convinced the bird nests almost exclusively in the
old-growth timber that towers over the coastal regions of the
Northwest _ some of the oldest forests in North America.
   Listing the bird as endangered or threatened could result in a
ban on cutting trees that are prized by the timber industry for
their top-quality logs and premium market price.
   Timber industry officials accuse environmentalists of using the
marbled murrelet to attempt a ``backdoor'' prohibition against
old-growth timber harvesting on public lands.
   ``It sounds like a red herring,'' said Jay Goldstein, a
spokesman for the Washington Forest Protection Association which
includes among its members some of the largest forest-products
companies in the Northwest.
   ``We need to decide what to do and get on with it,'' said
Goldstein. ``But let's not play games and use soft little birds to
defraud the process. These never-ending tactics aimed at foiling
the process are irresponsible.''
   Environmentalists don't deny that they are waging a battle to
halt the cutting of old-growth timber, but add that the marbled
murrelet is worthy of protection in its own right.
   ``We are going to make the survival of the ancient forest a
national issue,'' said Brock Evans, an Audubon Society vice
president. ``This is not just a problem for the Northwest. Everyone
owns these forests. It's like saying the Grand Canyon only belongs
to the people of Arizona.''
   Caught in the middle is the Fish and Wildlife Service, which
recently declared that another bird that nests in old-growth
timber, the spotted owl, wasn't worthy of listing as endangered or
threatened. That decision is now being reviewed in a lawsuit
brought in federal court in Portland, Ore.
   ``What we have to answer is how important is old growth to the
marbled murrelet,'' said Jim Bottroff, a Fish and Wildlife
biologist based in Portland.
   The Audubon Society believes that the bird could eventually
become extinct if logging of the old-growth forest continues.
   According to biologists' estimates, only 3,400 breeding pairs of
marbled murrelets remain in Washington state, maybe 2,400 breeding
pairs in Oregon and less than 1,000 in Northern California.
   Estimates for Alaska range up to 50,000 breeding pairs and the
bird is also found in Western Canada.
   Jim Pissot, an Audubon Society specialist, said that since the
turn of the century people have been trying to discover where the
marbled murrelet nests.
   ``Now we know or think we know: 150 feet up on the thick
branches of old-growth trees,'' said Pissot. ``They are very
dependent on old growth.''
   Environmentalists believe that more than 160 species may be
dependent for survival on old-growth forests.
   ``The spotted owl and the marbled murrelet are just the tip of
the iceberg,'' said Evans. ``They dramatize what is at stake.''
   The U.S. Forest Service has estimated that about 7.5 million
acres of old growth remains in the Northwest with more than 80
percent of it on national forest lands.
   Plans call for cutting about half of that total over the next 50
years and Forest Service officials have warned that unless it is
cut the region's timber industry could collapse.
   Environmentalists say the Forest Service estimates are grossly
inflated and even include trees that were destroyed by the 1980
eruption of Mount St. Helens.
   They also say that the old growth is being cut at the rate of
more than 170 acres a day _ the equivalent of roughly 129 football
fields.
   Congress asked the Forest Service to survey the remaining old
growth and to come up with a common definition for an ancient tree.
   A Forest Service task force earlier defined old-growth trees as
being at least 200 years old and almost three feet in diameter.
   Environmentalists say that definition is too narrow and that
officials also should take into account how many of the trees are
in a given area and whether it has the characteristics of a mature
forest.

<HEAD>Savings Seen in Fighting Farm Pests with Other Insects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical pesticides used to kill crop-damaging
bugs too often destroy the pests' natural predators as well, says a
group promoting use of the insect world's ``good guys'' to protect
food supplies.
   The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research,
which holds its annual meeting here next week, has compiled a
number of examples from around the world to bolster its position.
   It says, for instance, that the island republic of Indonesia
alone could save up to $100 million a year by cutting down on
chemical pesticides and using other bugs to fight the ones that
hurt the rice crop.
   The group represents 13 international research centers around
the world, including those responsible for starting the ``green
revolution'' in maize and other crops. They are trying to obtain
$23.8 million for a five-year biological fight against pests.
   Damage by pests to cassava, on which 200 million Africans
depend, has been estimated at $2 billion a year. Americans know
cassava best as tapioca, and use it occasionally in puddings. In
Africa and other Third World areas it is a staple food.
   One economist calculated that a little wasp brought from
Paraguay saved over $400 million worth of cassava in Africa last
year by eating large quantities of mealybugs, the chief culprit in
the losses.
   Richard B. Norgaard, who teaches farm economics at the
University of California, Berkeley, wrote that the wasp program
saved farmers $149 for every dollar spent on it.
   Merle Shepard used to be the top man on insects of the
International Rice Research Institute at Los Banos, in the
Philippines. He now teaches about useful and harmful insects at
Clemson University in Clemson, S.C.
   ``There are about 800 species of `good guys' in the field,'' he
said. ``In most cases they outnumber the `bad guys' five to three.''
   A major enemy of the rice plant is the brown planthopper. One
wolf spider will kill 20 to 30 of them in a day, saving an
estimated $3 worth of rice a season.
   The trick is to find the best bugs, test them, release them and
get them established where they can do most good.
   Shepard told reporters that chemical pesticides can hurt farming
as well as help, by killing the useful as well as the harmful
insects. A study on Indonesia earlier this year by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said:
   ``Only when these predators were killed by unnecessary
insecticide treatments did the brown planthopper escape natural
control and become a serious pest.''
   Shepard said some pesticides must be used, but that they can be
eliminated 70 percent to 90 percent of the time.
   The use of biological methods goes back to the ancient Chinese,
who set predatory ants against some insects that attacked citrus
fruit. The most recent list of such attempts, compiled in 1976,
reports 327 successes.
   Hans Herren is a Swiss who works in the International Institute
of Tropical Agriculture at Ibadan, Nigeria. He said U.N. figures
show that 40,000 Third World farmers are killed and 150,000 are
injured every year from the use of pesticides.
   A study last year by the U.S. National Research Council reported
several hundred deaths from pesticides a year in this country
during the 1970s. It estimated that tens of thousands of people
fell ill because of the chemicals.
   The international research group says the use of bugs, birds and
microbes as well as chemicals to help fight pests can be cheaper,
healthier and more effective than only spraying with pesticides.
But it is also a lot more trouble, which may be one reason it has
not caught on more in richer countries.
   ``Farmers don't like counting bugs,'' Shepard said.

   The oldest and largest trade group of savings
institutions opened its annual convention today, intent on
persuading Congress to help the ailing industry with a
multibillion-dollar bailout and preserve it as a system separate
from commercial banks.
   The nation's 3,048 savings institutions lost $7.5 billion in the
first six months of this year and losses almost surely will top
last year's post-Depression record of $7.8 billion.
   An estimated 4,050 delegates and spouses to the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions' 96th annual convention have gathered in the
palm-ringed luxury hotels along Waikiki Beach to map strategy for
1989, when Congress likely will make decisions affecting the
industry for years to come.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates the industry,
estimates the cost of restoring all S&Ls to solvency at $45 billion
to $50 billion, but private analysts put the price tag as high as
$100 billion.
   Bank board chairman M. Danny Wall, scheduled to address the
convention on Thursday, said his agency will have enough money to
do the job, but only if thrift institutions are charged a special
assessment for deposit insurance for the next 30 years.
   S&Ls say they can't afford it and are looking to Congress to
come up with the additional money.
   ``It's a 30-year mortgage we just flat out can't handle,'' said
Theo H. Pitt Jr., chairman of Pioneer Savings Bank in Rocky Mount,
N.C., and outgoing chairman of the industry group.
   The bank board this year has shut down more than 135
institutions or merged them with stronger partners, but at midyear,
497 insolvent institutions were still open. Another 408 were
solvent but losing money.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., financed by
assessments on the industry, was set up to insure deposits in S&Ls
but it has been weakened by the flurry of failures. S&Ls already
pay more than twice as much for deposit insurance as commercial
banks _ $2.08 cents per $1,000 of deposits for S&Ls compared with
83 cents for banks.
   Pitt contends that continuing the extra assessment, originally
scheduled to be phased out in three years, would push otherwise
profitable institutions into insolvency, creating an ever-enlarging
problem.
   So far this year, the extra assessment has made the difference
between profit and loss for 69 institutions, he said.
   ``Clearly there is a limit to what the solvent institutions can
do,'' he said.
   Congress, when it decides how to pay the bill, whether through a
direct appropriation from the Treasury or through some sort of
taxpayer-backed guarantee, will almost certainly include measures
aimed at preventing the problem from recurring.
   Although much of the industry's problems are concentrated in
depressed oil-producing states in the Southwest, they have been
magnified in Texas, California and Florida by lax state regulation
that permitted thrift institutions to make risky investments far
removed from traditional home mortgage lending.
   Many in the industry had pushed for permission to diversify in
the early 1980s when soaring interest rates made it impossible for
thrifts to make money on their old, fixed-rate mortgages. The
argument was that a greater range of activities would help
institutions pull themselves out of the hole.
   As it turned out, Pitt said, the institutions that strayed most
from traditional mortgage lending earned the least.
   ``The ones that have gotten into trouble were the ones who took
the most advantage of the new powers,'' he said.
   Rep. Gerald Kleczka, D-Wis., and other members of Congress say
that after all the insolvent S&Ls are closed or merged with
stronger partners, the entire S&L system should be merged with the
commercial bank system.
   But Pitt says American home buyers need a separate S&L system.
   A study by the U.S. League this summer showed that thrifts and
mortgage banking companies owned by thrifts provided 54 percent of
the country's residential mortgages last year.
   ``I believe Congress is beginning to recognize that we haven't
abandoned our traditional role,'' Pitt said. ``If we don't do it,
you're going to have to reinvent the system.
   He said the league will be recommending regulatory changes in
what he called a ``never again scenario.'' Among the likely
recommendations, he said, would be stricter limits on direct
investment in commercial real estate projects and on the amount
that can be loaned to a single customer.

   A tractor-trailer driver ran at least
nine vehicles off the road Sunday, killing one driver, and wounded
an officer in a violence spree that stretched 70 miles, police said.
   A 30-year-old man was arrested, but no charges had been filed as
of late Sunday, authorities said.
   The series of events on Interstate 10 in West Texas lasted less
than an hour, said David Wells, a Department of Public Safety
spokesman.
   They began near Van Horn, about 100 miles southeast of El Paso,
when authorities received reports of cars being run off the road by
a westbound semi-tractor-trailer, said DPS trooper Bob Newman.
   Thirty miles west of Van Horn, the man rammed a car driven by
Sharon Marie Agutter, 48, of El Paso, Newman said. She later was
found dead in her flipped car on the side of the interstate, said
Wells.
   Several miles west, a man driving a recreational vehicle pulling
a trailer was rammed from behind and run off the road. The driver
of the RV was uninjured and followed the trucker, Newman said.
   A Hudspeth County constable and a Border Patrol agent who heard
about the incident on their police radio pulled over and waited for
the trucker. When he drove by, the two officers gave chase.
   The officers pulled the trucker over near Fort Hancock. When
Constable Sonny Hillin got out of the patrol car, the driver tried
to pin him against the vehicle, Newman said. Hillin was able to
scramble away, get back into the car and drive it in front of the
truck to stop it.
   When Hillin got out of his car again, the truck driver shot two
times through his own windshield and hit the officer once, Newman
said. He said the trucker then fired at the trailing recreational
vehicle, but no one was injured. The truck driver then drove off a
second time.
   The driver finally stopped his vehicle a half-mile west of Fort
Hancock. He offered no resistance, Newman said.
   Hillin was taken to Vista Hills Medical Center in El Paso, where
he was in stable condition with a gunshot wound to the neck, a
nursing supervisor said late Sunday.

<HEAD>Come Tuesday, They're Off To Wall Street _ May the Best Investor
Win</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starting Tuesday, about 15,000 students
nationwide will play a Wall Street board game come to life,
complete with a toll-free number to make trades and a computerized
network with up-to-the-minute stock prices.
   For the next four months, each of the students at 1,000 colleges
and universities will use $500,000 in play money to buy and sell
stocks in the first AT&T Collegiate Investment Challenge,
organizers said.
   ``My strategy right now is go for some long shots and hope they
pay off,'' said Steve Geist, a political science major at the
University of California-Berkeley and aspiring lawyer.
   Participants include students from community colleges, four-year
colleges and graduate programs.
   The student investors are expected to make 7,500 calls a day to
30 ``brokers'' at Wellesley, Mass.,-based Wall Street Games, the
educational board game the competition is based upon.
   The students are likely to opt for high-risk portfolios in hopes
of gaining the greatest growth in the shortest time, said Lisa
Nollet, marketing director for Wall Street Games.
   Although less bullish trading is more prudent in real life,
Nollet says players of the game still learn the rudiments of the
stock market and perhaps a sense of caution.
   The top finisher wins $25,000 in real money. Second place gets
$10,000. Other prizes include a trip to New York, a week in the
Bahamas, wristwatches and athletic shoes.
   Those who double their money will be made members of the
``Millionaire's Club.''

   The United States is entering into a
worldwide treaty providing reciprocal copyright protection for
American artists and writers and those of 76 other countries.
   In a ceremony in a hotel meeting room today, President Reagan
was signing legislation bringing American copyright law into
compliance with the 102-year-old Bern Convention for the Protection
of Literary and Artistic Works.
   The Senate ratified the treaty on Oct. 20, but legislation
making changes in American copyright laws was also needed before
the United States could become a full-fledged member of the
convention.
   Differences between American and other nations' copyright laws
stalled ratification for decades, but many of the obstacles were
removed when Congress enacted a sweeping overhaul of U.S. copyright
law in 1976.
   Participation in the convention will enable the United States to
have copyright relations with 24 countries with which it now has
none, officials said.
   The convention was signed in Bern on Sept. 9, 1886. It spells
out minimum copyright standards, detailing what is protected and
how long the copyright lasts. It also bars member nations from
discriminating against protected works from other member states.
   The signing ceremony was the only public event on the
president's schedule today.
   On Sunday, Reagan and his wife, Nancy, traveled from their ranch
north of Santa Barbara to receive awards from the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, an organization dedicated to the study of the Holocaust.
   In a speech accepting the center's 1988 humanitarian award, the
president said his administration has made U.S. ties with Israel
``warmer than they have ever been'' and added:
   ``We must remain strong, and we must be willing to use force
when we are under threat. This is a lesson that binds us still
closer to the state of Israel; for the fact is, a strong Israel
depends upon a strong America.''
   Reagan also announced that he will soon sign enabling
legislation passed this year to facilitate U.S. adherence to the
United Nations convention on genocide, which the Senate ratified in
1986 after a long campaign by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis. Aides
said the president is expected to sign the legislation on Thursday
in Washington.
   The award to the president was given for his efforts on behalf
of peace and his support of Israel.
   It was presented at a dinner held on the 80th birthday of Simon
Wiesenthal, who has worked with the U.S. and other governments in
locating Nazi war criminals. Wiesenthal joined the president and
others at the head table.
   The president, who left the White House last Thursday,
campaigned for the Republican ticket in Arkansas, Missouri and
California and made a foreign policy address here before spending
the weekend at the ranch.
   On Tuesday, he will resume campaigning with stops in San
Bernardino and Fullerton, Calif., and Reno, Nev. He will speak in
Milwaukee and in Berea, Ohio, before returning to the White House
on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The damage has been repaired and the
continuing aftershocks are mostly imperceptible, and some say the
great temblor that shook central Idaho and killed two children five
years ago is being forgotten.
   ``It was a beautiful day until the Earth started shaking,''
remembered Oval Caskey, mayor of the small town of Mackay. ``It
just shook everything down to the roots.''
   The quake struck near the Little River Valley town of Challis on
the morning of Oct. 28, 1983. At 7.3 on the Richter scale, it was
the nation's most powerful earthquake in nearly 20 years and one of
the country's strongest ever recorded.
   The quake visibly rolled up the valley, undulating the ground
like an ocean wave and making its shock felt as far away as
southwestern North Dakota, or more than 600 miles.
   The state's tallest mountain, 12,662-foot Borah Peak, was at the
epicenter. The quake lifted it a foot, dropped the valley to the
west 4 feet and created a 12-mile-long fault line still visible
today.
   Two school children died in the valley that's home to about
1,400 people. Damage in Challis and Mackay ran into the millions of
dollars.
   ``I was never worried about earthquakes before,'' said Mike
Gallagher, owner of Round Valley Supply in Challis. ``But every
time you feel a tremor your heart stops for a second and you wonder
if this is another big one.''
   Residents worked quickly to repair the damage, though, and the
government built a city hall in Mackay and several new schools in
the valley.
   ``They're a tough bunch,'' said Walt Weymouth, who recently
moved from Challis to northern California. ``They submerged their
feelings and simply went on with their lives.''
   Janet Franck is one of them. Her 6-year-old son, Travis, was
killed by the falling rubble along with 7-year-old Tara Leaton as
they walked to school in Challis.
   ``I'm a person who believes the past is in the past and it
should be left there,'' Mrs. Franck said. ``Bringing it back up
just opens a lot of old wounds.''
   Aftershocks have dwindled to only a few each week, and only a
fraction of them are felt beyond scientists' seismographs.
   Attitudes have lightened so much that when an aftershock has
been big enough, like last summer's 4.7 tremor, clerks in the
Custer County Courthouse have set up a betting pool for estimating
the final Richter scale reading.
   Scientists like Bob Smith of the University of Utah express
worries that information gleaned from the quake has been ignored.
   ``We can take what we've learned there now and say what would
happen if we had an equivalent earthquake in, say, Salt Lake
City,'' which lies on the Wasatch Fault.
   But, he cautioned: ``The people who are in the position to
utilize this kind of data, the land-use planners, the legislative
people ... seem to operate on short-term problems. The lessons
learned from Borah Peak don't seem to have made much of an impact
yet.''
   Idaho Disaster Services Director Darrell Waller said the state
has scheduled a major earthquake disaster exercise for next spring.
But he acknowledged that building codes haven't been revised, and
said a disaster of greater magnitude may be needed to prompt such
changes.
   ``Had that event happened and affected seriously a major city,
it would not have been so quickly forgotten,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Case Could Set Precedent for Older Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utilities nationwide are closely watching a
clean-air case involving a Wisconsin power company because it could
affect future renovation projects at hundreds of older plants
across the country.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has told Wisconsin Electric
Power Co. that it will have to meet more stringent standards for
new plants if it goes ahead with planned repairs at a coal-fired
power plant.
   The industry has long assumed that such renovation projects were
exempt from the tougher clean-air rules that apply to new plants.
EPA's ruling is the first of its kind.
   ``I think they are flat wrong,'' said Henry Nickel, chief lawyer
for the Utility Air Regulatory Group, which represents utilities.
EPA's decision, he said, contradicts current regulations.
   Bob Beck, environmental manager for the Edison Electric
Institute, trade association of the nation's private utilities,
said EPA's ruling could amount to ``a de facto acid rain program.''
   The Energy Department has taken the utilities' side, protesting
to EPA that the decision could jeopardize future power supplies, or
make them more costly. Utilities say they may simply close plants
or forgo repairs if the new-plant standards will apply.
   But David Hawkins, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said EPA ``is making the right call.''
   ``It's about time they put some life and teeth into the
requirements'' that significant renovation qualifies a plant as new.
   The plant involved is the Port Washington station in suburban
Milwaukee, whose five 80-megawatt generating units were installed
from 1935 to 1950.
   In 1984 the company discovered severe cracks in steam drums. The
following year one of the five units was taken off line and steam
pressure reduced in the other four, for an overall drop in capacity
of 40 percent.
   Now the company plans to replace the steam drums in a project
costing $71 million. Wisconsin Electric argues that this is routine
maintenance that ought to be exempt from review.
   But in an Oct. 14 letter to the company informing it of the
decision, EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said the company had told
state regulators the project was not routine, that $46 million of
the expense was a capital expenditure, that capacity had
deteriorated before 1984 for other reasons, and that other
equipment also would be replaced to help restore original capacity.
   Thomas said emissions will go back up once the plant resumes
full-power generation, and that the increase will result from a
capital rather than a maintenance expenditure.
   The argument that the utility plans only to restore original
capacity is not relevant under those circumstances, he said.
   Sulfur dioxide is the most important pollutant at issue. Formed
from sulfur in the fuel, it is transformed in the atmosphere into
sulfuric acid, leading to acid rain.
   A new plant today would be limited to 0.6 to 1.2 pounds of
sulfur per million BTUs provided by the fuel. At the same time it
would have to remove 70 percent to 90 percent of the sulfur
originally in the coal.
   Port Washington now burns coal emitting 2.5 pounds of sulfur per
million BTUs. EPA estimates that Port Washington's hourly emissions
of sulfur dioxide would increase from current levels by 69 percent
after the renovation.
   As a practical matter, the only way to prevent that increase
would be to install smokestack ``scrubbers'' _ something that
according to one industry rule of thumb could cost about $80
million at Port Washington, more than the repairs, and reduce the
plant's electrical output by 5 percent.
   Wisconsin Power is negotiating with EPA in a bid to avoid that
expense. Lisa Fox, a company spokeswoman, declined to discuss
specifics of the negotiations, though she did confirm that
fuel-switching to oil or gas is an option.
   Though U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions have been falling since the
mid-1970s, environmentalists say they would have fallen faster if
more old plants had been replaced by new plants.
   Extending the life of old plants ``wasn't even on the radar
screen'' in 1979, when the current regulations were promulgated,
said Hawkins, who was then with the EPA and helped draft the rules.
   Now, according to the Energy Department, plants more than 30
years old are expected to account for 25 percent of all
fossil-fueled generating capacity in 1990 and 90 percent in 2010.

<NOTE>Eds: LEAD prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   On the eve of a new round of peace talks, Iran and
Iraq each released 25 prisoners of war and U.N. chief Javier Perez
de Cuellar said he would promptly seek the repatriation of the
thousands that remain.
   The United Nations secretary general told reporters on arrival
Sunday that he hoped the third round of talks that begins today
would soon yield ``positive results,'' specifically on the exchange
of prisoners.
   But he has said his first target as mediator to have both sides
agree to the disengagement of forces that a U.N. report says have
remained in ``dangerous proximity'' since Aug. 20, when a truce
halted the 8-year-old war.
   The U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observers Group, which is monitoring
the cease-fire, says in the report that in some places troops are
separated by just 30 feet of no man's land.
   Perez de Cuellar said he planned to discuss the prisoner-of-war
issue this morning with the president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross and expected to meet later today with
the delegations of both sides.
   A U.N. report estimates Iran and Iraq hold a combined total of
up to 105,000 prisoners of war, though the Red Cross has registered
just 50,182 in Iran and 19,284 in Iraq.
   So far, Iran has freed 790 prisoners and Iraq 638, according to
the Red Cross.
   On Sunday, Iraq freed 25 disabled Iranian prisoners and they
were flown to Tehran, the capital of Iran, aboard a plane chartered
by the Red Cross. Iran reciprocated immediately by releasing 25
Iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight to
Baghdad, Iraq, according to Francoise Derand, a spokesman at the
Red Cross office in Geneva.
   Iraq has agreed in principle to release all prisoners and says
their freedom should not have to be worked out in the peace talks.
But Iran has said the exchange must be based on the U.N. resolution
under which the cease-fire took hold and on a plan drafted by Perez
de Cuellar.
   That plan provides for a timetable for implementing all ten
points of the cease-fire resolution, ranging from the
prisoner-of-war exchange to assessment of damages and an inquiry
into who started the war.
   Perez de Cuellar said Sunday night that he hoped the Geneva
talks would be ``if possible much more useful'' than the previous
round held in New York early this month.
   Both Iran and Iraq have not budged on the principal issue
stalemating the talks since they began in Geneva on Aug. 25:
delineation of the border between the two nations.
   Iran says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only navigable outlet to the sea.
Iraq repudiated the treaty in 1980 and demands sovereignty over the
entire waterway.
   Foreign Minister Tariz Aziz of Iraq, who heads his country's
delegation to the talks, told reporters at the airport on Sunday
that Iraq ``did not go to New York for substantial negotiations.
   ``Let us resume direct talks in Geneva where we can stay for a
while as long as the job needs,'' he said. ``Now we will negotiate
on this matter with the Iranians.''
   He said Iran, whose delegation is headed by Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, is to blame that ``we are still on the same place
(in the peace talks) where we left in Geneva and in New York.''

   A covert CIA program to aid non-communist
rebels in Cambodia is operating at reduced levels following
discovery that military officers in Thailand had siphoned off some
$3.5 million, according to intelligence sources and a published
report.
   The corruption scandal, which may also have involved some Thai
businessmen, was reported in Sunday's Washington Post and confirmed
in part by other sources, who declined to be identified by name.
   The program, one of several Reagan administration initiatives to
bolster anti-communist forces in conflicts around the world, has
since been cleaned up but is operating at reduced levels. More
rigorous accounting procedures are in place, the newspaper reported.
   It said CIA officers in Thailand first turned up evidence that
money had been skimmed from the covert aid program, which totaled
$12 million in fiscal 1988. Some of the Cambodian rebels operate
from neighboring Thailand.
   The agency then tipped off the Senate Intelligence Committee,
which sent a four-member audit team to Thailand. The team, part of
a beefed-up independent auditing capability instituted by committee
chairman Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., and co-chairman William Cohen,
R-Maine, confirmed the existence of the scheme.
   The team's report back to the intelligence panel on July 12
sparked disagreement over whether the covert support should be
continued, the Post reported, citing a State Department document
detailing the developments.
   At the time, the administration was seeking to increase support
to resistance forces opposing Vietnamese troops inside Cambodia.
The program's aim is to establish a non-communist presence that
could prevent the return of the communist Khmer Rouge when the
Vietnamese pull troops out of Cambodia.
   After a debate within the intelligence panel it was decided to
continue the program, but to reduce the amount of U.S. support to
$8 million in the current year and to institute strict procedures
for making sure the money is spent for its intended purposes _
non-lethal items and training.
   The audit team later returned to Thailand to review how new
controls were working, and found ``solid evidence'' that proper
accounting was in place, the Post reported.
   The covert program in Cambodia, begun in 1982 or 1983, had until
then provoked little controversy and had received far less public
exposure than similar administration programs to support
anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua, Angola and Afghanistan.
   Boren declined to comment directly on the Post story, but issued
a statement saying he was ``deeply troubled'' by the reference to a
State Department document provided by an executive branch source.
   ``I have asked both the secretary of state and the director of
the CIA to determine if anyone in the executive branch has indeed
been compromising classified documents,'' Boren said.

   Chairman of the Palestine Liberation
Organization Yasser Arafat says regardless of the outcome of
Israel's elections he would be ready to join an international
conference on Palestinian rights.
   ``I am ready to sit in an international conference with
Israelis, no matter whom they send,'' Arafat says in an interview
in the Nov. 7 issue of Time magazine.
   ``The enemy will say, our representative is Sharon, our
representative is Peres, our representative is Rabin. I can't say
no,'' Arafat said, referring to Israeli rightist Ariel Sharon, and
Israeli Labor party leaders Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin.
   Israel's parliamentary elections are Tuesday.
   After the election, said Arafat, he would be willing to talk
with any Israelis ``who accept an international conference for
Palestininan rights according to international law and are ready to
fight together with us to implement peace in this area.''
   Arafat also predicted that neither the conservative Likud nor
the left-leaning Labor party will win a majority in the Tuesday
voting.
   ``I am sure there will be another coalition,'' he said.
Referring to the 10-month uprising by Palestinians in the Israeli
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arafat said, ``More than 50 of
the Israeli army is in the streets _ in the villages, in the towns,
in the camps.'' And he added: ``Definitely, no single party can
carry this responsibility.''

   A terminally ill woman who set up and attended
her own funeral says she'll remember it for the rest of her life _
and after.
   Carrie Munson, who overcame a quarter-century addiction to
heroin to earn a college degree at age 49, attended her funeral
Saturday at New Hope Baptist Church, wearing the cap and gown she
wore when she got her diploma.
   The 62-year-old Milwaukee woman, who suffers from pancreatic
cancer, said she planned her own funeral because she wanted to see
the faces of ``friends, associates and enemies.'' More than 100
people attended.
   ``You can't communicate with your friends and tell them how you
feel inside a box,'' Munson said as she peered around the church.
``As I look around, I don't see any enemies. All I see is friends.
   ``This is a moment in my life that I will never forget and after
I'm gone I'll remember it, too.''
   Munson said the funeral will provide the perfect ending to her
autobiography: ``Bury Me in My Cap and Gown.''
   In his eulogy, the Rev. R. L. Lathan praised Munson's faith in
God and determination.
   ``You have stood up with faith. You have challenged even the
medical society,'' Lathan said.
   ``Carrie, there is no guarantee you won't be able to wear that
cap and gown again,'' he said. ``Many of us here with you may beat
you to the grave.''
   For Munson, the cap and gown are something to be proud of.
   Until she was in her 40s, Munson had only a fourth-grade
education. After 25 years of drug addiction and small-time crime
and several suicide attempts, she decided to do something with her
life.
   Munson said she prayed, began to hate the drugs and set out to
prove herself by attending college.
   ``I knew I wasn't stupid. I knew I wasn't dumb,'' she said. ``If
I take what I learned on the street and put it into this B.A. ...
I'll have a masterpiece.''
   Munson graduated in 1975 from the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in journalism and mass
communications. Since then, she has worked as a radio jazz show
host and as a social worker.
   Ziff Sistrunk said he took a bus from Chicago to attend the
ceremony after reading about Munson's plans in the newspaper.
   During the funeral, he sang the Frank Sinatra hit ``I Did It My
Way,'' saying he had read that Munson cherished the song.
   Munson said she had a message for drug addicts and cancer
patients: ``Why be afraid? We've all got to die. Live every day to
the fullest. Don't sit around and worry about death.''

   As Labor Party leader Shimon Peres
walked through a crowded town market on a hand-shaking campaign
tour, a loyalist of the rival Likud bloc confronted him with an
angry question.
   ``I worked at Alliance Tire for 20 years, and now I've lost my
job,'' the man screamed. ``What are you going to do about it?''
   Peres, upset by hecklers drowning out his speech, shouted back
that the man should apply for unemployment.
   The acrimonious scene was a reminder that, though the
Palestinian uprising has been the focus of Israel's election
campaign, economic problems will be a major task facing whoever is
in office after Tuesday's elections.
   Economists are warning of a possible recession, a growing crisis
facing Israeli industry and a sharp rise in unemployment. Several
large unions threatened strikes even as election day approached.
   About 15,000 employees at three major Israeli banks held a
one-day strike Sunday. Leaders of the Histadrut, the nation's trade
union federation allied to the left-of-center Labor Party,
convinced most of them to return to work today. The workers, some
of whom earn as little as $600 a month, are demanding higher pay.
   Also, gasoline truckers demanding a 4.5 percent wage increase
nearly walked off the job, but the strike was averted when Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir agreed to discuss the truckers' demands at
Sunday's Cabinet meeting.
   Last week Koor, the nation's largest industrial conglomerate
employing 27,000 people, had to be bailed out by the government
after it defaulted on a $20 million loan.
   Shamir, who heads the right-wing Likud Party, immediately turned
that into a rallying cry for an end to Labor-backed policies that
traditionally have preserved jobs regardless of the cost.
   ``The concept of the Labor Party belongs to the past, it belongs
to East Europe at the beginning of the century,'' Shamir said in a
speech calling for ``a free economy and free enterprise.''
   Peres, though he has a say in the coalition government along
with Shamir, responded by blaming Likud for tight money policies
and high interest rates that have hampered industrial growth and
moved the economy precariously close to recession.
   ``Today there are 3,000 plants in distress,'' Peres charged in a
televised debate with Shamir. ``What plant can pay 30 percent to 35
percent interest? This entire policy rocks the economy.''
   How voters will respond to the rhetoric remains unclear. Hanoch
Smith, an independent pollster, says surveys so far have shown ``a
standoff between the two main parties'' on economic issues.
   Labor appears more vulnerable than Likud because the Histadrut
owns or controls many of the ailing industries, chief among them
Koor and the nation's largest insurance company.
   A few months ago, the Histadrut's ailing Alliance Tire & Rubber
Co. northeast of Tel Aviv was put in the hands of a state-appointed
receiver, and Israeli banks put up $8 million in emergency loans to
keep the company afloat.
   After a three-month closure, the plant was reopened Oct. 5 but
250 workers _ including the one who confronted Peres _ were not
recalled.
   Economists say Israeli's current industrial problems stem in
part from its success in dealing with another economic evil faced
when the coalition came to power in 1984 _ inflation.
   That year, consumer prices were rising a record 445 percent a
year.
   In July 1985, the government enacted an ``emergency
stabilization program'' with wage and price freezes, stringent
monetary controls and tight budget policies that have brought
inflation down to about 16 percent a year.
   Although the government has eased up since to allow limited wage
and price increases, continuing high interest rates and strict
exchange rate controls have squeezed business profits.
   In addition, the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip has sapped millions of dollars from the tourist
industry and from businesses that traditionally depend on Arab
workers, such as construction and textiles.
   One western-trained economist, who insisted on anonymity,
predicted the Israeli economy would grow 1 percent or less this
year, well below the government's target of 3.7 percent and down
sharply from last year's 5.2 percent growth.
   The nation's unemployment rate has risen from 5.6 percent at the
end of 1987 to nearly 6 percent in the first half of 1988, and some
economists believe it hit 7 percent in the July-September quarter.

   An avid football fan is hoping to score with a
book designed to help people tell the difference between the
end-around and the end zone.
   ``Football For Men And Women Who Want To Learn The Game,''
teaches the beginning fan the fundamentals of professional
football, author Donna Foehr said. It also contains information
about college, high school, pee-wee and Canadian football, she
added.
   ``Football is not for everyone, but there are a lot of people
who want to learn more about the game,'' she said.
   Foehr, 57, of suburban Bloomfield Hills, said she has gone to
football games for as long as she can remember and is a
season-ticket holder for Michigan State and Detroit Lions games.
   Almost all topics of the game are defined in the $9.95 book
published by National Press, from the dimensions of the field to
little-used plays like the drop kick.
   ``It took me about five months to write the book but once that
was done, I spent about 500 hours re-editing it,'' she said. ``It
seemed that every time the publisher sent me changes in the
manuscript, I would change them back again and that went on several
times.''

   Candidate David Hales apparently doesn't
believe in staying close to his intended constituency. He's
attending college about 3,000 miles away in Massachusetts while
seeking a Washington lawmaker's post.
   Hales, who is 18 and from Renton, near Seattle, easily won the
Democratic primary for state representative, but he was the only
one on the ballot.
   Hales, a student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge on an ROTC scholarship, left Washington state Aug. 25 and
has not actively campaigned for the seat now held by state Rep.
Bruce Holland, a Republican.
   ``I think a few of his friends are helping David but I haven't
seen any yard signs and don't know if they have been doorbelling,''
said Hales' mother, Martha.
   Why, if he didn't intend to campaign, did Hales file for office?
   ``David is interested in politics and the system and just wanted
to get involved and so decided to run for the Legislature,'' said
Mrs. Hales.
   Attempts to contact Hales at MIT were unsuccessful.
   As to Hales' candidacy, Holland said he isn't too happy with the
situation.
   ``I've taken a position on several issues and there's nobody
here to argue the other side so I don't get any feedback,'' said
Holland. ``I'll win because I'm here and he's not.''

   Most folks would be happy with $1 million but
not Lois Whitcomb. Wisconsin lottery's first $1 million winner says
she's ready to try for another million during a trip to Las Vegas.
   Mrs. Whitcomb, who runs a steak house with her husband in
Larsen, near Oshkosh, said they were going to a convention of
tavern owners in Las Vegas.
   ``I'll probably win a million out there,'' joked Mrs. Whitcomb,
who had the winning number in Saturday's drawing for the $1 million
prize. The trip had been planned before she became one of 10
finalists for the lottery drawing.
   Her actual winnings work out to about $730,000 after taxes,
which she will get in 20 installments of $36,535. She said the
money will not change her life.
   ``I just feel regular, everyday,'' the 46-year-old mother of
seven said Sunday, although ``I won't be working every weekend, I
hope.''
   Her husband, Robert, 66, who has had heart surgery, did not feel
well enough to attend the drawing Saturday, when he was
hospitalized briefly.
   ``Every time I get a little problem, they take me in,'' he said.
``I would like to have been there to give her a hug and a kiss.''
   The Wisconsin lottery started Sept. 14.

<TEXT>
   Some people flocked to the countryside
to see if Martians had landed, while others fled in fear after a
local radio station broadcast a 50th-anniversary rendition of Orson
Welles' ``War of the Worlds.''
   The 90-minute broadcast on Sunday had been advertised in
preceding days but nevertheless sparked scores of calls to police
and fire services in Braga, a northern city of 63,000 people.
   The curious drove to an area outside town where Radio Braga
reported aliens from Mars were landing, officials said. The
frightened began fleeing in cars, according to news reports from
the area.
   Lines reportedly formed at some gas stations in Braga, 200 miles
north of the capital, Lisbon.
   The broadcast was a recreation of Welles' radio dramatization of
the H.G. Wells novel ``The War of the Worlds.''
   On Oct. 30, 1938, the actor and director interrupted radio
broadcasts in the United States with a report that Martians had
landed in New Jersey. That broadcast caused hundreds of thousands
of people to panic.
   In Braga, police were called to control 150 to 200 demonstrators
who gathered outside the studios of Radio Braga to protest the
broadcast of the recreation of Welles' version, said Paulo Sousa, a
reporter at the station.
   Sousa said the station received more than 100 calls. ``Some
called to complain, some to inquire and some to offer
congratulations,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Sousa said the broadcast was intended as an homage to Welles and
had been well publicized previously in newspapers and on the radio
station itself. He said the program itself also contained clues
that it was fiction.
   A police spokesman in Braga, who asked not to be named,
confirmed police had been called to the radio station. He said many
people believed the broadcast initially, but added that no serious
incidents were reported.

   Bud Clark exchanged his bartender's apron
for the mayor's mantle four years ago and, barring a long-shot
victory by one of the three police chiefs to leave his
administration, will remain a mixologist of policy, not drinks.
   Ron Still, who resigned as police chief after Clark took office,
advanced to the Nov. 8 runoff election after winning 33.6 percent
of the primary vote.
   Eleven candidates fragmented the vote, and Clark fell just short
of topping the 50 percent plus one vote need to avert a runoff.
   A poll by KATU-TV Oct. 13 showed Clark leading Still, 58 percent
to 32 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The margin of error was
plus or minus 5 points.
   Clark, owner of the popular Goose Hollow Tavern, points to such
accomplishments during his first term as voter approval of a bond
measure for a convention center and formulation of a plan to deal
with the city's homeless.
   Still has made veiled criticisms of Clark's eccentricities,
which include a victory cry of ``Whoop! Whoop!'' once performed on
``The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson'' and a penchant for
wearing shorts and suspenders.
   Clark once posed for a poster that carried the caption ``Expose
Yourself to Art'' and showed a back view of a man opening an
overcoat in front of a statue.
   ``Portland needs a mayor who knows when to wear lederhosen and
when to wear a three-piece suit,'' Still said early in the campaign.
   ``A lot of people say they want their mayor to look and act like
someone who can run a multimillion-dollar corporation,'' said
Carolyn Gaudry, Still's campaign manager.
   For his part, Clark said he is one of many mayors ``who have
used certain antics in drawing attention to their city.''
   Still also has criticized Clark for his handling of the police.
Still's resignation led to Clark's selection of Penny Harrington as
the nation's first female chief of a big-city police department.
   She resigned after a mayoral commission criticized her
management style. Clark replaced her with Jim Davis, but later
fired Davis during an argument at a cafe.
   Still has tried to pin Portland's crime problem to Clark, under
whose administration the city's first gang-related shootings
occurred. Gang members, seeking to increase their drug markets,
have flocked from Los Angeles to Portland and other western cities.
   Under his tenure, Clark responded, this city of 420,000
residents has succeeded in reducing the frequency of some crimes,
such as burglary. Fighting crime would be a high priority in his
next term, he said.
   Aides to Clark and Still say each side will have spent about
$500,000 by the Nov. 8 election, making this the most expensive
campaign in city history for the $60,000-per-year mayor's job.
   The race officially is non-partisan, but Clark showed his
allegiance to the Democratic Party during its presidential
nominating convention, when he announced the vote of the Oregon
delegation. Still is Republican.

   The sheriff's secretary spent a night
behind bars in the St. Clair County Jail, as did the manager of the
farm bureau and some of the sheriff's friends.
   They were guilty of no known wrongdoing.
   They spent Friday night in jail for laughs and worthy causes.
   ``It just seemed like something different to do,'' said Tom
Jett, county farm bureau manager. ``You don't get the opportunity
to do this very often _ come in here and be able to leave.''
   Twenty-five people spent the night in jail as part of a program
called ``Slumber in the Slammer.''
   That's what Sheriff Mearl Justus called an all-night party to
break in a $2.7 million jail addition dedicated earlier in the day.
   Participants gave donations for the privilege of going to jail,
with money going to the Women's Crisis Center and for a memorial
being built near the jail to honor officers killed in the line of
duty.
   ``I think it was successful,'' Justus said. ``We ought to net a
couple thousand dollars for each cause.''
   When it was time to release the honorary detainees about 7 a.m.
Saturday, Justus' secretary, Pat Buxton, said a night behind bars
gave her a different perspective.
   ``I'm just glad I get to go home at five every night,'' she said.
   Like most inmates, the one-nighters complained about the
accommodations.
   Pillows were a hot commodity.
   When Jim and Fran Smith, friends of Justus and the sheriff's
wife, Audrey, got to the jail, they found their bunks, but no
pillows.
   ``I sent him home for two pillows,'' Fran Smith said of her
husband. ``He came back with two pillow cases.''
   Justus came to the rescue with some pillows.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Monday,
while share prices inched up on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues finished trading
at 27,982.54, adding 21.53 points, or 0.08 percent. The index
closed at 27,961.01 Saturday.
   The dollar closed at 125.00, down 1.08 yen from Friday's close
of 126.08 yen. Opening at 125.72 yen, the currency moved in a range
of 124.98-125.85 yen.
   Exchange dealers attributed the weaker dollar to a decline in
the currency on overseas markets. They said there was a general
perception that the U.S. economy was beginning to show signs of
slowing down and that was driving the dollar down.
   They added, however, market participants were concerned over
intervention by the Bank of Japan to prop up the dollar and prevent
its further fall against the yen.
   ``The market's sentiment appears to be inclined toward a weaker
dollar,'' said Yoshikazu Kotouge, dealer at Yasuda Trust Bank in
Tokyo. ``But there was some buying of the dollar at around the
125.70-yen level, and that's keeping the dollar from falling
rapidly.''
   Dealers said that despite intervention by the Bank of Japan on a
small scale several times Monday morning, the central bank was not
able to stop the dollar's decline.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei was lower in early
morning trading due to profit-taking, but dealers said the market
was still bullish after gains last week.
   ``Investors took advantage of last week's gain and as a result,
share prices opened lower,'' said a broker at a major Japanese
securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``But the general sentiment of the market is still bullish.
Share prices appear to have managed to turn toward profit-taking
near the end of the morning session,'' he said.
   The Nikkei index topped the 28,000 level at midmorning Monday
for the first time since Sept.19, the day Emperor Hirohito fell
seriously ill.

<HEAD>20 Years Later, Hollywood Has Mixed Reviews For Film Rating System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The film ratings system, which at its inception
gave a G to ``Dracula Has Risen From the Grave,'' turns 20 years
old Tuesday to mixed reviews from Hollywood insiders and outsiders.
   To groups denouncing what they see as a penchant by the film
industry for sex, violence and drugs, the Motion Picture
Association of America's ratings system is inadequate.
   To many filmmakers, an X rating, or even a family-oriented G,
means box-office poison, and obtaining a PG-13 or an R has become
imperative, the equivalent of a mass-marketing seal of approval.
   To Gene Siskel, film critic for the Chicago Tribune, ``The
R-rated category is now so widespread, and covers so many emotions
and physical acts that I don't know how valuable it is to parents.''
   But to Jack Valenti, who has overseen the rating system for two
decades as the association's president and chief executive officer,
the film code has achieved at least one feat.
   ``I think just the act of surviving is itself a minor triumph,''
Valenti said in a recent interview.
   The ratings, however, have gotten less than rave reviews from
Thomas E. Radecki, chairman of the National Coalition on Television
Violence.
   ``It's a system designed to placate the public,'' Radecki said,
``and to prevent a public rating system from coming into
existence.''
   Radecki conceded that the code is better than none, but argued
the ratings are ``why we have so much more violent and sexually
degrading films than we did when the rating system was started.''
   Radecki would prefer a ratings system with specific guidelines,
something like the 1934 code that prohibited ``passion that
stimulates the baser emotions'' and ``lustful kissing.''
   He contends that rating guidelines should forbid the use of
alcohol or drugs in PG-rated movies.
   But Valenti, who dismisses Radecki's group as ``right-wing
zealots,'' said he's rejected pleas to designate a variety of
things depicted in films as taboo, including sex, violence, drug
use, smoking and even animal cruelty.
   ``Pretty soon we would put such baggage on this rating system it
would collapse,'' Valenti said.
   The principal guideline given board members, Valenti said, is:
``If you had to meet with the parents of Wichita Falls, Texas,
tomorrow, do you believe they would find what you want to rate this
picture to be fair and reasonable?''
   Valenti also disputed arguments the ratings have somehow
encouraged Hollywood sex and violence. He said the ratings are a
mirror of society's values and that the association surveys
moviegoers' attitudes toward the code each year to measure its
success.
   ``Over the last decade, 65 percent to 73 (percent) of all
parents with children under 13 say it's `very useful to fairly
useful' in helping them'' determine which movies their children
see, Valenti said, ``and 20 to 23 percent find it not useful at
all.''
   ``Now by political standards that's a landslide,'' he added.
   The board's nine members ``are neither gods nor fools,'' Valenti
said. ``They're just people who like movies, and they're parents
and they're intelligent.''
   Valenti hires the board's chairman, and together they select the
eight other members.
   The board's costs are underwritten by a fee each filmmaker must
pay in submitting the movie to be rated. Appeals are possible only
to a 22-member board comprising theater owners, independent
producers and distributors and major producers and distributors.
   The first film rated by the board was ``Dracula Has Risen From
the Grave,'' which got a G rating, said Barbara Dixon, an
association spokeswoman in Washington, D.C.
   Soon, ``Midnight Cowboy,'' which starred Dustin Hoffman and Jon
Voight, was given an X but still managed to win the Oscar for Best
Picture of 1969.
   Altogether, the association has rated 8,460 films, Valenti said.
He said no more than 100 of them have created any controversy,
citing disputes over ratings assigned such films as ``Angel
Heart,'' ``Cruising'' and 1983's ``Scarface.''
   Of the total, Ms. Dixon said, 11.1 percent were G-rated; 33.4
percent were PG; 3.4 percent were PG-13 (a category instituted in
1984); 47.8 percent were R-rated and 4.3 percent were X-rated.
   Ms. Dixon noted that pornographic filmmakers do not submit their
films for screening, and eagerly apply multiple Xs to their films
themselves.

<HEAD>Eighty Five Detained In Thursday Roundup, Charter Spokesmen Held</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 85 people were detained
in a massive police roundup of dissidents that coincided with the
70th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence, a dissident
source said.
   Anna Sabatova, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights
document, said Sunday that most were rounded up on Thursday and
that all three of the movement's spokesmen were among those
detained.
   One spokesman, Milos Hajek, apparently was detained after going
to Prague's Wenceslas Square on Friday to attend a banned
independent rally marking the anniversary, Sabatova said.
   Hajek did not return home after the rally, which was broken up
by riot police using water cannon and tear gas.
   Another spokesman, Bohumir Janat, was detained with his
girlfriend on and another man in Lany, 30 miles west of Prague, as
they went Saturday to lay flowers on the grave of Tomas Garrigue
Masaryk, Sabatova said.
   Masaryk was the first president of democratic Czechoslovakia,
although Communist authorities give him scant attention.
   Sabatova said other people in the group Janat was with made it
to the Lany cemetery to lay a bouquet from Charter 77 on Masaryk's
grave.
   Wreaths from the presidency, the national parliament and the
Communist-led National Front were laid on the grave in a low-key,
10-minute ceremony on Thursday.
   Sabatova, who is also a leading activist of VONS, the Committee
for the Unjustly Prosecuted, said at least 85 people were detained
in a massive roundup of dissidents on Thursday. Those held included
the third Charter 77 spokesman, Stanislav Devaty.
   Only one person detained, Tomas Hradilek, had been reported
freed. He was released on Saturday, but detained again after he
laid a wreath on a spot in Prague where there used to be a statue
of Masaryk, Sabatova said.
   Customarily, police hold dissidents in such roundups for 48
hours and then release them without charges.
   At least one man, Charter 77 signatory Vaclav Benda, was
released Saturday and rearrested immediately, his wife said.

   Voters re-elected a mayor who ran on his
longstanding and strident opposition to having U.S. military
housing built in a forested oasis that is a sanctuary to birds and
other wildlife.
   But despite the return to office Sunday of Mayor Kichiro Tomino,
the national government appears determined to go ahead with the
housing project in this city 30 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The housing would relieve crowding at the nearby Yokosuka Naval
Base, home port of the U.S. Seventh Fleet.
   ``This is a clear indication of the wishes of the residents of
Zushi,'' Tomino said in a victory speech. He said he hoped the
government would take heed of the residents' wishes and reconsider
the project.
   In the hotly contested election, Tomino defeated physician
Tadashi Ina, a proponent of the construction plan, by just over
3,000 votes.
   Backing Ina was the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, which
has governed Japan for most of the postwar period.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita told reporters today that he
expected Tomino's victory and ``the construction will progress,''
according to the Kyodo News Service.
   The U.S. military has tried to keep a low profile over the
drawn-out housing controversy, saying it was a matter for the
Japanese to work out.
   Voter turnout was reportly high after the polls opened Sunday,
and when the ballots were counted this morning Tomino had 17,507
votes to Ina's 14,489.
   At stake in the election was about a quarter of the Ikego Hills,
more than 700 acres of forest in the center of Zushi, a town of
58,000 in Kanagawa prefecture.
   The forest has gone almost untouched for half a century and is a
sanctuary for birds and other wildlife in an otherwise densely
populated area.
   Environmentalists and local housewives drew national attention
with their campaign to defy the plan the central government
announced six years ago to build more than 900 apartment units in
Ikego.
   The location was picked because it is the former site of a
Japanese imperial navy ammunition dump. In recent weeks, the
Defense Facilities Administration Agency has begun clearing trees
at the fringes of the hills.
   Under a bilateral security treaty, Japan must supply land and
help pay the cost of maintaining the 48,000 American military
personnel stationed nationwide. Due in part to the weak dollar,
private off-base housing is expensive for U.S. personnel.
   In an unsuccessful compromise proposed by Kanagawa Governor
Kazuji Nagasu last year, the number of units was reduced to 854 on
205 acres of land.
   Tomino, first elected in 1984, rejected the compromise and
resigned last year to force a new election and demonstrate local
opposition to the construction. He also was re-elected in that
election.
   Sunday's election was held because Tomino's original four-year
term had expired.
   During this year's campaign, Ina argued that Tomino's opposition
to the plan had been ineffective and that it was time for Zushi
residents to look to the future and put the Ikego issue behind them.
   In February, Tomino flew to Washington to plead his case but was
turned back by U.S. congressmen who said they were too busy to hear
him out.

   An American military helicopter crashed Monday
during a training mission on Okinawa, killing four U.S. Marines,
the United States Media Liaison Office said.
   Marine Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues said two CH-46 Seaknight
helicopters were involved in routine training when one crashed in
remote, mountainous terrain on the Japanese island.
   The second helicopter returned to its base at Marine Corp Air
Station at Sutenma.
   Rodrigues declined to say how many people were on the helicopter
when it crashed or speculate as to why it went down, and said names
of the victims were being withheld pending notification of next of
kin.
   The two helicopters were assigned to Marine Medium Helicopter
Squadron 262.
   He said the accident was under investigation.

   Lincoln H. Clark, a co-founder of CARE
who in 1946 delivered the international relief organization's first
package to France, has died of cancer at age 77.
   Clark, who died at his home on Friday, also served as director
of the Maine Court Mediation Service from 1981 until this year. He
was appointed in 1981 special master of the Pineland Center in
Pownal to oversee compliance with a 1978 court order to improve the
lives of the mentally handicapped residents at the state-run
facility.
   A native of New Rochelle, N.Y., Clark received a doctorate from
the University of Chicago and was a professor of marketing at
universities in four states. During World War II, he served as
executive secretary of the War Production Board.
   After the war, he helped found the New York-based CARE and
worked for the agency, delivering the first CARE package to
LeHavre, France, in 1946. He served as a consultant to four
countries on United Nations matters.
   Clark was editor of the Journal of Marketing from 1955-57, and
was chairman of the board of Aero-Nautical Inc. of Greenwich,
Conn., from 1962-76.
   Clark is survived by his wife of 16 years, Anne Randolph Clark,
four sons and six daughters. His first wife, Alice Hardenbergh
Clark, died in 1971.
   A memorial service will be held Thursday in Portland.

   A refinery tank exploded, killing two
workers and critically injuring two others after covering the four
with molten asphalt that burned through layers of clothing and
hardened on their bodies, officials said.
   Sunday's fire and the resulting explosion in the tank, which was
several stories high, were contained within 30 minutes by refinery
firefighters, said Elise Sims, spokeswoman for Amoco Oil Co.
   The explosion, the second this month at the refinery off Lake
Michigan, ``sounded like a vacuum-packed puff,'' said Michael Kowal
of Whiting, who was driving by the refinery just northwest of Gary.
``Next thing I know there was black smoke 100 to 200 feet in the
air. It just pushed it up like a mushroom cloud.''
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, said Amoco
spokesman Charles R. Mason.
   George Kusbel, Leo Gonzalez and Robert Zivich had hardened
asphalt up to half an inch thick on parts of their bodies when they
were brought to St. Catherine's Hospital in East Chicago, said
emergency room Dr. Michael Pepper.
   ``We had to cut all their clothes off with a cast saw,'' Pepper
said. ``Most of them had two or three layers of clothes on because
of the cold weather, so it burned right through their clothes.''
   Kusbel, 37, of Whiting, died six hours after suffering
third-degree burns over more than 80 percent of his body, and
Michael Zimmerman, 44, was pronounced dead on the scene, officials
said.
   Gonzalez, 40, of East Chicago, and Zivich, 44, of Dyer, were in
critical condition at hospitals today with third-degree burns over
much of their bodies, officials said.
   The refinery in this Chicago suburb along the Illinois-Indiana
state line was once the largest in the nation and has been the
scene of several major fires in the past 10 years.
   Two men were hurt in a fire and explosion in a different part of
the plant Oct. 6.
   In April, 16 people were injured in an explosion and small fire
in a processing unit.
   A December 1984 fire destroyed two bulk storage tanks and forced
the evacuation of about 100 people. In 1979, a series of explosions
and the ensuing fire forced the evacuation of about 1,500 residents.
   A 1955 explosion at the refinery killed two people, injured 35
others and destroyed 70 storage tanks and 200 homes.
   Mason said the refinery's safety record is good.
   ``The asphalt unit, up to about the first of October, had gone
350-some days without a disabling injury. It had the best safety
record of any unit in the refinery,'' Mason said.

<HEAD>New Military Chief Advocates Broad Solution For Ending War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE CABRERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An army officer who says
winning the loyalty of the poor is necessary to win the country's
civil war has been named head of the military.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, a brigade commander, takes command of
the military forces on Tuesday, replacing Gen. Adolfo Blandon, who
is going to France as military attache.
   Blandon, head of the joint chiefs of staff since 1983, announced
the change of command within the U.S.-backed government in a local
television interview broadcast late Saturday.
   The 48-year-old general, who had been expected to step down by
year's end, said his transfer ``is not related to the political
situation. It is necessary to open spaces for new generations.''
   Ponce, 41, was singled out as an exceptional commander by four
U.S. Army lieutenant colonels earlier this year in a Harvard
fellowship analysis of the Salvadoran civil war.
   ``We cannot think that solely by military means we are going to
resolve this war,'' Ponce said this year. ``Even if we kill all the
subversives, the problem will not end. Such deplorable
socio-economic conditions would remain that it (insurgency) could
easily revive.''
   Rebel and government negotiators have met three times, most
recently in October 1987, in an unsuccessful bid to negotiate a
cease-fire in the 8-year-old civil war.
   On Sunday, two rebel commanders arrived in Panama City for talks
with the Rev. Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of San Salvador, on the possible resumption of peace talks.
   Joaquin Villalobos and Leonel Gonzalez said they planned to meet
today with Rivera y Damas and the Rev. Emile Stehle of West
Germany. Stehle has participated as an observer in previous
government-rebel talks.
   Ponce commands the 3rd Infantry Brigade and belongs to the
``tandona,'' a tight-knit block of officers who have consolidated
control of the armed forces in recent months.
   Blandon will leave the nation with a legacy of a larger
military. He increased its size to 50,000 troops and accompanied
President Jose Napoleon Duarte in meetings with rebel leaders.
   At the request of U.S. military advisers, Blandon has increased
use of small strike forces against guerrillas rather than sweeping
offensives.
   More than 65,000 Salvadorans, mostly civilians, have been killed
in the civil war.

   The lone operating reactor at Three Mile
Island made an unscheduled shutdown for reasons believed to have
originated in the plant's non-nuclear turbine system, a spokesman
said.
   The Unit 1 reactor shut down automatically at 8:50 a.m. Sunday,
said Gordon Tomb, a spokesman for plant operator GPU Nuclear Corp.
   Plant systems operated normally during the shutdown and no
emergency condition existed, he said.
   The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified, Tomb
said. Plant and agency officials checked the system to try to
determine the cause of the shutdown, which occurred as the reactor
was operating at full power, he said.
   Three Mile Island was the site of the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident when equipment failures and human error led to a
loss of coolant and partial core meltdown in the plant's Unit 2
reactor on March 28, 1979.
   The NRC approved the restart of the undamaged Unit 1 reactor in
May 1985.

<HEAD>American Woman Priest Holds Unauthorized Communion in London
Despite Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American woman priest celebrated Communion with
an Anglican feminist group outside a chapel where their services
were banned after receiving widespread publicity.
   ``God is here,'' the Rev. Suzanne Fageol of Chicago said during
the hourlong service Sunday night outside St. Benet Chapel.
   ``Her spirit is with us,'' was the united response from nearly
100 mainly women supporters.
   Ms. Fageol, 38, was ordained in the United States, where the
Episcopal Church is one several provinces of the worldwide Anglican
Communion to ordain women. The Church of England's governing
General Synod has decided to move toward ordination of women, but
there is much opposition at all levels.
   Ms. Fageol had been celebrating Communion in St. Benet Chapel at
the request of St. Hilda's Community group since spring of 1978.
   But her service on Oct. 23, widely reported and photographed,
led lawyers for the London Diocese and Fund, which administers
property for the Bishop of London, to warn the group it would
consider unauthorized services in the chapel as trespassing.
   Bishop of London Graham Leonard, a leading opponent of efforts
to allow women priests in the Church of England, told Ms. Fageol in
a letter Thursday: ``I greatly deplore the use of the sacrament for
the purposes of protest and for promoting a cause.''
   Leonard said neither he nor Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, the Anglicans' spiritual leader, had authority ``to permit
you as an Anglican and a woman priest ordained abroad'' to act as a
priest in Britain, where the church does not allow the ordination
of women priests.
   But on Sunday night the group set up a folding table outside to
hold the Communion wine, wholemeal bread rolls and candles, and
proceeded with the Eucharist.
   After the service, Ms. Fageol said: ``I don't feel I am defying
the church. I don't feel I am doing anything wrong.
   ``It isn't a deliberate act of defiance against the church, it's
a deliberate giving of faith and witness and pastoral
responsibility to a group of people who are trying to worship in a
way they find useful spiritually,'' she said.
   Ms Fageol is attached to a parish church in Leeds, England,
while studying for a doctorate. She said she intended to continue
holding Communion for the St. Hilda's group as soon as they could
find a new home.
   The archbishop of York, Dr. John Habgood, said in a service at
York Minster on Saturday that the cause of women's ordination,
which he supports, could be endangered by these unauthorized
services.

   A child bending down to pick up a stone
while posing for a family photograph plunged 80 feet off a ledge at
a park but survived in serious condition, authorities said.
   Amy Michelle Walker, 2, of Lyons suffered a head injury and a
broken nose as a result of her fall at Silver Falls State Park,
authorities said.
   ``The doctor said she is doing good. It's nothing she's not
going to recover from,'' said state police Sgt. Randy Westbrook.
   The girl bent down to pick up a stone while posing for a picture
but lost her footing and fell from a trail at the park's South
Falls shortly after noon Sunday, said Westbrook.
   She slid and tumbled the first 40 feet down the steep incline,
then fell through the air to a creek bank below, Westbrook said.
   The girl's father carried her to a parking lot, where a
helicopter picked her up. She was taken to Emanuel Hospital &
Health Center in Portland and listed in serious condition Sunday
night, a nursing supervisor said.
   Westbrook, who spoke with the girl's doctor, said she suffered a
broken nose, a skull fracture, and cuts and bruises.
   ``I'd say it was just luck that she wasn't hurt worse than she
was,'' he said.
   ``We were expecting a lot worse.''

^Kidnappers Release Videotaped Message from Anderson</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: COMBINES urgent series, UPDATES with details of message,

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers on
Monday released a videotaped message from one of their two American
captives, journalist Terry Anderson, a few days after he turned 41.
   The tape was delivered to a Western news agency office in Beirut
along with a statement in Arabic.
   ``My name is Terry Anderson,'' the captive began his message in
English. ``Once again I have been given the chance to speak to my
government, my family and my people.
   ``I love you, I miss you very much. I know of your continued
strong efforts for me ... the work and devotion of my friends and
colleagues, and many people I don't know. I know I cannot repay
you,'' said Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   Anderson was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut and is the
longest-held of the 14 foreigners still missing in Lebanon and
presumed captives of kidnappers. Nine of the 14 are Americans.
   He was seized by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War, and marked a fourth birthday in captivity on
Thursday.
   Islamic Jihad's statement that accompanied the videotape said:
``To the families of American hostages ... to the family of Terry
Anderson.
   ``On the occasion of Terry Anderson's birthday and in response
to your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recorded
message, we hereby enclose with this statement the recorded message
on videotape,'' it said.
   Anderson appeared relaxed as he read from a prepared statement.
He was cleanshaven and wore his eyeglasses.
   His hair was neatly combed. He appeared from the waist up,
wearing a striped grey sweater.
   ``I am well and being well treated and I received your birthday
greetings and as always I thank you very much,'' he said. Letters
from family members and colleagues appeared in Beirut newspapers
last week.
   ``As my fourth birthday in captivity passes and the end of my
fourth year in captivity approaches, I find it difficult to keep my
hope and courage high,'' Anderson said.
   The last previous videotape message from Anderson was released
on Dec. 24. In it, appearing to read from a prepared text, the
journalist criticized the Reagan administration for failing to
secure his and fellow prisoners' freedom and warned ``There's a
limit to how long we can last.''
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, an American who is
acting dean of agriculture at American University. He was kidnapped
on June 10, 1985.

   A Key West-style celebration of Halloween
attracted cave dwellers, Romans and Greeks and some people who
apparently interpreted the festival theme of ``B.C.'' as meaning
``Before Clothes.''
   The island town's historic district was jammed with
costumed-revelers for the Nighttime Fantasy Parade that stretched
well into the wee hours of Sunday, said Michael Whalton, director
of the 10th annual Fantasy Fest.
   The parade, whose theme was ``Fantasy B.C.,'' brought out Fred
and Wilma Flintstone and all their friends to mix and mingle with
ancient Greeks and Egyptians and some bizarre space creatures,
along with a few who caught more eyes for what they weren't wearing.
   ``My costume? I'm a caveman, of course,'' said Larry Fleischman,
a retired Internal Revenue Service officer who wore only a
itsy-bitsy loincloth. ``Actually, I'm a dirty old man with very
little on.''
   More than 100 fundamentalist Christians mingled with the 40,000
revelers, passing out pamphlets and trying to keep things in check.
Fest organizers have cut out the too-titillating outfits worn by
some in the parade's early years.
   ``It's a chance to let your hair down and be crazy.'' said
Barbara Sheckler, a resident of Miami who has been to two other
Fantasy Fests.
   The parade culminated seven days of masquerade balls, costume
contests and other zany events. Even four-legged masqueraders got
into the party spirit with a pet costume contest.

   Cathy May Sliker has reason to believe more
than one person was behind the theft of her family's pumpkin. It
weighed 246 pounds.
   The pumpkin was snatched last week from the front porch of the
family's home in northwest Pennsylvania.
   Sliker said she and a friend had to use a wheelbarrow to bring
the pumpkin her home. She said she used a bathroom scale to
determine the weight of the pumpkin, which was 2{-feet in diameter.
   Her four children had planned to carve the pumpkin into a
jack-o'-lantern and put a flashlight inside to display it for
Halloween.

   Trick-or-treaters are going ape over the

   Once the terror of New York City, King Kong glares down on
passers-by, fangs bared and a likelike paw clutching a terrified
Fay Wray against the roof of Dawn and Kenneth Wilkinson's house.
   Dawn Wilkinson, 27, is delighted that people appreciate her
50-foot replica of the sinister simian.
   ``We've had kids out here with their hands over their mouths,
jumping up and down on the sidewalk,'' she said. ``A school bus

family portraits in front of him.''
   Using molding plaster, 80 feet of pipes, 800 feet of wire
fencing and $150 worth of black garbage bags, the Wilkinsons worked
on King Kong for more than a month and spent $700 on their
Halloween decorating project.
   They had planned to hoist King Kong, but he had other ideas.

   The Grinch who stole Halloween apparently had a
change of heart and returned a 19-foot inflated jack-o'-lantern
stolen from a residence for families of children being treated for
cancer.
   The lighted orange balloon, financed by a gift from a California
family, was inflated and tethered to stakes in the lawn outside the
Ronald McDonald House late Friday but was gone by Saturday morning.
   The balloon reappeared on the doorstep Sunday and was reinflated
to the relief and renewed delight of staff, patients and their
relatives.
   ``I guess they felt guilty and brought it back,'' said officer
Jeff Bray.
   The balloon weighs about 100 pounds and is valued at about
$2,500.
   ``I can't believe someone would steal it from a place like
that,'' said Shad Dean of the Elliott Bay Balloon Co., who helped
set up the great pumpkin. ``When we got it set up, the kids were
down there loving it and carrying on. I'm not an emotional guy, but
I was touched.''

   A trucker was behind bars today after
a 70-mile rampage in which an officer was shot and several
motorists were forced off a highway, including a woman who died
when her vehicle flipped, officials said.
   Denver Jerome Burrell, 30, of Anderson, S.C., was arrested after
the hour-long rampage Sunday along Interstate 10 in a remote,
mountainous section of west Texas, said David Wells, a state
Department of Public Safety spokesman.
   ``The only thing we know is he was high _ evidently on drugs,''
said Trooper Bob Newman of El Paso. The officers who arrested
Burrell ``said he was out of his mind,'' and witnesses said he
appeared disoriented, according to Newman.
   Burrell was in the Hudspeth County Jail in lieu of $400,000 in
bonds on charges of attempted capital murder, involuntary
manslaughter and driving under the influence of a controlled
substance, officials said.
   The rampage began near Van Horn, about 100 miles southeast of El
Paso, Newman said. As the tractor-trailer continued west on I-10,
it rammed a four-wheel-drive vehicle driven by Sharon Marie Agutter.
   The 48-year-old El Paso woman's vehicle careened off the road,
and flipped. She was pronounced dead at the scene.
   The tractor-trailer, which was hauling light bulbs from South
Carolina to Nevada, next rammed a Winnebago pulling a compact car
on a trailer, smashing the car. The Winnebago's driver was unhurt,
but followed the truck.
   County Constable Sonny Hillin and a U.S. Border Patrol agent
chased Burrell, and managed to stop him, Newman said.
   But as Hillin stepped out of his patrol car, the truck driver
tried to pin the officer against his car, Newman said.
   Hillin scrambled back to his car and stopped the truck again by
pulling in front of it. But Burrell shot through his own
windshield, hitting the officer in the neck, Newman said.
   Hillin's wife, Jackie, who operates a volunteer ambulance
service for Hudspeth County, said she and her son-in-law took
Hillin to Vista Hills Medical Center in El Paso, where he was
listed as stable condition late Sunday.
   Officers pursued the truck for several more miles. Burrell
finally stopped about a half mile west of Fort Hancock, then
surrendered without incident, Newman said.
   A .357-caliber Magnum revolver was found on the dashboard, he
said.

was threatened by a burning house next door.
   King watched as flames consumed a neighboring house and
threatened her own home early today. She fought to hold back tears
as firefighters doused her roof to keep the fire from spreading.
   ``It started in a garage and spread to the two houses next to
mine,'' King said. ``Somebody had to have set it. ... There's just
no excuse for it.''
   Firefighters saved King's house but the two other dwellings were
gutted, leaving at least three people homeless, including a
77-year-old invalid.
   Devil's Night, traditionally a night of pranks in Detroit, grew
into a night of arson, peaking in 1984 with 810 fires that killed
one person and left dozens homeless. Last year, the number dropped
to 290 fires over a two-day holiday weekend.
   Firefighters questioned Sunday night said the downward trend
appears to be continuing this year.
   ``It seems to be going down every year,'' said one firefighter,
who declined to give his name. ``Maybe people are getting tired of
it (Devil's Night).''
   The number of arson fires during this Devil's Night weekend
won't be available until Tuesday or Wednesday, said Robert Berg, a
spokesman for Mayor Coleman Young.
   About 20,000 citizen volunteers joined city employees in
patrolling the streets. The volunteer force, including members of
citizens band radio clubs, block clubs and other organizations, was
twice the number deployed in the past few years, Berg said.
   Fascination with the Devil's Night tradition drew observers from
all over the country.
   ``Yeah, I got some raised eyebrows when I told people I was
going to Detroit for the weekend,'' said Dave Purcell, a College
Park, Md., resident. ``But there's nothing like Devil's Night in
the United States.''
   Purcell, a volunteer firefighter, said he and three friends flew
to Detroit for a weekend of chasing fires and taking pictures.
   ``We like seeing a big city fire department in action, and we're
guaranteed of seeing some action on Devil's Night,'' Purcell said.
   Officer Fred Zaharoff, a police spokesman, said no arson-related
arrests were reported Sunday.
   A 6 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew for youths under 18 took effect Saturday
night and will continue through Tuesday night. Police picked up 119
youngsters Sunday night and 278 on Saturday night for violating the
curfew, Zaharoff said.
   Elsewhere, Halloween festivities resulted in the arrest of 125
people in the college town of Athens, Ohio. Police said between
8,000 and 10,000 people, mostly Ohio University students, took over
a section of town Saturday night for the celebration. Most of the
arrests were for disorderly conduct.
   In Kent, Ohio, home of Kent State University, police say 32
people were arrested during a downtown Halloween celebration.
   In Carbondale, Ill., police arrested more than 190 people during
a two-day Halloween street festival.
   ``It was a typical beer blast with drinking in the streets,''
said Carbondale police Sgt. William Holmes. ``What happened is
about par for the course _ as people get drunker they get a little
rowdier ... and there are usually more than 100 arrests.''
   Holmes said there were no serious injuries to police or the more
than 15,000 festival-goers.

   The dollar was lower against major currencies in
thin European mid-morning trading today ahead of a religious
holiday in several countries. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said pressure to square trading
positions before the end of the month partly caused the slight
lowering of the U.S. currency.
   They said trading rooms were closing down in a number of
European countries for All Saints Day on Tuesday, and other dealers
had taken a four-day weekend.
   They added that the dollar was unlikely to suffer sharp swings
this week before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.
   ``No matter who wins the market will still be bearish on the
dollar,'' said a trader in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 1.08 Japanese yen to a closing 125.00 yen.
Later, in London, it rose slightly to 124.95 yen.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates, compared with late Friday:
   _1.7760 West German marks, up from 1.7755
   _1.4905 Swiss francs, down from 1.4970
   _6.0415 French francs, down from 6.0750
   _1.9969 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0010
   _1,315.50 Italian lire, down from 1,321.50
   _1.2192 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2035
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7770 from $1.7680 late
Friday.
   Gold opened at a bid price of $412.50 a troy ounce, higher than
its late bid price Friday of $410.50. At mid-morning today the
city's five major bullion dealers fixed a slightly lower
recommended price of $412.30.
   In Zurich, the mid-morning bid price was $412.30, up from
$411.25 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 18 cents to close at a bid
$414.46, up slightly from Saturday's $414.28.
   Silver bullion was traded at a bid price of $6.31 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Friday.

<HEAD>Girl Injured With Lawn Dart Emerges From Drug-Induced Coma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old girl whose skull was
pierced by a lawn dart has emerged from her drug-induced coma, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   Amy Herrin of McMinnville regained consciousness early Sunday
morning, said Nancy Humphrey, spokeswoman for Vanderbilt University
Medical Center. Doctors Saturday stopped administering the
coma-inducing drugs.
   The child's doctors are ``pleased that she is responding as she
is,'' Humphrey said. ``But they will be evaluating that over the
next few days now that she has regained consciousness.''
   Amy underwent eight hours of surgery last Tuesday to remove the
metal and plastic dart that was stuck 2 inches into her head.
Doctors put her into a coma to keep her brain activity to a minimum
until swelling subsided.
   The child remained in critical condition and doctors planned to
administer tests to determine the amount of brain damage she may
have suffered.
   Amy and some friends were playing with a neighbor's lawn dart
set when the girl bent over to pick up a dart and was struck by
another dart tossed by her cousin, said Sue Tucker, Amy's mother.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted Friday to ban the
sale of lawn darts. Proponents of the ban said the darts have
severely injured about 6,700 people, mostly children under 15, and
resulted in three deaths.
   The ban, which goes into effect in mid-December, requires that
the products no longer be sold, manufactured or imported into the
United States.

   Here is the text of American hostage
Terry Anderson's videotaped message:
   My name is Terry Anderson. And it's October 30.
   Once again I'm being given a chance to speak to my family, to my
friends and to the American people.
   First to my family. I love you and I miss you very much. I know
of your continued strong efforts for me, the work and devotion of
many friends and colleagues and of the many people I don't know,
like (American entertainer) Mr. Hank Williams.
   I know I can never repay you. But I thank you and pray for you
as you do for me.
   I'm well and being well treated. I received your birthday
greetings and as always that helped me very much.
   But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of
my fourth year (in captivity) approaches, I find it difficult to
keep my hopes and my courage high.
   The news I hear tells me that you've not forgotten (me) and I
know you will not. But the difficulty seems enormous.
   I've been very close to being released several times over the
past two years. But each time it seems that the U.S. government
uses its influence to stop any agreement of being made. And I don't
understand this.
   I'm not asking President Reagan to deal with terrorists,
although both he and Mr. Bush did so in the Iran-Contra affair and
the TWA hijack.
   Our problem could have been solved long ago without such
complications as arms deals.
   With the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Lebanese in
Israeli-run prisons, U.S. support of Israel is no different.
   All that is necessary is that Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, if he is
elected, use their influence in a positive way, not a negative one,
with those who are trying to find a way out of this terrible
impasse.
   I gather there's been very little discussion about this problem
in the U.S. presidential campaign and that's disappointing, as is
President Reagan's complete failure to find a solution during his
eight years in office.
   But whichever candidate wins this election, remember an
unyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make it
go away. It is not going to free us.
   I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious effort to
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks
to the Soviet Union for its help. It's a warming story. That kind
of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this
situation to an end.
   Once again, this has gone on too long. It can't continue like
this.
   Peg, Madeleine, Dad, kiss my daughters for me. Keep your spirits
up and I will try to do the same. And one day, soon God willing,
this will end.

   Anti-abortion protests nationwide resulted in the arrests of
more than 2,000 demonstrators who tried to block entrances to
clinics and turn away patients, organizers said.
   Operation Rescue, the New York-based organization that sponsored
the demonstrations, said 2,212 persons were arrested in 27 cities
Saturday and in four cities on Friday.
   Organizers of rallies in Pittsburgh, where 367 were arrested,
and Philadelphia, where 138 werlvania.
   In New Orleans, one woman yelled ``Save your child! Give your
life to Jesus!'' as sheriff's deputies escorted a woman into a
suburban clinic. Among the 203 cited or arrested were several
Protestant ministers and three Roman Catholic priests.
   In Des Moines, Iowa, a Planned Parenthood clinic employee was
slightly injured when protesters, thinking she was a patient, dove
in her path to stop her from entering. Police arrested 20
demonstrators there.
   Clinic Director Jill June said abortions account for only about
5 percent of the clinic's business, and that the rest is birth
control.
   ``We'd like them (protesters) to find a constructive way to help
women not get pregnant in the first place'' she said.
   Operation Rescue began blocking clinic entrances on July 19 in
Atlanta during the Democratic National Convention. About 7,000
sympathizers have been arrested nationwide since then, 1,200 of
them in Atlanta.
   On Saturday, some sympathizers prayed and sang hymns as police
arrested others. Counter-demonstrators chanted, ``Right to Life,
your name's a lie, you don't care if women die,'' and ``Not the
church, not the state, women will decide their fate.''
   Among other cities, arrests were made in Falls Church, Va.; St.
Louis; Jackson, Miss.; Phoenix; Columbus, Ohio; and the North
Carolina cities of Charlotte, Chapel Hill and Raleigh.
   Houston police arrested 11 people at one clinic.
   Nearly 160 people were arrested in New York, Indiana and Florida
on Friday.
   In New York, 133 demonstrators who defied a court order and the
threat of a stiff fine were also arrested Saturday after a loud but
peaceful demonstration on Long Island.
   Demonstrators were generally peaceful, but in Atlanta, where
police arrested 40, a man who tried to stop a police motorcycle
from entering clinic property was handcuffed and arrested.
   In Brookline, Mass., Acting Gov. Evelyn Murphy told a rally of
pro-choice demonstrators that only Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democratic presidential nominee, would protect their right to a
legal abortion.
   ``We must get up and exercise our choice for the candidate who
believes women have a right to control our bodies. George Bush
believes women are criminals,'' she said. Bush is campaigning
against abortion.
   Anti-abortion groups had advertised plans to protest in Boston
on Saturday but instead decided before dawn to move their
demonstration south to Rhode Island.
   In Sunnyvale, Calif., where 60 arrests were reported, police
dragged one man 50 yards on his belly to a police vehicle but most
cities reported gentle arrest tactics and only minimal resistance
by protesters.
   Atlanta police were widely criticized in early October for rough
arrest tactics used on Operation Rescue demonstrators who went limp
and refused to walk to police buses.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There may be an insidious media bias at work
this election year, but it isn't the publishers tilting Republican
or the networks showing an Eastern Establishment slant for the
Democrats. No, it's an anti-ideological prejudice in favor of a
close election.
   Close elections make better stories.
   Close elections make it seem as if the American Democracy is in
some kind of wonderful balance.
   Close elections are fun to cover.
   Close elections give journalists and politicians something to
talk about over drinks after work.
   Journalists _ like gardeners, accountants and electrical
contractors _ tend to pursue their own best interests. If there is
a close race, they like it to stay that way. But if one candidate
moves way ahead of another, journalism can often trigger mysterious
forces that test a front-runner's mettle or encourage the
underdog's heroic comeback effort.
   In races like those for Pennsylvania or Tennessee Senate seats,
there is little anyone can do to boost the fortunes of anonymous
and underfinanced challengers against popular incumbents like John
Heinz III and James Sasser.
   In races for the House of Representatives, where 90-odd percent
of the 435 seats will be won by incumbents, journalism can't even
provide a finger for the dike.
   But the presidential campaign is another matter altogether, and
the bias for a close race has been a subtle dynamic in the titanic
struggle of George Bush and Michael Dukakis, overshadowed
rightfully by the exertions of the candidates themselves and the
volatility of an electorate apparently enamored so far with neither
candidate.
   Today Bush leads the race and the bias for a close election is
benefiting Dukakis. Bush would complain, except that he's benefited
from the same process and might need to again _ say next weekend,
for example. Also, Bush would not like to anger the other
constituency, aside from journalists, who welcome a close race _
voters.
   From a voter's perspective:
   Close elections make for humble and responsive public officials.
   Close elections make it seem as if the American Democracy is in
some kind of wonderful balance.
   Close elections are fun to watch on TV. The ads become
especially entertaining, even if the debates tend to wax
insufferable.
   Close elections make it seem as if every voter counts, even
those on the West Coast.
   The roles of campaign journalism _ to ask tough questions,
describe the character of candidates under pressure, constantly
gauge public interest and reaction _ are consistent with this voter
interest in close elections. Campaign coverage will often:
   _ Raise new and sharply tougher questions about the
front-runner. This happened to Bob Dole during his brief stay atop
the GOP primary race. He won Iowa and sought a New Hampshire
knockout of George Bush. But Bush waged a great comeback campaign,
his forces fanning reporters' questions about the operation of Mrs.
Dole's trust fund. (It didn't hurt that Bush allies controlled the
New Hampshire GOP and he began primary week with a big lead).
   _ Raise the underdog's visibility. This is happening now with
Dukakis, who is deluged with TV invitations and is using the
platform to explain his values to voters who are just now tuning
into the election process.
   Bush, offered the same opportunities, has the most to lose from
TV exposure, and so he's limiting his appearances to the morning
talk shows. If he slips in the polls, he'll change his strategy
before you can say, ``Live from New York, it's Saturday Night.''
   _ Write encouraging things about the dauntless, dignified,
suddenly impassioned comeback kid. Dust off the 1948 Truman
stories, explain how the Electoral College math provides a glimmer
of Election Day hope.
   How can we tell if the presidential election is tightening?
   Journalists now use ``tracking polls'' to identify and publicize
one-day trends in public opinion. If those ubiquitous ``likely
voters'' provide good news for Dukakis _ like they did last
Thursday, for example, journalists and voters will be sensing a
comeback.
   ``We thought from the beginning,'' Bush said Saturday while bus
stopping his way through Illinois, wary of resisting the public
will for a tight campaign, ``that it would be close right up to the
end.''

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor who said he drugged his
cancer-stricken wife so she could end her life with dignity goes on
trial more than two years later for her murder.
   Dr. Peter Rosier, 47, is charged with first-degree murder,
conspiracy to commit murder and attempted first-degree murder. His
trial was scheduled to begin today.
   ``This is something that is done in the medical community all
the time,'' said his attorney, Stanley Rosenblatt. ``Doctors assist
their terminally ill patients who want to die, and everybody just
winks at it.
   ``To put him in the same category as an organized crime figure
or someone who robs a 7-Eleven in the middle of the night is
absurd.''
   Rosenblatt said he would call doctors and mercy-killing experts
to testify for the defense.
   Rosier is accused of giving his 43-year-old wife, Patricia
Rosier, a 6-milligram morphine injection and 80-milligram morphine
suppository on Jan. 5, 1986. Rosier says his wife also took 20
tablets of Seconal, a sleeping pill, which he didn't administer.
   Steve Wisotsky, a Nova University law professor assisting the
defense, said the drugs the doctor gave to his wife weren't enough
to kill her.
   After the drugs were administered, Mrs. Rosier lay near death
for hours and her stepfather, Vincent Delham, finished the effort
by suffocating her, according to court records.
   Delham and his two sons, who said they were in the room, have
been granted immunity from prosecution and are expected to be
state's witnesses.
   Rosier immediately opened himself to suspicion by going on Fort
Myers television station WBBH in November 1986 to talk about his
641-page book ``The Lady.'' It was about his and his wife's lives,
and her death.
   Rosier, a retired pathologist, may have exhibited ``colossal
stupidity'' by going public with the act, but that doesn't make him
a murderer, Rosenblatt said.
   Wisotsky said Mrs. Rosier had a constitutional right to die with
dignity, but prosecutor Ed Volz has asked Lee County Circuit Judge
James Thompson to prohibit any discussion of euthanasia and
morality.
   ``Philosophy, ethics, morality will confuse the jury and they
will not be able to reach an acceptable verdict based on the law,''
Volz said.

<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda was sworn in for
a sixth five-year term today after capturing 95 percent of ballots
in elections at which he was sole presidential candidate.
   Hundreds of supporters cheered and sang as Kaunda, 64, arrived
at the High Court for the ceremony.
   Kaunda told them their votes had given him ``marching orders''
to resolve Zambia's economic woes, including record inflation,
unprecedented unemployment and a foreign debt of $5 billion.
   ``We are likely to face even more and greater problems over the
next five years,'' said Kaunda. ``But I am confident that we shall
pull through.''
   To stay in power, the Zambian leader needed a simple majority of
ballots cast by voters who were asked specifically to vote for or
against him.
   Only 4.5 percent of those who went to polls last Wednesday voted
against him.
   Officials said 56 percent of 2.6 million registered voters took
part.
   Kaunda was nominated by the United National Independent Party,
the country's only legal political movement since he declared
Zambia a one-party state in 1972.
   He is expected to name his 24-member Cabinet on Wednesday, aides
said. Four Cabinet ministers and two ministers of state were
rejected at the polls, reflecting popular hostility toward official
mismanagement and corruption.
   Kaunda led the British colony of Northern Rhodesia to
independence as Zambia on Oct. 24, 1964.

   An offshore earthquake rattled Algiers
and surrounding towns this morning, wrecking a school and injuring
at least 10 children, officials said.
   Preliminary information indicated the quake, which struck at
11:14 a.m., measured 5.4 on the Richter scale, Algeria's Center for
Research in Astronomy, Astrophysics and Geophysics said in a
statement. The epicenter was put about 30 miles north of the
capital in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The earthquake lasted about 10 seconds, and Algerians
immediately ran into the streets from cafes and office buildings.
   At least 10 children were injured in the town of El Affroun, 30
miles outside the capital, when the roof of their school fell in,
officials said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage
in populated areas.

<HEAD>First U.S. Warship To Leave Persian Gulf Since Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States plans to withdraw its
first warship from the Persian Gulf this week, a small but
important step that reflects confidence in the Iraq-Iran
cease-fire, U.S. sources say.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that
barring a last-minute change in plans the missile frigate USS
Rodney M. Davis was to be detached from duty Tuesday and sail for
home port in Yokosuka, Japan.
   The 3,600-ton frigate would be the first U.S. warship pulled out
of the gulf since Iraq and Iran agreed to an Aug. 20 cease-fire in
their eight-year war.
   The ship's departure would trim overall American naval strength
in the region to 25 vessels. The Pentagon says the gulf force will
gradually be scaled back to a pre-war level of about five ships if
the cease-fire stays in effect.
   Since the truce, no flareups have been reported in the waterway,
where more than 500 commercial ships were damaged by air and
gunboat attacks related to the war.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Mike Stepp refused
comment, citing a Defense Department policy of not discussing ship
movements or locations for security reasons.
   U.S. warships are regularly rotated on a six-month basis, with
about three months on duty in the gulf. The Rodney M. Davis arrived
Sept. 9 and was to have left in January.
   The fleet dropped to 26 ships when the missile cruiser USS
Vincennes left the Arabian Sea on Sept. 5. The sailing orders of
its designated replacement, the USS Mobile Bay, were canceled a day
before it was to leave the United States.
   In other moves toward reducing the U.S. presence, officials
ended 17 months of close escort of U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil
tankers, curtailed regional air surveillance and took a fortified
barge off station in the northern gulf.
   The Navy squadron inside the gulf, normally about 16 ships,
includes six mine-sweepers, an amphibious landing ship, and the
flagship USS La Salle. There are also two missile cruisers, one
missile destroyer, and four frigates besides the Rodney M. Davis.
   The missile cruiser USS Reeves and missile frigate USS
Vandegrift also are scheduled to leave in the next week but will be
replaced, the sources said.

   Two Moscow dissidents were jailed for their part
in protests demanding freedom for hundreds of people they say are
political prisoners, a dissident source said today.
   Yuri Mityunov said police arrested Valeriya Novodvorskaya and
Dmitri Starikov on Sunday and they were given 15-day jail
sentences. Mityunov is a spokesman for the Democratic Union, a
group that bills itself as an alternative to the Communist Party.
   At least 50 people were arrested as hundreds of demonstrators
marked an imprisoned poet's death by protests demanding the release
of hundreds they say are political prisoners, Mityunov said.
   About 40 people were arrested in Leningrad, 14 in Moscow, and
four in Novosibirsk, Mityunov said.
   A few thousand people gathered separately in Minsk, capital of
the Byelorussian Republic, to commemorate the victims of Hitler and
Stalin. Fourteen people were arrested there, Mityunov said.
   Ms. Novodvorskaya was arrested on her way to a planned
demonstration on Moscow's Pushkin Square along with several other
Democratic Union leaders.
   A crowd of several hundred people gathered on the square in the
cold and snow Sunday evening, but no protest took place. Starikov
was arrested when he raised a banner demanding freedom for
political prisoners after most of the crowd left, Mityunov said.
   Earlier Sunday, five members of another group were arrested on
the square for their brief protest.
   Mityunov said 200-300 people gathered to read poetry and hold
candles along Leningrad's Nevsky Prospket near Kazan Cathedral. At
least 40 of them were arrested, he said.
   A crowd of several thousand gathered near the police station
where they were taken, shouting angry slogans, he said.
   A Leningrad dissident source said all but 10 of those arrested
were freed by Monday.
   Sunday was the 16th anniversary of the death in a labor camp of
Yuri Galanskov, a poet and pacifist who was an editor of the
dissident journal Phoenix 66. He was sentenced to seven years in a
labor camp in 1968.
   Sunday's protests came just days after Soviet officials
reportedly promised West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that they
would release within 10 weeks all those regarded by the West as
political prisoners.
   The Soviet Union says it has only a few dozen political
prisoners. But many Western human rights groups and Soviet
dissident organizations say several hundred people still are held
in prisons, labor camps, psychiatric hospitals, or in internal
exile, because of their beliefs.

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma said today it will end 26 years of
economic isolationism and a rigidly controlled domestic economy and
open its doors to foreign investment.
   There was no indication the government of Gen. Saw Maung, who
seized power Sept. 18, would become liberal politically.
   ``Burma will practice a market-oriented trade policy in line
with the world economic trend, both in domestic and foreign
trade,'' Trade Minister Col. Abel told a news briefing.
   Abel said laws that would provide a favorable investment climate
were being drafted and welcomed queries from both domestic and
foreign investors on the new policies.
   He said items such as teak, petroleum and gems would remain
under government monopoly but private enterprises could become
involved in all other sectors of the economy.
   He said foreign investment would be permitted either directly or
through joint ventures with the government or local private
enterprises.
   But Abel said there were no plans to change the current official
exchange rate of six kyats to one dollar. Under this rate, private
exporters often receive less from their transaction than the cost
of the export commodity. The black market rate has soared to more
than 40 kyats to the dollar recently.
   Burma's economy spiraled downward last year and the country,
according to experts, is virtually bankrupt following months of
political unheaval and a freeze on aid by Japan, West Germany, the
United States and other donors.
   The international community has condemned the military
government for suppression of popular dissent which began late July
following the retirement of Ne Win.
   Ne Win, who seized power in a 1962 military coup, imposed a
centrally directed economy and banned all private foreign
investment. Under his authoritarian rule, one of Asia's potentially
richest nations became among the world's poorest with an annual per
capita income currently estimated at below $150.
   Reaction from foreign investors to the plans Abel spelled out
was expected to be cautious, given the potentially chaotic
political situation and Burma's earlier backtracking on promises of
economic reform.
   Since late July thousands have been killed by an authoritarian
regime trying to maintain its power in face of nationwide protest.
Saw Maung has allowed the formation of political parties and
promised a general election but opposition leaders are skeptical
that a free and fair election can be held while the military wield
power.
   The minister said cross border trade was opened at two points
with China recently and similar arrangements were expected to
follow along Burma's frontiers with Bangladesh, India and Thailand.
   In the past, the government has lost vast revenues because it
was unable to control smuggling across the country's frontiers. The
border with Thailand, across which most commodities enter Burma, is
largely controlled by ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting the
central government.

   Laurence Olivier, celebrated as
Britain's greatest actor, has been admitted to a hospital with an
undisclosed illness, the hospital reported today.
   The 81-year-old stage and screen actor was in ``comfortable and
stable'' condition at Royal Sussex County Hospital in the south
England resort of Brighton, a spokeswoman said.
   She said Lord Olivier's family had asked the hospital not to
reveal any details of his illness and ``we have got to respect the
wishes of the family.'' He was admitted to the hospital during the
weekend, she said. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Olivier has suffered from cancer, pleurisy and a degenerative
muscle disease. He was quoted in a magazine interview last year as
saying he had fought off illnesses by ``sheer bloody-mindedness.''
   ``You need anger to see you through,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Fernald Workers Report Regular Uranium Exposure, Report Saysa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half of the long-term workers at the
Fernald uranium processing plant say they've been exposed to
uranium frequently over the years, a newspaper reported.
   The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Sunday that a federal study
found a close relationship between workers' reports of exposure to
uranium and medical problems, including shortness of breath.
   The report was the latest in a series of revelations of problems
at the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald, a small town
north of Cincinnati, and at other federal nuclear weapons plants.
The plant, owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, processes
uranium for weapons.
   The study was requested by one of the unions that represent
Fernald workers. It was performed by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati.
   The Enquirer said an interim report dated July 1987 found that
some workers were so severely affected that they could not walk
short distances without stopping for breath.
   The study was limited to workers who had been employed at the
Fernald plant for more than 10 years. Of the 208 such employees,
146 agreed to participate in the study. They had worked at the
plant an average of 32 years.
   The Enquirer said 93 of the 146 workers estimated that they had
been regularly or frequently exposed to uranium. Forty-nine had
been exposed at least 10 times, while 38 workers said they were
exposed at least 20 times.
   Even after accounting for cigarette smoking, 32 percent of the
workers had shortness of breath, the study found, including nine
workers who could not walk more than 100 yards without stopping to
breathe heavily. One-fourth of the workers had restricted or
obstructed lung functions.
   The study was requested by the International Association of
Machinists, which represents 625 of the plant's 1,500 full-time
workers. The plant's unions are on strike, citing safety and health
concerns as well as wage and benefit disagreements. Production at
the plant has been stopped since Oct. 7.
   David Day, president of Fernald's Machinists local, said the
NIOSH report is being reviewed by the unions.
   ``It's difficult to know who to trust,'' Day said. ``Right now
we do trust NIOSH.''
   Dr. Mitchell Singal of NIOSH, who prepared the study, said the
federal institute is still researching the working environment at
the plant, but has closed its investigation into medical effects on
workers.
   ``There were some additional analyses done'' after the interim
study was completed in 1987, ``but those analyses didn't change the
initial conclusions,'' Singal told the Enquirer.
   James Reafsnyder, Energy Department site representative at
Fernald, said over the weekend that he was not familiar with the
study results.

<HEAD>Book Faults North Carolina Authorities in Case That Left Nine Dead</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 16th graf, `On June...', to add ages of dead boys.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In July 1984, a wealthy matron and her
daughter were shot to death at their sprawling home northeast of
Louisville. In May 1985, three members of a well-to-do
Winston-Salem, N.C., family were found slain.
   Two sets of killings, months and miles apart, but tied together
by a tale of failed marriage, an incestuous relationship and a
bitter child custody battle. When authorities finally caught up
with the suspects, they committed suicide in a car explosion after
killing the two boys at the center of the custody dispute.
   The story was apparent to investigators in retrospect; according
to a new book, it could have become apparent much sooner, before
the second set of killings, but for the mistakes of North Carolina
authorities.
   ``Bitter Blood,'' by Greensboro (N.C.) News & Record reporter
Jerry Bledsoe, looks at the slayings of Delores Rodgers Lynch, 68,
and her daughter, Dr. Jane Lynch, 39, of Prospect, Ky., and the
aftermath.
   Mrs. Lynch also had a son, Thomas J. Lynch, a dentist in
Albuquerque, N.M. He had been married from 1970 to 1981 to North
Carolina native Susie Newsom.
   As part of his investigation into the Lynches' slayings, Dan
Davidson, then an investigator for the Kentucky State Police,
requested a check on Susie Lynch from the North Carolina State
Bureau of Investigation. The check showed that a camping trailer
was jointly registered to her and a Frederick Klenner, 32.
   Davidson then sought a check on Klenner and was told that he was
a doctor with no criminal record.
   An apparent dead end.
   But Klenner, who was Susie Lynch's first cousin, was not what he
appeared to be. Despite a widespread belief among people in his
hometown of Reidsville, N.C., that he was a physician, he had never
attended medical school. At least one person knew that and had
complained to authorities, who compiled a detailed file on him,
according to the book.
   In the file, a State Bureau of Investigation agent described
Klenner as a survivalist ``gun nut.'' According to the file,
Klenner was ``paranoid and spent all of his money on exotic
military weapons that he carried wherever he went.''
   Had Davidson been given this file by North Carolina authorities,
he would have focused on Klenner immediately, according to ``Bitter
Blood.'' Davidson agrees.
   North Carolina SBI officials refused to talk to Bledsoe for his
book, and the bureau in Raleigh recently declined to comment to The
Associated Press.
   After the Lynch killings, 10 months of fruitless investigation
passed. Then, on May 18, 1985, Susie Lynch's parents, Robert W.
Newsom Jr. and Florence Sharp Newsom, and her grandmother, Hattie
C. Newsom, were shot dead.
   With the second set of slayings, the family tie became clear.
All five victims, apparently upset by Klenner's courtship of Susie
Lynch, had planned to testify against her at a hearing that summer
over the custody of her sons. Both families were wealthy, and a
desire for the inheritances may have played a role as well,
investigators said at the time.
   But the real motive will never be known. By early June,
authorities had decided to arrest Klenner on murder charges in the
Newsom family slayings because he was planning to leave the state
and had threatened witnesses, they said.
   On June 4, they caught up with his van and began a chase. With
Klenner was Susie Lynch and the two boys. As police closed in, the
van exploded. Klenner and his lover were killed by the explosion;
authorities discovered that the boys, ages 8 and 10, already had
been killed _ poisoned with cyanide and shot in the head.
   Davidson said Klenner had to have detonated the bomb, and
authorities believe Susie Lynch knew of all the slayings and died
willingly as well.
   After the explosion, Davidson and his investigators returned to
Kentucky to finish their investigation of the Oldham County
killings.
   Davidson got phone records that led him to the gun store in
Winston-Salem where Klenner did most of his trading. He found that
Klenner had traded a rifle _ the same type of weapon used to kill
the Lynches _ to that dealer the day after the killings. Ballistics
tests linked a bullet found at the Lynch home to the gun.
   Three months after the explosion, an Oldham County grand jury
found that Klenner and Susie Lynch were responsible for the Lynch
killings.
   ``I wanted to be able to tell the people ... that there wasn't a
killer in their midst, and I wanted to be sure about what I was
telling them,'' Davidson said.

<TEXT>
   A sea lion apparently suffering from a
liver and kidney disease attacked a swimmer and a beach stroller
over the weekend, prompting authorities to issue their first-ever
sea lion warning.
   ``We've never even heard of something like that, where a sea
lion would actually attack somebody swimming,'' said Mary Jane
Schramm, director of public relations for the Marine Mammal Center.
``In the water, the animal typically feels it has nothing to fear
from a human.''
   The center warned swimmers plying the chilly waters of San
Francisco Bay to avoid all sea lions.
   A swimmer was bitten off Aquatic Park in San Francisco on
Saturday. The sea lion ``just swam up to the poor guy and
gratuitously bit him on the side of the chest and on the foot,''
Schramm said.
   The unidentified swimmer was admitted to a hospital and received
``the normal animal-bite treatment,'' Schramm said.
   The same day, the sea lion attacked a woman who was walking on
the beach off Crissy Field a few miles from where the swimmer was
attacked, Schramm said. The woman thought the animal was sick and
wanted to help.
   ``She meant well, but she got bit because she placed herself
right between the animal and where he wanted to go _ the beach,''
she said.
   The sea lion, which weighs between 60 and 80 pounds, has two red
tags on its flippers, meaning it was born near the Channel Islands
off Santa Barbara.
   Schramm speculated that the sea lion was suffering from a
disease called Leptospirosis, an often fatal sickness of the liver
and kidney.
   Three rescue teams searched for the sea lion over the weeked but
were unsuccessful.

   Israeli leaders today vowed
to avenge the deaths of a Jewish woman and her three sons in the
firebombing of a bus. The army said the Palestinian attackers were
in custody, and there were reports two had confessed.
   The attack in this West Bank town came 35 hours before Israel's
parliamentary elections. It could drive undecided voters to the
Likud bloc of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has advocated a
hard line in dealing with violence.
   In newspaper interviews published today, Shamir and his rival,
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, promised revenge for Sunday's attack.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin asked the army's chief prosecutor
to investigate whether the death penalty could be used against the
assailants, calling them ``murderers of women and children who have
lost all shades of humanity,'' Israel radio reported.
   The radio said the army rounded up dozens of Palestinians in
Jericho. It said two suspects in custody admitted taking part in
the attack.
   In Jerusalem today, more than 1,000 mourners attended a funeral
for the victim, 27-year-old Rachel Weiss, and her sons, Rafael,
Netanel and Efraim, aged 9 months to 3{ years. Many mourners wept
and wore the traditional black clothes of Orthodox Jews. A banner
stetched across the street said ``Oh what has befallen us?''
   Mrs. Weiss, her husband and her sons lived in Jerusalem and were
returning home from northern Israel at the time of the attack on
the bus. The husband escaped without serious injury, army officials
said.
   Five other bus passengers were injured in the attac, one a
soldier who was seriously burned.
   Two of those injured are immigrants from Pittsburgh: Dov Blum,
35, who suffered serious burns on his face, and his wife, Cindy,
burned on her face and back, said Ruth Mekel of Hadassah Hospital
in Jerusalem.
   The attack claimed the largest number of Israeli lives in a
single assault since the Palestinian revolt against Israel's
21-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip broke out almost
11 months ago.
   A total of 305 Palestinians and 10 Israelis have been killed in
the uprising, which began Dec. 8.
   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, the West Bank commander, told reporters
in Jericho today that a curfew was imposed on the town of about
17,000 Arabs 18 miles east of Jerusalem.
   The attackers tossed the firebombs from a banana plantation next
to the road. As reporters watched today, an army bulldozer plowed
under rows of banana trees to prevent future ambushes.
   Soldiers, some using police dogs, searched door to door.
   Officers said the attack was meticulously planned, but Mitzna
played down a connection with the elections: ``The timing is just
two days before the election, but it is not the first time that
firebombs were thrown on (West Bank) roads.''
   In the past two months, there have been more than 100 firebomb
attacks in the Jericho area, Israel radio said.
   Mitzna said firebombs were hurled at the bus by Palestinians at
about 8:15 p.m. One broke through a window, setting afire the back
seat where the children were sitting.
   ``Two or three Molotov cocktails were thrown at the bus, which
went up in flames in seconds,'' Mitzna said.
   The driver slammed on the brakes, and most of the 22 passengers
scrambled to safety. A soldier, identified only as Sgt. Ron,
boarded the red-and-white Egged bus No. 961 and found a woman still
aboard.
   ``From the back of the bus I heard the sound of a trapped
woman,'' Ron said on Israel radio. ``I grabbed her with one hand. I
said, `Come out with me.' She absolutely refused.''
   ``She screamed, `But I have a baby, what about the baby!' After
a few seconds, I realized that if I remained one more second (I
would be killed).''
   Capt. Avi, who arrived moments after the bus caught fire, told
reporters the woman apparently panicked and feared leaving the bus
because she thought terrorists were outside.
   Reporters were kept away from the scene until dawn and the bus
was gone by the time photographers arrived. However, one witness
said the bus was consumed by fire, its tires melted into the
asphalt.
   Speaking on Israel radio, Shamir said he did not think the
attack was linked to the elections, saying there was no logic to
such acts of hatred.
   ``I am sure the security forces will reach the murderers,'' he
said. ``I hope the murderers and those who sent them and their
supporters will feel the serious consequences to them and their
surroundings of their heinous hatred towards us.''
   But Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, at an election rally in
southern Israel, accused Israeli liberals of creating an atmosphere
for such attacks, by saying: ``All talk of withdrawal or pullbacks
brings more and more firebomb attacks,'' newspapers reported.
   Shamir was quoted as telling the Hadashot daily: ``This
despicable act in Jericho deserves an appropriate response that
will prove to the murderers they will be punished to the full
extent of the law.''
   Peres was quoted by the national news agency Itim as saying
Israel was united into ``one family'' by such attacks.
   ``Neither terrorism nor violence will determine our path. We
will determine our path,'' he said. ``Deeds such as tonight's tear
at the heart and provide nothing in the way of hope for a
solution.''

   A South Korean fishing boat capsized in rough seas
in the Pacific Ocean off Japan today and maritime authorities
reported all 27 crew members were missing.
   An official of the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard,
said the the No. 35 Sang Young Ho fishing vessel sank just after
midnight about 600 miles off the northeast coast of Japan.
   The crew, who abandoned the 290-ton ship before it sank, radioed
they were drifting in two rubber boats, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said coast guard and military planes searched the area and
found two empty dinghies.
   Japanese patrol boats were expected to reach the area where the
fishing boat sank by Tuesday, the official said.
   He said the No. 35 Sang Young Ho was fishing with six other
South Korean boats when it capsized.

   A 32-year-old schoolteacher today admitted
shooting Premier Turgut Ozal as he delivered a speech four months
ago.
   Kartal Demirag said he was sorry as he put in a guilty plea at
the start of his trial.
   ``I ask him (Ozal) to forgive me,'' Demirag told the court.
   He fired at Ozal twice while the premier addressed his
Motherland Party's general convention.
   One shot hit the microphone in front of Ozal. The other hit his
right thumb. Bodyguards returned the fire, wounding Demirag and 20
other people. The teacher was captured at the scene.
   Prosecutor Tevfik Hancilar charged Demirag with attempting
premeditated murder, carrying an unlicensed weapon and using a
false identity. The prosecutor demanded the gunman get a 20-year
jail term.
   Demirag had been serving a 10-year sentence for knifing a man in
a coffeehouse brawl last year, but escaped from prison in January.
   He said he nursed a grudge against Ozal because the Turkish
leader did not declare a general amnesty while he was in prison.
   The prosecutor claimed Demirag held neo-fascist views.
   Turkish newspapers reported Demirag was a member of a youth
organization known as the Gray Wolves, from the defunct neo-fascist
National Movement Party.
   Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot and wounded Pope
John Paul II in 1981, allegedly belonged to the Gray Wolves.
   No date was set for the next session of Demirag's trial.

<HEAD>Court Kills Lawsuit Stemming From Japanese-American Internments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today killed a lawsuit
against the government stemming from the World War II mass
detention of Japanese-Americans in U.S. prison camps.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that the
veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit
seeking compensation for property losses.
   Congress and the Reagan administration this year officially
acknowledged that the Japanese-Americans were treated unjustly.
   President Reagan signed legislation on Aug. 10 that provides a
$20,000 tax-free payment to each of some 60,000 survivors among the
120,000 U.S. citizens and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry who
were placed in the camps.
   Noting that the detainees were forced to leave their homes and
placed in concentration camps for up to four years, Reagan said the
reparations had ``less to do with property than with honor.''
   The bill calls for a $1.2 billion fund, with appropriations in
any one year to be no more than $500 million.
   But the new law did not make the case acted on today by the
Supreme Court a dead issue. The legislation allowed anyone who does
not seek reparations from the fund to pursue the lawsuit.
   The Reagan administration opposed the suit on grounds the
statute of limitations, or deadline, for filing such court claims
has long since passed.
   The detainees argued the deadline should be suspended because
the government's deception in concealing the real reason for the
internment _ racism rather than military necessity _ was not
exposed until decades after the war ended. They said the Supreme
Court itself was deceived in 1944 when it upheld the internment
program.
   The administration said the high court was not hoodwinked.
Justice Department lawyers said the government based the internment
policy on its belief that ``ancestral, cultural and ethnic
considerations'' made it likely those of Japanese ancestry would
engage in subversive activity.
   In the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the
government forcibly removed from their homes those of Japanese
ancestry living in California, Oregon, Washington state and Arizona.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the internment,
acting on advice by military leaders that people of Japanese
descent could not be trusted.
   The Supreme Court's 1944 ruling upheld the internment program as
a constitutionally acceptable military necessity.
   By the mid-1970s, government documents were discovered that
indicated there was no such military necessity.
   Then, 19 survivors and descendants of those interned filed suit
in 1983 in behalf of all 120,000.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
ruled in 1986 that the government must defend itself at trial
against the suit.
   But the Supreme Court in June 1987 said the appeals court did
not have authority over the case and sent it instead to a different
court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That
appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling last May, said the suit was barred
by the statute of limitations.
   The deadline question had not been addressed by the Supreme
Court when the justices issued their ruling last year.
   The case is Hohri vs. U.S., 88-215.

   Gang-related violence killed two 17-year-olds
and wounded at least 13, including a toddler who was shot in the
head, after 200 police officers conducted an anti-gang sweep of the
area.
   Police said 15-month-old Dalafayette Polk was struck in the head
by a shotgun blast Sunday night during a drive-by attack on a
birthday party in the Watts section of Los Angeles. The boy was in
critical condition today at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical
Center, said nursing supervisor Sarah Patterson.
   The boy's mother, Sheila Williams, was in good condition with a
gunshot wound to the foot, said Patterson. Eight others were
wounded in the attack.
   The shooters shouted gang slogans as they drove by and opened
fire, but the people attending the party apparently were not gang
members, said Lt. O.L. Johnson. The motive for the attack was
unknown and there were no arrests.
   ``We were across the street at a birthday party and heard shots
and smelled burned rubber,'' said neighbor Shyolanda Montana, 12.
``Everybody was just starting to leave when they got shot.''
   The shooting occurred 16 hours after 200 police officers ended a
two-night, anti-gang sweep, arresting 365 people, including 193
reputed gang members, said Officer Richard Dugerian. The offenses
included driving under the influence, curfew violations and
outstanding felony and misdemeanor warrants.
   In nearby Long Beach, 17-year-old Danny Romero was gunned down
Sunday night after neighbors had repeatedly called police to report
gang trouble brewing.
   Neighbors said gang problems have grown worse in the
neighborhood in the past months because of a turf war. Resident
Barney Hellman said Sunday night's trouble began when 15 youngsters
began throwing bottles at cars.
   Long Beach police Sgt. Robert Hohl confirmed that police
received several calls about the disturbance, but added that
reports of bottles being thrown would not be considered a high
priority for police.
   Also Sunday, 17-year-old Louis Orellana was shot and killed by
rival gang members while he was walking with friends in Hollywood,
said Detective Andy Monsue. No arrests were made.
   On Saturday, three officers answering a report of a shooting
outside a party attended by gang members came upon a man allegedly
firing at a teen-ager, said Detective Sid Nuckles. The gunman
ignored orders to stop shooting and drop his weapon, and the three
officers fired 28 shots, striking him four times, said Nuckles.
   The gunman was in serious condition at Los Angeles County-USC
Medical Center and the teen-ager was treated for a minor gunshot
wound.
   In another shooting, two men shouting gang slogans from a car
fired at least six times with a pistol and a shotgun at a reputed
gang member and a woman in the city's southside early Sunday,
police said.
   The woman was taken to Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical
Center with a shotgun wound to the abdomen, said Officer Charles
Walton.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Issue on Lawyers for Indigent Death Row Inmates in
Virginia Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states must continue to provide lawyers for indigent death
row inmates after they have lost their initial round of appeals.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Virginia officials who
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead
to interminable delays in carrying out executions.
   The justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 6-4 ruling last
June, said condemned murderers in Virginia who cannot afford a
lawyer are entitled to greater representation at taxpayer expense
than the state provides.
   Attorneys are provided by the state when a death row inmate
files an initial appeal in state courts.
   Convicted killers who lose that round may pursue a second round
of appeals in state courts, contending that their rights were
violated. But they are not entitled to free legal representation
during this second phase if they are unable to afford their own
lawyer.
   Like other states, Virginia provides prison law libraries and
assigns part-time lawyers to help inmates prepare their
second-round _ or collateral _ appeals. In some cases, volunteer
lawyers are available to help the prisoners.
   But the 4th Circuit court said the Constitution requires more in
the case of those on death row.
   ``The complexity and difficulty of the legal work involved in
challenging a death penalty require particular safeguards in order
to insure meaningful access'' to justice, the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also noted that inmates facing execution are
likely to be emotionally incapable of preparing a cogent appeal.
   But the appeals court said death row inmates are not entitled to
free legal help for a third round of appeals _ when they take their
cases to federal court to claim their rights were violated.
   By the time the case reaches the federal courts, the appeals
court said, the inmates will have legal briefs, trial transcripts
and state court opinions from earlier state court appeals that will
enable them to prepare their own defense effectively.
   Virginia officials said the 4th Circuit court ruling ``injects a
palpable danger of infinite delay'' in resolving capital cases.
   The added guarantee of free legal representation will give death
row inmates another opportunity to contend that they received
ineffective assistance from their lawyers, the officials said. That
could lead to another protracted round of appeals, they continued.
   The officials also said that most states with capital punishment
do not guarantee free legal help beyond the first round of appeals.
   The state attorney general's office interpreted a 1987 Supreme
Court ruling to mean that the Constitution does not guarantee a
right to a lawyer in collateral appeals.
   In the 1987 case, the justices ruled that a Pennsylvania woman's
constitutional right to adequate legal help had not been violated
during an earlier appeal. She claimed she was denied effective
representation when her court-appointed lawyer concluded that her
collateral appeal was fruitless.
   The 4th Circuit court said the 1987 ruling did not answer the
constitutional question raised in the Virginia case, particularly
since the Pennsylvania case did not involve the death penalty.
   The case is Murray vs. Giarratano, 88-411.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that a state may ban the possession of child pornography.
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, rejected an appeal by
an Illinois couple who say state officials are intruding into the
privacy of the home to impose censorship.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul
Stevens voted to hear arguments in the case, one vote shy of the
four needed to grant such review.
   The couple, John and Charlene Geever of Bartlett, Ill., are
awaiting trial on a 19-count indictment handed up by a state grand
jury in 1985.
   While the Geevers also were accused of soliciting a child to
appear in a pornographic video and taking indecent liberties with a
child, 12 of the counts deal solely with possession of pornographic
material.
   The state law provides a penalty of up to three years in prison
and a $25,000 fine for possession of child pornography.
   The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in March that outlawing
possession of sexually explicit and lewd material depicting
children under 18 does not violate the Constitution.
   ``The purpose of the statute ... is not to limit the indvidual's
freedom of thought and mind in his own home, nor is its purpose to
regulate the moral content of the depictions described,'' the state
court said. ``The purpose is to prevent the sexual abuse and
exploitation of children by drying up the market for child
pornography.''
   The state court said state officials have a compelling interest
in protecting children ``from the lasting harm of emotional and
sexual degradation.''
   At least 11 other states have made it a crime to possess child
pornography. They are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Nevada,
Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1969 that states may not forbid
the mere possession of obscene material. The justices based that
ruling on constitutional guarantees of free expression and on ``the
right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from
unwanted governmental intrusions into one's privacy.''
   The high court also has held, in 1982, that states may ban the
sale and dissemination of child pornography, even if the material
is not legally obscene.
   That ruling said fighting sexual exploitation of children is ``a
government objective of surpassing importance.''
   Since 1973, the court has defined materials as obscene _ and
therefore unprotected by constitutionally guaranteed freedoms _ if
they ``appeal to the prurient interest in sex ... portray sexual
conduct in a patently offensive way, or when taken as a whole do
not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.''
   The 1982 decision held that material depicting sexual activity
by children does not have to meet that standard to be subject to
criminal laws against distribution.
   The case is Geever vs. Illinois, 88-381.

   Four people who underwent liver
transplants after eating poisonous ``death cap'' mushrooms were
showing signs of improvement, hospital officials said today.
   In addition, a fifth person who ate the wild mushrooms they had
picked along the Columbia River was in fair condition at Bess
Kaiser Hospital. John Duncan, 41, was the only victim whose liver
was not destroyed by the poison.
   The five ate the Amanita phalloides mushrooms, which resemble a
safe species found in Asia, in a stir-fry dish on Oct. 22. The
poisons in the mushroom can damage the liver, kidneys and
gastrointestinal system.
   Duncan's wife, Teresa Ok Hui Duncan, 43, of Portland, was in
critical condition at Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital, a
hospital spokeswoman said. Isun Pak, 52, of Hillsboro was in
serious condition at the hospital.
   Pak's son, Andy Clark, 33, was upgraded Sunday from critical to
serious condition at the University of California, San Francisco
Medical Center, said Dr. Jack Lake, coordinator of the liver
transplant program.
   Glenda Sabolyk, 41, of Clackamas was in serious condition at the
same hospital. She was moved from intensive care to a regular floor
and was improving, Lake said.
   Sabolyk underwent surgery Thursday. Pak had surgery Friday, and
the operations of Clark and Mrs. Duncan ended Saturday.

<TEXT>
   An Afghan guerrilla leader today
announced plans to form an all-rebel government in Afghanistan and
said he hoped elections could be held by January.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-member guerrilla
alliance, outlined a plan under which Afghans inside Afghanistan
and refugees outside the country would elect a 400-member
Parliament.
   The Parliament would elect a head of state and approve a
Cabinet, Rabbani said.
   The Pakistan-based guerrillas, or mujahedeen, announced similar
plans in the spring, but they didn't materialize _ reportedly
because of guerrilla infighting.
   ``As the mujahedeen have been successful on the battlefield, we
can also be successful in the peace process,'' he told reporters in
the Pakistani capital.
   Rabbani said the seven leaders of the guerrilla alliance
unanimously adopted the plan.
   Rabbani said he and representatives of the six other guerrilla
groups were leaving for New York later to attend talks at the
United Nations on the war. The U.N. General Assembly takes up the
Afghanistan issue this week.
   Afghan President Najib called for an emergency meeting of the
U.N. Security Council to discuss the Afghan war, especially
allegations that Pakistan is violating an accord by allowing
guerrillas to receive U.S. aid through Pakistani territory.
   The U.N.-mediated accord calls for the Soviet Union to withdraw
its troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. It was signed in April in
Geneva.
   The Red Army intervened in the Afghan conflict in December 1979
to replace one Marxist government with another. It remained to help
the government fight the guerrillas.
   Although the agreement includes a pledge by Islamabad and
Washington not to interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs, the
United States and Soviet Union also agreed to continue arming their
respective clients in the war until the other side stops.
   Rabbani his call for direct talks with Moscow. ``We remind the
Russians that if they want peace, they must recognize the reality
that the only solution is direct talks with the mujahedeen,'' he
said.

   The 58-year-old justice took her seat with fellow justices when
the court convened after a two-week recess.
   O'Connor reportedly underwent a mastectomy, removal of the

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Disturb Ban on Dial-a-Porn in New York Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, for the second time in six
months, today refused to disturb a ban on sexually explicit
telephone dial-up message services dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that such bans
violate free-speech rights.
   Today's action in a case from New York City sets no national
precedent, and challenges to a new federal law banning all
dial-a-porn services are expected to reach the high court soon.
   Such services have been available to callers through 976 numbers
and AT&T's 900 long-distance lines.
   The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other,
non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time
checks and stock market and weather reports.
   In the appeal acted on today, a group of dial-a-porn companies
challenged an older, less restrictive version of the federal law
that banned making ``any obscene or indecent communication by means
of a telephone for commercial purposes to any person under 18 years
of age.''
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last January upheld the
federal law as it applies to obscene material. But the appeals
court said the law cannot be enforced against merely sexually
explicit material not deemed to be legally obscene.
   A federal trial judge in Los Angeles issued a similar decision
last July 19 when ruling on a challenge to a dial-a-porn law
enacted by Congress and signed by President Reagan on July 1.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled that the new law
may be applied to obscene material but not to merely indecent
material.
   The new law bans all dial-a-porn services _ offered to adults as
well as to children.
   American Civil Liberties Union lawyers say the law is
unconstitutional. They support providing means of having the
services available only to those who want them.
   The Reagan administration appealed Tashima's ruling _ that
portion blocking the law's enforcement against indecent but not
obscene telephone messages _ directly to the Supreme Court. The
appeal is pending before the justices.
   The court last April let stand a ban on dial-a-porn message
service in Arizona.
   In the New York case acted on today, lawyers for various
dial-a-porn companies argued, among other things, that the
since-updated federal law ``creates an impermissible national
standard of obscenity.''
   They said past Supreme Court decisions on obscenity require that

community standards.
   The case is Carlin Communications vs. FCC, 88-37.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's girlfriend
and her architect husband have divorced by mutual consent, a court
official said today.
   The official, requesting anonymity in accordance with Greek
practice, said the divorce ``would become final within one week _
when the papers are processed.''
   Dimitra Liani, a 34-year-old Olympic Airways flight attendant,
married Alex Kapopoulos, 48, a former prominent member of the
Revolutionary Greek Communist Party, in a civil ceremony in 1982.
The couple have no children.
   They parted after working together on a 1986 television series
promoting equality of the sexes.
   Ms. Liani presented the program, which featured the premier as
the first guest. Kapopoulos was the producer and still works for
state-run channel ERT-1.
   Papandreou, 69, said before undergoing open-heart surgery in
London last month that he intends to divorce his American wife,
Margaret. He is expected to marry Ms. Liani, according to officials
in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
   Mrs. Papandreou, 66, who heads a left-wing Greek feminist
organization, said she will only comment on her husband's plans
when he has fully recovered.
   Papandreou married Margaret Chant in a civil ceremony in the
United States in 1951. They have four grown children and two
grandchildren.
   Ms. Liani was in London with the premier during his two months
in the hospital and has made several public appearances with him
since they returned to Greece last weekend.

   Indian navy warships will resume sailing
in the Persian Gulf after a five-year hiatus caused by the
Iran-Iraq war, gulf-based diplomatic sources said today.
   They confirmed a report in the Dubai-based Gulf News that the
INS Ranvir and INS Shakti will be the first Indian ships to enter
the gulf in five years.
   The diplomats said the warships will call at Bahrain on Nov. 2.
The warships will also go to Oman, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations.
   Indian ships suspended voyages through the waterway during the
so-called tanker war, when Iran attacked neutral shipping in
revenge for Iraqi attacks ships ferrying Iranian oil.
   Other countries deployed warships in the waterway to protect
their merchant vessels from attack.
   India has maintained good relations with both Iran and Iraq. A
cease-fire halted the 8-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug.20.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to overturn a
$75,000 libel award to a Virgin Islands bar and restaurant that had
the same name as a bar featured in an adult magazine's erotic
fiction.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by High Society
magazine's publishers, who said they were unaware the restaurant in
the article entitled ``Savage Lust'' bore any resemblance to a real
business establishment.
   High Society was sued by S & H Management Corp. and its
president, Jaber Samad, owner of a restaurant called the Carousel
on St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.
   High Society is published by Drake Publishers Inc.
   ``Savage Lust,'' which appeared in the December 1981 issue of
the magazine, was a fictional account of a St. Thomas bar also
called the Carousel. The article described the bar as a ``sailor's
dive'' frequented by prostitutes and ``a symbol of tropical
decadence and moral decay.''
   The story described how a female customer was drugged, kidnapped
and sexually assaulted by the owner.
   U.S. District Judge Almeric L. Christian ruled that the article
hurt the real Carousel's reputation and ``would deter a desirable
clientele from patronizing the bar.''
   Gloria Leonard, publisher of High Society, testified she was
unaware there was a real bar on St. Thomas called the Carousel.
   But Christian concluded she knew of the bar's existence since
she had been a frequent visitor to St. Thomas and could recall the
names of businesses located on either side of the Carousel.
   The judge said Samad had proven that the article referred to his
bar.
   ``The fact that fiction purports not to concern real persons or
events is of no consequence in determining the merits of a
defamation action,'' Christian said.
   The judge added that the magazine was guilty of ``actual
malice'' by acting ``with reckless disregard as to the truth or
falsity'' of the events described in the article.
   But Christian said the magazine still could be forced to pay the
libel award even if it was guilty only of negligence.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last April upheld the
libel award in a one-page order.
   Drake Publishers said the appeals court thus failed to examine
the case carefully as required by a 1984 Supreme Court libel ruling.
   The appeals court ``has wrapped its decision-making and review
process in a cloak of silence,'' the company said. ``Drake's right
under the First Amendment to an independent appellate examination
of the whole record cannot be so lightly or easily sidestepped.''
   The case is Drake Publishers vs. Samad, 88-369.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, declining to further expand
its study of drug testing in the workplace, today rejected an
appeal by Justice Department employees who say such tests would
violate their rights.
   The court, without comment, refused to intercede in the case _
which has yet to be argued before a lower court.
   The random drug-testing program for the Justice Department stems
from an executive order by President Reagan in 1986 that authorizes
heads of federal agencies to conduct tests for those in ``sensitive
positions.''
   The ``drug-free workplace plan'' adopted by former Attorney
General Edwin Meese applies to numerous department employees,
including anyone with access to top secret information, high-level
appointees and attorneys and their assistants who conduct grand
jury investigations.
   The program was challenged by 38 attorneys, three paralegals and
one economist.
   They said requiring them to submit to random urine tests _ when
there is no reason to suspect them of drug use _ violates their
constitutional privacy rights.
   A federal judge blocked the tests pending further court action.
The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here scheduled arguments in the
case for Dec. 15.
   But the department employees, saying they faced ``an
unprecedented frontal assault on personal privacy and bodily
integrity,'' appealed directly to the Supreme Court to decide the
case without waiting for a lower court opinion.
   ``Hundreds of thousands of federal employees should not be left
at risk of losing either their livelihood or their constitutional
rights while awaiting resolution'' of the case, they said.
   They said those who ``refuse to urinate under surveillance and
submit their urine to the government's fishing expedition for
evidence of drug use'' would be fired unlawfully.
   Solicitor General Charles Fried, the Reagan administration's top
courtroom lawyer who would be subject himself to the drug tests,
asked the high court to reject the appeal.
   ``The regular judicial process should be allowed to run its
course'' and the Supreme Court should keep hands off until the
appeals court here reviews the case, he said.
   The justices previously agreed to examine drug tests in three
cases to be decided by next July.
   They will determine whether a railroad company may routinely
test its workers; whether the federal government may require the
tests for railroad workers who have been involved in serious train
accidents; and whether the U.S. Customs Service may test those
seeking jobs related to drug enforcement.
   The Justice Department employees said the tests planned for that
agency are similar to those planned for hundreds of thousands of
federal workers. The Reagan administration has said that 345,000
federal employees are designated for random tests under Reagan's
1986 order.
   The case is Harmon vs. Thornburgh, 88-427.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling in Nebraska Trademark Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to allow the
sale of T-shirts and other items parodying nuclear war with a
design resembling an insurance company's trademark.
   The court, let stand a ruling that the design illegally
infringes on the trademark of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case. But
the votes of at least four justices are required to grant such
review.
   Mutual of Omaha sued Franklyn Novak, who was living in Omaha,
Neb., when in 1983 he got the idea for the design.
   He said he used Mutual of Omaha's logo as inspiration for his
design showing the emaciated profile of a face wearing an Indian
bonnet of burned or charred feathers with ``X'' in place of an eye.
   Alongside the Indian head was the inscription: Mutant of Omaha,
Nuclear Holocaust Insurance.
   The Mutual of Omaha insignia is an Indian head with the
company's name alongside.
   Novak sold about 4,000 T-shirts bearing his logo design on the
front and on the back the message, ``When the world's in ashes
we'll have you covered.''
   Novak also placed the design on sweatshirts, caps, buttons and
coffee mugs.
   A federal judge ruled that Novak's use of the design could
confuse people into believing that Mutual of Omaha was affiliated
with the merchandise. The judge barred him from advertising or
marketing the items.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 1987 upheld
the injunction.
   The appeals court rejected Novak's argument that his design is a
legitimate exercise of free-speech rights.
   ``The protection afforded by the First Amendment does not give
Novak license to infringe the rights of Mutual,'' the appeals court
said. ``Given the circumstances of this case, Mutual's property
rights should not yield.''
   The appeals court said the injunction is not a blanket ban on
Novak's right of free expression. It doesn't restrain him from
engaging in ``editorial parody in a book, magazine or film,'' the
appeals court said.
   The case is Novak vs. Mutual of Omaha, 87-1908.

<HEAD>Justices Reject Appeal to Kansas Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
Kansas prosecutors challenging state laws that broadly justify
using deadly force to defend someone's home or personal property.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Kansas laws that permit
use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or
great bodily harm.
   The controversy arose when Lloyd D. Clothier was charged with
involuntary manslaughter for fatally shooting a 15-year-old boy at
his Wichita home Nov. 23, 1986.
   Trial testimony established that Clothier was awakened in the
pre-dawn hours that day by his dog's barking and growling.
   Taking a loaded revolver from his nightstand, Clothier looked
out a window and saw someone in his driveway reaching into
Clothier's van. Clothier said he was worried that the intruder
would find his garage door opener in the van, and use it to gain
access into his home.
   Clothier testified that he fired a warning shot and saw someone
run behind the van and across the yard. He testified that he fired
another warning shot at the ground before stepping outside the
house.
   One of the bullets hit Seanan Picard in the head. The youth, who
was unarmed, died a short time later.
   Sedgwick County prosecutors charged Clothier with involuntary
manslaughter in the shooting. But a jury acquitted him after being
read what Kansas law says about the defense of a dwelling and
personal property.
   One law says a person ``is justified in the use of force ... he
reasonably believes ... is necessary to prevent or terminate such
other's unlawful entry into or attack upon his dwelling.''
   Another law says a person may defend against the theft of his
possessions with the ``degree of force or threat thereof as a
reasonable man would deem necessary to prevent or terminate the
interferenc.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Kansas prosecutors urged the
justices to ``change laws which give greater deference to property
than to human life by striking down the Kansas statutes which allow
this inequity.''
   The appeal noted that there is ``no definitive, universal
solution on the issue of using deadly force to defend one's home
and property.''
   The prosecutors said, for example, that Texas law justifies one
person's killing another to protect land or property. They said the
Texas law ``goes so far as to permit the use of deadly force to
prevent one from fleeing with property, even though the escapee is
no longer a threat to the defender.''
   Conversely, the appeal said, ``many states (have laws) holding
that the use of deadly force which results in the taking of human
life merely to defend any property is never reasonable.''
   The appeal argued, ``It is absurd that a person who guns down a
15-year-old boy for tampering with his vehicle may be held to
answer for his use of excessive force in one state but may shoot
with impunity in another.''
   The Kansas Supreme Court rejected the prosecutors' arguments
last April 29, saying their appeal ``presents essentially a quarrel
with the legislative wisdom of deciding to grant the defenses set
forth'' under the state laws.
   The case is Kansas vs. Clothier, 88-168.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Indiana Judge on Firing of Public
Defenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that a judge may not fire public defenders because of their
political affiliation.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an Indiana
judge ordered to pay $61,075 to two assistant public defenders who
sued the judge for violating their rights.
   The political patronage case stems from the appointment of James
J. Krajewski to be a Lake County Court judge in 1985. He was named
to replace Orval Anderson, who was indicted on federal perjury
charges.
   Nearly a year after he was appointed, Krajewski, a Republican,
fired assistant public defenders Stephen A. Kurowski and David H.
Nicholls, both Democrats.
   Krajewski said he dismissed the public defenders in a general
house-cleaning of the office. Kurowski and Nicholls had served
under the previous chief public defender, who had been convicted of
criminal misconduct along with Anderson.
   But Kurowski and Nicholls said the real reason they were fired
was because they were Democrats and Krajewski wanted to name
Republicans to replace them.
   A federal magistrate awarded damages to the public defenders,
and that ruling was upheld last June by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   The appeals court said the evidence was clear that the two men
were fired because of their political affiliation.
   The appeals court also rejected Krajewski's arguments that he
had the proper authority to dismiss the public defenders for
political reasons.
   Citing a 1980 Supreme Court ruling, the appeals court said a
judge may not fire assistant public defenders on political grounds.
   The 1980 high court ruling held that a chief public defender may
not fire his assistants because of their political affiliation.
   The 7th Circuit court said that ruling ``turned on the
characteristics of the assistant public defender's job, not on the
office of the person doing the firing.''
   The appeals court rejected Krajewski's claim that assistant
public defenders in Indiana hold ``policy-making'' jobs _ and
therefore can be fired for political affiliation _ because public
defenders are eligible to serve as temporary county court judges.
   The appeals court said that argument does not hold up because
any lawyer in the state _ not just a public defender _ can be
picked by a judge to fill in on the bench in the judge's absence.
   Judicial service is not part of the public defender's office,
the appeals court said. Public defenders ``represent criminal
defendants, and their loyalty as advocates runs to their clients,
not to their employer,'' the appeals court said.
   Krajewski was ordered to pay $59,075 in compensatory damages and
$2,000 in punitive damages to Kurowski and Nicholls, who also were
ordered reinstated in the public defender jobs. They also were
awarded $13,905 in reimbursement for their attorneys' fees.
   The case is Krajewski vs. Kurowski, 88-391.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Reagan
administration for advice on whether the justices should kill a
lawsuit growing out of the development of an aeromedical center in
Kaduna, Nigeria.
   The court asked the Justice Department to give its views on a
decision requiring W.S. Kirkpatrick & Co., a New Jersey
corporation, to defend itself against allegations that it won the
contract by illegally bribing Nigerian government officials.
   Those allegations are raised in a suit filed by Environmental
Tectonics Corp. of Pennsylvania.
   A Justice Department investigation of the 1981 contract between
Kirkpatrick and the Nigerian government led to Kirkpatrick's
pleading guilty to one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act.
   Kirkpatrick was fined $75,000.
   Environmental Tectonics, which had submitted a lower bid for the
Nigerian contract, then sued Kirkpatrick. Its lawsuit alleged that
Environmental Tectonics would have been awarded the contract but
for Kirkpatrick's payment of bribes.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit, relying on the so-called
``act of state doctrine.'' It precludes U.S. courts from inquiring
into the validity of a foreign government's acts committed within
its own territory.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reinstated the
suit last May 2. ``The traditional justification for invoking the
doctrine _ avoiding a judicial determination of the legal validity
of a state's act within its own borders _ is not present in this
case,'' the appeals court said.
   Kirkpatrick then sought the Supreme Court's help.
   The case is Kirkpatrick & Co. vs. Environmental Tectonics Corp.,
87-2066.

<TEXT>
   More than 6,000 taxis ringed downtown
Athens today and cabdrivers demonstrated outside the Transport
Ministry to protest anti-pollution measures that restrict their
access to the city.
   Half of Athens' 800,000 cars _ including 25,000 taxis _ are
banned from a five-square-mile zone around the city center between
7 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays. Under the ban, introduced in
January, vehicles with license plates ending in an even number
alternate with those bearing an odd-numbered last digit.
   The drivers fiercely object to the ban because they say 50
percent of their fares are generated in the restricted zone.
   Today's protest, which caused a traffic jam in the center,
followed a monthlong boycott of the restricted area by cabdrivers.
   ``It's ridiculous to say that we're solely to blame for Athens'
pollution ... if the government really wants to solve the problem
it should improve the quality of diesel gas and not restrict our
movements in the city center,'' said taxi driver Emmanuel Loukas,
35.
   Environmental control authorities say that exhaust fumes from
diesel-fueled taxis, aging buses and private cars are responsible
for the high levels of atmospheric pollution in the capital. But
taxi drivers claim they cause less than 7 percent of the pollution.
   ``That's not enough for the government to expect us to send our
cars to the junk yard and buy others that run on lead-free
petrol,'' said driver Panayiotis Liakos.
   Most Athens taxis run on diesel fuel, but more than 100 of them
have recently converted to unleaded gasoline in a bid to bypass the
ban. The government has said that all cabs running on unleaded
gasoline would be able to move freely in the restricted zone.
   But the drivers, who earn an average take-home salary of about
$400 a month, say they cannot afford to make the change.
   ``How can the government honestly expect us to go out and buy
new cars ... none of us have the capital to do that,'' said
cabdriver Konstantinos Stefanides.
   A gallon of unleaded gasoline costs about $2.40, compared to
about $1.00 for diesel fuel.
   ``If our cars were to run on (unleaded fuel), we would have to
raise our fares substantively,'' said Stefanides. ``It would be the
end of some of the cheapest taxis in the world.''
   A taxi ride from Athens International Airport to the city costs
$4.

<HEAD>Court Allows Alaska Officials to Enforce Law on Political
Contributions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed Alaska
officials to enforce a state law requiring groups of two or more
people to report political campaign contributions.
   The court, citing a lack of a substantial federal question,
rejected an appeal by an oil field service company fined $72,600
for not reporting paycheck withholding of $100 per worker and
payment of the money to legislative candidates.
   The company, VECO International Inc., collected $41,080 in
campaign contributions by mid-December 1983. The money generally
went to candidates picked by an oil and gas industry political
action committee.
   VECO encouraged its employees to allow $100 to be withheld for
donations. The workers could choose not to contribute or could
earmark the money for specific candidates.
   The company was told by a state official in August 1983 that it
would not have to register the withholding plan with the state or
report the contributions.
   But the Alaska Public Offices Commission that supervises the
campaign reporting law later wrote to VECO indicating the company
was not exempt from the act.
   The Alaska Supreme Court last April upheld the fine against
VECO. The state court said the contributions were provided by a
group _ and not separate individuals _ since the company ``has a
significant role in candidate selection.''
   The state court also rejected arguments that the law is too
broad because it imposes disclosure requirements on small groups
that spend minor sums of money supporting candidates.
   ``There is a level of joint political activity below which the
government has no legitimate interest in regulating,'' the state
court said.
   But the state court said VECO's plan was above that level and
there was no danger of chilling political activity by interpreting
the law to apply to the plan.
   ``VECO furnished substantial support to candidates in the 1984
election,'' the state court said. ``The public was not informed of
this support and to that extent the statutory purpose was
frustrated.''
   The case is VECO vs. Alaska Public Offices Commission, 88-177.

   Soviet claims against the United States for
construction delays on its Washington embassy exceed the $29
million the United States wants for its unfinished embassy in
Moscow, an official said today.
   ``We also have bills to present to the American side,'' Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news
conference.
   Claims for late delivery of equipment and construction materials
and other problems would top the sum U.S. officials are seeking
from the Soviet Union, he said.
   President Reagan said Thursday that he was recommending the main
office building of the new U.S. Embassy compound in Moscow be torn
down because it is riddled with Soviet bugging devices.
   The United States is not allowing the Soviet Union to occupy its
new building in Washington until the Americans are satisfied with
the status of their Moscow building.
   The U.S. claim is for damage and defective construction. No
figure has been established for a claim against the Soviet Union
for bugging the building, U.S. State Department spokesman Phyllis
Oakley said.
   Soviet officials deny the building is bugged and say the United
States has provided no proof.
   Gerasimov told reporters last week that the United States is
free to do what it wants with its embassy in Moscow, but that there
was ``a certain anti-Soviet aftertaste'' in Reagan's decision.
   The United States and Soviet Union have held direct talks on
their claims, and U.S. officials said last week they would ask
outside arbiters to settle the dispute.

   Cornhusker, located on a 160-acre ranch, provides 24-hour
residential care to children placed by parents, courts and the
state Department of Social Services.
   The children attend public schools in Culbertson, Neb., and live
in cottages in a family-type atmosphere with house parents.
   Up to 1983, Cornhusker had a written policy on discipline that
permitted a house parent to use corporal punishment _ ``such as the
spanking on the buttocks by the open hand or a suitable instrument
for the purpose of inflicting temporary pain.''
   But in 1983 state officials adopted a new policy, prohibiting
such corporal punishment.
   Cornhusker amended its disciplinary policy under protest, and
challenged the state's policy in court. At the time, 15 children
ranging in age from 8 to 16 lived at the home.
   A state trial judge found the state regulation invalid on state
law grounds.
   The Nebraska Supreme Court last December reversed the trial
judge's ruling and reinstated the state regulation barring corporal
punishment at homes such as Cornhusker.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Cornhusker argued that
the no-spanking state policy violates the rights of parents who
entrust their children to such homes.
   ``The regulation is a remarkable state intrusion on a clear and
oft-recognized parental liberty interest to control and direct the
welfare of a child,'' the appeal said.
   The case is Cornhusker Christian Children's Home vs. Nebraska
DDS, 87-2058.

<HEAD>Court Rules on Miranda Issue in Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that police in
Pennsylvania did not violate the rights of a man suspected of
drunken driving by failing to read the motorist his so-called
Miranda warnings soon enough.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with
Pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly
required police to warn motorists of their right against
self-incrimination.
   Relying on a 1984 ruling, the court said that ordinarily when
police stop a motorist they are not required to give the Miranda
warnings because the motorist is not in custody.
   The motorist ``was not entitled to a recitation of his
constitutional rights prior to arrest, and his roadside responses
to questioning were admissible'' as evidence, the court said.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   Thomas A. Bruder Jr. was stopped in Newtown Township, Pa., the
morning of Jan. 19, 1985, by a police officer who said Bruder was
driving erratically.
   The officer said Bruder was swerving back and forth across the
highway. He said that after stopping his car and emerging, Bruder
had difficulty maintaining his balance.
   The officer asked Bruder if he had been drinking and Bruder
replied in the affirmative. The policeman also asked Bruder to
recite the alphabet, a task the officer said Bruder performed
poorly.
   After that, Bruder was arrested and warned that he had a right
to a lawyer, to remain silent and that anything he said could be
held against him.
   A judge found him guilty of driving under the influence of
alcohol and sentenced him to a term of 48 hours to six months in
jail.
   A three-judge state court overturned the conviction last year,
ruling that Bruder was entitled to the Miranda warnings earlier.
   The state court said Bruder was entitled to the warnings before
being questioned by the police officer, even though he had not been
arrested formally.
   Bruder had good reason to believe he was not free to leave and,
in effect, was in police custody when stopped, the state court said.
   ``The test of custodial interrogation is whether the individual
being interrogated reasonably believes his freedom of action is
being restricted,'' the state court said. ``Undoubtedly, (Bruder)
was not free to leave when he made the statements elicited.''
   Also, the state court said, requiring Bruder to recite the
alphabet was akin to taking testimony from him, and should not
occur before he was read his rights.
   The state court contrasted the recitation with taking a purely
physical test for sobriety _ such as walking a straight line.
   ``We view the recitation of the alphabet as essentially
communicative in nature,'' the state court said. It said Bruder
could be retried, but his pre-Miranda statements and testimony
about reciting the alphabet must be excluded.
   Pennsylvania law enforcement officials said the state court
ruling violates a 1984 Supreme Court decision that permitted police
to question motorists without giving the Miranda warnings.
   The high court said in the 1984 case that the vast majority of
roadside detentions last only a few minutes and are conducted in
public. Generally, the court said then, the motorist feels he will
be permitted to go on his way and is not completely at the mercy of
the police.
   The Pennsylvania state court said the 1984 decision does not
rule out the possibility that in some cases police, even prior to
arrest, must warn motorists of their rights before questioning them.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Bruder, 88-161.

<HEAD>Court Allows California School Officials to Ban Bible Group
Material</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed public school
officials in California to ban leaflets and school yearbook
advertisements that promoted a student-run, lunch-hour Bible study
group.
   The court rejected an appeal by two students who said the
officials violated their free-speech rights.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case. But the votes of at
least four justices are required to grant such review.
   The students, Alexander Perumal and Frederick Read, were barred
by Saddleback Valley school district officials during the 1984-85
school year from distributing the religious club flyers or placing
ads in their high school yearbooks.
   Perumal attended El Toro High School and Read went to Mission
Viejo High School in the Saddleback Valley district.
   Officials allowed the students, members of a group called New
Life, to run Bible study and prayer groups during lunch hour
outside the school building.
   But the officials said permitting distribution of the handbills
and yearbook ads would violate constitutionally required separation
of church and state.
   The officials said permitting distribution of religious
literature and advertisements, in effect, would be giving
government backing to the Bible study group.
   The school district said it was acting in accord with a formal
policy that limits the use of school facilities to officially
approved student organizations and clubs.
   The officials noted that in 1981 the district withdrew
recognition of the New Life group after some parents complained.
   But Perumal and Read said the school district was practicing
unlawful censorship by restricting free expression about religion.
   A California appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling in January, said the
school officials acted properly.
   The appeals court said a school may decide to prohibit
``off-campus groups from functioning or advertising on campus.''
   The appeals court also said the Saddleback Valley policy
permitting only school-sponsored activities to function complies
with the Supreme Court's test for assuring separation of church and
state.
   That three-part test permits government-sponsored activities
that have a primary secular purpose, do not advance religion and do
not cause entanglement between government and religion.
   The case is Perumal vs. Saddleback Valley, 88-340.

   George Bush continues to hold slim leads over presidential rival
Michael Dukakis in the key battlegrounds of California, Texas,
Michigan and Washington, surveys indicate.
   An ABC News poll released today said Republican Bush was ahead
of Democrat Dukakis 51 percent to 44 percent in California. The
poll was conducted Saturday and Sunday of 510 likely voters, with a
margin of error of 5 points.
   New polls also showed Bush with a double-digit lead over the
Democratic nominee in New Jersey and with commanding advantages in
New Mexico, Utah, Kentucky, Indiana and Montana as he seeks the 270
Electoral College otes needed to win the election.
   The vice president led Dukakis by 21 points in a statewide poll
in Texas, which has the third largest electoral prize of 29 votes.
   A poll released Saturday by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and
WFAA-TV in Dallas had Bush leading Dukakis by 58-37 percent. The
poll of 1,443 likely voters, conducted Oct. 21-24, had a margin of
error of three percentage points.
   In Michigan, with its prize of 20 electoral votes, 47 percent of
the 400 registered voters surveyed favored the Republican ticket
while 41 percent prefer the Democratic slate, Detroit station
WJBK-TV reported Sunday.
   The survey, conducted Tuesday through Thursday, had a margin of
error of five percentage points.
   In Washington, Bush led Dukakis 50-45 percent in a poll of 642
voters surveyed Tuesday through Thursday. The poll, published in
Sunday's editions of the Morning News Tribune of Tacoma, had a
margin of error of four percentage points. Washington has 10
electoral votes.
   A statewide survey in New Jersey, which has 16 electoral votes,
found Bush's lead over Dukakis has grown to 14 points, 52-38
percent, among 800 likely voters polled Oct. 17-25. The survey,
published in Saturday's editions of The Star-Ledger of Newark, had
a margin of error of four percentage points.
   The vice president's lead in similar polls stood at three points
in mid-September and seven points at the end of the month.
   Bush holds his biggest lead in Utah where the Salt Lake Tribune
reported Sunday that 64 percent favored the Republican nominee
while 31 percent preferred Dukakis.
   The poll of 903 registered voters, conducted Monday through
Thursday, had a margin of error of about three percentage points.
Utah has five electoral votes.
   In Indiana, the home state of Bush's running mate, Sen. Dan
Quayle, the Republican ticket leads the Democrats 54 percent to 33
percent, according to a poll in Monday's editions of The
Indianapolis Star.
   The poll of 808 registered voters was conducted Tuesday through
Thursday and had a margin of error of four percentage points.
Indiana has 12 electoral votes.
   Bush held a 15-point lead over Dukakis, 53-38 percent, in
Kentucky. The poll of 674 likely voters, published Sunday in The
Louisville Courier-Journal, had a margin of error of four
percentage points.
   The survey was conducted Tuesday through Thursday in the state
with nine electoral votes at stake.
   In Montana, Bush led Dukakis 49-34 percent in a poll of 603
likely voters surveyed Oct. 15-24. The poll, published in Sunday's
Great Falls Tribune, had a margin of error of four percentage
points.
   The vice president also led in New Mexico, where 50 percent of
the 759 registered voters surveyed favored Bush to 38 percent for
Dukakis. The Albuquerque Journal poll, conducted Tuesday through
Thursday, had a margin of error of four percentage points.
   New Mexico has five electoral votes.

   Kitty Dukakis, wife of Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, canceled a campaign tour of
the Middle West today because of an upper respiratory viral
infection.
   Mrs. Dukakis underwent tests at the University of Minnesota
Hospital and Clinic in Minneapolis for two hours this morning and
will spend the rest of the day resting in her St. Paul hotel room,
said press secretary Paul Costello.
   He said a decision would be made early Tuesday on whether Mrs.
Dukakis will resume her travel schedule.
   The candidate's wife canceled plans for a breakfast this morning
with the wife of Gov. Rudy Perpich and an afternoon speech at South
St. Paul High School. Also canceled were appearances later in the
day at Bismarck, N.D., La Crosse, Wis., and Waterloo, Iowa.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon broke with the GOP for the first
time in its history by endorsing Democrat Michael Dukakis, joining
several newspapers nationwide that backed Dukakis and criticized
George Bush's negative campaign tactics.
   Dukakis also was endorsed by The New York Times, the Boston
Globe, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, the Philadelphia Inquirer,
the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer, the Greensboro (N.C.) News & Record
and New York Newsday, which called Bush's campaign ``sniveling,
dirty, distorted and irresponsible.''
   But the Globe said its endorsement came ``despite our uneasiness
with (Dukakis') leadership style and with the lack of focus in his
campaign.'' The newspaper said its temptation to endorse no one was
overcome when Bush ``displayed extraordinary weakness'' in choosing
Sen. Dan Quayle as his running mate.
   It also called the race ``one of the most trivial elections in
recent memory'' pitting ``two candidates as notable for their
weaknesses as their strengths.''
   Bush picked up endorsements Sunday from the Detroit News, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the Arizona Republic and the Denver
Post, which said that ``after wiping away the mud from both
candidates, The Post believes George Bush is the better choice.''
   The Eagle-Beacon, the largest newspaper in heavily Republican
Kansas, said in a Sunday editorial that the Democratic nominee
``seems uniquely prepared to deal with the crises certain to
confront the next president.''
   Dukakis ``has shown much deeper sensitivity toward the struggles
of millions of Americans to make ends meet,'' the newspaper said.
   Eagle-Beacon managing editor William R. Handy said it was the
paper's first endorsement of a Democrat for president since The
Wichita Eagle and The Wichita Beacon were formed in 1872 and the
two papers merged into a morning edition in 1980.
   This year, the editorial board said it was disgusted with
Republican nominee George Bush's negative campaign tactics.
   ``I think it reveals the broad distaste that the Bush campaign,
really both campaigns, has left in the mouth of the American
people,'' Neavoll said.
   ``Gov. Michael Dukakis has drawn criticism from his fellow
Democrats because he has refused _ or has been unable _ to match
the Republicans in meanspiritedness and contempt for the American
voters,'' the newspaper said.
   The editorial also said that while Bush has more than 20 years
in public service, ``he has left his fingerprints on so few
positive accomplishments.'' It also questioned Bush's choice of
Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, ``a feckless, shallow, politically
immature man,'' as his vice presidential running mate.
   The New York Times said the scales were tipped in Dukakis' favor
as the candidate likely to do a better job of ``getting America out
of hock'' from the Reagan administration's deficits, which it
called the most urgent task facing the next president.
   The vice president also was endorsed by the Sunday Oregonian of
Portland, that state's largest newspaper; the Miami Herald and five
smaller Florida newspapers, as well as the Topeka (Kan.)
Capital-Journal, the Maine Sunday Telegram of Portland and The
Blade of Toledo and the Akron Beacon Journal in Ohio.
   Dukakis won the endorsement of The Daytona Beach (Fla.)
News-Journal, the Tallahassee (Fla.) Democrat and Kentucky's two
largest papers, The Courier-Journal of Louisville and the Lexington
Herald-Leader, as well as the Roanoke (Va.) Times & World News.
   The St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch endorsed both
candidates, saying its editorial board was divided on which
candidate would make the better president.
   The Des Moines Register, the largest newspaper in Iowa, endorsed
Dukakis as best equipped to turn the nation's attention to
long-neglected domestic needs. The paper criticized Bush's ``smear
campaign'' and his ``alarming'' choice of Quayle as a running mate.
   The Cedar Rapids Gazette, the second largest paper in Iowa,
backed Bush for his promise of no new taxes and his support for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels and the Star Wars plan for a space-based
missile defense system.

<TEXT>
   The Lenin Shipyard, a hotbed of labor
activism where strikes eight years ago gave rise to the Solidarity
trade union movement, will be closed Dec. 1 because it is losing
money, the government said today.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, an electrician at the shipyard,
said workers were ready to take over the business and run it
profitably. The shipyard was closed today because of a holiday and
is to reopen Wednesday.
   Walesa called the decision a ``personal provocation of Prime
Minister Rakowski against the birthplace of Solidarity.''
   The shipyard is the first big industrial enterprise to be
singled out for closure by the government of Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who promised to aggressively restructure
Polish industry.
   Rakowski was a firm supporter of the Dec. 13, 1981, martial law
crackdown that crushed Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first free
trade union. He was named prime minister Sept. 27 to replace
Zbigniew Messner, who was criticized as ineffectual in reforming
the inefficient and debt-ridden economy.
   Rakowski said the move ``has nothing to do with Solidarity.'' In
a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., he said,
``If someone wants to make the Polish economy more healthy, he has
to start with very strong steps.''
   Walesa, in a statement released by an aide, said, ``Solidarity
will defend the enterprise which is _ for the union and for the
whole nation _ a symbol of the struggle for a new and better
Poland.''
   The government's move comes as it bickers with Solidarity over
proposed talks on social and economic reforms, including
legalization of Solidarity.
   After Walesa persuaded workers in August to end a wave of
nationwide strikes, authorities said they would sit down with the
opposition to discuss grievances. But officials object to
Solidarity's choice of negotiators.
   The official news agency PAP said Rakowski approved the decision
to close the shipyard Saturday. It referred to a speech he made
Oct. 13 when he presented his government to the Parliament:
   ``Rakowski announced that his government will go from words and
plans to firm acts which would recover the Polish economy.
   ``That would include liquidation of enterprises that are
inefficient, unproductive and some enterprises which require
subsidies from the state treasury,'' the agency said.
   The shipyard's workers will be offered jobs at other enterprises
in Gdansk province, PAP said. It said the 10,000 workers will have
some 30,000 jobs to choose from.
   PAP said the announcement of the closure ``is not a surprise for
public opinion or for the work force of the Lenin shipyard. The
possibility of liquidating this shipyard has been discussed in
public ... for a long time.''
   The shipyard, scene of strikes in May and August, has for two
decades been a center of union activity but has been in decline for
years.
   It was scheduled to build 11 ships this year, primarily for the
Soviet Union, which as an ally is afforded very favorable purchase
terms. In the late 1970s, it produced a high of 27 ships a year and
had more than 15,000 employees.
   One newspaper described it as a ``a giant on partly rotten
legs.''
   But the shipyard's director of foreign trade, Ireneusz Kubiczek,
said in July that the business was not necessarily unprofitable and
its main problem was a lack of work force to handle all the
potential contracts.
   In August 1980, a strike at the Lenin Shipyard gave rise to
Solidarity. Solidarity's membership grew to 10 million before it
was banned in 1982.
   Walesa said in a telephone interview that the union could cope
with the yard's problem if given the chance.
   ``We are ready to take over this enterprise and make it
profitable. We will help the (workers' council) take it over so
that the shipyard can work well and make its profits,'' he said.
   Walesa said he saw the announcement, which came during the
four-day All Saints' Day holiday when Poles remember their dead, as
an attempt by the government to provoke protests at the shipyards
and in other factories.
   There were no immediate announcements of protests, but the Rev.
Henryk Jankowski, pastor of St. Brygida's Church a few blocks from
the shipyard's gates, said he would celebrate Masses for the
shipyard workers every night this week, culminating with a Mass on
Sunday.
   Liquidating the shipyard's property will take at least one year,
PAP said. Production equipment not taken over by neighboring
shipyards will be converted to different uses, it said.
   The liquidation program assumes completing construction of those
ships already begun, PAP said. Remaining contracts outstanding will
be passed to other shipyards, it said.
   Rakowski's government has signaled on several occasions that it
would move briskly to shut down money-losing enterprises that drain
huge subsidies from the state.
   Industry Minister Mieczyslaw Wilczek said last week he has asked
his ministry staff to make a list of the country's 150 least
efficient enterprises for possible closure.

<NOTE>EDs: Inserts grafs 16-30, In other action, with other cases</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to consider
reviving an attempt by Congress to limit the president's authority
to withhold classified information from the nation's legislative
branch.
   The court said it will review a ruling that invalidated a law
aimed at giving Congress more access to national security
information.
   The justices are expected to announce their decision in 1989.
   A federal judge had ruled the law violates the required
separation of legislative and executive powers.
   The clash between Congress and the president over classified
information is a longstanding one.
   But the case acted on today has more recent origins in a
national security directive adopted by President Reagan in 983.
   The directive requires federal officials, before they are
allowed access to classified information, to sign an agreement that
they will not disclose the information.
   The directive also established a standard form for officials to
sign, promising they never will divulge classified or
``classifiable'' information without written permission from proper
authorities.
   Some members of Congress bridled at the directive, particularly
the use of the word ``classifiable.''
   They said the presidential order restricts the free-speech
rights of federal employees and ``allows after-the-fact
classification of information in order to punish whistleblowers for
making disclosures that embarrass their superiors.''
   Opponents of the presidential directive said the secrecy
agreement that federal employees were forced to sign would bar them
for life from revealing information to Congress which it is
entitled to receive.
   Congress then enacted legislation prohibiting use of funds
during the 1987-88 fiscal year to implement the standard forms
Reagan had authorized.
   The legislation, attached to a general government spending bill,
was aimed at blocking the executive branch from withholding
``classifiable'' information or from impeding congressional access
to such material.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch declared the legislation
unconstitutional last May.
   ``The statute impermissibly restricts the president's power to
fulfill obligations imposed upon him by his express constitutional
powers and the role of the executive in foreign relations,'' Gasch
said.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Agreed to decide whether states must continue to provide
lawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost their
initial round of appeals.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Virginia officials who
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead
to interminable delays in carrying out executions.
   _ Killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from the
World War II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in U.S. prison
camps.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that the
veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit
seeking compensation for property losses.
   _ Rejected an appeal by Kansas prosecutors challenging state
laws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend someone's
home or personal property.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Kansas laws that permit
use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or
great bodily harm.
   _ Let stand a ruling that a state may ban the possession of
child pornography.
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, rejected an appeal by
an Illinois couple who say state officials are intruding into the
privacy of the home to impose censorship.
   _ Declined to further expand its study of drug testing in the
workplace, rejecting an appeal by Justice Department employees who
say such tests would violate their rights.
   The court, without comment, refused to intercede in the case,
which has yet to be argued before a lower court.
   _ Ruled that police in Pennsylvania did not violate the rights
of a man suspected of drunken dirving by failing to read the
motorist his so-called Miranda warnings soon enough.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with
Pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly
required police to warn motorists of their right against
self-incrimination.
   _ Allowed public school officials in California to ban leaflets
and school yearbook advertisements that promoted a student-run,
lunch-hour Bible study group.
   The court rejected an appeal by two students who said the
officials violated their free-speech rights.
   In the classified-information case, the American Foreign Service
Association, representing members of the nation's diplomatic corps,
joined with senators and House members from both political parties
in appealing to the Supreme Court to reinstate the law.
   The Reagan administration defended Gasch's ruling.
   ``Surely the First Amendment does not confer an unfettered right
on an employee of the executive branch to disclose whatever
national security information he pleases outside authorized
channels, whether to a member of the public or to a member of
Congress,'' the Justice Department said.
   The law that Gasch threw out expired on Sept. 30 with the end of
the fiscal year. But a similar rider was attached to the spending
bill enacted for the current fiscal year.
   President Reagan announced Wednesday that he was pocket-vetoing
another measure intended to give new protection to federal
employees who expose government fraud and abuse.
   The president said the bill, which is not tied directly to the
case acted on by the court today, violates the Constitution. Since
Congress has adjourned, it cannot vote to override the veto.
   The case is American Foreign Service Association vs. Garfinkel,
87-2127.

<HEAD>Woman Dies After Getting Dead Daughter's Kidney In Transplant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman died two days after a transplant
operation in which she received the kidney of her daughter who had
died in a car accident, hospital officials said today.
   Hank Black, a spokesman for University Hospital, said Antoinette
Moore, 54, of Gadsden died Sunday evening. On Friday, doctors had
given her the kidney of her 26-year-old daughter, Terri Moore,
following the daughter's death from injuries suffered in a car
wreck earlier in the week.
   Mrs. Moore had suffered from kidney problems for seven years,
and had needed dialysis, a mechanical method of cleansing the
blood, for the last few months.
   Black said an autopsy was being performed today to determine the
cause of Mrs. Moore's death.
   He said Mrs. Moore did return to the operating room earlier
Sunday because of excessive bleeding. But there was no immediate
word from doctors on how the death might have been related to any
post-operative problems.
   Mrs. Moore's husband, Jay C. Moore, had said that he had mixed
emotions about the transplanting of his daughter's kidney into his
ailing wife.
   ``I just tell myself that I'm doing what my daughter would have
wanted,'' he said.
   The daughter was pronounced dead Thursday afternoon at a Gadsden
hospital following a roadway accident Tuesday. Black said the
daughter recently told her family that she wanted to become an
organ donor, so her family followed her wishes.
   Moore said his wife knew before the surgery that she was
receiving her daughter's kidney.
   Mrs. Moore had previously turned down her healthy 32-year-old
son's offer to donate one of his kidneys because of the threat to
his life that might occur if his other kidney failed.
   Black had said that Ms. Moore's other kidney was designated for
transplanting into a recipient in Florida.

   Academy award-winning actress Sally Field
and her family were soaked with jet fuel but escaped unhurt when
their private plane aborted takeoff and smashed into two parked
airplanes.
   ``It's absolutely a miracle'' no one was seriously injured in
Saturday's crash, said Pitkin County Airport operations manager
Bill Frome. ``We're very, very fortunate that it's our slow
period.''
   Field, 41, was en route to Burbank, Calif., when the Challenger
CL60 crashed. Also on board were her film producer husband, Alan
Greisman, 41, her 11-month-old son, Sam, and mother, Margaret
O'Mahoney, said Pitkin County sheriff's spokesman Steve Crockett.
   The pilot and co-pilot were treated for cuts and bruises,
Crockett said. A flight attendant on the jet was unhurt.
   ``I led them from the crash to the terminal building, and I
think she (Field) was in a state of semi-shock,'' said Frome. ``She
didn't know what had happened.
   ``The gas was just spurting out of the gas tanks,'' said Miss
Field's publicist, Pat Kingsley. ``They were covered with gas. They
had to get out of the plane and they got out on the wing and had to
jump about six feet to the ground.''
   Jeff Lumsden of the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office said the
plane lost power as it attempted takeoff, causing it to veer to the
right.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the
crash.
   The private jet had been loaned to Miss Field, who owns a home
overlooking Aspen, by producer and former talk-show host Merv
Griffin, the owner, according to Griffin's Los Angeles publicist,
Warren Cowan.
   The jet had flown into Aspen after taking Griffin and actress
Eva Gabor to Griffin's Monterey, Calif., ranch earlier Saturday,
Cowan said.
   The jets hit by Griffin's jet belong to entertainment
personality Burt Sugarman and Marty Raynes, the son-in-law of
oilman Marvin Davis, Cowan said.
   After the crash, Field and her family continued their journey
via a commercial flight out of Denver, Crockett said.
   Field won Oscars for her performances in the films ``Norma Rae''
and ``Places in the Heart.''

   Here are excerpts from the videotaped
messages received from American hostage Terry Anderson since his
abduction March 16, 1985:
   _Oct. 4, 1986, after the release from Soviet custody of American
journalist Nicholas Daniloff:
   After 2{ years of empty of empty talks and refusals to act on
the part of the Reagan administration, it hurt to see the
propaganda and bombast with which that administration solved the
problem of Mr. Daniloff, a citizen like us who was imprisoned only
a short time.
   How can any official justify the interest, attention and action
given in that case and the inattention given ours?
   We are surprised that the American government has put pressure
on other Arab and European governments not to negotiate in such
cases as ours, but surrendered itself on the Daniloff case,
releasing the Russian spy (Gennadiy) Zakharov who was working
against our people.
   _Dec. 24, 1987:
   To my government, I don't know what to say. To my family, I love
you and miss you very much. ... I am in good health but tired and
very lonely.
   Mr. President, I say again this cannot continue. There is a
limit for how long we can last and some of us are approaching their
limit. ... Surely by now you know what must be done and how you can
do it. This is difficult, but you can do it. There have been enough
careful consideration, cold discussion and enough secret
maneuvering.''
   I know that you're trying to get us out though I don't know
exactly what it is you've been doing. I only know that it hasn't
been enough or the right thing.
   _Oct. 31, 1988, following his 41st birthday:
   I'm well and being well treated. I received your birthday
greetings and as always that helped me very much.
   But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as the end of
my fourth year (in captivity) approaches, I find it difficult to
keep my hopes and my courage high.
   I've been very close to being released several times ... But
each time it seems that the U.S. government uses its influence to
stop any agreement ... I don't understand this.
   I gather there's been very little discussion about this problem
in the U.S. presidential campaign and that's disappointing, as is
President Reagan's complete failure to find a solution during his
eight years in office.
   I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious effort to
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks
to the Soviet Union for its help.... That kind of cooperation and
spirit is absolutely necessary to bring this situation to an end.
   Once again, this has gone on too long. It can't continue like
this.

   Two Swedish tourists who had been stabbed
and shot to death were found at the bottom of a cliff on an Inca
trail in the Andes, the Swedish Consulate said today.
   Bertha Arduz, the Swedish consul in La Paz, identified the
victims as Helene Larsdotter-Liedegren, 23, and Barbro Schwang, 20.
   She said the bodies of the two women were found by a farmer
Saturday. Police believe the two were killed a week ago.
   The trail the women were on crosses the Andes from an area east
of La Paz to the Yungas region. Because of the rugged terrain,
police said they were having problems retrieving the bodies.
   Police found a sleeping bag with a diary and documents belonging
to the two Swedes near the cliff where the bodies were found.
   Arduz said the Swedes were experienced travelers who planned on
crossing the Amazon River basin after leaving Bolivia.

<HEAD>Doomed Plane's Pilot Says He Hesitated Too Long</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of Delta Flight 1141 told
investigators he wishes he had applied full power immediately after
the first sign of trouble and not 23 seconds later as his Boeing
727 was about to crash, documents revealed today.
   The crash Aug. 31 at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
claimed 14 lives. There were 108 people aboard the jet, bound for
Salt Lake City.
   A transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape, among the eight
sets of documents released by the National Transportation Safety
Board, showed a routine takeoff down the runway with the plane
gaining proper speed and climbing power.
   Seconds after liftoff, however, there was the sound of a
``snap'' and then the jet's control column began to shake, an
advance warning that the aircraft was about to stall.
   ``Something's wrong,'' Capt. Larry Davis, who was at the
controls, was believed to have said. His exact words were not clear.
   Then followed the sounds of what is believed to be five
compressor stalls in the engines and the co-pilot announcing an
``engine failure.'' Investigators have said they have found no
evidence of a mechanical malfunction in any of the three engines.
   ``We're not gonna to make it,'' Davis said nearly 15 seconds
after the first ``snap'' was heard.
   But it was eight seconds more before he called for ``full
power,'' according to the transcript. Less than a second later came
the sound of the first impact.
   Davis said in interviews with NTSB investigators that ``in
retrospect I should have pushed up full power immediately,''
according to a separate document made public today by the NTSB.
   During the interview, Davis also said that he was aware his
aircraft had an unusually high nose-up position as it struggled to
gain lift, but that he was afraid to lower the nose, the normal
maneuver in an attempt to fly out of a stall, because he thought
impact with the ground was imminent.
   Davis said that in the seconds after liftoff the Boeing 727
began to ``roll violently.'' He told investigators, ``It was all I
could do to control the airplane.''
   He said at one point he thought ``we were going to make it, but
then we got more bangs.''
   Investigators have closely examined the three engines of the
jetliner and concluded that there was no mechanical failure. The
bangs have been widely interpreted as the compressor stalls caused
by an interruption of air flow, possibly because of an unusual
angle of the aircraft.
   The NTSB previously has said that there is evidence the plane's
flaps might not have been extended properly for takeoff, which
would have inhibited the plane's ability to gain lift. The flaps
were found in a retracted position in the wreckage, as was the
cockpit lever controlling the flaps.
   But the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder tape released
today indicates, as has been disclosed previously, that the flight
crew followed a pre-takeoff checklist that included specific
reference to the flap setting.
   ``Flaps,'' the flight engineer, Steven Judd, was heard to say.
   ``Fifteen, fifteen, green light,'' responded the co-pilot, Carey
Kirkland.
   The numbers were a reference to the degree of extension for the
flaps on the left and right wings. ``Green light'' referred to an
indicator light denoting the position of the wing slats, which also
must be extended in a takeoff.

   The Associated Press, in attributing a quote to Louise Harris of
Providence, R.I., on Oct. 17, implied that she believed the author
of the Pledge of Allegiance was a socialist.
   The original version of the pledge in The Youth's Companion
magazine in 1892 was unsigned. Once it caught on, competing claims
to authorship quickly emerged.
   Harris, who has written extensively on the origins of the
pledge, and other scholars say the author was James B. Upham, an
editor of The Youth's Companion.
   Two formal investigations _ by the U.S. Flag Association in 1939
and the Library of Congress in 1957 _ concluded that the Rev.
Francis Bellamy, who also was on the magazine's staff, was
responsible. Bellamy was a socialist.

<TEXT>
   An infuriated Lech Walesa vowed Monday to
fight government plans to close down the Lenin shipyard, the site
where the Solidarity trade union was born.
   The state-owned shipyard in Gdansk is being closed down Dec. 1.
It is the first big industrial plant to be singled out for closure
by the month-old government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F.
Rakowski.
   The decision was announced while the shipyard was closed on the
eve of All Saints' Day and caught many workers and Solidarity
activists by surprise. The yard reopens Wednesday.
   A longtime foe of Solidarity, Rakowski took office Sept. 27 with
a pledge to restructure Poland's aging industrial base and get the
economy moving. In an interview with the BBC, he said the decision
``has nothing to do with Solidarity.''
   The announcement came during an impasse in preparations for
talks between representatives of Solidarity and the government,
which had been promised to Walesa on Aug. 31 during the last strike
at the shipyard.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Walesa denounced the
decision as Rakowski's ``personal provocation ... against the
birthplace of Solidarity.'' Rakowski was a firm supporter of the
Dec. 13, 1981, martial-law crackdown on Solidarity.
   Walesa, himself a worker at the shipyard, said in a later
statement that ``Solidarity will defend the enterprise which is for
the union and for the whole nation a symbol of the struggle for a
new and better Poland.''
   The state-run news agency PAP said Rakowski on Saturday approved
an Industry Minstry recommendation to close the yard. It referred
to the premier's Oct. 13 speech when he presented his plan to
parliament.
   Rakowski told the BBC that ``there is no other way. If someone
wants to make the Polish economy more healthy, he has to start with
very strong steps.''
   ``Rakowski announced that his government will go from words and
plans to firm acts which would recover the Polish economy,'' PAP
said. ``That would include liquidation of enterprises that are
inefficient, unproductive and some enterprises which require
subsidies from the state treasury.''
   PAP added the decision should come as no surprise because the
possibility has been discussed publicly ``for a long time.''
   Rakowski replaced Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner, who was
criticized as ineffectual in reforming Poland's inefficient and
debt-ridden economy.
   Since taking over, he has announced cuts in several government
departments and allowed several independent groups to be legalized.
But closing the Lenin yard is his first move to streamline Poland's
heavy industry.
   The century-old shipyard, the scene of strikes in May and
August, employs about 10,000 workers and was scheduled to build 11
ships this year. It constructs ships primarily for the Soviet Union
for non-convertible currency.
   Articles in the press have questioned its financial efficacy,
with one newspaper describing the Lenin Shipyard ``as a giant on
partly rotten legs.''
   A strike at the shipyard in August 1980 gave rise to Solidarity,
the East bloc's first independent trade union whose membership grew
to 10 million before the union was banned in October 1982.
   But the yard has been in decline for more than a decade. In the
late 1970s, it produced a high of 27 ships one year. At that time,
its employment was more than 15,000.
   In July, the yard's director of foreign trade, Ireneusz
Kubiczek, said the yard was not necessarily unprofitable and said
its chief problem was a lack of workforce to handle all its
potential contracts.
   He said whether it was profitable or not was debatable, since it
all depended on the costs arbitrarily set by the state for
materials, taxes and credit. But management admitted it needed new
loans or subsidies in order to continue production.
   Walesa said his union could cope with the yard's financial
problem if given the chance.
   ``We are ready to take over this enterprise and make it
profitable. We will help the (workers' council) take it over so
that the shipyard can work well and make its profits,'' he said.
   He said he saw the announcement as an attempt by the government
to provoke protests at the shipyards and in other factories.
   The Rev. Henryk Jankowski, pastor of St. Brygida's Church near
the shipyard's gates, said he would celebrate Masses for shipyard
workers every night this week, culminating with a big Mass on
Sunday. But there were no immediate plans for protest actions.
   ``We will have to work out a general stand for the union,'' said
Bogdan Lis, Solidarity regional leader in Gdansk. ``I think that it
could lead to a new strike.''
   Walesa last week refused to meet with Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak about a government demand he drop two proposed
Solidarity delegates to the talks whom the government considers too
extreme.
   On Friday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain
plans to visit the towering Solidarity monument just outside the
shipyard gates.
   The PAP communique said the shipyard's workers would be offered
jobs at other enterprises in Gdansk province. It said the 10,000
workers will have 30,000 jobs to choose from.
   Liquidating the shipyard's property will take at least a year,
the communique said.
   Rakowski's government has signaled on several occasions it would
move briskly to shut down money-losing enterprises that are a drain
on the state.
   ``Perhaps fewer and fewer shipyards would make for more
efficient shipyards,'' newly appointed Industry Minister Mieczyslaw
Wilczek told a news conference last week. Wilczek said he has asked
for a list of the country's 150 least-efficient enterprises for
possible closure.

<TEXT>
   Republican nominee George Bush today
mocked Michael Dukakis' sudden embrace of the liberal label as a
``breakthrough'' and dismissed his Democratic rival's invitation to
an election-eve debate next Monday night.
   The vice president said the real debate should feature Dukakis
and Dukakis, ``the new left vs. the old left.''
   A combative Bush attacked Dukakis for his declaration that
``Yes, I'm a liberal'' during a campaign swing Sunday through
California, and a new poll showed the vice president with a
15-point lead over the Massachusetts governor.
   The survey, taken last week by The Courier-Journal in
Louisville, said Bush had a 53 percent to 38 percent advantage in
Kentucky, a dramatic gain from his two-point lead around Labor Day.
   Nine electoral votes are at stake in Kentucky, where the
Bush-Dukakis battle originally was predicted to be close.
   After weeks of trying to avoid the liberal label that Bush
repeatedly sought to paste on him, Dukakis suddenly wore it proudly
Sunday. ``I'm a liberal in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and
Harry Truman and John Kennedy,'' he said.
   Bush wasted no time in responding today at his first rally of a
campaign day that also will take him to St. Louis and Kansas City,
Mo.
   ``Now for the breakthrough,'' the GOP nominee said.
   Bush recalled that during their last nationally broadcast debate
in Los Angeles on Oct. 13, Dukakis ``jumped all over me for using
the L word. Well, speaking of my opponent, yesterday, miracle of
miracles, headlines, read all about it, he's using the liberal
label again.''
   Dukakis had challenged Bush to a one-hour debate the night
before the Nov. 8 balloting to talk about ``what it takes to lead
this country and unite this country.''
   Bush chimed in with a counter-proposal. ``There should be a
debate, Dukakis vs. Dukakis, an entertaining debate, the new left
vs. the old left.''
   He added: ``The governor of Massachusetts could suddenly pretend
to be in the tradition that is prepared to use force to defend
freedom, but then the other governor of Massachusetts could explain
why he failed to support that needed military action in Grenada or
the action against that terrorist, Moammar Gadhafi, and why he has
opposed every weapon system to modernize our defense. What a
debate.''
   ``One could claim to be on the side of ordinary Americans and
the other Dukakis could explain why he thinks ordinary Americans
oppose the death penalty for drug kingpins like he does, favor
these weekend furloughs for first-degree murderers who have not
served enough time to be eligible for parole,' and oppose a law
that would require teachers to lead their classes in reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance, Bush said
   ``Dukakis vs. Dukakis,'' he said. ``What a debate. It should be
very, very interesting.''
   As the crowd applauded, Bush concluded, ``Will the real liberal
please stand up? God knows what would happen.''
   Campaigning in Philadelphia on Sunday, Bush told reporters he
didn't believe recent polls indicating that his lead over Dukakis
is narrowing.
   The Dukakis camp said Bush's lead had shrunk to six percentage
points, but GOP aides said it had settled in the double-digit range
after some fluctuations.
   A new Time magazine poll of 1,096 probable voters showed Bush
leading by 10 percentage points, 50 percent to 40 percent. The
survey was conducted Tuesday and Wednesday and results had a margin
of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   His schedule later in the week tentatively calls for him to hit
Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and California.
   Bush, speaking to supporters outside the campaign's headquarters
in suburban Montgomery County, Pa., encouraged voters to go to the
polls on Election Day.
   ``From now on it's get out that vote. As for Barbara and me,
we're going to keep running like we're 10 points behind. Nobody is
going to out-work us,'' he told the gathering.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said campaign officials had
always expected to see the poll numbers tighten and were not
alarmed by the latest apparent shift toward Dukakis.
   ``I think it's to be expected as you get to the final days of
the campaign that you're going to see some tightening in this race,
but that's going to cause us to work harder. We'll not allow
ourselves to lose the edge we've had as a campaign team,'' Fuller
said.
   Meanwhile, Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III repudiated
a Republican campaign flier circulating in Maryland with
side-by-side photographs of Dukakis and Willie Horton Jr., a
convicted murderer who raped a Maryland woman and slashed her
fiance after he escaped while on a Massachusetts prison furlough.
   Dukakis held Bush personally responsible for the fund-raising
letter which asks, ``Is this your pro-family team for 1988?''
   Baker, appearing on the CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' said the
flier was ``totally out of bounds and totally unauthorized.''
   But he said the Bush campaign could do nothing about it.
   ``You cannot control every party organization throughout the
country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Anti-Dissent Laws Under Revision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One law used to imprison Soviet political
dissidents will be rescinded and another likely will be revised to
cover specific acts against the state, the official Soviet news
agency Tass said today.
   It was the second promise within a week of impending
improvements for Soviet dissidents. West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said last week after talks in Moscow with officials including
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he had been told all
people regarded in the West as political prisoners will be freed by
the end of the year.
   On Monday, Justice Minister Boris Kravtsov told Tass that
Article 190, the law banning ``anti-Soviet slander,'' apparently
will be dropped in the current review of the Soviet criminal code.
   Article 70, barring ``anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda,''
probably will be restricted to cover concrete actions, Kravtsov
said.
   He also said the law on exit visas is being revised in
accordance with an international agreement on civil and political
rights.
   Kravtsov said only eight people are serving sentences under the
two anti-dissent laws.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, says it has information on 150 Soviets ``imprisoned
soley for their non-violent exercise of their fundamental human
rights.'' It counted 10,000 a few years ago.
   Soviet human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Andrei D. Sakharov said last week that there were 25 people still
in labor camps under Article 70.

<HEAD>Clergyman To Teach Course In Religious Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students enrolling in a new course at the
Whitaker School of Theology may find their names on a police rap
sheet.
   The seven-month introductory course on religious protest will
include demonstrations outside Detroit-area military contractors
such as General Dynamics Corp. in Warren and Williams International
Corp. in Walled Lake, said the instructor, the Rev. William
Wylie-Kellerman.
   Candidates for the priesthood in the Episcopal Diocese of
Michigan, which sponsors the school, will earn seminary credit for
the course, which begins Saturday.
   ``It is important to understand that worship and liturgy are
always political,'' said Wylie-Kellerman, 39, a United Methodist
who has been jailed nearly 40 times during protests at military and
weapons facilities in several states.
   Wylie-Kellerman said the protests to be staged as part of his
course will be ``a low-risk taste of this kind of direct action.''
Students will be asked to pray and read Bible passages and not
necessarily be arrested, he said.
   He said the course was meant to clarify the relationships among
politics, religion and militarism.
   ``There is a spiritual conflict over the culture of
militarism,'' he said. ``On one side there's a story of imperial
America, its manifest destiny and Rambo and `Make my day.' There's
a whole language and story about imperial America that Ronald
Reagan is living out.''
   He said the other side is the Bible and its story ``of
non-violent, forgiving love.''
   Judith Craig, bishop of Michigan's United Methodist Church,
supports Wylie-Kellerman.
   ``The thing I admire about Bill is that he never asks for an
exception from the rules,'' she said. ``He always accepts the
consequences of his actions.''

<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eugene Patterson retired Monday as
chief executive officer of the Times Publishing Co. of St.
Petersburg and was succeeded by Andrew Barnes, editor and president.
   Patterson, who turned 65 on Oct. 15, designated Barnes as his
successor at the 104-year-old St. Petersburg Times in 1984.
   Barnes, 49, said the change of leadership would mean little
dramatic change in the Times' operations.
   ``I don't expect to bring any major changes,'' he said. ``Over
time, will we respond to the world as it changes? Of course we
will. Will we look up in 10 years and will the Times be different?
Sure it will be different.''
   During Patterson's 10 years as CEO, daily circulation rose from
195,000 to more than 300,000, Sunday circulation grew from 243,000
to nearly 400,000 and annual revenue increased from $54 million to
$160 million.
   After World War II, Patterson became United Press bureau chief
in London. In 1956, he went to the Atlanta Constitution, and won a
Pulitzer Prize for his 1960s editorials opposing racism. He later
became managing editor of The Washington Post.
   Patterson brought Barnes to the Times from The Washington Post,
where he had been an assistant city editor.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
   
   The Court agreed to consider reviving an attempt by Congress to
limit the president's authority to withhold classified information
from the nation's legislative branch.
   The court said it will review a ruling that invalidated a law
aimed at giving Congress more access to national security
information.
   The case is American Foreign Service Association vs. Garfinkel,
87-2127.
   
   DEATH ROW
   
   The court agreed to decide whether states must continue to
provide lawyers for indigent death row inmates after they have lost
their initial round of appeals.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Virginia officials who
said requiring states to pay for attorneys in such cases could lead
to interminable delays in carrying out executions.
   The case is Murray vs. Giarrantano, 88-411.
   
   JAPANESE INTERNMENT
   
   The court killed a lawsuit against the government stemming from
the World War II mass detention of Japanese-Americans in U.S.
prison camps.
   The court, without comment, left intact rulings that the
veterans of the internment camps waited too long to file suit
seeking compensation for property losses.
   The case is Hohri vs. U.S., 88-215.
   
   DEADLY FORCE
   
   The court rejected an appeal by Kansas prosecutors challenging
state laws that broadly justify using deadly force to defend
someone's home or personal property.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Kansas laws that permit
use of deadly force even by people not threatened with death or
great bodily harm.
   The case is Kansas vs. Clothier, 88-168.
   
   CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
   
   The court let stand a ruling that a state may ban the possession
of child pornography.
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, rejected an appeal by
an Illinois couple who say state officials are intruding into the
privacy of the home to impose censorship.
   The case is Geever vs. Illinois, 88-381.
   
   DRUG TESTS
   
   The court declined to expand further its study of drug testing
in the workplace, rejecting an appeal by Justice Department
employees who say such tests would violate their rights.
   The court, without comment, refused to intercede in the case,
which has yet to be argued before a lower court.
   The case is Harmon vs. Thornburgh, 88-427.
   
   DRUNKEN DRIVING
   
   The court ruled that police in Pennsylvania did not violate the
rights of a man suspected of drunken driving by failing to read the
motorist his so-called Miranda warnings soon enough.
   The justices, by a 7-2 vote in an unsigned opinion, agreed with
Pennsylvania law enforcement officials that a lower court wrongly
required police to warn motorists of their right against
self-incrimination.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Bruder, 88-161.
   
   BIBLE CLUB
   
   The court allowed public school officials in California to ban
leaflets and school yearbook advertisements that promoted a
student-run, lunch-hour Bible study group.
   The court rejected an appeal by two students who said the
officials violated their free-speech rights.
   The case is Perumal vs. Saddleback Valley, 88-340.
   
   DIAL-A-PORN
   
   The court, for the second time in six months, refused to disturb
a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up message services
dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''
   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments that such bans
violate free-speech rights.
   The case is Carlin Communications vs. FCC, 88-37.
   
   PUBLIC DEFENDERS
   
   The court left intact a ruling that a judge may not fire public
defenders because of their political affiliation.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by an Indiana
judge ordered to pay $61,075 to two assistant public defenders who
sued the judge for violating their rights.
   The case is Krajewski vs. Kurowski, 88-391.
   
   SPANKING
   
   The court killed a challenge to a Nebraska policy prohibiting
facilities offering 24-hour care for children from using corporal
punishment.
   The justices, citing a lack of a substantial federal question,
let stand a Nebraska Supreme Court decision dismissing a challenge
to the law by the Cornhusker Christian Children's Home in Hitchcock
County, Neb.
   The case is Cornhusker Christian Children's Home vs. Nebraska
DDS, 87-2058.

   Pope John Paul II on Monday appointed a
chemistry professor, Giovanni Battista Marini-Bettolo Marconi, as
president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
   Marconi, 73, replaces Carlos Chagas, a 77-year-old Brazilian
biophysicist who served for 16 years as head of the academy, which
advises the pope on scientific issues.
   The new president took the name Marconi after his stepfather
Guglielmo Marconi, who invented wireless telegraphy in the late
1800s.
   The 385-year-old academy, based in a Renaissance villa in the
Vatican gardens, monitors scientific advances that might pose
moral, ethical or theological problems.
   In a speech to academy members at the end of their weeklong
conference, John Paul thanked the institute for its research on
agriculture.
   He noted that while food production today could serve all the
world's needs, ``the very unequal distribution of food resources
has not yet brought ... projects effective enough so that
agricultural production benefits all people and all men.''

<TEXT>
   H.D. Ross, a local retired judge, says
Democrat Wayne Dowdy has a winning combination in his uphill Senate
race against Republican Trent Lott: ``We got the old folks, the
rednecks and the blacks, and there ain't nothing in this state can
beat it.''
   That observation may contain a bit of bravado, for Dowdy trails
Lott by eight percentage points in the latest statewide poll. But
it also expresses a belief that politics in Mississippi haven't
changed as much as Lott would like to think.
   The schism in Mississippi politics along racial and economic
lines remains real. But Lott, the smooth, buttoned-down politician
who has risen to the No. 2 GOP leadership position in the House of
Representatives, believes the balance is changing.
   ``Wayne Dowdy is a good ol' boy, and Mississippi is getting away
from good ol' boys,'' Lott said last week in Clarksdale, the hub of
cotton-growing Delta country. ``People perceive him as a
backbencher. They see me as somebody who rose to a leadership
position.''
   In his three House terms, Dowdy took an active role in
supporting renewal of the Voting Rights Act, but otherwise has not
left a great legislative imprint.
   Mississippi's electorate is about one-third black and
substantially rural. The state, long the nation's poorest, has made
major economic strides in the past two decades. There are growing
numbers of young professionals who live mostly along the Gulf Coast
and in Jackson, the capital city, and they are overwhelmingly
Republican.
   The challenge for Dowdy, 45, is to get the maximum turnout by
blacks, who he believes will cast 90 percent or more of their votes
for him, and to grab about one of every three white voters.
   Dowdy concedes that will be difficult, but says he has a
reputation as a come-from-behind campaigner and that pollsters miss
many of his supporters who don't have telephones.
   On that night in Clarksdale, the joint appearance by the two
candidates battling for the seat of retiring Sen. John C. Stennis,
D-Miss., reflected their philosophical differences.
   Addressing a pro-Lott Chamber of Commerce crowd of 300 people,
Dowdy made a pitch for better roads and schools, two areas where he
said the federal government should play a greater role. Lott
countered that the answer to the state's problems is economic
development.
   ``The answer is the private sector,'' Lott said. He called for a
cut in the capital gains tax rate, which is one of Republican
presidential nominee George Bush's favorite campaign themes.
   Ironically, Lott received the heartiest applause of the evening
when he specifically urged widening U.S. 61, a worn, north-south
artery through the Delta, from two to four lanes.
   For Dowdy and his supporters, such moments are frustrating. They
say that Lott, 47, has built an eight-term congressional career on
pinching pennies _ including funds for his own state _ but is using
slick advertising to avoid paying the political price for those
past votes.
   Although he campaigns for road improvements, Lott has voted
against transportation appropriations bills in the House. A
television ad shows him canoeing through the wilderness, though an
environmental group has listed him among ``the dirty dozen'' in
Congress with the worst environmental voting records. Lott claims
to be among the staunchest defenders of Social Security, but does
not mention his 1981 vote to eliminate the minimum benefit.
   Lott's TV ads are produced by Robert Goodman, who made the
``Morning in America'' spots for President Reagan in 1984, and they
have been effective in softening the GOP candidate's cool partisan
edge.
   ``Sometimes I get that Teflon feeling,'' says Dowdy supporter
Walter Thompson, referring to Reagan's famed ability to shed
political negatives. ``We have not educated the people on what
Lott's votes really are.''
   Lott stumps from town to town before crowds turned out by a
well-oiled campaign machine. Dowdy's efforts seem more haphazard as
he makes unannounced visits to courthouses and local businesses.
   Lott seems to have generated enthusiasm in Jackson, where his
campaign posters have sprouted in the yards of white, middle-class
neighborhoods. The same signs are prominent along the main drags of
smaller towns, too.
   Dowdy, a country lawyer from McComb who became wealthy enough to
buy several radio stations, seems unconcerned. ``We don't get the
Main Street crowd,'' he says.
   Although he has outspent Dowdy by $2.6 million to $1.6 million,
Lott has never broken much above 50 percent in the polls, which
gives the Democratic candidate some comfort. Dowdy has gone on the
air with his own ads, one of which features an endorsement by the
widely revered Stennis.
   ``In the end, it's going to be decided among independent voters
as to likability,'' Dowdy said.
   One of Dowdy's big frustrations is having a Massachusetts
governor, Michael Dukakis, at the top of his party's national
ticket.
   It is hard to imagine two states more different culturally than
Massachusetts and Mississippi. When asked about Dukakis, Dowdy
prefers to talk instead about Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the vice
presidential candidate.
   ``We are not running from Dukakis, but his campaign is not doing
that well in our state,'' Dowdy observes. He predicts that Bush,
who is running more than 20 points ahead of Dukakis in Mississippi,
will help Lott by several percentage points.

<HEAD>Takeshita Still Faces Tests After Year in Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita quietly cast off
the shadow of a dynamic predecessor during his first year in
office, but now faces two major tests: a political scandal and the
approaching death of Emperor Hirohito.
   Takeshita is undynamic even by Japanese political standards. He
minimizes conflicts by seldom speaking out, and waits until a
consensus has formed before making political moves.
   His approach is a sharp contrast to the flamboyant
self-confidence of his predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone, who became
one of the few Japanese political leaders with a strong image
abroad.
   Takeshita's approach ``is a return to the traditional Japanese
political style,'' says Yozo Yokota, professor of international law
at International Christian University in Tokyo.
   ``Nakasone was outward-looking, but not so good at gathering
support within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,'' he said.
``Takeshita is the reverse. He spends time listening to various
views in the party and then seeks a consensus. He doesn't have his
own policies or philosophy.''
   During his first year as prime minister _ Thursday is the
anniversary _ Takeshita has weathered two political crises,
announced an expansion of Japan's diplomatic activities, dealt with
two major trade disputes and presided over a vigorous economic
recovery.
   Now, however, the 64-year-old leader faces a growing
stock-trading scandal involving top politicians and the inevitable
death of Hirohito, who has been gravely ill since September.
   The trading scandal involves shares in the Recruit-Cosmos real
estate company reportedly sold at low prices to dozens of prominent
politicians, business leaders and journalists before the stock was
publicly traded. When public trading began, the value of the shares
shot upward and the recipients made large profits.
   Takeshita, Nakasone, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and other
top officials acknowledged some aides bought Recuit-Cosmos shares,
but said they did not know about it.
   Government officials have said the transactions were legal but
opposition parties claim they were unethical and have demanded a
parliamentary investigation.
   If Japan's a parliament, the Diet, investigates the stock
scandal, one test of Takeshita's command will be whether he can
prevent it from spreading into other areas of political financing.
   ``There are a lot more disclosures to come,'' said Gregory
Clark, professor of Japanese studies at Sophia University in Tokyo.
   The approaching death of Hirohito, 87, is an emotional issue for
the nation.
   Japan has not experienced the death of an emperor under its
postwar constitution, which separates religion and the state.
Takeshita's government must decide how to handle the many
traditional Shinto-based funeral and related ceremonies.
   Some Japanese continue to link the imperial system with rightist
politics and militarism, and see the transition as a critical
period.
   Takeshita used adroit behind-the-scenes dealings and great skill
at manipulating the party bureaucracy to work his way up through
the ranks, and became leader of the largest faction of the
governing Liberal Democrats in 1987.
   While Nakasone often tried to circumvent government and party
structures by establishing special study commissions and advisory
groups, Takeshita has reaffirmed the role of bureaucrats, with whom
he feels comfortable.
   On U.S. demands for access to the Japanese public works
construction market, Takeshita gave complete negotiating authority
to Ichiro Ozawa, deputy chief Cabinet secretary. The dispute, which
dragged on for more than 1{ years and came to symbolize trade
differences between the two nations, was settled in March with
concessions from powerful Japanese industry groups.
   He also delegated negotiating power in talks on a U.S. demand
that Japan eliminate import restrictions on beef and oranges.
   Trade friction has declined during Takeshita's tenure because of
slower growth in exports attributable to the yen's higher value.
   In two crises during his first year in office, Takeshita took
little direct action, allowing both to run their course until the
people involved resigned.
   One concerned Seisuke Okuno, head of the National Land Agency,
who caused protests from abroad by saying that Japan was not the
aggressor in World War II. The other involved Koichi Hamada, head
of the powerful lower house Budget Committee, who called an
opposition politician a murderer.
   In foreign policy, Takeshita was widely expected to remain under
the influence of Nakasone, who took a special interest in the
field. Instead, he has traveled widely to build his own
international reputation, including trips to Southeast Asia, North
America, Europe, the Pacific, South Korea and China.
   In June, at the Toronto summit of Western leaders, Takeshita
pledged that Japan would expand its international political and
diplomatic role and increase foreign aid over five years to the
equivalent of $50 billion, which would make it the world's largest
donor.

   Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos
pleaded innocent to racketeering charges today, but a federal judge
refused to let her return to Hawaii until government and defense
lawyers iron out details of her $5 million bail.
   Mrs. Marcos brushed away a tear as U.S. District Judge John F.
Keenan said, ``I'm not going to let the lady go back to the
Hawaiian Islands until I'm certain the bail is set.'' He set
another hearing for Thursday.
   She and her entourage arrived Sunday by borrowed luxury jet from
Hawaii, where she and ousted Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
have lived in exile since fleeing their homeland in February 1986.
They are accused of embezzling $100 million from the Philippines.
   Defense lawyers had convinced Keenan that the 71-year-old Marcos
was too frail to make the trip to New York City for a court
appearance. His arraignment was postponed, at least until a
government physician examines him.
   The judge, however, ordered Mrs. Marcos, 59, to appear on the
charges that she and her husband used the country's money to buy
property including four New York buildings and artwork.
   As a small group of demonstrators changed anti-Marcos slogans,
Mrs. Marcos strode into court dressed in black high-heeled pumps
and an aqua-blue, off-the-shoulder full-length gown with puffy
sleeves.
   She spoke only twice during the 45-minute hearing, once to waive
a reading of the indictment, and once to answer ``Not guilty.''
   After the innocent plea was entered, the judge set bail to be
secured by real estate, cash and personal possessions ``amounting
to a reasonable market value of $5 million.''
   The judge first said he would not detain Mrs. Marcos, but a
hitch developed when prosecutors and defense lawyers could not
agree on what property and cash would be used to secure the bail.
   Defense lawyers, who originally wanted Mrs. Marcos released
without any bail, had agreed to a bail package in which the
Marcoses would put up $1.2 million in Philippine pesos along with
jewelry the couple brought to the United States when they fled
their homeland.
   ``I don't see how that can possibly be used as bail,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, noting that the jewelry is
subject to subpoena in an ongoing grand jury investigation and the
Philippine currency is subject to a claim by the current government
of that nation.
   The judge ordered the parties to return to court Thursday with
details on bail. Mrs. Marcos was then sent to be fingerprinted.
   The embezzlement and racketeering indictment was handed up Oct.
21. The main racketeering charge carries a maximum penalty of 20
years in prison upon conviction.
   Mrs. Marcos flew from Hawaii on Saturday, the first time she has
left the state since her exile there.
   On Sunday, a limousine brought her to the Waldorf Towers, one of
the New York locations where she threw lavish parties as first
lady. She was surrounded by reporters and photographers. Bodyguards
cleared a path as she and those with her strode inside the luxury
apartment-hotel without comment.
   A Marcos associate in Honolulu, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Mrs. Marcos hoped to shop and entertain old friends
while in New York.
   ``Her real concern is that she also hasn't left her husband's
side for three years and she's very concerned about his health,''
John Bartko, a Marcos attorney, said in Honolulu.
   ``She's going to meet her legal obligation, but I just don't see
her having a gay old time in New York City.''
   Sunday afternoon, Mrs. Marcos visited St. Patrick's Roman
Catholic Cathedral. Aides said the Waldorf bill, which reportedly
will run $1,800 a night, is to be paid by friends they won't
identify.
   The criminal indictment is similar to a 1986 civil lawsuit filed
in California by the Philippine government of Marcos' successor,
Corazon Aquino.
   ``We developed an idea, which the American courts bought, that a
dictator can't fleece his country, deposit the loot in the United
States and expect to get away with it,'' said Morton Stavis,
president of the Center for Constitutional Rights, a non-profit
legal group representing the Aquino government.
   In response to the lawsuit, an injunction was granted March 2,
1986, that prevented the sale or transfer of Marcos' New York
properties, which included four Manhattan commercial buildings and
a Long Island estate, with a total value reportedly in the hundreds
of millions of dollars.
   Mrs. Marcos arrived Sunday in a private Boeing 737 loaned by
American Tobacco Co. heiress Doris Duke. The plane, outfitted to
carry just 19, brought Mrs. Marcos' entourage, which included an
attorney, a nurse, secretary and several friends.
   The jet landed at Newark International Airport, where reporters
and about 40 supporters remained behind a gate out of sight from
Mrs. Marcos.
   ``We wanted to show Mrs. Marcos and President Marcos that there
are Filipinos who still support them,'' said Willy Paderon. ``I
hope they will be vindicated of all these politically motivated
charges that are coming left and right.
   ``They (the U.S. government) double-crossed the president. You
don't do that to friends. It's going to cost the U.S.''
   Six others were indicted with the Marcoses, including Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi, who is accused of acting as a front for
Marcos to help divert assets and hide his ownership of real estate
and art.

<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush knew the United
States secretly sold weapons to Iran in an effort to secure freedom
for American hostages, but he was unaware, he says, that profits
from the sales were later diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Bush, who was chief of a presidential task force on terrorism,
has tried to minimize his involvement in the Iran arms sale. He has
said ``mistakes were made,'' but claimed he was ``out of the loop''
in making major policy decisions.
   The congressional committees that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair said Bush was present at a White House meeting on Aug. 6,
1985, at which participants talked about allowing the Israelis to
sell U.S.-made missiles to Iran.
   President Reagan made no decision on the weapons sales,
participants said. But Secretary of State George Shultz and former
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger opposed the plan.
   Bush has steadfastly refused to reveal his recommendations, if
any, to the president.
   A few weeks later, the first shipment of TOW missiles was
delivered to Tehran.
   The Americans hoped the weapons sales would lead to freedom for
U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. Ultimately,
three hostages were released during the 14-month period before the
shipments were shopped in November 1986.
   Congressional committees and the Tower Commission made few
references to Bush, portraying him as a largely passive figure.
   Maine senators William Cohen, a Republican, and George Mitchell,
a Democrat, both members of the Iran-Contra committee, said in a
book they wrote that Bush's role remains an unanswered question.
They wrote that others in the Reagan administration were convinced
Bush had supported the plan.
   ``The vice president attended several meetings on the Iran
initiative, but none of the participants recall his views,'' the
report said.
   In February 1986, Bush's task force on terrorism released a
report recommending that no concessions be made to terrorists.
   In August 1986, Bush visited Jerusalem, where he received a
briefing on the arms-for-hostages deal from Amiram Nir, an Israeli
official who had worked with National Security Council officials on
the deal.
   Nir said the weapons sales were designed to ``get and hostages
out,'' as well as to ``build better contact with Iran. Nir told the
vice president: ``We are dealing with the most radical elements''
in Iran, according to the congressional report.
   But Bush did not comment except to thank Nir for pursuing the
initiative ``despite doubts and reservations throughout the
process.''
   The congressional committees also concluded Bush was not told
about the diversion of money from the weapons sales to the Contra
rebels.
   Donald Gregg, Bush's top foreign policy adviser, had extensive
knowledge about certain elements of the resupply operation for the
Contras, but did not tell Bush about it, the report said.
   ``The vice president said he did not know of the Contra resupply
operation,'' the congressional report said.
   Gregg testified that he was told about certain elements of the
resupply operation by former CIA agent Felix Rodriguez in August
1986. But Gregg said he never passed along his information to Bush
because he ``did not consider these facts worthy of the vice
president's attention.''

   Scores of birds known as waxwings have arrived
along the east coast of Britain, and an expert says they came from
the Soviet Union in search of food.
   Christopher Mead, a bird specialist with the British Trust for
Ornithology, said the waxwings seen on Sunday don't usually migrate
to Britain and came because of a sparse crop of the berries on
which they survive.
   Waxwings, which get their name from the red color at the tips of
their wings, were last seen in large numbers in Britain in the
1960s.
   Officials reported about 100 waxwings were first seen a week ago
in the Orkney and Shetland islands off the north coast of Scotland.

   Any Israeli citizen over age 18 is eligible to vote. There are
2.9 million registered voters, including 350,000 Arabs who live in
Israel. The country's total population is 4.4 million, including
750,000 Arabs. Included are 70,000 Jewish settlers who live in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip but are eligible to vote.
   Polls open at 7 a.m. (midnight EST Monday) and close at 10 p.m.

counted by hand.

<HEAD>THE GOVERNMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Israeli is a parliamentary democracy. The government is headed
by a prime minister traditionally chosen from the party with the
most seats in the Knesset. The prime minister forms a cabinet,
which must be approved by the Knesset.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PARTIES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Israelis vote for parties, not individual candidates. The number
of Knesset seats each wins depends on its proportion of the vote.
Each party makes up numbered lists of candidates, and those gaining
seats are chosen by their order on the list.
   Twenty-seven parties are running. The two major parties are the
right-wing Likud bloc headed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
the left-of-center Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   In Israel's history, neither major party has ever won an
absolute majority, meaning the government is always a coalition and
small parties have influence beyond their numbers.
   Labor and Likud each have three allied parties as likely
coalition partners. There also are eight religious parties which
use their seats as swing votes to gain backing for Jewish Orthodox
causes; two Arab parties; an Arab-Jewish party that favors creating
a Palestinian state, and eight others, most championing single
causes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OPINION POLLS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Most polls predict a close race, either with Likud and its
allies winning narrowly or a split vote that will again create a
Labor-Likud coalition such as has governed since the last election
in 1984. Then, neither major party could form a government without
the other.
   The polls are regarded as less than reliable because most are
sponsored by Labor or Likud. Also, most do not survey Arabs,
religious Jews, soldiers and residents of collective farms.

<HEAD>Dukakis Embraces Liberalism As Race With Bush Tightens</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush today scoffed at Michael Dukakis' weekend embrace of
the liberal label, calling it a ``miracle of miracles.'' Dukakis
said the Republican has stood ``on the wrong side'' of every issue
of importance to voters.
   With eight days left until Election Day, and some polls
indicating a race closer than earlier surveys suggested, Bush
shored up support in Kentucky and Missouri while Dukakis rallied
California supporters and said, ``I'm fired up.''
   Bush recalled that Dukakis had ``jumped all over me for using
the `L' word'' in their last debate in Los Angeles. ``Well,
speaking of my opponent, yesterday, miracle of miracles, headlines
read all about it, he's using the liberal label again,'' the
Republican nominee said in Louisville, Ky., today.
   Bush also brushed off Dukakis' invitation for a third debate,
saying the real debate should be between Dukakis and Dukakis, ``the
new left versus the old left.''
   At stops from Bakersfield to Stockton on Sunday, Dukakis told
voters, ``We need a president in the tradition, yes, the liberal
tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John Kennedy.''
   Dukakis dropped the ``L'' word _ as Bush and President Reagan
regularly call it _ during his appearances today but still referred
to the heritage of Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy.
   In San Jose, Dukakis said Bush has been ``on the wrong side of
every issue,'' singling out issues of importance especially to
women, such as pay equity, parental leave and health insurance.
   In a slap at Bush's long resume of appointed posts, Dukakis also
said, ``You can't inherit the White House, you have to earn the
right to be president of the United States.''
   Questioned by reporters about his decision to embrace the label
he has shunned for months, Dukakis said he comes from the liberal
tradition of ``presidents who were on the side of average
Americans, presidents who helped to build middle class America.''
   ``Harry Truman was a liberal who believed in balancing budgets
and that's the tradition I come from,'' the Massachusetts governor
said.
   Though the Dukakis campaign sought to characterize California,
with its 47 electoral votes, as a tossup based on their internal
polling, a new ABC News poll put Bush ahead, 51 percent to 44
percent. The poll of 510 likely voters was conducted Saturday and
Sunday.
   Bush stumped in Philadelphia's suburbs on Sunday and briefly
manned the phones at his campaign headquarters in Montgomery County.
   ``This is George Bush calling from the headquarters. We're
trying to get the vote out. I know you probably don't believe it,
but that's who it is,'' the GOP nominee said in one call.
   Bush also delivered a pep talk to staff members at the
headquarters, saying he and his wife, Barbara, plan ``to keep
running like we're 10 points behind. Nobody is going to out-work
us.''
   As part of a counteroffensive, the Dukakis campaign in Missouri
announced late Sunday that a free lunch with the homeless will be
held across the street from St. Louis' Union Station at the same
time as a Bush rally today.
   The lunch for clergy, veterans, the elderly and others is being
sponsored by the St. Louis Clergy Coalition, Students for Dukakis
and other organizations, the campaign said in a statement.
   Dukakis' running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, was focusing today on
his home state of Texas where a statewide poll released this
weekend showed Bush maintaining a strong lead.
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle was campaigning
in Michigan and Ohio.
   The latest nationwide poll, a Time Magazine survey published
today, found the Republican ticket leading Dukakis-Bentsen by 10
points, 50 percent to 40 percent.
   The survey of 1,096 probable voters was conducted Tuesday and
Wednesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three
percentage points.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the campaign thought
the race would tighten in the closing days of the campaign.
   ``I think it's to be expected as you get to the final days of
the campaign that you're going to see some tightening in this race,
but that's going to cause us to work harder,'' Fuller said.
   Buoyed by his campaign's tracking polls and some statewide
surveys indicating a closer race, Dukakis claimed that the battle
for the White House is far from over.
   ``You can sense it, you can feel it, you can taste it,'' he said.
   Crowds chanted ``Give 'em hell,'' and ``Tell it like it is,'' as
the Democratic nominee made his way through the California valley
by Amtrak train. A cheer also went up when Dukakis proclaimed
himself a liberal.
   In an interview with the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, taped Saturday
and scheduled to air tonight, the Massachusetts governor said he
was upset ith Bush's definition of a liberal and the
characteristics he tried to pin on his Democratic rival.
   ``The thing I object to is Mr. Bush's use of the term in a way
which I think is very deliberately designed to suggest that I and
people like me don't have a sense of values, that we're kind of
permissive, that anything goes. And anybody who knows me knows that
that's the farthest thing from who Mike Dukakis is,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poachers Kill Kenya's White Rhino Herd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poachers raided a special reserve at night
and slaughtered at least five white rhinoceroses, eliminating the
animals from Kenya's public lands, authorities said Monday.
   The massacre by the 30 poachers occurred Sunday night at Meru
National Park, east of snow-capped Mount Kenya and 140 miles
northeast of Nairobi, the capital, said Minister of Tourism and
Wildlife George Muhoho.
   Five rhinos were killed, he said. Several wildlife experts, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, put the number at six.
   Thirteen elephants also were gunned down in the last week in
different areas, the wildlife sources said.
   The killings came amid stepped-up anti-poaching efforts by the
government since August, when Muhoho revealed the slaughter of 92
elephants in the previous three months and the government launched
a highly publicized campaign to stop the killing.
   The white rhinos, which unlike the black rhino are not
indigenous to Kenya, were imported from South Africa about 20 years
ago and lived under guard in a special reserve in the park.
   ``People watched over them day and night,'' said one of the
sources. ``The rangers were wounded trying to defend them.''
   The poachers escaped after hacking off the rhinos' valuable
horns. One rhino horn can sell for up to $24,000 in the Far East,
where it is used to make traditional medicines, and in the Middle
East, where it is fashioned into ornamental handles for daggers.
   The white rhino's numbers have not been reduced as sharply as
have those of the black rhino, which were thought to number more
than 60,000 in the early 1970s. Today, there are thought to be
about 800 black rhino throughout Africa.
   Most of Africa's white rhinos live in South Africa, where
experts estimate the herd at about 3,000 strong. Twenty-five to 30
of the animals live in a private park in Solio Ranch, near the
equator southeast of Mount Kenya, according to the Daily Nation
newspaper.
   Both types of rhino are a rather dark gray, with their visible
differences lying mostly in horn size and lip shape.
   Kenya sent a paramilitary unit to Meru National Park to track
the rhinos' poachers, said a government wildlife source. He
declined to provide details.
   Gunmen in the last week slaughtered and hacked the tusks off
five elephants in southeastern Tsavo East National Park and eight
elephants in the Mathews Range in arid Samburu district 155 miles
north of Nairobi, the sources said.
   Their deaths bring to about 150 the number killed since April,
according to published data. Wildlife officials estimate the toll
is much higher.
   Studies by the Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program show
that in the past 15 years, Kenya's elephant population has dropped
85 percent. An aerial survey in February of Tsavo Park and its
environs found less than 5,500 elephants, down from 35,000 in 1974.
   Experts blame the intensifed slaughter on an all-time high of
ivory prices, which have climbed steadily since the early 1970s and
average about $82 per pound.

<TEXT>
   A fired-up Michael Dukakis campaigned
today as the political ally of women and young people, and said the
noisy welcome he received in California ``smells like victory to
me.''
   Taking a swipe at Vice President George Bush, who rejected his
invitation for an election-eve debate, the Democratic presidential
nominee declared that ``you can't inherit the White House, you have
to earn the right to be president of the United States.''
   Dukakis was greeted by loudly cheering supporters at the student
union building at San Jose State University on the second day of a
campaign swing through a state with 47 electoral votes, the most of
any state.
   ``It smells like victory to me,'' he said.
   Dukakis campaigned Sunday as a born-again liberal but omitted
the word from his San Jose speech today when he referred to the
heritage of Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy.
   Trying to attract wavering sources of traditional Democratic
strength, Dukakis said the Republican ticket of Bush and Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana had been ``on the wrong side of every issue of
special importance to American women.''
   If people believed in such issues as pay equity, health
insurance and parental leave, he said, ``then we're on your side.''
   He also said he was separated from Bush by his stands on the
environment and Supreme Court appointments.
   Dukakis quoted Quayle as telling a 12-year-old girl that ``if
she were raped and made pregnant by her father, the government had
a right to force her to bear that child.''
   The audience erupted in loud boos.
   As he left the building, Dukakis was cheered by several thousand
people, mostly students, who stood outside the hall. ``You're fired
up,'' he told them.
   Asked about his own mood, Dukakis replied, ``I'm fired up.''
   As he toured the lush San Joaquin Valley by train Sunday, the
Massachusetts governor said confidently that his message ``is
getting through'' and that ``this race is tightening up'' with
polls showing he is narrowing Bush's lead in several key states.
   ``You can sense it, you can feel it, you can taste it,'' he said.
   Campaign aides said an internal poll showed that Bush's former
10-point lead in California had shrunk to a dead heat.
   As he traveled by Amtrak train, Dukakis predicted an upset
victory on Nov. 8 and drew shouts of ``Give 'em hell,'' and ``Tell
it like it is,'' from crowds that gathered under cloudless skies.
   From Bakersfield to Hanford and then Fresno, Merced, Modesto and
Stockton, the train passed through the rich agricultural valley,
past fields of cotton and vineyards and orchards.
   Accompanying the candidate were Sen. Alan Cranston and Reps.
Tony Coelho and Robert Matsui, as well as a carload of financial
contributors.
   ``The pollsters and the press have been trying to tell us the
election is over,'' said Cranston. ``We'll show them on Election
Day.''
   Dukakis took up the same theme.
   ``It won't be the pollsters and the pundits who vote on Election
Day,'' he said. ``It will be you.''
   The candidate said his improved standing in polls is the result
of work by ``a wonderful network of volunteers across the country''
and because ``our message of standing on the side of working
Americans is getting through.''
   Suddenly, he no longer shied away from the ``L-word.''
   ``We need a president in the tradition, yes, the liberal
tradition of Franklin Roois the outgoing vice president.
Congress reasoned that a vice president only has to move down the
hall.
   Regardless of who wins, the transition headquarters will be
ready for immediate occupancy. By Election Day, telephones will be
installed, copying machines will be plugged in and furniture will
be in place.
   Stationery already had been ordered with a politically neutral
heading of ``Office of the President-elect.''
   Along with the government offices, the building at 1825
Connecticut N.W. houses a drug store, Chinese restaurant and
Pakistani bank. Across the street is a bath house that once was a
massage parlor.
   Representatives of the Bush and Dukakis campaigns have worked
with the General Services Administration, the federal housekeeping
agency, on arrangements in the building. Both say they don't need
all of the three full floors and a part of a fourth that have been
offered.
   In the Dukakis campaign, transition director Marcia Hale has put
her planning on hold as her candidate tries to stage a political
comeback.
   In the Bush campaign, where the rule is to avoid overconfidence,
transition director Chase Untermeyer is reluctant to talk about his
months of preparation.
   ``I'm in no position to answer because that's in the new world.
It won't dawn until after he (Bush) happens to be elected,'' said
Untermeyer, who works out of the Republican National Committee
headquarters.
   If the polls are correct and Bush wins, he will face a situation
that is unique in the last 152 years of political history.
   Not since 1836 has a sitting vice president been elected to the
presidency. That was when Martin Van Buren moved up from understudy
to president.
   How would it affect Bush's relationship with Reagan? Would
Reagan begin to defer to Bush? Who would be in charge?
   ``The great historic example was in 1932 when the banking crisis
was hard upon the land,'' Untermeyer recalled. ``President
(Herbert) Hoover asked President-elect (Franklin D.) Roosevelt what
he aimed to do, and Roosevelt declined to answer because he felt
that was improper _ that the president is the president until he
leaves office.
   ``Obviously their relationship was marked by a great deal of
bitterness because Roosevelt trounced him during the election but
that offer was declined,'' Untermeyer said.
   Even though there would be no bitterness between Reagan and
Bush, Untermeyer noted that, ``The president-elect (is the one who)
gets all the attention. The incumbent president is the one that
people have to be reminded of.''
   Nevertheless, Untermeyer says, ``The vice president has shown
throughout his vice presidency that he has held the president in
the highest esteem and honors him as the president of the United
States and will until noon on the 20th of January.
   ``And I can't believe that even though, as history suggests, the
fullest, brightest lights are going to be put on him (Bush) during
what they used to call the interregnum that he will in any way
appear to take that light from the president until he himself is
president,'' said Untermeyer.
   However, he said that if Bush takes office on Jan. 20, ``It is a
new administration ... It would not be Ronald Reagan's third term.
It would be George Bush's first term.''

<HEAD>Superpowers Meet to Discuss Krasnoyarsk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top U.S. and Soviet arms control officials met
Monday at the Soviets' request to discuss the Krasnoyarsk radar in
Siberia which the United States says violates the Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty.
   The delegations, headed by William Burns, U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency director, and Viktor Karpov, the head of the
arms control desk at the Soviet foreign ministry, met at the Soviet
diplomatic mission, said a U.S. spokesman speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the meeting had been requested by the Soviets and that
the talks were expected to last ``a few days.''
   ``Our purpose in these talks is to listen to the Soviet
proposals and to clarify Soviet positions on actions that they are
prepared to take to correct the Krasnoyarsk problem,'' said the
spokesman.
   The Soviet government announced last week that it was giving the
controversial radar site to the Soviet Academy of Sciences for use
as a civilian-run international space research center.
   President Reagan, in a speech in Los Angeles on Friday, said the
United States is listening to what the Soviets have to say about
Krasnoyarsk, but the U.S. position remains unchanged.
   The United States has said that the Soviets must dismantle the
Krasnoyarsk facility in order to comply with the ABM treaty. U.S.
officials maintain the radar violates the treaty, which limits each
side's anti-ballistic missile facilities, because of its location
and orientation.
   The two sides met in Geneva in August for their third periodic
review of the treaty. At the close of the one-week session, the
U.S. side issued a statement saying it ws not satisfied with the
Soviet response to U.S. concerns about the radar, and threatened to
take action that could terminate or suspend the ABM treaty.

   The United States today relaxed trade, travel
and diplomatic restrictions against North Korea to support South
Korean efforts at easing tensions on the peninsula.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
will encourage unofficial non-governmental visits from North Korea
in academics, sports, culture and other areas.
   Redman also said financial regulations are being revised to
permit group travel by Americans on a case-by-case basis. American
diplomats will be allowed substantive contact with North Korean
diplomats for the first time in almost a year, he said.
   In addition, the spokesman said, commercial exports of
humanitarian goods to North Korea will be allowed on a limited
basis. Currently, humanitarian items must be donated.
   Redman stressed that general commercial trade will still be
illegal and that North Korea ``remains on our list of states which
support or are engaged in international terrorism.
   ``Its behavior in this area is something we will continue to
scrutinize closely,'' he said.
   The moves are a complement to efforts by South Korean President
Roh Tae Woo, who has called for a north-south summit meeting and a
resumption of trade between the two Koreas as part of an attempt to
ease tensions.
   Roh met with President Reagan 10 days ago and suggested the
United States act in coordination with South Korea's own moves.
   North Korea is one of the few countries in the world with which
the United States has no diplomatic relations, and it has been the
target of a highly restrictive U.S. trade embargo.
   In a gesture to the north in early 1987, the administration
removed a prohibition on diplomatic contacts, but then restored it
after what officials said was convincing evidence of North Korean
complicity in the November 1987 bombing of a South Korean passenger
plane that killed all 115 aboard.
   Since Roh's visit, the State Department has been working with
the Treasury Department and other agencies to carry out the
paperwork necessary to implement the expected changes, the
officials said.
   Historically, South Korea has, with U.S. help, tried to isolate
North Korea, but Roh has altered that policy with his call for
north-south trade and for an unprecedented summit meeting with
President Kim Il-Sung.
   As U.S. officials see it, Roh's moves reflect increased South
Korean self-confidence based on the country's growing economic
strength and the success of the Olympic games held in September in
Seoul.
   North Korea made no attempt to disrupt the games, which Roh took
as an encouraging sign. He proposed the summit shortly after the
games concluded, reflecting, in part, strong domestic pressure to
make an effort that could lead to the eventual peaceful
reunification of the peninsula.
   The officials said recent developments have left North Korea
more isolated than before. Its principal backers, China and the
Soviet Union, ignored North Korea's appeals for a boycott of the
Olympics.
   Only Cuba and a handful of other leftist countries supported the
North Korean call.

<TEXT>
   Groups of workers in separate parts of
the state claimed to hold two of three winning tickets for a $60.8
million lotto jackpot said to be the world's largest lottery prize.
   ``The lady who found we had a winning ticket screamed,'' said
Carrie Dragon, a member of the group of 14 workers at Fallbrook
Hospital in San Diego and a friend who attended a party Saturday
night to watch the winning numbers drawn.
   ``Then everybody started dreaming about what we were going to do
with the money,'' Dragon, a 38-year-old pharmacy technician, said
Sunday. ``I'm going to set up trust funds for my four kids and pay
off bills. But for Thanksgiving, we're (the group) all going to
Hawaii or someplace like that.''
   The second group of 25 workers at a Sears appliance service
department in Sacramento were said today to have a second ticket,
while the third was claimed to be held by a couple from Westminster
in Orange County in Southern California.
   Lottery officials scheduled but then cancelled a news conference
with the 25 Sacramento winners. Lottery spokeswoman Kim Rendahl
said the workers then decided they didn't want the publicity and
had to return to work.
   Taylor said he was uncertain whether tickets could be checked in
time for a news conference with the San Diego group today, but that
a news conference with the potential Westminster winner was
possible.
   Lottery spokesman Bob Taylor said he could not confirm that the
claimants held winning tickets until the stubs were verified,
probably later today.
   Each winning ticket is worth a third of the jackpot, or nearly
$20.3 million, to be paid over two decades. The winning numbers
were 5, 20, 26, 28, 32 and 39.
   Surinder Sanghera, owner of Sangheras House of Liquors in
Sacramento where a winning ticket was sold, said it was bought by a
pool of 25 Sears employees. ``They are regulars,'' he said. ``I
think they've been buying here since the lotto began.''
   A woman answering the phone at the Sears service center this
morning said that she and 24 other workers there were joint
winners. She added, ``I'm pretty excited about it. Wouldn't anybody
be?'' before hanging up the phone without giving her name.
   The Los Angeles Times and Orange County Register reported today
that the Westminster winner is Ron Smith, a 45-year-old production
supervisor. Smith said he had bought five lottery tickets.
   ``We're very common, real people,'' Smith's wife, Linda, told
the Register. ``We have our friends and this is our house. We're
not going to move.''
   The two now earn about $40,000 a year. Smith said he'll quit his
job at Shell Oil so he and his wife can travel. He went to work
Sunday and told his co-workers.
   ``They thought I was kidding,'' he said. ``Then they decided I
was serious.''
   The group at the hospital in Fallbrook purchased $600 worth of
tickets, with each member of the group kicking in $15 apiece,
Dragon said.
   She said all agreed they would split what winnings came from the
``Quick Pick'' tickets. ``Quick Pick'' means that the numbers on
the $1 tickets were selected at random by a computerized lotto
terminal.
   The tickets were purchased at a Circle K convenience store, she
said. Lottery officials verified that the winning ticket in
Fallbrook was purchased in a Circle K.
   Dragon said the winning ticket was placed in a bank vault
Sunday. If verified, it would be worth more than $67,000 a year
before taxes for 20 years to each of the 15.
   Each of the three winning tickets is worth $20,296,175,
one-third of the $60,888,525 jackpot, said lottery spokeswoman
Susan Kossack.
   The prize was the world's largest lottery jackpot, Taylor said.
   The previous world record was $56 million in Spain's El Gordo
lottery in 1983, according to Sam Valenza, publisher of Lottery
Players magazine in Moorestown, N.J.
   The previous North American record was a $55.16 million Florida
lottery jackpot last month, but that prize went to a single winner.

   For the past eight years in Iraq,
tomorrow's weather literally has been anybody's guess.
   On Monday, however, the forecasters were back.
   The government pulled all weather forecasters off the domestic
airwaves and newspaper pages when the war with Iran started in
September 1980. The ban stemmed from a fear the information could
be used by the enemy.
   The forecast called for clear skies and moderate northwesterly
winds in the northern and central areas, while the southern part
will be partly cloudy to rainy with southeasterly winds. The
temperature is expected to be 77 degrees in Baghdad, 72 in Mosul
and 82 in Basra.

   The international community, including
private U.S. groups, is sending tons of aid to Nicaragua in
response to the leftist government's plea for help to the victims
of Hurricane Joan.
   About 200,000 people were left homeless after the hurricane
swept a path of destruction through Nicaragua on Oct. 22. The
torrential rains and winds downed bridges and destroyed crops, with
the Atlantic Coast and the south-central regions suffering the
worst damage.
   The Sandinista government called on the international community
for urgent aid.
   Cuba, Nicaragua's closest ally, sent thousands of tons of
supplies from Havana to Bluefields, the hardest-hit coastal city.
   The first plane carrying U.S. aid arrived Saturday night at
Managua's A.C. Sandino International Airport from Tucson, Ariz.,
with 30 tons of food, medicine, blankets, clothes, tents and
building materials, according to Karen Glenn, a missionary with the
Evangelical Committee for Aid to Development, an umbrella group for
Protestant organizations.
   Mrs. Glenn said the donations came from Walk In Peace, a group
started in Georgia by the Rev. Don Mosley. A plane from the
U.S.-based World Vision landed Sunday with 20 tons of goods, she
said.
   A third plane with U.S. aid was to arrive on Monday, Mrs. Glenn
said.
   The Reagan administration imposed a trade embargo in 1985,
charging that Nicaragua threatens U.S. national security by
supporting communism. The ban bars Americans from exporting goods,
except humanitarian aid, to Nicaragua and prohibits imports.
   The Dominican Republic shipped 35 tons of goods, including rice.
   El Salvador, a staunch American ally, sent two flights of goods
over the weekend from the Salvadoran Red Cross.
   A plane was expected Monday from the Soviet Union, Nicaragua's
largest economic and military backer. Barricada, the official
Sandinista newspaper, said the Soviets also were sending a boatload
of supplies.
   Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Mexico and Panama sent emergency
goods last week.
   Also last week, Spain sent food, medicine and blankets and the
British Red Cross supplied more than 3 tons of goods.
   Pledges for aid came from North Korea, Italy, France and
Uruguay, the government said.
   The total amount of aid was not known.

   The Lenin shipyard in Gdansk has
symbolized the struggle for free unions since the tumult of August
1980, when a 36-year-old electrician named Lech Walesa led the
strike that created Solidarity.
   The yard once was a showcase of industry in communist Poland,
but never recovered after the martial law crackdown of Dec. 13,
1981, that crushed Solidarity, the first independent union in the
Soviet bloc.
   Solidarity was recognized as a legal union after the 18-day
strike led by Walesa, who still works at yard named for the founder
of the Soviet state. It was formally outlawed in 1982 and, like the
shipyard that spawned it, never regained the power of that heady
first summer.
   Officials now have decided to close the shipyard Dec. 1, citing
the need to discontinue money-losing state enterprises.
   Baltic coast shipyards have been hotbeds of political activity
since the 1970s. The killing by police of scores of workers during
food-price riots in December 1970 inspired a generation of workers
to demand free unions.
   The immediate cause of the 1980 strike at the Lenin yard, which
began Aug. 14, was the dismissal in July of a popular woman who
worked as a crane operator. Walesa, who had been fired in 1976,
vaulted the fence into the shipyard to lead it.
   Soon after it was legalized, Solidarity claimed 10 million
members, including thousands belonging to the ruling Communist
Party. When it was banned in October 1982, Solidarity maintained a
leadership structure underground.
   Workers at the Lenin shipyard joined strikes in May and August
of this year, the worst in Poland since 1981, and authorities began
to suggest closing the operation.
   At its height of prosperity in the 1970s, the yard employed more
than 15,000 workers. A billboard on the grounds lists 27 countries
for which it has built nearly 900 ships since World War II.
   Much of its equipment has become rusted during the bad times,
and only about 10,000 employees remain. Many ardent supporters of
Solidarity were fired or have drifted away since martial law to
higher-paying jobs in construction or other fields.
   A new generation of militant young workers has taken up the
Solidarity banner, however, pressing bread-and-butter issues like
pay and housing.
   Even when the shipyard is closed, the site will remain a strong
symbol of the free union. Outside the gates are three metal crosses
130 feet tall erected by Solidarity in its heyday to honor the
workers slain in 1970.

   Actors Sidney Poitier and Estelle Parsons
honored actor and director Frederick O'Neal in a ceremony that also
marked what would have been the 90th birthday of actor, singer,
lawyer, athlete and activist Paul Robeson.
   In Sunday night's celebration at the Shubert Theatre, Poitier
and Parsons draped a kente cloth worn by the kings of West Africa
around O'Neal's shoulders and called him ``one of our venerated
elders.''
   O'Neal, 83, whose career dates to 1927 and who co-founded the
American Negro Theater, was given a special Robeson Award.
   ``I accept this award as sort of a command: `Now go out and earn
it,''' O'Neal told the audience, which gave the AFL-CIO vice
president and president emeritus of Actors Equity a standing
ovation.
   Robeson, who died in 1976, was among the most famous and highest
paid actors of his day, renowned for his performances in, among
other things, ``Othello'' and ``Show Boat.''
   But Robeson's popularity suffered in the 1950s because of his
open admiration for the Soviet Union.
   Poitier told the audience that Robeson the political radical had
counseled him against being too radical.
   ``He had an impact on every selection I ever made as an actor.
He never wanted me to lose my credibility,'' Poitier said.

Monday.
   Dimitra Liani, a 34-year-old Olympic Airways flight attendant,
married Alex Kapopoulos, 48, a former prominent member of the
Revolutionary Greek Communist Party, in a civil ceremony in 1982.
They have no children.
   They parted after working together on a 1986 television series
promoting equality of the sexes.
   Ms. Liani presented the program, which featured the premier as
the first guest. Kapopoulos was the producer and still works for
state-run channel ERT-1.
   Papandreou, 69, said before undergoing open-heart surgery in
London last month that he intends to divorce his American wife,
Margaret. He is expected to marry Ms. Liani, according to officials
in his Panhellenic Socialist Movement.
   Mrs. Papandreou, 66, who heads a left-wing Greek feminist

when he has fully recovered. The couple have four grown children

   A mother who claimed a wild dog ate her
baby and battled for eight years against a wrongful murder charge
says American actress Meryl Streep's portrayal of her in a new
movie is ``painfully perfect.''
   Lindy Chamberlain and her husband, Michael, praised Streep in a
televised interview for a ``truly amazing job'' in the soon-to-be
released film ``Evil Angels,'' which will premier in the United
States as ``A Cry In The Dark.''
   The couple was interviewed on Australia's ``60 Minutes'' program
on the eve of the film's release this week in Australia.
   The film centers on the 1980 disappearance of the Chamberlain's
6-week-old daughter Azaria during a camping trip to the Outback,
and her mother's much-publicized murder trial and imprisonment.
   It also stars Sam Neill as Michael Chamberlain, who resigned as
a pastor for the Seventh Day Adventist Church during his wife's
trial.
   ``In some ways it (the film) was good because it helps clear up
a lot of points,'' she said. ``But in another way I didn't like it
because it was my life on the screen.''
   Her husband said it was a ``true story totally on line with what
we know.''
   ``I felt extremely emotional,'' he said. ``One minute I was in
tears, the next minute I was laughing.''

   Kokomo, Ind., is, no doubt, a fine city,
but it's hardly the tropical paradise of the Beach Boys' song
``Kokomo.'' So Keys businessmen are creating pieces of the
fictitious island to satisfy the Kokomo craze.
   The song, which climbed to the top of Billboard's pop singles'
chart Monday, mentions various Caribbean islands as well as Key
Largo and the Florida Keys and declares that Kokomo is the place
``you want to go to get away from it all.''
   Unfortunately for interested vacationers, songwriters Mike Love,
Terry Melcher, John Phillips and Scott MacKenzie dreamed up the
alluring isle for the song from the motion picture ``Cocktail.''
   Some would-be visitors, not finding Kokomo on any maps, have
called chambers of commerce in the Keys looking for it.
   ``One caller said she wanted her wedding ceremony on Kokomo
Island and asked us to help make arrangements,'' said Ginna Thomas,
executive director for the Key Largo Chamber of Commerce.
   Not ones to miss any opportunity, resort operators are trying to
capitalize on Kokomo's fame.
   In Key West, Marriott's Casa Marina has renamed its beach Kokomo

   ``We felt if people wanted Kokomo, then what the heck, let's
give them Kokomo,'' said Joe Roth, managing owner of Holiday Isle
Resort in Islamorada. ``So we named our poolside bar Kokomo and
developed a tropical drink with the same name.''
   The full name, by the way, is Kokomo at Margaritaville. As with
Kokomo, there is no Margaritaville, featured in a hit song by Jimmy
Buffett, the Keys' resident music star.

   Shadowy figures flit through the halls after
dark. Burglar alarms go off for no apparent reason. Things go bump
in the night.
   Sound like a Halloween haunted house? Actually, it's the
Washington State Historical Society Museum.
   Through the years, nighttime security guards have reported
ghostly figures stalking halls and noises in deserted parts of the
museum, which was built shortly after the turn of the century.
   ``There's nothing worse than closing this place up at night,''
said Steve Campion, who works in the gift shop.
   Campion says any creaks and thumps probably come from settling
of the building, but he admits that he would be reluctant to spend
a night in the place.
   Registrar Mary Rash said a security guard who retired in 1986
often reported seeing a lady wearing a brown dress in the darkened
hallways. The same man, who died the month after he retired, also
said he saw the ghost of Mary Todd Lincoln playing with her two
sons near an Abraham Lincoln display.
   Security officer Michael Shaudis said he was told that shortly
after a new alarm system was installed several years ago, a motion
detector sounded an alarm in a locked room where the Lincoln
display was stored, for reasons that remain unexplained.
   Ms. Rash, hesitant to say she believes the museum is haunted,
nonetheless does not believe the guard fabricated his ghostly tale.
   Unexplained circumstances continue even with the latest
technology.
   Images of Victorian-clad mannequins from a display somehow were
burned into video security screens.
   When a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy known as Ankh Unnofoi was
moved last fall from the first-floor atrium to a dark cranny on the
second floor to make room for another exhibit, plans called for
installation of a light at the new location. The first light bulb
fizzled. So did the second.
   A new lighting base and bulb were installed, and all was well
until the light was pointed at the mummy. The bulb immediately went
out, Shaudis said.
   ``Obviously, it's probably the contacts in the track,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, to this day, the mummy remains unlighted.

<HEAD>China's First Bankruptcy Law Goes into Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's first bankruptcy law takes effect
Tuesday, creating a legal framework for closing thousands of
inefficient state-run enterprises.
   Economists say that in its initial stages, the law will be used
more as a threat to debt-ridden firms and few will be closed. Since
1986, when bankruptcy experiments started in several cities, only
two small state-owned businesses have been closed.
   The new law is part of overall reforms designed to end lifetime
employment, tie wages and benefits to work performance, and
redefine the state's relationship to business.
   It was passed in December 1986 with the stipulation it would
take effect three months after another new law, which gives
factories greater operating autonomy.
   The bankruptcy legislation could affect the nearly 7,000
state-run companies running in the red.
   These companies _ 17 percent of the nation's state-run
businesses _ lost almost $1 billion in the first half of 1988, up
27 percent from the same period in 1987. The government will spend
about $10.8 billion this year to prop up the ailing industries.
   The bankruptcy law applies to firms that have suffered ``heavy
losses,'' but does not pinpoint which companies should be the
target of closures.
   Under the law, the state will auction off the fixed assets of
enterprises declared insolvent. Efforts will also be made to merge
money losers with stronger businesses. The efficient firms will
have the right to reassign workers or change the product line of
the plant taken over.
   The official China Daily said Sunday the introduction of
bankruptcy, once regarded as a symbol of capitalist decay, is
``sending a shiver down the spines of directors and workers in
money-losing enterprises.''
   It quoted Zhang Yinjie of the Beijing Economic Planning
Commission as saying his office was not sure ``how to determine
what kind of enterprises should go bankrupt and then, having
decided that, how to bring them to court.''
   Zhang also brought up the labor issue, saying, ``What if the
workers who have been fired throng around the government buildings,
raising signs and chanting `I want to work, I am hungry.'''
   China, which only recently acknowledged that unemployment
existed in the socialist state, puts unemployment at 2 percent.
Chinese economists say the jobless rate will hit 4 percent or 5
percent as factories trim excess laborers or go broke.
   Despite new statutes giving factory managers the right to hire
and fire workers, few people have lost their jobs and large scale
layoffs are rare.
   Under an unemployment insurance program being tried in several
cities, enterprises pay into a relief fund and laid-off workers are
eligible for benefits of 75 percent of their salary for the first
12 months and 50 percent for the second 12 months.
   China in the past month has called a temporary halt to price
reforms and reasserted controls over bank loans and foreign trade
in the face of a badly overheated economy and an inflation rate of
more than 20 percent.
   However, Chinese leaders insist they remain committed to the
10-year program of switching to an economy directed by market
forces rather than central planning.
   The government appears to be pushing ahead with measures to
restructure the state ownership system, such as the selling of
shares in state factories, auctioning off smaller state firms to
collective or private businesses, instituting the contract system
and introducing bankruptcy.

<HEAD>Californians Will Decide Expensive Ballot Contest over Auto
Premiums</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this state infatuated with cars but
infuriated by soaring auto premiums, the insurance industry has
raised a record $42.6 million for a campaign to defeat
consumer-backed ballot proposals that would slash rates by at least
20 percent.
   The contest over five conflicting auto insurance reform measures
on Nov. 8 ballots has grown into the most expensive political
struggle ever waged outside a presidential contest.
   All told, a combined $60 million has been poured into a
political war pitting consumer advocates, insurers and trial
lawyers against one another.
   Industry analysts express fears that support for the tougher
rate-cutting measures could spawn a nationwide ``insurance revolt.''
   More immediately, if Californians approve more than one of the
five conflicting measures, it could likely trigger court battles
that would produce unexpected hybrids.
   But polls show Californians leaning toward approval of
Proposition 103, the deepest and broadest of the measures on the
ballot.
   Proposition 103, supported by consumer advocate Ralph Nader,
would lower almost all rates by an immediate 20 percent below
November 1987 rates. It would require an additional 20 percent cut
in insurance rates for good drivers.
   It also would give an elected insurance commissioner control
over future rate increases, limit use of territorial rating to set
auto insurance premiums and subject the industry to state antitrust
and unfair business practice laws.
   The rush to reform auto insurance was spurred by rates which
have risen 40 percent between mid-1985 and the end of 1987,
according to legislative studies.
   The insurance industry claims its profits in the state are slim
to none.
   It placed rival Proposition 104 on the ballot, a 24,000-word
measure that would create a no-fault system, temporarily cut
personal injury premiums by an average 20 percent, and prohibit
recovery for pain-and-suffering damages unless injuries result in
death or permanent and serious disability.
   ``The key is getting a good no-fault law passed. And the bargain
that the insurance industry is offering you ... is a good no-fault
law .... I think it's a bargain you ought to strike with them,''
says University of Virginia professor Jeffrey O'Connell, an expert
on accident law who is backing Proposition 104.
   A second industry-backed measure, Proposition 106, would limit
the contingency fees attorneys could charge their clients. The fees
are the payment an attorney gets from a settlement won for a client
who cannot afford the regular pay-as-you-go arrangement.
   The industry says high contingency fees drive up insurance
rates. But foes say the measure would make it difficult for victims
of accidents to hire qualified legal counsel, while placing no
limits on fees paid to lawyers working for insurance companies.
   Nader claims the insurance industry placed its rival measures on
the ballot as a tactic to muddy the water.
   ``When Proposition 103 first hit the streets to get signatures
(to qualify it for the ballot), the insurance companies realized
they would have a very difficult time defeating it, so they put ...
their propositions on the ballot to confuse the public and their
ads are furthering that end,'' Nader said.
   Adding to the confusion is Proposition 100, financed largely by
trial lawyers and sponsored by consumer groups, which would
immediately roll back good drivers' rates by 20 percent below those
charged on Jan. 1, 1988. The measure also would prohibit limits on
lawyers' fees.
   A fifth measure, Proposition 101, sponsored by Democratic
Assemblyman Richard Polanco of Los Angeles and Coastal Insurance
Co., would cut certain premiums by up to 35 percent by capping
attorney fees and injury claims. Trial lawyers and consumer groups
argue that the measure would leave loopholes for insurers to raise
rates.
   Industry officials insist that Propositions 100 and 103 would
drive up rates in all but four Southern California counties because
companies could no longer use territorial rating and therefore
would no longer be able to charge Los Angeles residents for the
high cost of claims there.
   Proponents counter that their measures would not end territorial
rating, but would force insurers to justify it.
   The industry also says many companies would abandon California
in the face of rate cuts in Propositions 100 and 103, but
supporters term such threats scare tactics.

<TEXT>
   A team of eight U.S. inspectors left East Germany
on Monday after completing inspections of missile sites covered
under a superpower treaty scrapping intermediate-range nuclear
weapons, the state-run media reported.
   The men left after inspecting former Soviet nuclear missile
sites near Leipzig, Communist East Germany's ADN news agency said.
   The team had arrived Sunday to determine if the Soviet SS-20
missiles had been removed, ADN said.
   Soviet inspectors have conducted inspections at several U.S.
missile sites in West Germany since the treaty was signed in
December.
   The Soviet Union began removing its missiles from East Germany
and Czechoslovakia in February, before the U.S. Senate had ratified
the treaty.
   Under terms of the treaty, the Soviet Union and the United
States agreed to eliminate all land-based, intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   The treaty allows for inspections by both sides to verify its
terms.

   Prisons don't have to supply free prayer
shawls, sermon tapes or religious books to inmates, the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday.
   The court upheld U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice's
dismissal as frivolous Donald Ray Frank's lawsuit against the Texas
Department of Corrections.
   Frank, who is Jewish, claimed his freedom of religion was
violated because the department wouldn't give him religious
materials including six books, a prayer shawl and sermon tapes.
   The 5th Circuit noted that Frank does not claim he is not
allowed to worship or that he is discriminated against because he
is Jewish, or that the corrections department won't let him get the
things he wants on his own.

   Emperor Hirohito received another blood transfusion
Monday after his blood pressure fell, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old monarch, listed in stabile condition, discharged
some blood early in the day but doctors waited until afternoon to
administer a transfusion of nearly a pint, said palace spokesman
Kenji Maeda.
   Hirohito was recovering from a serious weekend setback. He
received 3.8 pints of blood from late Saturday to Sunday evening _
the largest transfusion since he fell sick from internal bleeding
43 days ago.
   With Monday's transfusion, Hirohito has received more than 32
pints of blood since his illness began.
   Doctors consider the transfusions routine.
   Hirohito, the world's longest reigning monarch, has been
bedridden and fed intravenously since the crisis began.
   Maeda said doctors were not ``particularly concerned'' by the
drop in blood pressure.
   It fell to 114 over 36 in the morning, but rose to 124 over 62,
roughly what it was Sunday night, Maeda said. Early yesterday, it
had dropped to a dangerously low 84 over 34. A healthy person's
blood pressure is about 120 over 80.
   The emperor was fully conscious Monday, talking to the five
physicians who attend him on a 24-hour basis, according to Maeda.
   He received visits from his two sons, Crown Prince Akihito and
Prince Hitachi, and other relatives.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of farmers camped on a road to
the presidential palace ended their weeklong protest Monday, saying
the government will consider their demands for higher crop prices.
   Their withdrawal came soon after Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
addressed a party rally in memory of his slain mother, former
premier Indira Gandhi.
   The rally of the ruling Congress Party was to be held at the
site of the farmers' protest but was shifted to a park in front of
the 17th-century Red Fort, about 3{ miles from the presidential
palace.
   ``We have shown our strength,'' said Mahavir Singh, one of the
farmers' leaders who spoke to reporters as hundreds of tractors
drove down the Rajpath or Avenue of Kings and out of the city. Many
farmers viewed their protest as a success because it forced a new
venue on the Congress rally.
   Mahender Singh Tikait, president of the Indian Farmers' Union,
called off the protest. He said the government has assured a
farmers' delegation that their demands will be considered.
   Police said at least 40,000 farmers camped on Rajpath since last
Monday. Most slept under the shade of their tractors by day and
burned fires of cow dung to keep warm at night.
   ``Their protest became meaningless after they forced the
Congress to shift their rally,'' said Ajay Aggarwal, a police
officer posted at the sit-in site. But the farmers say they will
continue a non-cooperation movement and refuse to pay taxes until
government assurances become concrete offers, according to Mahavir
Singh. Among demands are that farmers get free electricity.
   ``We are happy with what we have achieved,'' Singh said. ``If
the government does not honor its assurances we can always come
back. And if we come back, we won't leave.''
   At least 500,000 people gathered on the dusty grounds at the
Congress Party rally.
   During a 45-minute speech delivered in Hindi, Gandhi repeatedly
told the crowd that his party had ushered in an agricultural
``green revolution'' and was trying to help farmers.
   Gandhi did not specifically refer to the farmers' demands.
   The rally was called to commemorate the fourth anniversary of
the assassination of Indira Gandhi, who led the party for nearly
two decades.

   Eli Stutzman, convicted of abandoning the
body of his 9-year-old son, will be sent to Texas to face a murder
charge, a judge ruled Monday.
   Lancaster County District Judge Earl Witthoff granted Texas
temporary custody of Stutzman to face the charge in the 1985 death
of his former roommate.
   Stutzman, 38, was sentenced in January in Thayer County District
Court after pleading guilty to two misdemeanors related to the
death of his son Danny, whose body was found Dec. 24, 1985.
   Stutzman is serving a one-year sentence for abandoning a human
body and a six-month term for concealing a death.
   On July 18, Texas authorities indicted Stutzman in the murder of
Glenn Pritchett, 24, whose body was found near Austin on May 12,
1985.
   Assistant Nebraska Attorney General William Howland said Monday
that because Stutzman will complete his Nebraska sentence Dec. 15,
he probably will not be returned to Nebraska.
   Howland said Stutzman will be transferred to Texas as soon as
all the paperwork is processed and arrangements are made.
   Danny died while he and his father were driving to Ohio from
Wyoming. According to authorities, Stutzman left his son's body in
a ditch along a road near Chester and a motorist discovered it.
   Townspeople buried him a few months later and his identity
remained a mystery until Reader's Digest published a story on the
case in its December 1987 issue. A reader thought the boy might be
Danny and contacted authorities.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure of Cuba and Angola
to respond to a U.S.-mediated compromise plan have delayed
Tuesday's target date to start granting independence to South-West
Africa, reports said Monday.
   The independent South African Press Association said an official
U.S. announcement ``is expected to be made soon,'' saying South
Africa would not meet its Tuesday target to begin withdrawing from
the territory, popularly called Namibia.
   The withdrawal was to lead to June 1 independence elections
supervised by the United Nations, which Pretoria defied to continue
its 73-year rule of Namibia.
   South Africa set the Tuesday date and the government's official
stance Monday was that the target holds, but it would not be
responsible if other parties were not ready.
   South African newspapers have reported recently that President
P.W. Botha is seeking to begin the independence process on Jan. 1,
1989, since it became clear Tuesday's deadline would not be met.
   ``We're prepared to move at any time,'' said Louis Pienaar,
South Africa's administrator for the territory.
   But South Africa's proposal was contingent on an agreement for
the departure of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting the Marxist
government in Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and U.S. mediators have held periodic
talks since May, but have been unable to set a timetable for Cuban
troops to withdraw. No new date has been set to resume negotiations.
   The South African agency said that in New York early this month,
U.S. mediator Chester Crocker had asked for responses to the
compromise plan by Oct. 12. Crocker is Undersecretary of State for
African Affairs.
   ``South Africa, according to informed sources here, met the
deadline, but the other two have not yet responded,'' SAPA reported
from Pretoria.
   It said the U.S. plan called for half the Cubans to leave Angola
before elections in Namibia and the remainder to move north of the
15th parallel. This would distance them from the Namibian border so
they could not support South-West Africa People's Organization
guerrillas who have been fighting South African rule for more than
two decades.
   The second stage, SAPA reported, would involve reducing the
Cuban strength to one-fourth its present strength by the end of the
first year. Remaining Cuban troops would leave by the end of the
second year.

   Police are concerned about their record _
their record of satisfaction, that is.
   To see how they're doing, the department sent questionnaires to
68 people who were victims, arrested, or given summonses.
   The two-page survey, mailed Sept. 1, asks such questions as:
``Understanding that this may have been a difficult situation, were
you generally satisfied with the Scituate Police Department?''
   The survey, named ``Project Image,'' is based on a program
developed by a Florida police department.
   Replies will be reveiwed by a committee including the police
chief, the president of the police union, town officials and a
resident. If the results warrant, the review committee may
recommend changes to the department.
   The 28 people who have returned surveys gave the department high
marks.
   None of the surveys returned so far are from the three
individuals arrested by the department, who are being held at the
Adult Correctional Institutions.

<TEXT>
   The nation's capital set a grisly standard
Monday when police recorded the 288th homicide of 1988, a city
record for the most homicides in a single year.
   The 288 deaths exceeded the previous mark of 287 homicides set
in 1969. Authorities blamed the upsurge in violence on drugs.
   The latest victim was identified only as a Hispanic male who
died at about 6 a.m. at Washington Hospital Center, according to
Shannon Cockett, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police
Department.
   It was not known how the man got to the hospital. Homicide
detectives believed he may have been stabbed about 8 p.m. Sunday.
No motive had been established.
   Police Chief Maurice T. Turner has blamed the high number of
slayings on violent turf battles between drug dealers. Sixty
percent of the year's homicides have been drug-related, Turner
said, compared with 33 percent as recently as 1986.
   In the past couple of years, Jamaican drug gangs have
infiltrated the Washington metropolitan area, local and federal
authorities say. Turner said the turf battles have been exacerbated
by the introduction of new drugs into the city.
   ``This is one of the last major cities in this country to have
an infusion of crack,'' a highly addictive cocaine derivative,
Turner said. ``When crack arrived in other cities, like New York,
murder rates went up there too.''
   Most recently, a drug combining marijuana, PCP and cocaine has
hit the streets, fueling the wars.
   ``It's called `beaming,' short for `Beam me up, Scotty,''' Ms.
Cockett said, referring to an expression from the old ``Star Trek''
television series.
   Turner over the weekend said officers still are not armed with
9mm semiautomatic weapons to combat heavily armed drug dealers,
despite a promise he made eight months ago, because no money in the
city's fiscal 1988 budget was earmarked for the weapons.
   But Turner promised officers would be equipped with more
sophisticated weapons within two years.
   Gary Hankins, chairman of the labor committee of the Fraternal
Order of Police, blasted the department for failing to protect
officers.
   ``It's ridiculous that it has taken the police department this
long to develop specifications for a weapon that everyone agreed
was urgently needed,'' he said.
   ``It's a miracle that one of us hasn't already died because he's
outgunned,'' Hankins said.
   The 9mm semiautomatic weapons fire more rapidly than the .38
caliber revolvers officers currently carry, and allow them to fire
an additional 10 bullets before reloading.
   The District of Columbia's police force has been cut to 3,800,
down from 5,100 in 1977, but Turner said more officers wouldn't
necessarily be able to stem the drug trafficking and cut the rate
of killing.
   He said putting more officers on the streets might produce more
arrests, but the city's overflowing prison system has no room to
house additional inmates.

<HEAD>Soviets and Chinese Reach Some Agreement On Border Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union and China have settled most of
their differences over the disputed eastern section of the
Sino-Soviet border, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Monday.
   At the conclusion of border negotiations that began Oct. 20,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze met with the chief
Chinese negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Tian Zeng Pei, said
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov.
   He said talks would continue on remaining areas of dispute along
the eastern border and that the two sides agreed to form a joint
working group on their differences over the western frontier.
   The Sino-Soviet border east of Mongolia is about 1,500 miles
long, while the western section stretches about 1,100 miles.
   The Soviet Union provided large amounts of aid to China after
the victory of the Chinese communists in 1949.
   But relations between the two communist powers deteriorated
sharply in the late 1950s as they vied for dominance in the world
communist movement. Soviet and Chinese soldiers traded gunfire
across the border in 1969.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has tried to ease tension
with the Chinese since he took power in 1985.
   China's leaders have made improved relations contingent on the
removal of Soviet soldiers from Afghanistan, settlement of the
Cambodia conflict and reduction of tension along the border.
   Soviet soldiers are withdrawing from Afghanistan and Vietnam has
said it will withdraw its troops from Cambodia.
   On Oct. 6, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev said a
summit between the Soviet Union and China was planned next year.
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Quichen is to visit Moscow before the
end of this year.
   Gerasimov said Shevardnadze's talks with Tian focused on Qian's
forthcoming visit.

   An earthquake centered in the
Mediterranean Sea shook the capital and several provincial towns
Monday, injuring at least 27 people, officials said.
   The earthquake, which struck about 11:14 a.m. and registered 5.4
on the Richter scale, was centered about 30 miles offshore,
according to Algeria's Center for Research in Astronomy,
Astrophysics and Geophysics. It lasted for about 10 seconds.
   The Interior Ministry said the quake caused no deaths, but that
preliminary reports indicated 27 people had been injured.
   Among those injured were 10 children in the town of El Affroun,
in the Blida region 30 miles outside Algiers. Officials said the
children were hurt when the roof of their school fell in.
   Several construction workers also were reported injured when
several buildings under construction cracked or caved in, according
to the official Algerian news agency, Algerie Presse Service.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   Sixth-graders in the Jackson School
District will have a new kind of homework assignment this spring:
Earn money to give to someone else.
   The Best Program was created last year for 116 sixth-graders at
Raines Elementary School, where administrators feared students from
deprived neighborhoods would be easy recruits for gangs and drug
dealers.
   ``We had a troubled group of sixth-graders last year. They had
low self-esteem, no self-motivation, homework was just brought in
in a sloppy manner,'' Raines Principal Rosalind Hambrick said. ``I
knew that we had to try to do something for these children before
they got away from us.''
   ``So we were looking for a counselor, a mentor, somebody,
anything. We knew that Frank Melton (general manager) at WLBT-TV
studios had done extensive work with gangs and troubled youth, so
we called the studio and his secretary said we ought to talk with
Dr. Yazdani.''
   Nanolla Yazdani, a psychologist, was working with Melton on
developing anti-gang programs for the city. Yazdani had gained
international publicity after developing a program for first-time,
non-violent offenders at the Misssissippi State Penitentiary at
Parchman. The prison program, which he no longer oversees, was
patterned after Army bootcamp _ right down to the spit-polished
boots worn by the inmates and their rigorous regimen of
calisthenics.
   Yazdani visited Raines Elementary and designed a program for
sixth-graders. This summer, he trained teachers from 10 Jackson
elementary schools on his program's techniques.
   This spring, educators plan to expand the program to all sixth
grades in the system, 2,562 pupils. Youngsters must have parents'
permission to take part.
   Meanwhile, some teachers are already putting Yazdani's
techniques to work, like Sadie George, who oversees an after-school
day-care program for pupils of all ages. Her students don't march
like Yazdani's prison recruits, but they do sound out some strong
cadences.
   Standing tall, heads erect and hands behind their backs, the
youngsters repeat their rhythmic Best Program creed:
   ``I am somebody; I will never use drugs.
   ``I am somebody; what my mind can conceive
   ``And my heart can believe, I will achieve.
   ``I am somebody; I will make you proud of me.
   ``I am somebody; I will do my work
   ``And I will love my fellow man, I am somebody.''
   The Best Program's definition of being somebody includes the
ability and willingness to do things for somebody else. Last year,
the Raines sixth-graders held car washes, then used the earnings to
take pizzas to deaf students at nearby Magnolia Speech School.
   The school's four sixth-grade classes worked as groups on their
fund-raising, but individuals are encouraged to daily share their
knowledge with others. Part of their homework is living the Best
Program motto: ``Each one, teach one.''
   Each child is helped to identify knowledge and skills he can
share, Hambrick said.
   To do their best, the children are taught to stick with a task
until it's completed, take criticism and think creatively.
   Hambrick said she saw children disinterested in school become
model students after Yazdani's 20-session program last year.
   Last spring, sixth-graders scored an average of 6.5 in
mathematics on the California Achievement Test, compared to 5.8
among sixth-graders at Raines the year before. In study skills,
scores went from 5.8 in the spring of 1987 to 6.8 this spring, the
principal said. A score of 6 is indicative of expected sixth-grade
work.
   ``Somebody asked me, `How is it that when they have to go back
into the school room and they have to learn 10 spelling words, why
do they learn those 10 spelling words now?'
   ``I think it is because they have learned the value of learning
the 10 spelling words. It's not because somebody tells them they
have to learn the 10 spelling words,'' Hambrick said. ``They've set
their own goals for themselves.''

   Actor John Houseman, who gained wide fame
late in life for his Oscar-winning role as a law professor in the
movie ``The Paper Chase'' after a long career as a theater and film
producer, has died, a friend said today. He was 86.
   Houseman died during the night at his home, said Ivan Goff, a
family friend and Hollywood scriptwriter. He died of spinal cancer.
   The Romanian-born Houseman became a household name while in his
70s as Professor Charles W. Kingsfield in ``The Paper Chase,'' a
role he first played in the 1973 film and then in the television
series.
   He parlayed that fame and his distinctive speaking style into a
lucrative series of commercial endorsements, including ads for the
investment firm Smith, Barney in which he bellowed, ``They make
money the old-fashioned way _ they EARRNNN it.''
   But before that, he was best known as a producer, director and
writer for both the stage and film.
   During a tribute to him in 1987 in Los Angeles, Houseman said:
``The only important thing when you've lived as long as I have is
what you've accomplished _ a body of work. ... We all tend to talk
about our successes. At least as important are our failures.''
   He first earned wide recognition in 1934 as the director of a
Broadway production of the Gertrude Stein-Virgil Thomson opera
``Four Saints in Three Acts.''
   In 1937, after two years in the government-funded Federal
Theatre Project, he helped Orson Welles form the Mercury Theater in
New York, one of several repertory theater companies he helped form
over the years. Its first production was a modern-dress version of
``Julius Caesar.''
   He was also involved in writing and producing shows for the
Mercury Theater of the Air, the radio form of the troupe. He was a
co-producer of the troupe's epic 1938 ``War of the Worlds'' that
created a nationwide panic just 50 years ago Sunday with its
realistic portrayal of radio news coverage of a Martian landing.
   Houseman also had a key role in putting together Welles'
landmark 1941 film, ``Citizen Kane,'' including collaborating on
the script.
   During World War II, he spent 1{ years at the federal Office of
War Information as head of programming for overseas radio
operations. His office put out ``Voice of America'' broadcasts in
27 languages.
   Among his film production credits were ``The Bad and the
Beautiful,'' 1952, a Hollywood drama starring Kirk Douglas;
``Julius Caesar,'' 1953, with Marlon Brando, John Gielgud and James
Mason; and ``Lust for Life,'' 1956, the biography of artist Vincent
van Gogh that won a supporting actor Oscar for Anthony Quinn.
   In 1986, the John Houseman Theater Center in New York was named
for him. It is home to the Acting Company, a touring repertory
company he co-founded in 1972. Among its well-known alumni are
actress Patti LuPone of ``Evita.''
   Also in 1986, he was honored by the Congressional Arts Caucus
for ``outstanding achievement and dedication to the enrichment of
America's cultural legacy.''
   ``Your charm, eloquence and excellence are a delight to all of
us,'' Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., said at the time.
   In September, Houseman said that he had no plans to slow down
from a career that included involvement in scores of stage, screen
and broadcast productions. ``I have tapered off a little, but I
wouldn't know what to do with myself if I retired,'' he said three
days before his 86th birthday. ``I still have something to offer,
even though the roles these days are usually small.
   ``But I'm 85 years old. I am not going to be offered the role of
Romeo anymore, or Juliet, for that matter. Yet the limited range I
do play, I play well. My range is that of an old man, but what do
you expect from someone who started acting at the age of 70?''
   In addition to ``The Paper Chase,'' his movie acting credits
included roles in ``Seven Days in May,'' 1964; ``Three Days of the
Condor,'' 1975; ``Rollerball,'' 1975; and ``Wholly Moses,'' 1980.
He also appeared in a number of made-for-television movies and
miniseries, such as ``The Winds of War'' and ``Washington _ Behind
Closed Doors.''
   He was the author of a critically acclaimed series of memoirs,
including ``Run-Through'' and ``Front and Center.'' His career also
included a stint as an educator: He headed the drama department at
New York's famous Juilliard School from 1968 to 1976.
   Houseman was born Jacques Haussmann in Bucharest, Romania, on
Sept. 22, 1902. The son of a wealthy grain merchant, he was
educated largely in England.
   He came to the United States in 1924, working in the grain
business while translating plays as a hobby, until the economic
collapse of 1929 when he went into the theater full-time.

   President Reagan today denied statements by
hostage Terry Anderson on a videotape released by his kidnappers
that his administration interfered with the release of hostages or
bargained with terrorists.
   ``I don't think that was Terry speaking,'' Reagan said of the
tape. ``I think he had a script that was given to him.''
   When asked about the statement on the tape that the U.S.
government interfered when the hostages were about to be released,
Reagan said, ``That is absolutely not true, but let me point
something out. Terry Anderson in that terrible confinement at the
hands of those barbarians _ any information he has has to have come
from there; there is no contact with the outside world.''
   ``We have been doing everything we can for the release of the
hostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to let
them go,'' the president said.
   Reagan answered reporters' questions after signing legislation
clearing the way for U.S. entry into an international copyright
agreement.
   ``There has never been any interference, nor have we ever been
negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of a
kidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' he said.
   When asked whether he thought the kidnapers were trying to
influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, he said,
``You'd have to ask them; I can't fathom their minds.''
   The president disputed a statement on the tape that Vice
President George Bush was involved in negotiations with terrorists
in the Iran-Contra affair and a Middle East TWA hijacking.
   ``Nor was I, because we were never doing anything of that
kind,'' he said.
   When asked what he thought were the circumstances in which the
tape was made, Reagan replied, ``You have to remember, these men
are in the closest type of confinement. ...you have to recognize
that no hostage is taking something on himself; they're telling him
what to do.''
   About prospects for the release of Anderson and other Americans
held in Lebanon, the president said, ``I'm not going to give up
hope for any of our hostages that are held. That's just too
unthinkable.''
   But, he said, ``the one thing we cannot do is negotiate with the
kidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encourages
more kidnapping and more hsotage-taking.''
   Earlier, Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said
release of the videotape was ``a cynical attempt to use the
hostages to influence public opinion, and the only real answer is
for them to release the hostages immediately.''
   ``It's not clear what they are trying to achieve, but it's
obviously meant to influence the election'' eight days away, he
said.
   In the tape released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
kidnappers, Anderson said:
   ``I have been very close to being released several times over
the past three years, but each time it seems that the U.S.
government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I don't
understand this.''
   Fitzwater said that statement was ``simply not true.''
   Anderson also urged the administration to negotiate his release
and appealed to the new U.S. president to end the plight of the
hostages. The Reagan administration has said it won't negotiate
with terrorists.
   Anderson said he was ``not asking Reagan to deal with
terrorists, although Mr. (George) Bush did so in the Iran-Contra
affair and TWA hijacking.'' He did not elaborate.
   Fitzwater said that statement was ``totally incorrect, wrong.''
He declined to elaborate, saying he assumed the vice president
would speak for himself.
   Fitzwater said the tape ``has some political statements in it
that are cynical certainly and most unfortunate for the hostage
families and for all of us who care about their plight.''
   Asked whether he regarded Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, as cynical, Fitzwater said,
``I think the hostage-takers are, the kidnapers; I don't think
Terry had much choice.''
   Fitzwater said the statements in the tape ``are outrageous; they
are cynical; they are an affront to the families of the hostages
and to the American people.''

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced plans to
sell Sears Tower, its corporate headquarters and the world's
tallest building, as part of an effort to streamline the company.
   Sears' restructing plan also will include a stock buyback,
``intense cost-cutting'' programs and the sale of its commercial
real estate subsidiary, the nation's largest retailer said.
   ``We are acutely aware of investors' desires for improved
returns and enhanced share value,'' Edward Brennan, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a statement. ``And over the past
year, we have thoroughly evaluated all strategic and financial
alternatives available to the company.
   ``These alternatives have been reviewed not only with regard to
shorter-term valuation objectives, but also giving consideration to
the longer-term needs of our customers and $526,000 employees, the
financial strength of our company and fulfillment of Sears'
long-term strategic potential,'' Brennan said.
   The Sears Tower, which rises 110 stories _ 1,450 feet _ from the
grid of the downtown Loop business district, was built in 1974.
   The statement did not indicate how much Sears hoped to get for
the landmark building.
   Brennan said it would continue to serve as corporate
headquarters for the company, although the 8,000-employee Sears
Merchandise Group would be moved to smaller, less costly facilities
over the next several years.
   The move would leave just 600 Sears workers in the building,
officials said. Counting employees of both Sears and other
companies, there are now about 13,000 people working at the tower.
   Sears said it anticipated $425 million in expenses related to
the sale of the building and other changes announced today, and
would deduct that amount from fourth-quarter earnings.
   However, the company said it expected to add $340 million in net
income for the year as a result of other accounting changes.
   The stock buyback program will be aimed at acquiring up to 40
million shares of Sears common stock, or approximately 10 percent
of the company's 380 million outstanding shares.
   The restructuring plan also calls for divestiture of the
commercial division of Sears' Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group,
redirection of its Allstate Business Insurance division and
strengthening of its financial services subsidiary, Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., with a greater commitment to consumer-driven
activities.
   The corporate moves to cut costs and redeploy assets ``will
enable Sears to compete more effectively and profitably in its
merchandising, insurance, financial services and real estate
businesses,'' Brennan said.
   At a news conference today, Brennan was asked what message the
restructuring plans were intended to send to Sears' huge number of
customers. ``The message is we are positioning Sears strategically
and financially for a period of unprecedented growth,'' he said.
   But Sears stock declined 87{ cents to $42.75 a share in New York
Stock Exchange trading today after the restructuring was announced.
   Speculation about a restructuring of Sears have been circulating
for months, as have reports that the company was seeking to sell
off several of its divisions.
   Last Tuesday, Sears reported its third-quarter net income fell
16 percent from the year-earlier period, marking the third
consecutive quarter of declining profits. It blamed the results on
flat merchandise sales and intense competition from other retailers.
   Net income for the quarter totaled $344.2 million, or 90 cents
per share, for the three months ending Sept. 30. That compared with
$409 million, or $1.08 a share, for third-quarter 1987.

   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem kidnappers
today released a videotape of American journalist Terry Anderson,
who read a message accusing the U.S. government of preventing his
release.
   Copies of the tape were delivered to two Western news agencies
in Beirut four days after Anderson, 41, spent a fourth birthday in
captivity. They were accompanied by a statement in Arabic from
Islamic Jihad, which holds Anderson.
   In Los Angeles, President Regan denied his administration
impeded the release of the hostages.
   ``I don't think that was Terry speaking,'' Reagan said of the
videotape. ``I think he had a script that was given to him.''
   He president added: ``We have been doing everything we can for
the release of the hostages, and the very simple answer is, for
those people, to let them go.''
   Reagan's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the kidnappers
were trying to influence the U.S. election.
   ``This is a cynical attempt to use the hostages to influence
public opinion and the only real answer is for them to release the
hostages immediately,'' Fitzwater said. ``It's not clear what they
are trying to achieve, but its's obviously meant to influence the
(U.S.) election.''
   Anderson began his message, which lasted two minutes and 35
seconds, by identifying himself and saying the date was Oct. 30.
   ``Once again I have been given the chance to speak to my
government, my family and my people,'' said the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press.
   ``I love you, I miss you very much. I know of your continued
strong efforts for me,'' he told friends and family.
   ``I have been very close to being released several times over
the past three years, but each time it seems that the U.S.
government uses its influence to stop any agreement and I don't
understand this.
   ``I am not asking Reagan to deal with terrorists, although Mr.
(George) Bush did so in the Iran-Contra affair and TWA hijacking.''
He did not elaborate.
   Bush, the Republican candidate for president, has not previously
been named as a negotiator in the 1985 jet hijacking, in which
Shiite Moslems demanding freedom for Shiite prisoners held 39
Americans for 17 days. Israel released 766 prisoners.
   Fitzwater said today that Anderson's statement about Bush was
``totally incorrect, wrong.''
   The vice president has said he was not a key player in the sale
of arms to Iran and was unaware of details and planning of it. The
deal became known as the Iran-Contra affair when it was revealed
that money for the arms was funneled to Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``Our problem could have been solved a long time ago without
such complications as arms deals,'' Anderson said.
   He urged the administration to negotiate his release and
appealed to the new U.S. president to end the plight of the
hostages. The Reagan administration has said it won't negotiate
with terrorists.
   It was the third videotaped message from Anderson since his
abduction in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985. The other tapes
were released Oct. 3, 1986, and Dec. 24, 1987.
   Anderson is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. There
are 14 captives, including nine Americans.
   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, said in an accompanying statement
that it provided the videotape ``on the occasion of Terry
Anderson's birthday and in response to your letters, and according
to his desire to send you a recorded message.''
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins,
Colo., acting dean of agriculture at American University in Beirut.
He was kidnapped June 10, 1985.
   The group is demanding, among other things, freedom for fellow
``holy warriors'' from all foreign jails and withdrawal of Israeli
forces from south Lebanon. It repeated those demands in a statement
Oct. 23.
   Anderson appeared relaxed as he read from the prepared
statement. He was cleanshaven and wore eyeglasses. His hair was cut
short and neatly combed. He was shown from the waist up, wearing a
striped gray sweater.
   ``I am well and being well treated and I received your birthday
greetings and as always I thank you very much,'' he said.
   Letters from family members and colleagues appeared in Beirut
newspapers last week, and state-run television broadcast a
one-minute film Thursday of Anderson's 3-year-old daughter, Sulome,
singing ``Happy Birthday.''
   Anderson said: ``As my fourth birthday in captivity passes and
the end of my fourth year in captivity approaches, I find it
difficult to keep my hope and courage high.
   ``The news I hear tells me that I have not been forgotten and
will not be, but the difficulty seems enormous.''
   ``I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts to
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks
to the Soviet Union for its help. It is a warming story,'' he said.
``That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to
bring this situation to an end.''
   To his family, he said: ``Peg, Madeleine and Dad, kiss my
daughters for me. Keep your spirits up and I will try to do the
same and one day soon, God willing, this will end.''
   The reference to ``Dad'' indicates Anderson does not know his
father died in 1986. ``Peg'' is Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, and
``Madeleine'' is Sulome's mother.
   Islamic Jihad has freed three Americans in the last three years
_ the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Martin
Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest, and David Jacobsen, former
directer of the American University Hospital in Beirut.
   Jacobsen's release Nov. 2, 1986, was connected to the shipment
of U.S. arms to Iran.

   The Procrastinators Club of America issued its top
award to the California gray whales that dallied so long off the
coast of Alaska after they became stuck in ice, a club official
said Monday.
   ``They exemplify the highest standard of procrastination,'' said
Joseph Weiss of North Bay Village, the club's secretary-treasurer.
``They waited until the last minute to go down to their spawning
grounds.''
   The Philadelphia-based club has not yet decided what the prize
will be or when and how it will be awarded, Weiss said.
   ``Their award will be sometime in the future _ we have to have a
lot of meetings first,'' he explained.
   The two whales, whose plight attracted attention worldwide, are
believed to have finally escaped their icy prison near Barrow last
week after two Soviet icebreakers cut a path for them to open water.

   A 19-foot-tall King Tut mask, 200 old-time
music machines and a 1597 map of the New World are testing college
administrators' ingenuity in finding uses for the sometimes odd
gifts of well-meaning alumni.
   The one-ton King Tut mask was donated to the University of
Mississippi two years ago by a Houston developer who was an Ole
Miss grad. The mask had hung in a building sold by the developer,
said university spokeswoman Barbara Lago.
   The school has put the disassembled bronze, copper and aluminum
mask in storage for possible use in the foyer of a new library now
under consideration, Lago said.
   ``We've had all kinds of gifts given to us,'' the school's
development director, Don Fruge, said. ``We even had somebody build
a 2 million gallon reservoir on our golf course to provide water
for irrigation.''
   The music machines, part of collection valued at $500,000, were
donated to Mississippi State University last year by a 1949
graduate who once played in the school's band.
   The music machines and other memorabilia dating to the Civil War
will be put on public display. More than 20,000 pieces of sheet
music also included in the collection will be used for research by
music students, school officials said.
   The 400-year-old map was donated to the University of Southern
Mississippi by James Riley, a retired Hattiesburg insurance
adjuster and his wife.
   ``The library has been the beneficiary of so many gifts from
them over the past 30 years, they've dubbed it the Riley
collection,'' assistant public relations director Phil Hearn said.
   Among the Rileys' gifts: old books and a 1962 mechanical pencil.
All have been put on display.
   Sandra Guest, a development assistant at Ole Miss, said the
gifts, referred to as in-kind donations because they do not involve
money, sometimes are extremely valuable. The King Tut mask, for
example, is worth about $100,000.
   ``It doesn't represent a significant portion of the school's
budget, however,'' Guest said. ``I really can't give a number
because we may get one really valuable gift every five years.''
   Some in-kind gifts, however, do generate income.
   Three acres of Palm Beach real estate was bequeathed to Ole Miss
in 1986 by an alumnus. A Bonanza steakhouse and a gas station sit
on the property and the school now receives rent from the two
businesses, Fruge said.
   Tougaloo College, a private school in central Mississippi,
receives a portion of the purse from an Ohio breeder every time a
horse of the same name wins. So far this year, the school has
gotten nearly $11,400.

<HEAD>Judge Wants Parents Of Hijacker To Testify</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief judge at the trial of
confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi said Monday the court
wants the defendant's parents to testify at the proceedings.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 14,
1985, hijacking of TWA flight 847, which was diverted to Beirut
after it left Athens for Rome. Thirty-nine people were held hostage
17 days, and U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was murdered.
   ``We still don't know when we'll be able to hear Hamadi's
parents,'' said Judge Heiner Mueckenberger. They are believed to be
living in the west Beirut neighborhood of Bourj el-Barajneh.
   The trial, which began July 5, has focused heavily on the Shiite
Moslem hijacker's childhood in war-torn Beirut. The parents'
testimony could help the court to determine Hamadi's age at the
time the hijacking began.
   Court records show Hamadi was born June 13, 1964, which would
make him 21 at the time of the hijacking. Hamadi has said he is at
least two years younger.
   On Monday, anthropologist Manfred Kunter, 48, told the court he
studied medical X-rays of Hamadi taken in Saarlouis, West Germany,
where the defendant lived from 1982 to 1984 before returning to
Beirut.
   The expert said he analyzed the development of Hamadi's elbow
and his collarbone.
   ``From the information I have studied, I would say the birth
year is 1965, plus or minus a half year,'' Kunter said.
   Depending on the court's decision on Hamadi's age, his maximum
prison sentence, if convicted, would range from 15 years to life in
prison.
   In other testimony Monday, psychiatrist Andreas Ploeger
testified hijack victims often suffer long-term psychological
disorders as a result of their ordeal.
   Ploeger told the court that one of the former victims of a 1977
hijacking of a West German airliner ``still imagines being followed
in a car'' by a hijacker.
   Hamadi, who was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987
after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage,
told the court he had no comments on Monday's testimony.
   The defendant told the court in earlier sessions he took part in
the hijacking, but he has denied killing Stethem.
   The diver's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, have attended
the trial regularly, taking notes and listening attentively to the
proceedings.
   Hamadi's attorneys last week asked the court to suspend hearing
more witnesses in the case until they can examine evidence compiled
by the FBI in the United States. The court has not yet ruled on the
request.
   Court officials said Monday that more former passengers on the
hijacked flight were expected to testify this week.
   Mueckenberger canceled Tuesday's session due to a death in the
family of one of the jurors.

<TEXT>
   The Yugoslav journalists' union has
sharply denounced political interference in the press and demanded
greater freedom, the official Tanjug news agency reported Monday.
   Journalists attending an annual conference in Belgrade last week
issued a statement saying the union ``is opposed to all pressures
exerted on journalists and editorial offices and rejects any form
of repression of the written word,'' according to Tanjug.
   The conference earlier had dropped from the union's statutes a
requirement for journalists to be ``committed to the principles of
Marxism-Leninism.''
   The phrase was replaced by a call for members to ``support
socialist self-management,'' the participation by workers in the
management of their own companies.
   ``The further democratization of our society will not be
possible without the ... independent participation of journalists
in keeping the public informed about the functioning of the
system,'' the journalists said.
   Although the Yugoslav media is far more independent than in any
other communist state, some journalists have been fired for failing
to support official policies.
   Several dozen reporters and editors, mostly in Yugoslavia's
largest republic of Serbia, have been removed from their jobs this
year for allegedly criticizing Communist Party bosses.
   The circulation of the Belgrade magazine NIN, once the country's
most authoritative political weekly, has plummeted since its
editor-in-chief and several journalists were purged earlier this
year for opposing Serbia's Communist Party chief, Slobodan
Milosevic.
   In July, a military court in the northern republic of Slovenia
convicted three journalists from the youth magazine Mladina of
disclosing military secrets and sentenced them to prison terms
ranging from five to 18 months.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service said Monday it
will prosecute 36 people in six states for trading in parrots
illegally smuggled into the country.
   U.S. attorneys in Indiana, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Texas
and California have agreed to seek indictments against people it
believes have been buying parrots from smugglers who sneak them
across the Mexican border near Brownsville, Texas, said Megan
Durham, spokeswoman for the service.
   Because indictments were still being sought, she declined to
identify the communities in which the defendants live. Two already
have been sentenced to prison, she said.
   Most of the defendants will be retail or wholesale dealers, she
said.
   Sellers of the birds, she said, ``chop down trees in Central and
South America to get baby birds, and many of these were smuggled
across the border as babies.''
   Some of the birds are protected by a treaty which outlaws
international trade in them without permission of both the
exporting and importing countries, or that outlaws trade in
officially listed endangered species.
   Violation carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and
a $250,000 fine.
   Following a two-year inquiry, investigators concluded that as
many as 26,000 birds a year may be imported illegally, the service
said.
   Investigators seized planes, vehicles and birds worth $468,000.
   These included the thick-billed parrot, an endangered species in
the United States and thus illegal to import; and the black palm
cockatoo and the scarlet macaw, illegal to import without permits
from the Fish and Wildlife Service and the exporting country.
   Also, the double yellow-head Amazon parrot and the Mexican
red-head parrot, which may not be imported without export permits
from Mexico. In addition, yellow-nape parrots and red-lored parrots
were seized because they were imported without undergoing
quarantine, Ms. Durham said.
   Parrots may carry Newcastle's disease, a highly contagious viral
disease that can infect poultry, the service said.
   The service has received complaints of the illegal trade for
some time, but has had trouble making cases because dealers claimed
their birds were bred in captivity in the United States, service
Director Frank Dunkle said in a statement.
   ``The illegal dealers commonly believed that once they got the
smuggled birds away from the border they would not be caught,''
Dunkle said. ``Operation Psittacine (from psittacus, Latin for
parrot) is the first major covert effort by the Fish and Wildlife
Service to target illegal parrot dealers operating away from the
borders.''

<TEXT>
   A hospital ignored state laws that encourage
``good Samaritan'' acts by firing a dormitory housemother who gave
shelter to a battered wife, a lawyer argued Monday.
   The former housemother, Sallyanne Brown, is seeking unspecified
damages and back pay from Northeastern Hospital in a civil lawsuit
that went to trial Monday in Common Pleas Court.
   Mrs. Brown testified that she was fired from her part-time job
as housemother at a dormitory for the hospital's female nursing
students after she opened the dormitory doors late one night to a
woman who was crying that she had been beaten by her husband and
needed the police.
   Hospital officials testified that Mrs. Brown was fired for
violating rules that prohibited her from doing anything that might
endanger the safety of the dormitory residents, including admitting
unauthorized visitors after curfew.
   Mrs. Brown's lawyer, Judith Chomsky, argued that the hospital
decision was based on an ``unreasonable'' fear that the woman posed
a danger and that the hospital failed to give housemothers
guidelines for handling emergencies.
   During the opening arguments, Common Pleas Judge Lawrence
Prattis said there was no question that state laws encourage giving
assistance to abuse victims, but said that does not provide an
excuse for violating rules established by employers.
   When Mrs. Brown was on the stand, Prattis asked her if she would
have let in a teen-age boy who came to the door with bruises and
said he was abused.
   Mrs. Brown said she would, to which Prattis replied, ``I believe
you would.''
   ``And that, Ms. Chomsky, is your problem,'' the judge said.
   Mrs. Brown also testified that a hospital security guard was
present Dec. 13, 1987, when she let the woman in, and that the
guard stayed until police came for the woman.
   Dr. Shirley Hickman, director of nursing education at the
hospital, said Mrs. Brown would have been disciplined regardless of
whether a guard was present.
   Ms. Hickman said the dormitory housemother has the
responsibility for controlling who comes into the building after
curfew, and that hospital rules prohibited the entrance of
unauthorized people.
   Ms. Hickman said she recommended that Mrs. Brown be fired
because of the rules violation and because she no longer trusted
Mrs. Brown's judgment.

   Amoco Oil Co. began its investigation
Monday into a refinery explosion and fire that killed two people
and badly burned two others, but did not expect to pinpoint a cause
for some time, spokesmen said.
   The injured workers remained hospitalized in critical condition
Monday with third-degree burns.
   Sunday's explosion and fire at the refinery was the third this
year at the complex south of Chicago in northwestern Indiana.
   Company spokeswoman Elise Sims refused discuss the investigation
or the possible cause of the accident. Results would not be
available ``for quite some time,'' she said.
   The company planned to interview workers, said Charles R. Mason,
another Amoco spokesman.
   Leo Gonzalez, 40, of East Chicago was hospitalized at Loyola
Medical Center in Maywood, Ill., with third-degree burns over 65
percent of his body. Robert Zivich, 44, of Dyer was at University
of Chicago Hospital with third-degree burns over 30 percent to 40
percent of his body.
   The explosion at the No. 3 oxydizer unit, which makes industrial
asphalt for paving and roofing, instantly killed Michael Zimmerman,
44, of Hammond, a 17-year veteran of the refinery.
   George Kusbel, 37, of Whiting, a shift supervisor with 14 years'
experience, died of burns six hours after the accident.
   There were no other injuries.
   Hospital emergency room workers had to cut through hardened
asphalt up to a half-inch thick on the victims' bodies.
   The accident tied the death toll from an explosion and fire in
1955 that also injured 35 people and destroyed 70 storage tanks and
200 homes.
   This year, on April 16, an explosion and small fire in a
processing unit injured 16 workers. Two men were hurt Oct. 6 in a
fire and explosion at a refinery unit where chemicals are added to
jet fuel.
   A December 1984 fire destroyed two bulk storage tanks and forced
the evacuation of about 100 people.

   Sir Laurence Olivier, celebrated as
Britain's greatest actor, has been admitted to a hospital and was
undergoing blood tests, his agent said Monday.
   The 81-year-old stage and screen actor was in ``comfortable and
stable'' condition at Royal Sussex County Hospital in the south
England resort of Brighton, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Olivier was undergoing tests as a follow-up to a kidney
operation last year and was expected to be back at his home near
Brighton ``in two or three days' time,'' said his agent, Laurence
Evans.
   Olivier's family had asked the hospital not to reveal any
details and ``we have got to respect the wishes of the family,''
the hospital spokeswoman said. He was admitted over the weekend,
she said.
   Olivier's has suffered cancer, pleurisy and a degenerative
muscle disease. He was quoted in a magazine interview last year as
saying he had fought off illnesses by ``sheer bloody-mindedness.''
   ``You need anger to see you through,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Genealogists Say Castle Site Could Have Been Camelot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruins of a castle owned by generations of a
Scottish Kennedy family could have been King Arthur's Camelot, a
genealogist said Monday.
   Greenan Castle, high on the Ayrshire cliffs of southwest
Scotland, was built on the site of a 6th century fort that
``matches almost exactly'' the description and location of a
fortress in Arthurian legend, said Harold Brooks-Baker.
   Although the story of King Arthur and his court at Camelot are
legend, historians believe there probably was a British ruler named
Arthur who fought Saxon invaders from what is now the Netherlands
and the north German coast. The shadowy figure was embellished by
storytellers into a chivalrous hero, slayer of monsters, leader of
the Knights of the Round Table and seeker of the Holy Grail.
   Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said
researchers had discovered the castle site was a key military post
for King Arthur and his knights.
   They made the discovery, he said, while carrying out research to
prove that the medieval Scottish barony of Greenan is an active
title of nobility.
   Norma L. Goodrich of Claremont, Calif., a specialist in
Arthuriana, carried out separate research into the fort's history
and believed it was one of Arthur's six castles and ``the most
important one from a military point of view,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   He quoted her as saying: ``It was the custom of the king to
refer to the castle he was using at the time as `Camelot.' ... In
my opinion, Greenan was one of King Arthur's forts.''
   The seventh marquess of Ailsa, Archibald David Kennedy, wants to
sell the barony, including the castle site, ``to somebody who will
allow the historical research to continue,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   The title of baron is tied to ownership of the land and not to a
blood lineage, he said, adding there was likely to be a blood tie
between the Scottish Kennedys and the Irish Kennedy family from
whom the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy was descended. JFK's
term often was referred to as ``Camelot.''
   ``We're trying to establish a blood relationship,'' Brooks-Baker
said.

<HEAD>Scientists Develop Way to Produce More Ethanol, Reduce Cost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biotechnologists have produced a
bacteria strain that could greatly increase the supply of ethanol,
a potential substitute motor fuel, and reduce its cost, the
University of Florida said Monday.
   ``For the first time, bacteria have been genetically engineered
so that they are now able to convert all types of sugars found in
plant material into ethanol,'' said Lonnie O. Ingram, professor of
microbiology and cell science at the university's Institute of Food
and Agricultural Sciences.
   Ethanol is the principal octane booster used in premium-grade
gasolines, replacing toxic lead additives, and is considered a
possible substitute motor fuel for the future.
   Ingram said he has changed the genes of a strain of bacteria to
produce ethanol from a wider variety of substances.
   Further development of this process could cut the cost of
ethanol production in half and eliminate dependence on cornstarch
or cane sugar as a biomass source for ethanol fuel, Ingram said.
   Corn starch now represents about 80 percent of the expense in
ethanol production. The new process would allow the conversion of
cheap biomass composed of diverse sugars into ethanol, Ingram said.
   ``It is now possible to convert inedible vegetable waste,
stalks, stems, leaves and woody materials into ethanol, a
clean-burning fuel which can be used to reduce air pollution and
our need for foreign oil,'' he said.
   Ingram and his team are not the only scientists working on the
ethanol problem. But researchers have always failed to design a
bacterium that can produce enough ethanol to make the process
profitable.
   ``If the Florida work is to be a major breakthrough, it will
have to be rapid production with high concentrations of ethanol,''
said Henry Bungay, an ethanol expert and professor of chemical
engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.
   Bungay defined high concentration as ``above 4{ percent.'' That
means at least 4{ percent of the mass digested by the bacteria
would have to be converted into ethanol.
   ``We can achieve 4{ percent without any trouble at all,'' Ingram
said.
   The development was made possible by cloning the genes for the
ethanol digestive tract from the bacterium Zymomonas mobilis and
inserting these into the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli).
   The research is to be presented at the British Society for
General Microbiology meeting in England in March 1989, the school
said.

   The theme in Halloween costumes this year
apparently is the bloodier the better, with horror movie characters
selling big at costume and toy stores.
   ``It's gross. It looks like razor blades for fingers,'' said
Marianne Chronowski, describing the hand that comes with the mask
in the Freddy Krueger costume, one of the biggest sellers at the
toy store this Halloween season.
   Freddy Kreuger was the murderous central character in the horror
hit ``Nightmare on Elm Street.'' Another popular costume was the
hockey-masked visage of Jason, the horrific teen-ager in the film,
``Friday the 13th,'' said Mrs. Chronowski, a toy shop employee in
Woburn.
   The same was reported at Jack's Joke Shop, a downtown Boston
store founded in 1922 that claims to be the oldest fun shop in the
country.
   ``There's also the traditional Draculas,'' said owner Harold
Bengin, who has been selling horrible get-ups at the family store
for 39 years.
   ``Many girls are going in for Elvira,'' he said, referring to
the vampy and vampire-like hostess of a TV horror film show.
   ``They're also going in for the traditional clowns, priests,
pirates and Arabs. Executioners are very big. We have a black robe
and hood and the big double-edged sword and vials of blood,''
Bengin said.
   In the spirit of the election season, couples are going as the
improbable presidential duo of George Bush and Michael Dukakis, he
said. ``We also sell them little American flags.''

   A family who found asbestos insulation
throughout their home can't sell the house, can't afford to
renovate it, and contractors refuse to tear it down, and their
insurance company won't pay a penny.
   The Selphs have abandoned their home of 14 years and along with
it, most of their asbestos-covered belongings, including toys,
furniture and their daughter's college diploma. Even the vacuum
cleaner had to be ditched.
   ``All my pictures _ everything I've had since my kids were
babies _ it's all in there, covered with asbestos,'' Carol Selph
said. ``I feel like we've been living in Pandora's Box.''
   It will cost more to have the cancer-causing asbestos removed
than the 40-year-old house is worth, and their insurance won't
cover anything, because it doesn't cover that kind of contamination.
   And the Selphs can't sell the home unless the asbestos is
removed.
   Contractors refuse to demolish the structure since workers would
need to take special precautions, and the hazardous materials can't
be disposed of in the county landfill.
   ``Some people ask when we'll be moving back in, but they don't
understand the immensity of the problem,'' Mrs. Selph said. ``The
people in the community have been so nice to us. Churches have had
fund-raisers and offerings for us. People have given us gifts,
furnishings and clothing.''
   Asbestos was commonly used for insulation until the dangers
became known, but it was rarely used in the construction of homes.
No other homes in Jasper have been found to contain asbestos.
   ``It's very unusual to find asbestos in the walls and ceilings
of homes, even homes built around that time,'' said Edward Palagyi,
asbestos coordinator for the state Department of Environmental
Regulation.
   When asbestos was used in homes, Palagyi said, it usually was to
wrap pipes.
   The Selph's troubles began in August when they had a heat pump
and ventilation outlets put in.
   ``I didn't know anything about it until two days after the
system was installed and I asked a worker if they could repair some
cracks,'' Mrs. Selph said. ``He said he couldn't and then told me
it was asbestos. I was floored.''
   To install the heat pump and vents, employees of Kinsey's Air
Conditioning had to cut through walls and the ceiling. That made
the asbestos friable, or flaking, and the new system wafted fine
asbestos dust throughout the house.
   Samples of the walls and ceiling were found to be 60 percent to
65 percent asbestos, and Selphs were urged to move out.
   ``We know it's in our lungs, no doubt about that,'' Mrs. Selph
said. ``But we've all had baseline chest X-rays, except my husband,
and everything looked fine.''
   The family now lives in a rented house a few miles outside of
town. They have hired an attorney in hopes of finding some way to
pay for the asbestos removal.

   Sen. Dan Quayle made use of a line that
was once used to belittle him, diputing Michael Dukakis' claim to a
venerable liberal tradition by declaring that ``Michael Dukakis is
no Jack Kennedy.''
   Recalling the line that Democratic vice presidential opponent
Lloyd Bentsen used to slap him down in debate, Quayle charged that
Dukakis misled voters by identifying himself with such liberals of
yesteryear as John F. Kennedy, Harry Truman and Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
   Quayle, seeking to solidify support in the Midwest for himself
and GOP standardbearer George Bush, said that the Massachusetts
governor has ``finally resolved his identity crisis.''
   Dukakis, campaigning in California's Central Valley, said Sunday
that ``we need a president in the traditon, yes, the liberal
tradition of Franklin Rooosevelt, Harry Truman and Jack Kennedy.''
   Quayle, commencing a weeklong series of appearances in the
Midwest and South, told reporters that Dukakis forgot to tell
voters ``he is a modern-day liberal'' like Jimmy Carter, Walter
Mondale and George McGovern.
   ``FDR liberals today are Republicans,'' the senator said, saying
that Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy were ``pro-defense'' and that
latter-day liberals have been relatively weak on national defense.
   During his debate with Bentsen earlier this month, Quayle said
he had served about the same amount of time in Congress before
seeking national office. Bentsen, in one of Campaign '88's
unforgetful putdowns, retorted: ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   Quayle traveled to Republican strongholds in western Michigan,
and then went to Ohio Monday at the start of a campaign tour that
will take him to Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, North Carolina,
Missouri, Oklahoma and his native Indiana by week's end.
   Peter Secchia, the Bush-Quayle chairman in Michigan, said the
state remained ``pretty close. ... It's tightening up.'' He said
the GOP ticket had a 9- to 11-point public opinion poll advantage
recently, but that this margin has narrowed.
   Quayle, standing next to jack-o'-lanterns and stacks of dried-up
corn stalks, dwelled Monday on Dukakis' newfound acknowledgment of
Democratic liberalism.
   But he complained that Dukakis ``wants to compare himself'' with
Kennedy, Truman and Roosevelt instead of Mondale, Carter and
McGovern.
   ``He's a liberal ... but he's certainly not in the liberal mode
of Truman, Jack Kennedy and FDR.''
   Quayle said that Rooosevelt had fought ``totalitarianism'' and
that Truman ``drew the line on the advancement of communism'' in
Korea. He said that Kennedy ``was able to stare down the Soviet
Union in our own hemisphere'' during the Cuban missile crisis.
   Kennedy campaigned in 1960 ``on a strong defense, he campaigned
on the missile gap,'' Quayle said.
   ``Mike Dukakis is no FDR, and for that matter, I didn't know
Harry Truman and I didn't serve with Harry Truman, but Michael
Dukakis is no Harry Truman, either,'' the senator said, adding:
   ``And, yes, I didn't know Jack Kennedy and I didn't serve with
Jack Kennedy, but Michael Dukakis is no Jack Kennedy,'' Quayle
said, his voice steadily rising.
   The crowd packed into an airport hanger, consisting mostly of
young people, broke into a ``Bye, Bye Mikie'' refrain, along the
lines of ``Bye, Bye Blackbird'' as Quayle beamed broadly.
   Appearing before several hundred people gathered at a
north-central Ohio ski resort later, the senator continued to chide
Dukakis about the Democratic Party's past personalities.
   ``How can the man who said our liberation of Grenada was a
`misuse of power' dare compare himself to the president who faced
down the Soviet Union in Cuba,'' he said. ``His idols should be
candidates like George McGovern, who in 1972 wanted to cut
America's defense by 30 percent.''
   ``If there were a law against impersonating America's heroes,
Michael Dukakis would be under house arrest,'' Quayle said.

<TEXT>
   An apparent robbery attempt fizzled when
a motel clerk assumed a gunman was merely decked out for Halloween
and refused to take him seriously, a sheriff's spokesman said
Monday.
   A man wearing an olive green ski mask and carrying a .410-gauge
shotgun walked into a Scottish Inn lobby in Knoxville on Sunday,
said Art Miller, Knox County Sheriff's spokesman.
   The clerk and another man had been talking, glanced at the
gunman, and continued their conversation.
   Finally one of the men asked the gunman if he was going to rob
the motel, and the masked man said he wanted money, said Sheriff's
Detective Carl Seider.
   The masked man then pumped a shell into the shotgun chamber,
Seider said. The man who had been talking to the clerk then
pretended to reach for a gun in his waistband, and the gunman fled.

<HEAD>Employers Should Prove They Don't Discriminate Sexually, Court
Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, examining ``macho''
attitudes in the workplace, was told Monday that employers should
be under a heavy burden to disprove sexual stereotyping when
charged with discriminating against women.
   James Heller, representing a woman denied a partnership at one
of the nation's leading accounting firms, said employers should be
forced to show by ``clear and convincing evidence'' they did not
practice bias.
   Otherwise, Heller said, it will be impossible to pierce ``the
impenetrable ... smog'' surrounding motives for hiring, firing and
promotion decisions made in the ``collegial'' atmosphere of
business boardrooms.
   But Kathryn Oberly, a lawyer for the accounting firm Price
Waterhouse, said there was no solid evidence to show that sexual
stereotypin caused the company not to grant a partnership to the
former employee, Ann Hopkins.
   ``We have overwhelming evidence of legitimate motives,'' Ms.
Oberly said.
   She said lower court rulings in favor of Ms. Hopkins were like a
football game in which one side wins without even crossing midfield.
   ``The plaintiff must bring the ball over the 50-yard line,'' Ms.
Oberly said.
   The justices, who heard 60 minutes of arguments in the case, are
expected to announce a ruling by July.
   Ms. Hopkins quit Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's ``big
eight'' accounting firms, after she was denied promotion to
partnership in 1983 _ a move that would have made her a part owner.
   She later became a consultant to the World Bank.
   Ms. Hopkins had joined Price Waterhouse in 1978 and was
nominated for partnership in 1982, the only woman among 88
candidates for partnership that year.
   She had been successful in getting business for the company,
winning government contracts worth between $34 million and $44
million.
   According to court documents, both her critics and supporters at
Price Waterhouse said she sometimes was overly aggressive, too
harsh, impatient with her staff and very demanding.
   One critic suggested she needed to take a ``course at charm
school.''
   A partner who supported her for promotion told her she would
stand a better chance of getting ahead if she would ``walk more
femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear
make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry,'' the documents
said.
   Ms. Oberly said Monday that the comment was made by Ms. Hopkins'
strongest supporter at Price Waterhouse. It was ``his personal
reaction. He was not the decision-maker'' on her promotion, she
said.
   There is ``no linkage between those comments and the (alleged)
discrimination,'' Ms. Oberly said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall asked whether there ``is any statement
in the record'' rebutting the charge that she would do better by
being ``less macho.''
   Ms. Oberly said that was not the point of her argument.
   ``That's my point,'' Marshall said.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, back on the bench after breast
cancer surgery 10 days ago, also took an active part in questioning
the lawyers.
   She asked whether ``maybe the burden (of proof) shifts at some
time to the employer'' to disprove sexual stereotyping charges.
   Ms. Hopkins sued Price Waterhouse on grounds it violated Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibiting on-the-job
discrimination. She said sexual stereotyping, unconscious or
otherwise, cost her a partnership.
   Professional partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a
1984 Supreme Court ruling.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled in 1987
that if there were mixed motives in denying Ms. Hopkins a
partnership Price Waterhouse was unable to prove that
``impermissible bias was not the determinative factor'' for the
decision.
   The appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what
remedies were due Ms. Hopkins and what the penalties should be
against the accounting firm.
   The case is Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins, 87-1167.

<HEAD>Cotton Farmers Must Double Acreage Cuts For 1989 Supports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cotton farmers will have to reduce their 1989
acreage 25 percent to qualify for federal price supports, double
this year's requirement of 12.5 percent, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng announced Monday.
   Unlike grain and soybeans, cotton suffered minimal damage from
this year's drought. Exports are down, and this year's harvest far
exceeds projected cotton use in 1988-89, according to Agriculture
Department analysts.
   Lyng said the established target price for upland cotton will be
73.4 cents per pound and that the price support loan level will be
50 cents per pound for the base quality of upland cotton.
   There will be no paid ``land-diversion'' for idling land under
the 1989 program, he said.

<TEXT>
   When members of the Acting Company heard of John
Houseman's death, they were doing what they do for much of the year
_ acting on the road.
   The touring repertory company, founded by Houseman and Margot
Harley, was in Missouri, appearing in the 1940s comedy ``Boy Meets
Girl'' at the Repertory Theater of St. Louis.
   The troupe of actors, currently 10 men and five women, was a
special joy for Houseman, the author, director, actor and producer
who died Monday at the age of 86.
   It was an idea born during Houseman's leadership at the Drama
Division of the Juilliard School in New York, a job he held for
eight years.
   ``The idea of creating of a company out of a school really isn't
a unique one,'' Harley said Monday. ``We hadn't planned to do it
but our first class was so astounding. They had created this
incredible ensemble as well as being individually talented.''
   The seed for the Acting Company blossomed in December 1971 when
fourth year students in the Drama Division presented a four-day
festival of theater. It was diverse program by the school's first
graduating class and included such work as ``The Lower Depths,''
``The School for Scandal,'' ``Women Beware Women'' and ``The Indian
Wants the Bronx.''
   The critics cheered, and Houseman decided to put into motion a
plan that had been percolating in the back of his mind for some
time _ a permanent, touring repertory company, made up of Juilliard
graduates.
   ``The Acting Compay fulfills a very important dual function,''
Houseman said in an interview with The Associated Press four years
ago. ``It provides pretty good performances of important plays and
does them all over the country, even in places that never get any
theater, except what we bring them.
   ``And it fulfills a secondary function, which, in a way, has
become equally important,'' he said. ``It's a training ground for
young star actors. The results are extraordinary.''
   Graduates of the Acting Company continue to make their mark in
the theater, movies and television. The first troupe included Patti
LuPone, Broadway's ``Evita'' and currently starring at Lincoln
Center in a revival of ``Anything Goes.'' Kevin Kline, the dashing
pirate king of ``The Pirates of Penzance'' and the looney con man
of the film ``A Film Called Wanda'' also was a member of the
initial company.
   Today, you can find other talented Acting Company alums
everywhere _ like Benjamin Hendrickson, a leading player on
television's ``As the World Turns''; Frances Conroy in the latest
Woody Allen film ``Another Woman'' and the new Lincoln Center
revival of ``Our Town''; David Ogden Stiers, also in the Allen
movie as well as a star at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, and
Lisa Banes on Broadway in Neil Simon's comedy ``Rumors.''

<HEAD>October Prices for Farm Products Up 13 Percent Over Year Earlier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products in October
held steady at their late-summer level but still averaged 13
percent more than they did a year ago, the Agriculture Department
said Monday.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its
preliminary report that higher prices for oranges, milk, lettuce
and corn were offset by lower prices for tomatoes, apples, eggs and
soybeans.
   Meanwhile, prices paid by farmers to meet expenses _ a figure
computed only every three months _ rose 1.2 percent from July and
averaged 5.5 percent more than a year ago.
   Farmers paid more for feeder cattle and calves than they did in
July, but feed and fuels were lower, the report said.
   Prices received by farmers for some major commodities are based
on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when
additional information is available.
   The revised figures showed the leveling off actually began in
September when the price index held steady at its August average.
The preliminary reading for October continued at the
August-September level.
   Prices of raw farm commodities began rising in May as the
drought worsened and continued climbing in June, July and August,
an increase of about 11 percent from last April.
   After holding steady during most of last winter, the USDA index
rose 3.1 percent from April to May, followed by June, 2.2 percent;
July 2.9 percent; and August 2.1 percent.
   The drought and searing heat during the spring and summer cut
1988 harvest prospects sharply and triggered the midyear price
rise. Total U.S. grain production is expected to be down 31 percent
from last year's harvest.
   Despite the leveling of the overall price index, some
commodities continued higher in October. Wheat, for example, rose
an additional 14 cents per bushel to a U.S. farm price average of
$3.89 per bushel, the most since it was $3.95 in May 1981.
   Prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were
unchanged from September, although dairy products gained 3.1
percent during the month and the index for poultry and eggs
declined 5 percent. Compared with October 1987, the index was up
4.1 percent.
   The department's all-crops price index for October, although
unchanged from September, was up 27 percent from a year earlier.
Prices of feed grain and hay as a group rose 1.5 percent from
September and averaged 62 percent more than in October 1987.
   Prices of commercial vegetables were down 5 percent from
September but were still 8.2 percent more than a year ago.
   Although the projections are subject to change, USDA economists
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $55
billion to $60 billion this year, compared with the record level of
$57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts
and cash expenses during the calendar year.
   Department economists are holding to an earlier prediction that
consumer food prices will rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year,
compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the
drought took hold, USDA was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2
percent to 4 percent.
   Some USDA officials also have predicted that the drought may add
2 percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected
increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That
could mean a 1989 food price increase in the range of 6 percent to
7 percent.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $67.90 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $67.20 in September and $62.90 reported for
October 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as
beef.
   _Hogs averaged $39.40 per 100 pounds, compared with $40.70 in
September and $48.90 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.71 a bushel, was up from $2.60 in September and the
average of $1.55 per bushel a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.89 per bushel, compared with $3.75 in September and
$2.62 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.15 per 100 pounds, compared with $6.82 in
September and $5.88 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.71 per bushel, compared with $7.94 in
September and $5.04 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 50 cents per pound, compared with
51.8 in September and 65.1 cents in October 1987.
   _Eggs were 58.7 cents per dozen, compared with 63.8 cents in
September and 50.2 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.40 in
September and $12.90 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 37.5 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
39.2 cents in September and 25.1 cents a year ago.

<HEAD>Los Angeles Best Real Estate Market, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite its traffic congestion, smog,
``ridiculously high housing prices'' and regulatory barriers, Los
Angeles rates as the best market for real estate investments, a
study said Monday. It listed Houston, Denver and Dallas among
``places to be avoided.''
   The pluses of Los Angeles and all of Southern California _
economic diversity, job growth, climate, quality of life and access
to the Pacific Rim _ outweigh its minuses, says the report.
   ``Indeed, growth restriction is one of the things that attracts
investors to California and to the other top-ranked areas,'' the
report says. ``Developers complain, often bitterly, of the hassles,
expense and risk, but they are increasingly resigned to them and
willing to accept the responsibilities in return for unsurpassed
development opportunities, less competition, and upside profits.''
   The study drops New York from its ``most bullish'' list but
retains Washington and Boston, saying that housing costs in those
cities are a barrier to continued high levels of commercial
construction.
   ``Fewer and fewer people can afford to live in or near those
centers, and that will take its toll on economic expansion,'' said
the report. ``New York is just too expensive and many firms can't
justify the rent.''
   Real Estate Research Corporation, which conducted the study,
said it sees New York ``as a premier market that will return to
favor as its inherent strengths prevail over herd instincts.''
   The ``to be avoided'' list includes Austin, San Antonio, New
Orleans and Tulsa.
   ``Any meaningful turnaround is still a year or so off in Dallas
and two to three years in Houston,'' the report said. ``Denver, a
much smaller market needs a year-or-two respite. When it does come
back, it won't be to the level of the early '80s.''
   The study was done for Equitable Real Estate Investment
Management, a property investment firm. It said there are fewer
``best'' markets than in the past and that ``no city or region
offers good prospects across the board.''
   Here is what the report said of other cities as real estate
investment opportunities:
   Phoenix: ``Overbuilt in every property type. Speculative
S&L-financed land deals, apartments and office space are in
seriously long supply. The Phoenix economy is slow and steady
(resort pizazz notwithstanding) and needs three years to rebuild
enough momentum to justify new starts.''
   Atlanta and Chicago: ``share the distinction of receiving about
as many positive votes as negatives.'' On the plus side: ``the
Japanese have discovered both cities.'' On the minus side: ``Huge
quantities of office space, hotel rooms, and retail GLA (gross
leasable areas) are in place, in the pipeline, and on the drawing
boards ... vacancies will increase in both Chicago and Atlanta.
Major problems can be headed off only by disciplined cutbacks in
new starts. Don't bet on that happening in either city.''

   The multibillion-dollar merger of Kraft Inc.
and Philip Morris Cos. Inc. could harm consumers, Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum said Monday in calling on the Federal Trade Commission
to launch an antitrust investigation.
   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called for the inquiry in a letter directed
to FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver, in which the senator said food
prices could go higher if the merger is allowed to go through.
   By creating the second largest food company in the world the
merger could seriously affect competition and sale of prepared
foods, said Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights.
   FTC spokesman Howard Shapiro said the agency would not comment
on whether it was looking into the merger.
   The proposed $13.1 billion buyout of Kraft by Philip Morris
would create the world's largest consumer products company.
   The planned merger, announced Sunday, would create a $40
billion-a-year company armed with some of America's best-known
consumer products, including Miller beer, Marlboro cigarettes,
Jell-O, Maxwell House coffee, Velveeta cheese, Parkay margarine,
Philadelphia cream cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Sealtest
ice cream.
   The FTC and the Justice Department share responsibility for
policing the antitrust laws. Investigations, which can lead to a
merger being blocked, are not made public.

<HEAD>Soviets Counter U.S. Claim on Embassy Construction With Own Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official said Monday that claims against
Washington for delays in erecting the Soviet Embassy exceed the $29
million America is demanding for an unfinished, allegedly bugged
U.S. Embassy building in Moscow.
   A Swedish official said Monday that the U.S. claim will go to an
arbitration board in Stockholm which has quietly dealt with
East-West disputes for 20 years.
   President Reagan said last Thursday he was recommending tearing
down the main office building of the new U.S. Embassy compound in
Moscow because the building was riddled with Soviet eavesdropping
devices.
   His administration is not permitting the Soviets to occupy their
new building in Washington while the status of the U.S. building
remains unsettled.
   Soviet officials deny the U.S. Embassy building in Moscow is
bugged, and on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov told a news conference: ``We also have bills to present
to the American side.''
   Gerasimov said claims for late delivery of construction
materials and equipment and for other troubles would surpass the
amount sought by Washington.
   In Stockholm, Ulf Franke, vice chairman of the Stockholm Chamber
of Commerce, said, ``We have been informed by the United States
that they are preparing an arbitration (case) here in Stockholm.
The next step is to appoint the arbitrators.''
   ``The case is well prepared and it might start any day.''
   His organization is the parent body of the Arbitration Institute.
   Franke said the U.S. government invoked a clause in the 1977
building contract for the embassy construction in Moscow, in which
either side can refer a dispute to the Stockholm institute. The
ruling of the panel is binding.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington
that the U.S. claim against the Soviets is for damage and defective
construction. No figure has been established for any bugging of the
building.
   The State Department has said the building will be torn down and
a new embassy will be contructed with U.S. workers and materials.
   Direct talks between the United States and Soviet Union have
failed to settle the dispute. U.S. officials said last week they
would ask outside arbiters to resolve it.
   Sweden's Arbitration Institute was founded 70 years ago and
began dealing with international cases in the 1960s. Its reputation
for secrecy has brought it a growing number of cases.
   The case will be heard by three arbitrators, one chosen by each
side and a chairman picked by the board from a list of leading
Swedish legal experts.

   Actor and director John Houseman, who died
Monday, was praised by colleagues as a gentleman whose wit and good
manners made him a delight to work with both in front of the
floodlights and behind.
   Houseman, 86, nurtured some of the nation's best-known actors as
a producer, director and teacher, from Orson Welles to Robin
Williams. But it was his turn to acting when he was in his 70s that
brought him widespread fame.
   His portrayal of the acerbic law professor in the movie and
television series ``The Paper Chase'' led to other appearances on
TV and in movies and commercials, most notably for the investment
firm of Smith, Barney.
   ``I absolutely loved John Houseman and working with him was a
great treat,'' said Ali MacGraw, who co-starred with him in the
1983 ABC miniseries ``The Winds of War.''
   Houseman starred as Dr. Aaron Jastrow, a Jewish scholar who felt
he was safe remaining in Europe at the start of World War II.
MacGraw played his niece, Natalie Jastrow Henry, who remains at his
side. In the sequel, ``War and Remembrance,'' which begins on ABC
Nov. 13, their roles are taken over by Sir John Gielgud and Jane
Seymour.
   Robert Mitchum, who plays Victor ``Pug'' Henry in both ``The
Winds of War'' and the sequel, said: ``He was a great gentleman and
I was very impressed with him. I'm very sorry he's gone.
   ``I told him once he gets all the roles I'd like to have and he
said, `And you get all the parts I'd like to have.'''
   Lindsay Wagner, who starred as Houseman's daughter in ``The
Paper Chase,'' said: ``He was charming, a total professional and a
joy to work with. But what I enjoyed the most was his tremendous
wit.''
   Kirk Douglas, who worked for producer Houseman as the star of
``Two Weeks in Another Town,'' said: ``He was a gentleman of the
old school, polite and courtly. He had wonderful manners. He was an
unusual character, and I'm going to miss him.''
   Lynn Roth, his partner and executive producer of ``The Paper
Chase'' for the Showtime cable network, said: ``He's probably the
greatest human being that I ever met in my lifetime or will ever
meet. He was a Renaissance man. ... He was superb at everything he
did, as a writer, director, producer, actor, teacher and a thinker.
They just don't make them like that any more.''
   As for his crusty roles, Roth said, ``When you told him he
wasn't a curmudgeon at all, he'd say, `Don't say that, you're
ruining my reputation.'''
   Margo Harley worked with Houseman for 20 years at The Acting
Company, a national touring group that seeks out classically
trained young actors.
   ``He was wonderfully supportive and great fun,'' she said. ``He
was somebody who has been responsible, probably, for more people's
careers in American theater than any single person, and we're going
to miss him very, very much.''
   As producing artistic director of the company, Houseman often
both directed and produced the company's plays. The group's most
recent production, ``Boy Meets Girl,'' which opened Oct. 14 in St.
Louis, is the first of the troupe's 62 that Houseman had been
unable to get deeply involved in, Ms. Harley said in a telephone
interview from the company's New York office.
   Houseman, stricken with cancer of the spine, hadn't been able to
work for some months, but had remained in good spirits and received
visitors until the end, including a group of former students about
10 days ago, Ms. Harley said.
   Ethel Winant, a close friend, said: ``John was never expected to
die. John hasn't (died) because he completed in his lifetime his
dream _ he established a national repertory company. His real
dream, his real care, was for his acting company. That's his
legacy. I think that's so remarkable.''
   She added: ``He worked right up until the end. He had a great
work ethic. He still had that incredible energy and wit and style.
At the end he was as gallant and as stylish as he was his whole
life.''

   Afghan Prime Minister Hassan Sharq will
visit the U.N. this week, and anti-communist rebels fighting
Afghanistan's Marxist government said Monday they would send
representatives to the world body.
   The General Assembly is expected to adopt a resolution welcoming
the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. It has adopted
resolutions annually denouncing the Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan in 1979 but no debate is set on this year's milder
document.
   Sharq is not a member of Afghanistan's governing Communist
Party, and the Soviet Union has indicated he could be a compromise
figure in a broad-based government.
   But diplomats at the U.N., speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Pakistan and the United States, which have supported the
rebels, find Sharq unacceptable because of his association with the
Afghan government headed by Najib.
   The Afghan Mission said Sharq would arrive Tuesday and meet with
U.N. officials. His schedule was not given but he is expected to
address the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations in a closed meeting,
although not the General Assembly.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of a seven-member guerrilla
alliance, announced in Islamabad, Pakistan, that the rebels would
send a delegation to the United Nations. He reiterated that the
rebels want to form an anti-Marxist government in Afghanistan.
   For the first time in nine years the General Assembly will adopt
a resolution on Afghanistan by consensus _ not a divisive vote _
after the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United States
agreed on the document, diplomats said. Previous resolutions
denounced the Soviet military intervention and demanded the troops
withdraw.
   Action on the Afghan resolution is expected to be taken Thursday.
   Sharq recently told reporters in Kabul, the Afghan capital, that
both the governing party and rebels lack the trust of the people.
   The Soviet Union repeatedly has accused Pakistan of violating
the U.N.-mediated Afghanistan accords by continuing to arm and
train the rebels.
   The accords were signed last April 15 in Geneva by Afghanistan
and Pakistan with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors.
The rebels did not take part but were represented by Pakistan.
   The Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, and
at the time the accords were signed had more than 100,000 military
personnel there. The agreements provide for the complete withdrawal
of those troops by next Feb. 15. They also call for Pakistan not t
interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.
   On Monday the 15-member Security Council adopted a resolution
confirming the formation of a 50-member U.N. observer force in
Afghanistan and Pakistan to monitor the Soviet troop withdrawal and
check for violations.
   Afghanistan and the Soviets have said the force is too small and
that it has failed to investigate complaints charging Pakistan with
violations of the accords.

<HEAD>Once Again, House Incumbents Enjoying Huge Financial Advantages</HEAD>

   House incumbents have a nearly 6-to-1 edge
over their opponents in fund raising, including a twelvefold
advantage in garnering contributions from special interest groups,
a private study showed Monday.
   The study by Common Cause, the advocacy organization that is a
frequent critic of electoral activities, illustrates one of the
major reasons that there has been little turnover in the House in
recent elections.
   Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said the incumbents'
fund-raising edge is creating ``a challenger-proof House of
Representatives'' and added, ``The `people's body' established by
our founding fathers is starting to look like England's
life-tenured House of Lords.''
   Common Cause, compiling House candidates' campaign finance
reports from Jan. 1, 1987, through Sept. 30, 1988, found that
incumbents had raised $136.9 million to $25.3 million for
challengers during the period.
   That included a $62.4 million to $5.3 million margin in funds
contributed by PACs, the committees formed by companies, labor
unions and other special interest groups.
   Incumbents had not only outspent their opponents by $92 million
to $20.9 million, but they also had a dramatic $79.3 million to
$3.6 million advantage in cash on hand for the campaign's final
weeks.
   Of the 328 races in which a representative faces a major party
opponent on Election Day, incumbents had raised more money than
challengers in 323 cases; received more from PACs in 316 instances;
outspent their opponents in 315 contests and had more money left in
320 races.
   Democratic and Republican incumbents both enjoy mammoth
financial advantages over their challengers, although Democrats _
who control the House and thus have more political power _ have the
widest edge.
   On average, Democratic incumbents raised more money in PAC
contributions than GOP challengers by $166,783 to $4,724.
Republican House members accepted an average of $132,064 from PACs,
compared with $31,408 received from PACs by Democratic challengers.
   Of the 435 House seats, 408 incumbents are seeking re-election,
including 80 who face no general election opponent from a major
party.
   In 1986, 98 percent of the House members seeking new terms were
re-elected.
   Besides having an easier time raising money, incumbents often
represent congressional districts that were drawn to include large
numbers of party supporters and in which the lawmaker already has
name recognition. They also make use of the perks of their jobs,
including their staffs and their ability to introduce bills and
help constituents.
   The 10 House candidates who raised the most money through Sept.
30 are Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., $1,286,467; Rep. Joseph
Kennedy, D-Mass., $1.228,525; Rep. Joseph DioGuardi, R-N.Y.,
$1,222,688; Rep. Jim Moody, D-Wis., $1,146,656, and Tom Campbell,
GOP candidate in California's 12th District, $1,085,250.
   Also Gary K. Hart, Democratic challenger in California's 19th
District, $1,059,739; Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., Hart's
opponent, $941,819; Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J., $897,265; Rep. Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., $867,080; and Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa.,
$858,885.
   The 10 top spending House candidates are Dornan, $1,169,163;
Campbell, $1,020,663; Moody, $1,006,549; Lagomarsino, $964,325;
Hart, $896,407; Jerry Schenken, Republican candidate in Nebraska's
2nd District, $811,674; Christopher Cox, GOP candidate in the
California 40th District, $770,564; Kennedy, $761,652; Rep. Bob
McEwen, R-Ohio, $758,648; and DioGuardi, $751,083.

<HEAD>Britain Orders Two-year Ban on Killing Seals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced on Monday a two-year ban
on killing or catching common seals in all British territorial
waters, with the same protection for gray seals in England and
Wales.
   The order, which goes into effect Dec. 1, provides a maximum
fine of $1,740 for anyone convicted of killing, injuring or
capturing the seals.
   ``This reflects the high level of our concern about the
diminishing seal population,'' Douglas Hogg, a junior Home Office
minister, told the House of Commons.
   ``It demonstrates once again the determination of this
government to take decisive action to protect animals and in
particular to conserve the stocks of gray and common seals,'' he
said.
   Hogg said the Home Office issued the order under the
Conservation of Seals Act 1970 ``following the recent threat to the
British seal population by the canine-type distemper virus.''
   A mystery disease, believed by scientists to be similar to the
common cold or hoof and mouth disease, killed thousands of common
and gray seals in British and European waters earlier this summer.
   Lord Sanderson, minister of state for fisheries at the Scottish
Office, said the protection ordered for gray seals around England
and Wales was not extended to Scotland because the situation there
was ``less clear-cut.''
   ``At this stage, gray seals do not appear to be significantly
affected and in any event they are currently offered protection
until the end of the year under close-season restrictions,''
Sanderson said.
   Hunting and trapping of gray and common seals, the species most
common in British waters, has been legal but the season was closed
for common seals from June 1 to Aug. 31 and from Sept. 1 to Dec. 31
for gray seals.

<HEAD>Search Widens For Teen-age Suspect In Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The search for a teen-ager suspected of
slaying a college student whose body was found in her bathtub
spread through New England Monday as reported sightings flooded the
police station of this wary town.
   ``We've even had people call in sightings that turned out to be
farmers walking down dirt roads and of one little girl on a road,''
said Police Chief David McCarthy.
   Tensions had been running high for days in the town of 18,000,
especially since published accounts quoting sources as saying the
suspect had a fascination with a Halloween horror movie.
   A cinema agreed to suspend the showing of a new horror film,
``Halloween IV,'' and selectmen voted Friday to hold
trick-or-treating in broad daylight Sunday, a day early.
   McCarthy said he has sent out 1,000 photographs of Mark Branch
to other police forces in New England. Branch, 19, disappeared
shortly after the stabbing death of Greenfield Community College
student Sharon Gregory, 18. Her body was discovered in her tub on
Oct. 21 by her sister.
   ``This subject should be considered armed and dangerous,'' said
a state police bulletin, according to The Recorder of Greenfield.
``Info received ... indicates this subject may kill again.''
   The bulletin said Gregory was stabbed in the back and head with
a knife that McCarthy said has not been found. He said Gregory was
not sexually assaulted.
   The chief described Branch as ``a loner. He was a different type
of individual,'' adding: ``A lot of people didn't like the kid.''
   He stressed, however, that investigators have found no link
between Branch's alleged taste for horror films and the slaying.
   A state police investigator said sightings were reported as far
away as Enfield, Conn., 50 miles to the south of the western
Massachusetts town.
   Police have searched for Branch since his car was discovered
abandoned on a back road in nearby Buckland a day after Gregory's
body was found. Over the weekend, however, a manhunt in Buckland
was called off because 30 searchers and trained dogs turned up
nothing.
   ``I think it would be very reasonable to assume Branch has gone
from the area,'' McCarthy said. ``Twenty-five hours elapsed between
the time of the murder and the time we found his car.''
   Newspapers have reported that Branch was a fan of the ``Friday
the 13th'' movie series, in which a character named Jason committed
a Halloween night massacre. And they cited unnamed sources as
saying police found Jason costume paraphernalia in Branch's home,
including a hockey goalie mask and black boots.
   Police have refused to comment on their search and the search
warrant they used has been impounded.
   McCarthy said his detectives reviewed the ``Friday the 13th''
movies to try to find a connection with the slaying.
   Police have no evidence that Gregory's slayer may have acted as
Jason, ``no paraphernalia left at the scene of the crime, no notes,
nothing,'' McCarthy said. ``This was a brutal murder, but it had
nothing to do with any ritual involving Satanism, Jason, Friday the
13th.''
   McCarthy said he tripled the number of police cars on patrol for
Halloween, but expected no trouble.
   ``I spent four days trying to clear up the fear frenzy that has
run rampant in this town,'' he said. ``I think by now the town has
come off this fear thing.''

<HEAD>Polls Find Dukakis Rated Better on Crime but Hamstrung in Own
Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' counterattacks have improved
his rating as a crimefighter, but the Democratic presidential
nominee still suffers from unsteady support within his own party,
polls said Monday.
   Republican George Bush led by 11 points among likely voters in a
national survey by the Gallup Organization for the Times Mirror
Corp., 52-41 percent, and by seven points, 52-45 percent, in a poll
by Louis Harris and Associates.
   The Times Mirror poll was done in the first half of last week;
the Harris poll was more recent, conducted Friday through Sunday.
Its 52-45 result was a very slight narrowing from 53-44 in a Harris
poll conducted Oct. 14-17.
   Dukakis only recently began to counter Bush's charges that he
was weak on crime, and the Harris poll indicated some results:
Fifty-three percent rated Dukakis soft on crime, still high but
down from 63 percent in the earlier poll.
   Harris also indicated that Dukakis had scored slightly by
portraying Bush's campaign advertisements as unfair. Seventy-five
percent called Bush's ads too negative, while 68 percent said the
same of Dukakis' ads.
   The Times Mirror poll, meanwhile, found support for Dukakis
uneven within his own party, while Bush marshalled monolithic
backing from Republicans and siphoned away some Democrats.
   Gallup said the presidential race has been largely stable for
months, with Bush ahead at least since September. But its poll
found an underlying factor in his favor: His supporters were more
loyal than they had been previously.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, has suffered slow erosion in his popularity,
to a point now lower than other candidates in recent years, the
poll said. And he lost support in some Democratic groups even while
gaining it in others.
   Bush's lead was based upon overwhelming support from
Republicans, solid backing from Republican-leaning independents and
``substantial defections'' from some Democratic groups, according
to Gallup's analysis of the results.
   ``For Dukakis, on the other hand, his support is not as strong
among his own partisans; and he is receiving virtually no
defections from members of core Republican groups,'' the analysis
said.
   The survey did find some room for change. Swing voters, those
who were undecided or said they might change their minds, made up
27 percent of the likely voters. And only about half of each
candidates' supporters backed them strongly.
   The problem in analyzing the race was Bush's stable lead on one
hand versus the softness of both candidates' support on the other.
``If Dukakis and the Dukakis campaign can get their act together
and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies, they
can win it on the basis of the numbers,'' said Andrew Kohut,
Gallup's president. ``But that's a big if, given the course of the
campaign so far.''
   The Times Mirror poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly
sized groups whose members share general values. Its ``partisan
poor,'' for example, is a Democratic group; its ``enterprisers''
and ``moralists'' are Republican.
   Bush attracted 21 percent of the ``partisan poor,'' in the new
survey, significantly poaching in a Democratic stronghold. Dukakis,
by contrast, drew only 2 percent of the ``enterprisers'' and 3
percent of the ``moralists.''
   The last Times-Mirror poll, in September, identified
``disaffected'' voters, set apart by their suspicion of government,
as a swing group. After a nearly even division in May, they backed
Bush by 61-27 percent last month.
   In the new survey that preference held steady, and Bush's
supporters in the group grew more loyal to him: Fifty-one percent
said they were unlikely t switch to Dukakis, up from 36 percent
last month.
   ``In contrast, on the Democratic side, defections to George Bush
have doubled among `seculars' and significantly increased among the
`partisan poor,''' Gallup said. While Dukakis offset the losses
with gains in other Democratic groups, it said, the movement was
``indicative of the problems that the Dukakis campaign has had in
achieving enthusiastic support'' from some groups within his own
party.
   Additionally, among all registered voters, not just those likely
to vote, Dukakis was rated favorably by 48 percent, compared with
58 percent favorable for Bush. The poll analysis said Dukakis'
rating was ``significantly below'' those of most candidates in
recent presidential elections.
   The Times Mirror poll was conducted Oct. 23-26 among 2,006
registered voters, of whom 1,505 were considered likely to vote.
The error margin for the likely voter group was plus or minus three
points. The Harris poll was done among 1,250 likely voters and also
had a three-point margin of error.
   In a state poll Monday, ABC News put the race in California at
51 percent for Bush to 44 percent for Dukakis. That survey was done
Saturday and Sunday among 510 likely voters; while the spread was
within its margin of error of five points, other recent polls also
have found Bush slightly ahead there.
   In a separate poll in Missouri, Bush led Dukakis 53 percent to
39 percent among 397 likely voters. The poll was taken last Monday
through Thursday and had a margin of error of four points.

   They were all there in spirit at John's
Grill: Sam Spade, Nick Charles and the Continental Op _ private
eyes in a public place, watching from the shadows Monday as
would-be writers played trick-or-treat with the ghost of novelist
Dashiell Hammett.
   The assignment was to ham-up Hammett, San Francisco's
hard-boiled gumshoe-turned-mystery writer who gave us such
treasures as ``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``The Thin Man,'' and ``The
Big Knockover.''
   About 100 hopefuls entered this ``bad writing'' contest, sending
in send-ups from Vermont, Illinois, Washington, Florida and
elsewhere. They all ended up at John's, a swell chop house in a
not-so-swell part of town.
   Hammett used to lap it up at the bar, but he would have had a
hard time swallowing the entries read on Monday. They were
definitely not the stuff dreams are made of.
   ``Nick was the thinnest man Nora'd ever seen. Handcuffs slipped
from his wrists up over his head to encircle his waist. He'd gotten
out of a lot of tight spots that way....
   ```Tell me the truth,''' Nora said. `When you were on the floor
wrestling with Mimi, did you have anorexia?''
   Oddly enough, that kind of prose was good enough to tie Kevin
Killian for first with William Vlach. Both men are San Franciscans,
both have real jobs and both want to be novelists.
   Killian got the nod for making an obscure pun. When ``The Thin
Man'' was first published in 1934, one line was deleted by censors.
Nora really asked Nick if he had ``an erection'' when he wrestled
with Mimi.
   Killian said his first novel is coming out soon.
   Vlach, a psychiatrist by trade, described a violent scene where
Brigid slams Babe McDougall on the back of his big head with a
two-by-four, leaving ``his right eye dangling out of it's socket
like'' something that can't be described in a family newspaper.
Vlach went on nicely:
   ``She turned to me, the Continental Cop, and said with a tear
dribbling through her eye liner like Moses parting the Red Sea,
`You won't turn me in. I love you. You love me.'
   ``I counted the lies in those three sentences, multiplied by
three, then opened the door for her pal, little Joel Egypt ... When
the cops got there I turned them both in. Her because she said she
loved me. Him because he called me Donald Dick.''
   OK, so these guys aren't going to get Pulitzers. The grand prize
package in this public relations gimmick was a bottle of cheap gin,
a ham sandwich and a hard-boiled egg. Vlach and Killian each got
their own, so they don't have to share, but it didn't keep them
from feeling like losers.
   ``I'm pretty disappointed,'' Killian griped. ``All I got was a
bottle of cheap gin and a moldy old ham sandwich.'' He apparently
forgot about the egg, and the free publicity.
   Nobody can say the judging wasn't fair, although somebody
probably will. The three panelists were: Hal Lipset, a real-life
detective who's cracked open more cases in 42 years than Hammett
could on a lost weekend; Don Herron, who has conducted walking
tours through ``Hammett's San Francisco'' for the past 12 years;
and Joe Gores, who wrote the novel ``Hammett'' that inspired the
1982 film of the same name.

   Irate passengers briefly took over
three planes within a 24-hour period on Sunday and Monday to
protest flight cancellations due to bad weather and equipment, an
official of the nation's flag carrier said.
   Enrique Santos, Philippine Airlines vice president for public

the airport situation at the central city of Bacolod, about 300
miles southeast of Manila.
   Santos said several flights to Bacolod had been canceled or
delayed since October because some equipment there had broken down
and would give incoming flights ``poor navigational aid.''
   He said the first of the three incidents occurred Sunday in
Manila when a domestic flight bound for Bacolod was canceled
because of the weather.
   Upon being informed of the cancellation, about 109 passengers
led by an unidentified lawyer took over a plane scheduled to leave
for Davao in the south and demanded to be flown to Bacolod, he said.
   The protesting passengers left the plane after 20 minutes, when
PAL authorities assured their booking for another flight Monday.
   Monday's flight left Manila without incident but upon landing at
Bacolod, the passengers refused to leave the plane and demanded
that the airport's radio and runway lights be repaired immediately.
   The passengers left the plane an hour later after local
officials assured them of action on their request, Santos said.
   On a return flight to Manila, six passengers refused to leave
their plane for an hour to protest what they deemed ``an apparent
discrimination'' against Bacolod airport. They left after being
told eight other domestic flights were canceled due to bad weather,
Santos said.
   Santos said PAL officials had not decided whether to file
charges against the passengers.

   A Roman builder who was abducted 4{
months ago was released Monday night by kidnappers who earlier sent
a bloody piece of a human ear along with a demand for $2.5 million
ransom, authorities said.
   Giulio De Angelis, who suffers from a heart condition, was
released at about 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EST) Monday between Bolotana and
Illorai in the central part of this Italian island in the
Mediterranean. He was kidnapped June 12 from his villa on
Sardinia's exclusive Costa Smeralda.
   The Italian news agency AGI said De Angelis was taken to a
hospital in Alghero. It said he was weakened by his months of
imprisonment.
   Hospital officials and police refused to give any details on his
condition, however, and would not immediately say if the piece of
ear sent with the ransom note belonged to De Angelis, the agency
reported.
   Last August, authorities intercepted a package sent to De
Angelis' family which contained a 1{-inch piece of a human ear and
a note demanding, ``Four billion (lire, $2.5 million) or we'll
return him to you in little pieces.''
   ``Do it quickly, pay, they want to kill me,'' De Angelis wrote
in a note enclosed with the ear.
   AGI and ANSA, another Italian news agency, both quoted
unidentified sources as saying the family paid a ransom of $2.26
million for his release. They said the kidnappers originally
demanded $15.08 million.

<HEAD>Investors Nationwide Lost At Least $300 Million, Commission Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY GIBBS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oklahoma Securities Commission accused
a defunct brokerage firm Monday of using high-pressure, abusive
sales tactics to persuade thousands of people across the country to
invest in a scheme to turn sand into gold.
   The Securities Commission estimated losses from the scheme total
$300 million nationwide, and at least $4 million in Oklahoma.
   The commission is seeking to revoke the license of the Tulsa
firm of Fitzgerald, DeArman and Roberts and seven of its salesmen
and principals, said Susan Bryant, administrator of the Oklahoma
Department of Securities.
   The firm's offices have been closed since June, and liquidation
proceedings are under way by the Securities Investor Protection
Corp., a federal agency that insures investor funds in the event of
the failure of a brokerage firm.
   The commission accuses the brokerage firm and the salesmen of
using high-pressure, abusive sales tactics to promote stock in
GoldCor, a Florida company that claimed to have a secret process
for turning black, volcanic beach sand in Costa Rica into gold.
   Even though GoldCor had no gold or other real assets, the price
of its stock rose on the over-the-counter market from 3 to 6 cents
per share when the scheme began in 1986 to about $11 per share
before tumbling last February. It is presently at 3 to 9 cents a
share, Ms. Bryant said.
   The precipitous drop followed a critical article in the business
magazine Barron's, and a financial statement that showed GoldCor
had no revenues, Ms. Bryant said.
   ``The real question is, does this company have any real value at
all,'' she said at a state Capitol news conference.
   She said the $300 million in estimated losses was based on the
peak price of GoldCor stock before it began dropping in Feburary.
   ``Probably thousands of people nationwide were touched by it in
some way,'' said Ms. Bryant.
   She said the Securities Exchange Commission in Florida has filed
a civil lawsuit against GoldCor, but said she wasn't aware of any
other action involving the company.
   Up to 14 firms besides Fitzgerald, DeArman and Roberts were
selling GoldCor stock at one time, but ``these were the people who
seemed to be pushing it above and beyond what they should have
been,'' Ms. Bryant said.
   Ms. Bryant said the firm's salesmen promised investors GoldCor
stock would double or triple in price, suggesting they had insider
information.
   At least two of the 65 Oklahoma investors identified so far were
retired people who cleaned out their retirement accounts to invest
in GoldCor stock, Ms. Bryant said.
   ``These were people who lost money who didn't have it to lose,''
she said.
   The commission said individual losses in Oklahoma from the
GoldCor scheme ranged from $1,000 to $450,000.
   In addition to revoking licenses, the commission wants to bar
the seven individuals from further associating with securities
firms in the state.
   The commission action Monday amounted to a 15-day notice of its
intent to take administrative action.
   ``We'll review the case to see if there should be a referral for
criminal prosecution,'' Ms. Bryant said, adding that it is a felony
under Oklahoma law to trade securities using false information.

<HEAD>Court Sentences Junta Members for Falklands War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civilian court stripped Gen.
Leopoldo Galtieri, the former military president, of his rank
Monday and sentenced him to 12 years in prison for mismanaging the
1982 Falklands war with Britain.
   In partial confirmation of an earlier ruling by the highest
military tribunal, the Federal Appeals Court gave the same sentence
to the other members of Galtieri's junta _ Adm. Jorge Isaac Anaya,
then navy commander, and Brig. Gen. Basilio Lami Dozo, who was
chief of the air force.
   The military tribunal's verdict automatically went for review to
the civilian appeals court, which can revise civilian or military
judicial rulings and even act as a court of first resort.
   Defense lawyers said the convictions probably will be appealed
to the Supreme Court.
   Judge Horacio Cattani, president of the four-member panel, said
all three officers were ``equally responsible'' for the ``mistakes,
omissions and negligence'' that led to defeat in the 74-day war
over the islands Argentina calls the Malvinas.
   Galtieri, Anaya and Lami Dozo constituted the third military
junta to rule after President Isabel Peron was deposed in March
1976.
   Appeals court judges acquitted three other officers who were
instrumental in carrying out the war _ Gens. Mario Benjamin
Menendez and Omar Parada, and Vice Adm. Juan Jose Lombardo, all now
retired.
   The case stems from the junta's decision to invade the South
Atlantic islands April 2, 1982, and the conduct of the war until
Menendez surrendered his troops on June 14 at Stanley, capital of
the Falklands.
   In May 1986, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces convicted
Galtieri, Anaya and Lami Dozo of negligence and incompetence,
sentencing them to 12, 14 and 8 years in jail respectively and
stripping them of rank. Menendez, Parada, Lombardo and seven other
officers were acquitted.
   Cattani, president of the appeals panel, said sentences for the
three junta members were made identical because doing otherwise
risked ``inciting the protagonists, in the case of a similar
conflict, to act independently ... losing sight of the fact that
... only a joint action would make possible a victory.''
   Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo alleged when the appeal began July
26 that the armed forces were ill-trained, poorly led, and acted
independently of each other.
   He focused on Anaya's decision to withdraw the navy from combat
after a British submarine sank the cruiser Belgrano in May 1982,
and the failure of Parada, who commanded army troops on the
islands, to establish a command post.
   Officers called by the prosecution testified Galtieri did not
believe Britain would fight to regain the islands or that the
United States would help the British.
   Galtieri, 62, claimed Argentina almost won the war and charges
of mismanagement were unfounded.
   In an emotional defense Oct. 17, he said, ``Would I do it again?
Given the same circumstances and conditions, would I proceed in the
same manner? The answer is yes. I, Lt. Gen. Galtieri would proceed
the same way as I did.''
   Argentina has claimed the islands since 1810, the year it
asserted independence from Spain. Britain has ruled them since 1833.
   The chilly, windswept archipelago is home to about 1,900
sheepherders and fishermen. Possession conveys rights to natural
resources, including abundant fishing fields and possible oil
deposits.

<TEXT>
   President Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico met
Cuban President Fidel Castro on Monday in the first of two sessions
scheduled for his three-day visit to the island nation, the Cuban
news agency Prensa Latina said.
   The government agency gave no details of the talks.
   Thousands of Cubans greeted de la Madrid at the airport Monday
and Havana's streets were decorated with welcoming banners, the
dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, reported.
   Before sitting down with Castro, de la Madrid placed flowers at
a monument honoring Jose Marti, the 19th-century Cuban poet,
essayist and revolutionary patriot.
   Mexico has been one of communist Cuba's staunchest allies in the
hemisphere. The visit will be de la Madrid's last official trip
abroad before turning over the government to Carlos Salinas de
Gortari on Dec. 1.
   Increasing trade between the two countries is expected to be one
of the main topics of de la Madrid's discussions with Castro.
   Mexico has had a favorable trade balance with Cuba since 1983,
Prensa Latina said.
   The Mexico City newspaper El Nacional on Sunday quoted de la
Madrid as saying in Punta del Este, Uruguay:
   ``We hope that the future brings Cuba closer to the other Latin
American countries and that a solution to the sharp differences
this nation has with the United States will be found within the
framework of dignity and respect for the Cuban people and within
the principles of international law that we Latin Americans
support.''
   His comments followed a summit meeting last week with six other
Latin American leaders.

   The Democrats are touting record-breaking fund
raising for the 1988 election with $50 million, but they still
haven't caught up to the traditionally richer Republican party.
   The Republican National Committee and its state-based ``Victory
'88'' program have raised some $92 million, finance director Phil
Smith said Monday.
   The Democratic National Committee announced it has surpassed its
fund-raising goal of $50 million at $50.3 million, the most the
national party has ever raised for an election. In 1984, the party
raised $24 million, said spokeswoman Julie Anbender.
   Both parties have engaged in an all-out effort to raise
so-called soft money, which consists of contributions that would
not be allowed in the federal election process but can be used by
the parties for generic and state-related election activity that
ends up indirectly benefiting the presidential candidates.
   For candidates seeking election to the presidency or Congress,
the law limits individual contributions to $1,000 and bars
corporate and union funds, all of which can be accepted by the
parties themselves.
   In the general election, no private contributions are permitted
for presidential candidates because they receive $46 million from
the taxpayer-supported public fund to wage their campaigns.
   In addition, each national party can spend $8.3 million on its
presidential nominee.
   The parties are collecting millions on top of that.
   Robert Farmer, head of the Democratic Party's Victory Fund '88,
said the party's $50 million had come from 325,000 donors, with an
average contribution of $154.
   However, the party also received contributions of $100,000 or
more from 142 individuals, said Anbender.
   Direct mail brought in some $300,000 a day, for $18 million of
the $50 million total, the party said in a news release, while more
than 75 large fund-raising events brought in another $18 million.
   On the Republican side, more than 125 contributors gave $100,000
or more as part of the ``Team 100'' program, said Smith.
   The Republicans' ``Victory '88'' program, in which money goes
directly to state-level party organizations, has surpassed its goal
of $25 million, raising $27 million so far, Smith said.
   GOP nominee George Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle,
have helped that fund substantially by appearing several times a
week at high-ticket fund-raising events out on the campaign trail.
   Smith said RNC mail in the past two weeks has produced more than
$300,000 a day, with an average $25 contribution. He called it ``a
boom'' the likes of which he has not seen since 1980.
   ``It's been very easy,'' to raise money since August, he said,
contending that people are reacting out of fear of what they
foresee as bad economic conditions should Democratic nominee
Michael Dukakis win the election.

   Investigation of a plane accident that left
actress Sally Field and her family doused with jet fuel was delayed
Monday as crews worked to free the jet's nose from the side of
another plane.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigator Greg Feith
said he spent the weekend at Pitkin County Airport examining the
jet, which aborted takeoff Saturday and crashed into two parked
airplanes.
   He said crucial electronic evidence was inside the jet's
cockpit, which remained embedded in another plane.
   Field, 41, had been en route to Burbank, Calif., when the
Canadair CL-600 Challenger began leaking fuel and apparently went
out of control. Also on board were her film producer husband, Alan
Greisman, 41, her 11-month-old son, Sam, and mother, Margaret
O'Mahoney, said Pitkin County sheriff's spokesman Steve Crockett.
   Field, her family and a flight attendant were shaken but unhurt,
while the pilot and co-pilot were treated for cuts and bruises,
Crockett said.
   Feith said he expected to finish his on-site investigation
Tuesday, and examination of evidence in the cockpit could take
several more days. He said he also would interview the flight crew
and passengers.
   Field, a two-time Oscar winner and star of the movie
``Punchline'' who owns a home overlooking Aspen, had borrowed use
of the private jet from producer and former talk-show host Merv
Griffin, according to Griffin's Los Angeles publicist, Warren Cowan.
   Griffin's jet had flown to Aspen to pick up Field after taking
Griffin and actress Eva Gabor to Griffin's Monterey, Calif., ranch
earlier Saturday, Cowan said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo ordered Monday that all
``problem'' place names that represent racial, ethnic or religious
epithets be eliminated from New York state maps.
   An executive order from Cuomo's office directed that all state
agencies refer potentially offensive geographical names to the
state Committee on Geographical Names. And he said derogatory names
should be eliminated from maps prepared for and by the state.
   ``Derogatory names have no place in the Empire State, and we
must act at the state level to ensure that such names are removed
forever from the maps New Yorkers use,'' Cuomo said.
   Cuomo took the action in response to the long-time use of
``Nigger Swamp'' on U.S. Geological Survey and New York state
Department of Environmental Conservation maps to a region of
Washington County along the shore of Lake Champlain.
   The region was so dubbed in the 1830s, according to legend,
after a black barge worker suffering from smallpox was put ashore
there to die.
   The use of that term by DEC officials, who said the area would
be stocked with pheasants, was news to Cuomo when reported last
month by the New York Post.
   ``Obviously, we didn't know about this,'' Cuomo told the
newspaper. ``And now that we do know we will do everything possible
to get rid of this ugly reminder of a time when people were less
intelligent than they are now.''
   His order does not affect mapmakers outside state government.
   The Committee on Geographical Names was created by the state
Board of Regents to establish ``correct'' place names in New York,
based on historical and etymological considerations.

   The vandalism of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' campaign

Dukakis national campaign spokesman said Monday.
   Dukakis spokesman Steven Akey said another incident involving a
campaign headquarters occurred in Tallahasee, Fla., when a big
Dukakis sign in front of the headquarters was torn down.
   In Vermont, vandals on Sunday broke into the building that
houses the Vermont presidential campaign offices of Dukakis, a
campaign representative said.
   Andre Oliver, the head of Dukakis' Vermont campaign, said that
while no attempts were made to break into the offices, 15 to 20
bumper stickers were plastered on walls in the hallways, saying
``Smart Democrats Vote Republican.'' Posters were also ripped off
the walls and cut in half.
   Akey also cited individual incidents of vandalism in the yards
of Dukakis supporters in Maine, Montana, California, Tennessee,
Arkansas and Texas.
   All the incidents have occurred within the last 10 days, Akey
said.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A U.S. congressional delegation met
Monday with officials of the military government to evaluate the
human rights situation and democratic reforms, linked to restoring
aid to Haiti.
   The six-member team arrived Sunday night for a five-day visit
that will include meetings with private citizens, organizations and
top members of the government of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril who assumed
the presidency in a Sept. 17 coup.
   Washington suspended $70 million in aid to Haiti after
indiscriminate killings by thugs forced the cancellation of
elections on Nov. 29, 1987. Soldiers did not try to stop the
killers who shot or hacked to death at least 34 people at polling
booths.
   ``We are here to listen,'' said Steven Horblit, legislative
director for Rep. Walter E. Fauntroy, D-Washington D.C. ``We will
base our recommendation on what the attitude of Congress should be
on our asssesment of the general situation of Haiti.''
   Fauntroy, president of the Congressional Task Force on Haiti,
has indicated he is in favor of renewing aid. Haiti is the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
   Horblit said the U.S. group hopes to meet with Avril but a
meeting has not been confirmed. He said the delegation would
discuss human rights, restoration of the 1987 constitution,
establishment of an independent electoral council and controls
against drug trafficking.
   Avril has pledged to set up an independent council to schedule
municipal and legislative elections. He said presidential elections
would take place only after local balloting and probably not before
2-2{ years.
   The military-dominated government of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy was
ousted and Avril installed in office by rebellious soldiers, who
demanded an end to state-sponsored violence and restoration of the
constituion suspended by Namphy in June.
   Namphy headed a junta that ruled Haiti after dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in February 1986 during
anti-government riots.

<TEXT>
   Residents of Reykjavik, who did not
allow dogs from 1924 until an experiment began four years ago, have
decided to do without them again.
   In a week-long referendum that attracted 12.8 percent of the
eligible voters, 60.2 percent voted against continuing the
experiment. The results were announced Sunday night.
   Mayor David Oddsson, a dog owner, said people who have permits
for dogs will be allowed to keep them until the animals die.
   Dogs were banished from this city of 88,000 people in 1924 after
an outbreak of dog-related diseases.
   A compromise in 1984 set rules for the keeping of dogs during a
four-year experimental period, while leaving the ban on the statute
books.
   Under those rules, Reykjavik's 850 registered dog-owners pay
yearly license fees equivalent to $120, each dog must have an
annual medical checkup and owners must carry insurance.
   No dogs are allowed in the city's central district. They must
stay out of public parks between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. and cannot enter
any public building, restaurant, playground, bus or barbershop.
Leashes are required at all times.
   Of the 68,570 eligible voters, 8,777 participated in the
referendum. The vote was 5,279 to ban dogs and 3,454 to continue
the 1984 program.

   Showers and thunderstorms Monday put a damper on
trick-or-treating youngsters in the South, while parts of Michigan
and eastern Wisconsin got a dusting of light snow.
   Fog, low clouds and drizzle extended from the southern Plains
southward to the Gulf Coast as warm, moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico flowed over cool air. Showers and thunderstorms developed in
southeastern and south-central Texas, with winds gusting to 54 mph
at Alice and 44 mph at Corpus Christi and McAllen.
   Farther east, showers were scattered from the eastern Gulf Coast
to the southern Atlantic states, but rainfall generally was less
than half an inch.
   Light snow mixed with light rain dampened central upper Michigan
and eastern Wisconsin, and roads in the Upper Peninsula were icy
because of snow.
   Out West, fog and low clouds draped the northern Pacific coast.
   Temperatures across the country Monday afternoon ranged from the
30s in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan,
in the 40s in New England, the Appalachians, the lower Great Lakes
region, northern Plains and northern Rockies and up into the 70s in
northern Florida, southern Texas and Southern California, and in
the 80s in southern Florida and the desert Southwest. Elsewhere it
was in the 50s and 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 29
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 95 degrees at Palm Springs and
Thermal, Calif. The overnight low Monday was 12 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   Rain was forecast Tuesday from the Atlantic coast westward to
the upper Ohio Valley, the lower Great Lakes and the Appalachians,
with thunderstorms expected in the South. Showers and thunderstorms
also will be scattered over Florida and southeastern Alabama. Snow
showers again were predicted for Upper Michigan, and rain was
expected across the Pacific Northwest and Northern California.
   Temperatures were expected in the 30s again in upper Michigan
and in the 40s and 50s from the Plains and the upper Mississippi
Valley across the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and the Appalachians
to the middle and northern Atlantic coast and in Washington state
and northern Idaho. Temperatures were forecast in the 60s and 70s
elsewhere, but in the 80s in southern Florida, southern Texas and
the southern Rockies and between 85 and 95 degrees in the desert
Southwest and inland valleys of Southern California.

   A woman who admitted plotting a toy
giveaway with some of the $7.1 million stolen from Wells Fargo in
1983 was sentenced Monday to five years in prison.
   Luz Berrios Berrios, 38, an occupational therapist from Puerto
Rico, received the maximum prison term, but was spared a $10,000
fine for her guilty plea in September to a charge of conspiracy to
transport stolen money.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie said a fine would be
pointless because ``this lady is indigent for all intents and
purposes.''
   Her attorney, Jacob Wieselman, asked that Berrios be sent to the
federal minimum security prison in Danbury, noting that she is just
a few weeks pregnant and needs to be near her family.
   But Clarie said that because Berrios is pregnant, the best
prison for her would be in Lexington, Ky. The judge, however, said
he would let Wieselman see if arrangements could be made at Danbury.
   On the day a jury was to be picked for her trial, Berrios
admitted to conspiring with others in Puerto Rico to send between
$5,000 and $12,000 to Hartford to pay for toys given away on Jan.
6, 1985, Three Kings Day, the day when people in many Latin
American countries traditionally exchange gifts.
   She said she presumed the money was from that stolen on Sept.
12, 1983, from the Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford in the second
largest cash heist in U.S. history.
   The government contends that Berrios is a leader of Los
Macheteros, a terrorist group seeking Puerto Rican independence.
The group has claimed a role in attacks on U.S. installations in
Puerto Rico.
   Berrios' husband, Juan E. Segarra Palmer, who prosecutors say is
a key defendant in the Wells Fargo robbery, and four other men are
now on trial before Clarie.
   Nine others are awaiting trial on charges in the robbery. One
other defendant has pleaded guilty.

<TEXT>
   Border troops killed 14 Venezuelan
fishermen at a weekend picnic, mistaking them for Colombian
guerrillas, the government said Monday.
   Two fishermen escaped the Saturday morning attack by diving into
the Arauca River and swimming a half-mile to a ranch near the
border town of El Amparo, sources there said.
   The Venezuelan-Colombian border incident, the bloodiest in
years, took place at Guafitas, 360 miles southwest of Caracas.
   Interior Minister Simon Alberto Consalvi said the victims were
``peaceful Venezuelan fishermen,'' not members of Colombia's
National Liberation Army as the Defense Ministry originally stated.
   ``President (Jaime) Lusinchi has ordered a wide, summary
investigation into the incident,'' Consalvi told The Associated
Press on Monday.
   Grimelda de Marquez, an El Amparo government official, said in a
telephone interview the fishermen ``carried no weapons at all. At
most some had just knives, as any ordinary fishermen do.
   ``They were going to have a chicken stew when soldiers started
to fire. They were all honest people.''
   She quoted the two survivors, Jose Hugueto Arias and Vollmer
Gregorio Pinilla, as saying the 14 bodies ``were bullet-riddled
beyond recognition.''
   Other sources in El Amparo, speaking on condition of anonymity,
quoted the two as calling the shooting _ a land attack supported
from the air _ a ``slaughter of defenseless, peaceful people who
were sailing toward the beach on a weekend picnic.''
   Gen. Humberto Camejo Arias, who commands the special border
security force, was quoted in press accounts immediately after the
killing as saying the group had been armed with light submachine
guns, explosives, and grenades, a list of possible kidnap targets,
and a map of Venezuelan oil installations in the area.
   He was quoted as saying the victims were allegedly members of
the National Liberation Army, a leftist Colombian guerrilla group.
   Pinilla and Arias were transfered under police custody on Monday
from El Amparo to police headquarters in neighboring San Cristobal,
400 miles west of Caracas, and will give testimony in San
Cristobal, the sources reported.
   Consalvi blamed the shooting on a ``lamentable confusion'' on
the part of the troops, who are responsible for guarding the river
border against incursions into Venezuela by Colombian guerrillas.
   ``This is the only explanation we have for now,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday, the Defense Ministry said 16 Colombians were
killed, but two bodies had yet to be found and 14 were still being
identified.
   A ministry spokesman said Monday the men were part of a group of
about 50 who were crossing the Arauca to enter Venezuela from
Colombia.
   Venezuela can pump up to 52,000 barrels per day of oil from the
area, and last year completed an oil pipeline from Guafitas to a
small refinery 90 miles north at San Silvestre.
   Venezuela increased its border security in February in response
to a rise in kidnappings of its citizens by alleged Colombian
guerrillas.

   Republican George Bush mocked Michael Dukakis
on Monday for claiming the liberal label that the Democratic
nominee had long avoided, and ridiculed Dukakis' invitation for a
third televised debate on election eve next week.
   Instead, Bush suggested that Dukakis debate himself, ``the New
Left vs. the Old Left.''
   ``Dukakis vs. Dukakis ... it should be an entertaining debate,''
the vice president said in rallies in St. Louis and Louisville, Ky.
   Bush said the Dukakis who now calls himself a liberal could
debate the earlier one who shunned the ``L word,'' which Bush and
President Reagan have used repeatedly to taunt the Massachusetts
governor.
   Faced with an apparent narrowing of his lead over Dukakis in
several major states, Bush appealed for the support of disenchanted
Democrats. He borrowed a phrase made popular by former President
Nixon in calling them ``the silent majority.''
   As the presidential campaign entered its final week, the GOP
nominee wasted no time in poking fun at his Democratic rival for
embracing liberalism Sunday during a campaign tour of California on
Sunday, and dismissed Dukakis' challenge to join him in an
hour-long debate the night before the Nov. 8 election.
   ``An election eve debate? Read my hand gesture. That says it,''
Bush told reporters accompanying him on Air Force Two in a
paraphrase of his ``read my lips: no new taxes'' line.
   The vice president held up one finger, then two, to indicate the
two previous presidential debates in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Los
Angeles in late September and mid-October.
   Speaking to a rally in the Commonwealth Civic Center in
Louisville, Bush asked his audience to ``remember how (Dukakis)
jumped all over me for using the L-word'' in their second debate.
   ``Well, yesterday, miracle of miracles. Headlines. Read all
about it. He's using the liberal label again,'' Bush said.
   Suggesting that Dukakis debate himself, the GOP nominee said:
   ``One could claim to be on the side of ordinary Americans and
the other could explain whether he thinks ordinary Americans oppose
the death penalty for drug kingpins like he does, favor weekend
furloughs for convicted murders ... oppose asking for a requirement
for teachers to lead the kids in the Pledge of Allegiance.''
   He repeated those lines at a subsequent rally in the remodeled
Union Station in St. Louis, adding that ``at the end, the moderator
should say, will the real governor of Massachusetts stand up.''
   Bush boarded a train for a five-minute ride into the cavernous,
open-air station, where he addressed several thousand people from a
platform he shared with an oversized pumpkin with ``Bush-Quayle
88'' carved in its side.
   ``We're in a horserace,'' Bush told the crowd. ``I won't settle
for anything less than a first-place finish.''
   In Louisville, Bush said he could now use the ``L word freely,''
and declared that ``we cannot let the naive disarmers and the
nuclear freezers back into the White House.''
   In his appeal to what he called ``abandoned'' Democrats, Bush
said the Democratic Party had moved away from mainstream America.
   ``So, my pitch here, in the last eight days, is to those good
Democrats, the rank and file,'' he said. ``I tell them: have hope,
have confidence.''
   Kentucky, where local polls show Bush enjoys a double-digit
lead, has nine electoral votes. Missouri, where polls show the race
to be much closer, has 11 electoral votes.
   At another pep rally in Kansas City, Mo., Bush said told the
crowd, ``we are involved in a tough race,'' and repeated his pledge
to campaign as if the Republican ticket were 10 points behind in
the polls.
   ``I don't care what these polls show,'' he said.
   The vice president planned to spend most of the week campaigning
in large Midwestern industrial states before heading for California.
   Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said the vice president
planned to spend much of his remaining time in Dukakis'
``must-win'' states.
   ``If you and your opponent are in his base states, then that's a
sign you've met your goals and he hasn't,'' Atwater said in an
interview.
   He said Bush running mate Dan Quayle would continue to campaign
``in our base states.''
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign distributed a 348-page compilation
of the vice president's campaign speeches bearing the title
``Leadership on the Issues,'' in an apparent effort to blunt
criticism of negative GOP campaign advertising attacking Dukakis.
   Bush stood by a stack of the books at the St. Louis rally and
said, ``This is what the campaign is about, not those TV ads.''
   At least one of the Bush speeches reprinted in the book had been
sanitized. The vice president's highly publicized misstatement
about Pearl Harbor Day occurring on Sept. 7 instead of Dec. 7
during a speech before the American Legion in Louisville does not
appear in the book's version of the speech.

<TEXT>
   Democratic underdog Michael Dukakis made
a populist pitch for the support of women and young voters Monday,
and said his boisterous reception ``smells like victory'' in the
Nov. 8 election.
   He won cheers from an audience at San Jose State College for
stands on abortion, the environment and economic opportunity, and
drew loud, approving boos when he lambasted Republican rival George
Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, on the same issues.
   But Dukakis refrained from using the word ``liberal'' until a
later appearance at Cerritos Community College in Los Angeles,
where he cloaked himself in the ``liberal tradition of great
presidents like Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John
Kennedy.''
   Dukakis started using the word Sunday in California, defiantly
proclaiming himself a liberal. Bush had repeatedly taunted Dukakis
with the ``L word'' during the fall campaign, saying the Democrat
has tried to hide his leftward leanings.
   Dukakis aides also released a text of a five-minute commercial
to be broadcast Tuesday night on NBC. In it Dukakis refers to
Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy as well as Lyndon Johnson.
   ``This election has always been an uphill fight,'' Dukakis says
in the ad. ``But about some things, I'm as stubborn as my critics
say, and I'm determined that in the intense days of this last week
we will continue to see the truth and to speak it.''
   He also criticizes the tone of the Republican campaign, saying,
``They are running for the highest office in the land by waging the
lowest-level campaign in modern history.''
   At the San Jose appearance, he invoked the names of those three
presidents as having provided ``a caring government and caring
political leadership.'' Said Dukakis: ``That's the kind of
president I want to be.''
   ``It's Halloween today, isn't it?'' the Democratic nominee
reminded his noisy campus audience in this environmentally
sensitive state with its bigger-than-any prize of 47 electoral
votes.
   ``Mr. Bush is going to be passing himself as an
environmentalist. No treat for us. That's the biggest trick in the
book,'' Dukakis said.
   He reaffirmed his opposition to oil drilling off the California
coast and said the Reagan-Bush administration had ``the worst
environmental record in the history of this country.''
   He went on the counterattack against Bush's criticism of
pollution in Boston Harbor.
   ``I'm not the guy who polluted Boston Harbor,'' Dukakis said.
``I'm the guy who's cleaning it up, no thanks to Mr. Bush and his
friends.''
   Making his first major appeal to women voters, a traditional
source of Democratic strength, Dukakis said the Republican ticket
had ``been on the wrong side of every issue of special importance
to American women.''
   He said that if voters believe in comparable wages for both
sexes, affordable child care and parental leave laws, ``then we're
on your side.'' Dukakis then dropped his voice when he spoke of
abortion.
   Dukakis shook his head when he said Quayle had told a
12-year-old girl last week that if she were raped by her father and
became pregnant, ``the government had a right to force her to bear
that child.''
   The overflow San Jose audience of several hundred people erupted
in loud boos.
   (Quayle made no mention of the government when he answered an
11-year-old girl's question in Illinois last week about his advice
in such a situation. Quayle responded that he favored childbirth
over abortion even under those circumstances.)
   Dukakis said his Republican opponent wanted to outlaw abortions.
``I believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman in the
exercise of her beliefs,'' Dukakis said.
   He turned to his student listeners and quoted Kennedy's words
during a 1960 campaign visit to California. ``You have to decide
which candidate reflects your judgment of our country, of its needs
and of its future,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis boasted that he was narrowing Bush's once-formidable
lead in the polls and said: ``There is a feeling in the air and it
smells like victory to me.''
   He challenged the vice president again to join him in an
hour-long, nationally broadcast debate on election eve next Monday
night.
   ``You can't inherit the White House,'' Dukakis said. ``You've
got to earn the right to be president of the United States.''
   Bush dismissed the invitation during a campaign appearance in
Louisville, Ky., mockingly suggesting that Dukakis debate himself
in a matchup of ``the New Left vs. the Old Left.''
   Dukakis headed for Los Angeles and Ohio, a Midwestern industrial
state where the Democratic nominee also hopes to overtake Bush by
election night.

   Judicial authorities on Monday forbid
Greek-American banker George Koskotas from leaving Greece while he
is under investigation following his indictment on charges of
forgery and embezzlement.
   Several newspapers have claimed that members of the governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, known as PASOK, have financial
links with Koskotas through his ownership of the Bank of Crete.
   The government promised full backing of the investigation.
Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said, ``We won't pardon
anyone, whether he belongs to PASOK or not.''
   Koskotas, 34, bought the Bank of Crete in 1984 and then built a
banking and publishing empire that controls three daily newspapers,
a radio station and the soccer team Olympiakos of Piraeus.
   He did not appear before the judicial council considering the
travel ban but issued a statement through his lawyer saying it was
unnecessary because he ``intends to remain in Greece at the
disposal of the authorities.''
   Koskotas was suspended earlier this month as chairman of the
Bank of Crete and was indicted on five counts of forgery and
embezzlement, mostly involving foreign exchange.
   The Bank of Greece, the country's central bank, has guaranteed
the equivalent of $80 million in private depositors' accounts at
the Bank of Crete.
   Koskotas also was sued Monday by Premier Andreas Papandreou's
36-year-old son, George, and two other senior officials in the
socialist government. They accused Koskotas of forgery and
defamation.
   George Papandreou, the education minister, said a document
purporting to show transfers totalling $5.3 million to the three
plaintiffs was a forgery.
   According to the document, a statement attributed to the
American brokerage firm Merrill Lynch & Co., transfers were made in
December 1987 of $2.3 million to George Papandreou, $500,000 to
National Economy Undersecretary George Petsos and $2.5 million to
Antonis Livanis, the premier's private secretary.
   George Papandreou showed reporters copies of the statement and a
letter from a New York lawyer's office saying Merrill Lynch & Co.
had no record of the transfers.
   The premier defended his son, saying ``the education minister
spoke the truth and the whole truth according to what we know.''
   Koskotas on Saturday resigned as chairman of his media group,
Grammi, saying he wanted to defend his ``personal honor in a way
that will not harm anyone at Grammi.''
   Haris Bousbourelis, a political editor, became chairman of the
group that publishes five magazines, three daily newspapers and
controls the SKY-100 radio station.
   Koskotas grew up in the United States, returned to Greece in
1979 and joined the Bank of Crete as an accountant.

   Police said a Syrian soldier and a
Lebanese policeman were wounded Monday in a gunfire attack on a
checkpoint manned by both police and troops.
   They said the raid by unidentified gunmen occurred near the
Hussein Bin Ali Vocational center in south Beirut's Bir el-Abed
district, which is controlled by the pro-Iranian fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Syrian troops were deployed in the Shiite slums last May to put
an end to a three-week bloodbath between Hezbollah and its
Syrian-backed archrival, Amal.
   In New York, U.N. officials announced Monday that
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ordered an envoy,
Jean-Caude Aime, to assess the situation in Lebanon and meet with
political leaders.
   Aime, a U.N. director for special political affairs, was already
in Lebanon to study developments and report back to the
secretary-general.
   The secretary-general's spokeswoman, Nadia Younes, told
reporters the United Nations has many activities in Lebanon,
ranging from peacekeeping to humanitarian aid. She declined to
elaborate on Aime's purpose or disclose his schedule of meetings.
   Lebanon has endured 13{ years of civil war.
   The United Nations maintains that the troubles in Lebanon are an
internal problem, with international repercussions, she said.

   A rally Monday on the Yale campus by a
group of students, alumni and faculty calling themselves ``Yalies

backers who swarmed around speakers who took turns attacking the
vice president.
   As students carrying Bush-Quayle signs worked their way to the
front of the crowd, supporters of Michael Dukakis responded in
kind, crowding closer and closer to the speakers until they were
completely surrounded.
   Yale police attempted in vain to get the competing camps to pull
back.
   About 200 people attended the rally, and the proximity of the
crowd to the speakers made it difficult to hear the speeches from
any distance.
   The Bush supporters occasionally heckled but did not prevent
members of ``Yalies Against Bush,'' or John Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential candidate's son, from delivering their speeches.
   When speakers finished their remarks and ``Yalies Against Bush''
responded with ``Go Duke'' and other chants, the Bush supporters,
some of whom remained at the back of the crowd, yelled ``Four more

<HEAD>Congressmen Warn Against Visit by Waldheim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress have told the president of
Turkey that a meeting with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim would
damage Turkish ties with the United States.
   At the same time, a Turkish official said his government asked
Waldheim to stop in Istanbul rather than in Ankara, the capital, so
as not to make his visit appear official.
   Waldheim had asked to stop in Ankara and see President Kenan
Evren on his way home from the Middle East, said the official, who
declined to be named. But Turkish authorities informed Waldheim
that Evren would not be in Ankara that day and asked the Austrian
to stop in Istanbul instead.
   ``That way it doesn't seem like an official visit,'' he said.
   In a telegram to President Evren, six members of the House
subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East said they were
``appalled and shocked at the news that Kurt Waldheim will be
received by you early in November.''
   Waldheim, who has been shunned by Western governments because of
accusations that he facilitated Nazi war crimes in World War II, is
scheduled to stop in Turkey on Wednesday en route home from a
Middle East visit.
   ``The American people and the American Congress have expressed
their view of Waldheim by banning him from even visiting the United
States,'' the telegram said.
   ``We wish to see Turkish-U.S. relations strengthened, and
receiving Waldheim would have a very negative effect,'' the
lawmakers said. The six representatives were: Tom Lantos, D-Calif.,
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., Lawrence Smith, D-Fla., Mel Levine,
D-Calif., Edward Feighan, D-Ohio, and Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y.
   Their subcommittee, headed by Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
oversees the administration's policy toward Turkey and recommends
to Congress the amount of aid the NATO ally receives each year.
   Despite intense State Department efforts, aid for Turkey has
been reduced steadily by Congress in recent years. The
administration asked for $914.9 million for Turkey in fiscal year
1988, but only got $525.3 million.
   Several members of the Senate, including Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., sent cables and letters to
Turkish Ambassador Sukru Elekdag urging his government to
reconsider its hosting of Waldheim.
   Meanwhile, Waldheim was greeted Monday in Kuwait with a red
carpet welcome and 21-gun salute at the start of his three-day
state visit. He had just completed a four-day visit to Syria.
   The topics for discussion in Kuwait were expected to be the same
as those in Syria: the Middle East peace process; the situation in
the Persian Gulf since Iran and Iraq stopped fighting; bilateral
relations and key international issues, officials said.
   The Justice Department last year placed Waldheim on a list of
people banned from the United States after reviewing evidence that
linked him with Nazi atrocities when he served as an officer in the
German army occupying the Balkans.
   In Ankara, the Foreign Ministry described Waldheim's visit as an
``unofficial stopover.'' Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz will greet
Waldheim at the airport in Istanbul and Evren will host a luncheon
for him later in the day.

<HEAD>Polls Find Dukakis Rated Better on Crime but Hamstrung in Own

   Michael Dukakis' counterattacks have improved
his rating as a crimefighter, but the Democratic presidential
nominee still suffers from unsteady support within his own party,
polls said Monday.
   Republican George Bush led by 11 points among likely voters in a
national survey by the Gallup Organization for the Times Mirror
Corp., 52 percent 41 percent, and by seven points, 52 percent 45
percent, in a poll by Louis Harris and Associates.
   The Times Mirror poll was done in the first half of last week;
the Harris poll was more recent, conducted Friday through Sunday.
Its 52-45 result was a very slight narrowing from 53-44 in a Harris
poll conducted Oct. 14-17.
   Dukakis only recently began to counter Bush's charges that he
was weak on crime, and the Harris poll indicated some results:
Fifty-three percent rated Dukakis soft on crime, still high but
down from 63 percent in the earlier poll.
   Harris also indicated that Dukakis had scored slightly by
portraying Bush's campaign advertisements as unfair. Seventy-five
percent called Bush's ads too negative, while 68 percent said the
same of Dukakis' ads.
   The Times Mirror poll, meanwhile, found support for Dukakis
uneven within his own party, while Bush marshalled monolithic
backing from Republicans and siphoned away some Democrats.
   Gallup said the presidential race has been largely stable for
months, with Bush ahead at least since September. But its poll
found an underlying factor in his favor: His supporters were more
loyal than they had been previously.
   Dukakis, meanwhile, has suffered slow erosion in his popularity,
to a point now lower than other candidates in recent years, the
poll said. And he lost support in some Democratic groups even while
gaining it in others.
   Bush's lead was based upon overwhelming support from
Republicans, solid backing from Republican-leaning independents and
``substantial defections'' from some Democratic groups, according
to Gallup's analysis of the results.
   ``For Dukakis, on the other hand, his support is not as strong
among his own partisans; and he is receiving virtually no
defections from members of core Republican groups,'' the analysis
said.
   The survey did find some room for change. Swing voters, those
who were undecided or said they might change their minds, made up
27 percent of the likely voters. And only about half of each
candidates' supporters backed them strongly.
   The problem in analyzing the race was Bush's stable lead on one
hand versus the softness of both candidates' support on the other.
``If Dukakis and the Dukakis campaign can get their act together
and speak to their constituencies or potential constituencies, they
can win it on the basis of the numbers,'' said Andrew Kohut,
Gallup's president. ``But that's a big if, given the course of the
campaign so far.''
   The Times Mirror poll divides the electorate into 10 evenly
sized groups whose members share general values. Its ``partisan
poor,'' for example, is a Democratic group; its ``enterprisers''
and ``moralists'' are Republican.
   Bush attracted 21 percent of the ``partisan poor,'' in the new
survey, significantly poaching in a Democratic stronghold. Dukakis,
by contrast, drew only 2 percent of the ``enterprisers'' and 3
percent of the ``moralists.''
   The last Times-Mirror poll, in September, identified
``disaffected'' voters, set apart by their suspicion of government,
as a swing group. After a nearly even division in May, they backed
Bush by 61-27 percent last month.
   In the new survey that preference held steady, and Bush's
supporters in the group grew more loyal to him: Fifty-one percent
said they were unlikely t switch to Dukakis, up from 36 percent
last month.
   ``In contrast, on the Democratic side, defections to George Bush
have doubled among `seculars' and significantly increased among the
`partisan poor,''' Gallup said. While Dukakis offset the losses
with gains in other Democratic groups, it said, the movement was
``indicative of the problems that the Dukakis campaign has had in
achieving enthusiastic support'' from some groups within his own
party.
   Additionally, among all registered voters, not just those likely
to vote, Dukakis was rated favorably by 48 percent, compared with
58 percent favorable for Bush. The poll analysis said Dukakis'
rating was ``significantly below'' those of most candidates in
recent presidential elections.
   The Times Mirror poll was conducted Oct. 23-26 among 2,006
registered voters, of whom 1,505 were considered likely to vote.
The error margin for the likely voter group was plus or minus three
points. The Harris poll was done among 1,250 likely voters and also
had a three-point margin of error.
   In a state poll Monday, ABC News put the race in California at
51 percent for Bush to 44 percent for Dukakis. That survey was done
Saturday and Sunday among 510 likely voters; while the spread was
within its margin of error of five points, other recent polls also
have found Bush slightly ahead there.
   In a separate poll in Missouri, Bush led Dukakis 53 percent to
39 percent among 397 likely voters. The poll was taken last Monday
through Thursday and had a margin of error of four points.
   In Wisconsin, a survey of 1,019 likely voters Sunday through
Thursday found Bush leading 45-40. The survey had a margin of error
of three points.

   Florentine voters overwhelmingly approved
in a non-binding referendum a plan to limit traffic in the city's
historic center, election results showed Monday.
   Returns from Saturday's poll indicated about 72 percent of the
voters favored an immediate and complete closure of the center to
private automobiles.
   The city said 154,120 people, about 43 percent of Florence's
354,730 registered voters, cast ballots.
   Voters indicated they want traffic closed completely to private
cars in an area bounded by the Arno River and Viale di
Circonvallazione, the street that circles the center. Florence
already has some restrictions on traffic there.
   The referendum does not require the city council to act. It was
designed to demonstrate to the city government voters' feelings on
the measure.
   Rome also is weighing further restrictions on its own city
center traffic because of pollution and congestion.

   A Yugoslav military tribunal
convicted an ethnic Albanian soldier of belonging to a hostile
separatist organization and sentenced him to five years in jail
Monday, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   It said Pvt. Ismail Rasiti, 20, admitted at a court-martial in
Sarajevo, central Yugoslavia, that he organized an ethnic Albanian
nationalist group called the ``Burning Torch'' at a nearby garrison
last June.
   The ethnic Albanian minority, centered mostly in southern Kosovo
province, makes up about 9 percent of Yugoslavia's population of 23
million.
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians have been arrested since bloody
riots shook Kosovo in 1981, during a drive to obtain more autonomy
for the province.

   John Houseman, the producer who terrified
millions with the ``War of the Worlds'' and won an Oscar for
intimidating his students as the imperious law professor in ``The
Paper Chase,'' died Monday. He was 86.
   Houseman died at his seaside home before dawn, said Ivan Goff, a
family friend and scriptwriter. Margo Harley, a longtime friend and
colleague, said he had spinal cancer.
   Houseman brought a magnetic eloquence to the role of the
curmudgeon and gained wide fame while in his 70s as Professor
Charles W. Kingsfield in ``The Paper Chase,'' a role he first
played in the 1973 film and then in the television series.
   He parlayed his fame and his distinctive speaking style into a
lucrative series of commercial endorsements, including ads for the
investment firm Smith, Barney in which he growled, ``They make
money the old-fashioned way _ they EARRNNN it.''
   Houseman's characters were marked by a stern, autocratic tone,
yet those who knew him well described him as quiet and gentle.
   ``Behind that austere public posture was the warmest, most
generous man in the world _ with his time, his remarkable
intelligence, his insight,'' said writer David Rintels, who
collaborated with Houseman on the movie ``Gideon's Trumpet'' and
the play ``Clarence Darrow.''
   Said actor Kirk Douglas: ``He was a gentleman of the old school,
polite and courtly. He had wonderful manners. He was an unusual
character and I'm going to miss him.''
   While he was best known for his work on screen, Houseman's
strongest affections were the theater, book writing and teaching.
His acting students included Kevin Kline, Robin Williams,
Christopher Reeve, Patti LuPone and David Ogden Stiers. Houseman
appears in the new Woody Allen movie, ``Another Woman,'' in which
Stiers plays a younger Houseman.
   ``He was somebody who has been responsible, probably, for more
people's careers in American theater than any single person, and
we're going to miss him very, very much,'' Ms. Harley said.
   At the time of his death, Houseman had achieved what he told
friends was his ultimate dream: the establishment of The Acting
Company, a touring theatrical ensemble of the nation's brightest
talents.
   Houseman co-produced the ``War of the Worlds'' radio drama for
Orson Welles. He later apologized for the nationwide panic induced
by the program about invading Martians which aired 50 years ago
Sunday.
   Born Jacques Haussmann in Bucharest, Romania, the veteran actor,
director and producer launched his career in 1934 as the director
of a Broadway production of the Gertrude Stein-Virgil Thomson opera
``Four Saints in Three Acts.''
   In 1937 he helped Welles form New York's Mercury Theatre, and he
co-wrote the original story for Welles' legendary film ``Citizen
Kane'' in 1941.
   During a tribute in Los Angeles to him in 1987, Houseman said,
``The only important thing when you've lived as long as I have is
what you've accomplished _ a body of work. ... We all tend to talk
about our successes. At least as important are our failures.''
   He had many successes to boast about.
   Houseman played small roles in the 1938 film ``Too Much
Johnson'' and in the 1964 film ``Seven Days in May'' before
emerging as a strong film actor in ``The Paper Chase.'' He won a
best supporting actor for his portrayal of Kingsfield.
   His film acting credits include ``Rollerball,'' ``Three Days of
the Condor,'' ``The Cheap Detective'' ``St. Ives,'' ``Old
Boyfriends,'' ``The Fog,'' ``Ghost Story'' and ``Bright Lights, Big
City.''
   He starred in the CBS television series based on the movie ``The
Paper Chase,'' and after its cancellation, he stayed with the
series for several years on Showtime pay television.
   Houseman starred in the ABC miniseries ``The Winds of War'' as
Dr. Aaron Jastrow, a Jewish scholar in Europe at the start of World
War II, but the role was taken over by Sir John Gielgud for the
sequel, ``War and Remembrance,'' which ABC will telecast beginning
Nov. 13.
   During World War II, Houseman was head of the Voice of America.
In the 1950s he produced a television classic, ``The Seven Lively
Arts.'' He also produced a number of ``Playhouse 90'' shows.
   Houseman also appeared in the miniseries ``Washington: Behind
Closed Doors'' and ``Aspen.'' One of his last appearances was a
year ago as co-anchorman on the NBC comedy special ``Our Planet
Tonight.''
   In September, Houseman said he had no plans to slow down.
   ``I have tapered off a little, but I wouldn't know what to do
with myself if I retired,'' he said three days before his 86th
birthday. ``I still have something to offer, even though the roles
these days are usually small.
   ``But I'm 85 years old. I am not going to be offered the role of
Romeo anymore, or Juliet, for that matter. Yet the limited range I
do play, I play well. My range is that of an old man, but what do
you expect from someone who started acting at the age of 70?''
   Houseman is survived by his wife, Joan, and sons John Michael
and Charles Sebastian. There will be no funeral, but a memorial
service was being planned, said publicist Judi Davidson.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega on Monday
extended a 7-month-old cease-fire with anti-Sandinista rebels until
the end of November.
   The government newspaper Barricada urged Nicaraguans to prepare
for a U.S. invasion.
   A statement released by Ortega's office said the president
extended the truce ``with the objective of enabling Contra (rebel)
groups to put down their arms, take advantage of the amnesty and
enter the normal life of the country.''
   The cease-fire would have expired Nov. 1. Monday's action was
the sixth one-month extrension by the government. The U.S.-backed
rebels have said they extended the cease-fire indefinitely.
   The formal truce went into effect April 1.
   Sandinistas and rebels agreed on March 21 to halt operations
involving military offense. Two days later they signed a pact
agreeing to try to negotiate a peaceful settlement of their
8-year-old war.
   Talks on a permanent settlement became stalemated in September.
Each side has accused the other of frequent violations of the truce.
   Monday's statement said Ortega's decision ``will not affect
popular mobilization plans for the defense of the fatherland.''
   Barricada said the possibility of a U.S. invasion was increasing.
   Under the headline ``Rising Threat,'' an editorial said Honduran
troops on Sunday harassed a Nicaraguan border village and accused
Honduras of what it called a recent series of cross-border attacks.
   The government claims the attacks are part of U.S. plan to
provoke a border war with Honduras and American troops then would
invade to back Honduras.
   A Barricada caption under a map of a region of Honduras that
juts into Nicaragua said about 40 Honduran military posts had been
established in the area to protect 4,000 Nicaraguan rebels in camps
in Honduran territory.
   Last week Ortega claimed the United States armed 3,000 rebels
and ordered them back into Nicaragua to take advantage of the
destruction left by Hurricane Joan that slashed across Nicaragua on
Oct. 22.
   ``Facing this new escalation of Yankee aggression the people
will have to strengthen their forces and mobilize ... their
combatants because we can't permit genocide,'' Barricada said.

   A man admitted Monday he took part in
an arson fire that destroyed a church which had just been rebuilt
from a similar blaze, authorities said.
   The Oct. 18 fire destroyed the 125-year-old New Bethel Church of
Rock Fork. It was the second arson fire at the African Methodist
Episcopal facility in six months.
   Madison County Sheriff Bob Churchich declined to identify the
man, who was charged with a single count of arson and was being
held on $100,000 bond.
   Members of the church's black congregation have complained of
racially motivated vandalism. Last year, racial epithets were
carved into the walls, and swastikas were spray-painted on the
church.
   Then, on April 16, the building was destroyed by fire.
   Undaunted, the congregation voted to rebuild the frame building
on the same spot in Godfrey, a town of 1,000. The church stood at
the end of a gravel road in a remote, wooded area near a mostly
white neighborhood.
   New Bethel was set to reopen Nov. 6 but was destroyed a second
time.
   ``It hurts. I cry practically every day,'' said Virginia
DeBruce, 63, whose great-grandparents escaped slavery and organized
the church in 1863. ``I feel like I have lost somebody in my
family.''
   Investigators declined to say if the man in custody was
implicated in the first fire.

   Two gambling clubs and a lone player
will share a $61.98 million lottery jackpot that officials say is
the world's largest, it was announced Monday.
   The windfall will be divided among a group of 25 Sears employees
in Sacramento, 15 hospital workers in San Diego County, and Ron
Smith, a 45-year-old Shell Oil Co. production supervisor who lives
in Westminster, said lottery spokesman Bob Taylor.
   Each of the groups and Smith will receive one-third of the
jackpot, or nearly $20.66 million, which will be paid over two
decades in equal annual payments after taxes, Taylor said. The
lottery deducts 20 percent of winnings for federal income taxes.
   Officials said the Sears workers will get an estimated $33,000
annually after taxes for 20 years; the hospital workers, $55,000
each year for two decades after taxes; and Smith, $826,400 annually
after taxes for 20 years.
   Most of the 15 workers from the hospital in Fallbrook arrived at
a lottery district office in San Diego riding in limousines to
present their winning ticket.
   At Fallbrook Hospital, respiratory therapist and winner Jeff
Wilson declared, ``I'm about the only working millionaire at this
place today. Everybody else is off.''
   The overall jackpot increased from an estimated $60.8 million to
$61.98 million when annuities that will be used to make payments to
winners were purchased Monday, said Taylor.
   ``We're very common, real people,'' said Smith's wife, Linda.
``We have our friends and this is our house. We're not going to
move.''
   The two now earn about $40,000 a year. Smith said he plans to
quit his job so he and his wife can travel.
   Smith said he went to work Sunday and told co-workers of his
good fortune. ``They thought I was kidding,'' he said. ``Then they
decided I was serious.''
   Appliance repairman Frank T. Kopita, 42, of the El Dorado County
town of Shingle Springs, 30 miles east of Sacramento, held the
winning ticket for the group of Sears workers, lottery officials
said.
   The lottery first scheduled, then canceled a news conference
with the Sacramento winners. The employees said they wanted to
avoid the publicity and had to return to work, said lottery
spokeswoman Kim Rendahl.
   A woman who identified herself only as Shirley at the Sears
service center said she was one of 25 people in the pool there who
won. ``I'm pretty excited about it. Wouldn't anybody be?'' she said.
   Surinder Sanghera, owner of Sangheras House of Liquors in
Sacramento, where the Sears group bought its tickets, said of its
members: ``They are regulars. I think they've been buying here
since the lotto began.''
   Colleen M. Peach-Van Horn, a 36-year-old intensive care nurse,
held the winning ticket for 15 Fallbrook Hospital workers in San
Diego County.
   Carrie Dragon, a technician at the hospital, said she joined 13
nurses, laboratory technicians and other employees _ as well as a
friend of one of the workers _ in putting $40 each toward the
tickets. All told, she said, the group bought $600 worth of tickets.
   Wilson, another of the hospital winners, said he really hadn't
had much of a chance yet to celebrate.
   ``Monday mornings are busy around this place anyway,'' he said.
``Betwixt and between seeing my patients, I've had many
congratulations.''
   Asked what he planned to do with the money, Wilson said, ``I'd
like to pay my son's tuition (at University of California, Davis)
and maybe take a little vacation.''
   Bill McKeel, manager at the Circle K store where the group
bought tickets, said that half an hour after the drawing one member
of the group walked in to pick up the computer printout of winning
numbers.
   ``He got it, kissed it and started walking back out to his
truck, but before he could leave he had to sit down on the curb to
collect himself,'' McKeel said.
   The members of both winning groups will be responsible for
making their own arrangements to divide the money. The lottery pays
out to a single winner, the person holding the ticket.
   The jackpot was the world's largest lottery prize, Taylor said.
   The previous record was $56 million in Spain's El Gordo lottery
in 1983. The previous North American record was a $55.16 million
jackpot in Florida lotto last month, but that prize went to a
single winner.
   The winning numbers that produced the windfalls for 41 players
in Saturday night's ``Lotto 6@49'' drawing were: 5, 20, 26, 28, 32,
and 39.
   The jackpot soared because for the fourth consecutive time
nobody picked the six winning numbers between 1 and 49 in
Wednesday's $33.4 million drawing. The jackpot rolled over to the
Saturday game and grew with each ticket sale.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A lawyer who specialized in
land-dispute cases was stopped on a road and killed by two gunmen
wearing army uniforms, radio Haiti Inter reported Monday.
   It identified the victim as Jacques Phillipe, in his 30s, and
said one of two men traveling with the lawyer also may have been
killed.
   It did not identify the two companions but attributed its report
to the one known survivor.
   According to the broadcast, Phillippe and his friends were
driving back to Port-au-Prince from the town of St. Marc, 59 miles
north of the capital, when their car was stopped by two gunmen in
uniforms who forced their way into the vehicle.
   About six miles north of Port-au-Prince Philippe was told to
stop the car and his two companions were told to ``take to their
heels,'' the radio said.
   After shooting Phillipe the killers chased the two other men.
The survivor said he believed the other victim was shot to death in
a nearby canefield. The survivor made it safely to the army post of
Bon Ripos.
   Armed gangs committing crimes in and around Port-au-Prince are
believed to be former members of the disbanded Tonton Macoutes, the
private army of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier who fled to France in
February 1986 during anti-government violence.

   Defense Minister Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala
welcomed Frank C. Carlucci at Cairo International Airport on Monday
upon the U.S. defense secretary's arrival for a two-day official
visit.
   Carlucci flew in from Jordan and will go to Israel on Wednesday,
the final stop on his three-nation Middle East tour.
   He meets separately Tuesday with President Hosni Mubarak and
Abu-Ghazala, focusing on U.S.-Egyptian military cooperation and
Middle East problems.
   Abu-Ghazala told reporters hours before Carlucci landed that the
visit ``is in the context of the good relationship between the two
countries. Relations between the armed forces in the two countries
are very good.''
   Since 1980, Egypt has been the second largest recipient of U.S.
military aid after Israel. The aid to Cairo averages $1.3 billion
annually and has been comprised of outright grants since 1984.
   On a visit to Washington last March, Abu-Ghazala signed a
10-year memorandum of understanding with Carlucci, giving Egypt
special status as a strategic ally outside the framework of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Only Israel, Sweden and
Australia have similar accords with the United States.
   Abu-Ghazala said Monday that among topics he and Carlucci will
discuss is coproduction of the U.S.-designed M-1A1 Abrams tank.
   The Pentagon has valued the deal at $2 billion. It said the
transaction involves sale of 555 M-1A1s and that as many as 545 of
them could be built on a new assembly line in Egypt.

Wallenberg.
   Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat, saved tens of thousands of
people from Nazi death camps and was arrested by Soviet forces in
Hungary at the end of World War II. Moscow said he died in a Soviet
prison in 1947, but Soviet dissident sources said he was seen in
the 1980s.
   Carlsson told a Swedish national television reporter that ``it
is our hope that with the new (Soviet) leadership we will get
absolute clarity in the Raoul Wallenberg case.''
   He indicated that Sweden will raise the issue at its next
high-level meeting with the Soviet Union.
   Wallenberg would be 76 years old if he is still alive.

   The coach of the Romanian women's fencing

Anatolia News Agency reported Monday.
   The dispatch quoted Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk as saying
the request by Pirip Karhita Doiana was under official
consideration. ``She is now our guest at security headquarters in
Ankara,'' it quoted Beduk as saying.
   Anatolia said the coach, here for the Balkan fencing

   A church leader gave Salvadoran
rebels a report Monday on proposals for a negotiated solution to
their 9-year-old war with U.S.-backed governments of El Salvador.
   Arturo Rivera Damas, Roman Catholic archbishop of San Salvador,
said the proposal was based on observations about the political,
social, military and economic situation from more than 60
Salvadoran organizations.
   Rebel leader Joaquin Villalobos said the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, the umbrella organization for five
Salvadoran guerrilla groups, considered the report positive because
it demands ``an end to the war and the reasons that led to it.''
   He and rebel representative Leonel Gonzalez added, however, that
reopening talks with the government would be difficult.
   Rivera Damas presented the report on what he called a ``national
debate'' during a ceremony at a military installation attended by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's military commander and de
facto ruler.
   Villalobos and Gonzalez met with Noriega and later said they
briefed him on visits by rebel representatives to Peru, Argentina,
Ecuador and Costa Rica to promote a negotiated settlement.
   They said rebel officials would return to those countries to
inform the government leaders of their meeting with the archbishop.
   Rivera Damas said the report contained 140 ideas offered by the
60 organizations in several days of meetings with church leaders,
but he gave no details.
   Salvadoran church leaders have mediated the few meetings between
the government and rebels, and frequently urge that talks resume.
The last meeting was Oct. 20, 1987 in San Salvador, the capital of
El Salvador.
   Gonzalez said the report ``can reactivate the peace process,''
but another round of talks with the government of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte ``isn't easy now.''
   ``Negotiations in El Salvador are quite complicated,'' Gonzalez
said. ``The Americans oppose them, Duarte opposes them, parts of
the private sector oppose them so we have to build relations among
forces to open negotiations.''
   He said the rebels have set no preconditions for talks but
rejected previous government demands that the rebels lay down their
weapons.
   ``We have given them the message that we are ready to talk with
all social forces, including the army, that we are ready to talk at
any place or time,'' Gonzalez said.
   ``The one that's established conditions is the government,'' he
said. ``Duarte has said that in order to talk again with the FMLN
(rebels' front) we have to put down our arms. This is absurd, it's
inadmissible.''
   Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said Monday that
Salvadoran rebels had killed the mayor of a small town in Morazan,
a western province in the war zone. The army said 53 rebels and 29
soldiers were killed in several skirmishes in October.

<HEAD>Ban on Wild Horse `Adoption' Upheld</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal ``adopt-a-horse'' program that is
supposed to protect wild horses and burros is actually sending some
of them to slaughter, a federal appeals court said Monday in
upholding restrictions on the program.
   The Bureau of Land Management ``renders the adoption process a
farce'' by failing to screen out owners whose intention is killing
the horses for use as pet food, said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   The 3-0 decision prohibits the BLM from transferring title of
any wild horse or burro to a person who is known to intend
commercial exploitation _ slaughter or use in a rodeo.
   The court did not say what steps the government agency must take
to learn the intent of a would-be owner. But the ruling was hailed
by animal-rights organizations who filed the lawsuit.
   ``We were determined from the start that the blood money of
these `national treasures,' as the Wild and Free-Roaming Horse and
Burro Act defined these animals, should not end in the hands of
already amply paid profiteers,'' said writer Cleveland Amory,
founder and president of the Fund for Animals, one group involved
in the lawsuit.
   He said it was also important that the court had recognized the
right of animal-rights organizations to challenge the BLM's
management of animals.
   Craig James, a lawyer for Amory's group, said the BLM reportedly
has suspended its adoption program and replaced it with other
protective measures, such as a sanctuary for wild horses.
   But he said the ruling could determine the fate of many of the
estimated 8,000 wild horses that have been adopted in the last
year. Under a BLM policy challenged in the lawsuit, the agency does
not not inquire as to the intentions of an adopter who has taken
humane care of a horse for a year.
   The heaviest population of the horses is in Nevada, but James
said they can be found over a wide area west of the Rocky Mountains.
   A 1971 federal law, which described the wild horses as ``living
symnbols of the historic and pioneer spirit,'' ordered protective
measures for the animals on public lands.
   Later laws set up the adoption program, in which people could
pay the government $125 per horse and $75 per burro for the right
to tame up to four animals for riding or make other uses of them.
The BLM is allowed to transfer ownership of an animal to an adopter
who has assured humane treatment and has taken good care of the
animal for a year.
   Animal rights groups filed suit in 1985 after the BLM said it
would waive fees for animals that were considered ``unadoptable.''
In response to the lawsuit, the BLM conceded that it had allowed
adoption of horses by some people who intended slaughter or other
commercial exploitation.
   But the government agency argued that it was within its
authority, since another federal law allowed the humane destruction
of wild horses that cannot be adopted.
   That authority has never been used, however, and was suspended
by Congress this year, the court said.
   In upholding a ruling by U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben,
the appeals court rejected the BLM's argument that it can transfer
title to anyone who has taken proper care of a wild horse for a
year, regardless of future intentions.
   The agency's ``disregard for the announced future intentions of
adopters undercuts Congress' desire to ensure humane treatment for
wild horses and burros,'' said the opinion by Judge Herbert Choy.
   ``In fact, it renders the adoption process a farce, for the
one-year requirement of humane treatment and care serves no purpose
if on the day the one-year period expires, the adopter can proceed
to the slaughterhouse.''
   The court did not say whether the BLM had the authority to waive
adoption fees.

   American hostage Terry Anderson, in a
videotape released Monday by his kidnappers, read a statement that
accused the Reagan administration of blocking his release and urged
the next president to do more.
   President Reagan denied interfering with efforts to free
Anderson, and his chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, denounced the
tape as ``a cynical attempt'' to influence the Nov. 8 election.
   Copies of the 2-minute, 35-second tape were delivered to two
Western news agencies in Beirut four days after Anderson, 41,
marked his fourth birthday in captivity.
   Statements from the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, which holds
Anderson, accompanied the tapes.
   ``On the occasion of Terry Anderson's birthday and in response
to your letters, and according to his desire to send you a recorded
message, we hereby enclose with this statement the recorded message
on videotape,'' the kidnappers said.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, began the message by identifying himself and saying the date
was Oct. 30.
   ``Once again I'm being given a chance to speak to my family, to
my friends and to the American people,'' he said.
   Anderson said his spirits were boosted by the birthday greetings
he received, ``But as my fourth birthday in captivity passes and as
the end of my fourth year (in captivity) approaches, I find it
difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high.''
   ``I've been very close to being released several times over the
past two years. But each time it seems that the U.S. government
uses its influence to stop any agreement from being made. And I
don't understand this.''
   In Los Angeles, Reagan told reporters his administration had
done everything possible to win the hostages' freedom. ``I don't
think that was Terry speaking,'' he said. ``I think he had a script
that was given to him.''
   When asked about the statement on the tape that the U.S.
government interfered when the hostages were about to be released,
Reagan said, ``That is absolutely not true, but let me point
something out. Terry Anderson in that terrible confinement at the
hands of those barbarians _ any information he has has to have come
from there; there is no contact with the outside world.''
   ``We have been doing everything we can for the release of the
hostages, and the very simple answer is, for those people, to let
them go,'' the president said.
   Anderson said, ``I gather there's been very little discussion
about this problem in the U.S. presidential campaign and that's
disappointing, as is President Reagan's complete failure to find a
solution during his eight years in office.
   ``But whichever candidate wins this election, remember an
unyielding refusal to deal with this matter is not going to make it
go away. It is not going to free us.''
   He urged the next president to use his influence ``in a positive
way, not a negative one,'' to end his plight.
   Of the two candidates, Anderson singled out Vice President
George Bush.
   ``I'm not asking President Reagan to deal with terrorists,
although both he and Mr. Bush did so in the Iran-Contra affair and
the TWA hijack,'' the message said.
   Bush has not been named previously as a negotiator in the 1985
jet hijacking, in which Shiite Moslems demanding freedom for Shiite
prisoners held 39 Americans for 17 days and killed a U.S. Navy
diver.
   The vice president has minimized his role in the sale of arms to
Iran. The deal became known as the Iran-Contra affair when it was
revealed that money for the arms was funneled to Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   Fitzwater said the comments about Bush were ``totally incorrect,
wrong.''
   Anderson appeared from the waist up. He was dressed in a gray
track suit and read the statement in a steady voice. He was shaven,
his hair was combed, and he wore glasses. He said he was being
treated well.
   It was the third videotaped message from Anderson released by
the Islamic Jihad, which kidnapped Anderson on March 16, 1985. He
is the longest-held of the 14 foreign hostages. Nine are Americans.
   The previous two messages were released Oct. 3, 1986 and Dec.
24, 1987.
   In addition to Anderson, Islamic Jihad holds Thomas Sutherland,
56, of Fort Collins, Colo. He was acting dean of agriculture at The
American University of Beirut when he was kidnapped June 19, 1985.
   Islamic Jihad has freed three American hostages in the last
three years _the Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister; the
Rev. Martin Lawrence Jenco, a Roman Catholic priest; and David
Jacobsen, former director of the American University Hospital in
Beirut.
   Jacobsen's release on Nov. 2, 1986, was linked to the U.S. arms
sales to Iran.
   ``Our problem could have been solved long ago without such
complications as arms deals,'' Anderson said in his message.
   ``I heard on the radio of the generous and ambitious efforts to
free three trapped whales a few days ago and the president's thanks
to the Soviet Union for its help. It is a warming story,'' he said.
``That kind of cooperation and spirit is absolutely necessary to
bring this situation to an end.''
   The tape ended with a message to his family: ``Peg, Madeleine,
Dad, kiss my daughters for me. Keep your spirits up and I will try
to do the same, and one day soon, God willing, this will end.''
   Anderson has two daughters, Gabrielle, 13, and Sulome, 3. The
reference to ``Dad'' indicated Anderson does not know his father
died in 1986.
   ``Peg'' referred to his sister, Peggy Say, and ``Madeleine'' is
Madeleine Basil, the mother of Sulome.
   Mrs. Say, in Batavia, N.Y. on Monday, said she continues hoping
for Anderson's release, but has given up criticizing federal policy
against conceding to her brother's kidnappers.
   ``You come to a place where you understand that when a horse
dies you get off it,'' she said. ``The hostages are not a great
enough number to excite the masses.''
   But ``if there were a plane load of Americans,'' she asked,
``would we allow our president to not lift a finger?''

   The intense, two-week takeover battle for Kraft
Inc. was rather like the storm before the calm, as analysts said
Monday they expect Philip Morris Cos. Inc. to make few changes in
the company it is buying for $13.1 billion.
   ``I suspect we'll have Kraft left alone for a year,'' said
Ronald B. Morrow, who tracks both companies for the investment firm
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Diana Temple, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., agreed,
saying, ``It appears that both companies will be run separately.''
   Morrow based his prediction on Philip Morris' history. ``When
they bought General Foods, they left it alone for two years,'' he
said, referring to the 1985 purchase of another major U.S. food
manufacturer.
   Philip Morris executives did not seek changes in General Foods
until the division began having problems, Morrow noted, adding that
he did not anticipate similar steps to be taken at Kraft.
   ``Kraft manages their business better than General Foods does,''
he said.
   In fact, Philip Morris might draw on Kraft's expertise to help
General Foods' sales and earnings growth, which have flagged in
recent years. ``There are more problems at General Foods that Kraft
could fix,'' Morrow said.
   Kraft and Philip Morris announced Sunday that they had signed an
agreement under which Philip Morris would boost its tender offer
for all of Kraft's outstanding stock to $106 a share from $90. The
Kraft board said it was recommending shareholders accept the deal.
   It appeared Monday Kraft investors would enthusiastically
endorse the acquisition. The company's stock soared $7 a share to
$103.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris rose 62{
cents a share to $95.37{.
   Kraft had bitterly opposed as inadequate the initial $90-a-share
offer Philip Morris made Oct. 17. Kraft then unveiled a defensive
restructuring that would pay stockholders a package of cash and
securities that Kraft valued at $110 a share.
   After negotiations Friday in Chicago, company officials worked
out a preliminary agreement that the Kraft board approved at a
meeting in New York, Philip Morris Chairman Hamish Maxwell said.
   The acquisition _ the largest combination of non-oil companies
in the United States _ would fulfill Philip Morris' goal of
reducing its dependence on revenue from its slowing cigarette
business. It also would become a tougher competitor against other
giant multinational corporations like Unilever, the giant
Anglo-Dutch concern that Philip Morris will displace as the world's
biggest consumer products company.
   ``It will boost Philip Morris' sales from about $30 billion in
1988 to $45.5 billion in 1989,'' Ms. Temple predicted, adding that
the combination ``will boost non-tobacco operations to up to 35
percent of sales.''
   The acquisition would add well-known Kraft labels such as
Velveeta processed cheese, Parkay margarine, Philadelphia cream
cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Sealtest ice cream to
popular Philip Morris brands like Miller beer, Marlboro cigarettes,
Jell-O and Maxwell House coffee.
   The combination also would create the world's second biggest
food products operation after Switzerland's Nestle SA.
   In Washington, D.C., Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum said Monday he
has asked the Federal Trade Commission to launch an antitrust
investigation of the deal. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the resulting
company would be so large it could seriously affect competition and
raise the prices of prepared foods.
   Metzenbaum is chairman of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
antitrust, monopolies and business rights.
   FTC spokesman Howard Shapiro said the agency would not comment
on whether it was looking into the merger.
   Maxwell said there were no plans to sell any major Kraft assets.
   While the analysts expected Kraft and General Foods to exist as
separate entities for the near-future, they said they did not
expect the honeymoon to last forever.
   ``It would make sense if they were combined,'' because the new
company could save on manufacturing, distribution and
administrative costs, Morrow said.

   President Reagan on Monday rejected as
``absolutely not true'' charges that he and Vice President George
Bush made deals with terrorists and deliberately thwarted the
release of hostages held in Lebanon.
   Responding to allegations read by American hostage Terry
Anderson in a new videotape released by his pro-Iranian captors in
Lebanon, Reagan said ``I don't think that was Terry speaking. I
think he had a script that was given to him.''
   Reagan was asked about the tape at a ceremony where he signed
legislation that offers U.S. artists and writers copyright
protections under an international treaty.
   On the two-minute, 35-second tape, Anderson, the chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, voiced a statement
accusing the U.S. government of preventing his release. The
statement also accused Bush of having dealt with terrorists in the
1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and in the Iran-Contra arms deal,
another allegation Reagan denied.
   Bush, interviewed on the NBC Nightly News, said, ``I had no role
that you are aware of or not aware of, absolutely,'' in the TWA
hijacking negotiations.
   The Republican presidential candidate also said he was ``a
little bit optimistic about their letting these hostages out. I
think with Iran-Iraq having a cease-fire, I think it's in Iran's
interest, though they don't hold the hostages, to do what they can
to encourage their release. I think it would set whoever is elected
president a good tone for the possibility of improved relations.''
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater had denounced
the kidnappers, accusing them of ``a cynical attempt'' to use the
hostages to influence the U.S. presidential election.
   Contrary to many instances in the past, the president spoke at
length with reporters about the latest hostage tape. Reagan
appeared eager to discuss the matter, and stepped up to the
microphone to answer reporters' questions.
   Queried whether the U.S. government had interfered when the
hostages were about to be released, Reagan said, ``That is
absolutely not true, but let me point something out. Terry Anderson
_ in that terrible confinement at the hands of those barbarians _
any information he has, has to have come from there; there is no
contact with the outside world.''
   Reagan insisted that his administration has been ``doing
everything we can for the release of the hostages, and the very
simple answer is, for those people, to let them go.''
   ``There has never been any interference, nor have we ever been
negotiating any more than we would with any other kind of a
kidnapper on a ransom type of basis,'' he said.
   When asked whether he thought the kidnappers were trying to
influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, he said,
``You'd have to ask them; I can't fathom their minds.''
   Reagan then went on to dispute the charge on the tape that Bush
was involved in negotiations in the sale of arms to Iran and in
resolving the 1985 Middle East hijacking of a TWA jet. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed by the hijackers during that ordeal.
   ``Nor was I, because we were never doing anything of that
kind,'' Reagan replied.
   Asked again if Bush had played a role in negotiations for the
release of the TWA hostages, Reagan launched into a spirited
defense of his vice president, saying ``George has been a part of
everything we've accomplished. I've always felt that a vice
president should be an executive vice president, as in a
corporation, and not somebody sitting over on the sidelines waiting
for me to have a relapse.''
   Reagan went on: ``He's been a part of that, but in a
constructive way, and that's why he's my choice in this coming
election.''
   But when pressed again whether he was answering `yes,' to Bush's
alleged involvement in the TWA hijacking, Reagan turned to answer
another query about the circumstances of the release of the tape.
   Bush told NBC he was never involved in negotiations either in
the TWA or the Iran-Contra cases, according to press secretary
Sheila Tate.
   The vice president previously has said he was not a key player
in the sale of arms to Iran and was unaware of details and planning
of it.
   Pressed to explain his and Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contra
affair _ which the questioner described as having developed into a
scandal _ the president shot back, ``There was no scandal. That
scandal, I'm afraid, has been artificially created by a media that
I cannot understand.''
   About prospects for release of Anderson and other Americans held
in Lebanon, the president said, ``I'm not going to give up hope for
any of our hostages that are held; that's just too unthinkable.''
   But, he said, ``the one thing we cannot do is negotiate with the
kidnappers on a sort of ransom idea because that just encourages
more kidnaping and more hostage-taking.''
   Asked what about Anderson's statement that the United States
appeared to show more interest in the release of the two gray
whales trapped in the ice of Alaska than the fate of the hostages,
Reagan responded again that he believed Anderson was only reading a
script that had been given him.
   ``When I was given a script, I always read the lines,'' he added.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said Monday her brother looked
stronger than in the past, adding, ``He seemed somewhat relaxed. I
didn't see the kind of tension or fear that has come across in some
of the pictures (released in the past).''
   She said she has given up criticizing federal policy against
negotiating with her brother's kidnappers.
   ``You come to a place where you understand that when a horse
dies you get off it,'' Say said. ``The hostages are not a great
enough number to excite the masses. (But) if there were a plane
load of Americans, would we allow our president to not lift a
finger?''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American soprano Catherine Malfitano was cheered
after a great performance in the title role of ``Madama Butterfly''
on Monday night at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.
   The house had been sold out for weeks for the new production of
Giacomo Puccini's opera by Spanish actress and theater director
Nuria Espert. Ms. Espert shared the acclaim when she joined the
cast and production team in taking 11 curtain calls.
   Few women producers are in the opera business. Ms. Espert, who
has her own theater company in Madrid, has done only one other
opera. But she is quickly adding a reputation for the difficult art
to her fame as an actress and stage director.
   Asked later in a dressing-room interview if she found any
difference between direction by a woman and a man, Ms. Malfitano
replied, ``There isn't any. But Nuria is full of wonderful ideas
and I was able to ask her questions about the role which I would
have been hesitant to put to a man.''
   The New York-born singer added, ``If there is a difference, it's
a sense that she feels things I might feel about the character
because she is a woman. But that's not to say that men aren't
intuitive and sensitive.''
   Ms. Malfitano gave a heart-tugging interpretation of
Cio-Cio-San, the Japanese geisha girl known as Butterfly who falls
in love with U.S. Navy officer Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton.
   In what looks like a very un-Japanese reaction, the singer
writhes on the floor of her tenement apartment when she learns that
Pinkerton has deserted her and intends to take their son away.
   ``Nuria had me do that _ we both have great love for
Cio-Cio-San,'' Ms. Malfitano explained.
   ``We didn't do it from a Japanese viewpoint. This is an opera by
a European and it's a European view of Japan. But I think reaction
to pain and grief is universal.
   ``When we are alone we do things the world would not expect to
see. It's a private moment that's very painful, an extreme moment
we express in an extreme way. It should be shocking and almost
surprising and it has the ring of truth,'' the singer said.
   Ms. Malfitano's dark-eyed beauty was enhanced by her long hair,
worn down to her waist in the role.
   ``Yes, it is my own _ people are always asking me,'' she said,
laughing.
   Her father's parents emigrated to the United States from
Linguaglossa and Fiumefreddo di Sicilia in the foothills of the Mt.
Etna volcano.
   Welsh tenor Arthur Davies, who sang Pinkerton, also said he
found no difference in being directed by a woman.
   Chewing on a piece of butterscotch _ ``It moistens the mouth and
I just happened to have it in my pocket'' _ he said: ``Nuria knows
the piece and it's just a matter of interpretation. It's what she
wanted and I hope we've made sense of it.''
   The opera was first staged as a contemporary story in 1904. Ms.
Espert places it in 1937 to heighten the tension between Americans
and Japanese, four years before the attack at Pearl Harbor. But she
does not transform the story in any way. She said before the first
night she doesn't believe in ``director's opera.''
   ``It is just a fashion. In opera, the true director is the
composer and everything is in the music. You need a very good ear
and to listen carefully,'' Ms. Espert told London's Daily Telegraph.
   The cleverly designed tenement, set on three floors, was by
Italy's Ezio Frigerio. His wife, Franca Squarciapino, did the
costumes.
   Denmark's Michael Schonwandt seemed to draw everything possible
from his conducting of the opera house orchestra.
   Mezzo-soprano Miao Qing, who sang the role of Cio-Cio-San's
servant, Suzuki, in her British debut, is the first Chinese artist
to sing with the Royal Opera and she looked delighted, waving her
bouquet at the audience.
   Ms. Malfitano was given three bouquets and happily carried the
largest of them away with her, walking down Floral Street with her
husband Stephen and friends, looking at the posters of the
production.

   About 60,000 government workers
ended a five-day strike on Monday after receiving assurances that
Congress would consider their demands .
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said the return to work may have
prevented a coup.
   ``We passed the test and now it's a question of erasing the
slate and starting over,'' Azcona Hoyo told a news conference.
   ``If there is no understanding and no dialogue, such
abnormalities (as the strike) end in a violent confrontation or a
coup.''
   The workers, members of the National Association of Public
Employees, struck last Wednesday and the armed forces occupied
public buildings until the strike ended Monday morning.
   The strikers demanded paid vacations, improved job security,
civil service reforms and varying pay increases. Their salary now
averages $500 a month.
   No settlement was reached. Azcona Hoyo said he promised no
retaliation would be made against strikers or strike leaders.
   The president said he appointed a Cabinet committee to determine
how the nation of 5 million could pay union demands that the
government estimated could cost $150 million a year. Congress will
take up the issue in December.
   Association leader Carlos Obdulio Chevez said that if the
demands are not met, ``we will go on strike again, because the
suspension of this strike does not mean we are giving up our
demands.''
   Chevez praised Azcona Hoyo, saying the president ``was always
ready to have a dialogue with us.''

   A federal judge on Monday blocked a state law
that would have banned the three major television networks from
conducting exit polls just outside voting places to predict winners
on election night.
   U.S. District Judge David Doty, saying the law is likely to be
found unconstitutional, issued a preliminary injunction against its
enforcement.
   The 1984 law prohibits voters from being asked how they voted
within 100 feet of the polling place. Nearly half the states have
some limits on exit polling, in part because of fears that voter
turnout will be hampered by early predictions of results.
   The networks targeted Minnesota along with six other states
where they successfully challenged restrictions they considered so
stringent they would effectively ban exit polls.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York lawyer representing CBS, ABC and NBC,
had argued that the Minnesota law violates free speech and would
prevent family members from asking each other how they voted if
they were within the zoned area.
   ``We're delighted,'' Abrams said of Doty's ruling. ``It's a
First Amendment right that the public have that information.
   ``If the voter doesn't want to answer questions he doesn't have
to, but if th voter is willing to answer the questions, he should
be able to be a part of the process.''
   Doty said that one of the principal concerns of the First
Amendment is the free discussion of governmental affairs. He also
said the First Amendment protects the news media's right to gather
information.
   ``Thus, exit polling, which involves gathering and disseminating
information on governmental affairs, is protected by the free
speech clause of the First Amendment,'' Doty wrote.
   Peter Ackerberg, a special assistant state attorney general, had
argued that the Minnesota law was passed to preserve the sanctity
of the polling place, to prevent harassment of voters, to prevent
congestion and confusion around the polling place, and to encourage
voter participation.
   Ackerberg said he would not comment on Doty's ruling until he
sees it Tuesday.
   Doty said legislators who wrote the law were primarily concerned
with ``alleviating the threat that people might be discouraged from
voting if a projection indicates that a particular outcome of an
election is almost a certainty.''
   ``Such a purpose is not a sufficient basis for restricting
otherwise constitutionally protected speech,'' Doty wrote.
   Abrams said the networks have successfully fought similar exit
polling restrictions in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Montana,
Washington and Wyoming.
   Exit polling became controversial in 1980 when it became clear
after polls closed in the East that Ronald Reagan would defeat
President Jimmy Carter by a landslide. Many Westerners were still
voting when the networks declared Reagan the winner.
   The three networks say this year they will project winners of
the presidential race state-by-state as polls close, but will
refrain from declaring a winner overall until after voters on the
West Coast cast their ballots.
   State Rep. Randy Kelly, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee and a proponent of the law, said the Legislature is not
likely to repeal the exit poll law unless courts declare it
unconstitutional.
   Kelly said exit polls ``might greatly reduce the voting of
people in a democracy.''
   Abrams said the networks may try to obtain a permanent
injunction against the Minnesota law after the election. But he
said the next legal step by the networks will hinge on whether
Minnesota officials ``persist in opposing our efforts'' to conduct
exit polls.

   Cardinal Thomas B. Cooray, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Colombo, Sri Lanka, for 29 years until his
retirement in 1976, has died, the Vatican announced Monday. He was
86.
   Cooray died Saturday night in Tewatte Ragama, the Vatican said.
It did not give a cause of death.
   He was archbishop of Colombo from July 26, 1947, until his
retirement on Sept. 2, 1976. Cooray was installed as a cardinal by
Pope Paul VI on Feb. 22, 1965.
   His death leaves 156 members of the College of Cardinals.
   While archbishop, ``Cooray favored a respectful dialogue with
the Buddhists and with other Christians,'' the Vatican said.
``During the years of suppression or limitation of religious
freedom, Cooray constantly affirmed the spirituality of his own
mission and the loyalty of the Roman Catholics (to the
government).''
   Services will be held Thursday.

   The busy presidential campaign helped
persuade the government Monday to settle a false arrest lawsuit
accusing Secret Service agents of beating a bystander during a 1984
raid on counterfeiters, attorneys said.
   The government, which needs the services during the campaign
season of agents who might have had to testify, agreed to pay
Edward Scala of Jersey City $2,500, but admitted no wrongdoing for
the Sept. 8, 1984, incident. Scala had sued for $1 million in
damages.
   ``They're busy,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey D. Smith said
of the agents who would have had to testify and prepare for a
trial. ``This is big crunch time,'' he said, referring to the
comings and goings of the candidates.
   The Secret Service, a branch of the U.S. Treasury Department,
has the duty of protecting political figures and investigating
counterfeiting.
   Scala charged that when agents burst into his Jersey City
building to raid a counterfeiting ring, they handcuffed him, beat
him and dragged him through the hallway and caused him ``severe and
permanent injuries,'' said his lawsuit, which was filed 18 months
later.
   The agents struck Scala in the head, neck and groin, according
to the complaint.
   They also entered his apartment without a proper search warrant,
it said.
   The Treasury Department in November 1985 denied an
administrative settlement, so he went to federal court for damages
and legal costs.
   Smith said Scala was never struck and was only detained after
running away from the agents. He was handcuffed for 30 seconds and
held for under five minutes until agents were told that Scala was a
resident of the building, the attorney said.
   An agent chased Scala into his apartment on the basis of a broad
search warrant, Smith added.
   During the raid, Scala ``was kind of rubbernecking, you might
say,'' Smith said.
   Smith said the afternoon raid netted $7.5 million in counterfeit
currency, the largest such seizure at the time in New Jersey. The
bogus bills were mostly in denominations of $10 and $20. Five
people were arrested and convicted or pleaded guilty, he said.
   Scala, in his 50s, could not be reached for comment. His home
telphone number is not published. His attorney, John Schwartz,
declined to comment on the settlement. He said his client was
unemployed.
   The suit did not specify the nature of Scala's injuries.

   Michael Dukakis boasted about his liberal background and
challenged rival George Bush to an election eve debate while the
Republican nominee, wary of a tightening presidential race, vowed a
tough fight in the campaign's waning days. With eight days left
until Election Day, an enthusiastic Dukakis campaigned by train
Sunday through California's Central Valley, where he added a new
twist to his populist appeal.
   ``We need a president in the tradition, yes, the liberal
tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and John Kennedy,''
the Democratic nominee told voters at stops from Bakersfield to
Stockton.
   Questioned by reporters about his decision to embrace the
``L-word,'' a label he has shunned for months, Dukakis said he
comes from the liberal tradition of ``presidents who were on the

of Kraft by Philip Morris that would create the world's biggest

   The proposed merger announced Sunday would be the biggest ever
between two non-oil U.S. companies and, if successful, would end a

   The Reagan administration is expected to
respond to an appeal from South Korea early this week by announcing
an easing of diplomatic and trade restrictions against North Korea,
according to U.S. officials.
   The moves are a complement to efforts by South Korean President
Roh Tae Woo, who has called for a north-south summit meeting and a
resumption of trade between the two Koreas as part of an attempt to
ease tensions on the peninsula.
   Roh met with President Reagan 10 days ago and suggested the
United States take some modest steps in coordination with South
Korea's own moves. Although modest, the gestures planned by the
administration are believed to be the most extensive the United
States has adopted toward the communist north since the Korean
armistice was signed 35 years ago.

from commercial banks.
   The nation's 3,048 savings institutions lost $7.5 billion in the
first six months of this year and losses almost surely will top
last year's post-Depression record of $7.8 billion.
   An estimated 4,050 delegates and spouses to the U.S. League of

1989, when Congress likely will make decisions affecting the

   If the marbled murrelet turns out to be an
endangered bird, it may endanger loggers' plans to take timber from
some of the oldest forests in North America.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, in a little-noticed decision
published in the Federal Register, agreed to consider listing the
marbled murrelet as an endangered species. The agency found that a
National Audubon Society petition for listing the bird ``presented
substantial information indicating that the requested action may be
warranted.''
   Not much is known about the marbled murrelet, a robin-sized
seabird that seems to swim better than it walks or flies. But
scientists are convinced the bird nests almost exclusively in the
old-growth timber that towers over the coastal regions of the
Northwest _ some of the oldest forests in North America.

   The film ratings system, which at its inception
gave a G to ``Dracula Has Risen From the Grave,'' turns 20 years
old Tuesday to mixed reviews from Hollywood insiders and outsiders.
   To groups denouncing what they see as a penchant by the film
industry for sex, violence and drugs, the Motion Picture
Association of America's ratings system is inadequate. To many
filmmakers, an X rating, or even a family-oriented G, means
box-office poison, and obtaining a PG-13 or an R has become
imperative, the equivalent of a mass-marketing seal of approval.
   To Gene Siskel, film critic for the Chicago Tribune, ``The
R-rated category is now so widespread, and covers so many emotions
and physical acts that I don't know how valuable it is to parents.''

   Oscar campaigns begin earlier every year, and
already the guns of autumn are firing for such potential nominees
as Tom Hanks, Jodie Foster, Sigourney Weaver and Don Ameche.
   The studios and publicity offices are readying trade paper ads
to offer films and performances ``for your consideration.'' The ads
will feature reviewers' comments that a certain actor's work is
deserving of Academy Award recognition. The champ in that
department is Tom Hanks.
   The affable Hanks has been the subject of the biggest publicity
blitz since last year's blast for Cher, who ended up with the
best-actress Oscar for ``Moonstruck.''
   First with ``Big'' and then with ``Punchline,'' Hanks has been
the recipient of glowing reviews, many of which mentioned his Oscar
chances.
   A Hanks nomination seems certain, but for which movie? If
Academy voters judge by financial success, they might choose his
role in ``Big'' as the youngster who is transformed overnight into
a 30-year-old. But they might consider his troubled comic in
``Punchline'' more of a challenge.
   Some observers believe Weaver is overdue for an Oscar, and she
is likely to be nominated for her role as the obsessed naturalist
Dian Fossey in ``Gorillas in the Mist.'' If the Academy had an
award for bravery, she would certainly win it for working
intimately with the wild gorillas.
   Two recent performances have drawn Academy predictions from many
reviewers: Jodie Foster's rape victim in ``The Accused''; Don
Ameche's innocent among the Mafia in ``Things Change.''
   Unlike 1987, when most of the Academy hopefuls were clumped in
the final weeks, this time an impressive array of films and
performances has been spread out over the year. Although more
potential nominees will appear in November and December, it's
possible to offer a survey of possibilities thus far.
   As with last year, the strongest race appears to be among the
female stars. Aside from Weaver and Foster, other performances
which have attracted strong support include: Shirley MacLaine,
``Madame Sousatzka''; Barbara Hershey, ``A World Apart''; Meryl
Streep, ``A Cry in the Dark''; Whoopi Goldberg, ``Clara's Heart'';
Sally Field, ``Punchline''; Gene Rowlands, ``Another Woman.''
   Joining Hanks and Ameche as possibilities for best actor: Forest
Whitaker, ``Bird''; Sam Neill, ``A Cry in the Dark''; Ben Kingsley,
``Pascali's Island''; Willem Dafoe, ``The Last Temptation of
Christ''; Edward James Olmos, ``Stand and Deliver''; Kevin Costner,
``Bull Durham.''
   However, so far no runaway has been sighted for best picture of
1988. Here are some possibles: ``Big''; ``Gorillas in the Mist'';
``Punchline''; ``A Cry in the Dark''; ``Bull Durham''; ``Madame
Sousatzka.''
   The Oscar race will undoubtedly change as new entries reach the
marketplace. The most promising works include:
   _ ``Rainman,'' with Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise.
   _ ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' starring Harvey Fierstein in the film
version of his hit play, with Anne Bancroft and Matthew Broderick.
   _ ``Mississippi Burning,'' starring Gene Hackman and Willem
Dafoe.
   _ ``Talk Radio,'' with Ellen Green and Alec Baldwin.
   _ ``The Accidental Tourist,'' co-starring William Hurt and
Kathleen Turner.
   _ ``Beaches,'' with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.
   _ ``Working Girl,'' starring Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and
Sigourney Weaver.
   The 61st Annual Academy Awards will arrive early next year _
March 29. For the second year the ceremonies will be held at the
Shrine Auditorium, and city authorities have promised more control
over the traffic. Allan Carr is producing the show, and Marvin
Hamlisch has been announced as musical director.

   Parishioners found moistened sponges in the
holy water fonts recently at the Modena's 12th century Roman
Catholic cathedral. Archbishop Santo Quadri apologized, explaining
that the fonts had to be drained to stop drug addicts from using
them to rinse their needles.
   Drug addiction, said the archbishop, ``is one of the heaviest

   In the first nine months of this year, 500 deaths in the country
have been attributed to heroin overdoses _ more than all of 1987.
   Former Premier Bettino Craxi said Mafia-controlled drug
smuggling and killings will soon reach ``South American
proportions'' in Italy and called for life sentences for pushers.
   Police seizures of heroin have risen from 11,440 ounces in 1987
to more than 14,080 ounces so far this year. The use of cocaine,
once reserved for the wealthy, is booming, with police seizing more
than 17,600 ounces this year, compared to 14,472 ounces in all of
last year.
   Drug pushers and users have been growing younger every year. A
common urban sight has been police and sniffer dogs inspecting
students' bags at the gates of high schools. On the first day of
school in September, 113 drug peddlers were picked up across the
country while lurking outside school buildings.
   The drug explosion has also stoked the spread of AIDS, which can
be transmitted through dirty needles, turning Italy into the second
worst affected country in Europe behind France.
   According to the World Health Organization, most of Italy's
2,233 AIDS victims have been heroin addicts.
   The spread of drugs has been most spectacular in the rich north,
home of high-tech companies, sleek factories and many of Italy's
estimated 300,000 heroin addicts.
   The communist municipal government in Modena, where Ferrari
racing cars are made, has started subsidizing rehabilitation
clinics and methadone substitution programs. Opera star Luciano
Pavarotti, a city native, has performed free for anti-drug benefits.
   In the neighboring Lombardy region, which accounts for nearly
one quarter of the heroin deaths, the city of Milan has put drugs
just behind motor vehicle traffic as a top municipal priority. City
workers have been detached to scoop up 3,000 to 4,000 discarded
syringes daily from streets and parks. In Rome, a similar municipal
service has collected close to half a million in the past year.
   Because of the Sicilian Mafia and the Camorra crime organization
in Naples, Italy is considered one of the main international
shipping points for heroin to the United States and Europe.
   For years, the gangs largely refrained from selling on their
home turf out of a sense of honor. But more and more drugs are
being distributed at home because of a glut in other markets,
according to the Italian Interior Ministry.
   Italy's current drug law was passed in the wake of the more
lenient atmosphere of the 1970s. It penalizes peddling while
allowing possession of ``modest quantities.''
   Sociologist Saverio Vertone charges that the law has turned
every buyer into a potential pusher.
   ``Parliament followed the prevailing winds at the time,'' said
Vertone. ``Even LSD was considered OK for personal consumption.''
   Vertone has joined the chorus of Italians who are demanding
tougher measures in the drug war. Pushers now face a maximum term
of 30 years.
   The Rev. Mario Picchi, a Catholic priest who runs a string of
rehabilitation centers, believes users should not be placed in the
same category as pushers.
   ``Drug addicts need assistance,'' he said. ``You can't punish an
alcoholic just because he's had a drink. The dealers of death, on
the other hand, must face tougher sentences.''
   One of Picchi's proposals would provide for fines for
recreational drug users.

   The backdrops were Gorky Park, Lenin's tomb
and Red Square when ABC's ``Head of the Class'' taped an episode in
the Soviet Union, but the focus _ at least briefly _ was on cast
member Robin Givens and hubby Mike Tyson, the boxing champ.
   ``The Russians knew who Mike was. No one knew who we were,''
said actor-comedian Dan Frischman. ``The waiters were all over him,
bringing caviar, flowers and vodka. Kids showed up with boxing
gloves. At dinner one night, Mike said it was cold. The waiter told
him, `Dress warm.'''
   For himself, Frischman said he was delighted by the opportunity
to meet face-to-face with Russian youngsters.
   ``It was important that we got to talk to the students,'' said
Frischman, who plays Arvid Engen, the nerdy mathematics whiz on the
show. ``They're highly educated. They know more about America than
we know about Russia.
   ``Their education still includes a lot of our negative aspect,
such as strikes and the homeless, but they seem envious of our
freedom. They said they hoped to have a people's democracy within
the communist system.''
   The results of the almost two-week Russian visit, made in
September, will be shown in a special one-hour episode of ``Head of
the Class'' on Wednesday.
   It was the first time an episode from a regular series has been
made in the Soviet Union.
   ``It started last year when we had a story about our class
competing against a Russian academic team,'' said Frischman.
   Rich Eustis and Michael Elias, the executive producers and
creators, came up with the idea of going to the Soviet Union for a
re-match. In the show, Howard Hesseman plays the teacher of a class
of young geniuses at Manhattan's Millard Fillmore High School.
   One part of the story calls for Arvid and Dennis (Dan Schneider)
to get lost just before the competition.
   ``We're trying to get back and we split up on the Metro subway.
The Metro stops are really beautiful. Some have chandeliers, some
have cathedral ceilings,'' said Frischman.
   ``It was a chance to experience another culture completely
different from our own. We had a chance to work with the Soviets
and experience the same kind of problems they experience. I got to
talk to a lot of young people, who are much more optimistic about
their future than their elders. I did some stand-up comedy at
Moscow University and saw that humor is a universal language. It
was good to know my act works in Moscow.''
   Givens and Tyson have since filed for divorce, but the Moscow
trip was apparently a contented time.
   ``I had trouble believing all the headlines about marital
problems,'' Frischman said. ``What I saw was a happy couple. Mike
was very polite. No one was jealous of all the publicity they got.
   ``But if the marriage had worked out, I was considering getting
married myself. I was thinking of Mount Fiji, the world's women
wrestling champion.
   Frischman was in his dressing room outside Stage 5 at the
Burbank Studios, where ``Head of the Class'' is taped before an
audience. The show scheduled to tape that night featured his
character in a story in which Arvid's father comes to the school.
   ``An audience is necessary for me being a comedian at heart,''
said Frischman. ``Having a crowd to play to is half the fun. But I
find the audience reacts better to Arvid if I don't go out as
myself. They like to see Arvid.
   ``My standup is much different. I talk about Dan Frischman and
my life experiences. My romantic trials and heroic deeds.''
   Frischman is also writing an ABC Afterschool Special that he
hopes to star in.

<HEAD>Sweden Toughens Requirements for Soviet Asylum Seekers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden has toughened its requirements
for granting asylum to Soviet defectors, acting on the Kremlin's
word that the human rights climate is improving.
   So far as is known, the Swedes are the first in Western Europe
to modify their refugee policy to adjust for glasnost, Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   The Swedish Immigration Board has issued deportation orders
against 10 Soviets asking to stay. The board held that they did not
qualify as political refugees and that the risk has diminished they
will be punished if they return home.
   Until last spring, asylum requests were routinely granted, on
the assumption that anyone who was sent back could be prosecuted
for anti-Soviet behavior.
   But now ``the legal environment has changed'' in the Soviet
Union, said Bjorn Westin, an Immigration Board official, and Sweden
now will judge each case on its merits.
   All 10 of the Soviets ordered deported have appealed and are
still in Sweden. While the 10 were turned down the Immigration
Board approved about 80 other applications, officials said.
   Westin said those who were refused ``are not refugees. We don't
turn away refugees.''
   He added that the board, after checking each case with the
Swedish embassy in Moscow, was convinced that none would face
reprisals.
   ``If that had been the case, we wouldn't turn them back.''
   Sweden, which has one of the most liberal refugee policies in
Europe, gets more requests for asylum from Soviets than any other
country on the continent.
   Defectors often leave the Soviet Union with legal visas, then
refuse to go back when their visas expire. Others reach the West
after dramatic escapes. Last year a farm hand flew a crop duster
airplane across the Baltic Sea and crashed near Sweden's Gotland
island.
   Among 18,000 or so people granted asylum in Sweden last year, 73
came from the Soviet Union, while other countries in Western Europe
accepted fewer than 10 Soviets each.
   The number of Soviets asking to stay in Sweden was expected to
reach 120 by the end of this year, partly because Soviet
authorities were allowing more people to travel abroad and were
less careful to make sure they intended to come back, officials
said.
   Officials questioned in Spain, Greece, Italy, Denmark and
Switzerland said the rules for Soviet citizens are no different
from for any other country and have not changed in view of glasnost.
   ``Of course overall developments in the Soviet Union play a
role, but we wouldn't go so far as to say that due to glasnost and
perestroika (restructuring) the problem has been solved,'' said
Heinz Schoeni, spokesman for Switzerland's refugee commissioner in
Geneva.
   Finland, which is the only non-communist country to share a long
land border with the Soviet Union and has a ``friendship pact''
with the Kremlin, has handled the question of Soviet defectors
delicately and usually in secret. Many reportedly have been turned
away or quietly told to take the next ferry to Sweden.
   Sweden's decision to scrutinize Soviet asylum seekers more
carefully has caused consternation among Soviet emigres, who say
they have less faith than the Swedish government in Soviet pledges
of human rights reforms.
   Ulo Ignatz, editor of an Estonian-language newspaper published
in Stockholm, said that those who return to the Soviet Union may
not be imprisoned as before but may find their careers blocked or
face other forms of harassment.
   ``The legislation has not been changed,'' Juris Kaza, a
Stockholm-based freelance journalist specializing in the Baltic
States, said of the Soviet pledges on human rights.
   ``The statute against anti-Soviet activity is still on the
books. It's an arbitrary decision not to prosecute,'' he said.
   Sweden's move also caught human rights groups by surprise.
   ``It's quite a new problem for us,'' said Jan Bolling, of the
Swedish branch of the London-based Amnesty International.
   ``We can't say that from our point of view asylum seekers face
less of a risk today. We have no such information.''

<HEAD>Clandestine Group Steps Up Attacks on English Property in Wales</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A clandestine group calling itself the
Sons of Glendower has stepped up a 9-year-old arson campaign
against English-owned property in Wales, increasing fears that the
attacks will begin to claim lives.
   The group chooses violence to fight what many Welsh oppose _ the
increased immigration of the English into Wales.
   Celtic Wales has been united with Saxon England for 452 years,
but nationalism remains a strong undercurrent in Wales, and the
English influx is widely blamed for diluting the Welsh language and
culture and inflating house prices beyond reach of the local people.
   Such themes are not confined to Wales. Regional nationalism is a
flourishing, often divisive force in this United Kingdom of
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, not to mention
subdivisions like Cornwall and the Isle of Man, where outsiders'
vacation homes are also a target of local nationalists.
   But in this western, coastal region of Britain, the Welsh
extremists have struck more frequently in recent months and have
pushed across the border to burn down property in England.
   The arsonists, who have their supporters but are shunned by the
nationalist mainstream, also have expanded their targets from
mostly vacation homes to commercial property like real estate
offices, and they have begun using more sophisticated incendiary
time-bombs.
   Nobody expects the attacks to escalate into a conflict like
Northern Ireland's, which has killed about 2,700 people in the past
20 years. But the time-bombs, which could go off at the wrong time
or in the wrong hands, are causing serious concern.
   ``We have been so concerned about this change in tactics,'' said
Inspector John Hughes-Jones at the Colwyn Bay headquarters of the
North Wales police. ``It is a miracle that nobody has been
seriously injured or killed. With the recent escalation, the odds
of that happening are shortening all the time.''
   Recent weeks have seen at least 11 attacks on real estate
offices, shops and a vacation home. Eight of those came on one
weekend in early October over a widespread area of western England.
   Fears also are growing that the campaign might encourage old
prejudices and discourage job-creating inward investment _ problems
Northern Ireland knows well.
   ``Obviously, anything of that sort would not exactly advertise
the place,'' said Roger Mansfield, director of the University of
Wales' Cardiff Business School. ``It has the potential of
developing into a major problem.''
   Since 1979, 19 men have been convicted of arson and damage
offenses, police say, but the force has made no arrests in three
years, and it is being criticized for failing to unmask the Sons of
Glendower.
   Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party which has three seats
in the 650-member House of Commons, strongly opposes the violent
campaign. Its president, Dafydd Elis Thomas, has called the police
``most ineffective'' and urged the government to apply pressure for
better results.
   The police say they lack evidence partly because the public is
uncooperative.
   ``It's quite a big percentage who (a) obviously know something
but don't want to tell us, or (b) those who know something that
they don't know would help us,'' Hughes-Jones said.
   Wales, brought under English rule by King Edward I in 1282 and
united with England in 1536, has a long history of protest against
its conquerors. In the 1960s, for example, a group called the Free
Welsh Army waged a violent anti-English campaign.
   The Welsh Language Society for years has waged non-violent
protest against English immigration, staging sit-ins in real estate
offices and glueing their locks.
   Non-violent nationalists support measures such as limiting
property sales to English newcomers and imposing higher taxes on
second homes.
   The Sons of Glendower, or Meibion Glyndwyr, take their name from
Owen Glendower, a 15th-century Welsh rebel leader.
   The group is believed to be responsible for most of the 150
arson incidents, counted primarily in rural, picturesque north
Wales since the first attack, on a cottage in Mynydd Nefyn Dec. 13,
1979, police said.
   The group, which initially broke into empty homes and built
simple fires, has made erratic phone calls and delivered letters
claiming responsibity over the years.
   ``The target now (sic) the colonists and the capitalists,'' said
a letter delivered to HTV, the Welsh television station, after
recent attacks on a tackle shop and canoe gear store in Wales.
``They are the enemies of the people. Their free markets are
killing Wales. We demand justice.''
   It was signed Rhys Gethin, who was a lieutenant of Owen
Glendower, police said.
   The extremists' most prominent public supporter is the Welsh
poet R.S. Thomas, a retired minister, who earlier this year
described them as the only true defenders of Welsh language and
culture.
   Owain Williams, a founding member of a new nationalist movement
called Y Cyfamodwyr, or the Covenanters, doesn't go that far, but
says he won't condemn Thomas' stance because ``the situation is
desperate. It needs desperate measures.''
   Williams added: ``They are expected to lie down and take it as a
streamroller crushes them west into the sea. We are becoming the
dispossessed in our own land. This is our last foothold.''
   The British government's Welsh Office says it has no statistics
showing how many of Wales' 2.8 million people are English, but
nationalists say their numbers are multiplying significantly.
   The English are believed to comprise less than 20 percent of
Wales' population but reliable statistics on their numbers and the
migration trend are hard to come by because the British are not
required to register their English or other nationality.
   But Welsh nationalists say the English immigrants' numbers are
multiplying significantly.
   Middle-class English people are taking advantage of a property
boom in southeast England to sell high at home and buy cheaper
homes in Wales, which many believe to be an idyllic spot for
raising a family, as well as for retirement, weekends and vacations.
   A recent revival of the Welsh economy has made it easier for the
English to find jobs in Wales, and many of those who don't find
local employment choose to commute. Some go as far as London, which
is about 200 miles to the southeast, or a train ride of about four
hours from this coastal resort.
   Meanwhile, the percentage of people speaking Welsh, which is
taught in schools and is highly visible on the nation's bilingual
signs, has declined to 64 percent in the Welsh-speaking areas this
year from 71.3 percent in 1981, a recent survey for HTV indicated.
   The survey also showed that 57 percent of the 1,000 people
questioned in west and north Wales supported the aims of the Sons
of Glendower, although only 6 percent endorsed the arson campaign.

<HEAD>Ayn Rand Epic Makes It to American Cinema 46 Years Late</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an adventure with almost as many twists and
plot turns as the movie itself, Ayn Rand's ``We the Living'' is
about to make it to American theaters. The 46-year-old film was
thought to have been destroyed by Mussolini.
   ``We The Living'' was made in war-time Italy in 1942, and was
based on the novel of the same name by Ayn Rand, whose
``objectivism'' philosphy in such works as ``The Fountainhead'' and
``Atlas Shrugged'' made her a cult figure in the 1970s.
   The movie has caused a stir over the years, and has repeatedly
won critical acclaim, from the Venice Festival of 1942 to the
Fourth Annual Boston Film Festival last month.
   A surface indictment of communism, the lushly photographed,
romantic saga is set in Russia as the tidal wave of revolution
boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in
the way people lived and loved and survived.
   Rossano Brazzi co-stars as a tubercular aristocat who can't get
a job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of
fashion. He said he made arrangements for Rand to get her first
look at the film when he met her in Hollywood after the war.
However, he didn't think Italy's fascist government had ordered the
movie to be destroyed.
   It went out of circulation because the ``natural life of the
film was over,'' Brazzi said in a telephone interview from his home
in Rome.
   But Massimo Ferrara-Santamaria, a Rome lawyer who was general
manager of the studio where the movie was made, said he was called
before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and
copies of the film, and was stripped of his position at the studio
and as lecturer at Italian universities for his role in making the
movie.
   ``In the tragic Italian war situation, the film was called by
the public `Noi Morti' (`We the Dead'),'' he said in an interview,
adding that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels banned the
film in Germany after Ferrara personally showed it at Goebbels'
Berlin home in October 1942.
   ``At the end of the screening, Goebbels told me that the
Russians were habitually presented to the German public in a much
more negative way than in this picture, and therefore it was no
good for Germany,'' he said.
   Erika and Henry Mark Holzer, the movie's producers, were Rand's
lawyers in the 1960s. Mrs. Holzer said the author believed the
banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the
two attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives. It
finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with ``a
bunch of Italian films for sale.''
   They rode through the bumpy back streets of Rome with a load of
potentially explosive nitrate-treated film in the back of an old
truck, including the negative for ``We the Living.'' They had the
movie transferred to ``safety film'' before flying it back to New
York.
   Mrs. Holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative,
which Ferrara had hidden.
   Ferrara and others say Italy's Ministry of Culture ordered the
film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds
that though the message might purport to be anti-communist, it
could also be taken as anti-totalitarian _ a strong statement for
individualism, regardless of political coloration.
   The fascists didn't want that kind of propaganda message playing
on the homefront with Italy's Axis troops stretched from North
Africa to Stalingrad, and the Allies storming the beaches of Sicily.
   Rand had a hard-line, libertarian philosophy. It was best
exemplified by Gary Cooper in the ``Fountainhead,'' who played an
architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be
desecrated by the whims of popularism.
   Mrs. Holzer said Rand liked the film version of ``We the
Living'' even more than ``The Fountainhead,'' although the author
had written the latter's screenplay herself and was not asked for
permission for the Italian film.
   Brazzi said it was a so-called war movie: ``We'll worry after
the war about paying for it.'' He said Rand eventually did receive
compensation from Scalera, the producing studio.
   Mrs. Holzer said that once she and her husband recovered an
original nitrate negative, Rand went through the film frame by
frame to identify exactly how she wanted it edited. The Italian
version was made in two parts and ran over 4{ hours. The project
was set aside when Rand had other commitments, and was not picked
up until after the author's death in 1982. The film was restored by
Duncan Scott.
   The epic was shot entirely on indoor, elaborately built Italian
war-time sets recreating Russian country scenes, trains, ships and
Petrograd.
   ``I'm told almost the entire White Russian community in Italy
was used as extras,'' Mrs. Holzer said.
   The new version, distributed by Angelika Films, is under three
hours, and is set for release Nov. 5 in Boston, Nov. 11 in Los
Angeles and Nov. 25 in New York. It will play to other major U.S.
markets before January.
   The film also stars a young and radiant Alida Valli, the female
lead in the 1949 British thriller, ``The Third Man''; and Fosco
Giachetti, who was the No. 1 box-office draw in Italy when the
movie was made, according to its producers.
   ``We the Living'' has a bit of soap opera in it: Beautiful Kira
loves Leo, the tubercular aristocat; Andrei of the dreaded secret
police loves Kira because she has the courage to be independent and
defiant of the new order.
   But underneath the suds is a hard reality: Kira forsakes her
love when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line. Andrei
kills himself when he realizes first that Kira used him to get Leo
a spot in a sanitarium, and that his adored party leaves no freedom
for individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or
saint.
   Kira goes forward, wiser but unbowed, a testimony to the strong
and the living, and the survival of the toughest.
   Rand, who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered
capitalism and ``rational selfishness,'' held individual freedom as
the highest ideal. She said alturism was weakness, and blamed it
for much of the world's woes. But she also attacked libertarians of
the right who often identified with her philosophy.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They go through bizarre rituals that caricature
everyday behavior. They become puppets of a relentless compulsion
and lose the capacity to trust their senses. The disorder, not as
rare as one would think, has long been intractable, but now
breakthroughs in drug and behavior therapy bring new hope to those
so strangely afflicted. The first of two stories.

   Every morning for 20 years, April rose before dawn. While her
family slept, April scrubbed: sinks, toilets, floors, doorknobs, an
ever-growing list. Sometimes she ran through it twice.
   On bad days, she'd be halfway to work before realizing she'd
forgotten something at home. ``Once I went out, I was
contaminated,'' she says. ``Going back in meant I had to shower,
change clothes and clean house all over again.''
   On Joe's worst days, he spent hours darting about his apartment
in panic. Was the door locked? Stove off? Window closed? Some days,
he'd check for hours and still not be sure.
   Mike had to count: the steps he took, the coins in his pocket,
the times he chewed every bite. Though not superstitious, ``I was
counting to make sure I didn't do anything 13 times,'' he says.
``If I did, I felt my father would die of a heart attack.''
   April, Joe and Mike suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder,
for centuries one of the most baffling and intractable mental
illnesses. Throughout history, OCD sufferers from Samuel Johnson to
Howard Hughes have been slaves to the intrusive, irrational
thoughts known as obsessions, and the senseless, repetitive
rituals, or compulsions, that accompany them.
   Now, breakthroughs in drug treatment and behavior therapy are
bringing new hope to OCD victims. The discoveries coincide with
mounting evidence of a link between OCD and other neurological
illnesses and movement disorders, such as some forms of epilepsy,
Parkinson's Disease, and Tourette's Syndrome.
   Along with generating wide medical interest, the developments
are helping ease the stigma long felt by OCD victims, who are
seeking help in unprecedented numbers. As a result, researchers
have concluded that the illness, once considered rare, is actually
fairly common.
   ``Whether you know it or not,'' says one expert, ``you do know
someone with this disease.''
   Chances are, you don't know it. OCD usually strikes healthy,
sane people who are adept at hiding their symptoms from spouses,
employers and friends. That they're able to do it is remarkable,
given the debilitating nature of the illness:
   _ A respected accountant cannot mail a letter without tearing it
open to make sure his daughter isn't sealed inside.
   _ A skilled engineer can't drive to work without retracing his
route over and over for fear he ran over a pedestrian on the way.
   _ A young housewife turns her basement into a repository for
everything from used Kitty Litter to carpet lint, for reasons she's
at a loss to explain.
   Some conceal their behavior by distancing themselves emotionally
and physically. Compared to the general public, people with OCD are
nearly twice as likely not to marry and more likely to divorce if
they do.
   Revised estimates now hold that the so-called ``doubting
disease'' affects roughly 2 percent of the population, between 4
million and 6 million people in the United States alone.
   The majority of them are as aware _ and as ashamed _ of their
aberrant behavior as they are powerless to stop it.
   ``Telling a person to stop washing or stop checking is like
telling the average person to stop breathing,'' says Jenny, a wife
and mother who says OCD stole 15 years of her life. Like others who
agreed to discuss their illness, she asked that her last name not
be used.
   Jenny's illness began with a cancer obsession that sent her
scurrying from doctor to doctor. ``I began having hysterical
reactions, like worrying so much about getting a bump on my tongue
that I would actually get a bump on my tongue.''
   Abruptly, those fears vanished, replaced by something worse:
relentless, incapacitating fears of losing control and stabbing her
children. ``I had my suicide all planned,'' Jenny says. ``I was
going to lock myself in the garage and turn on my car.''
   Instead, Jenny sought treatment at a Yale University clinic.
Like an estimated two-thirds of the OCD patients who undergo the
new behavior therapy or drug treatment, she got better.
   Dr. Wayne K. Goodman is chief of the Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder Clinic at Yale. In three years of treating OCD, ``I have
seen it go away, although most people are not totally free of
symptoms. After therapy the obsessions are still there. The
difference is they no longer have to perform the compulsions.''
   Today, Jenny estimates her illness is with her 2 percent of the
time. She keeps it at bay with a small maintenance dose of an
anti-depressant. When they do surface, she says, ``the thoughts are
manageable and easily discarded.''
   Jenny now works full-time, attends graduate school, and helps
run the North Haven, Conn.-based OCD Foundation, an education,
information and referral service she founded with a small group of
patients.
   Jenny's obsessions _ fear of disease and fear of harming others
_ are among the most common, as are fear of death, dirt or germs;
of harming oneself; of uttering obscenities or insults; of
discarding something of great value.
   Others include perverse sexual or violent images, blasphemous
thoughts, exaggerated fears of chemical or environmental
contamination.
   Compulsions often include ritualistic washing or cleaning;
counting to certain numbers or avoiding others; continually
checking doors, windows, stoves; hoarding or collecting newspapers,
mail, lint, string; arranging and rearranging drawers, closets,
cupboards.
   Most people with OCD pass through a washing phase at some point
during their illness. While specific obsessions may change over
time, the themes tend to stay the same, Goodman says.
   For many patients, fear of cancer has been replaced by fear of
AIDS, a disease ``made to order for OCD victims,'' one expert says.
   Dr. Judith Rapoport of the National Institute of Mental Health
believes that compulsive behavior _ handwashing, checking or
counting _ actually comes first, followed by the obsession, or
rationale for the behavior.
   ``Man is a rational being. When he finds himself doing something
that looks purposeful _ for example, repeated washing _ his logical
mind has to find a reason,'' she says.

   Obsessions and compulsions can turn up in families previously
untouched by mental illness, but are more likely to cluster in
families with histories of OCD or its frequent companion,
depression.
   Although it affects men and women in equal numbers, children
with OCD are twice as apt to be boys. It often strikes young
adults, but many can recall bouts of obsessive behavior from
childhood, and doctors have spotted it in children as young as 3.
   Obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviors lurk beneath the
surface in nearly everyone. Most people regard neatness and
exactitude as desirable traits. And who hasn't raced home to
double-check an appliance, worried excessively about cancer, or
gotten a tune ``stuck'' in his head?
   No one can pinpoint where meticulousness or rigidity leave off
and illness begins. Still, the experts agree that the periodic
preoccupations of everyday life bear little resemblance to the
relentless, involuntary, all-consuming nature of OCD.
   At their worst, according to Rapoport, the habits of OCD
patients ``become gross caricatures and distortions of useful
everyday behavior.''
   ``My patients fight exhausting battles with invisible germs
daily, even hourly,'' Rapoport writes in ``The Boy Who Couldn't
Stop Washing,'' the first ``popular'' book on OCD, to be published
by E.P. Dutton in January. Rapoport, who's been treating the
illness since 1972, is hoping the book will lure more victims out
of hiding.
   At the core of the doubting disease is ``the inability to be
reassured by the senses,'' Rapoport writes. Somehow the message _
that the house is clean or the doors are locked _ doesn't get
through. ``In one way or another,'' she says, ``every patient with
OCD wants to know how to know.''
   Unlike gambling, overeating or other activities commonly labeled
``compulsive,'' OCD's senseless rituals bring no pleasure. ``I
hated to count,'' says Mike, a young shoe salesman. ``All I ever
wanted was to stop.''
   Like others with the illness, he had no choice but to keep
counting: steps, stairs, shoes, everything.
   Peggy, a secretary in her 30s with flowing brown hair and a
bubbly, outgoing manner, couldn't stop cleaning, a compulsion that
literally popped up overnight.
   ``One weekend when I was 21, I went away with my family,'' she
recalls. ``We walked into a motel room, and everything felt dirty.
When I brought my clothes home the next day, they felt dirty, too.
That was the beginning.''
   Soon, other things bothered Peggy: ``The drugstore. The
hospital. The garbage truck. Anything that had to do with germs or
disease.''
   On a good day, Peggy bathed with bar soap and water. On bad
days, she scrubbed her skin raw with Lysol. ``I stashed Lysol all
over the house, like an alcoholic hides booze. I carried it in my
purse.''
   Over time, Peggy's life became more and more disrupted. Though
lonely, she stayed away from her parents and turned down dates to
protect others from her ``contamination.''
   She did much of her work twice: once at the office and again at
home, where she put on rubber gloves and copied everything over on
``clean'' paper. She bypassed the corner grocery and drove to
distant supermarkets, so as not to contaminate any stores she might
one day need to go back to.
   ``If I'd buy a new outfit, suddenly it would be contaminated.
You either washed it to death or threw it out. I looked like hell.
I couldn't use makeup because I'd contaminate it, and how many
times can you afford to throw away your makeup and buy all new
stuff?''
   April, whose symptoms were similar, became her own plumber and
repairman. Her house was off-limits to all but her husband and
sons; as soon as they got home at night, they were required to use
the shower April had installed in the basement. Showering in the
upstairs bathroom was forbidden.
   Though she had two children and a full-time teaching job, April
couldn't accept help with the housework. ``I would have no way of
knowing what my husband had touched before he picked out our
groceries or whatever.''
   Her sons weren't allowed to go to movies or play in the yard but
were confined to a concrete patio April hosed down each morning. At
school, she couldn't use the bathroom no matter how long her day,
and she retreated to her classroom whenever hallways were crowded.
If a student inadvertently bumped her, it would bother her for a
week.
   ``What was life like? It was hell,'' says April, a neatly
dressed middle-aged woman with short, graying hair, a tense mouth
and reddened eyes that burn with sorrow. ``If you have a cancer or
a heart condition, you can be consoled. With this, you'd be
ostracized. You have to hide it. People would think my judgment is
impaired, even though I'm a good teacher.''
   Her eyes fill and her voice quavers as she recalls her medical
history: ``I've been hospitalized, put on medications, given shock
treatments. The psychiatrists said to restrain me. To take away all
my buckets.''
   Unlike April, who for 20 years never stopped seeking help, Peggy
would still be hiding if a friend hadn't found out and urged her to
get treatment. Otherwise, she might never have known her terrible
secret had a name.
   Many doctors don't know either, often mistaking OCD for
depression or schizophrenia. ``Physicians want to diagnose things
they can treat,'' says Rapoport, who adds that until recently, her
profession had little to offer OCD patients.
   For the time being, most doctors view OCD as a chronic illness
that can be controlled but not cured. But given stepped-up research
by scientists and drug companies around the world, the prognosis is
increasingly hopeful.
   Meanwhile, April waits. After seven years of drug and behavior
treatments, she feels more in control of the illness that has
tormented her for 21 years. But she knows she has yet to break free.
   ``My son wants to come home from college for Thanksgiving and
shower upstairs,'' she says sadly. ``I don't think I'm ready for
that.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's called obsessive-compulsive disorder and is
as unpleasant as it sounds, forcing victims to irrational
repetitions of such mundane tasks as cleaning and washing. It has
been a hard disease for therapists to outwit, but they are
succeeding now through ingenious methods. One is ``flooding''
patients with the fears that drive their compulsions.

   Gathering dog hair, directing home movies and
simulating storms aren't part of a typical therapist's repertoire.
But for Samuel Turner and Deborah Beidel, such things are often all
in a day's work.
   Turner and Beidel of the University of Pittsburgh's Western
Ptute and Clinic are among a growing number of
specialists who are using behavior therapy to tresychiatric Instiat victims
of
obsessive-compulsive disorder, a mysterious illness of senseless,
repetitive rituals driven by runaway doubts.
   People with OCD often engage in excessive cleaning, counting or
checking, to ease intense fears of contamination, disease or other
catastrophe. Much of their energy typically goes into hiding their
illness from others.
   Until recently, OCD, which affects about 2 percent of the
population, was considered among the most treatment-resistant
tments and new therapeutic techniques pioneered in Europe.
   At the Anxiety Disorders Clinic run by the university's medical
school, Turner and Beidel treat OCD patients by ``flooding'' them
with exposure to the very objects, images or events they fear most.
The patients are then prevented from carrying out their compulsions.
   ``The theory behind flooding is that the stimuli that has the
ability to produce anxiety loses that ability through repeated
exposure,'' says Turner, an associate professor of psychiatry.
   For a woman obsessed with contamination caused by animals,
treatment meant enduring a lapful of dog hair, followed by exposure
to a dog. After touching the hair and petting the dog, the patient
was not allowed to carry out her washing compulsions.
   Later, a therapist visited the patient at home, where she had
routinely spent up to 18 hours a day cleaning. Together, patient
and therapist made their way through the house, touching doors,
walls, clothes, towels and sheets.
   Although the sessions made her anxious and upset, the woman
agreed not to clean or wash afterward. The anxiety gradually
diminished, and the need to perform the rituals faded. Finally, the
woman completed her treatment by bringing a friend's cat into her
home and playing with it.
   Just as obsessions and compulsions vary from one patient to
another, so do the treatments Turner and Beidel concoct. One former
patient was obsessed with thunderstorms, to the extent that
darkness or even clouds made him frantic. Because of the
unpredictable nature of real thunderstorms, his therapists
re-created one, using taped sound effects and narration.
   For a woman who served meals in the basement for fear of
contaminating the kitchen, Turner and Beidel made a videotape of
family members ``eating in the kitchen, smashing crackers with
their feet, really messing things up.''
   Turner, who's been treating OCD patients since 1980, says
behavior therapy might reduce a patient's primary symptoms in as
little as three to five months. But often, considerable follow-up
may be needed.
   ``They have to learn their limits for handling stress. We try to
help them recognize what constitutes stresses for them, since the
illness often follows periods of emotional distress,'' Turner says.
   People who have spent years in self-imposed exile may need help
with interpersonal skills. Others may need marital therapy to
repair years of damage done by their illness. In addition, says
Turner, compulsions can take up huge chunks of time. Patients who
get better often need help figuring out how to fill their days more
productively.
   The prognosis may depend on the extent to which the patient
believes his obsession is real. Other factors include ``what else
is wrong in their lives, and how socially adjusted they are,''
Turner says.
   Turner describes the therapy as unorthodox and time-consuming.
``But the response can be very dramatic,'' he says. ``As a rule,
they do get better.''
   Like others, Turner often combines the therapy with drug
treatment. Many patients have shown dramatic improvement in
controlled studies of drugs such as Anafranil and more recently,
Fluoxetine and Fluvoxamine. All are powerful anti-depressants that
affect serotonin, a chemical transmitter within the brain.
Laboratory rats with altered serotonin display ritualistic
``checking'' behavior that resembles compulsions.
   Fluvoxamine and Anafranil, or clomipramine as it's known
generically, are available in the United States on an
investigational basis only. Fluoxetine, (trade name Prozac), is
available for use in depression. Experts point out that it's worth
trying all three, since not all of them work for all patients.
   That the illness responds both to drugs and to therapy is a
puzzle to researchers. But the pieces are beginning to fall into
place.
   Harsh discipline, premature toilet training and unresolved
Oedipal conflicts have long been considered prime suspects in OCD.
   Today, all findings point to a new culprit: biology. Freud
himself had suspected as much.
   Until 30 or 40 years ago, though, the worst cases were treated
with lobotomies and-or hospitalization, replaced over the next 20
years by psychotherapy or psychoanalysis, neither of which did much
good.
   The old theories began to give way during the '70s, when
sophisticated diagnostic tools brought a heightened emphasis on the
link between physiology and mental illness.
   The result has been a wealth of new evidence culled from
laboratory research, drug testing and interviews with OCD victims.
   Among the most compelling arguments is the connection between
OCD and Tourette's Syndrome, a disease marked by involuntary tics,
multiple motor movements and the uncontrollable blurting of sounds,
phrases and in some cases, obscenities. Obsessions and compulsions
occur in one-third of all cases of Tourette's, a disease of the
basal ganglia, the main relay station between sensory information,
learned behavior and motor movement.
   Positron Emission Testing (PET) scans, diagnostic tools that
enable researchers to study the working brain, have revealed
abnormalities in areas of OCD patients' brains that correspond to
areas affected by Tourette's.
   ``If anyone's been skeptical, the relationship between OCD and
Tourette's really settled it,'' says Wayne K. Goodman, chief of the
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Clinic at Yale University.
   One emerging theory holds that OCD may trigger ``fixed action
patterns,'' sequences of primitive behaviors that, while no longer
relevant to 20th-century life, continue to be stored within the
brain. Dr. Judith Rapoport of the National Institute of Mental
Health, a pioneer in OCD treatment, sees models for human
compulsions throughout the animal world _ in the hoarding behavior
of squirrels, for example, or the grooming rituals of rats.
   Among the most valuable resources for researchers are the
growing numbers of OCD victims coming forward for treatment. But
many more remain hidden away.
   ``Typically, they don't camp on your door,'' Turner says. ``Two
percent of the population is still a huge number of people. We're
not seeing them.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Growing herds of California sea lions that
converge on Puget Sound each fall are becoming a nuisance, raiding
the fisheries and getting in the way of divers. It's a Catch 22 for
environmentalists that the law intended to protect endangered
marine mammals also has produced a threat to some endangered fish.

   Fishermen, divers and coastal residents on Puget
Sound are being frustrated by large herds of sea lions and harbor
seals feasting on bottom fish, salmon and endangered steelhead
trout headed upstream to spawn.
   The federal law that protects endangered whales and other marine
mammals prohibits killing the sea lions which kill and eat more
than half of the steelhead run each year.
   Up to 2,000 sea lions converge on Puget Sound each fall and
their numbers are on the rise, wildlife experts say.
   In addition to their threat to the fisheries, floats designed as
divers' rest spots are typically crowded with barking sea lions,
and at least one ferry dock has reeked from their droppings.
   California sea lions arrive from their sunny summer climes off
California in October and November and stay in the Northwest into
April and May before migrating back south.
   Sea lions and harbor seals, which reside year-round in the same
area, have flourished under the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act,
originally designed to save whales, sea otters, and other marine
mammals, including some seals and sea lions, whose numbers were
decimated over the past 100 years.
   ``People like to watch the bears at Yellowstone Park, but if
they get into the garbage cans or pose a threat they are taken and
removed, and if they return once or twice, the animals are
destroyed,'' says James Schmidt of Trout Unlimited in Seattle.
   ``One learns it from the other. You have to learn to eliminate
the ones that have learned to go to the garbage dump.''
   The learning process that brings bears to dumps in parks is the
same learning process that has attracted sea lions to the Ballard
Locks in Seattle, where salmon and steelhead must use a fish ladder
to gain access to fresh waters of Lake Washington and the streams
where they spawn.
   Once one sea lion learns the fish are easy pickings, he brings
his buddies, scientists say.
   ``It's just got worse and worse since 1980,'' says Susan Ewing,
spokeswoman for the Washington Department of Wildlife. She said
that while a few sea lions used to show up, up to 26 sea lions are
expected to be on hand at the fish ladder when steelhead start
running this month.
   Last winter, about 800 wild steelhead managed to spawn, with sea
lions blamed for killing more than that number. The previous
winter, less than 500 fish escaped to spawn.
   A group of commercial and sport fishermen had sought changes in
the Marine Mammal Protection Act this year that would have allowed
federal fisheries managers to shoot sea lions that encroached on
the fish.
   Jerry Pavletich of the Salmon and Steelhead Council of Trout
Unlimited notes that various efforts to chase away the sea lions or
net off the fish ladder approach, have failed.
   Unless the sea lions are somehow driven off, he says, the
endangered wild steelhead could be goners.
   Despite efforts by fishermen, Congress decided against giving
managers the option of killing the sea lions.
   ``I think Congress refused to bite the bullet,'' Pavletich says.
``It's understandable. It's a very emotional issue. There is strong
support to protect marine mammals at any cost. Even at the cost of
our fisheries resources, and that is unfortunate.''
   Congress did, however, continue the act five more years, and is
calling for research into fisheries and mammal resources in the
North Pacific, a move that some fish managers applauded.
   A large environmental coalition, led by Greenpeace, also was
pleased with the outcome in Congress.
   Ben Deeble, Northwest ocean ecology campaigner for Greenpeace,
says Congress simply didn't believe the marine mammals should be
subject to control by lethal means because of the one problem case
in Puget Sound.
   Pavletich says the law allows parties to petition for a review
of marine mammal populations and the head of the U.S. Department of
Commerce could authorize shooting the sea lions in some cases.
   Joe Scordino, marine mammal coordinator for the Northwest
regional office of the National Marine Fisheries Service, says the
sea lion hasn't been endangered since it was hunted in the 1920s.
   Guy Thornburgh, executive director of the Pacific Marine
Fisheries Commission in Portland, Ore., says he would like to see a
regional management council for marine mammals, like the fisheries
commission, to develop a policy on marine mammal management.
   According to Scordino, an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 sea lions
feed in Puget Sound each year, from fall to spring. Each year,
their numbers and the length of their stay appear to be on the
rise, Scordino says.
   There may be as many as 4,000 more sea lions fattening up each
winter in British Columbia's Georgia Strait, and as many as 157,000
may inhabit West Coast waters altogether.
   While direct links between sea lions and hake, or whiting,
stocks haven't been established, Cyreis Schmitt, a state fisheries
marine biologist, said the fishery has plunged from an estimated 45
million pounds in 1983 to 14 million pounds this year.
   She said the fishery may have to be closed for a couple of years
if it's to be saved.
   Sea lions were estimated to have eaten up to 2 million pounds of
hake this year, while fishermen were allowed to take only 500,000
pounds.
   Pat Gearin, biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service, says hake, a much slower fish than salmon or steelhead,
was found in 68 percent of sea lion scat studied in the sound in
1987.
   Meanwhile, harbor seal populations in Northwest coastal waters
have increased 10 percent a year since 1976. They forage freely in
areas where they used to be shot by fishermen, Scordino says.
   More than 75 percent of the gill-net salmon fisheries at Grays
Harbor and Willapa Bay are being destroyed by harbor seals, he
says, adding, ``I think we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.''
   Fortunately, Scordino says, tackling sea lion nuisance problems
unrelated to fisheries has been a lot easier.
   Large timber floats for divers at the Edmonds Underwater Park
were recently replaced with smaller foam floats that the basking,
barking sea lions can't leap onto. A floating platform at the local
ferry dock has been fenced off, so the stench from the beasts is
dissipating.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In the large colonies of Hmong refugees in St.
Paul, Minn., and Fresno, Calif., police are noticing a dramatic
increase in the use of opium, a powerful narcotic that was part of
the culture in Southeast Asia. Federal customs agents have seized
450 shipments of opium bound for Minnesota in the past five years
and they figure that's only a fraction of the amount that got
through.

   In the cold-cream containers mailed to
Xiong Yer Khang from Laos, U.S. Customs inspectors discovered globs
of a black, tar-like substance.
   It was opium, police say, a powerful narcotic from which heroin
and morphine are derived. It's also part of a culture many Hmong
refugees weren't willing to leave behind in Southeast Asia.
   Federal and local authorities say opium smoking is on the rise
in Hmong communities across the country.
   ``It's very cheap, very available, and we're seeing more young
people addicted,'' says Dr. Joseph Westermeyer, who oversees the
treatment of Hmong opium addicts at the University of Minnesota
Hospital in Minneapolis.
   ``It looks like the coming thing,'' says police Lt. Joe Carvalho
of Fresno, Calif., where police recently pulled more than 5,000 red
and violet opium poppies from a Hmong family's backyard garden.
   ``We expect a lot of the Hmong community are using opium because
it's an accepted practice in their own country. We're just trying
to be more aware of what's happening in the Hmong community,
communicate to them that it is not accepted.''
   The Hmong, who fought on the American side during the Vietnam
War, fled to the United States from their native Laos by the tens
of thousands after the end of the war.
   No one knows how many Hmong refugees are smoking opium, but
experts say the stress of adjusting to a radically different
environment accelerates the slide toward addiction.
   ``The stress, frustrations, prejudices, language problem and
family problems probably contribute'' to heavy opium use, says
David Yang, a Hmong community services officer with the St. Paul
Police Department.
   The drug hinders the process of learning to succeed in a new
culture. ``In the United States, I have never seen an opium user
who has a full-time job,'' Yang says.
   ``They are taking food literally out of their families'
mouths,'' adds Westermeyer, an expert on Hmong culture who spent a
decade working in Laos. ``They're not learning the language, not
learning to survive.''
   Fresno, with about 20,000 Hmong, and St. Paul, with about
12,000, have the largest U.S. populations of the refugees from the
mountains and jungles of Laos. Smaller Hmong communities are
scattered around the country in Wisconsin, Missoula, Mont.,
Providence, R.I., and elsewhere.
   St. Paul police gained a new appreciation of the opium problem
last winter when federal customs agents showed them a computer
printout of 450 Minnesota-bound shipments seized in the last five
years, says police Lt. Richard Dugan, head of the narcotics unit.
The seized shipments _ believed to be only a small fraction of the
number that made it through _ ranged in size from a few ounces to
more than 10 pounds.
   Khang, 39, whom police believe is a major opium supplier to St.
Paul's Hmong, is awaiting trial on a charge of narcotics possession
with intent to distribute, as well as a federal narcotics
importation charge. Authorities arrested him in March after
intercepting the cold-cream shipment and then keeping his home
under surveillance.
   Minnesota authorities worry that seizures haven't kept pace with
the flow of the drug into the area.
   There is just one other opium case pending in St. Paul now,
Dugan says. There have been only about 10 opium arrests in the Twin
Cities area in the last decade, says Dick Hendrie, U.S. Customs
narcotics group supervisor in Minneapolis.
   In California's Sacramento Valley, seizures of opium ``have
increased substantially over the last couple years,'' says Orve
Hendrix, resident agent in charge of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's Fresno office.
   ``What were once a few ounces now are 10 pounds or so at a
time,'' he says.
   Police have sometimes been overly tolerant of opium use by the
Hmong.
   ``There was a feeling, `How can you prosecute this poor old man
who fled his country and brought his custom with him?''' Dugan
says. ``And how do you prosecute someone who doesn't realize he
broke the law?''
   In his 1983 book, ``Poppies, Pipes and People: Opium and Its Use
in Laos,'' Westermeyer notes that opium is commonly used as
medicine by a native population short on doctors and pharmacies.
And by custom, he says, respectable households keep some on hand
for guests and special occasions.
   But Westermeyer maintains that heavy use of the poppy's fruit is
no more accepted in Laos than it is here.
   In contrast to St. Paul and Fresno, police in Green Bay, Wis.,
and Missoula, Mont., report no opium problems in their sizable
Hmong communities.
   ``The Hmong people in Montana have acclimated very well,'' says
Missoula police Capt. Bill Foust. ``To my knowledge, there is no
opium use. Either that or we're not on the ball.''
   Dugan says, ``We know there's a lot of it coming in, but we
don't see the problem on the street.
   ``There's always the possibility it will seep out of the Hmong
community into the general population. Then we do have a problem.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's a Pennsylvania prosecutor with a penchant
for performing, getting his message across to the jury with a few
lines from a song. Paul Petro doesn't claim to be another
Pavarotti, or even a Prince, but to him singing is more effective
than boring speeches.

   They call him the singing prosecutor, a
legal eagle given to serenading the judge and jury.
   His trials, one critic says, ``have taken a turn for the verse.''
   A judge complains that singing in court makes light of serious
business.
   No matter, says Assistant District Attorney Paul Petro, singing
often beats a lot of talking.
   ``I don't fancy myself a singer, but I think it's an effective
means of communication,'' Petro says.
   In recent months, the 55-year-old prosecutor has entertained
courtrooms in southwestern Pennsylvania's Washington County with
excerpts from ``Home Sweet Home,'' ``Moonlight and Roses'' and
``Pennies from Heaven.''
   ``A trial attorney can be very effective if he uses references
to literature or poetry that are known by everybody,'' Petro says.
   ``Frankly, I don't think there's anything different in reciting,
say, a famous quotation or excellent poem than singing a couple
lines of a song. After all, when you think about it, the best
writers of concise English are really the lyricists.''
   His latest, tuneful tour de force came during the September
trial of a woman charged with stealing two country music cassettes
from a department store.
   ``Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven,'' Petro
crooned during his opening argument. ``Don't you know each cloud
contains, pennies from heaven. You'll find your fortune falling all
over town.''
   He suddenly switched from song to speech, without missing a beat.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defendant's fortune was
falling all over Gee Bee Department Store,'' he recalls telling the
jury. Then, he says, ``I went into the facts.''
   ``Singing helps to focus the jury's attention to certain things
and to listen to the arguments,'' Petro says. ``But in the great
majority of cases, the jury will follow the facts.''
   Robert McGrew, jury foreman for the retail theft trial, said the
guilty verdict, indeed, was based on testimony and evidence.
   ``Singing just didn't seem appropriate, but that's my opinion.
We didn't discuss it,'' says McGrew, 49, who manages a welding and
fabricating business.
   Juror Tony Gregor, 71, a retired feed mill worker, laughed out
loud and slapped his knee when Petro broke into ``Pennies from
Heaven.''
   ``I was surprised. You very seldom hear anybody singing that
song,'' Gregor says, chuckling. ``Everybody was laughing. Something
new, you know?''
   Washington County Common Pleas Judge David Gilmore was not
amused. It was the second time Petro had burst into song in his
courtroom.
   ``I don't think anything he's done has been prejudicial or I
would have stopped it,'' Gilmore says. ``My only objection is that
it makes light of what is a very serious matter.''
   The Observer-Reporter newspaper noted on the editorial page
following the retail theft trial that Petro ``has done nothing
really wrong here, other than to trivialize the judicial system.''
   ``Save us from the singing prosecutor,'' the headline pleaded.
His trials take ``a turn for the verse,'' Managing Editor Park
Burroughs wrote.
   Criticism, much of it tongue-in-cheek, also has come from
defense attorneys. One lawyer suggested that Petro consider
``Jailhouse Rock.''
   ``Of course, that's not my speed nor would I,'' Petro said.
``That would be inappropriate.''
   Petro insists his musical selections always are relevant,
thankfully few and far between, and in good taste.
   He chose ``Home Sweet Home'' for his opening argument in a
February murder trial before Gilmore, his courtroom singing debut,
to ``indicate this great tragedy occurred in a guy's home.''
   ``It just seemed right to sing,'' says Petro, a baritone. ``I
didn't bother to ask anybody. Probably it's a good thing I didn't.
They would have said, `You're nuts.'''
   In May, Petro put on another a cappella performance, this time
the first line of ``Moonlight and Roses,'' to show that an alleged
burglary occurred on a moonlit night.
   ``Pennies from Heaven'' was Petro's most spontaneous rendition.
He decided to give the defendant ``some special treatment'' for
fear she might be acquitted because of the relative insignificance
of the alleged crime.
   In all three instances, ``it's something I've felt is
appropriate,'' he says. ``I feel it's proper. It's not demeaning.
We're not reducing the courtroom to a variety show.''
   Petro is modest about his signing talents.
   ``I've sung in the church choir, but I've never pretended to be
a soloist,'' he says.
   Every time he's sung, he's won. As a result, Washington County
District Attorney John C. Pettit doesn't object.
   ``Paul does a good job,'' Pettit says. ``I entrust to him some
of the more difficult and complicated cases that come into the
office. If from time to time he feels a certain thing is going to
aid him in making the jury understand his point, then I certainly
don't see anything wrong with it.''
   For Petro, verse is superior to verbosity.
   ``I don't know if you've ever bothered to read court opinions,''
he says. ``They're not considered great literature. I mean, they're
well-written. But they're not the type of material that really
stimulates people.''
   Singing, on the other hand, ``is very effective. I think the
people like it. No question about it because, unfortunately, too
many speeches in the courtroom are boring.''
   Petro has no idea when or what he'll sing next.
   ``To use a pun,'' he says, ``you've got to play it by ear.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He dropped out of school in his native England
at age 15 and eventually became a newspaper reporter. Now, as
creator and host of the syndicated TV show ``Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous,'' Robin Leach doesn't take himself seriously. ``We are
not doing anything constructive,'' he says. ``It's entertainment to
make people smile and laugh or to nudge their neighbors and say,
`Isn't that disgusting?'''

   Robin Leach isn't rich or famous,
according to the foremost authority on the subject _ Robin Leach.
   ``To be rich you have got to start at $50 million,'' says the
host and creator of the syndicated television show, ``Lifestyles of
the Rich and Famous.''
   And although Leach can't go to the local supermarket without
being accosted by autograph seekers, he doesn't consider himself a
celebrity.
   ``I am two people. I sit and watch the show and that's a cartoon
character I see on the screen,'' Leach says in an interview at his
home on a lake in this western Connecticut city.
   As the man responsible for persuading millionaires and
celebrities to open their homes and reveal their bank balances in
televised interviews, the 47-year-old Leach has made the elite and
their toys his specialty.
   The son of an office manager, Leach left school at age 15. He
was working as a night news editor for London's Daily Mail when he
became disillusioned with his low wages and decided to take a year
off.
   ``I'd never been to America and I'd never been to Australia and
I flipped a coin and it came out heads for America,'' says the
native of Harrow, England. ``It was the biggest giggle, it was the
biggest adventure of my life.''
   He arrived in New York City 25 years ago with just $135.
   ``I did not know a soul. I had no contacts. I had no nothing,''
he says. But within a day, he had changed his mind about staying
for just one year.
   ``It was one of those things that I could never explain, that I
could never put into words, but I felt that I had arrived home,''
he says.
   After a three-month stint selling shoes at a department store,
Leach went to work for the New York Daily News.
   He later started his television career reporting for the morning
shows on KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WABC-TV in New York. He joined
Cable News Network's ``People Tonight'' in 1980 and went on to
become a reporter for ``Entertainment Tonight.'' ``Lifestyles'' was
launched in 1983.
   From the time he started work as a newspaper reporter, Leach has
been interested in the world of entertainment, attributing his
fascination to the ``strange and interesting'' people who populate
it.
   A divorced father of three sons, Leach now travels more than
300,000 miles a year to film ``Lifestyles'' and its offshoots,
``Runaway With The Rich and Famous,'' and ``Fame, Fortune and
Romance.''
   All three programs are produced by Televison Program
Enterprises, a division of Telerep, Inc. ``Lifestyles'' airs in 19
countries, including England, which finally bought the show this
year.
   Leach's three-bedroom home is a long way from the shabby hotel
room with a hot plate he rented the day he arrived in the United
States. But compared to the opulence of ``Lifestyles,'' he lives
modestly.
   There is a sunken bathtub in his bedroom, a whirlpool bath in an
annex off the kitchen, and two jet skis bob on the lake at the end
of an ``English'' flower garden. The wine in the cellar, however,
is from local vineyards and a solitary Chrysler is parked in the
driveway.
   Leach attributes the success of ``Lifestyles'' to hard work and
the American Dream.
   ``America has always been basically and traditionally a country
where winning is very important,'' he says.
   ``The American Dream is very much alive and well.
Entrepreneurial behavior, where hard work is rewarded with success,
is the only system in the world that works.''
   Leach works 16 to 17 hours a day, seven days a week, as the
executive producer and part owner of the three television shows.
   As for being a television show host, he says, ``It's a job like
anyone else's job.
   ``The difference is that I don't take what I do very seriously.
How can you? It's not brain surgery, we're not saving lives. We are
not doing anything constructive.
   ``It's entertainment to make people smile and laugh or to nudge
their neighbors and say, `Isn't that disgusting?'''
   He assumed the role of host reluctantly when he could find no
one suitable to do the job, and then cultivated a voice that would
ensure that his listeners stayed tuned.
   Leach's loud, brash, made-for-televison English accent has
become a trademark of ``Lifestyles.''
   ``Some people actually think it's nice,'' he says. ``That's
extraordinary. It's not meant to be nice.''
   He says the knack of getting people to appear on his shows boils
down to the fact that he was often the first one to ask.
   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich are
the only famous people whom Leach is still anxious to interview.
But he says he hasn't even scratched the surface of potential
guests.
   Moreover, with plans for two new shows and contracts for two
books, including a cookbook of recipes enjoyed by the rich and
famous, there is plenty ahead for Leach.
   A memoir will come later, says Leach, who eventually wants to
retire to the Caribbean and write.
   ``There is no burning Hemingway novel inside me, but just one
book of all the madness that went on in the world of the rich and
famous,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Unlike other proud fighting units in World War
II, such as the paratroopers and PT boat crews, the glider pilots
have been all but forgotten. The National World War II Glider
Pilots Association, which has about 1,300 members and was
instrumental in establishing a Silent Wings Museum in Terrell,
Texas, is dedicated to correcting that oversight.

   They were called the silent wings. The men
who flew them had a ``G'' _ for guts _ emblazoned on the silver
wings they wore on their uniforms.
   ``The mass of Americans don't know a thing about the gliders,''
says Bard Coatsworth of Lincoln, a former state commander of the
National World War II Glider Pilots Association.
   ``I decided it's time that we stop sitting around telling old
war stories and let the world know about the contribution of
gliders to the war effort.''
   Gliders owe their military history to the Germans, who were
banned as part of the Versailles Treaty from manufacturing aircraft
with engines, Coatsworth said.
   ``They used them to fly demolition experts across the lines into
France at night to destroy the pillboxes and guardposts.''
   Coatsworth was working at the Lincoln Aviation Institute _ the
same place Charles Lindbergh learned to fly _ when he heard the
Army was looking for experienced pilots for glider training.
   He signed up in July 1942 and wound up at Ong Flying School in
Goodland, Kan., where he got 25 hours of training, landing without
power from various altitudes, day and night.
   From there, it was on to two air bases in Texas and more night
and day dead-stick flying, with some practice in gliders made from
converted power aircraft.
   He got his first glimpse of the Waco CG4A (C for combat, G for
glider) in Lubbock, Texas, and remembers wondering, ``How could
anybody fly a thing like this.''
   The gilder, with a wingspan of 83 feet, 8 inches, an overall
length of 48 feet, 3} inches, and a height of 12 feet and 7-odd
inches, ``looked like a big olive green bomber,'' he says.
   It wasn't designed to be pretty.
   ``It was an aerial truck,'' Coatsworth says, ``but the power
pilots who criticized it didn't know what they were missing. It
handled like a dream.''
   Although the war ended before Coatsworth had to fly a glider in
combat, he did have some rather harrowing experiences during
training.
   Once the tow rope broke loose from the power aircraft pulling
the glider and narrowly missed breaking the windshield of the
glider. The rope became tangled around the landing gear and
Coatsworth had to maneuver the craft through a clearing in some
trees to land.
   Snagging the rope would have resulted in a crash, he said.
   On a night run, Coatsworth and his co-pilot had to cut free
because they were incorrectly signaled that the tow plane was in
trouble. Coatsworth and his co-pilot had a choice of landing on a
highway with traffic or at a rock quarry.
   ``We set it down about 20 feet short of the edge of the quarry,
in snake-infested country,'' he says. ``We spent the night on the
wing until they found us in the morning.''
   Coatsworth, assigned to the 66th Squadron of the 403rd Troop
Carrier Group, said the CG4A could carry 13 soldiers and a crew of
two. Some carried mini-bulldozers, Jeeps or mortars.
   The gliders were first used in the war on July 9, 1943, when
they carried British airborne troops from an airfield in Tunisia to
Axis-held Sicily.
   In February 1944, gliders carried troops and equipment behind
enemy lines in Burma to set up landing areas to be used in a
massive air assault that surprised the Japanese.
   Gliders played a key role in the D-day invasion of Normandy on
June 6, 1944, and saw action in southern France, Holland, Bastogne
and Varsity.
   ``They were slated to join forces for a final airborne assault
on Japan proper, but we dropped the big one before it came to
that,'' Coatsworth says.
   Coatsworth says the National World War II Glider Pilots
Association, formed in 1971, has about 1,300 members. He estimates
there were probably 10,000 men trained to fly gliders.
   The association was instrumental in establishing a Silent Wings
Museum in Terrell, Texas, near Dallas, where people can view one of
several restored CG4A gliders and other memorabilia.
   ``My big concern now is that we get our proper place in
history,'' Coatsworth says.
   ``All the other services _ the paratroopers, the PT boat crews,
and the like _ have gotten theirs, and I don't deny them that. But
it's time now for the country to recognize the glider pilots.''

   LOS ANGELES _ ABC's ``War and Remembrance,'' the sequel to ``The
Winds of War,'' is more of a megaseries than a miniseries.
   Filmed at a cost of $104 million, it will run at least 30 hours,
making it the most expensive and the longest-running film project
of all time.
   The first 18 hours will be televised on seven nights over an
11-day period beginning Sunday. The final 12 hours are still being
edited for showing after the first of the year. However, the exact
number of hours will not be determined until the editing is
completed.
   ``The Winds of War'' and ``War and Remembrance'' are based on
the best-selling novels by Herman Wouk. The first told of the
coming of World War II. The second is about the winning of the war.
   The first miniseries ran 18 hours in February 1983 and attracted
an estimated 140 million viewers.
   The sequel, which includes 1,785 scenes, was filmed at 267
locations in six countries over a 14-month period. It has 358
speaking parts.
   Robert Mitchum continues his role as Victor ``Pug'' Henry, the
naval officer who was on the scene for many of the events leading
up to the war in ``The Winds of War.'' In the new show he is
promoted to admiral and participates in the major sea battles in
the Pacific.
   But the sequel also will feature some new faces in starring
roles.
   Hart Bochner, rejected as too young for ``The Winds of War,''
grew into the role for the sequel.
   Nearly eight years ago, Bochner met with producer-director Dan
Curtis to talk about the role of Byron Henry, the youngest son of
Pug Henry, who marries Natalie Jastrow (Ali MacGraw) in Italy just
as World War II begins.
   ``Dan felt I was too young,'' Bochner says.
   Instead, the role in the 1983 miniseries went to Jan-Michael
Vincent.
   Bochner picks up the role of Byron Henry a few days after Pearl
Harbor. He is a submarine officer in action in the Pacific.
Natalie, who is Jewish, is trapped in Europe and is trying to stay
one step ahead of the Nazis. Natalie, now played by Jane Seymour,
is accompanied by their child, Louis, and her Uncle Aaron.
   Sir John Gielgud takes over the role of Aaron Jastrow from John
Houseman.
   Victoria Tennant, Polly Bergen, David Dukes, Peter Graves, Chaim
Topol, Jeremy Kemp and Ralph Bellamy return in their roles from the
first miniseries.
   The story, Bochner says, ``focuses on the family and how their
lives are affected by the war.''
   ``You don't get just an overview,'' he says. ``You get details
because somebody from the family is usually there. You see me in
the submarine, my dad on the battleships, Natalie at Auschwitz, my
sister's husband at Los Alamos developing the bomb.''
   Since completing the miniseries, Bochner has also starred with
Bruce Willis in ``Die Hard'' and went to Argentina for a
psychological thriller called ``Apartment Zero.''
   Bochner, the son of actor Lloyd Bochner, made his film debut
during his college freshman year as one of the sons of George C.
Scott in ``Islands in the Stream.'' He didn't work again until he
graduated, then played the bad guy in ``Breaking Away.'' He has
worked mostly in feature films and miniseries.
   This is the third miniseries Bochner has been opposite Jane
Seymour. In the first, ``East of Eden,'' he was her son. In the
second, ``The Sun Also Rises,'' he was her love interest. And in
``War and Remembrance,'' they are married.
   ``I was working on `Making Mr. Right' when I signed for the
role,'' he says. ``I read the books to get acquainted with the
character. I'd never seen `Winds of War' because I was out of the
country when it came out. So I stayed away from it. I wanted to
have my own interpretation.
   ``Byron in the beginning is not terribly focused. For lack of a
better reason, he gets involved in the Navy because of parental
pressure. He had been studying art in Europe. It was his boyishness
and brashness and passion that appealed to this older woman.''
   Bochner spent several months in Europe for the sequences in
which he becomes a naval courier and attempts to find his wife and
child. But most of his scenes are at sea aboard submarines.
   The Navy has only two World War II diesel submarines, so it was
necessary to tow a boat on display at Pearl Harbor out to sea.
   To prepare for the role, Bochner spent a week aboard a nuclear
submarine operating off California.
   ``When we shot the battle sequences I thought at first something
had gone wrong with the special effects,'' says Bochner. ``The
explosions were so powerful. They rocked the whole boat.
   ``We filmed under some pretty tough conditions. The temperature
inside the sub never got below 110 degrees. We worked 15 hours a
day. Our objective was to re-create life exactly as it was on a
submarine _ hot, exhausting and frightening.''

   When actress Bonnie Franklin first tried to land
the role of Frankie in ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,''
she couldn't even get an audition.
   Frankie, a wary, never-married waitress in a definitely
down-scale diner, wasn't anything like Ann Romano, the divorced,
working mother of two girls on TV's ``One Day at a Time,'' the role
Miss Franklin played for nine years.
   Casting directors, Miss Franklin says, ``think that's who you
are, rather than what you play. It's real frustrating because I
know what I can do.''
   Kathy Bates and Kenneth Welsh, the original Frankie and Johnny,
were replaced by Carol Kane and Bruce Weitz. When Kane and Weitz
decided to leave, Miss Franklin put in another, this time
successful, appeal to audition.
   Miss Franklin and Tony Musante, known from TV's ``Toma,'' went
into ``Frankie and Johnny'' on Sept. 13, after three weeks'
rehearsal. They're enjoying the collaboration so much they want to
work together again.
   ``We're so lucky,'' she says. ``There're only two of us out
there on stage. The trust has to be extraordinary. It could have
been we didn't trust each other and didn't get along.''
   The play is about the relationship between a waitress and a
short-order cook. He decides on their first date they should become
a couple. She, having been physically hurt and then dumped by a
longtime lover, wants a man in her life but is afraid to allow
herself to be vulnerable again.
   ``It's a wonderful play,'' Miss Franklin says. ``The more I do
it, the more I love it.''
   Audiences identify with Frankie, Miss Franklin says. ``She is
afraid to be left, damaged and hurt again in her life. I think
elements of that are in all of us.
   ``Johnny pushes so hard. Men don't want to see themselves as
steamrollers. But he's saying `Love me; let me into your life.' He
finally tells her, `I'm not good with people.'
   ``I think people get things from the play, wherever their own
pain is _ children, marriage, commitment or whatever. This is such
a love story. We've all had successes and failures in that part of
our lives. I think that's what affects so many people. And Terrence
McNally writes so beautifully, in a certain poetic rhythm.''
   She saw the play originally, Miss Franklin says, after her
husband of eight years, producer Marvin Minoff, saw it with his
daughter.
   ``I loved it,'' she says. ``I knew I would be wonderful in it
and I wanted to play it. I knew the director, Paul Benedict. We
both worked in Norman Lear's factory. He was in `The Jeffersons'
for nine years as the U.N. representative.
   ``I called him and said, `I saw your play and I want to replace
Kathy.' He said, `I'll put you on a list.' The producers didn't see
me. Maybe it was because of `One Day at a Time.' I wouldn't be
playing the mother of two kids.'' Miss Franklin recalls that after
her Broadway debut in the musical ``Applause'' she had trouble
being considered for anything other than musicals.
   She thought she'd have lots of time to see movies and friends
while acting in New York, Miss Franklin says, but finds that only
from noon till 4 p.m. can she ``have a life other than the work.''
   She starts preparing for the play about 4 p.m. ``I take a nap. I
get up and wash my hair. I think it is important for the show that
my hair not have a real stylish cut. I bought an ankle bracelet,
three rings and earrings and painted my toenails. That's all
Frankie.
   ``I take a good, strong half-hour walk to the theater. When I
get there, I light a candle, put on classical music and do vocal
exercises. There's a lot of talking in this play.''
   Asked about the future, Miss Franklin says, ``I know I'm going
back home to Los Angeles in January. I think it's important I have
a marriage. I wouldn't mind going back on TV. Tony and I are hoping
we'll get Terrence McNally to write us a series.''

<DATELINE>GOVERNADOR VALADARES, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Ronaldo Perim readily
acknowledges it: at least 30,000 residents of Governador Valadares
_ a tenth of its population _ are in the United States, most
illegally, and others are doing everything they can to follow them.
   They don't want to stay there, he indicated _ just make their
fortunes ``in the land of opportunity'' and return home to live in
the financial comfort that escapes many Brazilians in these days of
economic hardship.
   In August, 46 Brazilians were discovered stowed away amid sacks
of cocoa beans and coffee on a cargo ship docked in Philadelphia.
   Forty were from Governado Valadares.
   Of the stowaways, nine escaped from U.S. immigration officials
and the rest, who were sent home, vowed to try again.
   A lot of the United States has rubbed off on Governador
Valadares. English commonly is heard along with Brazil's Portuguese
language on its tree-lined streets and in it cheery one-family
homes. Goods can be paid for in dollars as well as Brazilian
cruzados.
   People speak of traveling to the United States, 4,000 miles
north, as they do of a jaunt to Rio de Janeiro, 400 miles south.
   ``I worked like crazy in the worst jobs to make enough money to
live without worry in Brazil now,'' said Luis DeAmorim, 39, who
said he spent 20 years living illegally in the United States before
earning enough money to open a small restaurant in Governador
Valadares.
   DeAmorim took 11 members of his family with him when in 1966 he
moved to ``America,'' as they call it here. He lived up and down
the Northeast coast working as a bellboy in hotels, clearing tables
in restaurants and assisting passengers on cruise ships.
   ``There's no way to earn money here,'' said Altair Silveira, 40,
who first headed northward in 1967, to work illegally on a U.S.
tourist visa, and who has returned regularly since being deported
in 1969 to visit his son and daughter-in-law in Florida.
   ``In America you can save money to start a decent life, buy a
house, a car, things you could never have on a Brazilian salary,''
he said.
   Brazil never has been a major source of illegal emigration to
the United States. But with inflation spiraling at a projected
annual rate of 2,000 percent, unemployment at 25 percent and wages
40 percent lower in real terms than they were two years ago, more
and more Brazilians have their eyes on ``America.''
   ``The growing number of Brazilians living illegally in the
United States is a source of concern,'' said Clyde Bishop, head of
the Consular Section at the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro. ``We
must take firmer steps to reverse the trend before there is an
explosion.''
   Brazil, Latin America's largest country, has a population of
more than 143 million.
   Though precise figures on illegal aliens are hard to come by,
Brazil's Consulate in New York City estimates about 100,000
Brazilians live in New York state, half of them illegally. A
similar number are thought to live in Florida, and thousands more
in Boston and Newark, N.J.
   According to Brazil's federal police, 1.25 million citizens have
emigrated legally over the past three years to the United States,
Canada, Italy, Portugal and Australia. But thousands more simply
overstayed tourist visas or sneaked into foreign countries.
   Some have unpleasant memories of life in ``America.''
   ``No one likes living in the United States,'' said Silveira, who
was deported nearly 20 years ago. ``To the contrary, people live in
such awful conditions to save money that they come back with bitter
feelings.''
   There is even a bimonthly newspaper for the homesick, the
Tribuna Brasileira, which is printed in Governador Valadares and
sent to some 10,000 Brazilians abroad.
   According to Mayor Perim, the city's economy depends on money
earned in the United States and sent home. Each month, people who
have emigrated send an estimated $3 million to relatives at home,
and often the money goes to pay installments on a new home.
   In Governador Valadares, new office and apartment buildings have
risen between chic boutiques, jutting above the barren rural
landscape. According to Jose Tavares, who owns a construction
company, 46 high rises are currently being built and more than half
will be higher than 10 floors.

   ``It would be a financial disaster for the city if the U.S.
channel were closed off,'' Perim said. ``The city would literally
collapse, without resources or jobs.''
   The ties between Governador Valadares and the United States are
almost as old as the city, which grew up in the late 1930s around
its rich mineral deposits, principally mica. During World War II,
U.S. technicians established mica mines and built a railroad from
Governador Valadares to Vitoria on the Atlantic coast.
   After the war, mica dropped sharply in value. Governador
Valadares turned to timber, but it soon ran out. In the late 1960s,
with no new income sources in sight, some 20 residents, now called
``pioneers,'' turned to the United States.
   During the 1970s, years of economic prosperity in Brazil, plenty
of jobs were available and emigration fell off. But it picked up
again in the recession-plagued 1980s. In 1985 the federal police in
Governador Valadares issued 1,747 passports, 2,408 in 1986, and
3,568 in 1987. That number is expected to double this year, a
federal police source said.
   ``Here I earn about 50,000 cruzados ($100) a month but I know
that in America I can earn at least seven times that amount,'' said
taxi driver Jose Reis. ``I'll do anything I must to get in.''
   Last year the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro issued 70,000
tourist visas, refusing about 25 percent of applicants, Bishop
said. This year the Consulate expects to issue 95,000 visas with
the same rejection rate, with an additional 20 percent probably to
be turned away by immigration officials at U.S. airports.
   A shady market of false documents, visas and illegal trips has
grown up around the exodus.
   In just one year, the number of travel agencies in Governador
Valadares grew from four to 13. Most opened their doors with
offerings of illegal, guided trips across the Mexican border at
$3,000 a person.
   Despite the financial benefits for the city, many in Governador
Valadares are concerned by the number of neighbors moving northward.
   A theater director, Wilson Lambari, month filled a 500-seat
theater for a month with his latest production, ``Last One to Leave
Turn Out the Lights,'' a comic revue that tells of the tough life
immigrants face in the United States.
   The Rev. Jaime Gradusen, a Roman Catholic priest, said he
cautions in his weekly sermons against pursuit of what he calls the
``holy dollar.''
   ``Often husbands go off leaving their wives behind, and when
they return, the wives have taken up with someone else,'' Gradusen
said. ``And most of those who make the trip sell everything they
have to meet the costs. They often take out a loan that they can't
always repay. We want people to see that they risk their happiness
in the name of making money.''
   The economic crisis has spurred other Brazilians to think of
leaving.
   An August opinion poll published by the newspaper Folha de S.
Paulo showed 62 percent of those in Sao Paulo, the country's
largest city, would live abroad if they could.

   On a recent Saturday, the Tagansky Gastronome had
for sale: one fresh green vegetable, two kinds of fresh fruit,
pig's heads and trotters and beef that was at least half fat and
gristle. There was no veal, no lamb, no fresh fish, no other kinds
of pork.
   Muscovites consider the Tagansky one of their city's finest
supermarkets.
   Before 9 a.m., about 200 shoppers were lined up across the dirty
concrete floor waiting to buy soft gray sausages that looked like
knockwurst. Others snapped up bunches of onions, plastic sacks of
apples and green, unripe Cuban grapefruit.
   A poster hanging by the bread counter read: ``Conserve bread _
it's the property of the people.''
   In the eight aisles of the southeast Moscow store, and others
like it nationwide, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ambitious
economic vision runs smack into gritty Soviet reality. In the
fourth year of Gorbachev's tenure, what people here euphemistically
call ``the food question'' seems as acute as ever. x}Ptis program of economic
reform depends in large part on his government's ability to improve
the food supply and convince the public his program is worth the
greater effort it demands.
   In a country that has experienced at least two disastrous
famines in a lifetime, many if not most Soviets gauge Gorbachev's
drive for ``perestroika,'' or restructuring, by what it puts on
their grocery shelves.
   Nikolai G. Belov, deputy director of the state committee on
statistics, told reporters recently that food supplies reaching
Soviet stores are short by more than 1.3 billion rubles ($2 billion
at the official exchange rate) of the annual need and the 1988
economic plan.
   Gorbachev told a key Communist Party meeting on agriculture that
even factories in the Soviet defense complex have been put to work
making farm implements with the goal of improving the nation's
harvest, and consequently, its diet.
   ``Life demands that the earth should produce, and that livestock
units should produce, because that produce is greatly needed by our
society,'' Gorbachev told the Oct. 12 meeting.
   To better feed Soviets, Gorbachev, himself the son of a Russian
peasant, has broken with 60 years of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy to
call for the leasing of arable land around the nation to individual
farmers.
   For Americans accustomed to year-round abundance, freshness and
a choice of supermarkets, the food situation in the other
superpower is frankly bleak. At the delivery end of the food chain,
in stores like the Tagansky Gastronome, what the Russians call
``deficits'' _ chronic shortages _ are wide-ranging and frequent.
   ``It is humiliating that we still aren't able to feed ourselves,
buying even bread, and oil, and meat, and fruits, and vegetables
abroad,'' the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko lamented in a much-discussed
essay published this year. ``The rationing system that we have in
many regions is our shame.''
   After 70 years of Soviet power, some food items regarded in the
West as staples are rationed in eight of this country's 15
constituent republics. According to recent reports in the state-run
media:
   _Food shortages are so acute in parts of the Russian Federation
that meat is rationed in 26 regions, butter in 32, and sugar in 53.
Some regions cover more territory some individual U.S. states.
   _In the Ural mountain city of Berezniki, meat is so scarce that
residents can buy only 300 to 400 grams of sausage a month, the
equivalent of five or six good-sized hot dogs.
   _Food is so short in Ryazan, Kalinin and other Russian cities
that their residents stream into Moscow and each year carry off a
half-million tons of meat and meat products alone. A joke goes:
What is long, green and smells like sausage? Answer: The
Moscow-to-Tula train.
   The Soviet Union is no land of freeze-dried, vacuum-packed,
microwavable, one-stop food shopping either. For many, finding
something good for the dinner table is an ordeal and challenge that
can mean hours of being jostled in line, dealing with surly shop
clerks, and frustration over long-term ``deficits.''
   ``You get mad at city officials every time you go shopping after
working hours or try to get a bite to eat downtown,'' the weekly
Moscow News groused in a recent criticism of the capital's
state-run stores and restaurants.
   Many Soviets have alternate food sources. One Yaroslavl factory
runs its own pig farm and greenhouses to supply employees with pork
and cucumbers. Peasants with private plots can sell their produce
in special markets for more than the price fixed in state stores.
   Outside the Tagansky, a man with a moustache hawks persimmons
from the southern republic of Moldavia. He belongs to a
cooperative, one of the free associations of producers and vendors
that Gorbachev is counting on to relieve the country's consumer
shortages.
   Perks for top party and government officials include food
parcels and access to a special network of shops selling meat,
sturgeon, caviar and other hard-to-find items. Bureaucrats' black
Volga sedans regularly pull up to the rear door of the Tagansky,
and drivers enter to fetch cardboard boxes crammed with delicacies.
   Not all news from the farm is bleak. Belov said overall
agricultural output increased 4 percent in the past nine months
compared to the same period in 1987. There will be less grain and
fewer potatoes than last year, but more corn, he said.
   But as Nikita S. Khrushchev, the late premier, once said, ``You
can't make pancakes out of statistics.''
   An American food processing expert who visited Soviet packaging
plants this summer estimated that one potato in two never makes
from farm to market because it is ruined or rots in transit and
storage.
   By improving the way crops are harvested, transported, stored,
processed and delivered to consumers, the country could increase
production on some foodstuffs by as much as 40 percent, Gorbachev
told the meeting on agriculture.
   Until this is done, however, ``deficits'' will remain an
exasperating part of Soviet life.
   On a recent train trip, a Western reporter offered a cup of
Western-made instant coffee to a traveling companion, a
professional violinist from Moscow.
   The man tasted the coffee, sighed, and said: ``You know, our
Soviet instant coffee is better. But there isn't any of it.''

   Before clocking in at her job in central Moscow
one recent morning, Nina Ivanova was already working to find the
makings of that night's dinner for herself and her husband.
   By the time she finished, she had spent two hours 17 minutes in
lines, taken a side trip on a streetcar, and paid a total of 14
rubles ($22.80). Although Ms. Ivanova earns more than the average
industrial worker's salary of 200 rubles ($322) a month, the meal
turned out to be an expensive one not only in money but also in
time.
   In the morning, Ms. Ivanova stood in line for 20 minutes at a
Moscow supermarket to buy two frozen chickens. The scrawny looking
fowl, sold in plastic bags, cost 4.72 rubles ($7.69), or $1.30 a
pound, heads and feet included.
   Mrs. Ivanova was late to work because of the delay. She worked
until 6 p.m., and then took the subway to Lenin Prospekt in the
city's southwest.
   At a butcher's shop, Mrs. Ivanova waited in line for 43 minutes
to buy beef for the beet soup, or borscht, she had decided to
prepare. The meat, enough for generous helpings for two people,
cost her 3.75 rubles ($6.11).
   She then hopped on a streetcar and rode for 15 minutes to a
vegetable store. Once more she stood in line, this time for 37
minutes, and bought beets, cabbage, potatoes and some grapes for
dessert. Cost: 3.43 rubles ($5.59).
   One ingredient was still missing for the borscht _ sour cream.
Lugging her purchases, Mrs. Ivanova walked to a milk shop, where
she waited 22 minutes to buy an enormous dollop of the cream the
Russians call ``smetana.'' It cost 1.70 rubles ($2.77).
   There was one final stop for Mrs. Ivanova _ the bakery. She
stood in line there for 15 minutes to buy two loaves of bread for
40 kopecks (65 cents).
   When Mrs. Ivanova returned home to her one-room apartment, it
was 8:30 p.m. By the time she and her husband sat down to a dinner
of borscht, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and grapes, it was 11:30
p.m.
   According to Mrs. Ivanova, it was an all-too-typical day.

   At this 25th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's
assassination, it's fair to ask, ``What if he had lived?'' And it's
fair to say that he does live on _ in the reflections of friends
and advisers he inspired and in the emotions of millions of
Americans, feelings nowhere more evident, ironically, than at his
grave.

   Mesmerized by the commanding view of
Washington from a hill atop Arlington National Cemetery, John
Kennedy remarked in 1963 that he could stay there forever. Later
that year, an assassin would strike him down, and he would be
buried near the site he admired so.
   In a city filled with monuments and memorials, the Kennedy grave
site, striking in its simplicity, remains to many the nation's most
emotional symbol of life and death, of hope and lost dreams, even
25 years after his violent death.
   ``Kennedy's grave brings out a lot of emotions in people,'' said
Kerri Childress, the cemetery's historian who was a second-grader
when the president was gunned down in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
   ``A lot of memories come back. People don't just remember
Kennedy's assassination. They remember that whole period of their
lives, their families, their friends. People tell me they remember
smells, sounds.''
   Adults weep openly at the grave. Admirers silently leave flowers
on the granite bed. A blind woman, after visiting the cemetery
dozens of times, cried when she ``saw'' it for the first time as
she was allowed to run her fingers over the stones and feel the
heat from the eternal flame.
   There's another eternal flame. It burns warmly in the memories
of those who knew and served with Kennedy, friends and advisers who
can visualize him still alive, still keeping a hand in the
direction of his nation.
   ``Without question, he would have continued to be an extremely
active, public-spirited, heavily involved person in all matters
that would have to do with social progress and world peace,'' said
Lawrence O'Brien, who served as the Kennedy White House's liaison
to Congress.
   He recalls the late president occasionally referring to life
after the White House _ he would have been only 51 if he'd served
the maximum eight years _ and the talk revolved around academic
life, perhaps at his alma mater, Harvard University.
   Instead, Harvard renamed its government school in Kennedy's
honor as a ``living memorial'' to the 35th president.
   David F. Powers, one of Kennedy's closest confidants from his
first campaign for Congress to that tragic November day, envisioned
a post-presidential Kennedy as a roving ambassador of sorts.
   Kennedy used to wonder why former presidents ``weren't put to
better use,'' according to Powers, who served as a special
assistant to JFK. ``I think Kennedy would have gone to the Soviet
Union or wherever was necessary.''
   Childress recalls a delegation of Soviet generals visiting JFK's
grave. In minute detail, they told where they were and what they
were doing when they heard the news that the president, who had
confronted their own leader over Cuba but later joined Nikita
Khruschev in a nuclear Test Ban Treaty, was dead.
   Like many Americans, they wondered what might have been.
   O'Brien and Powers doubt Kennedy would have run for political
office after serving two presidential terms, but others wonder.
   ``It's just possible he might have stayed in politics, going
back to the Senate,'' said Dean Rusk, who served as Kennedy's
secretary of state.
   Author and former Kennedy aide Richard Goodwin agrees, saying
that the late president would have followed the example of John
Quincy Adams. The sixth president was the only one to return to a
lower public office after serving in the White House. Adams served
in the House for 18 years after his single term as president.
   ``He would have run for office and would have stood for a
continuing voice on national affairs, and would now be the senior
senator from Massachusetts,'' Goodwin said. Kennedy's youngest
brother, Edward M. Kennedy, is the state's senior senator.
   ``He talked about two things: a Kennedy library and writing, but
that wasn't his life,'' Goodwin said, suggesting such academic
pursuits were too sedentary for a man of action.
   McGeorge Bundy, Kennedy's national security adviser during such
tumultuous times as the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban missile crisis,
took the idea of Kennedy holding public office after the presidency
a step further.
   ``He'd probably agree with Ronald Reagan on exactly one subject:
that the 22nd Amendment is a nuisance,'' Bundy said, referring to
the constitutional amendment that limits presidents to two terms.
``I think by now he'd be ready to try again.
   ``If they had repealed the 22nd Amendment, let's say five years
ago, this (election) might be Reagan vs. Kennedy,'' he said. ``It
would be quite an encounter.'' Kennedy would have been six years
younger than Reagan.
   If JFK had lived, Rusk thinks he would still be revered, but the
Kennedy years would not have taken on mythic proportions.
   ``He would not have given any thought to the idea of Camelot,''
Rusk said. ``His time in office was a serious time. There was
nothing `Camelot' about it. His life was filled with serious
crises.''
   Though it's difficult to guess how a living Kennedy would be
viewed by Americans today, his grave tells something.
   An estimated 4 million visitors each year walk up the steps to a
large, elliptical plaza surrounded by a short granite wall that
contains quotations from Kennedy's 1961 inaugural address.
   To the northeast, through a valley of trees, is a clear view of
the Lincoln Memorial across the Potomac, linking Kennedy to another
martyred president. To the southwest and up a grassy hill is the
Custis-Lee Mansion, the one-time home of Robert E. Lee and the
place where Kennedy made his remarks about the beauty of Arlington
shortly before his death. Robert Kennedy's grave lies near his
brother's.
   Up another short set of steps is a rectangular terrace that
includes the JFK grave site, an 18-by-30-foot area. The focal point
is the eternal flame, lit during the interment ceremony by his
widow, Jacqueline.
   How many of the grave's visitors silently echo JFK aide Powers?
   ``What might have been,'' he said, ``we'll never know.''

   Americans rank John F. Kennedy as the nation's
greatest president, remembering him with a striking sense of loss a
quarter-century after his assassination, a Media General-Associated
Press poll has found.
   But Kennedy's exalted place in history rests more on his
potential and his personal qualities than on his accomplishments in
office. In the national survey he was rated far higher on charisma
than on other attributes.
   Slightly more than one-fifth of the 1,125 adults surveyed picked
Kennedy as the greatest U.S. president, more than named any other.
Only Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln came close in
popularity.
   Among all respondents, a plurality rated Kennedy as a good
president, not a great one. Still, a majority said they believed
that had he lived and served a second term, the United States would
be a better place today.
   Kennedy, at 43 the youngest president elected, served nearly
three years before he was shot and killed in a Dallas motorcade
Nov. 22, 1963. Twenty-five years later, his name is invoked and his
words are quoted by politicians seeking to assume his mantle of
popularity.
   In more recent years, the Kennedy image crumbled a bit with
reports of extramarital affairs and of meetings with a Mafia boss.
In the survey, Kennedy's judgment was rated lower than other
qualities.
   Most striking, however, was the depth of feeling associated with
the slain president. More than six in 10 respondents said they
still felt a personal loss from Kennedy's assassination, including
many who were children or were not yet born in 1963. Among his
contemporaries, seven in 10 feel a loss.
   In another gauge, the poll asked if respondents remembered where
they were when they heard Kennedy had been killed. Of those 30 and
older now _ meaning they were at least 5 years old then _ more than
90 percent said yes.
   To order the pantheon of presidents, the survey asked: ``Who do
you think was the greatest American president?'' Kennedy was named
by 21 percent; Lincoln and Roosevelt, 17 percent each; Harry Truman
and Ronald Reagan, 7 percent each. Kennedy has led similar lists in
other polls over the years.
   Kennedy was most popular with 30- to 44-year-olds, who were
children or teen-agers when he served; nearly a third of them
called him the greatest president. In other ratings as well, that
group viewed Kennedy especially favorably.
   Kennedy, who moved to enforce civil rights laws in the South,
also was rated particularly highly by blacks. Eight in 10 felt a
personal loss from his death, and 60 percent of blacks called him a
great president, compared to 31 percent of whites.
   Overall, a third of respondents said Kennedy was a great
president and 40 percent said a good one. He did better with
Democrats and the less-educated, and as the first Roman Catholic
president, he was rated highly by Catholics.
   Kennedy also was more popular with liberals, but his standing to
a great degree transcended ideology. He achieved his high ratings
even though 40 percent identified him as a liberal, while only 15
percent identified themselves as liberals.
   To gauge the components of Kennedy's image, the poll took
measures _ excellent, good, fair or poor _ of his accomplishments
as president, his potential for accomplishments had he not been
assassinated, and his leadership, judgment and charisma.
   Although he was rated highly in all categories, Kennedy drew far
and away the best ratings for his charisma _ 60 percent excellent.
Next were his leadership and his potential, both rated excellent by
39 percent.
   But Kennedy's excellent ratings fell off on his accomplishments
and his judgment: In both, about two in 10 said excellent. Half
said good, but in his only sizable negative scores, more than a
fifth rated him just fair in both categories.
   There was a partisan aspect to many of the ratings. Fifty-two
percent overall said the nation would be a better place had Kennedy
lived and served a second term; that included 68 percent of the
Democrats polled, compared to 34 percent of the Republicans.
   Doubts emerged on the specific issue of Vietnam. About a third
said Kennedy would have prevented the United States from becoming
deeply involved in the fighting there, but 44 percent said not. The
rest didn't know.
   The survey found considerable familiarity with Kennedy; more
than half the respondents 30 and over said they knew a great deal
about him. But such awareness waned among younger adults: Of those
18-29, only 25 percent shared that sense of familiarity with the
former president.
   The poll, conducted Sept. 6-14, had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points.

   Oh, how the world has changed in 25 years.
   Then, McDonald's bragged ``Over a Billion Hamburgers Sold from
Coast to Coast,'' now it's simply ``billions and billions.'' The
Chrysler Theater was on the air, the Weavers were on their farewell
performance tour, and George Lincoln Rockwell and his American Nazi
Party were peddling hate. In those days of the quickening civil
rights movement, blacks still were referred to in newspapers as
Negroes.
   In 1963, ``superb men's suits'' sold in the Robert Hall clothing
chain for $39.95, sirloin strip steaks went for $1.39 a pound, a
quart of Dewar's White Label was $6.39. Snow tires on sale were
$10.22, wheel balancing and mounting free. Joe Palooka and Terry
and The Pirates were in the funnies and so was Pogo. Condoms were
sold in gas station restroom vending machines or from under the
counter in drug stores. Boys still blushed when they asked for them.
   Tempus fugit. Time flies.
   It stood still that day in Dallas when John F. Kennedy was
killed. But the world that he knew _ and that knew him _ is a
different world today.
   Then, it cost $950 to send a kid to a state college, $1,907 to a
private school _ room, board and tuition. Now those figures are
$4,445 and $11,330.
   Northern Rhodesia of Kennedy's day is Zambia. Southern Rhodesia
is Zimbabwe. The United Nations' 113 member states have grown to
159, the world's population from 3.2 billion to more than 5
billion, America's from 189 million to 244 million.
   China, then an outcast, a technological pygmy, now bids to
launch American satellites. The Soviet Union, which rattled the
nuclear saber and blustered ``we will bury you'' in Kennedy's time,
is working with the United States to reduce the number of horrible
weapons.
   At the time of Kennedy's Cuban missile crisis, the United States
had 5,000 nuclear weapons, the Soviets only 300. Now each country
has over 25,000.
   Kennedy revived Depression-era food stamps as a pilot program;
now 19 million people use them. The number of farms in the United
States has fallen by more than 1 million, to fewer than 2.2 million.
   Baseball's major leagues crossed the border to embrace Montreal
and Toronto. Oakland, Seattle, San Diego and Atlanta got into the
majors and so have Arlington, Texas, halfway between Dallas and
Fort Worth, and Anaheim, Calif., home of Disneyland. The nation's
game, however, is no longer played professionally in the nation's
capital.
   If you were shopping for early Christmas presents in 1963 you
could choose from wood tennis rackets, home movie projectors,
portable typewriters, most of which can still be gotten but who
needs them in the days of graphite rackets, camcorders and laptop
computers?
   You couldn't buy a telephone then; you can now.
   When people talked about using ``calculators,'' they meant slide
rules or adding machines. You could take the SS France to Europe,
buy a VW bug, which everyone thought would be around forever. Cars
from Japan? Don't be silly.
   In 1963, Jack Nicklaus became the second golfer ever to make
$100,000 _ Arnie Palmer, of course, was the first. But that was
before television invented Sunday afternoons. Last year Curtis
Strange set the record for a single season, winning $925,941.
   Buddhist priests were dousing themselves with gasoline and
setting themselves afire in Vietnam. Kennedy had sent in 16,000
advisers, the advance contingent for America's longest and most
controversial war that saw 543,400 troops there at the high point.
More than 58,000 young Americans lost their lives.
   People have become famous who weren't born yet or were
pre-schoolers when Kennedy was killed. Michael J. Fox, the actor;
Amy Carter, the presidential daughter; Jose Canseco, the World
Series ballplayer; Mike Tyson, the heavyweight champion; Carl
Lewis, the runner; Greg Louganis, the diver. Among the teen-agers
of that day, Steven Jobs, the computer whiz; Albert Gore, the
senator; Dan Quayle, the vice presidential nominee.
   John Kennedy's federal budget proposal for 1964 envisioned
spending $98.8 billion, a record, with $11.9 billion in red ink.
The deficit built into in Ronald Reagan's 1989 proposal _ $129.5
billion _ is more than the entire Kennedy budget.
   The debt ceiling was $315 billion. It is now _ hold your breath
_ $2.8 trillion. That's 2,800 billion dollars. Or:
$2,800,000,000,000.
   Eastern Airlines reported a net 1962 loss of $14,895,365. What's
changed there? In 1987, the airline lost $181.7 million. Standard
of New Jersey had earnings of $84 million; now, as Exxon, its
earnings are $4.84 billion.
   Mary Haworth has left the advice column field to Ann and Abby,
the Nash Rambler has gone the way of the Studebaker, the DeSoto and
the dodo bird, and the United States population has moved
inexorably west and south, so that between 1960 and 1980 its center
moved from 6{ miles northwest of Centralia, Ill., to one-quarter
mile west of DeSoto in Missouri.
   Lunch counters were still closed to blacks when John Kennedy was
in the White House. To vote in most of the South, one had to pay a
poll tax. Drinking fountains were labeled ``white'' and ``colored.''
   In 1988, 6,829 elected officials across the nation are black,
including 301 mayors and 429 judges of state courts. In 43 states,
Martin Luther King's birthday is a holiday.
   Only two of the Supreme Court justices of Kennedy's time,
William J. Brennan and Byron White, still sit on the bench. And
eight men who were serving in the Senate still are there, including
Kennedy's youngest brother, Ted.
   Around the world, a handful of national leaders who were in
power in Kennedy's time remain. Fidel Castro in Cuba, Alfredo
Stroessner in Paraguay, King Hussein in Jordan, and Kim Il-Sung in
North Korea. Bobby Kennedy is gone, but his son is in the House of
Representatives. JFK's son, John Jr., who saluted bravely as his
father's coffin passed, is a strapping, handsome 28-year-old.
   In 1963, 77 percent of American homes had television sets; 98
percent do today. And three out of four homes had telephones; now
93 out of 100 homes have them.
   More than half of all homes have video cassette recorders, which
were virtually unknown then. Radios have multiplied: 156 million in
1963 and 530 million now. There is no change in older folks'
complaints about the younger generation's taste in music.
   Kennedy had committed the nation to going to the moon in the
decade of the '60s, and it did, but when he died only six Americans
had gone into space. Since then, 12 Americans have walked on the
moon and, in all, 208 astronauts have been aboard 57 U.S. space
flights. The Soviets have sent 138 cosmonauts on 65 flights. They
have female astronauts, and so have we.
   In 1963, there was no transplanting of hearts, but there was
cocky confidence that virtually any infection could be controlled
with antibiotics and chemicals. That was before toxic shock
syndrome, Legionnaire's disease and now, the dread AIDS.
   Tempus fugit. John F. Kennedy's beautiful young wife is a
grandmother. The world has changed. The torch, as he said, has
passed.

   In fairy tales, the beautiful princess marries
the handsome prince and they live happily ever after.
   But Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis' fairy tale
short-circuited on a warm day in Dallas when her pink suit was
splattered with her prince's blood. In the ensuing 25 years, she
has had to write her own happy ending.
   The plot twists she has chosen have not been popular with the
adoring multitudes who would have preferred that she remain the
national widow. Her 1968 marriage to Greek shipping tycoon
Aristotle Onassis engendered outrage, and her penchant for privacy
has bred some resentment.
   But once a year, she kneels alone at Arlington National
Cemetery. And once again she becomes the stoic, black-veiled widow
who stood at that spot in November 1963 to bury her husband,
President John F. Kennedy.
   ``One must not let oneself be overwhelmed by sadness,'' she once
said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It is important to remember what Jackie Kennedy was to America
and to the world. She was the glamorous, whispery-voiced brunette
whose appearances caused as much commotion as her husband's _ so
much so that he laughingly introduced himself as Jackie's escort.
   She was the fashion plate whose designer dresses, pillbox hats
and white gloves spurred the fashion industry as much as her
hatless husband wounded the fedora trade.
   ``We are on the threshold of a new American elegance thanks to
Mrs. Kennedy's beauty, naturalness, understatement, exposure and
symbolism,'' said Oleg Cassini, her official designer.
   She was the young hostess of a televised tour of the White
House, the graduate of Miss Porter's School and Vassar who said her
prime responsibility was to ``take care of the president so he can
best serve the people.'' She was 34 years old when JFK died, a
striking contrast to her matronly predecessors, Bess Truman and
Mamie Eisenhower.
   Most of all, she was mistress of Camelot.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   She forfeited that title when she married Onassis, the aging
Greek who seemed the antithesis of the elegant Kennedy. Many said
she was a golddigger; she never explained the marriage publicly,
never responded to such headlines as ``Jackie: How Could You?''
   ``She, by surviving and being with him (JFK) when he died so
dramatically, became a legend in her own lifetime,'' said a friend,
Paul Mathias. ``And she cannot live up to it because no human being
could.''
   The marriage foundered quickly, and Ari and Jackie lived
separate lives. When he died in 1975, he left her $120,000 in his
will; she won a $26 million settlement from the Onassis family.
   At the same time, stories about JFK's escapades while he was
president began to spread _ stories about alleged liaisons with
Marilyn Monroe and the mistress of mobster Sam Giancana. And others
suggested that JFK's most lasting legacy was the war in Vietnam.
   Camelot wasn't what it used to be.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   With her millions, Jackie Onassis could have done absolutely
nothing, enjoying her 14-room apartment on upper Fifth Avenue, her
estate in Bernardsville, N.J., and the oceanfront compound on
Martha's Vineyard while raising her two children, Caroline and John
Jr.
   Instead, she entered the job force in 1978 as an editor for
Doubleday & Co. She works there 3{ days a week _ producing ideas
and acquiring books from authors and agents, then guiding the
writing of manuscripts.
   Her primary publishing interests are art and entertainment,
never politics. Her bestsellers have included Michael Jackson's
autobiography, ``Moonwalk,'' and ballerina Gelsey Kirkland's
``Dancing on My Grave.''
   ``I think people who work themselves have respect for the work
of others,'' she has said.
   Her salary, reportedly $40,000-50,000 a year, is a pittance of
her net worth _ estimated at around $50 million, plus $200,000 a
year from a trust fund bequeathed by Kennedy.
   She has made some public appearances in recent years. She has
supported efforts to save city landmarks like Grand Central
Terminal, attending news conferences but saying little and slipping
out through freight entrances.
   On her infrequent appearances at social galas, she often dons
the designs of Carolina Herrera. Her date is usually longtime
friend Maurice Tempelsman, 58, a Belgian-born diamond dealer and
international businessman.
   On autumn weekends, Mrs. Onassis sometimes rides with the Essex
Hunt Club, near her Bernardsville estate. She often is among the
spectators at the annual steeplechase in nearby Peapack; she does
not mingle with the locals.
   She has been seen sailing and waterskiing off Martha's Vineyard
with Tempelsman, but often eludes the public eye camouflaged in a
scarf and sunglasses. Her island house is at the end of a
2,000-foot driveway.
   The signs out front say ``No Trespassing.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Onassis' battles with paparazzi are legendary. She
repeatedly went to court to thwart the attentions of photographer
Ron Galella, first obtaining a court order barring Galella from
coming within 30 feet of her or her children, then going to court
to enforce that order.
   She declines all interviews, according to her spokeswoman, Nancy
Tuckerman. She would not speak on the 20th anniversary of the
assassination; she will not speak on the quarter-century
anniversary.
   But occasionally, New Yorkers catch glimpses. One newspaper
recently showed Jackie, a still youthful-looking grandmother,
crossing a street while engrossed in a book, oblivious to the
photographer. Even celebrity-immune New Yorkers stare when they
spot her jogging in Central Park or shopping on Madison Avenue.
   ``You have two compartments. Your private and your public
life,'' she once explained. ``I think I'm more of a private person.
I don't really like to call attention to anything.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years after the assassination, after Jackie's fall
from grace with a Greek, after revelations about the Kennedy era
and after her determined efforts to maintain her privacy, a poll
asked Americans to list their most admired first ladies.
   First was Eleanor Roosevelt, the most active of all president's
wives. Second was Nancy Reagan, whose anti-drug campaign was the
stuff of current headlines.
   And third was Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis.

   When John F. Kennedy Jr. took the podium at the
Democratic National Convention in July, the national memory drifted
back nearly 25 years, to the mind's image of a 3-year-old boy
saluting his father's horse-drawn caisson.
   But this was no ``John-John'' on the stage in Atlanta. This was
a darkly handsome, well-spoken law student who would soon be
declared America's sexiest man by a national magazine; this was a
28-year-old millionaire who had traveled the world and worked with
the poor.
   More than a quarter-century has passed since Kennedy and his
sister, Caroline, now 30, charmed the nation with their Oval Office
shenanigans.
   They endured the assassinations of their father in 1963 and
their Uncle Bobby in 1968. They adjusted when their mother married
Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968.
   Still, by all reports John and Caroline thrived _ they did well
in private schools, became proficient in sports, made lasting
friendships and avoided the drugs that so twisted the lives of some
of their cousins.
   Like their mother, both Kennedy children guard their privacy and
decline all interview requests, said family spokeswoman Nancy
Tuckerman.
   Caroline Kennedy earned a fine arts degree at Harvard, then
served as manager and coordinating producer of the office of film
and television at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. She
abandoned a career in photojournalism because other people aimed
cameras at her every time she tried to take pictures.
   She married author-artist Edwin Schlossberg in July 1986. After
a $1,250-a-week internship in 1987 as a summer associate at a New
York law firm, she graduated from Columbia University law school in
May. She gave birth to a daughter, Rose Kennedy Schlossberg, on
June 25.
   Her brother has kept a more public profile.
   Now an athletic 6-foot-1, with matinee-idol good looks, Kennedy
recently was named by People magazine as ``the sexiest man alive.''
   Like his father, Kennedy has been described as extremely shy,
although he did make a few campaign speeches when his cousin,
Joseph P. Kennedy II, ran for Congress.
   Kennedy acted in two productions at Brown University in
Providence, R.I., where he graduated in 1982.
   In the summer of 1985, he starred in a revival of a play called
``Winners,'' staged and directed by his fellow Brown graduates at
the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan. His co-star was Christina Haag,
an actress and his steady girlfriend of the past two years. They
have known each other since they were both 15.
   There have been no theatrical experiences since. ``Acting is
just a hobby,'' he once told a reporter.
   While an undergraduate, Kennedy spent a summer traveling in
southern Africa, where Maurice Tempelsman, his mother's friend, has
mining and manufacturing interests.
   Another summer he worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in
Guatemala. Later, he spent six months working with the poor in
India.
   In 1984, he began his first job, in the New York City Office of
Business Development. He also spent one summer as a $1,100-a-week
intern at a Los Angeles law firm.
   The young Kennedy, who lives in a modest apartment in Greenwich
Village, is a millionaire, thanks to a trust fund left by his
father and the settlement his mother made with the Onassis estate.
   Although he has no personal recollection of the White House days
_ he was only 3 when his father was killed _ he majored in American
history in college, has studied his father's administration and is
a member of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
   Despite speculation about a possible political future, he has
steadfastly denied having any definite career plans beyond New York
University Law School, where he is completing his final year.

<TEXT>
   Television viewers are being offered basically
two ways of marking the 25th anniversary of President John F.
Kennedy's assassination _ as nostalgia or as unsolved mystery.
   The most compelling special is most likely to be the Arts &
Entertainment Cable Network's uninterrupted six hours of NBC news
coverage of the assassination as it appeared on the network 25
years ago. The special even begins on the dot at 1:56 p.m. EST on
Nov. 22 by breaking into regular programming.
   CBS will offer highlights of its coverage, too, in a two-hour
special on Nov. 17.
   NBC and HBO plan commemorative documentaries more about
Kennedy's life than his death. NBC's documentary also examines what
the country was like in the early '60s.
   Investigative reporter Jack Anderson puts forth his conspiracy
theory in a syndicated special _ he says JFK was murdered by hit
men. Geraldo Rivera is host of a replay of the London Weekend
Television production that put Lee Harvey Oswald ``on trial,'' with
a real judge, lawyers and witnesses.
   Here are some of the TV specials on Kennedy and the
assassination, in order of their airing:
   Nov. 2: Jack Anderson's live, two-hour, syndicated special in
which he states flatly that Kennedy was assassinated by
``underworld hit men with connections to the Third World.''
Anderson also asserts the Warren Commission knew and hid the truth.
Anderson, who bases his conclusions on interviews with an
underworld figure now deceased, says he'll interview former
president Gerald Ford, the last surviving member of the Warren
Commission; Marita Lorenz, described as Fidel Castro's mistress,
and former CIA operatives Frank Sturgis and E. Howard Hunt.
   Nov. 6: HBO premiere of its special, ``JFK: In His Own Words,''
featuring never-before-seen film footage and rare audio tapes in
which Kennedy talks about his childhood, his political career and
his presidency. It has additional playdates on Nov. 9, 14, 19, 22
and 25.
   Nov. 6: The Disney Channel presents the first part of ``John
Fitzgerald Kennedy: A Celebration of His Life and Times.'' The
series, created in cooperation with the Kennedy family, is divided
into three sections, the first from Kennedy's birth through his
election to the U.S. Senate. Part two, airing Nov. 13, is called
``The Race for the White House.'' Part three, on Nov. 20, is ``The
Presidency and the Legacy.''
   Nov. 15: PBS' ``NOVA'' science series takes a scholarly look at
the question ``Who Shot President Kennedy?'' Documentary filmmaker
Robert Richter put the theories of conspiracy buffs to present-day
scientific tests. For instance, he says, updated photo enhancement
techniques get a clearer image from a controversial Polaroid
picture taken by a bystander that supposedly showed a gunman on the
grassy knoll near the motorcade route. The picture was previously
considered too blurry to be conclusive.
   Nov. 17: CBS' two-hour special, gleaned from its own 53 hours of
coverage of the assassination, includes the bulletin that
interrupted ``As the World Turns'' at 1:40 p.m. when then-CBS
anchor Walter Cronkite first reported the shooting; the first live
reports from the scene; Dan Rather's exclusive report that the
president had died; Harry Reasoner's tribute to Kennedy; the arrest
and subsequent shooting of Oswald; Kennedy's funeral.
   Nov. 21: PBS' ``JFK _ A Time Remembered'' intersperses archival
footage with present-day reminiscences by Kennedy associates,
reporters and others. Those interviewed include Kennedy aides Dave
Powers, Larry O'Brien and Jack Valenti; reporters Dan Rather, Sarah
McClendon, Sander Vanocur and Tom Wicker, and James Felder, a
bearer of Kennedy's casket in the funeral procession.
   Nov. 22: The Arts & Entertainment Cable Network's ``JFK
Assassination: As It Happened,'' a rebroadcast of NBC's coverage of
the assassination. A&E is running the six-hour special without
commercials. Edwin Newman, a member of the NBC news team covering
the assassination, is the host. Viewers who don't have six hours
can tune in at 6:30 p.m. for a 90-minute wrap-up. The special will
be repeated on Saturday, Nov. 26, beginning at 10:56 a.m.
   Nov. 22: Geraldo Rivera is host of ``On Trial: Lee Harvey
Oswald.'' This is the five-hour mock trial that aired in England
and on Showtime cable in November 1986. U.S. District Judge Lucius
Bunton presided and attorneys Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted the
Manson family, and Gerry Spence, who litigated the Karen Silkwood
case, cross-examined actual witnesses. A jury, selected from Dallas
residents, found Oswald guilty in 1986. This time, viewers can call
a 900 number and register their opinions.
   Nov. 22: NBC's one-hour special, ``A November Journey: Kennedy
Remembered,'' anchored by Tom Brokaw, a retrospective on Kennedy
and his time through archival footage and interviews.

   ``Now the trumpet summons us again _ not as a call to bear arms,

are; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle,
year in and year out, `rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,'
a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty,
disease and war itself. ...
   And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do
for you; ask what you can do for your country.''

   Behind locked doors at the National Archives
sit hundreds of dusty boxes, the product of the House of
Representatives' two-year investigation of the John F. Kennedy and
Martin Luther King Jr. slayings.
   A decade has passed since the House Select Committee on
Assassinations ended its work by concluding that Kennedy and King
were apparently the victims of conspiracies, but the committee
documents, which scholars say would be important research tools,
appear no closer to being opened to the public.
   ``What we're talking about is the records of our political
history _ two of the most important events of the 20th century,''
said Kevin Walsh, a former committee aide who has led a small group
of private Kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records.
   ``This is about the public's right to know.''
   Most of the work conducted by the Warren Commission, which
concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the Kennedy
slaying, has been opened to the public, a move that has helped
researchers evaluate _ and in many cases strongly criticize _ that
investigation.
   But the House committee, the only government investigation to
conclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder, ran out
of money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents.
   Without such a vote, the materials fell under the House's
so-called ``50-year rule,'' keeping congressional documents under
lock and key for a half-century.
   The late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney, R-Conn., a member of the
select committee, had taken up the scholars' cause in Congress,
fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents. But he
died in 1987.
   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, the committee chairman, originally
led opposition to that resolution, but had a change of heart after
McKinney's death, from AIDS, and said he would work for the
information's release.
   That buoyed researchers, but the 1988 legislative session came
and went without any action on the committee documents.
   House counsel Steven R. Ross said he expected Stokes to act next
year on a measure that would immediately open some of the records,
but he declined to provide specifics.
   The committee sent shockwaves around the world in December 1978
when it concluded that Kennedy's killing in 1963 was probably the
result of a conspiracy _ pointing to accoustic evidence that
experts said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman. The
committee also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind the
King slaying in Memphis five years later.
   But in 1982, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that
there was no evidence of a second Kennedy gunman and that the
independent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed a
tape recording made from a motorcycle policeman's open microphone.
The experts' testimony had been the key to the committee's
conclusion; before it, the panel had planned to conclude that there
was no conspiracy.
   Despite the academy study and the Justice Department's final
conclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in either
slaying, Stokes stands by his committee's report.
   ``It's a difference between scientists,'' Stokes said.

<HEAD>After 25 Years, Dallas Finally Able to Open Sixth Floor Assassin's
Perch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After 25 years, Dallas finally has matched courage
with cash and will open the sixth floor of the Texas School Book
Depository to the world.
   Over the decades, the old warehouse has survived arsonists and
calls for demolition. For a time, all buyers shunned it. All this
ill will because of a new young order clerk named Lee Harvey
Oswald, who, perched at a corner window on boxes of ``Rolling
Readers,'' apparently fired two, maybe three, rifle shots at a
motorcade passing below.
   Now workers are just a month away from topping off an outside
elevator that will carry up to half-a-million visitors a year to
the infamous sixth floor, where they can view an exhibit on
President John F. Kennedy and look out that corner window down to
Dealey Plaza.
   It's a $3.5 million project 12 years in the making _ one that
Dallas, for a long time, never wanted for fear of drawing more
attention to a tragedy that heaped shame on the city.
   ``What we are doing is facing up to our history,'' said Lindalyn
Adams, chairwoman of the Dallas County Historical Foundation, who
has made the exhibit a decade-long personal crusade.
   ``The old saying is, `Time heals all wounds,''' said Lee
Jackson, the chief of the county commissioners who made completion
of the Kennedy exhibit a priority in his 1987 inauguration speech.
   ``It's not unusual that sites of tragedy in history only recover
over some period of time, like Gettysburg, or the Alamo, or
Yorktown,'' Jackson said. ``It's taken Dallas 25 years to reach
this consensus.''
   Every day of the year, virtually around the clock, a steady
trickle of tourists and tour buses makes the pilgrimage to Dealey
Plaza and the grassy knoll. They find monuments but then learn they
honor the city's founders.
   They see a 10-sentence plaque on the side of the book
depository. The nine sentences noting the spot where Dallas was
settled are followed by this:
   ``On Nov. 22, 1963, the building gained national notoriety when
Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly shot and killed President John F.
Kennedy from a sixth floor window as the presidential motorcade
passed the site.''
   And then they invariably count six floors up.
   Next Feb. 20, on President's Day, ``The Sixth Floor Exhibit''
will open to the public.
   More than $1 million has been raised privately, with $300,000 to
go. The fundraising effort took years, Adams said, and didn't
really pick up until Jackson made it a county priority.
   ``It's easy to misunderstand what we're doing,'' Mrs. Adams
said. ``There is a feeling among many of us who were living in
Dallas at the time that we'd just as soon not be reminded.''
   To permit construction to begin, the county advanced $2.2
million, which will be repaid through the $4 admission charge.
   The exhibit will be a maze of historical panels tied together
with videos and movies produced by acclaimed filmmaker Martin Jurow
(``Terms of Endearment,'' ``Waltz Across Texas,'' ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's'').
   ``It's far more than an assassination museum,'' Adams said.
``It's about the life of President Kennedy, and his death. It's
about the '60s and what Dallas was like. It puts everything in the
context of American cultural history.''
   The non-profit exhibit will have few actual artifacts _ no
rifle, for example, only an original of the black-bordered
anti-Kennedy ad, headlined ``Welcome to Dallas, Mr. President,''
that appeared in The Dallas Morning News that day, along with a
reporter's notes and an Associated Press teletype machine.
   There will be 400 photographs, many taken by the 22 people who
were photographing the motorcade when the shots were fired.
   The corner window will be sealed by glass panels, although the
actual green-painted window frame was removed by a previous owner.
The spots where Oswald's rifle, three spent cartridges and palm
prints were found will be recreated, based on police photos.
   The building, like Dealey Plaza, is remarkably unchanged from
Nov. 22, 1963.
   The school book brokerage kept its lease in the building for
eight years after the assassination. A Nashville, Tenn., promoter
bought it but failed to raise enough money to convert it into a
Kennedy Museum. Ownership reverted to the previous owner, Dallas
oil and real estate mogul D. Harold Byrd, who then could not sell
the building. Calls for its demolition were turned back because the
city refused to issue a demolition permit.
   In 1977, voters approved a bond package that included $400,000
to purchase the warehouse and convert it _ except for the sixth
floor _ into county office space.
   It is now the Dallas County Administration Building. Jackson's
second-floor office looks out on the spot where Kennedy was shot.
   ``No one can visit this building regularly and fail to be struck
by the number of curious visitors,'' Jackson said. ``And everyone
who works here is aware they're located in a place of unusual
public interest.''
   Over time, Jackson said, Dallas realized the world probably
would never stop coming to Dealey Plaza.
   ``Over time, people finally felt they were able to put the
experience behind them and they felt like the world was no longer
viewing them as a community somehow responsible for the
assassination,'' he said.
   ``Over time, the community has seen that the interest of the
world is permanent and enduring.''

<TEXT>
   ``Where were you, and what was your reaction when
you heard that President John F. Kennedy had been shot?''
   John Jovich, who was 8 years old when he overheard the school
principal whisper news of the shooting to his teacher, recently put
that question to 250 celebrities and assembled their responses into
a book, ``Reflections on JFK's Assassination,'' published by
Woodbine House.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, recalled being near the Senate
chambers and realizing that Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was the
presiding officer. ``I immediately dispatched a page to tell
Senator Kennedy to leave the rostrum for a matter of utmost
emergency. It was then that Senator Kennedy learned of his
brother's shooting.''
   Singer Billy Joel said he first tried to console an eighth-grade
classmate who was crying. He later took a long walk, feeling ``a
deep bitterness and a despair I had never before experienced in my
life.''
   Rona Barrett, the Hollywood columnist, remembers being ``at a
famous Palm Springs racquet club. People came running out of the
clubhouse screaming that someone had shot Jack Kennedy.''
   Roy Rogers said the assassination ``proved to me that we have a
lot more subversive activists in our country than we realize.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter said he had walked into his
warehouse to weigh a load of grain when a group of farmers told him
of the shooting. He said he prayed, and ``wept openly for the first
time in 10 years _ for the first time since the day my own father
died.''
   Novelist Isaac Asimov said all he could think about was ``that I
didn't want Johnson. But I got him.''
   Burt Bacharach said he was working on a song with Hal David when
he found out about the shooting. He said he left the building and
went to a bar, where he eventually got ``into a fight with some
people who were having a good time laughing, etc., totally
disrespectful of the moment.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Accused''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rape has been treated frequently in television movies and in
such films as ``Extremities,'' which featured a remarkable
performance by Farrah Fawcett. What more can be done with this
vital but overworked subject?
   Producers Stanley R. Jaffe and Sherry Lansing, who struck gold
with ``Fatal Attraction,'' have fictionalized a headlined gang rape
and added a degree of cinematic hype. The result is ``The
Accused,'' which has one scene of pure shock and a riveting
performance by Jodie Foster.
   The screenplay by Tom Topor is obviously inspired by the 1983
case of a poolroom-table gang rape in New Bedford, Mass. ``The
Accused'' begins with the half-clad, battered Foster escaping from
a roadhouse, where a college student calls police to report the
ordeal that she has suffered.
   What actually happened in the bar and the game room that night?
Was the young woman brutalized by the boozing men without
provocation? Or was she responsible for inciting them by her dress
and banter? That is the mystery of the film, and it is not solved
until the final minutes.
   The victim, Jodie Foster, falls into the hands of an assistant
prosecutor, Kelly McGillis, who conducts a plea bargain with
attorneys for the accused rapists. Without consulting Foster,
McGillis allows the defendants to plead guilty to a lesser charge,
the equivalent of a judicial rap on the knuckles.
   Foster is understandably furious that her right to vindication
had been traded away without her knowledge. Only when she makes a
scene at McGillis' dinner party does the attorney agree to defy her
male superiors and reopen the case. It seems hopeless until she
locates a convenient law and the key witness.
   Jodie Foster is sensational, invading the skin of the
foul-talking waitress who seems to antagonize everyone who tries to
help her. What prevents ``The Accused'' from being an all-absorbing
film is the character of Kelly McGillis and the subdued manner with
which she plays it. Perhaps it is in the writing or the direction
of Jonathan Kaplan, or maybe she is merely overshadowed by a
remarkable performance.
   Kaplan builds up the suspense to the climactic retelling of the
rape, and it is indeed a horrific sequence. The producers say it
lasts only three minutes. It seems like a punishing half-hour.
   The Paramount release is rated R, with good reason because of
language, nudity and sexual content. Running time: 110 minutes.

   A glistening, half-naked muscleman strikes a
huge gong to signal the beginning of some of cinema's most
cherished products _ the movies from the Rank Organization.
   From the 1940s through '60s, Rank films dominated British
filmmaking with such gems as ``Great Expectations,'' ``Blythe
Spirit'' and ``Brief Encounter.'' The company made stars out of
Dirk Bogarde, James Mason and Jean Simmons.
   Rank stopped making feature movies in 1980. But its treasure
trove of delightful comedies, melodramas and historical epics is
available for the home screen from Paramount Home Video, including
``Doctor in the House'' (1954), ``The Captain's Table'' (1958) and
``Carry on Doctor'' (1968), which is part of the outrageous ``Carry
On'' series. The videos all retail for $19.95 and are unrated.
   ``Doctor in the House,'' starring Bogarde, Kenneth More, Kay
Kendall and James Robertson Justice, tracks the misadventures of
four overage medical school students at St. Swithin's Hospital. One
is determined to flunk out so he can continue collecting an
allowance from his wealthy aunt; another wants only to play rugby;
a third is a womanizer; the fourth just might make a good doctor.
The movie inspired a TV series and several sequels.
   Elsewhere in video news, Vestron Video will release a new
National Geographic series in December: ``The Superliners: Twilight
of an Era,'' in which life aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 is
explored; ``Rocky Mountain Beaver Pond,'' a day in the life of the
frisky and busy little rodent; ``The Secret Leopard,'' the elusive
cat and its habits on the Masai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Gaby _ A True Story,'' ``Frantic,''
``The Unholy.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Gaby _ A True Story'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video;
VHS-Beta, $79.95; Rated R).
   
   ``Gaby _ A True Story'' is a remarkable film based on a
remarkable life.
   Gaby Brimmer was born severely disabled by cerebral palsy, very
intelligent but able to communicate only by moving her left foot.
With the help of a devoted nanny and loving parents, she
perseveres, graduates from college and becomes a successful writer.
Her proud spirit, good humor and insight triumph again and again.
   ``Gaby'' is reminiscent of ``The Miracle Worker,'' especially
because the nanny (Norma Aleando in an Oscar-nominated performance)
is so central to Gaby's emergence from her isolation.
   Rachel Levin is wonderful as Gaby, able to convey a range of
emotions with just her left leg and very limited facial
expressions. Robert Loggia and Liv Ullmann also give excellent
performances as Gaby's parents, who refuse to give up on their
daughter and never fail to show their love.
   Her father says, ``Your foot can write the same words as any
philosopher or poet. I refuse to pity you.'' Such support gives her
the strength to fight and win admission to public school.
   Director Luis Mandoki takes chances and succeeds, dealing
frankly and romantically with sex between disabled people. His film
also is forthright about the frustrations Gaby and a disabled
friend feel. It's easy to recognize her anger when Gaby writes,
typing with her big toe: ``God is a fly on the wall. Nanny, give me
a flyswatter.''
   The movie also succeeds at showing what Gaby has in common with
all young people _ she tries makeup and beer; there's a peace sign
on the back of her wheelchair; she falls in love.
   ``Gaby'' is warm and witty, funny and sweet. It's easy to watch
on a television screen, and well worth seeing.

   ``Frantic'' (Warners Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated R)
   
   ``Frantic'' is a modest Roman Polanski thriller that takes a
plot idea better suited to an hourlong TV drama and pads it into a
two-hour movie.
   Harrison Ford plays an American heart surgeon who arrives with
his wife (Betty Buckley) for a convention in Paris, only to have
her mysteriously abducted from their hotel room while he is in the
shower.
   His desperation and determination to find her lead him into the
Parisian underworld and an unlikely alliance with a young French
girl of dubious morals (Emmanuelle Seigner). She is far-and-away
the most interesting character in the movie and deserves better
than the fate (shades of ``Chinatown'') that she suffers at
Polanski's hands.
   Polanski invites comparisons to the great Alfred Hitchcock with
this story of an ordinary man thrust into peril through no fault of
his own. But the mood of believable, this-could-happen-to-anyone
suspense is shattered after the first half-hour or so and the film
becomes a series of improbable chases and confused confrontations.
   Ford has to carry most of the movie and tries hard, but his
range of expression varies only from extremely anguished to
somewhat anguished.
   All in all, a disappointment from the creator of such original
and unsettling films as ``Knife in the Water,'' ``Repulsion'' and
``Rosemary's Baby.''

   ``The Unholy'' (Vestron Video; VHS-Beta, $89.98; Rated R)
   
   One wonders what Hal Holbrook, Ned Beatty, Trevor Howard and Ben
Cross are doing in a limp horror movie called ``The Unholy.'' The
unemployment lines must be real long in movieland to make such
celebrated and talented actors want to embarrass themselves in the
Camilo Vila film.
   The premise is a good one: A horrific demon exists and can only
be brought down by the purest of mortal souls. However, the
filmmakers cloud the issue with loose ends and vagueness and a
plodding plot.
   The action, such as it is, takes place in New Orleans where two
priests are brutally slain at St. Agnes Church. Enter Father
Michael (Ben Cross). He takes over the parish, resists temptation
from a young woman named Millie who works at a satanic club, is
told by an old blind priest that he is the ``chosen one'' and must
fight a demon.
   So far, so good.
   But then Millie finds a book that talks about a demon called the
Unholy, who preys on the innocent. Millie, an unbelievable virgin,
thinks the demon is after her, naturally. To save her soul, she
thinks she should give herself to Father Michael. Ahem.
   The movie quickly rolls downhill from there culminating in the
bloody and silly clash between Father Michael and the demon.
   It's not a bad diversion for the home screen. But if you're a
fan of the supernatural, you'll want something a little more
devilish.

   ``Close-Up'' (Reprise) _ David Sanborn
   
   The latest offering from David Sanborn is a lot like his other
records _ melodic, upbeat and full of accomplished musicianship.
   But it's jazz for people who don't really like jazz.
   Where jazz is improvisational and daring, Sanborn is arranged
and methodical. Where jazz allows a musician ultimate freedoms from
written music, Sanborn and band are chained to the notes.
   On ``Close-Up,'' Sanborn and his band of crack sidemen plow
familiar ground. Sanborn is an outstanding, albeit unimaginative,
saxophonist, and the record is chock full of his full-steam-ahead
style and catchy hooks.
   He knows how to blow a good riff. On tunes such as ``Slam,''
``Pyramid'' and ``Touch,'' the band lays down a funky,
percussion-filled rhythm track that lets Sanborn pick out the
melody. The songs build to a climax that usually has the leader
hitting a high, solid note and then cascading down the keys.
   Sound familiar? See 1984's ``Straight to the Heart.''
   Other tunes show a glimpse of a slightly different Sanborn.
``Same Girl'' takes on a mournful quality as a duet between
saxophone and piano between Sanborn and Marcus Miller, who wrote or
co-wrote five songs on the record. ``J.T.'' also finds Sanborn in a
lyrical mood, as does ``So Far Away.''
   ``Close-Up'' is cleanly produced and includes such session men
as Nile Rodgers and ``Saturday Night Live'' guitarist G.E. Smith,
who most recently has been touring with Bob Dylan.
   Sanborn never misses a note, and his latest record makes
pleasurable listening. It makes one wish he'd take his considerable
ability out a bit further on the musical fringe.

   ``What A Wonderful World'' (Columbia) _ Willie Nelson
   
   You can pretty much tell from the titles what we're dealing with
here. This time out, Willie covers ``Spanish Eyes'' (with Julio
Iglesias, no less), ``Moon River,'' ``Some Enchanted Evening,''
``To Each His Own'' and six other Revered Standards.
   These songs are pretty, and Willie sings 'em pretty. If you
liked ``Stardust'' and ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' you'll like
this.
   But for those of us who fear that Willie is becoming the Mitch

   ``Back To Avalon'' (Columbia) _ Kenny Loggins
   
   When he's on, Kenny Loggins is capable of creating impressive
pop music, the kind of hook-laden tunes that sound good on car
radios and stubbornly refuse to get out of your mind.
   When he's not, as for most of ``Back to Avalon,'' Loggins deals
in ordinary ``soft rock'' that really drags over an album's length.
   The news here is that ``Back to Avalon'' is Loggins' first album
in three years, during which time he has carved out a lucrative
sideline making hit songs for movie soundtracks.
   Not to go out on a limb too much, the new album includes two of
those cinema tracks _ the bouncy ``Nobody's Fool,'' a recent hit
from ``Caddyshack II,'' and the lush ``Meet Me Halfway'' from the
1987 Sylvester Stallone film, ``Over the Top.''
   Opening and closing the album, respectively, they are easily the
best songs. The rest of the LP flows from one mid-tempo rocker to
another, with breaks for the stately title track and a dance-floor
cover of the oldie ``Tell Her.''
   Loggins also has a visit from the ubiquitous Michael McDonald
for a vocal duet on ``She's Dangerous.'' You've heard this one, or
something like it, before.
   On ``Back to Avalon,'' Loggins sounds comfortable as a singles
artist but stretched to the limit when faced with the demands of an
LP.

   Don Ameche didn't need to go far to research
his role as a poor Italian immigrant who becomes entangled with the
Mafia in David Mamet's new film ``Things Change.''
   ``From the standpoint of knowing the character, I probably never
played one that I knew any better,'' he said. ``My father was born
and raised in Italy, and he didn't come here until he was 25. The
accent was totally his; he had it until the day he died.
   ``Pop was a man of integrity, within the confines of his own
concept of what was right and wrong, the same as Gino in `Things
Change.' So things were easy, as far as knowing what to do with
this character. The only difference is that Gino is Sicilian, and
Pop was from the middle of Italy.''
   Ameche's performance as the ingenious cobbler who manages to
beat the mobsters at their own game drew a best-actor award (shared
with co-star Joe Mantegna) at the Venice Film Festival, and
Columbia Pictures is planning an Oscar campaign for him. The actor
has another major film coming this fall: ``Cocoon: The Return,''
repeating the role that brought him the Academy Award as best
supporting actor of 1985.
   Not bad for an 80-year-old.
   Ameche still looks in wonderment at the events of his so-called
sunset years. He said the Oscar came as a complete surprise.
   ``I didn't believe I would win,'' he recalled. ``Everybody was
saying that Klaus Maria Brandauer would win. I didn't see `Out of
Africa,' but I understand that he was magnificent in the picture. I
was sitting with my oldest son when they announced my name. All I
could say was, `Oh, my God!'
   ``It meant a lot, but nothing like it means today. When I look
at the figure sitting on the living room table, it really means an
awful lot.''
   Ameche could understand the underworld types of ``Things
Change.'' His boyhood was spent in Kenosha, Wis., where his father
operated a saloon frequented by Sicilians.
   ``When I was 7 or 8 years old, I was sitting in an automobile
outside Pop's saloon,'' he reminisced. ``He threw two men out the
front door and down the three stone steps. They wound up a few feet
from me sitting in the car. Both were Sicilians, and the younger
man was beating up the older man. Pretty soon the older man came up
with a knife in his hand, with a blade about that long. He hit the
other man three times in the front and four more times in the back
as he went down.
   ``Once I poured water on an enormously powerful man that Pop had
hit across the shoulders with a baseball bat. We thought he was
dead. I poured gallons of water on him until he revived.
   ``Yes, I saw incredible things in that saloon. I saw it all.''
   After four years of drift in college, Ameche's mellifluous voice
made him a popular actor in Chicago radio. By the mid-1930s,
Hollywood was calling.
   ``I made one test for MGM in August of 1935 that they turned
down,'' he said. ``I saw it, and I hated it _ but then I found out
later that I hated everything I did.
   ``An agent, George Frank was his name, thought he saw something
in my test. He showed it to Darryl Zanuck, who arranged for me to
have a test in New York in December of 1935. In January he signed
me for one picture, `Sins of Man,' with one-year options for seven
years.''
   Ameche settled with his family in Encino, which was a much
different place in 1936: ``Ventura Boulevard was a two-lane
concrete road from Sepulveda Boulevard to where I lived on Louise
Avenue. There may have been 40 stores in that two or three miles.''
The stretch is now a high-rise corridor.
   A versatile actor who was equally at home with musicals,
comedies and dramas, Ameche became Zanuck's busiest star. His most
enduring film was ``Alexander Graham Bell.'' When his film career
waned, he stayed active in other media, returning to the big screen
with Eddie Murphy in ``Trading Places.''
   The once-slick hair has thinned, but Don Ameche remains a
vigorous figure at fourscore. His recipe?
   ``My doctor was a very down-to-earth man with a wonderful
outlook on life,'' he said. ``He was a firm advocate in moderation
in everything. Drink? All right, but be awfully careful of it. He
hated smoking. He recommended exercise, arguing that what did not
grow would atrophy, and he said the same thing about a mind. He
insisted that if you didn't try to stretch the mind, it was going
to atrophy the same as muscles.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Liberated From Chopin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pianist Krystian Zimerman has come a long way
since the days when audiences only wanted to hear him play Chopin.
   At the Nov. 14 Carnegie Hall gala celebrating the 45th
anniversary of Leonard Bernstein's conducting debut with the New
York Philharmonic, he'll be soloist in Bernstein's ``The Age of
Anxiety.'' Next year he'll record all the Beethoven concertos with
Bernstein conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.
   On Dec. 1, Zimerman will perform the North American premiere of
Witold Lutoslawski's ``Piano Concerto'' with the New York
Philharmonic and conductor Zubin Mehta. He played the world
premiere at the Salzburg Festival during the summer with the
composer conducting.
   ``I'm entirely devoted this time to contemporary music,'' the
32-year-old pianist said in an interview. ``I want to show a
different side, because I was usually playing the romantic and
classical repertory.''
   Zimerman has two new recordings out on Deutsche Grammophon, a
Chopin recital, his first Chopin recording in eight years, Liszt's
``Totentanz'' and two concertos, with the Boston Symphony conducted
by Seiji Ozawa.
   DG has a recording of Richard Strauss' ``Sonata in E flat for
Violin and Piano,'' by Zimerman and Kyung Wha Chung, ready to be
released.
   Zimerman was born in Zabrze, Poland. His father, an architect,
started teaching him piano at 5, and soon hired him a teacher.
   ``He was 24; I was 7,'' Zimerman said. ``Today I look back _ I
think it was a blessing I was his first pupil. He didn't have any
fixed idea of how learning should go. I could play the most
difficult pieces because I wanted to play them.
   ``He said OK to the Rachmaninoff `Piano Concerto' when I was 12.
I looked forward so much to play this piece I made progress much
quicker than playing scales.
   ``I had the opportunity to play concerts, which I think is
important for a kid, to know what you're working for. Music doesn't
exist without the person who's listening to it.''
   Zimerman remembers growing up in the communist world. ``There
were not toys for children,'' he said. ``A piano at home was a big
toy. You push a key and the sound is coming, something really
incredible. I spent a lot of time sitting at the piano. We were a
very poor family. I felt somehow rich.''
   He filled in when his father and his musical friends played
chamber music. ``I played all the parts. You look at a score and
you can swallow it immediately. That gives you a very important
skill to play chamber music, which for a pianist is incredibly
important.
   ``A pianist can go through life without playing one note with
anybody else. You can phrase however you like,'' he said. ``Chamber
music puts you back into the right way of controlling yourself. You
can't just fly around with phrases as you like.''
   At 19 he was the youngest of 118 entrants in the 1975 Chopin
Competition in Warsaw. He won.
   ``When you get older, it is more difficult to play in
competitions,'' the pianist said. ``I wasn't aware of many things
and that helped me a lot. My teacher never prepared me to play in a
competition. He said, `You play your music, love the music and
don't care if someone else plays better or not.'
   ``A jurist said to me when I asked him why did he chose me,
`When you started to play, it was like it was fun. We just enjoyed
it.' It is amazing that people can hear anything after 30 pianists.
It is the reason I never want to be on a jury. I would probably
have terrible doubts and gray hair after voting, if it was the
right decision or not.''
   Zimerman's career began after his win, but went slowly for about
four years. He couldn't afford to stay and tour in a town where
he'd played. ``In Paris I wanted to hear other concerts, to be in
this atmosphere. That was extremely difficult. It took awhile until
I was ready to fill the season with so many concerts I could make
my existence and could have time to practice and learn new
repertory.
   ``What helped a lot were recordings and the fact that Bernstein
invited me in 1976 to perform in London,'' he said. ``I think he
got a tape from the competition. In 1979, Claudio Abbado invited me
to his first concert as music director of the London Symphony, to
open the season.
   ``At the beginning, no agent wanted to accept me for anything
but just Chopin,'' Zimerman recalled. ``For almost two years I just
played Chopin recitals. It is beautiful music but it is like having
the same dish all the time.
   ``So I have tried to expand in all possible directions. On my
first recital in America I played some Chopin and some Szymanowski.
He was a great Polish composer nobody plays in the West. He wrote a
lot for piano. It would make about 10 records and every piece is
something.''
   Lutoslawski, who also is from Poland, wrote his concerto for
Zimerman over the last 10 years. ``We were always phoning each
other, meeting and talking about it. It's a beautiful concerto,
solid writing without any tricks.''
   Zimerman is interested in more than music: ``I get 22 monthly
magazines about all the fields of science, psychology and art,'' he
said. ``I try to resist this specializing in a narrow field. If you
look at a tree and know how it grows, you can live more
consciously.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Future of the Stones in Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keith Richards and Mick Jagger were like wedded
jewels in the rock world, two diamonds in the rough who made the
Rolling Stones shimmer for almost three decades.
   Now that union has become a little jagged at the edge: A feud
between the guitarist and the lead singer has left the legendary
group's future in doubt.
   Over the past two years, Jagger has pursued a solo career.
Richards has just come out with his first solo LP, ``Talk Is
Cheap,'' and will give his first solo concert Nov. 29 at the Beacon
Theater in New York.
   ``I tell him he's blowing 20-odd years of integrity of the
Stones because he's got a problem,'' the 43-year-old Richards said
in an interview at his Manhattan office, where pictures of the rock
star line the walls.
   ``I ask him, `What's your problem. What's so tough about being
Mick Jagger?' Suddenly you got to complete and be fashionable. The
Stones don't need that. I love the guy and I love to work with him
but I don't understand this star trip he's on.''
   On his new album Richards has a song especially for his longtime
friend, ``You Don't Move Me.'' It begins like the Stones' ``Honky
Tonk Woman,'' with guitar and drums.
   The lyrics say: ``What makes you so greedy? What makes you so
seedy? Why do you think you got no friends? You drove them all
around the bend.''
   ``The melody and the beat came about like they usually do,''
Richards said. ``Songs come to you; you don't make them. They
decide that they're going to visit for a while.''
   Richards said he wrote the song about Jagger on the advice of
drummer Steve Jordan, who co-produced the LP.
   ``At the time I was going to write it, I just dried up. It was
frustrating me,'' he said.
   ``Steve said to me, `When in doubt, write about Mick.' He's hurt
me a lot and I just had to get it out. It's not entirely about
Mick. It's about anybody that gets disappointed about a friend and
has to let it out. It's a weird mixture of roughness and melody.''
   Richards played ``You Don't Move Me'' for Jagger, who he said
talked all the way through it. But Richards thinks the song will
eventually sink in.
   ``After these interviews, he's probably going to go to a room
and listen to it. He'll make this a mirror for him instead of just
having a mirror for him to look into.''
   Jagger and Richards have known each for nearly 40 years, living
in the same British neighborhood of Dartford for a while as
children, and forming a lasting friendship as teen-agers based on
their mutual interest in blues and rock 'n' roll.
   As Richards tells it, they met on a train around 1960 with
Jagger carrying a pile of blues albums under his arm. Richards was
already playing guitar and Jagger was doing some singing, so they
promptly began rehearsing together.
   They met up with another guitarist, Brian Jones, and shared a
flat in London, starving as Richards recalls, and playing music.
They auditioned for a bassist and decided on Bill Wyman, chosen at
the time more for the large amplifier he owned than for his playing.
   Drummer Charlie Watts, who had played with Jagger in a blues
group, joined the Stones in 1963.
   The Stones began, in Richards' words, as ``young missionaries,''
determined to bring blues music to a mass audience. Their name was
taken from a Muddy Waters song and much of their early material
were covers of blues and soul classics.
   In 1965, ``The Last Time,'' became their first self-written
single to reach the Top 10. Then came, ``Satisfaction,'' No. 1 in
England and the United States and still the Stones' most famous
song.
   They had the best of both worlds for a while. Critics loved the
Stones, naming them ``The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band.''
The fans loved them, not just for their music, but their
belligerent attitude.
   That attitude came at a price. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were
arrested for drugs and briefly jailed. Although the charges were
minor, Jagger for possession of four amphetamine tablets and
Richards for allowing marijuana to be used on his premises, both
were given lengthy sentences and the group's future was in doubt.
   After a public outcry, they were released and the Stones bounced
back in 1968 with the single ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' and the album
``Beggar's Banquet.''
   Jones, however, was suffering from the strain of repeated drug
busts and losing his girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg, to Richards. He
made only a minor contribution to ``Beggar's Banquet,'' and in June
of 1969, announced he was leaving the Stones because of ``musical''
differences. He was found dead in his swimming pool a month later.

   Mick Taylor, a 20-year-old blues guitarist, replaced Jones and
played on some of the Stones' greatest albums: ``Let It Bleed,''
``Sticky Fingers'' and Exiles on Main Street.'' He left the group
in 1974 and his replacement, Ron Wood, is still with the band.
   Wyman once noted that the Stones had always been able to
understand their own abilities and limitations. Jagger was the
singer, Jagger and Richards (and occasionally Wood) the
songwriters, Wyman the bass player and Watts the drummer.
   Unlike their onetime rivals, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones had
each accepted their roles. But Richards sees Jagger's concentration
on his solo career as a departure from that way of thinking.
   ``Mick and I used to pride ourselves on watching these new bands
screw up and make these obvious mistakes. Now it's happened to
us,'' he said.
   What happened was not just Jagger's recording of two solo
albums, but his refusal to tour behind the Stones' most recent LP,
1986's ``Dirty Work.''
   ``I made the record to go on the road and suddenly the rug was
pulled out from under that,'' Richards said. ``He took the Stones
for granted and thought he could just hire another Stones around
the corner.''
   Richards once brushed off the idea of making a solo album,
believing that ``bands splintering up for individual members to
record their own stuff is pointless.'' Why the change of heart?
   ``Because if I don't work I go mad,'' he said. ``At least I fear
I'd go mad. Also, over the last couple of years I found the people
I wanted to work with. People kept asking me to do it.''
   Richards makes no claim to being a `natural' singer, although he
was a soprano in the choir at Westminster Abbey and the Festival
Royal Hall for three years. ``My voice broke and that was that. My
career has gone downhill ever since,'' he said.
   But he has a way of putting across a song.
   Richards has a generous supply of friends on hand for ``Talk is
Cheap'': bassist Bootsy Collins and keyboardist Bernie Worrell of
Parliament-Funkadelic fame, producer Willie Mitchell and the
Memphis Horns, session guitarist Waddy Wachtel and many others.
   Mick Taylor is also on the record, playing on ``I Could Have
Stood You Up,'' a song that shows Chuck Berry's influence on
Richards. Berry's longtime keyboardist, Johnny Johnson, plays on
the cut.
   Richards met Johnson during ``Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,'' the
critically acclaimed concert film on Berry.
   It's been 30 years since Richards first heard Berry and became
his most famous fan. The Rolling Stones' first single was a cover
of Berry's ``Come On.'' The Stones also recorded ``Carol,'' ``Let
it Rock,'' ``Around and Around'' and several other Berry songs.
Originals such as ``Brown Sugar'' and ``Star Star'' are openly
patterned after Berry's music.
   Richards said exposing Berry and other black artists to white
audiences was the primary reason the Stones were formed.
   ``We were idealistic,'' he said. ``The initial reason for
putting the band together was not to make the Rolling Stones stars.
We just wanted to turn people on to Muddy Waters and Jimmy Reed. We
figured if we could play stuff good enough then other people would
want to know where we got it.''
   Ironically, the Stones developed a sound so distinctive that
listeners were often unaware where such songs as ``Time Is on My
Side'' and ``It's All Over Now'' came from.
   But now the Stones are struggling to continue. The early
obstacles no longer exist: They no longer have the Beatles to
compete with; their days as rock's ``bad boys'' are long gone.
   ``It can certainly be pulled back together,'' Richards said.
``The positive side is the stuff I've learned the last two years _
just having that breather, some fresh air.''
   Wood has favored a reunion all along. Wyman has suggested the
group call it quits. Jagger, struggling with his solo career, has
said he'd like to record with the Stones again. Watts has left it
for the others to decide.
   Richards is optimistic: He sees another Stones album coming out
in 1989.

<TEXT>
   Isabel Allende is a storyteller. ``Eva Luna,''
her third novel, is the story of a storyteller.
   ``I come from a long order of tradition,'' Allende said in a
recent interview. ``I used to listen to the maid and cook tell
stories in the kitchen. I loved that. I've read stories since I was
very little. I grew up with storytelling.''
   ``Eva Luna'' (Knopf, $18.95) takes place in a Latin American
country closely resembling Chile. The title character is orphaned
as a child and grows up poor, working as a domestic. But she soon
discovers she can earn a living by telling stories.
   ``I never realized it was something that I had and that I could
trade for something else,'' Allende said. ``Like Eva Luna, I
realized when I was 40 that I had been trading stories for other
goods and making a living of it.''
   Storytelling, the author explained, is a way of preserving
memory. Since leaving Chile after the 1973 military coup, she has
struggled to remember the environment that shaped her as a child.
   ``I realized about myself that I have lost something that was
invisible, that I could not put in words,'' said Allende, who
became a resident of Caracas, Venezuela. ``The only word I could
think of was roots. It's memory.''
   And what Allende misses goes beyond specific sights and sounds.
Living in a foreign country, she struggles for a sense of identity.
   ``If you walk in your own city, in your own country with your
people, you hear the language of your own country. You have the
feeling that somehow you know the subtle rules and you know how to
get along.
   ``When you're taken away from that, you don't belong anywhere.
You're all by yourself, you have no roots and the memory of the
past starts fading away.''
   So Allende uses her stories to keep the past alive.
   ``I have the feeling I have lost my family, my country, my
friends, the accent of my own language,'' she said. ``But very
specifically, the memory _ something that had been with me
naturally. Now I'm reconstructing every day. Now it's finally mine,
it's printed, portable. I can take it with me.''
   Allende, whose father was a diplomat, was born in 1942 in Lima,
Peru, but moved to Santiago, Chile, at the age of 3. She lived
comfortably as a child and was spared the poverty under which so
many in her country lived.
   ``I grew up in a world on contrasts _ extreme wealth and extreme
poverty,'' she said. ``I belonged to the bubble. That means I've
been fortunate, but I was also aware of that inequality. Though I
was always touched by that, I never came to terms with it until the
military coup.''
   She married an engineer when she was 19 and had two children.
She supported the government of Salvador Allende, a Socialist
elected president in 1970. (The author says she's a distant
cousin). He was overthrown by the military in 1973 and executed.
After Gen. Augusto Pinochet took over and declared a state of
emergency, he tortured and murdered political opponents and
censored the press.
   Allende, a journalist at the time, recalled the day of the coup:
``I left my house very early in the morning and I went to my job. I
saw only soldiers passing in tanks and airplanes and everybody
hiding in their homes. I saw the bombing of the (President's)
palace. That very day, I had the feeling my whole life was
changing.''
   She was an outspoken opponent of the regime and went into exile
in 1975, leaving her family behind. They were later reunited.
   ``When I learned I could be taken into prison with my children
and have them tortured in front of me, it became unbearable. I had
to leave,'' she said.
   Her first novel, ``House of the Spirits,'' was released in 1982
and combined her strong political beliefs with ``magic realism,'' a
writing style associated with such Latin American writers as
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
   ``You can not be an artist for the sake of art only in Latin
America,'' she said. ``I would say the same goes for any country in
the world where there is great repression and violence.''
   Magic is also essential. Allende writes in Eva Luna:
   ``I was writing a new episode every day, totally immersed in the
world. I was creating with the all-encompassing power of words,
transformed into a multifaceted being, reproduced to infinity,
seeing my own reflection in multiple mirrors, living countless
lives, speaking with many voices.''
   And magic also is part of her roots: ``It's a combination of
legends, superstitions, myths. The Indian culture, the African
culture. The dreams of the Spaniards who came here. The possibility
of finding Utopia.''
   Allende's second novel, ``Of Love and Shadows,'' came out in
1987, and had the same themes of good and evil, darkness and light,
that appear in all her works.
   She balances Eva Luna's passionate love affairs with the
violence and oppression of the outside world.
   ``I think that I'm surrounded by violence, shadows, confusion,''
the author said. ``Writing is maybe a naive attempt to make the
world more comprehensible, more tolerable.
   ``Shadows for me are all those things that are threatening and
have always been there, are still there. Death, repression, abuse,
inequality, mystery _ things in which I'm immersed, constantly.''
   Allende is divorced from her first husband and recently married
a San Francisco lawyer. With Chileans rejecting the presidency of
Pinochet in a recent plebescite, she will visit the country in
December.
   ``I froze a country 15 years ago and took it with me,'' she
said. ``When I go back, I won't know where I'll belong. Who will be
my friend when I go back?''
   But no matter what, Allende will go on telling stories.
   ``Eva Luna can not only trade the stories, she can make her life
better and others around her. She makes the world more tolerable.
That's what I try to do all the time.''

   Irlene Mandrell, the youngest of the
performing Mandrell sisters, believes she'll always be overshadowed
by her two versatile siblings.
   But she's the only one seen weekly on television. She's in her
fourth season on ``Hee Haw,'' the syndicated hour-long program of
country music and corn pone humor.
   All three starred in the NBC variety show,``Barbara Mandrell and
the Mandrell Sisters,'' which ran for two seasons ending in 1982.
Now country music singer Barbara Mandrell is seen periodically on
television specials while the remaining sister, Louise, is seen
primarily in a TV shampoo commercial.
   Irlene Mandrell, in an interview between tapings on the ``Hee
Haw'' set, said her sisters are tough acts to compete against.
   ``Barbara and Louise are great showmen,'' she said. ``It would
be hard to top them.''
   But she's moving in that direction with her comic sketches on
``Hee Haw,'' which is in its 21st season as one of the longest
running TV shows in history.
   On the program, Irlene's featured segments show her as a
telephone operator and a highbrow society figure, Beatrice Meadows
Watson, also known as BMW.
   As the telephone operator, Irlene is scatterbrained much like
her character on the old network Saturday night variety show.
   ``People are always commenting about the spot, `I hope I don't
get you as an operator. The call would never get through,''' she
said.
   ``It's fun to do,'' she said. ``You get to dress different and
use a different accent.''
   She also appears regularly in segments set in a general store
and truck stop.
   Her tenure on the program is a return engagement of sorts.
Twenty years ago, she was on the show as a drummer in Barbara's
band.
   When not busy taping ``Hee Haw,'' Irlene makes personal
appearances, does some emcee work and appears occasionally with her
sisters at concerts. At those shows, mostly at conventions, she
opens the act by singing a number or two. Then Louise sings and
plays her fiddle, followed by a segment by Barbara before all three
join together.
   ``There's some slapstick like on the old (network) show,'' she
said. On that program, she often was portrayed as the dippy sister
in comedy spots.
   ``I guess they thought I'm a little dingy,'' she said. ``I miss
the show a lot. We really liked to work together. I miss them.''
   After the show went out of production, Irlene had two acting
roles in the ``Love Boat'' series. She also did some dancing and
singing on a road show with the Marty Krofft puppets, who had been
featured regularly on the variety show.
   Serious acting, though, is a career ambition. ``I love comedy
and I'm trying to get more involved in drama. I'm capable of it.
Anything that came up, I could handle.''
   But for the past two years, career moves have been delayed by
motherhood.
   ``I end up pregnant every time something is happening,'' she
said. ``The last few years I've been mainly mothering which I love.
They are No. 1, second only to God.'' Deric is 2, and Vanessa is
about 1.
   Irlene was born into a musical family in Corpus Christi, Texas.
She was raised in Oceanside, Calif., until the Mandrells moved to
Nashville when she was about 12.
   ``Barbara was special, even in grade school,'' she recalled.
``To me she's always been a superstar. I remember our grandmother
used to tell us not to pound on the piano, but she could tell even
then that Barbara had musical talent.
   ``Barbara and Louise are both honest, soft hearted and
wonderful.''
   Barbara still does concerts and performs periodically in Las
Vegas while maintaining a recording career. Louise, meanwhile,
recently has been the opening act for comedian George Burns.
   The careers of all three are managed by their father, Irby, a
former singer and guitarist. Their mother also is a former musician.
   Sam Lovullo, producer of ``Hee Haw,'' said Irlene has done well
on the long running program.
   ``She came from a show where it focused on three people. She's
adapted well with the `Hee Haw' gang.''

   As many as 6 percent of Americans may be so
obsessed with sex it interferes with their lives, but experts can't
agree how to treat these ``sex addicts'' _ or even if they're
addicts.
   Eli Coleman, a pioneer in the field, says there's no question
that sexual addiction exists, and that his patients include men who
are ``masturbating 10 to 15 times a day resulting in physical
injury, hiring prostitutes on a daily basis, (or having) multiple
anonymous sexual encounters without any regard to risk of health or
commitments to family or relationships.''
   The concept has become increasingly popular in recent years,
spurring the creation self-help groups modeled after Alcoholics
Anonymous. Mary Ann Miller, a psychologist who founded the Chicago
chapter of Sex Addicts Anonymous, has estimated that up to 6
percent of Americans are addicts.
   However, sociologists Martin P. Levine and Richard Troiden wrote
in the August issue of the Journal of Sex Research that the sex
addict theory amounts to ``transforming sin into sickness.''
   ``There's no such disease as sexual addiction or sexual
compulsion. It doesn't exist,'' said Levine, at Bloomfield College
in New Jersey. ``You can't be addicted to sex. Addiction is a
physiological dependency on a substance.''
   He and Troiden, of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, wrote that
``the invention of sexual addiction and sexual compulsion as
`diseases' threatens the civil liberties of sexually variant
peoples'' like homosexuals.
   ``Mental health professionals must remain cautious about
endorsing concepts which may serve as `billy clubs' for driving the
erotically unconventional into the traditional sexual fold,'' they
cautioned.
   While not addictive in the chemical sense, ``these behavior
patterns are pathological, self-defeating,'' said Coleman, a
psychologist in the University of Minnesota Medical School's human
sexuality program. ``These individuals display hypersexuality in
response to feelings of anxiety, depression or loneliness. Many
describe a sexual act as a `fix' to some very negative feeling. But
this relief is short-lived and negative feelings recur.''
   Dr. Theresa Crenshaw, a San Diego physician and sex therapist
who served on President Reagan's AIDS commission, said the sex
addicts she treats ``want help. They don't like the behavior. It is
not ordinarily a diagnosis superimposed from the outside...
   ``It's a compulsive behavior pattern the person continues to
repeat in spite of disruption to marriage or primary relationships,
in spite of self-disgust.''
   Levine said self-help groups like Sex Addicts Anonymous and
Sexaholics Anonymous simply try ``to shut down the sexual behavior
and not deal with the underlying problem'' for those who are
unhappy because their frequent sexual behavior violates moral
standards.
   ``It used to be that people said, `The devil made me do this.'
Now they say, `My disease made me do this.' If you enter the role
of being a sick person, you're not responsible for the behavior, he
said.
   ``The treatment is to get them to repress their sexuality _
restrict their sexual experience only to an emotional relationship,
preferably marriage. The problem is it doesn't deal with the
underlying forces that make them feel so worthless about themselves.
   ``It's their sense of worthlessness that pushes them to engage
in sexual behavior that violates their values. If you remove that
behavior, you remove the only comfort or antidote they have for
their misery.''
   Coleman said he and other sexual addiction therapy pioneers
agree that underlying feelings of worthlessness must be treated,
and that ``none of them advocate simply suppression of sexual
behavior.''
   Treatments such as the 30-day sexual dependency program at
Golden Valley Health Center near Minneapolis ``help people learn
how to be sexual in healthy ways,'' while self-help groups let sex
addicts know they aren't alone and encourage members to obtain
professional therapy, said Coleman, who lectures there.
   But ``there is no unanimity of treatment,'' he said. ``Some view
this as a psychiatric conditon and treat it with medications.
Others treat it with psychoanalytic or behavioral therapy. Others
adapted the methods of treating alcohol addiction.''
   Levine said the sex addiction-compulsion concept ``appeals to
most Americans because ... if you're engaging in behavior that
traditionally has been defined as sin, transforming it into a
disease absolves you of any moral failing.''
   Coleman insisted that sex addicts who seek treatment are
accepting responsibility, and self-help groups ``do not relieve
them of responsibility, but they do try to relieve them of shame.''
   Levine said when a disease-like label like sex addict is applied
to people they can be forced to get treatment, and that the notion
of addiction can be used to justify attacks on homosexuality and
other sex outside of marriage.
   A person's sexual behavior should be considered a problem only
if it makes them unhappy, involves an unwilling partner or directly
harms others, he said.
   Coleman acknowledged that resarchers ``do not have any objective
criteria to say who is sexually compulsive or addictive,'' so such
labels ``could be used as a measure of sexual oppression of sexual
minorities.''
   Levine and Troiden view the notion of sexual addiction as a
product of increasingly conservative American values, a backlash to
the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, the upsurge in
Christian fundamentalism, increased emphasis on monogamy and
commitment, and fear of AIDS, herpes and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
   Hypersexuality ``was a psychological and medical issue long
before it was politicized by those who feared it could be
misapplied to them,'' Crenshaw said. Some homosexual men resist the
notion of addiction because it threatens what they consider their
right to anonymous sex with multiple partners, she added.
   Levine said his own homosexuality didn't influence his opinion.
The term sexual compulsion was coined by homosexual therapists to
explain why some gay men continued to engage in unsafe sex with
multiple partners despite the deadly threat of AIDS, he added.
   ``The points Levine and Troiden raise are reasonable ones,''
said Paul Abramson, editor of the Journal of Sex Research and a
psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.
   Abramson said their essay ``will force a re-evaluation of the
concept of sexual addiction and compulsivity. This article has
engendered a lot of debate about the feasibility of using such a
label for the purpose of maligning a sexual lifestyle.''

<HEAD>Television Viewing Contributes to Record Number of Obese
Youngsters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Americans are more overweight than
ever, a ``fattening of America'' that one researcher blames on a
generation of couch potatoes that spends as much time watching
television as in the classroom.
   Rates of obesity among children and adolescents went up an
average of about 45 percent between 1960 and the early 1980s, said
Steven Gortmaker, associate professor and acting chairman of the
Department of Behavioral Sciences at Harvard University.
   A key factor in explaining the rise are 1983 studies that show
children spend an average of at least 25 hours a week in front of
the television, said Gortmaker, who speculated that the actual
number of viewing hours is higher.
   ``Television viewing for children is now practically a full-time
job equal to the time spent in school,'' he said, adding that
television viewing is up from an average of 18 hours per week in
1968.
   Diet, a general decline in physical activity, and TV commercials
that reinforce the appeal of high-calorie foods contribute to the
dramatic increase in overweight youths, said Gortmaker, who
explained his ``couch potato hypothesis'' last month at an American
Dietetic Association meeting.
   The link between TV-watching and obesity rates holds true for
adults, too, he said. One study showed that adults who watch an
hour of television a day or less have a 3 percent chance of being
obese, compared to a 25 percent chance of obesity among adults who
watch three hours per day.
   Specifically, Gortmaker found that between the late 1960s and
1980, obesity rates went up 54 percent among children aged 6 to 11.
Super-obesity rates went up 98 percent in the same age group. Among
youths aged 12 to 17, obesity went up 39 percent and super-obesity
rose by 64 percent.
   Obesity and super-obesity were measured with a skinfold test
that does not readily translate into percentage of body fat or
other measurements, he said.
   The greatest increase among males was between the ages of 6 and
11, and the biggest among females was in those aged 12 to 17.
Obesity was less prevalent among blacks than whites, but that gap
has narrowed recently, he said.
   Obesity is equally prevalent among wealthy and poor children,
Gortmaker found. The greatest number of obese youths are found in
the Northeast while the fewest are west of the Mississippi River.
   Obese children face health risks including hypertension,
psycho-social damage, respiratory and orthopedic problems. They
also tend to become overweight adults, Gortmaker said.
   To counter the trend, he recommended individualized programs to
target overweight youth, and school and community-based nutrition
programs.
   In another presentation, John Foreyt, an associate professor at
Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, reported that dieting has
become the norm among American women and has become common among
young children.
   ``We have become a nation obsessed with body shape, body size.
Women in particular are not satisfied with their bodies today,
either size or shape,'' he said. ``It's not uncommon to see
children in second, third and fourth grade begin to abnormally
restrict their caloric intake.''
   One study revealed that a group of well-meaning parents, fearful
that their infants would become obese, actually caused nutritional
dwarfing in their babies by restricting their food intake.
   Although the average American man would like to lose one pound,
the average woman wants to lose eleven pounds, he said.
   ``Why is this? We today have the first generation of girls
growing up whose mothers had tremendous pressures to diet.''
   Popular images, including beauty queens and models, feature
women who typically weigh only 82 percent of average body weight,
Foreyt said, warning that such images can have harmful
psychological effects on women who compare themselves to these
``very, very skinny women.''
   Chronic dieting, ``cycling,'' can lead to harmful food
obsessions, emotional problems including depression, anxiety and
withdrawal, and physical changes from sleep disturbance to lowered
metabolic rate that can inhibit weight loss.
   Foreyt urged health care professionals to address the underlying
psychological issues, eating habits and unattainable goals that
contribute to chronic dieting, and said, ``Mild obesity in women
does not constitute a health risk for women.''

<HEAD>Archaeological Research Underway At Hanford Nuclear Reservation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists are starting to study
Wanapum and Palouse villages up to 2,500 years old, and more modern
non-Indian settlements, that have been preserved largely because of
national security.
   The 126 archaeological sites _ 20 of them non-Indian _ lie
within the 570-square-mile Hanford reservation that makes fuel for
nuclear weapons.
   ``It's an irony that the protection offered Hanford because of
its national defense role allowed these sites to be protected,''
said James Chatters, who was hired last year as the first Hanford
archaeologist.
   ``The majority of archaeological deposits throughout this region
have been destroyed or covered by hydroelectric development,
agricultural activities and domestic and industrial construction,''
Chatters said as he crouched inside a stone hunting blind created
by Indians thousands of years ago.
   The heavy security that kept the public out of the sprawling
federal plutonium production site for more than 40 years also
preserved a collection of Indian villages, cemeteries and artifacts.
   The arid Hanford site was once home to 3,000 Wanapum and Palouse
Indians, who lived along the Columbia River and stalked deer and
salmon. They went to reservations and up to 2,000 whites moved in
at the turn of the century. But the area remained largely empty
until the government created the nuclear reservation in 1943 as
part of the Manhattan Project.
   Officials for Battelle's Pacific Northwest Laboratories, which
contracts most Hanford research, recently arranged the first press
tour of archaeological sites. Reporters were taken to the remains
of a large Indian village and to the hunting blind, essentially a
round stone hiding place built into the side of a canyon where
hunters waited to kill passing deer.
   They are among the most dramatic remains of 10,000 years of
human activity in the area, said Chatters, who is developing a plan
to manage and preserve the sites. ``There are probably more intact
archaeological sites here than anywhere else in the U.S. The
majority of the sites don't seem to have been disturbed.''
   Perhaps the most important discovery was the site of a large
Wanapum Indian village, which at one time had at least 60 housepits
and may have been occupied for 2,500 years, he said. It is one of
the two largest in the Northwest, along with the Strawberry Island
site at the mouth of the Snake River.
   The village is now a series of circular depressions, overgrown
with weeds, along with tool fragments, animal bones and other signs
of human habitation.
   The homes were pits dug into the ground and covered with wood
and mat roofs, averaging about 400 square feet and sheltering
around a dozen people, Chatters said. There has been no excavation
of the site yet.
   Hanford was where the Wanapum prophet Smohalla held the first
``washat'' dance, which became central to the ``Washane'' religion
still practiced by some Indians on the nearby Colville, Nez Perce,
Umatilla, Warm Springs and Yakima Indian reservations, Chatters
said.
   But the same security that kept out looters also kept area
tribes from sacred religious sites. Those restrictions have eased
with the end of plutonium production, and negotiations are under
way for more access.
   While part of Chatters' job is advising the Department of Energy
on Indian concerns, the tribes do not fully support his work.
``We're seen as gravediggers by the Indians,'' he said.
   Non-Indian sites include the former townships of White Bluffs,
Hanford and Ringold, whose residents were turned out of their homes
in the 1940s in a parallel with the Indian relocation a few decades
earlier.
   Also, Chatters said, the nine reactors that produced plutonium,
including the material for the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki, are
historic. The B Reactor, the first at Hanford, is being considered
for preservation and development as a national historic site.
   ``Our purpose is not to judge the social or political merits of
what we're preserving,'' he said. ``The reactor's importance is
much greater than the hunting blind's, which fed a few families.''

as likely as non-smokers to develop colorectal cancer in a recent
study.
   This doesn't mean women should light up, because the decreased
risk is outweighed by health harm from smoking, researchers said.
   The study does provide new evidence, however, that the female
hormone estrogen plays a role in colorectal cancer, they said.
   Previous studies suggested smoking interferes with estrogen
function and that estrogen levels might be linked to the risk of
colorectal cancer. Better understanding of estrogen's role could
lead to new treatments, researchers say.
   For the new study, researchers looked back at the records of
25,369 white women whose smoking status was known in 1963 to see
how many had developed colorectal cancer by 1975.
   The colorectal cancer risk for 4,338 smokers who were 65 or
older in 1963 was estimated to be 42 percent of that of their
nonsmoking counterparts. Smokers younger than 55 ran an elevated
risk.
   The work is reported in the Oct. 19 Journal of the National
Cancer Institute by researchers from the Johns Hopkins University
School of Hygiene and Public Health in Hagerstown, Md., the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill and
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Research
Triangle Park, N.C.

<HEAD>Children of Diabetic Mothers May Get Partial Protection From</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Children of diabetic mothers may have some
protection against developing diabetes themselves because of their
exposure to the mother before birth, a study suggests.
   Their immune systems may be affected before birth in a way that
makes them less likely to develop diabetes than children of
diabetic fathers are, the study's authors say.
   The study dealt with insulin-dependent diabetes _ the kind that
requires daily insulin shots.
   Children of diabetic mothers run a higher diabetes risk than
those of normal mothers, but by one estimate they are only a
quarter as likely to develop diabetes as are children of diabetic
fathers.
   Until recent decades, children of diabetic mothers were more
likely to be stillborn or die as newborns than were children of
diabetic fathers. Some researchers had speculated the early deaths
may have culled out children who would later have developed
diabetes, thus lowering the diabetes rate among survivors.
   But the new study found no support for that speculation, because
it showed that the rate of such early deaths in 1,602 pregnancies
was unrelated to the diabetes rate in the survivors.
   Researchers cited an alternative explanation for the lowered
diabetes rate. Insulin-dependent diabetes occurs when the body's
disease-fighting immune system attacks insulin-producing cells of
the pancreas. Perhaps something in a diabetic mother enables the
fetal immune system to avoid such an attack, the researchers say.
   The study was done by James Warram, Andrzej Krolewski and C.
Ronald Kahn of Boston's Joslin Diabetes Center and was published in
the October issue of the journal Diabetes.

<HEAD>Tubes Or Not Ear Tubes, That Is the Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New studies cast doubt on the value of
surgically installed ear tubes to relieve fluid buildup in children
with middle-ear infections.
   The surgery, which costs about $1,000, has surpassed
tonsillectomy as the most common operation on U.S. children. But
pediatricians are divided about the operation's safety.
   ``The adverse consequences may be significant compared to
treatment with antibiotics,'' Dr. Michael Pichichero, of the
University of Rochester, N.Y., said during the recent 28th
Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.
   He studied more than 100 children, about half of whom received
six or more treatements with antibiotics and half of whom had
received three or more sets of ear tubes for recurrent middle-ear
infections.
   Roughly 50 percent of the ear-tube group experienced some
hearing loss _ a worrisome consequence of middle-ear infections.
Less than 5 percent of the antibiotic group showed hearing loss.
Pichicherio doesn't yet know whether the hearing loss will be
permanent. The ear-tube group also suffered eardrum damage far more
often.
   Doctors at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem, Israel,
treated 105 babies under age 1, using antibiotics, ear tubes or
both. After 10 days, they found infection persisted in 63 percent
of the babies who had surgery, 11 percent of the babies who
received antibiotics and 13 percent of the babies who got both
treatments.
   However, there are cases in which there is no alternative to ear
tubes, including those where children are allergic or unresponsive
to antibiotics, or have had fluid in an ear for three or more
months, Dr. Charles Bluestone, a Pittsburgh ear-nose-throat
specialist, said during the recent American Academy of Pediatrics
meeting in San Francisco.

   The Christmas tree has its roots firmly
planted in the fertile soil of American tradition, nostalgia and
the Ellipse south of the White House.
   Official lighting ceremonies for the living Colorado blue spruce
will be held Dec. 15 this year, with President and Mrs. Reagan
expected to preside for their final time.
   Transplanted from Pennsylvania a decade ago, it is known
officially as the National Community Christmas Tree and serves as
the focus of the annual Pageant of Peace.
   In addition to that national Christmas tree, a variety of
smaller trees will mark the holiday season in the capital city.
   The National Christmas Tree Association is maintaining tradition
by supplying a tree for the White House.
   The national grower's group condcts an annual contest with the
winner getting to send a tree to the Executive Mansion.
   This year the tree is coming from Snowcrest Tree Farms in
Montello, Wis., operated by Irv Daggett.
   A score of other trees including those at the Capitol are
provided by the U.S. Forest Service.
   The centerpiece tree for the Capitol this year will be a 50-foot
balsam fir scheduled to be cut Nov. 26 in the Manitee National
Forest in Michigan. Lighting of that tree will be Dec. 14, on the
West Lawn of the Capitol.
   The Forest Service will also provide trees for the Supreme
Court, House and Senate dining rooms, Department of Agriculture and
a variety of other federal agencies.
   The lighting of a national Christmas tree began only with
President Calvin Coolidge in 1923, but having such a tree in the
White House goes back at least to Franklin Pierce in 1856.
   Theodore Roosevelt once tried to discourage the use of Christmas
trees, fearing that their popularity would deplete the forests.
   But the tradition, older than the nation itself, continues.
   Indeed, it likely stems from tree-worshiping religions that
flourished in central Europe thousands of years ago.
   Use of greenery indoors at festival times has been reported from
the Roman era, but the first instance of Christmas Trees was seen
in the 1600s in Germany, coming to this country with the many waves
of immigrants from that nation.
   In addition to trees, popular seasonal decorations include
holly, ivy, mistletoe and, on occasion, nearly any other green
plant that can symbolize faith in the coming of spring.
   One custom apparently English in origin and currently widely
popular is kissing under mistletoe. The ancient Druids and Norsemen
long considered this plant to have magical qualities, expecting it
to cure some diseases, promote fertility, nullify poison and avert
misfortune.

   Rockefeller Center was still a muddy
construction site when Christmas was first celebrated around its
now-famous tree.
   That was in 1931, in the midst of the Depression, when
construction workers happy to be employed got their Christmas Eve
paychecks around the tree they had set up in the dirt.
   Two years later, the formal tree lighting tradition at the
midtown Manhattan site began when the tree was decorated with 700
lights and placed in front of the then-8-month-old RCA Building. In
1936, the Rockefeller Plaza outdoor ice skating rink was opened.
   This year's tree lighting, with more than 18,000 multicolored
lights, takes place at 5:30 p.m. Dec. 5 and will be nationally
televised later that evening.
   The tree is a 75-foot Norway spruce from Raritan Township, N.J.
   Other Christmas attractions at Rockefeller Center are the
display of trumpeting angels in the adjacent Channel Gardens and
the ``TubaChristmas'' concert, set for Dec. 11.
   The Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall runs from Nov. 11
through Jan. 4.

   Christmas season brings a special cheer each
year to more than 100 unemployed people in the Appalachian
foothills of Jackson County _ a warm, happy feeling that comes from
receiving a long-awaited paycheck.
   The small army of jobless workers descends on the Christmas
Ridge Handcrafts factory near the community of Tyner every year in
late October. They man an assembly line until mid-December making
thousands of natural pine and fir wreaths for shipment across the
country.
   ``It gives them an opportunity to buy things at Christmas for
their children and grandchildren that they might not otherwise
have,'' says Carol Parrett, quality control chief at the factory,
operated by the non-profit Christian Appalachian Project (CAP).
   Unemployment in the southeastern Kentucky county has hovered
well above the 10 percent mark for most of 1988, peaking at 18.5
percent in February.
   Ms. Parrett says most workers in the wreath factory are women,
many of whose husbands and sons must travel 40 to 80 miles out of
the mountains to find work in larger towns.
   Bernie Hale, marketing director for the factory, says Christmas
Ridge Handcrafts plans this year to produce about 65,000 wreaths
that sell at between $13 and $30. The factory, in three old school
buildings, shipped about 51,000 wreaths in 1987, he says.
   ``The income from the wreath business is put back in to help
create more jobs for the area,'' says Hale.
   He said about $1 million the factory is projected to earn this
year would go to support other CAP craft businesses.
   Ms. Parrett says the wreath factory began more than 20 years
ago, when about 10 women put together the decorations in an
unheated tobacco barn a local farmer allowed them to use. Output
and employment has grown steadily each year since then.
   Production of the wreaths begins with bending wire, about the
same gauge as used in thick clothes hangers, into 10-inch hoops.
After wire clasps are spot-welded onto the hoops, workers attach
ample helpings of fir or pine and the thick green wreaths begin to
take shape.
   The unfinished wreaths then are placed on tobacco sticks in a
storeroom until another crew places bows, pine cones and artificial
cranberries on them and slides the completed products into shipping
boxes. The finished wreaths measure 22 inches across and are 4
inches thick.
   Although the factory used Kentucky pine for many years, Hale
says most of the evergreen material now comes from Washington and
Oregon, and is stored in 14 refrigerated semi-trailers at the
factory.
   Hale says the factory accepts written orders for the wreaths
from anywhere in the United States at the CAP office in Lancaster,
Ky., 40446.
   Christmas Ridge wreaths are sold primarily through direct-mail
promotions, which Hale says has yielded declining returns during
the past few years.
   He says the factory also makes wreaths for several mail order
catalogs and has started selling the products this year as part of
fund-raising projects for other non-profit groups.

   A twist on the traditional is suggested for holiday tree
decorations this year.
   ``Part of the fun in decorating for Christmas is doing the
unexpected,'' says Bette Rosenberg, home fashions director for
Spiegel, catalog merchandiser and marketer.
   ``For example, a twist on the most traditional Christmas
decoration of all, the tree,'' she says, ``will surely catch
everyone's eye.''
   Some ideas for decorating the tree:
   _ Dolls with checkerboard dresses, stuffed animals and miniature
wooden rocking chairs.
   _ Snowmen, gingerbread teddy bears and wood crayons.
   _ Birds-of-love ornaments and hand-painted angels.
   _ Clowns in black and gold lame costumes and twinkling glass
ornaments.
   _ White pine cones, sleighs and doves.
   _ Candles, baskets of flowers and carousel horses.
   _ Blue and gold ornaments and white candles.

   While thousands of Americans will sit
down to a feast of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and other
assorted fixings this year, the first Thanksgiving celebrated by
Pilgrims and Indians was a more modest affair.
   Venison and cod, lobster and sea bass, squash, beans and
artichokes probably comprised at least part of the historic
peace-feast between the Wampanoag Indians and the Pilgrim settlers
367 years ago.
   In the fall of 1621, the 52 men, women and children who survived
the first year in the New World after leaving England on the
Mayflower decided to hold a celebratory feast. Fifty others died of
frostbite, pneumonia and starvation. Just four adult housewives
survived the first winter.
   ``Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on
fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice together
after we had gathered the fruit of our labors,'' Edwin Winslow, a
Pilgrim, wrote in a first-hand report of the feast.
   The three-day secular celebration was held sometime between
Sept. 21 and Nov. 9, according to historians at Plimoth Plantation,
a Pilgrim village re-creation in Plymouth.
   Two primary references from the first Thanksgiving remain,
including a diary kept by Gov. William Bradford. They show that the
feast included cod, sea bass, wildfowl such as geese, ducks and
swans, wild turkeys, corn meal and five deer brought by the
Indians, about 90 of whom attended.
   The turkeys, though, were dry and stringy, and the meat was
probably boiled. Some of the vegetables were eaten raw but most
were boiled. Cranberries, plentiful in New England, also were
served.
   Beer was the liquid of choice, even for children, since the
water was considered unreliable. Among the desserts served were
pudding and ashcakes, cornmeal cakes baked in ashes.
   There was no cider, because apple and other fruit trees would
take years to bear fruit after planting. No potatoes, no corn on
the cob, no molasses, no coffee or tea either.
   The Pilgrims and Indians broke a variety of breads at
cloth-covered tables sitting on benches; some of the important men
had chairs. There were some knives and forks, but no spoons. Hands
were the utensils of choice.
   The feast was formalized under President George Washington, who
set aside Thursday, Nov. 26, 1790, as the first officials day of
Thanksgiving for ``the many signal favors of Almighty God.'' But it
wasn't until 1863 that Thanksgiving Day became an annual holiday,
decreed by President Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War.
   These days, the town of Plymouth stages events to commemorate
the first Thanksgiving, including a public dinner at Memorial Hall
that normally attracts about 2,000 people.
   Many of the town's attractions, including Cranberry World
Visitors Center, the Mayflower II replica and the 1627 Pilgrim
Village remain open on the holiday.

   It was in the year 165 B.C. that Judah Macabee and his followers
defeated three Syrian generals and recaptured and rededicated the
temple at Jerusalem.
   Jews around the world still celebrate the event, Hanukkah, an
eight-day holiday which this year begins the night of Dec. 3.
   Hanukkah, the festival of lights, is one of the few holidays
that unites Israeli Jews, divided at other times along religious
and secular lines.
   Secular Jews observe it as a celebration of the victory by the
small band of Jewish rebels over their mighty Syrian rulers as a
symbol for modern-day Zionism.
   
   Religious Jews emphasize an ancient miracle said to have
occurred at the temple after it was liberated, when an eternal
flame burned for eight days on oil that should have lasted one day.
   
   Whatever their level of observance, almost all Israeli Jews at
some time light the menorah, the holy lamp that recalls the story
of Judah and his followers.
   
   Jewish tradition holds that when the rebels were purifying the
temple of pagan rituals performed by the Syrians, they found enough
oil for only one day to relight an eternal flame. But miraculously,
the flame burned eight days until more oil arrived.
   While the traditional menorah is described in the Bible as
having seven candlesticks, a special candlelabrum with nine
candlesticks _ the hanykkiyah _is used only to celebrate Hanukkah.
   
   For the eight days of Hanukkah, Jews celebrate by lighting an
additional candle each night on the candlelabrum. A ninth candle in
the middle, known as the ``shamash'' or servant in Hebrew, is used
to light the other eight.
   In Israel, menorahs adorn public buildings and flicker in the
windows of homes. At Jerusalem's Western Wall, commonly known as
the Wailing Wall and the last remnant of the rebuilt temple
destroyed in 70 A.D., a large oil-burning lamp is lighted each
night by leading rabbis and biblical scholars.
   In the United States, Hanukkah is often marked by giving lavish
gifts. But Hanukkah presents are rarely exchanged in Israel.
Children receive small sums of money, known as Hanukkah ``gelt'' in
Yiddish, or the traditional four-sided spinning top called a
``dreidel.''
   Many believe that Hanukkah gift-giving became popular in the
United States because of the holiday's proximity to Christmas.

   Toys, toys, toys, toys, toys, toys.
   Toys to the left of us; toys to the right of us.
   Toys up this aisle and toys down that one.
   Baubles, trinkets, playthings, dolls, video games, board games,
card games, construction games.
   It's little wonder that Santa's beard is white.
   The nation's retailers are expected to provide some 150,000
items to choose from this holiday season, with more than 5,000 of
them new this year.
   Yet, caution seems to be the watchword for both customer and
retailer, says Douglas Thomson, president of the the Toy
Manufacturers of America, a trade association.
   ``Retailers are cautious, extremely slow in placing orders this
year,'' he says, ``and in the kinds of toys they order, too.
They're taking fewer chances. Customers are more conservative,
too.''
   Industry growth is seen as ``a little flat,'' as it was in 1986
and 1987, when sales were the same, $12.5 billion.
   Thomson sees this year as a continuation of the ``cooling off
and consolidation'' time, still ``quite good,'' but less successful
than the 1983-1985 period of exceptional business that he says was
caused by a sudden consumer interest in Cabbage Patch dolls, the
Trivial Pursuit board game and Transformer toys.
   He sees these trends in toys for this season:
   _ A continuing resurgence of popularity in video games,
especially among young boys. Led by Nintendo products, this area
has had the biggest effect in sales and will continue, he says.
   Last year's home video game sales were estimated at more than $1
billion.
   _ Board games will continue to be strong. Pictionary, from The
Games Gang, has been a sales leader, he says, with nearly 10
million copies sold since it was introduced.
   (The Games Gang now follows up with Balderdash, promoted as
``the hilarious bluffing game,'' based on definitions for zany, yet
real words. There's now a second edition of Pictionary and a junior
version.)
   _ ``Back to basics'' toys remain popular, like the ``good play
value'' of Fisher-Price product, make-believe-type toys and
``construction'' toys, from Duplo and Lego and Tyco as well as
Fisher-Price.
   On this theory that ``everything old is new again,'' Creative
Playthings is re-introducing some of its more popular outdoor
wooden playgrounds and accessories.
   ``All a child needs is one block of wood,'' says David Hessel,
executive vice president of Creative Playthings. ``Children will be
creative through their own imagination and that one block of wood
will become anything that the child dreams of.''

   When shopping for children this holiday season, avoid the fad
toys, suggests an association of early childhood professionals.
   Fad toys often bore children quickly, says Susan Bredekamp of
the National Association for the Education of Young Children
(NAEYC).
   ``There is a reason the same toys are played with generation
after generation _ wooden blocks, crayons, puzzles, trucks, dolls,
and so forth,'' she says. ``It's because they meet the need that
young children have always had and will always have.''
   She has some other ideas:
   _ Know the age of the child you're buying for, especially up to
age 3. ``When in doubt about what a child might like,'' she says,
``pick something he or she will grow into within six months.''
   _ Buy toys that involve the child, not that only entertain.
   _ Price has no bearing on the interest a child will have in a
toy. ``Many favorite activities of children involve inexpensive
articles _ packsts of colored construction paper, a box of chalk,
plastic stacking cups, harmonicas,'' she says.

   Some of the worst toys for children are the expensive gimmicky
spectator type, such as talking dolls and bears because they do
things as the child watches passively, according to Jack Lochhead
of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
   Such toys squelch the child's imagination and limit play,
explains Lochhead, director of the university's Center for
Cognitive Research Processes.
   The best toys, he says, are low cost, low tech toys that offer
imaginative play _ unpainted wooden blocks that help teach
geometric patterns and mathematical concepts and the educational
toys often found in schools.

   Parents who've finally gotten used to their kids firing light
guns at the television or being lost for hours in electronic
labyrinths may want to brace themselves for this year's Christmas
offerings from the video game makers.
   Among the gadgets being introduced this season are game sets
that can sub for home computers, game cartridges with memories that
rival business computers, and a rug that plays music when you dance
on it.
   The mainstays, however, are still the fantasies that let
youngsters believe they can out-shoot, out-fight, out-drive and
out-wit the bigger bad guys.
   Home video games were the hot seller among toys last Christmas,
with 1987 total sales reaching about $1.1 billion, says market
leader Nintendo of America. But this year, Nintendo and its
competitors say, total sales should more than double.
   Just a few years ago, video games were considered an outdated
fad. While consumers had paid $3 billion a year for games and game
cartridges in the early 1980s, industry experts say that by 1985,
sales had fallen to about $100 million, with manufacturers letting
$35 game cartridges go for $5 or less.
   That year, however, Nintendo, a subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Ltd.
of Japan, began test-marketing a new game system that had been a
runaway success with the Japanese. The Nintendo Entertainment
System, essentially a small computer, control panels, and game
cartridges containing computer chips, offered more intricate games
with higher-quality graphics and sound.
   Folks in this country liked it, too, and Nintendo, manufacturer
of such hit arcade games as Donkey Kong and Mario Bros., led a
comeback for the video-game market.
   This year, Nintendo and its two main rivals, Atari Corp. and
Tonka Products Co., forecast the total video game market at up to
$2.3 billion, with perhaps 8 million units being sold.
   Nintendo spokesman Robert Lindner says the Redmond, Wash.-based
company and its licensees anticipate garnering $1.7 billion of the
total. Lindner said Nintendo estimates its current market share at
77.4 percent, with Atari at 13.3 percent and Tonka's Sega at 4.1
percent.
   He gets an argument from Michael Katz, president of Atari's
entertainment electronics division in Sunnyvale, Calif. Katz pegs
his company's dollar share of the market at 20 percent.
   Another objection comes from Patty Lewis, vice president of
marketing and product development for Sega in Minnetonka, Minn.,
who says Sega expects about a 13 percent share.
   Whatever those numbers might be, here are some that might be of
more interest to shoppers: Expect to pay anywhere from $50 to $150
for a game set, and from $15 to over $50 for a game cartridge,
depending on features and complexity.
   Most of Nintendo's games run about $35. The top-selling game has
been ``The Legend of Zelda,'' a fantasy adventure. However, Lindner
says it's about to be overtaken by ``Super Mario Bros. II,'' the
latest adventures of Mario and his brother, Luigi, who made their
arcade reputation by battling Bowsers and Mushroom People.
   ``Mike Tyson's Punch-Out,'' a boxing game plugged by the
heavyweight champ, and two racing games, ``R.C. Pro-Am'' and
``Excitebike,'' also are doing well, Lindner says.
   Atari, which started this whole business back in the 1970s, when
founder Nolan Bushnell cooked up a game called ``Pong,'' this year
is offering three different systems, starting with the 2600, which
retails at about $50.
   The 2600 was the machine that led the first video game boom,
from 1976-1983. Katz says it now sells for about $50, a third of
what it was a decade ago, while game cartridges are all under $15.
   Hundreds of games are available, but among the top sellers are
such old favorites as ``Pole Position,'' a race-car game, and
arcade standards ``Centipede'' and ``Ms. Pac Man.''
   At the mid-price level, around $80, is Atari's 7800 system,
which can run more complicated games, along with those made for the
2600. Game cartridges go for $20 and under, with the best seller
being ``One-on-One Basketball,'' promoted by Larry Bird and Julius
``Dr. J'' Erving.
   Atari's top-of-the-line is the XE, ``an ultimate game system but
also a beginning computer,'' says Katz. With 64 kilobytes of
memory, a keyboard, a joystick and light gun, the system can play
games similar to those offered for home computer, and even act as a
word processor. ``Hardball,'' a baseball game, is among the top
sellers, as is ``Fight Night,'' a boxing game.
   Sega offers a basic system for $79 that includes the game
machine, two controllers and a built-in game, says Ms. Lewis.
Adding a light gun and another game brings the price to $99, while
the deluxe set, with 3-D glasses, brings it to $149.
   Sega is introducing 12 new games, including ``Monopoly,''
``Shinobi,'' a karate game, ``Thunderblade,'' a helicopter attack
game, and ``Double Dragon,'' a version of an arcade game in which a
couple of guys rescue a girl.
   At the top of its list, however, is ``Phantasy Star,'' a
role-playing adventure designed to compete with ``Legend of Zelda.''
   The games range from about $25 to $45, except for ``Phantasy
Star,'' which sells for over $50.

   In the coming weeks, as stores and shopping
malls fill with people buying Christmas gifts, it might look like
any other holiday season.
   But the bustle will mask the fact that cautious consumer
spending has forced retailers to take a subdued approach to this
Christmas and their prospects for meaningful sales growth in the
foreseeable future.
   Nonetheless, stores are expected to have a profitable season.
   ``Last year, I played Ebenezer Scrooge,'' said Robert Buchanan,
an analyst with the investment firm A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St.
Louis. ``This year I'm a little more upbeat _ especially with
respect to earnings _ because of the constructive steps the
retailers have taken in recognition of slower sales.''
   Said Michael Wellman, vice president for marketing at K mart
Corp., ``Christmas is going to be very competitive, but no reason
to be gnashing one's teeth over the consumer who doesn't seem to
have much enthusiasm.''
   Estimates of sales growth this season range from 4 percent to 6
percent over Christmas 1987 levels, or about the pace of inflation
so far this year. That's what economist David Wyss calls ``a
mediocre Christmas, not a terrible one.''
   ``People are a little bit nervous about the economy,'' said
Wyss, of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.-based economic
forecasting service.
   ``It's been a year since the (stock market) crash, but I don't
think the crash has entirely left their minds,'' he said.
   Higher interest rates, relatively weak growth in income and a
low savings rate are also contributing to consumers' uneasiness,
Wyss said.
   Christmas is make-it-or-break it time for retailers because they
earn as much of 60 percent of their annual profits during the
fourth quarter. But even if this season proves to be unexciting,
there is little fear that earnings will suffer.
   ``Retailers are generally lean on their inventories heading into
Christmas,'' said Buchanan. Less merchandise on hand means less
merchandise to be marked down at the end of the season.

   Forty years ago, when the late songwriter Johnny Marks penned
his first draft of ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' he was
unhappy with it _ so unhappy he thought it was the worst song he
ever wrote.
   In fact, Marks' dissatisfaction was such that he put the song
aside and didn't get back to it until the following year.
   But in 1949, while humming the melody during a walk near his
home in New York's Greenwich Village, the composer hit upon a
solution:
   Instead of having the notes in the unsatisfactory opening bars
dropping down the scale, he reversed the progression and had them
go up.
   Asked how long it took to complete the new version, Marks
replied:
   ``It took me only two weeks, but 20 years of songwriting to
learn what to throw away.''
   Since then, ``Rudolph'' has been a spectacular success.
   According to one record industry source, it has been translated
into nearly every language and sold approximately 150 million
records, more than 8 million copies of sheet music and 25 million
copies of 200 arrangements for orchestras, bands and choral groups.
   Gene Autry first recorded it and gave the first live performance
of the song at a rodeo at New York's Madison Square Garden,
changing the finale of his show from ``Ghost Riders in the Sky'' to
``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.''
   Marks, who died in 1985, often was called ``Mr. Christmas of the
music world.'' Among his other holiday compositions were ``I Heard
the Bells on Christmas Day,'' ``Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree''
and ``A Holly Jolly Christmas.''
   Perhaps the most memorable of Christmas songs, however, is
``White Christmas.''
   Sung by Bing Crosby in the 1942 movie, ``Holiday Inn,'' it
became Irving Berlin's greatest hit and resulted in the 1954 movie
``White Christmas,'' starring Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney
and Vera-Ellen.
   Written during World War II, Berlin has said ``it was nostalgic
for a lot of boys who weren't home for Christmas.'' It's been a lot
more than that, perhaps the second most popular Christmas song
ever, to ``Silent Night.''
   In 1973, the International Society of Santa Claus gave its first
award to Marks, for ``Rudolph,'' and Berlin, for ``White
Christmas,'' in recognition of their contribution to the spirit of
Christmas.
   Runners-up were Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol'' and
Clement Moore's ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas.''
   Another Christmas song, ``Silver Bells,'' was written by Jay
Evans and Ray Livingston for Christmas sequences of a Bob Hope film
comedy, ``The Lemon Drop Kid'' (1951). It became the biggest seller
for the song-writing team.
   One of the many joys of the 1944 movie, ``Meet Me in St.
Louis,'' was Judy Garland's singing ``Have Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas'' by Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin.

   The film world has long been fascinated with
the yuletide season.
   Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' the time-worn tale of
Scrooge and Tiny Tim, may well be the most recurrent of the
Christmas movies. It appeared in several versions during the silent
era, then MGM made a 1938 ``A Christmas Carol'' with Reginald Owen
as Scrooge. In 1951, the English did their own version with
Alistair Sims as the legendary penny-pincher (the British had done
an undistinguished ``Scrooge'' in 1935).
   Albert Finney was unrecognizable in the title role of the 1970
``Scrooge,'' and a recent version starring George C. Scott has
become a television perennial. A couple of years ago, the Walt
Disney company enlisted all of its cartoon stars for a featurette
``Mickey's Christmas Carol.''
   The song ``White Christmas,'' sung by Bing Crosby in the 1942
film, ``Holiday Inn,'' became Irving Berlin's greatest hit and
resulted in the 1954 movie, ``White Christmas.''
   Frank Capra's unabashed sentiment often resulted in Christmas
scenes, notably in ``Meet John Doe'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
The latter shows up regularly on holiday television.
   Oddly, most films with ``Christmas'' in the title have fared
poorly at the box office.
   ``The Christmas Tree,'' starring William Holden and Virna Lisi,
was a 1969 bomb.
   In 1944, Universal cast its biggest star, Deanna Durbin, in a
grim melodrama with Gene Kelly, ``Christmas Holiday.'' Audiences
voted overwhelmingly for Deanna to return to musicals.
   Other misfires: ``Christmas Eve,'' three wayward sons (George
Raft, Randolph Scott, George Brent) return to their mother (Ann
Harding) for the holiday (1944); ``Christmas in July,'' a tame
satire of the advertising industry by Preston Sturges (1940);
``Christmas in July,'' a soap opera with Barbara Stanwyck and
Dennis Morgan (1945).
   Disney had little luck with ``One Magic Christmas,'' a
Capra-esque fantasy starring Mary Steenburgen and Harry Dean
Stanton.
   The producers of ``Superman'' thought they would have another
box-office bonanza with a big-budget ``Santa Claus: The Movie,''
starring David Huddleston in the title role and Dudley Moore as
chief elf. They thought wrong. The film was the turkey of 1985.
   The most successful film about Christmas has been George
Seaton's ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' starring Edmund Gwenn as a
department store Santa Claus who claims to be the real thing. The
film, which also starred Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and a young
Natalie Wood, has become a television perennial and has now been
colorized _ much to the distress of purists.
   Some other films featuring Christmas: ``The Holly and the Ivy''
(1952), ``The Inn of the Sixth Happiness'' (1958), ``The Bells of
St. Mary's'' (1945), ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' (1941), ``Young
at Heart'' (1954), ``The Apartment'' (1960), ``The Glenn Miller
Story'' (1954), Not to mention ``Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians'' (1980).

   That winter wish list for well-stocked wallets,
the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog, this year reflects that not
everything is better in pairs, providing a lift for Yuletide
spirits with a ``his-or-hers'' hot-air balloon.
   But for conspicuous holiday consumers, the company that
introduced his-and-hers camels, dirigibles and spangled cats is not
saying that togetherness is out of vogue with the affluent.
   Featured in the catalog is the Neiman Marcus Cloudhopper, a
30-foot-tall hot-air balloon that fits into an automobile trunk and
onto the back of its rider.
   ``We only have one balloon, the Cloudhopper,'' says company
spokeswoman Pat Zajac. ``Only one can ride in it. Of course, if 20
people want one, that's no problem. We are prepared to provide as
many Cloudhoppers as the world wants.''
   Constructed by Per Lindstrand of Thunder and Colt Balloons,
England, the ``fantasy of free-flight'' sells for a mere $18,000.
   ``We always look for things that are unexpected, unusual,'' says
Ms. Zajac, ``and this is the world's first backpack balloon.
   ``It's the most compact balloon ever offered to the public,''
she says. ``It's a backpack balloon that fits in the trunk of a car
as a whole unit.''
   Not all the catalog gifts are for loners. But like an upscale
``Easy Rider,'' a customer can take to the road riding a limited
edition Harley-Davidson Heritage Softail motorcycle with customized
seat and sporting a matching helmet and his-or-hers black leather
jacket with silver studs.
   ``Malcolm Forbes would love it,'' says Ms. Zajac, referring to
the publishing magnate who owns a collection of motorcycles. ``You
are seeing more CEOs and business people out on the road with their
motorcycles.
   ``Liz Taylor loves the color purple. Malcolm has supplied her
with her own violet motorcycle.''
   The wanderlust may strike Christmas shoppers in a more
down-to-earth way.
   For $25,000, you can take a 10-day bicycle tour of Italy's
Tuscany Region on custom Cinelli touring bikes, which may be
personalized with your monogram or family crest.
   The romantic tour for two, ``the Tuscany Gran Turismo,'' comes
with a deluxe motor coach and a driver-guide to accompany the
riders, who can room at luxurious country inns and villas through
the trip.
   This year, the gift selection contains a touch of humor. There's
a silver-plated baby bottle for a budding corporate chief executive
officer at $25.
   ``We have taken the baby from silver spoon in mouth to bottle,''
says Ms. Zajac.
   Other novelties include an edible chocolate chess set, giant
milk- and white-chocolate postage stamp replicas, brooches of metal
and precious stones depicting official birds of the 50 states and a
set of howling coyote salt and pepper shakers, handmade in
Albuquerque by a native artist.
   Ms. Zajac says 3.2 million Neiman Marcus catalogs were mailed to
shoppers worldwide.
   ``Through the years, we have tried to appeal to the humor and
the child in all of us,'' she says. ``We try to approach the
merchandising of the Christmas book with humor and whimsy. If
nothing else, it is a wish book for those who read it.''

   With jingle bells and church bells, sleigh bells and ornamental
bells, the image is festive and holiday-happy.
   The seasonal association with bells goes back centuries, when
churches used bells to call the people to prayer. Essayist Charles
Lamb was later to call bells ``the music bordering nearest heaven.''
   The Riverside Church in New York City has 74 bells, weighing
40,800 pounds, and is believed to be the largest carillon in North
America by total weight. The carillon at the Kirk-in-the-Hills near
Detroit has 77 bells, according to Terry Mayer, president of the
Metropolitan New York chapter of the American Bell Association
International and a designer of bell jewelry.

   What are American shoppers looking for this holiday season?
   ``Decision-making will be based on a new set of criteria
emphasizing old-fashioned quality and contemporary convenience,''
says Robert L. Cohen, vice president of Yankelovich Clancy Shulman,

   ``Familiarity and reliability plus value-added extras such as
guarantees are at the top of the list, especially at Christmas,''
he says.

   The holiday season can bring out the worst
in Christmas shoppers when it comes to irrational buying, according
to a Miami University marketing expert.
   ``When we feel depressed by the season, it's not uncommon for us
to go out and buy items we don't want or need, just to pick up our
spirits,'' says Jack Gifford, chairman of the university's
marketing department.
   Another holiday buying trend, he says, indicates shoppers also
find it much easier to spend lots of money on several smaller items
and avoid the one major ticket item.
   For many busy families, according to another Miami University
professor, stress is intensified during the yuletide season.
   ``Christmas is particularly stressful for two-income families
attempting to balance the demands of jobs with personal
expectations of family togetherness and holiday activities,'' says
Timothy Brubaker, director of the university's Family and Child
Studies Center.
   ``Addressing Christmas cards can be a major chore, much less
baking and decorating cookies or entertaining, and the interruption
in routines caused by school holidays adds to the tension,'' he
says.
   Brubaker, who edits ``Family Relations,'' a journal of applied
family and child studies published by the National Council on
Family Relations, also believes holiday media images don't help
with their portrayal of ``traditional'' families and career couples
who are always at home.
   Reality is much different, he says, noting that according to the
1987 census both mothers and fathers are employed in 57 percent of
two-parent families with children 6 or under.
   And then there is the matter of New Year's resolutions.
   Many people find their will power to follow through on the
resolutions begins to falter by early February because of a complex
mind game called ``self-handicapping,'' says Richard Sherman,
professor of social psychology at the university.
   ``Self-handicapping gives people an excuse so that if a
situation fails, it's not their fault,'' Sherman explains.
   ``For example, Debbie could get a date if she lost weight.
However, if she loses the weight and still can't get a date, she no
longer has a ready reason. Having an excuse for failure is much
less threatening than thinking we are not capable of succeeding.''

   The Holidays are here, the Holidays are there,
the Holidays are, in fact, nearly everywhere.
   America must love its holidays, at least judging by the files of
the federal government, since the nation has no fewer than 110
places called Holiday.
   From Holiday Hills, Ark., to Holiday Acres, Del., and from
Holiday Shores, Mo., to Holiday Resort, Tenn., these festive
appellations sprinkle the land.
   And that's not all. A look at the U.S. Geological Survey's
Geographic Names Information System shows 89 Christmases across the
country, along with seven places called Santa Claus, three Yules
(all in Colorado) and even one poinsettia _ Poinsettia Park in Polk
County, Fla.
   The U.S.G.S. names information system, which has collected more
than 2 million names of places and geographic features for use in
federal mapping and data programs, shows Texas is tops in Christmas
country with 10 places using that name, while there are three
Christmases in Florida and seven each in Arizona and California.
   There's Christmas Knob in Oneida County, N.Y., and Christmas
Cove in Maine; Christmas Camp Lake in Louisiana and Christmas
Landing in Alabama.
   Presiding over Christmas are the seven Santa Clauses, including
the community of Santa Claus in Toombs County, Ga.
   Others include Santa Claus churches in Alaska and Indiana;
locations called Santa Claus in Arizona, Indiana and Minnesota;
Santa Claus Spring in Nevada and Santa Claus Rock in Utah.
   For the decorative, there are 542 spots nationwide called holly,
more than enough to decorate the lone wreath: Wreath Hill in
Campbell County, Wyo.
   Folks more inclined to snuggle up and kiss on the holidays can
find ample comfort in a dozen Mistletoes.
   Mistletoe Mine in Nevada might be a good spot, since it's no
longer active; or perhaps Mistletoe State Park in Columbia County,
Ga.
   They could walk Mistletoe Trail in Maryland, study their skills
at Mistletoe School in Shasta County, Calif., drift across
Mistletoe Lake, Minn., and perhaps even end their days at Mistletoe
Cemetery in Goliad County, Texas.
   If festive song is desired, some 30 Noels mark this land from
Noel Bay, S.C., to Noel Creek, Mont.; Noel, Colo., and even Noel
Ditch in Seneca County, Ohio.
   Looking for a white Christmas? Perhaps it can be found at the
nation's 563 ``snow'' place names.
   There's Snow Hill, Conn., where a white Christmas is likely, and
Snow Brake in Tallahatchie County, Miss., where the chance is
smaller. Others include Snow Lake, Neb., Snow Pond, N.H.; Snow
School in North Dakota and Snow Cemetery in Windham County, Vt.
   And just to round up the seasonal decorations with a traditional
Christmas Tree, the nation's place names include 5,073 spots with
``pine'' in their names, as well as 98 ``spruces,'' 735 ``balsams''
and 130 places named ``fir.''
   ``Tinsel'' appears only twice _ for lakes in Michigan and
Wisconsin _ but for other decorations there are 129 ``garland''
locations as well as 358 ``bells,'' 138 ``angels'' and 434 places
in the United States with ``light'' in their names.

   The American Automobile Association estimates that 25 million
Americans will hit the road during this Christmas holiday.
   For those who plan such a trip, there is now a second edition of
Patricia Carpenter's ``Away for the Holiday,'' a soft-cover

   Is firing people during the holidays cruel or kind, and could
this actually be an opportune time to be out of work?
   According to Stephen Strasser, associate professor of management
and human resources at Ohio State University, there is no good time
to get laid off from work.
   But a holiday firing can present natural opportunities to
network, says Strasser, author of ``Working It Out: Sanity and
Success in the Workplace.''
   ``People are usually very supportive and sympathetic,'' he says,
``because we all easily identify with the individual who has been
fired.''
   Strasser adds that holidays can be a good time for job hunting
because ``many companies review their budgets and staff changes
often are made at the first of the year.''

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today
despite intervention by the Bank of Japan, while share prices rose
slightly on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 125.00 yen, down 1.08 yen from Friday's
finish at 126.08 yen. Opening at 125.72 yen, the currency fell and
ranged from 124.98-125.85 yen.
   ``The central bank intervened a few times, but it didn't work,''
said Michiko Kawai, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   A Bank of Japan official refused to say if it had intervened to
try to keep the dollar from falling.
   ``We know nothing about it. We don't give out any information
about our activities,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar opened low mainly due to a
decline in the currency on overseas markets. They said investors'
generally felt the U.S. economy was slowing down and that was
driving the dollar down.
   Kawai said the dollar-selling mood was still strong in the
market.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 219.67-point winner
Saturday, gained 21.53 more points, or 0.08 percent, to end at
27,982.54. The market has risen six straight days starting last
Tuesday.
   The Nikkei topped the 28,000 level at mid-morning today for the
first time since Sept. 19, when Emperor Hirohito fell seriously ill.
   But profit-taking and fears about the continued rise in share
prices over the last five trading days gradually pressed the Nikkei
back below the 28,000-point level toward the end of the trading,
dealers said.
   In a moderate trading with volume on the first section estimated
at $1.1 billion, food, drugs and paper issues attracted investors.

decision on the project sometime around next April or May, based on
the results of an ongoing feasibility study.''
   A 4-megabit DRAM, said to be the next-generation computer memory
chip, has four times the memory capacity of a 1-megabit DRAM, the
most advanced computer chip currently being mass-produced.
   Saito said his company plans to send commercial samples of the
4-megabit DRAMs to the United States next month, even though the
chips are not yet available on the Japanese market.
   No other Japanese makers have yet launched the production of
4-megabit DRAMs commercially.
   Presently, 1-megabit DRAMs are used in mainframe computers,
high-performance work stations and other electronics equipment.

<HEAD>Chinese Say Austerity Drive Won't Hurt Foreign Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-China On Hold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>

   Chinese officials are taking pains to assure
foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite
plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic
companies.
   China's handling of its latest austerity drive, the third since
it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978, shows a new
awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and
avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to
development.
   Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, Trade Minister Zheng
Tuobin and the Bank of China all have promised in recent weeks that
China's 9,700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity
measures intended to stem a 20-percent inflation.
   ``All signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures
will be implemented,'' Li told about 200 visiting chief executive
officers of American companies on Oct. 17. He repeated the same
message later in the week to a Japanese banking delegation.
   The Bank of China, the chief Chinese lender to joint ventures,
said it will continue doing so.
   One of China's leading investment and trade companies, the Kang
Hua Development Corp., which has been stripped of trade rights and
ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal
operations, promised it will carry out all contracts already signed
with foreign companies.
   Kang Hua has signed about 4,000 import and export contracts
worth a total of $670 million since being founded 17 months ago.
   The assurances seem to be having their desired effect. Foreign
businessmen and diplomats in Beijing said they expect a drop in
Chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint
venture activity. Most seemed confident the impact would be minimal.
   One predicted delays in signing new contracts, however, as the
central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed
out any not deemed essential.
   Chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be
slowed and Beijing must reassert central control over the economy
to restore order to a market in which excessive demand has
generated inflation, hoarding and black marketeering.
   Foreign companies that sell factory equipment, raw materials and
luxuries to China, from cars to air conditioners, can expect a drop
in orders. Import taxes on a wide range of goods have been
increased and calls have been issued for import substitution where
possible.
   However, Premier Li told the chief executive officers that China
remains interested in joint projects in energy, transportation,
communications, raw material production and high-technology.
   Foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances
in China, such as televisions and refrigerators, are welcome only
if their products are for export, Li said.
   The government also has said the construction of hotels,
auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed.
Companies found guilty of illegal transactions, such as buying and
selling scarce goods on the black market, will be closed and
companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun
off.
   Specifics, such as which projects will be halted and which
Chinese companies reorganized or closed, have been slow to emerge,
and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the
eventual impact. There have been no reports of casualties in the
form of canceled contract talks.
   The government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980
and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for
imports. Some joint ventures were halted in midstream or canceled,
as were many import orders.
   ``At that time (the Chinese) had no cash,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``Now it's different, they have the cash. They're trying
to pause and think.''

<TEXT>
   Budget Rent A Car Corp. will be acquired for $333
million by an investment group led by Gibbons, Green van Amerongen
Ltd. and Budget's management in a deal financed primarily by the
Ford Motor Co., officials said today.
   Budget, the nation's third-largest rental car company and the
only one still publicly held, said Beech Holdings Corp. would pay
$30 a share for the Chicago-based company's 11.1 million
outstanding shares.
   Budget closed Friday at $17.12{ in over-the-counter trading.
   The deal was struck Sunday in New York, said Budget spokeswoman
Jody Wilson.
   This will be the second time in two years that Budget has been
taken private by Gibbons, Green and Budget's management.
   Gibbons Green, an investment banking firm, is the general
partner of the investment company that owns Beech Holdings. The
agreement calls for Budget's management to purchase voting shares
of Beech Holdings and continue to operate Budget.
   Ford's financing will be through a purchase of non-voting shares
of Beech Holdings, Budget said in a statement. Budget did not
reveal the amount of Ford's investment.
   As part of the deal, Budget and Ford signed a long-term
agreement to maintain their existing supply relationship, Budget
said.
   Budget is the nation's third-largest car-rental agency, behind
No. 1 Hertz and second-ranked Avis. Ford already has a stake in
Hertz.
   Budget went public in May 1987 at $14 a share. It was previously
held by Transamerica Corp., which sold Budget in 1986 in a
leveraged buyout to Gibbons, Green and Budget's senior management.
   Budget reported its third-quarter earnings rose 57 percent to a
$8.8 million, compared with $5.6 million in the third quarter of
1987.
   Its third-quarter revenue was $152.1 million, 32 percent higher
than the $115.6 million recorded for the same period of 1987, Ms.
Wilson said.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade with the soybean market
leading the way on a combination of technical buy signals and
indications of stronger export demand.
   Analysts said professionals who watch trends on price charts had
turned bullish on the soybean market following Friday's late rally,
which appeared to mark a turnaround in the market's direction.
   Most of the news last week was bearish for beans and ``when a
market stops going down on negative news, it's always a sign to
technicians that we've just about sold off enough, at least for the
near term,'' said Richard Feltes, director of commodities research
with Refco Inc., a Chicago-based commodities brokerage.
   Feltes also said a large foreign grain company was positioned to
take delivery of a large amount of soybeans, which the market saw
as a positive sign on the export sales front.
   In early trading, wheat was 2} cents to 4{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.14 a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $2.80} a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.36 a bushel;
and soybeans were 4 cents lower to 7 cents higher with November at
$7.75 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were most lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .22 cent lower with December at
73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with November at 81.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .25
cent lower to .08 cent higher with December at 40.95 cents a pound;
and frozen pork bellies were .65 cent lower to .03 cent higher with
February at 46.25 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on Friday while pork futures

<HEAD>Ward's: Chrysler to End LeBaron Production in March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will end production of its
Chrysler LeBaron GTS and Dodge Lancer automobiles in March because
of slumping sales, an automotive newsletter said Monday.
   Ward's Automotive Reports said halting production of the models,
called H-cars by Chrysler, will result in a few layoffs at the
company's Sterling Heights, Mich. plant.
   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said Monday he had no comment on
future production or product plans.
   The Sterling Heights factory also makes the Dodge Shadow and the
Plymouth Sundance, which require less labor time to assemble than
the Lancer-LeBaron GTS models. The Sterling Heights plant will
shift to making just the Shadow and Sundance models, Ward's said,
quoting plant sources.
   Nicoll said the Shadow-Sundance cars account for 92 percent of
the cars coming off the assembly line at the Sterling Heights
plant, the rest being LeBaron GTS and Lancer models.
   Through September of this year, Ward's said, LeBaron GTS sales
have slipped to 13,000 from 25,000 a year ago, a 48 percent
decline. Lancer sales have dropped to 9,000 in the
January-September period this year from 19,000 during the same time
last year, a 52.6 percent decline.
   The newsletter also said that the LeBaron and Lancer may be
reintroduced in the 1993 model year on the ``LH'' platform and be
assembled at the company's expanded Jefferson Avenue plant in
Detroit.

   The unprecedented, mid-October frenzy of buyout
bids that hit Wall Street has spawned its biggest deal yet, a $13.1
billion mega-buyout of Kraft Inc. by Philip Morris Cos. Inc. that
would create the world's biggest consumer products company.
   The proposed combination announced Sunday _ if successful, the
biggest ever between two non-oil U.S. companies _ would end a short
but intense takeover battle between the two giant food and consumer
goods companies.
   It also would create a $40 billion-a-year company armed with
some of the nation's best-known consumer products, including Philip
Morris' Miller beer, Marlboro cigarettes, Jell-O and Maxwell House
coffee, and Kraft's Velveeta processed cheese, Parkay margarine,
Philadelphia cream cheese, Miracle Whip salad dressing and Sealtest
ice cream.
   That would fulfill Philip Morris' goal of reducing its
dependence on revenue from its slowing cigarette business, while
making it a tougher worldwide competitor against other giant
multinationals.
   ``As we have stated from the outset, we believe the combination
of Philip Morris and Kraft will create a U.S.-based food company
that will compete more effectively in world food markets,'' stated
Hamish Maxwell, chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris.
   ``Kraft's products provide an excellent complement to our
existing product lines and position us to capitalize on marketing
opportunities worldwide,'' Maxwell said.
   In a joint announcement, the companies said they had a
definitive agreement for Philip Morris to boost its outstanding
tender offer for all of Kraft's outstanding stock to $106 a share
from $90.
   Kraft shares closed at $96.50, up $2 a share, Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange. Philip Morris closed down 25 cents at $94.75 a
share.
   In midday trading today, Philip Morris was up $1.75 a share at
$96.50, while Kraft rose $7 a share to $103.50.
   Kraft had rejected as inadequate the $90 a share offer made on
Oct. 17, and unveiled a defensive restructuring it said would pay
its stockholders $110 a share in cash and securities.
   The restructuring _ thought by many analysts to be mainly a
bargaining ploy _ also would have boosted the company's debt load
by about $12.4 billion, likely forcing Kraft to sell some of its
businesses in order to raise cash for making debt payments.
   Last Tuesday, Kraft said it would negotiate only if Philip
Morris sweetened its offer to $110 a share or more, and sharply
stated it would not be pressured into a buyout.
   After negotiations last Friday in Chicago, company officials
hammered out a preliminary agreement that the Kraft board of
directors approved at a Sunday meeting in New York, Maxwell said in
a telephone interview.
   ``Our shareholders are receiving full value, and this merger is
the best possible outcome for our employees, customers and the
communities in which we operate,'' John M. Richman, Kraft chairman
and chief executive, stated Sunday.
   If completed, the merger would rank in size behind only the
$13.4 billion acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. by what is now Chevron
Corp. in 1984.
   With combined revenue of about $39.5 billion in the year ended
June 30, the company would rank as the world's biggest consumer
products maker, outpacing the $30 billion-a-year British-Dutch
company Unilever NV, according to industry estimates.
   The combination of Kraft and General Foods Corp., which Philip
Morris acquired for $5.6 billion in 1985, would produce about $20
billion in annual revenue, making Philip Morris the world's
second-biggest food company after Switzerland's $28 billion Nestle
SA.
   The proposed buyout comes on the heels of a stunning mid-October
wave of multibillion-dollar takeover bids focusing on food
companies, which heightened the importance of being able to compete
with the international behemoths.
   Still pending is a $20.3 billion buyout proposal by the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. for food and tobacco
giant RJR Nabisco Inc. Also pending are a $5.23 billion hostile bid
for Pillsbury Co. by Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC, a $1.4
billion bid for West Point-Pepperell Inc. by rival textile maker
Farley Inc and a $941.2 million bid for Holly Farms Corp. by Tyson
Foods Inc., two of the nation's biggest poultry processors.
   Maxwell said his company had no plans to sell any major Kraft
assets and believed the cash flow of the combined companies should
be sufficient for paying off the massive debt.
   He said Philip Morris already had $12 billion in bank financing
in place, which combined with cash on hand was enough to complete
the buyout.
   Maxwell said that despite the enormous costs of paying off the
huge debt, Philip Morris was expecting ``good improvement over this
year'' in its earnings for 1989 and 1990.
   Maxwell also echoed the observations of industry analysts who
have said a combination of the companies would mean greater
efficiency in areas such as advertising and food distribution,
while Kraft's international presence could help overseas marketing
of General Foods products.
   Kraft has been restructuring for several years in an effort to
shed its non-food operations.
   In 1986, the company formed Premark International Inc. to spin
off its consumer products operations. With the $1.8 billion sale of
its Duracell batteries unit this summer to a management group led
by Kohlberg Kravis, Kraft returned to its roots as a food and food
services concern.
   Philip Morris, for its part, has been attempting to reduce its
earnings dependence on the profitable but undependable tobacco
business, which accounts for about 78 percent of its earnings,
according to analysts. As part of that strategy, it acquired
General Foods.
   The tender offer expires at midnight Nov. 15 unless extended.
The deal is subject to a majority of Kraft shares being tendered
and federal antitrust clearance being given.
   Maxwell has indicated he did not anticipate any antitrust
problems because the companies' products compete in different
market segments.
   Richman and up to two other present members of the Kraft board
of directors were expected to join the Philip Morris board of
directors. Richman also was to be nominated as a vice chairman,
responsible for plans and programs aimed at maximizing benefits
from the joining of Kraft and General Foods.
   Kraft last year posted a profit of $489 million, or $3.60 a
share, on revenue of $9.9 billion.
   Philip Morris had an overall profit of $1.84 billion, or $7.75
per share, on revenue of $27.7 billion.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs declined
by 10 this week to total 923, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc.
said Monday.
   The decline follows an increase of eight the previous week and a
rise of 11 two weeks ago. A year ago, the count was 1,131, Baker
Hughes said.
   The count is the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, California had the sharpest
drop with seven fewer rigs, with Wyoming slipping by five; Kansas
three; and Louisiana and Oklahoma with one each.
   Pennsylvania posted the largest gain with five additional rigs,
with Texas and New Mexico adding three apiece; North Dakota and
Ohio, two each; and Michigan and Colorado, one each.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Monday it
will join with Multiflow Computer Inc. to market computer programs
for engineers.
   The engineering service bureau of Westinghouse will provide
programs and computer systems for analyzing electricity, magnetism,
heat and other areas in the realm called finite element analysis.
   Multiflow, based in Branford, Conn., is a leader in its field of
computer technology and is a leader in high performance computers
for science, engineering and general applications.
   ``At one time, a multi-million dollar supercomputer was the only
practical machine for solving a large class of sophisticated finite
element analysis problems,'' said Joe Santoro, a manager in
Westinghouse's nuclear and advanced technology division.
   ``Today, high-performance machines ... are bringing this
computing power within the reach of hundreds of engineering
organizations. Our approach with Multiflow is to provide an
economical hardware and software package for those organizations
that require near-supercomputer performance at a fraction of the
cost,'' he said.

   If nothing else, it's a lesson in
Economics 101: University of Texas junior Chuck Falgout invested
$21 in lecture notes and turned a possible F into a B in biology.
   A ``subscription'' of 48 issues from a note-taking service
helped the enterprising Falgout flesh out his understanding of a
difficult subject. And with the help of the store-bought notes, he
could even afford to miss a lecture or two.
   In an age when it seems everything can be had for a price,
lecture note sales are booming in college towns around the country,
fueled by rising demand from underachievers and overachievers alike.
   ``We like to consider it a supplement to your own notes, but
there are a lot of students who skip class,'' said Criss Dolan,
manager of Paradigm Notes in Austin, Texas, which sells the written
word on everything from anthropology to economics.
   Paradigm enjoyed so much success in its 14 years that it opened
stores in Arizona and Illinois and inspired a former customer to
open a shop in Columbus.
   The companies pay graduate students and college seniors with
good grades to attend classes and take notes for the publications.
   ``There are some professors who say, `Paradigm notetakers, don't
put this in your notes,' and we honor that,'' said Dolan.
   That allows a professor to slip in a key point or reveal a test
question to students who do attend class without actually punishing
those who skip, she said.
   Kathy Gatton, 26, said Paradigm helped her get through school
and four years later, she opened Grade A Notes across from Ohio
State University, home to 60,000 students.
   ``It's one of the largest universities and it didn't already
have a note-taking service,'' said Ms. Gatton, who expects to
triple her business and earn her first profit this university
quarter.
   Grade A opened in September of 1987 and earned modest revenues
of $60,000 in its first school year. This month, the company
expanded its note offerings and nearly doubled the size of its
office.
   ``Business has been great ... (but) we still get students who
come in and say `Gosh, I didn't know you were here. This is
great,''' said Ms. Gatton, who plans to franchise in 10 more big
campus towns in the next five years.
   Most of these services sell notes by the class for about $2 or
by subscription, for $18-$24 per quarter or semester. The note
takers have 24-48 hours to turn in their type-written notes. Most
are paid $10 to cover a 50-minute class session.
   ``It's great money. I wish I had the GPA (grade point average),
I'd be a note taker,'' said Erik Hemp, 23, an office employee of
Notes & Quotes, which opened in the fall of 1986 near Arizona State
in Tempe.
   Some educators feel the service encourages students to cut
class. On most campuses, the note-taking companies are required to
obtain professor approval before sending someone in, but the
universities generally do not have official policies on the matter.
   ``It's not banned by the dean. I would encourage (instructors)
to ban it and would never allow it in my own classes, but it never
came up for formal discussion,'' said James Casey, dean of the
College of Communications at the University of Illinois in
Champaign with 38,000 students.
   It did, however, come up for discussion in the history
department at University of Texas.
   ``It (Paradigm) was thrown out about four years ago,'' said
Brian Levack, acting chairman of the department. ``We thought it
discouraged people from coming to class and therefore we expressed
unanimous departmental disapproval.''
   The companies' main advertising vehicles are word-of-mouth and
leaflets circulated outside of classes.
   ``That's part of the territory and we never leaflet on Friday.
Kids blow off the classes then,'' said Hemp.
   Note takers earn most of their business in large introductory
lecture classes.
   ``Problem-solving classes aren't suitable for note taking,''
said Gary Magee, owner of Notes & Quotes in Champaign. ``We're
pretty limited in scope.''
   University of Texas biology professor Stephen Adolph is so fond
of the idea, he turns over his own lecture notes to Paradigm.
   ``I haven't found a good textbook for my class so it gives them
something to fall back on,'' he said. ``There are a lot of business
majors here who aren't interested in biology, but want to do well.
You can get an A in this class without attending.''
   He said many professors disapprove of the service because it's
disheartening to look out into a lecture hall that seats 300 and
see only 50 students.
   ``Sometimes it's a blow to the ego,'' Adolph said.

<HEAD>Does Consumer Confidence Mean Political Status Quo?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the election draws near, the question becomes
more significant: How much will economic views influence the votes
of Americans?
   A cynical axiom of politics suggests that people vote with their
pocketbooks, and that all issues debated in a campaign become
distilled into that one consideration seconds before the lever is
pulled.
   If that were so, it might be good news for incumbents, but it
may not be so this year because of an oddity of politics: Rather
than promoting their causes, many of the candidates have been doing
themselves in.
   That view comes from outside the political arena, from an
economist who has spent years studying the financial health, habits
and activities of Americans.
   Says economist William C. Dunkelberg: ``It seems that every
front-runner figured out a way to handicap himself, helping to
assure that victory would be more difficult if not impossible to
achieve, where once it may have appeared in the bag.''
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University School of Business and
Management, observes that if the president had the power to call
for elections at any time, right now would seem to be a good time.
   The reason: In September, 29 percent of all consumers said
government was doing a good job, the highest level in several
years. Nearly one-half felt economic policy was ``fair,'' and only
20 percent felt it was doing poorly.
   Such approval ratings, as measured by the University of
Michigan, are unheard of after eight years in office, Dunkelberg
says.
   Add to this the finding that 62.5 percent of the over-16
population is employed, and a relatively low and stable inflation
rate ``and you have the ingredients of a substantial victory for
the incumbents.''
   As if to nail it down, consumer optimisim is about as high as it
has been in the expansion, and the percentage of people reporting
they are financially better off than a year ago is near the
expansion peak.
   But, while Dunkelberg still feels the economic statistics
suggest the Republicans will be successful, he wonders about the
impact of political behavior on the economic evidence.
   ``The campaign has resembled a competititon between two boys for
the affection of one girl, with each trying to tell things about
the other that will make the young lady look less favorably on the
opponent,'' he says.
   The young lady, however, is looking for someone with courage,
says the dean. ``She is looking for a leader who talks positively
about the future, has a plan, is willing to take the `moral high
ground,' and of course can convey all this with a good TV image.''
   He concludes from this premise that three-fourths of the voters
wish they had a different choice, a situation that makes those
positive economic perceptions a bit less certain than they used to
be as guides to action.

<TEXT>
   After 65 years, the production lines
at one of Henry Ford's oldest plants will grind to a halt this
month and the factory that once made radiators for the Model T will
close its doors for good.
   For the last 2{ years, Ford employees who didn't accept
transfers to Plymouth, Mich., have dealt with the grim reality that
their jobs would soon be gone.
   ``I have to relate it to a person who has cancer. You have that
hope that you're going to be cured and finally you realize that
there's no hope. It's all gone,'' said James Roti Roti, the
president of United Auto Workers Local 930.
   The radiator and heater-core plant, which employed nearly 1,500
in 1973, is scheduled to close Nov. 30 in this upstate community of
less than 3,000, about 150 miles north of New York City.
   Ford is switching to aluminum radiators and heater cores instead
of using copper and brass. They will be made in Michigan.
   The historic plant _ located on a Hudson River site handpicked
by Henry Ford during a 1916 camping trip _ will be gutted and sold
for between $5 million and $6 million, said John C. Hazlett, Ford's
plant area manager.
   A stone displayed at the plant with the initials of Ford and his
camping companions _ Thomas Edison, John Burroughs and Harvey
Firestone Sr. _ may be donated to a museum, Hazlett said.
   When Ford built the Green Island plant, one of nine hydropower
plants he erected by 1925, the automaker believed that building
factories in rural areas would allow farmers to work during winter
months at his plants.
   ``Manufacturing, instead of being concentrated in a few centers,
should be and can be widely distributed,'' Ford wrote.
   How the members of Local 930 wish Ford's statement had withstood
the test of time. But company officials determined that to convert
the Green Island plant, which had revenues totaling more than $67.9
million in 1987, into an aluminum radiator facility would not be
worth the cost.
   It would cost $3 million more annually to make the products in
New York than in Michigan, Hazlett said.
   Workers say perhaps the one blessing of their dismal situation
was that they had plenty of advance warning about the shutdown. The
time helped some plan for the future and gave others a chance to
work overtime and save money.
   It also gave them more time to hold false hopes that things
would turn around.
   First, union members fought to keep the plant open, even going
so far as to leaflet shareholders at a Detroit meeting in 1986.
   They hoped for a new Ford product, a new owner, an
employee-owned factory _ and then set their minds on protecting as
best they could those who would inevitably be jobless.
   By October, radiator assembly line equipment had been torn out
of the 287,000-square-foot plant _ much already carted away.
Employees still working on heater core lines not far from the
windows that look out on the Hudson River spoke wistfully as they
looked at the empty spaces where their friends once worked.
   ``How can you feel, you know? You can't really feel anything.
You just wait for it (the shutdown) to happen,'' said Dennis
Bourdeau, 46, a 22-year plant veteran who doesn't know what he'll
be doing for a living as of Dec. 1.
   ``Everybody was hoping until the last minute,'' said Bourdeau.
   Productivity never dropped, even after layoffs and the shutdown
were announced. There was no sabotage.
   Most of the workers, who average in age at 50, have about 20
years of service and earn between $14 and $17 an hour, just wanted
to make it to retirement, said Ray Vaillancourt, 45, who's worked
there 23 years.
   Vaillancourt opted not to take the transfer offer to Michigan
and planned to make his part-time job as a charter bus driver full
time.
   Workers aren't bitter, Vaillancourt said.
   The mood in the plant, said Bourdeau, is mostly just
disappointment.
   ``We have met our schedules and our quality has actually
improved year over year for the last four or five years,'' conceded
Hazlett, the plant area manager.
   When the shutdown was announced in 1985, the 425 workers weren't
covered by job-security provisions and compromises had to be sought.
   Transfers were offered to almost every employee, and 160 took
the jobs in Plymouth, Hazlett said. Job-training programs were
offered and an early retirement plan, which begins at age 50 even
if a worker gets laid off at a younger age, was also offered.
   Ford and the UAW had also worked out education and training
programs, ranging from high school equivalency schooling to truck
driving.
   The training programs took four to five years to get into place,
Hazlett said.
   ``You just can't do it in 60 days,'' said Hazlett, in a
reference to new federal legislation requiring 60 days' notice of
an impending layoff or shutdown.
   Don Sherman, a spokesman for Ford's climate control division in
Michigan, said the company has had a longstanding policy that
approximately two years' advance notice is given before a plant
closes, so the law does not affect the way Ford handles such
situations.
   ``Let's face it, we don't want to see the plant close,'' union
leader Roti Roti said. ``But if there has to be a plant closing,
this is the way to do it.''

<HEAD>Tacoma Officials Back WPPSS Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tacoma officials today approved a proposed
$221 million settlement in the Washington Public Power Supply
System securities fraud case, and Gov. Booth Gardner recommended
that the state pay $10 million toward the settlement.
   The settlement, subject to approval by 13 other utilities, was
proposed by bondholders' lawyers to resolve a case inspired by the
largest municipal bond default in history.
   The only utility that would remain as a defendant would be
Snohomish County Public Utility District, which contracted for the
biggest share, 13 percent, on two WPPSS nuclear power plants.
   The trial was recessed last week in Tucson, Ariz., when
attorneys reported a settlement was possible. It is scheduled to
resume Wednesday.
   Construction was halted on two WPPSS nuclear plants in 1982 and
WPPSS later defaulted on the $2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance
construction of the plants, precipitating a flood of lawsuits.
   A class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders and
Chemical Bank of New York, a trustee for bondholders, claim the
defendants conspired to lie and hide information that might have
discouraged potential investors.
   In a resolution from the Tacoma City Council and the city
utilities board, Tacoma agreed to pay $40.2 million as its share of
the settlement.
   Ted Coates, Tacoma City Light's director of utilities, said the
agreement was also contingent on federal approval of a $35 million
payment from the Bonneville Power Administration.
   Bonneville, which backed financing of WPPSS's three other
nuclear power plants, markets power from federal dams in the
Northwest, and is the region's largest power broker with an annual
budget of $3 billion.
   In Olympia, Gardner and Attorney General Ken Eikenberry today
recommended that the state contribute $10 million in a lawsuit
settlement.
   ``We believe that this will finally put the WPPSS issue behind
us,'' Gardner and Eikenberry said in a letter to state legislators.
   Washington state is not a defendant in the case on trial, but a
settlement should end a separate lawsuit against the state
involving the same plaintiffs, who are suing to recover $7.5
billion _ the $2.3 billion default plus interest.
   The proposed state involvement in the case would require
approval of the Legislature. Gardner and Eikenberry said they would
ask for an appropriation in the supplemental budget when the
lawmakers convene next January.
   The 13 other public utility districts involved in the settlement
proposed by the bondholders were expected to vote soon on the
proposal.
   Besides the utilities, remaining defendants include two
engineering firms and a financial consulting firm. There has been
no talk of settlement involving the professional firms, and
attorneys with two of the firms said last week that no talks were
going on involving their clients.

<HEAD>Stockholder Suit Against Middle South Sent Back To Trial Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Monday an
appeals court decision reviving a suit by stockholders who claim
Middle South Utilities Inc. hid its shaky financial condition to
inflate the value of its stock.
   The high court refused without comment to hear an appeal of a
decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that a federal
district judge dismissed the lawsuit without sufficient explanation.
   The 5th Circuit's ruling in June said that if U.S. District
Judge Adrian Duplantier again dismisses the suit, he must explain
why in detail so that appeal courts have something on which to base
their review.
   Spokesman Cyril Guerrera said Middle South did not have any
immediate comment on the Supreme Court's action.
   Middle South, based in New Orleans, is an electric utility
holding company that owns Louisiana Power & Light Co., New Orleans
Power & Light Co., Mississippi Power & Light Co. and Arkansas Power
& Light Co. A fifth subsidiary, Systems Energy Resources Inc., runs
Grand Gulf _ a nuclear power plant in Mississippi which sells power
to all four utilities.
   The company has been beset by money troubles for years because
of Grand Gulf, though it announced last month that it would pay its
first quarterly dividend since July 1985.
   Rita Isquith and other stockholders filed suit in August 1985.
Middle South announced the following month that it was near
bankruptcy and that _ for the first time in its 36-year history _
it would not be paying dividends on common stock.
   The lawsuits claimed that Middle South deliberately withheld
information from investors about its deteriorating financial
condition. The stockholders said they were suing on behalf of
anyone who bought stock between Dec. 7, 1982, and Aug. 16, 1985, a
period of heavy trading.
   The company's troubles center on its $6 billion investment in
nuclear power. In addition to Grand Gulf, near Port Gibson, Miss.,
LP&L owns Waterford 3 near Taft, La., about 20 miles up the
Mississippi River from New Orleans.
   There were huge cost overruns and repeated construction delays
in building both plants; Middle South has said it does not expect
to complete a second Grand Gulf plant.
   Middle South has obtained rate increases for the two working
plants, but stockholders have had to absorb some of the plants'
costs as part of the deals cut with regulators.

   Share prices finished lower Monday after a
featureless session on the London Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 6
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,852.4.
   Volume was light, as 348.5 million shares changed hands,
compared with 484.2 million shares Friday.
   ``The market is rather finely balanced at this point, so without
a fresh set of economic justifications, we're liable to stay put,''
one dealer said.
   Dealers also noted a jittery atmosphere amid expectations that
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson would make a pivotal
economic speech on Tuesday.
   A partial recovery on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
industrial average recovered more than 13 points after sinking 15
points, helped London equities off their intraday lows, dealers
said. By the close of the London day, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 2.49 points at 2,147.40.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 7.2 points to 1,501.7.
The Financial Times 500 share index fell 2.26 to 1,054.73.

   The dollar ended mostly higher Monday in foreign
exchange trading in Europe, as reported intervention by the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan lifted the dollar above its
lows.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Dealers said the dollar fell on low volume in Tokyo, despite
reports that the Bank of Japan intervened to push the dollar higher.
   Reports that the Fed bought dollars for yen twice during the
European day pushed the dollar to its session highs before it
drifted back.
   Dealers said the intervention succeeded in supporting the dollar
for the day, but they said bearish sentiment toward the dollar is
widespread.
   Several dealers said they felt the Fed intervened on behalf of
the Japanese central bank, and felt the intervention was not meant
to turn market sentiment around.
   ``The intervention may be enough to steady the market for the
week,'' said Steve Barrow, corporate advisor at Chemical Bank,
``but it wasn't enough to turn around market sentiment.''
   Bearish sentiment stems from disappointment that the U.S. trade
deficit has not shown enough signs of improvement, while slower
U.S. economic growth has disappointed those looking for higher U.S.
interest rates, dealers said.
   Dealers said the dollar's movement Monday was accentuated by a
thin market, since many corporate players have moved to the
sidelines before the U.S. presdential elections next week, while
markets in France, the Philippines, Taiwan and Ireland were closed
Monday for a holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 1.08 Japanese yen to a closing 125.00 yen.
Later in London, it rose slightly to 125.45 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7678 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7680 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.7810 West German marks, up from 1.7755; 1.4995
Swiss francs, up from 1.4970; 6.0800 French francs, up from 6.0750;
2.0000 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0010; 1,320.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,321.50; and 1.2204 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2035.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $411.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $410.50 an ounce late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to
$412.25 an ounce compared with $411.25 late Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 18 cents to close at $414.46 a
troy ounce.
   Silver bullion prices held steady on the London market where the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.31 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Friday.

   British businessman Brian C. Beazer disclosed
Monday preliminary agreements to sell three units of Koppers Co.

   Beazer, looking to pay down debt from his $1.8 billion takeover
of Koppers, said the units are Koppers International Canada Ltd.,

reinforced construction material.
   The identity of the buyers was withheld.
   The three units were part of the construction and construction

   Beazer said last week he intends to break up the company's
chemicals business and sell the various parts. A management group
earlier this year offered $660 million for the business, but the
deal fell through. Beazer said he expects to receive more than $660
million by selling the business in segments.

<HEAD>Decline in Commercial Building Pushes Down New Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New construction contracting fell 3 percent in
September, pulled down by a decline in commerical and industrial
projects, a business research concern reported Monday.
   It was the third consecutive monthly decline in total new
construction starts, now valued at $238 billion on an annualized
basis, according to the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information
Services Co.
   All of the latest month's decline was concentrated in commercial
and industrial projects, the report said.
   George A. Christie, a McGraw-Hill economist, said continuing
vacancies in commercial buildings and an overall reduction in
public spending had reversed a five-year expansion of building
activity. Christie predicted the downward trend in new contracting
would continue.
   ``Newly started construction is on its way to a 3 percent
decline in 1988, with the prospect of a further dip next year,'' he
said.
   Christie said a seasonally adjusted 7 percent dip in
non-residential building in September seemed inconsistent with
1988's surge of manufacturing.
   Market fundamentals indicate industrial plant construction
should be up sharply, given a capacity utilization of 84 percent in
the nation's factories, he said.
   ``Instead, contracting so far in 1988 is running 10 percent
behind last year,'' he said.
   Residential construction, meanwhile, remained at an annual rate
of $115.7 billion in September, unchanged from the previous month,
due in part to relatively stable mortgage interest rates.
   The value of contracts for non-building construction, such as
public works and utilities, increased 1 percent to an annualized
rate of $40.1 billion last month, the report said. An increase in
highway and other public works construction was partially offset by
a decline in utility projects.
   For the first nine months, new construction starts on an
unadjusted basis totaled $191.7 billion, down 3 percent from the
same period in 1987.
   The South has remained the weakest building sector in 1988, with
6 percent fewer construction starts than in 1987. The northeastern
and north-central areas of the United States also showed declines,
of 1 percent and 2 percent, respectivetly. Building in the nation's
western region remained unchanged.

   The Boeing Co. said Monday its third-quarter
profit climbed 38.5 percent on a 4.5 percent increase in revenue.
   The aerospace concern said it earned $144 million, or 94 cents a
share, in the third quarter compared with $104 million, or 67 cents
a share, in tne same period a year earlier.
   Third-quarter sales rose to $3.72 billion from $3.56 billion in
the third quarter of 1987.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Boeing reported it earned
$440 million, or $2.88 per share, up 29.8 percent from $339
million, or $2.18 per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales rose 11 percent to $12.1 billion from $10.9
billion a year earlier.
   Boeing attributed the improved earnings to higher sales volume,
lower levels of research, development and other new-business
expenses, lower federal income-tax rates and increased income from
other sources.
   Those items were partially offset by ``significant performance
problems on several military aircraft programs,'' increased costs
associated with commuter aircraft, and increased ``cost-share
expenditures on government contracts.''
   During the third quarter, 24 customers announced orders for 100
jet transports and 10 de Havilland turboprop commuter planes valued
at $5.1 billion, Boeing said, compared with $3.8 billion in orders
last year.
   For the first nine months of the year, 497 jetliners and 45
turboprop aircraft were ordered, valued at $23.1 billion. That
compares with 267 jetliners and 40 turboprops, valued at $14.9
billion, in the first three quarters of 1987, Boeing said.
   Through Monday, Boeing's total announced 1988 orders stand at a
record 560 jetliners, valued at about $25.8 billion. The latest
order, also announced Monday, was Royal Air Maroc's for 10 737
jetliners and options on 10 more.

<HEAD>Jordan Picked as Seventh Celebrity Athlete on Wheaties Box</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael Jordan was dressed to play basketball
Monday, but instead, he talked about breakfast cereal, posed with a
picture of a cereal box almost as tall as he, and got down on one
knee with an actual-size box in hand.
   Such was the Chicago Bulls star's inauguration as only the
seventh ``celebrity athlete'' to be pictured on the front of
packages of Wheaties, the General Mills Inc. cereal marketed as
``The Breakfast of Champions.'
   Jim Nuckols, product manager, told reporters Jordan was ``a man
of real character and integrity,'' fitting for the positive image
the product tries to have.
   ``I'm very happy to be part of the Wheaties organization,'' said
Jordan, clad in his No. 23 Bulls jersey and black sweat pants. ``A
lot of people would love to be in my shoes.''
   Many might also want to have his bank account, which could swell
with the Wheaties deal. But Jordan and company officials said that
terms were not being disclosed.
   What they did disclose was that Jordan's picture would be
printed on at least 12 million to 14 million boxes of the cereal.
   Others who have contracted with Minneapolis-based General Mills
for the Wheaties limelight, beginning in 1956, include pole vaulter
Bob Richards, decathlon star Bruce Jenner, gymnast Mary Lou Retton,
baseball player Pete Rose, football's Walter Payton and tennis star
Chris Evert.
   Richards, now a clergyman in Texas, first adorned Wheaties boxes
before Jordan was born 25 years ago, and Jordan admits that as a
child, he didn't know about the cereal.
   ``We had a big family,'' said the North Carolina native, and
pennies had to be watched. ``We used to eat wheat puffs _ remember
those in the big bags that could last ... through five or six kids?
That's what we had.''
   On the back of a series of Wheaties boxes will be installments
of ``The Michael Jordan Story,'' tracing his roots from an awkward
kid to pro basketball's Most Valuable Player last season.
   Actually, ``a dozen or two'' athletes have been pictured on the
front of Wheaties boxes over the years, but Jordan is only one of
seven ``celebrity athletes'' to get the honor through major deals
with the company, said Kathryn Newman, public relations supervisor
for General Mills.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Costs Have Risen, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although most basic interstate telephone rates
have remained unchanged since spring, extra charges for directory
assistance and other adjustments have raised overall long-distance
calling costs, according to a new survey of phone rates.
   The consumer survey by the Telecommunications Research and
Action Center, a nonprofit group that tracks long-distance rates
for residential and business callers, found some carriers have
reduced the number of free information calls and cut the hours of
the cheapest calling period.
   ``Rates haven't been going down and there have been all sorts of
adjustments that have been nibbling at the edges to maximize
revenue from each subscriber,'' said Samuel Simon, a consultant to
the center.
   ``This is a pattern we expect to see in the future,'' he added.
   Interstate long-distance rates are due for another round of
reductions soon to reflect savings from a 60-cents-per-month
increase in the line charge subscribers pay to help maintain the
local phone network. The charge will be added to the existing $2.60
monthly line charge on Dec. 1.
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. has proposed to the Federal
Communications Commission that its rates drop by an average 3.8
percent to reflect the line-charge increase. AT&T competitors do
not have to cut their rates, but they often do to remain
competitive with the industry leader.
   TRAC's survey found increases ranging from 1 percent to 5
percent for most long-distance carriers since its last survey on
March 31.
   Among the increases reflected in the group's rate-comparison
chart were a reduction by AT&T and MCI in the number of free
long-distance information calls from two to one and MCI's increase
in the cost of such calls from 55 cents to 58 cents, TRAC said.
   Also, Allnet has begun applying evening rates rather than the
cheaper night-weekend rates to its Saturday night 5 p.m.-11 p.m.
calling period, and the company is applying a 5 percent surcharge
on callers using its equal access service if they don't have an
account with Allnet, TRAC said.
   In addition, Western Union raised its rates by about 5 percent
since the last survey, TRAC said.
   TRAC advises residential and business subscribers to re-evaluate
their long-distance service periodically to see whether there are
lower-cost alternatives.
   ``The problem is that consumers made their decision once, and
have settled into one company and plan,'' said David Wagenhauser, a
TRAC lawyer who managed the survey.
   The TRAC survey compares the cost of long-distance monthly bills
with 33, 123 and 303 interstate calls of a variety of distances.
The cost of three long-distance directory assistance calls was also
figured into the bills.
   For the 33-calls comparison, the cheapest plan was US Sprint
standard rates at $33.60, US Sprint 10333 and 10777 access rates at
$34.20, MCI standard rates and 10222 access at $34.88, AT&T's Reach
Out America Day Option at $35.09, and AT&T's Reach Out America
Evening Option at $35.27.
   ITT standard rates were next at $35.37, followed by AT&T's Reach
Out America Basic Plan, $35.45; Allnet standard rates, $35.78; AT&T
standard rates and MidAmerican standard rates, $35.97; ITT 10488
access longer distance, $36.04; and Allnet 10444 access, $37.51.
   When a ``typical'' residential bill of 380 minutes was
calculated with the bulk of the calls figured at night-weekend
rates, the cheapest plan was MidAmerican standard rates, followed
by Reach Out America Evening Option, Sprint standard rates, Reach
Out America Day Option and Sprint 10333 and 10777 access.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Urge Reagan To Continue Tariff on Canadian Shingles,
Shakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen Northwest lawmakers urged President
Reagan on Monday to maintain tariffs on cedar shakes and shingles
imported from Canada imposed almost 30 months ago.
   The lawmakers, in a letter to Reagan, said that dropping the
duty rather than proceeding with plans to gradually phase it out
``would result in shake and shingle prices plummeting as Canadian
imports pour in.
   ``We are confident that if relief (for the domestic industry) is
continued for the full five-year period as you announced in May
1986, the industry will be able to meet Canadian competition head
on without additional government assistance.''
   In announcing the tariffs, Reagan has said they were necessary
to allow the industry, mostly based in Washington state and Oregon,
to adjust to competition by modernizing mills and developing
alternatives to traditional cedar shakes and shingles.
   The administration imposed a five-year program that called for a
35 percent tariff during the first 30 months, a 20 percent tariff
between 30 months and 54 months and an 8 percent tariff for the
final six months.
   Reagan said it was his ``intention'' to maintain the tariffs for
the entire period ``if general market conditions continue to
warrant relief and if the domestic producers have begun to make
reasonable progress toward adjustment during the first 30-month
period.''
   But Reagan also asked the International Trade Commission to
report to him on the ``probable economic effect'' on the domestic
shake and shingle industry if all tariffs were removed after 30
months.
   The commission in early October was unable to reach agreement on
whether to recommend a continuation of the tariff program as
planned, with three commissioners voting to drop all tariffs
immediately and three supporting thegradual phaseout originally
envisioned.
   The lawmakers warned that unless the tariffs were maintained as
planned ``it will cause extreme hardship on the industry.''
   Many mill owners have purchased or ordered timber in
anticipation of the continuation of the tariffs and thus have no
way to reduce their costs to compete against cheaper Canadian
products if the tariffs were dropped, the lawmakers said.
   Since the tariffs were imposed, the lawmakers said the Canadian
share of the market has dropped from 73 percent to 59 percent,
employment in the domestic industry is up 26 percent, wages up 39
percent, production up 41 percent and mill productivity up 12
percent.
   The letter was signed by Democratic Reps. Don Bonker, Al Swift
and Mike Lowry of Washington state, Les AuCoin and Peter DeFazio of
Oregon and Richard Stallings of Idaho.
   Republican House members signing the letter were John Miller of
Washington state, Denny Smith and Bob Smith of Oregon and Larry
Craig of Idaho.
   Senators signing the letter were Democrat Brock Adams of
Washington state and Republicans James McClure and Steve Symms of
Idaho.

<HEAD>Copper Hits Record High; Demand Intensifies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices hit all-time highs Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as demand for tight supplies of the metal
intensified.
   On other markets, platinum futures surged while gold and silver
were mixed; energy futures fell; grains and soybeans advanced;
livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.
   The thinly traded contract for November delivery of copper
reached $1.4775 a pound, well above the 1{-week-old record Comex
high of $1.465, and settled at $1.4740, 2.95 cents higher than
Friday's final price. December copper finished at $1.4115, up 1.45
cents.
   Analysts said buying was prompted in part by the London Metal
Exchange's report of a 9,200-metric-ton drop in its warehouse
supplies of copper last week. The market had expected a decline of
5,000 to 7,000 metric tons.
   Meanwhile, a miner's strike in Peru ended its second week on
Monday, increasing concerns that supply problems could persist into
next year.
   ``The Peruvian situation is getting more critical every day,''
said William O'Neill, director of research with Elders Futures Inc.
in New York.
   Meanwhile user demand for copper in the United States remained
``very strong,'' dispelling any fears that last week's price
decline signified a new trend in the market.
   ``We're seeing both supply and demand developments that are
bullish for the market,'' O'Neill said. ``We had a nice little
technical consolidation last week and now it's roaring back on a
very constructive set of fundamentals.''
   Platinum futures posted strong gains on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, partly in response to news of an agreement among 12
Western European nations to strengthen their pollution
restrictions, analysts said.
   Platinum is a key element in many automobile and industrial
pollution-control systems.
   The Comex gold and silver markets were fairly quiet, reflecting
the negative price impact of the stronger dollar and the weaker
energy market, analysts said.
   Gold settled 20 cents lower to 20 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $415.10 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3
cents to 1.4 cents higher with December at $6.348 a troy ounce.
Platinum was $4.80 to $6.80 higher with January at $550.60 a troy
ounce.
   Crude oil futures fell on the New York Merc following reports
that Saudi Arabia was prepared to dump huge quantities of oil onto
the market unless Iran and Iraq put aside their differences and
join other OPEC members in an agreement to curb their oil exports,
said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents to 43 cents
lower with December at $13.58 a barrel; heating oil was .20 cent to
.84 cent lower with November at 42.62 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.52 cents lower to .14 cent higher with November at
50.24 cents a gallon.
   Live cattle gained sharply in a technically inspired rally while
feeder cattle were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Hogs were mixed on spillover buying from the cattle pits and
selling stemming from weaker cash markets, analysts said.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .77 cent higher with December at
74.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .22 cent
higher with November at 82.02 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with December at 41.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .07 cent to .48 cent lower with February
at 46.52 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade, reflecting positive chart signals and expectations
of a rise in demand.
   Wheat settled 3} cents to 5} cents higher with December at
$4.15} a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 3{ cents higher with
December at $2.82\ a bushel; oats were } cent to 2 cents higher
with December at $2.36 a bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents lower to 8{

   Stock-index futures fell modestly on the Chicago Merc, where the

.45 point lower at 279.10.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose broadly in active U.S. trading
Monday after the Federal Reserve intervened and bought the U.S.
currency to help increase its value.
   Gold prices were narrowly mixed in U.S. trading after rising
abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted bullion at
$412.20 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down a nickel from its late
Friday price.
   U.S.-based foreign exchange brokers said the dollar got a boost
from significant purchases by the Federal Reserve, in what appeared
to be a message that the U.S. central bank won't let the currency
fall below recent levels.
   ``The Fed sold Japanese yen and bought dollars,'' said Renato
Strauss, a trader at the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer & Co.,
a Swiss banking concern. ``They made clear they were in the
market.''
   The Fed does not comment on its currency-market activities,
which are conducted via a select group of dealers.
   But word gets out quickly when the Fed is buying or selling,
either because dealers tell each other or because the size of a
purchase or sale is so large it can only have been done by a large
central bank.
   Currency strategists were divided over the dollar's longer-term
trend. Many believe the dollar will decline despite central bank
intervention if pessimism about the U.S. economy intensifies. But
others say the dollar already has declined significantly over the
past few weeks and is due for a rebound.
   James Chorek, a currency analyst at the commodities futures firm
MMS International in Chicago, said he believed the dollar would
continue rising over the next few weeks, based on his calculations
of supply and demand and other technical factors influencing its
value.
   ``Overall to me, the dollar looks very good at this point,'' he
said. ``It's moving up against everything.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.08 Japanese yen to 125.00 yen, but
rose later in London to 125.45 yen. By the time trading ended in
New York the dollar fetched 125.67 yen, up from 125.63 yen late
Friday.
   The dollar strengthened against the British pound in London,
where sterling fetched $1.7678 vs. $1.7680 late Friday. Later in
New York the pound traded at $1.7684, weaker than its $1.7720 value
late Friday.
   Other late-dollar rates in New York vs. rates late Friday:
1.7873 West German marks, up from 1.7719; 1.5074 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4937; 1.2247 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2037; 6.0913 French
francs, up from 6.0525; and 1,328.25 Italian lire, up from 1,319.25.
   Other late-dollar rates in Europe vs. rates late Friday: 1.7810
marks, up from 1.7755; 1.4995 Swiss francs, up from 1.4970; 6.0800
French francs, up from 6.0750; 2.0000 Dutch guilders, down from
2.0010; 1,320.00 Italian lire, down from 1,321.50; and 1.2204
Canadian dollars, up from 1.2035.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery
rose 30 cents an ounce to $412.70.
   Earlier in London gold rose 75 cents an ounce to $411.25; in
Zurich it rose $1 to $412.25; and in Hong Kong it rose 18 cents to
$414.46.
   Silver for current delivery rose 1.4 cents a troy ounce to
$6.303 on the New York Comex. In London silver traded at $6.31,
unchanged from Friday.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department on Monday turned over to
a private buyer the government's only commercial synthetic fuels
operation, a North Dakota coal gasification plant spawned by the
energy crises of the late 1970s.
   The price being paid by the buyer, Basin Electric Cooperative,
represents 13 cents to 40 cents on every dollar of the government's
investment, depending upon whose analysis is accepted.
   The one-of-a-kind plant near Beulah, N.D., has been a technical
success, producing an average of 142 million cubic feet a day of
high-BTU synthetic natural gas for four interstate pipelines.
   Built for $2.1 billion, of which $1.5 billion was from loans
guaranteed by the federal government, the plant and an associated
mine passed into government ownership three years ago when its
private operators defaulted on the loans.
   The government is still subsidizing four projects started by the
defunct Synthetic Fuels Corp.
   Eight companies submitted bids for the plant. Basin, a
wholesaler of electricity to rural electric cooperatives, won with
a bid valued by the department at almost $600 million, a large part
of which will be paid from future gas sales. This would represent
40 cents on the dollar of repaid loans.
   However, the General Accounting Office said last week that the
bid should be valued at $200 million _ still better than continuing
to run the plant, an option GAO said would yield a revenue stream
worth the equivalent of $166 million in a lump sum today.
   The chief difference between the two bid values is $300 million
in production tax credits granted by Congress that Basin has agreed
to waive. GAO said the Energy Department should not count the $300
million, but the department insists it is a legitimate benefit to
the government.
   At a closing ceremony at the Energy Department, Deputy Secretary
Joseph Salgado said, ``We fundamentally do not believe the
government belongs in running the project. We believe that you, as
businessmen in the community in North Dakota, have a better sense
of how to run the business than we do in Washington, D.C. That's
fundamental to the principles Ronald Reagan has brought to this
government.''
   Basin Electric was selected because, among other reasons, it
offered the best chance to keep the plant running, Salgado said.
   Robert F. McPhail, general manager of the cooperative, said,
``With this signing we feel it is on to bigger and better things
for the Great Basin Project, for Basin Electric and for the federal
government.''
   The sale contract provides that in certain circumstances of
extremely low gas prices, Basin Electric may return the plant to
the government.
   J. Allen Wampler, assistant secretary for fossil energy, said he
did not expect the government ever to have to take over the plant
again.
   ``I think the worst thing that could possibly happen would be
the plant would be mothballed by Basin ... until prices rose,''
Wampler said.

   The stock market drifted to a mostly lower
finish Monday in dull trading, as Wall Street recovered from last
week's takeover frenzy and waited for new developments.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.24 points to
2,148.65. The blue-chip indicator remained slightly lower through
most of the trading session.
   Declining issues edged out advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
835 issues down, 626 up and 496 unchanged.
   Stocks came under some pressure from an early decline in the
dollar, but mostly just slipped under their own weight, analysts
said.
   ``There's nothing around to stimulate it,'' said Larry Wachtel,
an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``There's all kinds
of incentives to sit around on one's rear end and await
developments.''
   Many participants were said to be sidelined, awaiting Tuesday's
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policymaking arm and U.S.
unemployment figures for October, scheduled for release on Friday.
The fast-approaching presidential election also has dampened
activity.
   Some observers expect the central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee _ meeting just a week before the election _ to decide to
keep credit policy and interest rates stable. Recent signs that
inflationary pressures are easing would make the Fed loathe to push
interest rates higher, and could even persuade it to lower them,
some analysts believe.
   ``The thinking is there will be no need to raise interest
rates,'' said Monte Gordon, an analyst for Dreyfus Corp.
   That view gained further credence Monday when Martha R. Seger, a
member of the Fed's Board of Governors, estimated that the nation's
economy has slowed in the third quarter and will grow by 1 percent
to 2 percent next year.
   Seger told the Economic Club of Detroit that recent economic
data have allayed fears of rekindled inflation.
   Stock prices got a brief boost in the afternoon from a rebound
in the dollar, market watchers said. The Fed came into the
foreign-exchange market at least twice Monday to bolster the dollar
by buying the U.S. currency and selling Japanese yen, according to
exchange dealers.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 143.46 million shares,
down slightly from 146.30 million in last Friday's session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market,
totaled 170.60 million shares.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, RJR Nabisco fell 1\ to
83}. The company is the object of a $20.3 billion bid from
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. Sears Roebuck, which
announced a restructuring, lost 1~ at 41}, General Motors was down
{ at 83] and Mobil slipped [ to 44].
   Food giant Kraft, which agreed Sunday to be acquired by tobacco
company Philip Morris for $13.1 billion, soared 7 to 103{.
Pillsbury was up { at 60.
   The NYSE's composite index edged up 0.15 to 156.94.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 0.59 to 321.26, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.44 at 278.97.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped
0.80 to 300.95.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
closed at 382.46, down 0.33.
   The Wilshire Associates Equity Index, the market value of NYSE,
American and OTC issues, rose by $2.75 billion.

<HEAD>UAW Members Ratify Contract with Caterpillar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union workers at Caterpillar Inc. plants in
five states have ratified a new three-year contract with the
company by a 3-to-1 margin, the United Auto Workers announced
Monday.
   Karl Mantyla, a United Auto Workers spokesman in Detroit, said
73 percent of Caterpillar's 17,500 blue-collar workers approved the
contract hammered out during nearly three months of negotiations at
a St. Louis-area hotel.
   ``We call it an overwhelming margin,'' Mantyla said. ``It's a
higher margin than a lot of recent contracts, although it wasn't as
high as Deere's recent contract, which got 90 percent approval. But
we're pleased with it.''
   Only the 222 members of Local 215 in Davenport, Iowa, rejected
the pact with 91 percent of the membership turning it down.
   Union leaders believe the pact ``meets the key goals that we set
at the start of negotiations,'' Mantyla said.
   ``Greatly improved job and income security will be provided to
UAW-Caterpillar workers under the new agreement,'' said Bill
Casstevens, UAW secretary-treasurer.
   ``The pact addresses the unique needs of active and laid-off
Caterpillar workers, while meeting the economic pattern set by the
UAW for negotiations in the agricultural and heavy construction
equipment industry.''
   The contract talks came as Peoria-based Caterpillar, the world's
largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, was building its
best year since the company was formed in 1925. The company has
reported two consecutive quarters of record sales, and record
profits in the last three months.
   The contract calls for a wage increase of 3 percent the first
year followed by 3 percent lump-sum bonuses in each of the last two
years. It includes bonuses for night shift employees.
   It also gives 100 percent job security for 85 percent of the
workforce, as well as gains in pension and early retirement
benefits. Under the contract, which expires Sept. 30, 1991,
Caterpillar agreed to a moratorium on any plant closings.

   Coca-Cola Enterprises announced Monday it has
agreed to sell its Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Mid-America, which
serves portions of seven Midwestern states, for about $285 million.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises said it had signed a letter of intent to
sell Mid-America to Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group Inc. of
Chattanooga, Tenn.
   Completion of the deal is expected by the end of the year,
according to a statement.
   The company being sold serves a territory that includes the
cities of Kansas City and Omaha and portions of Iowa, Missouri,
Kansas, Illinois, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Minnesota.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises said it expects the proposed sale to
result in a one-time gain of approximately $110 million before tax.
   In addition to the sale, Coca-Cola Enterprises announced Monday
a share repurchase program of up to 25 million shares of its common
stock.
   ``We have always stated that CCE would consider divesting
bottling companies as part of its overall net acquisition
strategy,'' said Brian G. Dyson, chief executive officer of
Coca-Cola Enterprises.
   ``We believe that the use of part of the proceeds of such a
divestiture in a share repurchase program is one of the ways we can
deliver value to our shareholders while implementing CCE's
corporate strategy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Illinois Says Deceptive Practices Used in Drought Insurance Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Department of Insurance
charged Monday that a subsidiary of the Chubb Insurance Group used
deceptive and unfair practices to sell so-called ``drought
insurance'' to more than 1,000 Illinois farmers.
   Administrative charges filed by the department after a
four-month investigation alleged nine separate violations of state
law by the subsidiary, Federal Insurance Co.
   Federal sold insurance against inadequate rain _ a type of
policy not authorized by state law _ to farmers who thought they
were buying coverage for extensive drought-related crop losses, the
department said.
   ``Even if they had issued policies to every farmer who applied
for and paid premium for this coverage, it could have meant a
windfall for some farmers and provided no protection at all for
others even if their comparative crop losses were identical,'' said
Robert Enoex, chief attorney for the Insurance Department.
   State Insurance Director John Washburn said the charges, if
proved, ``would demonstrate a shocking abuse of and disregard for
Illinois consumers and Illinois insurance laws by a member company
of an insurance group whose reputation, at least prior to this
problem, had been considered to be among the best in the industry.''
   Chubb officials had not seen the charges and so could not
comment on them, said Gail Devlin, a senior vice president of the
group, in a telephone interview from New York City.
   Washburn scheduled a hearing on the charges Dec. 1 in
Springfield.
   If the charges are proved, Washburn said, Federal could be
required to pay $16.8 million in claims to 702 farmers, and also
might face suspension or revocation of its insurance license.
   Insurance agents in the Midwest advertised the insurance and
accepted premiums in late spring, when many farmers already
suspected that a dry growing season was in store.
   The state charged that Federal allowed farmers to assume they
had received coverage after filing an application and paying a
premium, but then began rejecting the applications nearly halfway
through the three-month term of the policies.
   Federal also arbitrarily changed the amount of insurance it
planned to make available in each of several different Midwest
regions ``whenever it seemed to fit their needs,'' said Richard
Carlson, assistant director of the Insurance Department.
   Enoex compared the company's offer of drought insurance last
summer to ``offering to sell fire insurance to a person whose
building is burning,'' and said Federal's subsequent decision not
to offer policies was ``much like tossing gasoline on the fire.''
   Federal has paid nearly $6 million in claims to 246 Illinois
farmers, and has made an additional $1.4 million in ``goodwill
payments'' to 720 farmers who applied for but didn't receive
coverage, the Insurance Department said.
   Farmers from all over the country who paid premiums are party to
a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati that
seeks to force Chubb to extend coverage to anyone who paid a
premium and still wants the insurance.
   This past weekend, Minnesota officials said they had reached a
$5.25 million settlement with Chubb and Federal over drought
insurance sold to Minnesota farmers last spring.
   Last month, Chubb said Federal paid out $20 million for drought
claims in seven Midwestern states and another $11 million in
goodwill payments top farmers who applied but did not receive
coverage.
   Chubb said the 8,800 applications for $350 million in coverage
far exceeded the $43 million in coverage it could provide.

<HEAD>Stroh's To Bottle, Distribute California Cooler In The United
States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Stroh Companies Inc. and Brown-Forman Corp.
announced an agreement Monday under which the Detroit beermaker
will bottle and distribute California Cooler wine cooler in the
United States.
   Stroh planned to begin blending and bottling California Cooler
at several of its facilities by March 1989, when Brown-Forman was
to close its plant in Stockton, Calif., the companies said in a
statement.
   Brown-Forman planned to grant Stroh its exclusive license to
produce and market California Cooler in the U.S. within 60 days,
the statement said.
   But the Louisville, Ky.-based corporation would retain worldwide
ownership of the brand and would continue manufacturing and
marketing California Cooler overseas, it said.
   California Cooler was the first of the major wine cooler brands,
paving the way for the creation of a $1 billion-plus category of
fizzy, fruit-flavored alcoholic beverages in the early 1980s with
advertising that featured California beach parties and 60's music
classics.
   But it slipped from its first-place rank in the category in
1986, displaced by the Bartles & Jaymes brand from the E&J Gallo
Winery and Seagram's Wine Coolers from Seagram Beverage Co.
   The agreement with Stroh called for Brown-Forman to receive
royalty payments based on the overall performance of a new Stroh
division that will sell White Mountain Cooler as well as California
Cooler, the statement said.
   ``We are pleased to be adding the original cooler brand to our
strong lineup of beverages,'' said Peter Stroh, chief executive
officer of Stroh Companies. ``We believe the cooler segment offers
very attractive long-term possibilities for Stroh and
Brown-Forman.''
   ``California Cooler's competitive position and profitability
will be greatly enhanced due to significant manufacturing and
physical distribution efficiencies that will result from a
combination with Stroh's leading beverage products,'' said W.L.
Lyons Brown Jr., Brown-Forman chairman.
   Stroh, the nation's third largest brewer, sells Stroh's, Stroh
Light, Old Milwaukee, Schlitz Malt Liquor, Schaefer and other
brands of beer and markets White Mountain Cooler and Sundance
Natural Juice Sparkler.
   Brown-Forman manufactures and markets products including Jack
Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, Canadian Mist, Southern Comfort, Korbel
California Champagne, Lenox China and Crystal and Hartmann luggage.

<HEAD>Chapter 11 Plan Accepted By Creditors, Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creditors and shareholders have voted to
approve the reorganization of Allis-Chalmers Corp. under Chapter 11
of federal bankruptcy laws, the company announced Monday.
   The plan, which also has been confirmed by U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, is expected to be consummated in early December, subject to
closing of the sales of the company's air filter and pump
businesses, Allis-Chalmers said.
   The plan is based on distribution of proceeds from sales of
major businesses of Allis-Chalmers, which began as a farm machinery
producer and branched out into a wide variety of manufactured
goods, and on issuance of new common stock in the reorganized
company.
   Allis-Chalmers in June announced an agreement to sell its pump
business to International Telephone and Telegraph Corp. for $71
million, and in April said it would sell its air quality control
business for $245 million to Snyder General Corp. of Texas.
   An Allis-Chalmers news release stated that between $400 million
and $425 million of proceeds should be available for distribution,
and unsecured creditors would recover about 17 percent to 22
percent of their claims.
   The company also said holders of Series C preferred stock would
receive between $2.4 million and $3 million in cash distributions,
depending on the level of proceeds, and 12 percent of common stock
of the reorganized Allis-Chalmers.
   It said existing common shareholders would receive no cash
distributions and about 19 percent of the common stock in the
reorganized company.
   The reorganization plan also provides for ``continuing lifetime
health care benefits and death benefit coverage for retired
employees at reduced levels secured by trust funds,'' the company
said. Another provision will fund existing pension liabilities and
applicable administrative costs.
   The reorganized Allis-Chalmers will have an office in the
Milwaukee suburb of West Allis and three wholly-owned operating
subsidiaries, one a machinery repair facility in Houston and the
other two involving alternative fuel technologies, the company said.
   Allis-Chalmers and its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for
Chapter 11 reorganization in June 1987 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the southern district of New York.

<HEAD>HCC Rejects Ramada Restructuring Plan; Chain Posts 3rd Qtr. Profit
Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   HCC Corp., a holding company for the Pritzker family of Chicago,
reiterated its desire Monday to take over Ramada Inc. in a $378
million offer and said it was unimpressed by a Ramada restructuring
plan.
   But the chairman of Phoenix-based Ramada responded that his
company would continue to try to carry out the restructuring, which
would include selling off its hotel and restaurant businesses and
the distribution of at least $278 million to shareholders.
   Separately, Phoenix-based Ramada reported that its third quarter
net income declined by 9.5 percent from the same period last year,
due to losses in its hotel and restaurant businesses.
   Ramada posted net income of $3.9 million, or 10 cents per share,
compared with $4.3 million, or 11 cents a share, for the third
quarter of 1987. Revenue during the quarter rose to $141.2 million
from $113.5 million in the year-earlier period.
   The Pritzker family, which also owns Hyatt hotels and is
Ramada's largest shareholder with 7.2 percent of its stock, made
its $10 a share cash buyout offer in September.
   Ramada's board of directors countered Oct. 20 with the
restructuring plan.
   ``Not only was HCC not impressed by the Company's (Ramada's)
restructuring plan...but also the public's reaction...has been
unfavorable as evidenced by the market price per share of common
stock,'' said HCC in a document filed Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C.
   Ramada shares closed up 50 cents at $9.37{ a share Monday on the
New York Stock exchange.
   In a Friday-dated letter sent to Ramada, detailed in the SEC
filing under the name of HCC Vice President Harold S. Handelsman,
HCC told Ramada the restructuring plan did not give stockholders
free rein to decide the company's future. It also called ``clearly
unjustified'' any statement that the buyout proposal was inadequate.
   The HCC letter said its proposal would expire at 5 p.m., CST,
Wednesday.
   ``Should the Company (Ramada) fail to commence a dialogue with
HCC by the time indicated, or should market or other conditions
warrant, HCC will feel free to take such action as it deems
appropriate under the circumstances,'' the letter stated.
   But Ramada Chairman Richard Snell sent a letter Monday to Jay
Pritzker, HCC board chairman, reiterating Ramada's desire to pursue
the restructuring program. Snell said it was ``in the best
interests of all Ramada stockholders.''
   He also said Ramada would keep its gaming holdings under the
plan, and said information about units to be sold would soon go out
to stockholders.
   Ramada owns Marie Callender's restaurants, and under its
restructuring plan, it would retain gambling businesses including
TropWorld in Atlantic City, N.J., and Tropicana in Las Vegas.
   In its earnings report, Ramada said the quarterly profit was
hurt by $4.3 million in net losses from its hotel and restaurant
businesses. Those losses in discontinued operations compare with
1987 third quarter losses of $2.9 million in the same areas.
   For the first nine months of this year, Ramada earned $4.4
million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $6.9 million, or 18
cents a share, through September of last year.
   Nine-month revenue rose to $352.9 million from $315.8 million a
year earlier.

Suit</HEAD>

   Lubrizol Corp. will receive an $80
million cash payment and $6 million in trade credits as part of the
settlement of a patent infringement suit against an Exxon Corp.
subsidiary, the firms said Monday.
   The settlement was reached between Lubrizol, which makes
petroleum additives, and Exxon Chemical Co. of Darien, Conn.,
according to a joint statment by the two companies.
   Under the terms of the consent order, Exxon agreed not to market
over 300 products that allegedly violated Lubrizol's patents and
not to market in the future any products covered by two unexpired
Lubrizol patents.
   Under the agreement, Exxon Chemical received a limited paid-up
license for a replacement product it developed after a June court
order barring it from selling the disputed lubricant additives.
   The consent order ended the suit filed in Cleveland but did not
affect other pending actions regarding the patents in other
countries.

<HEAD>Andersen Sues Saatchi & Saatchi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Accounting giant Arthur Andersen & Co. said
Monday it filed suit against Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, accusing the
huge London-based advertising concern of trying to force Andersen
to sell at least part of its consulting business.
   The suit follows the departure last month of four top consulting
partners of Andersen for a new consulting venture backed by Saatchi.
   Saatchi, the world's largest advertising holding company, is
becoming more deeply involved in a number of non-advertising
businesses.
   The suit appears to resemble a number of other actions in recent
months by advertising and law firms against former executives who
strike out on their own in the same line of work with backing from
their former company's competitors.
   In the suit filed in the Supreme Court of the state of New York,
Chicago-based Andersen accuses the British firm and several former
Andersen executives of conspiring to coerce Andersen to sell all or
part of its management information consulting practice.
   It accused the defendants of raiding Andersen personnel,
interfering with Andersen clients and misappropriating Andersen's
confidential and proprietary technology and trade secrets.
   Named in the suit with Saatchi are the Information Consulting
Group Inc., formed in mid-October with Saatchi financial backing;
Victor E. Millar, a former top executive at Andersen until his
resignation in November 1986, and Gresham T. Brebach, who headed
Andersen's U.S. management consulting practice until he was
relieved of his post last May.
   The suit accuses the individuals with breaching their duty of
loyalty and their fiduciary duties to Andersen and its partners.
   A call was placed to Saatchi headquarters after business hours,
but a spokesman for the company was said to have left for the day.
   In addition to Brebach, the suit names former Andersen
executives C. Thomson Ross, Edward J. Sanderson Jr., Edward F.
Lukes and Charles D. Petersen and accuses them of breaching
fiduciary duties. Those four quit Andersen on Oct. 14 to join
Information Consulting.
   The complaint said Maurice Saatchi, head of Saatchi & Saatchi,
proposed to buy Andersen's management information consulting
practice in January 1985 but that the proposal was rejected.
   It said Millar, while still employed by Andersen, subsequently
approached management with a plan to sell or spin off its
management consulting practice, and his overture was rejected.
   Millar left Andersen in 1986 to join Saatchi, and made
additional overtures in 1987 about the Andersen management
consulting practice, but was told Andersen had no plans to sell it,
the statement said.
   Andersen said it removed Brebach as head of its U.S. management
consulting practice in May 1988 after hearing that he had solicited
other Andersen partners in developing a business plan for an
independent practice.
   The firm said Millar and Brebach encouraged other Andersen
executives to leave and join Information Consulting.

<HEAD>Morrell Seeks Injunction Against Record OSHA Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Morrell & Co. on Monday sought a
federal court injunction to block a record $4.33 million fine
levied against the meatpacker on Friday by the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration.
   Morrell, a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based United Brands Co.,
wants to stop the OSHA action because the company believes it was
unfairly singled out, said Morrell Chairman Milton J. Schloss.
   ``If OSHA continues to single out Morrell and create a
completely uneven playing field against our competition, OSHA could
very well shut that plant down,'' he said.
   OSHA contends the company knew about serious health hazards at
its Sioux Falls plant but failed to protect its workers.
   The action filed in U.S. District Court, seeking an injunction
against OSHA and the U.S. Department of Labor, contends there are
no industry standards on how to prevent the repetitive motion
injuries cited by OSHA, and says Morrell's repeated requests for
establishment of such standards have been ignored.
   The injuries cited by OSHA occur as a result of repreated hand,
wrist and arm motion during work.
   The fine handed down Friday was the largest against a single
employer in OSHA's 17-year history. Morrell had 15 days to appeal
the charges to teh separate federal Occupational Safety and Health
Review Commission.
   Schloss also questioned the timing of the fine, which comes just
weeks before the Nov. 20 expiration date of the current three-year
contract for workers at the Sioux Falls plant. Negotiations are
continuing on a new contract.
   The Sioux Falls plant employs about 2,000 workers. About 240 of
them are union members who crossed the picket line during a
sympathy strike last year. Another 410 are union members called
back to work since the strike ended, and about 1,350 are
replacement workers hired after the strike began.

<HEAD>Insurance Companies Will Pay $61 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four insurance companies have agreed to pay $55
million to federal bank regulators to settle a lawsuit stemming
from the near-failure of Continental Illinois National Bank in
1984, a government attorney said Monday.
   A fifth insurance company also is expected to agree to pay $6
million, increasing the settlement to $61 million, according to
Candace Fabri, an attorney for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The agreement settles a lawsuit originally filed by Continental
shareholders against the supervisors of John Lytle, former bank
vice president. The suit claimed Lytle's superiors were negligent
in failing to prevent him from buying risky loans from Penn Square
Bank in Oklahoma City, Okla.
   The insurance companies had policies covering various
Continental executives and therefore were liable, Ms. Fabri said.
Former bank Chairman Roger Anderson and former President Donald
Miller were among those named in the lawsuit.
   Lytle was accused of making risky loan deals that cost the bank
millions of dollars and contributed to the FDIC's decision to
rescue Continental Illinois with a $4.5 billion bailout in 1984.
   Last summer, Lytle pleaded guilty to misapplication of bank
funds and was sentenced to 3{ years in federal prison. He was
accused by government prosecutors of accepting kickbacks disguised
as personal, low-interest loans in exchange for arranging to have
Continental take risky loans off Penn Square's hands.
   William Patterson, former Penn Square vice president, pleaded
guilty to aiding and abetting Lytle and was sentenced to 2 years.
   When the FDIC became the owner of 80 percent of the bank's stock
as part of the rescue, it inherited the shareholder suit, said Ms.
Fabri.
   Under the settlement, National Union Insurance will pay $28
million; Harbor Insurance Co. will pay $15 million; Allstate
Insurance Co. will pay $9 million; and First State Insurance will
pay $3 million, Ms. Fabri said.
   A fifth company, CNA Insurance, was expected to agree to the
settlement and pay $6 million, she said.
   As part of the settlement, nearly $14 million will be given to
people who held Continental stock from Sept. 1, 1981 through July
5, 1982.
