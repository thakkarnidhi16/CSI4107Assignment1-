<TEXT>
   West Germany suspended military
air shows Monday following the fiery crash at an aviation
exhibition that killed 46 people. Scores of others who suffered
critical burns battled for their lives.
   Sunday's tragedy at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein was
described as the worst air show crash involving spectators. Some
were burned beyond recognition when three Italian jets collided on
a low-level stunt flight and one of them hurtled into the crowd in
a ball of flame.
   People ran in panic, many with clothes in tatters and large
burns on their bodies.
   Most of the more than 300,000 spectators at the annual air show
were West Germans and Americans, and about 500 were injured. The
identities of the dead were not released, but at least 11 Americans
were critically burned.
   ``Some were missing skin on their arms. The sun had come out,
and there were a lot of people who didn't have their shirts on. A
lot had black burns, like their skin was burned black,'' said
DeeDee Arrington Doke, a reporter for the unofficial U.S. military
newspaper Stars and Stripes, who was at the scene.
   John Flanagan, an Air Force sergeant, told Stars and Stripes:
``I saw this little boy just standing there. His hair was all
singed and the skin was coming off his face. And he was just
standing there, looking up at me.
   ``Nobody stopped to help him. They were running. We stopped the
police and the police picked him up.''
   The disaster occurred as an Italian air force flying team in 10
jets, two groups of five each, performed a complicated maneuver
less than 200 feet off the ground shortly before 4 p.m.
   Jim Beichler, a University of Maryland teacher, told the paper
someone next to him had looked at one of the the Italian planes and
said, ``He's going to hit. He's not going to make it.''
   ``The plane blew up, and people started running,'' Beichler
said. ``One guy was on fire. Other people were wrapped up in barbed
wire. There were small fires all around me.''
   A ball of flame 200 feet high and equally wide raced toward the
crowd after the crash that killed the three Italian pilots.
   Sgt. Eddie Lee, a spokesman for Ramstein, said officials were
having trouble identifying the dead and a list of victims would not
be released until Tuesday.
   ``Eleven Americans are in critical condition at a U.S. military
hospital in Landstuhl,'' Lee said, adding that there could be more
such cases in other hospital.
   The ARD television network said the 345 people reported
seriously injured included about 50 critically burned, and Suedwest
Radio said: ``Many of those in critical condition are in danger of
dying.''
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is vacationing,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``We are deeply
saddened by the tragic accident.'' He said the president was
sending messages of condolence to the victims' families.
   Investigators still were trying to determine what caused the
tragedy, which involved three plans in the highlight performance of
the Ramstein air show.
   Two jets rammed each other from opposite directions and the
third Italian MB339-A plowed into a row of cars and buses.
   Dr. William Flannery, a U.S. military doctor supervising
treatment, said ``the hardest part'' was calming relatives of the
many children killed or injured. He spoke at a news conference at
the Army hospital in Landstuhl near Ramstein.
   Quoting American officials, the U.S. military's AFN radio
network said ``Forty-six people were killed, about 500 people were
injured.''
   Rudolf Tartter, head of the local government district that
includes Ramstein, said West German officials put the death count
at 45, one below the U.S. toll. There was no explanation for the
discrepancy.
   ``Of those injured, 345 are seriously injured,'' Tartter said.
   Gen. William L. Kirk, head of the U.S. Air Force in Europe,
issued a statement saying: ``We in U.S. Air Forces in Europe
express our grief over the tragic incident at Ramstein Air Base,
Germany,''
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz said officials will study ways
for West Germany and its NATO allies to demonstrate their air
forces' abilities without endangering spectators.
   ``Until suggestions for effective measures are complete, there
will not be any more air shows with military aircraft in West
Germany, this with the agreement of the air forces of our NATO
allies,'' Scholz announced.
   He also said West German military aircraft would not participate
in stunt-flying performances and canceled an air show scheduled for
Sept. 25.
   On a special program of the ZDF television network Monday night,
Scholz said his order on stunt-flying demonstrations at air shows
would affect only the West German military.
   ``I have made the decision that aerobatic flying can no longer
be considered,'' Scholz said. ``But it is obvious that I can make
this decision only for the West German armed forces.''
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt, speaking on the same program,
indicated the United States might adopt its own ban on stunt-flying
exhibitions at air shows at its bases in West Germany.
   ``We are very open minded about whether there will be future
aerobatic shows,'' Burt said. ``The United States will do all it
can to make sure such a tragedy never happens again.''
   In Brussels, a NATO spokesman said privately the Western
alliance ``as a body does not organize such air shows. The
organization of air shows and participation in them is a matter for
discussion between host nations or air forces and those invited to
take part.''
   Alfred Mechtersmeier, a leader of the environmentalist Greens
Party, demanded the ouster of Scholz following the accident. ``He
bears the primary responsibility for the Ramstein catastrophe,''
said Mechtersmeier, whose party also is known for its staunch
anti-NATO stance.
   A dozen protesters had held up banners outside the Ramstein
gates Sunday as the spectators poured in to watch the stunt flights
at Europe's largest military airport.
   Italy's Defense Ministry said the Frecce Tricolori (Tri-Color
Arrows) aerobatic team would continue performing but would limit
its activities to fly-overs.

   Superman may leap tall buildings but John
Wooten, who bills himself the world's strongest man, moves them.
   Wooten, 40, pulled a 14-ton mobile home atop a flatbed truck
about 100 yards across the Rhode Island-Massachusetts border.
   Monday's feat took about a minute.
   When it was done, a red-faced Wooten said: ``It was a little
easier than I thought. I think I could have almost gone for two
houses.''
   Wooten, 6-foot-1 and 274 pounds, said he considers himself to be
one of the last old-time strong men, the type who ``uses
entertainment to show his strength.''
   Although always unusually strong, it wasn't until Wooten lost
part of a lung to cancer in 1973 that he decided to go for the
glory.
   In 1980, Wooten said, he held two turboprop, 750-horsepower jets
from taking off for almost three minutes at the Worcester airport.
Later that day, he lifted 17 members of the Harvard Marching Band,
he said.
   ``Everything I do is bizzare and wild,'' he said.
   Wooten considers himself to be in the ``prime of my life,'' and
says he's good for 20 more years.

<HEAD>Solomon's Temple Treasure Returned To Israel</HEAD>

   An ivory pomegranate, believed to be the only
existing relic of Solomon's Temple, has gone on display at the
Israel Museum after officials paid $550,000 into a secret Swiss
bank account.
   The thumb-sized object, which measures 1.68 inches by .83
inches, has a hole in the bottom and may have been used as the top
of a scepter carried by a temple priest.
   ``We have never had anything that was in Solomon's Temple.
Minuscule as it is, this is an exquisite treasure,'' said Meir
Meyer, vice chairman of the museum.
   A museum official who demanded anonymity said the money was paid
to the secret account of an anonymous owner in Zurich, Switzerland,
after the museum raised the money from an anonymous donor in Basel.
   The cream-colored relic, which dates to the 8th century B.C. and
is badly chipped on one side, was returned to Israel last week
after it was apparently smuggled out of the country after 1979.
   It is the only exhibit in a long narrow room, displayed in a
case with a dim light to prevent damage to the ivory.
   An armed guard stood nearby as workers rushed to finalize
details of the exhibit before the object was placed on display
Monday.
   Officials said they were reluctant to spend so much money to
return the pomegranate but agreed to do so after two months of
negotiations because it was a national treasure.
   ``The question is whether to bring it back or leave it. Of
course, any object that has such high historical and cultural value
should be brought back,'' said Nahman Avigad, a Hebrew University
archaeologist who authenticated the pomegranate.
   Avigad said ``in all probability'' it was used in the ancient
temple, which was looted and destroyed by the Bablylonians in 589
B.C.
   Thus the pomegranate is likely part of the great treasure of
gold, ivory and precious objects that King Solomon invested in the
temple, which was built about 960 B.C. and housed the Ark of the
Covenant, two stone tablets containing the law of Moses.
   The temple was rebuilt in the 6th century B.C. and expanded by
Herod before being destroyed in A.D. 70. Today, the Dome of the
Rock _ a Moslem shrine that is part of the Al Aqsa complex _ is
located near the site of ancient temple, according to Israeli
scholars.
   Written on the pomegranate in ancient Hebrew is an inscription
that says ``Belonging to the Temple of the Lord (Yahweh), holy to
the priests.''
   Meyer said it was the oldest Hebrew inscription using the name
of God, predating by at least 100 years two silver scrolls with
biblical inscriptions found in Jerusalem a decade ago.
   Meyer said he had been tracking the pomegranate since hearing
about it in 1985. He said a tour guide walked into his office in
1987 and put him in touch with a lawyer for the anonymous owner.
   The pomegranate first came to light in 1979 when Andre Lemaire,
a French expert on ancient inscriptions, stumbled on the relic in
the shop of a Jerusalem antiquities dealer.
   Lemaire of Paris wrote in a 1984 article for the Biblical
Archaeology Review that the dealer only showed him the pomegranate
so he could photograph it.
   Lemaire said the dealer did not know where the pomegranate was
found. But Lemaire speculated it may have been unearthed in the
limestone caves surrounding Jerusalem, which were often used for
tombs.
   The pomegranate next turned up in an exhibition in Paris in 1985
and then disappeared again.
   Israeli laws ban excavation or the export of antiquities without
a permit from the education ministry's Department of Antiquities.
Officials are currently drafting proposed legislation to tighten
controls and virtually outlaw antiquities trading.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest fires have
engulfed nearly one-quarter of the nation's oldest national park,
but only three small buildings have been lost and even with the
blackened forests and thick smoke, Yellowstone hasn't lost its
majesty.
   The series of ferocious fires have so far spared the major
tourist attractions at the grand 116-year-old matriach of the
parks, although one fire still causes concern for the safety of the
facilities around Old Faithful geyser.
   Scorched tree trunks punctuate some camping and picnic areas and
some hiking trails have been lost, along with a comfort station,
outhouse and historic cabin.
   A total of more than 450,000 of the park's 2.2 million acres
have been swept by the worst fires in the area in at least 200
years.
   But flames so far have been successfully diverted around
buildings and monuments. Power lines and some cabins have been
saved under the protection of fire-proof blankets.
   And already officials are planning the rebuilding and talking to
potential visitors about next year _ when grassy meadows will
sprout where dense forest used to be.
   ``Yellowstone will be a different kind of Yellowstone in the
future. It certainly will be a living testament to the most
powerful forces in nature,'' said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   ``On a scale of one to 10, I guess I'd say the condition of the
park is an eight. But we still have at least four more weeks of
drought conditions,'' and the fires continue to spread, she said.
   Yellowstone, which is the size of Delaware and Rhode Island
combined and is visited by more than 2 million people a year, still
has more than one million acres of untouched lodgepole pine.
   Wildlife like buffalo, elk and bears have escaped unharmed, and
still could be seen grazing along some roads Monday. Park rangers
estimate that in areas where fast-moving flames jumped around, only
50 percent of the vegetation was lost.
   ``The park isn't entirely black,'' spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt
said.
   Yet several roads remain closed because of the danger of falling
trees. In some areas, the thick, pungent smoke painted a white
sheet over colorful mountain vistas.
   And about half of the camp grounds and hotels have been shut
down _ not because of damage but because of proximity to danger and
lack of tourists.
   Eight major fires continued burning Monday in Yellowstone, and
several others blazed in national forests on the perimeter.
   While it will take decades of mature trees to return to damaged
areas, fires spark a rebirth in the forest and are actually
beneficial for its ecological cycle by allowing new growth.
   And it is that rebirth that park service officials hope will
draw tourists back to Yellowstone next year.
   ``We'll be very aggressive in communicating with people that
Yellowstone is still here and still has an awful lot for visitors
to see and do,'' Ms. Vanderbilt said.

   Dozens of people, including a duty official at
the state-run Meteorological Service, have reported spotting a UFO
in Israel's skies.
   ``I see a source of light over Tel Aviv,'' Eliezer Danziger, the
duty meteorologist, told Israel army radio on Sunday.
   ``The object changes its brightness from time to time but stays
in one place. It's definitely not a airplane, just a source of
light which doesn't move. Maybe it's a helicopter.'' .
   The army radio said dozens of residents of Tel Aviv and its
suburbs called the station to report that they saw the unidentified
flying object, or UFO.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Mexican charged with the torture-murder of a
U.S. drug agent won a legal victory in a separate drug case Monday
when a federal appeals court ruled searches by U.S. police in
foreign countries are subject to constitutional limits.
   ``The Constitution imposes substantive constraints on the
federal government, even when it operates abroad,'' said the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling.
   The court said a January 1986 search of Rene Verdugo Urquidez's
home in Mexicali, Mexico, by U.S. drug agents and Mexican police
violated the U.S. constitutional ban on unreasonable searches
because agents had no warrant and were not acting in an emergency.
As a result, an alleged drug tally sheet seized can't be used as
evidence in a U.S. trial against Verdugo on drug charges, the court
said.
   Dissenting Judge J. Clifford Wallace said constitutional
standards do not apply to searches of aliens abroad. ``The American
flag simply does not follow nonresident aliens beyond our
territorial limits,'' he said.
   At the time of the search, Verdugo was in a U.S. jail awaiting
trial along with two other men in the February 1985 murder of U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena. U.S.
officials say Camarena was kidnapped outside the U.S. consulate in
Guadalajara, Mexico, and taken to the home of Mexican drug lord
Rafael Caro Quintero, where he was tortured and killed.
   Verdugo, 36, and the other two men are being tried for the
murder in Los Angeles federal court. Four other defendants,
including Caro Quintero, are in jail in Mexico.
   The drug case, charging a conspiracy to import marijuana, is in
pretrial proceedings in federal court in San Diego. Verdugo's
lawyer, Michael Pancer, said Monday the evidence seized in the
search was ``relatively insignificant'' but the legal principle was
important.
   ``For years our agents have been running around in foreign
countries acting in total disregard of the United States
Constitution and commonly accepted standards of morality by
adopting the standards of the country they were in,'' he said.
   ``This decision will go a long way toward restoring a sense of
law and order to the manner in which our agents conduct themselves
in foreign countries.''
   Although U.S. officers should be able to comply with a search
warrant requirement, ``the problem is that we are not in control of
the search beyond that,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Haines
said. ``There's no reason why the foreign officials should be
interested in complying with American law.''
   The court said the search took place a day after Verdugo was
arrested by Mexican police in Baja California and delivered to U.S.
agents in California.
   A DEA agent ordered the search by four agents, accompanied by a
team of Mexican Federal Judicial Police, whose participation was
approved by their commander, the court said. No warrant was sought
in advance from a U.S. magistrate. The search was directed by the
DEA officers, who took charge of the evidence, the court said.
   ``It is clear that the DEA controlled the operation,'' said the
opinion by Judge David Thompson.
   Upholding a ruling by U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving,
Thompson said the search was subject to Fourth Amendment
constitutional standards because it was directed by U.S. officers
for a trial in the United States.

<HEAD>Article: Forefathers Sired More than Their Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's founding fathers sired more than
their country, according to a historian who says sex was a mainstay
of courtship in the Revolutionary War era and often resulted in
premarital pregnancy.
   Judging from birth and marriage records, Americans in the late
1700s ``were more licentious than we imagine them to be,'' Jack
Larkin writes in American Heritage magazine's September-October
issue.
   Larkin cites records of several dozen communities to prove that
in the late 18th century, pregnancy was frequently a prelude to
marriage.
   The proportion of women pregnant at their weddings had been
rising since the late 1600s, and peaked in the decades during and
after the Revolution. In rural New England towns like Sturbridge,
Mass., nearly a third of brides already were with child.
   ``People today tend to assume we've reached the ultimate level
of moral looseness, and that you can look back through our history
at a steadily rising level of immorality, building up to the
present,'' Larkin said in an interview. ``But in fact these things
have gone in cycles.''
   The concept of randy revolutionaries is particularly surprising
in straitlaced New England, considering ``the popular notion of
what Puritanism was all about,'' he said.
   Seventeenth-century New England was indeed a strict society, but
sexual freedom began to increase as the region became more socially
and economically diverse. And, as resistance to British rule spread
through the colonies in the late 1700s, ``all hell broke loose,''
he said.
   But Salem was no Sodom, and Gloucester wasn't a Gomorrah.
``Pregnancies usually simply accelerated a marriage that would have
taken place in any case,'' Larkin writes. ``Most rural communities
simply accepted the `early pregnancies' that marked so many
marriages.''
   Larkin is chief historian at Old Sturbridge Village, a
recreation of an 18th century village, and author of ``The
Reshaping of Everyday Life in the United States, 1790-1840,'' to be
published this fall by Harper & Row.
   When early American communities did censure premarital
pregnancy, it often was more a matter of economics than morals. The
rule, as enunciated by Asa Lincoln, justice of the peace in
Brimfield, Mass., was: ``born a bastard and chargeable to the
town.''
   Accordingly, if a woman were still unmarried when she gave
birth, officials might interrogate her during labor about the
father's identity, not as much to condemn him as to get him to
support his child.
   Sexual mores began to change in the 1820s, Larkin says, as the
turbulent war years receded and society became more settled and
strict.
   Community records in this period show that the proportion of
women who conceived a child before marriage steadily declined. By
1840, the premarital pregnancy rate in New England towns dropped
from nearly one pregnant bride in three to one in five or six. In
some places, prenuptial pregnancy dropped to 5 percent.
   ``For many Americans this marked the acceptance of new limits on
sexual behavior, imposed not by their parents or other authorities
but by themselves,'' Larkin writes.
   ``(They) were marrying later than their parents, often living
through long engagements while the husband-to-be strove to
establish his place in the world. They chose not to risk a
pregnancy that would precipitate them into an early marriage.''
   Such points, Larkin said, are hard to make at a family place
like Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Mass.
   ``That's why I wrote the book,'' he explained. ``Some things are
hard to show in a museum.''

<HEAD>Residents Say Air Tragedy Was Disaster Waiting To Happen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the people of this town near
the biggest U.S. air base in Europe, Sunday's stunt crash was a
disaster waiting to happen _ and made worse because it was ``just
taking risks for a show, not a war.''
   ``We have an air show every day here,'' Stephanie Antes, 26,
said of the warplanes that roar over Ramstein daily from the base.
``But this has to be the last time they it do it for a display.''
   More than 24 hours after the tragedy in which three Italian
stunt aircraft collided, killing more than 40 people and injuring
hundreds as one plowed into the crowd in a ball of flames, Ramstein
has gone quiet.
   Few people were on the streets Monday evening, the bars were
half-empty, and the talk was loaded with resentment.
   There was also a strong sense of just being lucky.
   Heike Griebhammer, a 20-year-old bar attendant, left the air
show just 10 minutes before the crash. Her aunt and a 3-year-old
cousin, Sarah Griebhammer, stayed on.
   The child was caught on the edge of the ball of flame, but she
too was among the lucky ones _ her mother scooped her up and the
child escaped with a badly singed arm, said Miss Griebhammer.
   ``I've always thought something would happen,'' she said. ``It's
only afterward that you wonder why you went (to the show) at all.''
   This town of 8,000 relies heavily on revenues from the sprawling
air base about half a mile from Ramstein's modest business district.
   One establishment, the Diebglocker bar, does a brisk business
from Ramstein air shows.
   But on Sunday afternoon, instead of coming in for a drink and a
meal, hundreds of people poured in trying to telephone friends and
relatives after the accident.
   ``It was just terrible,'' said co-owner Helga Pisani. ``It
doesn't matter what it means for the business. We don't want
another show here.''
   But her husband, Salvatore Pisani, an Italian who settled in
Ramstein 25 years ago, said the shows should go on.
   ``It was just chance, it was fate,'' said Pisani.
   France Hausladen, 74, recalled 25 years of hearing the jets roar
overhead since he moved to Ramstein.
   ``They do it thousands of times and it's all right. But sooner
or later there was going to be a disaster,'' said Hausladen.
   ``People, thousands of people, want to see these things and
nobody makes them go. But it is all so unnecessary.''
   Some residents were cynical over the question whether people
would lose their enthusiasm for the popular shows.
   ``There's a big fuss now, but in six weeks it will probably be
forgotten,'' said Uwe Prien, a 28-year-old sign painter who learned
of the disaster while driving home from a vacation.
   ``I almost didn't want to get here. I just thought, what if it's
my family,'' said Prien. ``My brother was at the show, but he was
all right. He was lucky.''
   Despite the shock and horror left by the tragedy, few people
seemed to have let it affect the good feelings they have about the
Americans living next door.
   ``We don't resent the Americans. They've been here for such a
long time. They're really part of us,'' said Miss Antes. ``This is
as bad for them as it is for us.''
   ``But yesterday, they were just taking risks for a show, not a
war,'' she said.

   Shanghai residents wanting a new aluminum pot

   The price of aluminum in China has more than doubled since

   Only newly married couples who produce their marriage
certificates will be exempt from the old-for-new rationing system,
the newspaper said, and those couples will be limited to two sauce
pans and one tea pot.
   It said the rationing would counter the rising price of aluminum
caused by a shortage of supplies and ``the meddling of profiteers.''
   Aluminum is selling for the equivalent of $4,324 per ton,
compared to $1,892 in January.
   The China Daily said Shanghai speculators have been illegally
buying price-controlled aluminum cookware and then selling the
utensils outside the city for large profits.

<DATELINE>BASRA, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cease-fire between Iran and Iraq is less
than two weeks old, but the battered city of Basra already is
showing signs of recovery.
   Over the weekend, men and boys in white galabia robes sat atop
sandbags lining the Shatt-al-Arab waterway and cast lines baited
with sesame paste into the murky green waters clogged with sunken
freighters.
   Not far away, young swimmers did backflips into the canals that
cut through the city toward the Shatt-al-Arab, which forms the
southern border with Iran. A welder patched a gate at the Sheraton
Hotel, heavily damaged by artillery shells.
   In the city's main square, sandbags fortified the walls of the
Al-Hamdan Hotel and its lobby was covered with jagged shrapnel
holes. But the staff said all the rooms were taken, booked by a
teachers convention and Kuwaitis returning to examine the city
where they once spent vacations.
   Such signs of recovery are noteworthy in a city only 15 miles
from Iran's border, which came under relentless artillery and
missiles fire.
   The attacks on Iraq's only port city during the eight-year war
damaged virtually every building in central Basra, where the
pounding was so intense at times that dozens of shells landed every
minute.
   The city was nearly captured in February 1987 when Iranian
fighters poured across the border and came within six miles of
Basra. In the fierce fighting that followed, the Iranians were
decimated and, according to U.S. defense analysts, suffered 25,000
casualties, including 15,000 dead.
   Hundreds of thousands fled the city of more than 1 million peope
at the height of the shelling and missile attacks from December
1986 to February 1987.
   Basra Governor Anwar Sayid said recently that the shelling
killed 1,000 civilians and wounded 2,000.
   The attacks stopped earlier this year when a series of Iraqi
victories pushed the Iranian guns out of range.
   Iraqis soon began returning to the city, and the population is
now back to about 1 million, Sayid said. Many have begun rebuilding
homes, but reporters touring the city this weekend found a few
areas still nearly deserted.
   Even the pristine Basra airport, reopened hours after the Aug.
20 cease-fire, resembles a massive mausoleum with its granite
floors and marble walls. So far, only one flight a day arrives and
departs.
   The shrapnel-scarred Shatt-al-Arab Hotel was reopened after
eight years to serve as sector headquarter for United Nations truce
observers.
   ``There have been no problems up to now,'' Danish Maj. Jaspar
Boysen said as he sat in the 1930s-era lobby beneath a twirling
ceiling fan. Other observers sank into the worn armchairs nearby,
chatting and working at postcards to escape the heat in their
poorly air-conditioned rooms.
   Sandbags and coils of barbed wire lined the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway outside. By its banks, scores of rusting freighters
trapped eight years ago by the war were anchored two abreast. The
governor said it would probaby take two years to clear the Shatt of
built-up silt and sunken hulks.
   The governor said many people are returning and rebuilding,
carrying truckloads of belongings back to their damaged homes.
Sayid said the government is financing home repairs, rebuilding
schools and hospitals, working on a new water system and planning
to renovate the electrical grid.
   ``I am sure that if you visit it after two months, you could
never imagine the city experienced the war,'' he said.

<HEAD>Second Marriage Comes Late or Never for Many Women, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 738,000 divorced women got married
again last year, but a study suggests that remarriage will come
late or never for many women who recently separated.
   Half the women who separated in the early 1980s will remain
single seven years later, and about 40 percent who were in their
30s when they divorced will never remarry, the study says.
   For those 40 or older, about 70 percent will never return to the
altar, the estimates say. And only 46 percent of black women who
separated during that period are expected to remarry, compared with
76 percent for non-Hispanic white women.
   The estimates imply long periods of single life and possible
economic hardship for some women and their children, said
researchers from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
   ``For many of the children, it's the rest of their childhood
years,'' said co-author Larry Bumpass. ``For many of these women,
it's for the rest of their lives.''
   Bumpass, a sociology professor, developed the projections with
colleagues James Sweet and Teresa Castro. He spoke in a telephone
interview before presenting the study Sunday in Atlanta at the
annual meeting of the American Sociological Association.
   ``It's a very important study, and it's very well done,'' said
Barbara Foley Wilson, a marriage trends researcher at the National
Center for Health Statistics.
   The projections assume that remarriage trends observed during
the early 1980s will continue for 20 years. But remarriage rates
have been declining, so the projections may turn out to
overestimate remarriages, Bumpass said.
   He also said the projections do not differentiate between women
who seek to remarry and those who do not, nor do they count as
remarried women who are simply living with a man.
   The projections were developed from analyzing a 1985 federal
survey that included 2,700 women. The analysis focused on women
because information on marital histories is more accurate for women
than men, Bumpass said.
   The calculations assume that if a woman has not remarried within
20 years of the separation, she will never do so. Studies show only
a relatively tiny proportion marry after that time.
   Overall, 72 percent of women who separated in the early 1980s
will remarry, the projections suggest.
   That includes 89 percent of women who were younger than 25 when
they separated. The percentage drops to 79 percent for ages 25 to
29, 59 percent for ages 30 to 39, and 31 percent for 40 and older.
   The researchers decided that separation would be the best
indicator of when a marriage ended because extraneous factors can
delay divorces.
   Bumpass attributed the trend to a ``shrinking marriage market''
as women age, created by a progressive decrease in supply of
available older men plus a preference by men to marry younger women.
   But Wilson said an age-related decline in remarriage rates also
shows up for men.
   Perhaps marriage becomes less attractive for older people who
have already had a family and whose children provide companionship
they might otherwise seek in a spouse, she said. Older women also
may have to spend energy caring for elderly parents, she said.
   Overall, 81 percent of women who had no children when they
separated were expected to remarry. The rate dips to 73 percent for
women who had one or two children, and 57 percent for those with at
least three.
   One reason is that women with more children tend to be older,
researchers said. But when that was accounted for statistically,
children still reduced the prospect of remarriage in the study, in
agreement with past research.
   ``It's just harder to get out and date,'' Bumpass said. Children
also present a potential mate with added costs and social
responsibility, he said.
   Women who were younger when they first married also tended to
show higher projected rates of remarriage, ranging from 84 percent
for women who were 14 to 17 at their first wedding to 51 percent
for women who were 23 and older.

<HEAD>Nearly 1,700 Buses Damaged In Arab Uprising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,700 Israeli buses have been damaged by
stones and firebombs in the Palestinian uprising, and those that
pass through the West Bank are now being equipped with
shatter-proof windows, officials say.
   Executives of the Egged bus cooperative also said Sunday that if
attacks continue at the current rate, the company will not be able
to maintain service to the West Bank without additional government
funds.
   ``We are almost the only link between the (Jewish) settlements
in the West Bank and Israel,'' Shlomo Levine, secretary general of
Egged, told reporters. ``The service we provide is also a sign of
Israeli presence, no less than the settlers.''
   Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising in lands Israel seized in
the 1967 Middle East war, all Egged drivers have been given pistols
for trips in the occupied West Bank. On especially dangerous
routes, the army provides escorts.
   According to Egged figures, 188 passengers and 24 drivers have
been injured in stoning attacks in the past nine months. In one
case, an Egged driver opened fire on Arab stone-throwers at a
refugee camp outside Jericho, killing one of the youths.
   Most buses of the 1,650 damaged buses were hit by stones, while
39 were torched by firebombs.
   Egged is now avoiding some trouble spots, such as the northern
West Bank city of Tulkarem. The company has also adjusted its
schedule in some cases. For example, buses won't pass certain
dangerous areas after Moslem Friday noon prayers, traditionally a
spark for anti-Israeli demonstrations.
   In another attempt to provide greater security, Egged has
equipped 10 buses with reinforced shatter-proof windows. The
cooperative plans to eventually equip 190 buses with the stronger
windows.
   Egged buses in the West Bank mostly transport Jewish settlers.
In the past, they also carried Arab workers, picking them up in
West Bank villages and taking them to jobs in Israel.
   But two months into the uprising, the army asked Egged not to
enter West Bank villages, saying the vehicles were too easy a
target. Arab buses now take the workers to Israel.
   In a related development, Jewish settlers in the West Bank are
organizing armed escorts for school buses that will transport about
1,500 students when schools reopen in September, Israel's
Transportation Ministry said Sunday.

<TEXT>
   As a shakedown voyage, Sen. Dan Quayle's first
solo campaign trip as the Republican vice presidential nominee was
rougher than most.
   Swamped by questions about his military record and his relations
with a former lobbyist, Quayle began his week in an angry
confrontation with reporters as he took out the garbage at his
Virginia home. He also had to deal with talk that he should do
George Bush a favor and get off the ticket.
   But by Sunday, Quayle was predicting in an interview on his way
home: ``I will eventually be an asset to the ticket.''
   It was a tacit acknowledgement, perhaps, that the jury was still
out.
   Even without the distractions of those questions, Quayle had
trouble getting his message across, and at times seemed to confound
his aides.
   He dispensed with prepared texts, to the point that at an
appearance before hundreds of senior citizens in California, he
neglected even to mention such issues as Social Security or
Medicare, concentrating instead on child care.
   In a discussion on gun control at a Billings, Mont., news
conference, Quayle left the impression that he did not think felons
should be subjected to background checks or other restrictions
before being allowed to buy firearms. His aides had to explain
later that Quayle meant to say that such restrictions should be
left to the states, not the federal government.
   After meeting with farmers at the Missouri State Fair, Quayle
was challenged by reporters to demonstrate that he understood the
technicalities of the farm price support system. His only response
was: ``I know quite a bit about farm policy. I come from Indiana,
which is a farm state.''
   Asked to explain why he voted in previous years against
drought-relief legislation, Quayle could only say that he supported
it this year and added: ``I stand by my record.''
   Then there was his vote against establishing a Cabinet-level
position for the Veterans Administration. Quayle said he voted
against it because he did not believe it would get the veterans
more benefits or services. But as for whether his vote was correct,
Quayle left his questioners guessing by this response: ``Perhaps my
vote was not the right vote. I still think it's the right vote.''
   There were other problems.
   He blamed his staff for an error in his resume overstating the
period in which he was Indiana's chief consumer investigator. His
college performance was admittedly average, but Quayle said he did
not use undue influence to get into law school and would not in any
case make his academic records public.
   If some of his answers lacked depth or details, if they seemed
to suggest that the candidate was unsure, that will change with
time, campaign strategists suggested.
   ``This is my first national campaign. It's much different than
running for the United States Senate,'' Quayle conceded.
   But his demeanor suggested that Quayle was gaining confidence by
week's end. His gestures became broader and he spoke with more
sureness as he fended off unwelcome questions, warmed to his stump
themes and lashed out at Michael Dukakis.
   Youthful and telegenic, he relished photo opportunities that
allowed him to pitch hay, ride a tractor and get licked in the face
by a Labrador retriever _ demonstrating that some things about the
art of politicking never change.
   Quayle insists that more and more, he'll be able to get his
message out.
   ``I am going to continue to talk about the issues that affect
America. Sooner or later the American people will hear what Dan
Quayle feels about the issues. ... Sooner or later they will know
where I stand.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Two Senators on What Bush Knew, When</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senators conclude in a new book that Vice
President George Bush endorsed the sale of weapons to Iran. They
say he did so either out of loyalty to President Reagan or because
he, too, ``was consumed'' with the idea of freeing American
hostages.
   Noting that the issue remains important ``because of Bush's
quest for the presidency,'' Sens. William S. Cohen, R-Maine and
George Mitchell, D-Maine., say the central question is ``exactly
what were his thoughts about the propriety of the covert action
itself, and what steps, if any did he take to satisfy himself about
the potential consequences to the United States if it went
forward.''
   For those questions, they have no answers.
   The two Maine senators were members of the Senate Iran-Contra
Committee which, with its House counterpart, conducted hearings in
the spring and summer of 1987 into the affair.
   Bush has said that although he was generally aware of the secret
sale of arms to Iran he was not involved in the implementation of
the plan.
   The two senators note that Bush has often said he was ``out of
the loop'' on the operation and was not aware that it involved arms
for hostages until he was briefed by Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., then chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on
Dec. 20, 1986, ``almost a month after the affair had become
public.''
   In their book, ``Men of Zeal: A Candid Inside Story of the
Iran-Contra Hearings,'' the two senators recall testimony and
documentary evidence indicating that Bush was present at many
meetings in which the secret arms sales were discussed.
   They quote at length from a July 29, 1986, memo written by
Bush's aide, Craig Fuller, describing a meeting between the vice
president and Amiran Nir, an Israeli government terrorism expert
which essentially described the operation in arms-for-hostages
terms.
   Mitchell and Cohen recount the early appearance of the issue in
the presidential race, noting that former Secretary of State
Alexander M. Haig Jr. and other presidential contenders continually
pressed Bush on the issue.
   Haig, they noted, repeatedly asked this question: ``The American
people are entitled to know what position he (Bush) took during
this storm that imperiled our nation's interests. Was he the
copilot in the cockpit, or was he back in economy class?''
   The two senators say, however, that the nature of the vice
presidency itself may have distanced Bush from the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``Once elected, the president and his top advisers relegate the
vice president to the role of understudy, to be informed of
policies and events rather than actively involved in shaping
them,'' they write.
   ``When the vice president seeks election to the presidency, the
perception of the vice president as working at the president's
right hand is at war with his distance from real decision-making in
the White House.''
   Bush has refused to disclose the substance of his discussions
with the president about the secret arms sales.
   ``It is possible that in those conversations, Bush cautioned the
president against selling weapons to the Iranians,'' they said.
   But they say that whatever doubts may exist about the nature of
Bush's role, Adm. John Poindexter, the former national security
adviser, ``was convinced that the vice president supported the
initiative.''
   They quote from a Poindexter memo on Feb. 1, 1986, stating that
while some top officials still disagreed with the arms-for-hostages
policy, ``President and VP are solid in taking the position that we
have to try.''
   ``Vice President Bush considered himself to be on the periphery
of this major foreign policy decision _ in Haig's terms, more of a
passenger than a copilot,'' Mitchell and Cohen said.
   ``But we think it fair to say that, even if he were a copilot,
his position would have remained the same,'' they said.
   They note that in his heated exchange on the issue with CBS
anchorman Dan Rather last Jan. 25, Bush said: ``I went along with
it _ because you know why, Dan ... when I saw Mr. (William)
Buckley, when I heard about Mr. Buckley being tortured to death,
later admitted as a CIA chief. So if I erred, I erred on the side
of trying to get those hostages out of there.''
   The two senators' conclusion: ``The vice president endorsed the
weapons sale to Iran either out of loyalty to the president or
because he, too, was consumed by the passion to obtain the freedom
of the hostages.''

   ABC's baby boomer shows, the 1980s
ensemble drama ``thirtysomething,'' and the 1960s nostalgia comedy,
``The Wonder Years,'' won as best series Sunday night at the 40th
annual Emmy Awards.
   Tyne Daly won her fourth Emmy as lead actress in the police
drama ``Cagney & Lacey'' and Michael J. Fox of ``Family Ties'' won
his third as lead actor in a comedy series.
   Richard Kiley was picked as best lead actor in a drama for the
canceled but acclaimed series ``A Year in the Life,'' and he
chastised NBC for the ``corporate myopia that killed a fine show.''
   John Larroquette won his fourth straight Emmy as best supporting
actor in the comedy ``Night Court.''
   Beatrice Arthur joined her two ``Golden Girls'' co-stars,
previous winners Rue McClanahan and Betty White, in picking up the
Emmy for best actress in a comedy series. Estelle Getty, who plays
the feisty matriarch on the NBC series, won as best supporting
actress.
   The award for best supporting actress in a drama went to
Patricia Wettig, the struggling young mother with a rocky marriage
on ``thirtysomething.'' The new serio-comic series about people in
their 30s struggling through the 1980s won four Emmys.
   ``The Wonder Years,'' another new show last season, is a grown
man's recollection of coming of age in the 1960s.
   Larry Drake picked up an award for best supporting actor in a
drama series for his sensitive portrayal of a mentally retarded
office boy on ``L.A. Law.''
   His award and an editing Emmy were the only honors won by ``L.A.
Law,'' which led all shows with 19 nominations and was last year's
big winner.
   No one series or network dominated the awards, dominated in
recent years by NBC. ABC won 21, CBS won 20, and NBC won 19. The
Public Broadcasting Service won seven and Home Box Office, in the
first year cable networks were eligible, won three. Syndicated
shows also won three.
   The most Emmys _ five _ were won by a special ``Julie Andrews
... The Sound of Christmas.''
   CBS' ``Irving Berlin's 100th Birthday Celebration'' won the
award for best variety special, beating out NBC's David Letterman,
Fox's Tracey Ullman and the Smothers Brothers on CBS.
   ``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' NBC's fact-based story of a
businessman wrongly convicted and lynched for the murder of a
13-year-old girl won as best miniseries.
   Best lead performances in a miniseries or special went to Jason
Robards in NBC's remake of ``Inherit the Wind,'' and Jessica Tandy
for ``Foxfire: Hallmark Hall of Fame'' on CBS. She played a
backwoods widow coming to terms with the death of her husband,
played by Miss Tandy's real-life husband, Hume Cronyn.
   British actress Jane Seymour's portrayal of Maria Callas on
ABC's ``Onassis: The Richest Man in the World,'' won her an Emmy
for best supporting actress in a miniseries or special. John Shea
won the supporting actor award in that category for his role in
ABC's ``Baby M,'' as William Stern the natural father in the New
Jersey surrogate mother court case.
   Writing awards went to ``thirtysomething,'' CBS' ``Frank's
Place,'' and ``Jackie Mason on Broadway'' on HBO.
   Directing Emmys went to NBC's now-canceled drama ``St.
Elsewhere,'' ABC's comedy ``Hooperman,'' the CBS miniseries ``The
Attic: The Hiding of Anne Frank, General Foods Golden Showcase,''
and the public TV special ``Celebrating Gershwin: Great
Performances.''
   Robin Williams won an Emmy for ``ABC Presents a Royal Gala.''
   ``Now I am officially overwhelmed!'' said Larroquette, who
picked up his fourth-straight award for his portrayal of a
skirt-chasing assistant prosecutor on the NBC comedy spoof of the
legal system. He jokingly thanked the Emmy voters for their
``magnanimous generosity and their keen eye for talent.''
   ``I didn't expect this to happen this time,'' said the newlywed
Fox, who won three years in a row for playing the up-and-coming
yuppie Alex Keaton on ``Family Ties.'' ``I can't be any happier
than to say, `I thank my wife, Tracy.'''
   Ms. Daly, whose co-star Sharon Gless won in the category last
year, was not present to pick up her statuette for her portrayal of
Detective Mary Beth Lacey in the series that almost was canceled in
its first season in 1982 and won't be returning next season.
   Sunday night's show on Fox Broadcasting reunited oldtime
co-stars Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke, and William Shatner
and Leonard Nimoy of ``Star Trek,'' as presenters of the Television
Academy of Arts and Sciences Awards.
   Other presenters during the ceremony at the 3,000-seat Pasadena
Civic Auditorium included Fox, Danny DeVito, Tracey Ullmann, Ms.
Gless, Penny Marshall, Garry Shandling and Alf. There was no single
host this year.
   Executive producer Lorne Michaels, the creator of ``Saturday
Night Live,'' was brought in by the academy in hopes of enlivening
the Emmy show, which most critics considered a four-hour yawn last
year.
   ``This show won't take itself too seriously,'' Michaels said.
   To that end, it featured a ``designated acceptor'' for absent
winners _ actor Tony Danza. He was kept busy throughout the night
as others winners were not present, and after a half-dozen walks to
the stage, he cracked: ``Now I'm mad; where are these people?''
   To add to the merriment, Michaels enlisted ``Saturday Night's''
Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks as the ``Sweeney Sisters.'' They gave
mockish versions of television theme songs and trooped the stellar
audience squealing at the celebrities.

   Last year the Emmy telecast received its lowest rating on
record. That was the first time the Emmys had not been presented on
ABC, CBS or NBC. Fox outbid the big three networks and entered into
a three-year contract.
   For the first time this year, programs broadcast on cable were
eligible, as long as they were available to 50 percent of the
nation's population. Five cable networks managed to collect 21
nominations among them, compared to 114 for NBC, 87 for CBS, 75 for
ABC, and 27 for PBS.
   The Emmy telecast, which normally is scheduled for late
September, was earlier this year to avoid competing with the
Olympic Games, said academy spokesman Murray Weissman.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank customers, beginning this week, will be
guaranteed quicker access to their money under new federal
regulations that are being hailed as a victory for consumers.
   The Expedited Funds Availability Act was passed by Congress in
August 1987 and takes effect Thursday. Under it, banks, savings and
loans and credit unions must give customers access to deposited
funds within one, three or seven days, depending on the type of the
check.
   Consumer groups complained that too many banks were freezing
funds for periods as long as two or three weeks in a practice that
was costing Americans millions of dollars. Banks frequently refer
to the practice as putting a ``hold'' on deposited checks.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group said that banks were
making $290 million annually in interest on the money they were
withholding from customers during the so-called ``float period,''
the time between when the bank got credit for the funds and when it
released the money for use by the depositor.
   Additionally, the consumer research group said banks were
collecting another $145 million a year in bounced-check fees
because funds were not released faster for depositors' use.
   ``Shorter hold periods for checks are especially important to
people on tight budgets or fixed incomes. It will be a relief
because they won't have checks bounce while their funds are tied
up,'' said Leslie Gainer, a lobbyist for the consumer research
group.
   With certain exceptions, the new law requires that local checks
must be cleared by the bank within three business days. A local
check is one written on an institution in the same metropolitan
area or within the same Federal Reserve check processing region.
   Non-local checks must be cleared within seven business days.
   Money deposited in the form of cashiers' checks, certified
checks and government checks must be available to depositors by 9
a.m. on the next business day.
   By Sept. 1, 1990, the maximum hold period will drop to two days
for local checks and five days for non-local checks.
   Bankers struggling to implement the new procedures are grumbling
that the rules may be an invitation to fraud. They say the new law
will not give them enough time to make sure deposited checks don't
bounce or were not forged, especially in the case of the one-day
deadline for certified checks.
   Implementation of the regulations is also proving costly. The
Federal Reserve is planning to spend $30 million over three years
in new procedures and equipment to speed check processing, money
that will be recouped in higher processing fees charged to banks.
   Banks are spending their own money to train their employees and
produce brochures to get word of the changes to customers. That
information must be in customers' hands no later than Oct. 31.
   While some of the expense undoubtedly will be passed on to
customers in the form of higher fees, consumer advocates say a 1986
survey found that 20 percent of banks at the time were complying
with the new guidelines, suggesting that they were able to do so
and still remain competitive in the fees they were charging for
their services.
   The new regulations required a 600-page guide from the Fed,
which dealt not only with the deadlines but such matters as how
checks should be endorsed.
   The endorsement guidelines, which limit endorsements to the
first 1.5 inches on the back of the check, are proving to be a
major headache for retail stores. Many businesses routinely stamp
the backs of checks with a lengthy list of identification items
store clerks must obtain from customers.
   As a consequence, many stores are rushing to buy new rubber
stamps or reprogram cash registers to print within the smaller
endorsement area.
   Fed officials defend the new endorsement requirements, saying
they are needed to speed the check-clearing process so that bounced
checks can be returned quickly to the institution where they were
cashed.
   The goal is to get the check back before the institution
releases the money.

   Vice President George Bush says he's encouraged
but not complacent about his post-convention rise in public opinion
polls.
   ``The polls look good _ I can't say I believe them because I'm
the guy that when they looked bad said I don't believe them,'' Bush
said aboard Air Force Two after a memorial service Sunday for
former Texas Gov. Price Daniel in Austin.
   Bush's standings have improved from a double-digit lag behind
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to a virtual dead
heat in polls since the Republican National Convention two weeks
ago in New Orleans.
   Bush also said he feels good about his first campaign trip to
Texas since he became the Republican presidential nominee.
   ``We've had a good swing,'' he said of the four-day trip to his
adopted home state, which his campaign has targeted as a key
battleground for November. ``I've got to work hard, but it's
doable, very very doable,'' he said.
   Bush was traveling today from Houston to St. Louis, where he
planned a tour of an aerospace plant, and then to Nashville for a
rally and visit to the Reserve Officer Training program at Middle
Tennessee State University.
   He returns to Washington tonight for a series of day campaign
trips to various states and may head west to California and
Colorado on the weekend.
   Asked if he was looking forward to debating Dukakis, he said
only, ``Sure.''
   Dukakis has ben pushing to begin the debates in September,
sooner than the Bush campaign is willing to start. Bush said he was
leaving arrangements to his campaign chairman, James A. Baker III.
Baker is to meet with Dukakis aide Paul Brountas on Tuesday to
discuss the debate schedule.
   Asked about results of opinion polling by his campaign, Bush
said the figures were encouraging.
   However, he expressed caution about poll numbers as he has in
the past.
   ``I think it's very encouraging, the movement in the polls,'' he
said. ``But again those things change so dramatically that we can't
change our campaign game plan or anything based on the polls.
   ``I can't deny that it's encouraging, but there's certainly
nothing in there that makes me relax.''
   His goal, he said, is to continue trying to pin contrast Dukakis
with himself.
   Bush's last day of his Texas was low-key compared with the usual
hectic pace of campaigning.
   He went to an Episcopal church service in Houston, attended an
Astros baseball game, and flew to Austin for the memorial service
for former Gov. Price Daniel, a longtime friend.
   The Bush campaign is trying to play up Bush's credentials as a
Texan in light of competition from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis'
running mate.
   Bush, a Connecticut native, moved to Texas in the 1940s, but has
spent many of his adult years in Washington.
   Talking to reporters aboard Air Force Two, Chief of Staff Craig
Fuller said Bush will continue to stress his pro-military views in
the coming week and paint Democratic rival Michael Dukakis as weak
on defense, a theme the campaign feels is going over well.
   Fuller said Bush would likely return to Texas by mid-September,
and in the meantime send surrogates and family members to work the
state.
   But Bush told reporters he wasn't engaging in any politics on
Sunday.
   The onetime captain of the Yale baseball team showed off his
pitching style, throwing out the first ball in the Astrodome for
the Houston Astros game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

<HEAD>Novelist Max Shulman, Creator of `Dobie Gillis,' Dies at Age 69</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Humorist Max Shulman, who created the
love-seeking 1950s teen-ager Dobie Gillis, was remembered upon his
death as ``a unique comic voice.''
   Shulman, a novelist, screenwriter and playwright, died at age 69
Sunday at his Hollywood home surrounded by his family, said George
Kirgo, West Coast president of the Writers Guild of America.
   Shulman was born in 1919 in St. Paul, Minn., the son of a
Russian-born housepainter. He graduated from the University of
Minnesota in 1942 and quickly produced two successful comic novels:
``Barefoot Boy With Cheek'' in 1943 and ``The Feather Merchants''
in 1944.
   Perhaps his best known creation was the Gillis character, which
became the basis for the motion picture ``The Affairs of Dobie
Gillis'' and the popular TV series ``The Many Loves of Dobie
Gillis,'' which ran on CBS from 1959-1962 and starred Dwayne
Hickman.
   ``He was a unique comic voice in American letters,'' said Kirgo,
who had been working on a screenplay with Shulman. ``He'll be
sorely missed by the writing community and anybody who loved
literature. He was one of a kind.''
   Shulman wrote many successful novels including ``Sleep Till
Noon,'' ``The Zebra Derby,'' ``Rally Round The Flag, Boys,'' ``I
Was a Teenage Dwarf,'' ``Anybody Got A Match'' and ``Potatoes Are
Cheaper.''
   His Broadway credits included ``Barefoot Boy With Cheek'' in
1947; ``The Tender Trap'' in 1954; and ``How Now, Dow Jones'' in
1967.
   Shulman co-wrote with Julius Epstein the screenplay for the 1978
Walter Matthau-Glenda Jackson comedy ``House Calls.''
   Shulman is survived by his wife, Mary, three sons, two daughters
and seven grandchildren.
   A memorial service is scheduled for Sept. 7.

   Striking nurses at six hospitals voted
Sunday to end a four-week walkout by approving a contract that will
raise their pay three times over the next 34 months.
   Seventy-seven percent of 1,200 registered nurses who voted
approved ratifying the agreement, the union said. The California
Nurses Association's 2,200 members have been on strike, mainly over
pay, since Aug. 2, when they joined 1,700 licensed vocational
nurses and hospital service workers who walked off their jobs July
26. They struck mainly over health benefits, and went back to work
Wednesday.
   The new contract would provide raises of 8 percent, 7 percent
and 6 percent over the life of the nurses' contract and grant the
increases a total of four months earlier than in a settlement
rejected by a 2-1 margin on Aug. 19. The rejected 36-month pact
offered increases of 7.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 6 percent.
   Under the contract, a day-shift nurse at top scale will make
$21.99 an hour by the end of the contract, or $45,700 a year.
   Nurses are expected to begin returning to work on Wednesday,
said Maureen Anderson, a CNA spokeswoman.
   Karen Henry, chief negotiator fof the Affiliated Hospitals, the
group representing the affected medical facilities, said Sunday
night that the contract ``accomplished the hospitals' bargaining
objectives.'' She defined that mainly as avoiding large pay raises
in a two-year period.
   ``It's not everything every nurse wants, but I think it's
probably enough to satisfy most nurses,'' said Rebecca Morrow, a
nurse and picket captain at Mount Zion Hospital.
   Karen Sano, a critical-care nurse at Mount Zion, disagreed. She
said ``a lot of nurses were not that pleased'' with the increase or
the contract length. Many nurses expressed concern that the
contract would prevent them from striking with Local 250 of the
Hospital Workers Union if that union decides to strike when its new
contract expires in two years.
   The nurses' negotiating committee unanimously endorsed the
tentative settlement. A week earlier it gave only 5-4 support to
the proposal voted down on Aug. 19.
   The nurses' strike has targeted Children's, Marshal Hale, St.
Mary's, St. Francis and Mount Zion hospitals in San Francisco and
Seton Medical Center in Daly City.

<HEAD>Drought Effect on Fruit, Vegetable Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A review of fruit, vegetables and other
``high-value'' crops watched closely by the Agriculture Department
shows that the 1988 drought has trimmed some harvests but did
little harm to others.
   ``The drought disrupted normal production and marketing of
Midwestern processing vegetables, dry beans, sugar beets and tart
cherries,'' says the department's Economic Research Service.
``Drought damage had less influence on the markets for other
fruits, tobacco, sugar cane, tree nuts and fresh vegetables.''
   Last week the Labor Department reported that grocery prices rose
1.4 percent in July, the sharpest increase in 4{ years. One of the
factors was a 4.7 percent gain for fresh fruits and vegetables.
   USDA economist Glenn Zepp said the biggest drought impact among
fruit and vegetable crops was on processing vegetables grown in
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois, where production
dropped and prices rose.
   Green pea production in Wisconsin and Minnesota, which accounted
for more than half of the U.S. output in 1987, declined 50 percent
this year because of drought-reduced yields.
   Snap bean production under contract with processors is expected
to be down 14 percent from last year.
   ``Production in Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin is forecast
down 20 percent,'' Zepp reports in the September issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``Half the 1987 crop came from these
three states. A hot summer and limited moisture ravaged snap bean
fields in Arkansas, Pennsylvania and New York.''
   Despite rain in late July in some production ares, Midwestern
canners expect the sweet corn pack to be 30 percent to 50 percent
below their planned volume. Similar shortfalls are reported for the
region's canned beets, carrots, lima beans and tomatoes.
   ``Most processing tomatoes (88 percent in 1987) are grown in
California, so drought-reduced output in the Midwest will have
little effect on total tomato supplies or prices,'' he said.
   But Zepp said that by mid-August canners were quoting delivered
prices 25 percent to 35 percent higher for green peas, snap beans
and sweet corn than at the beginning of the summer.
   Looking at fresh vegetables, he said shipments from major U.S.
production areas to consumer centers are slightly ahead of last
year.
   ``Output from California, the major producing state, has not
been affected by the drought because crops are irrigated,'' he
said. ``Fresh output from some drought areas is reportedly down.
Because these areas normally provide only a small portion of total
supplies, however, the effect on fresh vegetable prices has been
minimal.''
   A large harvest of dry edible beans in 1987 drove prices down
for most types, and growers indicated in March they would reduce
plantings 23 percent this year and turn to corn and soybeans. As a
result, prices rose sharply in anticipation of the cutback.
   But the dry bean acreage declined only 13 percent from last
year, and from a historical perspective, the 1988 acreage was up by
about 8 percent from the previous nine-year average.
   In August, the department estimated total dry bean production at
21 million hundredweight, down 20 percent from 1987. In Michigan,
where farmers reduced bean acres by 43 percent, production declined
even more sharply.
   Dry bean production, according to the August forecast, is
expected to be down 50 percent in Michigan, 32 percent in North
Dakota and 55 percent in Minnesota, while rising 14 percent in
Nebraska and 7 percent in Colorado.
   The lower yields ``were due to hot, dry weather which damaged
fields from New York to North Dakota,'' Zepp said.
   Dry bean prices at the farm averaged $27.30 per hundredweight in
July, compared with $19.40 a year earlier.
   Although drought inflicted heavy damage on the tart cherry crop,
which is down 42 percent from last year, it probably will have only
minimal effect on other major fruit crops, Zepp said.
   ``Dry weather has been credited with reducing the size of
peaches in Alabama and North and South Carolina, dropping August
estimates of Southern state peach production 3 percent below June
forecasts,'' he said. ``Nevertheless, total peach production is
forecast 4 percent above last year.''
   The U.S. apple harvest is expected to be down 23 percent from
last year's record production, but still 2 percent more than in
1986.
   ``Late spring freezes in Michigan, winter damage in parts of New
York, and tree stress from last year's record crop in Washington
appear to be the principal culprits,'' Zepp said.
   Drought has hurt sugar beet production this year, with the crop
forecast at 25.7 million tons, down from 27.9 million tons last
season. Reduced yields per acre are to blame, the report said,
particularly in the Red River Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota.
Beet conditions in other growing areas were reported as good to
excellent.
   Sugar cane production, which is concentrated in Florida, Hawaii,
Louisiana and Texas, may increase 4 percent to 31.1 million tons in
1988, since weather has been favorable and yields improved from
last year.
   Flue-cured tobacco production, which is concentrated in the
Southeast, is expected to be up 12 percent from last year, despite
hot, dry weather early in the season. Burley output, with Kentucky
being the leading state, suffered from drought, and crop estimates
put the harvest down by 1 percent.

   Comedian Bill Cosby has said no to a
county request to make up for a $10,000 budget cut by the
administration of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in a program aimed at
preventing teen-age pregnancy.
   Franklin County Commission Chairman William Benson said
frustration and anger at state officials prompted commissioners to
seek the donation from Cosby, who lives in Shelburne Falls.
   ``It's one thing to say that money is tight. It's another thing
to have to approach a local celebrity, hat in hand, just to keep
alive a program that was supposed to be a priority of the
governor,'' Benson said Thursday.
   The $10,000 grant for the program was among $40,000 cut from
county allocations in the state's fiscal 1989 budget following
projected revenue shortfalls.
   In a letter to county commissioners this week, an aide to Cosby
said the comedian would not cover the state aid cut.

   Mayor Sonny Bono says he has been
flying first class for 30 years. Now he wants the city to foot the
bill so his wife and infant son can travel the world with him as he
promotes this desert resort _ first class.
   Bono called a news conference Thursday to explain his reasons
for the request so it doesn't blow up into what he called a
``national incident.''
   Bono, who makes $15,000 a year as mayor, said he has flown first
class since his days as an entertainer and as part of the
husband-and-wife singing duo Sonny and Cher.
   ``I am a family man. I don't want to go away and not see my kid
for 10 days,'' Bono said of his 4-month-old son, Chesare Elan.
``That may sound corny or ridiculous, but I take him everywhere I
go. And I also want to travel with my wife.''
   Some residents have criticized the request, which comes at a
fiscally sensitive time. Palm Springs voters will decide Nov. 8
whether to continue a utility tax to avoid a deficit.
   ``I'm just throwing it out there. If the public doesn't want it
and they say, `No, you can't travel that way,' then so be it,''
Bono said.
   City spokeswoman Julie Baumer said there are no provisions for
city officials to fly first class or for spouses to accompany
officials on trips.

   Dozens of bird watchers and well-wishers flocked
to a downtown club Friday to honor leading ornithologist Roger Tory
Peterson and celebrate his 80th birthday.
   Peterson, who turns 80 Sunday, recalled that it was a
seventh-grade teacher in Jamestown, N.Y., who got him interested in
birds by having his class form a junior Audubon Club.
   Peterson also remembered that his original ``Field Guide to the
Birds'' was turned down by four publishers before Houghton Mifflin
Co. of Boston accepted the manuscript. It has since become one of
the publishing company's biggest sellers. Houghton Mifflin threw
the reception.
   The internationally known author, artist and lecturer published
his first ``Field Guide'' in 1934 and created the pocket-sized book
that became a constant companion of millions of bird fanciers.
   In the decades since, Peterson has written, illustrated or
edited a succession of bird guides, flower guides and other nature
books. He said he plans five more books.
   Among his many honors, Peterson has received a Medal of Freedom.

   Singer-songwriter John Denver says reports
that he would pay the Soviet Union $10 million to take a ride on a
Soviet space ship are erroneous, but he still would like to go.
   ``Let me be clear: I would give my guitar to go into space,''
Denver said Friday. ``I've expressed this to NASA. Unfortunately,
it looks like a civilian in the American space program is now a
long way off. To fly with the Soviets greatly enhances what I
already considered an incredible opportunity.''
   He said the commercial arm of the Soviet space program
approached him about being the first American civilian to go up in
a Soviet spacecraft. Last April, Denver said he traveled to Moscow
to discuss the proposal with Soviet officials and learned ``that it
costs them roughly $10 million to house, train and ultimately put a
human in space for one week.''
   ``In the past, when a non-civilian foreigner has gone up in a
Soviet spacecraft, these costs have been assumed by means of a
government-to-government agreement. Since this venture is
non-governmental, alternative means of financing will have to be
explored. Regardless of what has been implied elsewhere, I have no
intention of paying the Soviets $10 million and I think it would be
highly inappropriate to do so.''

   Designer hats for horses?
   That may be the next fashion trend on New York City streets,
says Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   Koch told the Industrial Designers Society of America on Friday
that he's been looking into ways to comfort the city's carriage
horses during hot, muggy weather.
   City regulations require that the animals be taken back to their
stables when the mercury reaches 90 degrees, but animal lovers say
the horses can experience discomfort in temperatures just below
that. One horse collapsed earlier this month while being taken to
his stable on a 90-degree-plus day.
   ``We've looked into the question of having umbrellas of
different sorts to safeguard the horses and we've discarded that as
unworkable,'' Koch told the designers. ``We've come up with
something that goes back to our roots, I guess _ a straw hat for a
horse.''
   He said there is no official design contest for such a hat, but
``if anyone wants to send me a drawing ... I will select the best
hat and then (Parks Commissioner) Henry Stern will issue
regulations.''

<HEAD>Consultant Says He Is Worried about Going to Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consultant linked to the Pentagon
procurement investigation says he never asked about the sources of
sensitive information he received from other consultants, and
neither did the companies to which he passed it.
   ``Companies never ask you where you get the information,''
Thomas Muldoon said in an interview published Sunday in The
Hartford Courant. ``There was never any doubt what I was being paid
for.''
   Muldoon has been named in court papers in connection with a
federal investigation into whether consultants obtained
confidential or classified information about Pentagon competitions
and sold it to defense industry officials who wanted an edge in
competing for multimillion-dollar contracts.
   Muldoon, who worked for Hartford's United Technologies Corp. and
several other defense contractors, described an informal and
extensive network of consultants, government officials and defense
contractors whose interests in passing information often meshed.
   He insisted that most consultants are aboveboard and do not
intend to break the law in garnering their intelligence. And he
said he did not pay bribes.
   Muldoon has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but he said he
is fearful he might be.
   ``I'm worried I'm going to prison,'' he said. ``And, quite
frankly, I don't understand it.''
   In documents released by a federal court in Dallas, FBI agents
allege that Muldoon, while working for United Technology's Norden
Systems division of Norwalk, was paying another consultant for
information that was in turn being provided by a high-ranking Navy
official.
   The information included rival bids on a contract for a
battlefield communications system, for which Norden was competing,
the documents said.
   Muldoon characterized the government's investigation as an
exercise in discovering the obvious.
   ``This is like that great quote from the Humphrey Bogart movie
`Casablanca' when they close down the joint and the guy says, `I'm
shocked there's gambling going on here,''' Muldoon said.
   ``If there's that many companies involved and that many people,
you know it's a fact of life.''

   Tracey Ullman dubbed it ``the hippest Emmys,''
and, oh, was it. Next year they'll probably just call it, ``So It's
the Emmy Awards _ See If We Care.''
   But this was, in fact, the 40th Annual Emmy Awards, so it was
kind of two-faced, alternately glib and cynical, then mushily
nostalgic over clips of Ozzie and Harriet, Jimmy Durante, Jack
Benny and Rochester, Lucille Ball and Jackie Gleason, among dozens
of others, flickering reminders of the days when we weren't so hip.
   This year's executive producer, Lorne Michaels of ``Saturday
Night Live,'' gamely attempted to salvage the event from tedium and
for the most part succeeded. It was 40 minutes shorter and
infinitely more entertaining than the rambling four hours last year.
   Instead of the embarrassingly bad musical number that has opened
awards shows past, Sunday night's show opened with a musical number
that was bad on purpose _ Jan Hooks and Nora Dunn doing their
wonderfully lame lounge act, the Sweeney Sisters from ``Saturday
Night Live.'' During a bad medley of TV theme songs, they roamed
the audience, gaping at the celebrities who squirmed and simpered
uncomfortably.
   Michaels' thinly veiled homage to his own show _ the band was,
of course, led by SNL's G.E. Smith _ occasionally rivaled even the
Fox Broadcasting Co.'s level of self-promotion. This is the second
year Fox has carried the Emmys.
   In between plugging their Fox shows, co-presenters Ullman and
Garry Shandling discussed the Emmys.
   ``This is the hippest Emmys I've ever seen,'' Ullman said.
   ``Oh, these are the real Emmys. I thought this was just another
`Saturday Night Live' skit,'' replied Shandling, displaying hipness
squared.
   Some winners even got in on the too-hip act. John Larroquette,
who picked up his fourth Emmy for best supporting actor in ``Night
Court,'' noted wearily, ``Now I am officially overwhelmed.'' He
thanked the academy for its ``generosity and keen eye for talent.''
``A little anti-humility joke,'' he over-explained.
   Michaels dispensed with the co-host concept, instead having
co-presenters engage in dialogues that were sometimes _ gasp _
funny. Kirstie Alley (``Cheers'') enthused over co-presenter John
Lithgow's acting ability, especially his Broadway performance in
``M. Butterfly.'' Lithgow replied in perfect halting perplexity,
``This is very embarrassing Kirstie, but ... I'm not exactly sure
what you do.''
   Robin Williams, not even safe on videotape, paid a hilarious,
crazed, tasteless tribute to cable programming. Cable shows were
eligible for Emmys this year for the first time.
   Tony Danza was the ``designated acceptor,'' a new comic device
that allowed him to pick up Emmys for those who were too hip to
even be at the ceremony. When John Shea won for supporting actor in
``Baby M,'' Danza rushed up to accept the statuette, gushing, ``I
didn't prepare anything! I didn't think he was going to win!''
Later, after his third or fourth time, Danza noted intelligently,
``This was funny the first couple of times, but I'm outta
material.''
   There were moments immune from sneering. Larry Drake received a
warm ovation when he was named best supporting actor in a drama for
his sensitive portrayal of the retarded office assistant on ``L.A.
Law.''
   There was an ovation for co-presenters Mary Tyler Moore and Dick
Van Dyke, who played Rob and Laura Petrie on ``The Dick Van Dyke
Show'' in the 1960s. Van Dyke nudged Moore into spouting in her
trademark quaver, ``Oh, Rob!''
   Richard Kiley, who won best lead actor in a drama, brought the
proceedings back to reality when he complained about NBC having, in
fact, canceled his critically praised show, ``A Year in the Life.''
   Michaels brought out some unexpected co-presenters, such as
``Head of the Class'' star Robyn Givens and her heavyweight hubby
Mike Tyson, and newsies Sam Donaldson and George F. Will.
   Hip magicians Penn and Teller presented the wrap-up of the 44
technical awards given out Saturday.
   In perhaps a metaphor for the night, Penn Jillette promised to
drop a Maytag washing machine on his partner if the audience paid
attention to the awards.
   Teller escaped unharmed. So did the Emmys.

<HEAD>7 Hurt As Grenade Explodes In Racial Confrontation</HEAD>

   A racial confrontation between whites
wielding baseball bats and rock- and bottle-throwing blacks
culminated Sunday in the explosion of a grenade, which injured
seven people, authorities said.
   Four of the injured were juveniles, including a 12-year-old.
None of the injuries appeared critical, but one 17-year-old boy was
admitted to Manatee Memorial Hospital for treatment, authorities
said.
   The Manatee County sheriff's office, still trying to piece
together information late Sunday, could not confirm a report that
there was shooting with an automatic weapon.
   Manatee County Sheriff Charlie Wells said authorities believe
they know who threw the grenade, but no arrests had been made by
late Sunday after the incident in the parking lot of a convenience
store.
   The sheriff's office said all of the injured were black, except
for one 28-year-old man.
   The incident broke out about 6:45 p.m. between a group of blacks
standing in the parking lot and a group of whites who had gathered
at an adjacent bar, Wells said.
   ``It does not appear to be a strictly racial incident even
though the situation basically is between whites and blacks,''
Wells told The Bradenton Herald. ``It does not appear to be
anything that's brewing over a period of time from what we can find
out.''
   However, several residents told the newspaper that racial
tensions have run high in the racially mixed neighborhood called
Duplex City since the opening of the bar.

<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross was
pressured by its vice president and the Swiss government during
World War II into keeping silent on the massacre of Jews by the
Nazis, a Swiss historian says.
   The charge comes from Professor Jean-Claude Favez, who was
invited by the Geneva-based Red Cross to examine its wartime
records and settle the Holocaust controversy that still shadows the
125-year-old organization.
   Red Cross Director-General Jacques Moreillon, who played a key
role in opening the files to Favez six years ago, says the
historian's verdict stems from hindsight and that a public appeal
by the Red Cross over the massacres of European Jews would have
jeopardized its humanitarian work in Nazi Germany.
   About 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the
Holocaust.
   Favez and Moreillon spoke in a TV documentary broadcast Sunday
by the British Broadcasting Corp. in its ``Everyman'' series, which
examines moral quandaries like the one the Red Cross faced over the
Holocaust.
   The Red Cross has always observed a code of silence and
neutrality before such atrocities, believing that this alone wins
it the trust of governments and access to jails and prisoner-of-war
camps from which partisan organizations would be banned.
   Favez argued, however, that enough information about the
genocide of the Jews had filtered out of Germany by the summer of
1942 to persuade Red Cross officers that they should break with
tradition and issue a public protest.
   The records show that the draft of a protest circulated among
the 23 members of the International Committee of the Red Cross and
that at a special meeting on Oct. 14, 1942, 21 of the 23 members
favored publishing it, the BBC said.
   But the majority vote was overruled by Carl-Jacob Burckhardt,
then the organization's vice president and its dominant figure, and
by Philippe Etter, president of Switzerland and a Red Cross
committee member, the documentary said, citing the documents
uncovered by Favez.
   ``The Swiss government was desperately worried that Switzerland
would be invaded by the Nazis, and it was determined to muzzle any
Red Cross protest that might provoke them,'' the BBC said.
   Moreillon, the director-general, said that before he read
Favez's report, ``my gut feeling was that the committee should have
spoken out. After reading it, strangely enough, I came to the
conclusion that at that time _ perhaps it would have been different
later _ but at that time, in October 1942, it was probably the
wisest course.''
   He said the information about the Holocaust then was ``extremely
flimsy ... the facts were not really known. It was an impression.''
   Moreillon added: ``We would have run a considerable risk (by
protesting). We would have looked perhaps better but the prisoners
would not.''
   Favez said the Red Cross feared the Nazis would retaliate by
withdrawing from the Geneva conventions of that time, which allowed
the Red Cross to visit prisoners of war on both sides, give them
letters and food parcels, and lobby for better prison conditions.
   In addition, the conventions in 1942 did not yet cover
civilians. Thus, the Germans could have claimed the Jews were not
the business of the Red Cross, the BBC said.
   Nonetheless, according to Red Cross documents shown in the
documentary, those agreements did not prevent Burckhardt from
appealing directly to SS commander Heinrich Himmler on behalf of a
personal friend in a concentration camp.
   ``There's no evidence that Burckhardt used his influence on
behalf of the Jews,'' the BBC said.
   Favez doubted the Germans would have renounced the conventions,
saying: ``There were German prisoners of war in Allied hands. Any
unilateral action against the conventions by the Reich would have
left these prisoners defenseless. So I think the Red Cross
exaggerated the risk.''
   He also disagreed that the Red Cross lacked sufficient evidence
of genocide in 1942.
   The Nazis had decided that spring on liquidating the Jews, and
Favez said eyewitness accounts and reports sent back by Red Cross
delegates in Berlin were already persuasive.
   ``It was fragmentary information, but it clearly suggested the
Nazis were massacring Jews on a large scale,'' he said.
   Moreillon replied: ``It is only now, with the pictures we have
seen after the concentration camps, that we put these things
together ... In 1942, I genuinely believe that people could not
imagine the unimaginable ...''

   Donald Trump has one in the back seat of his
limo. Most senators keep one. And political candidates are hooked
on them.
   Some brewing scandal? No, just the ubiquitous telephone
facsimile machine, or ``fax'' _ the breadbox-sized gizmos that make
sending a letter as easy as dialing the phone.
   ``It's probably the most important piece of office equipment
that we have,'' says Gordon Hensley, press aide to Republican
Senate candidate Peter Dawkins of New Jersey.
   Jim Abbott, spokesman for Dawkins' Democratic opponent, Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, adds, ``When our computer goes down, we're
inconvenienced. But when our fax machine isn't working, we're in
deep doo-doo.''
   The machines, now relied upon by virtually all large campaigns
and major news organizations as well as big-time businessmen like
Trump, have become the electronic mailman for politics and
government.
   At The Associated Press newsroom in Washington, would-be
newsmakers have to line up to get through on the ever-busy machine.
George Bush's daily schedule might come in first, followed by a
weather map, then some congressman's announcement of drought relief
for his district.
   The almost-instant transmissions have rendered obsolete the
full-time motorcycle couriers once dispatched to pick up film and
press releases.
   Even the capital's omnipresent army of bicycle-riding couriers
has seen its workload fall to inhuman competition.
   Facsimile machines, as the names implies, send replicas of
letters and other documents over telephone lines. They transmit at
speeds as fast as 12 seconds a page, with quality nearly as good as
the original.
   The machines use digital scanners to read pages, and talk to
each other via internal modems _ the same devices that connect
computers.
   In the past two years, sales of the machines have skyrocketed.
The gadgets have meanwhile come down in size and price.
   The Japanese-based Sharp Electronics Corp., the leader in U.S.
facsimile machine sales, says the overall fax market grew by 220
percent in 1987. Sharp, with American headquarters in Mahwah, N.J.,
sold 12,000 machines in both November and December.
   Though fax addicts are relatively new, few can _ or want to _
recall what they did without the handy machines.
   Mark Brown, a spokesman for Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., recalls
only too well what he did with the congressman's press releases. He
called newspaper after newspaper and dictated.
   ``I would spend hours and hours on the phone reading the same
thing over and over,'' Brown said. ``I would get crazy.''
   There is a down side to the high technology, Brown says. At
least with his dictation, he knew he was talking to a person.
   Brown says he must make follow-up calls to make sure the
material he's sent hasn't wound up in electronic Never-Never Land
or, more likely, buried under the rest of a fax machine's
relentless output.
   ``I don't have any guarantee that it gets to them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Air Force Cannibalizing B-1's for Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force is so short of spare parts for
the B-1 bomber that mechanics have to take parts off grounded
planes to permit others to continue training flights, congressional
investigators say.
   But the Air Force disputes conclusions by the congressional
General Accounting Office that it still ``has not been able to meet
training and readiness objectives'' for the B-1.
   ``Reliability shortfalls _ parts failing faster than expected _
continue to be a major cause of spare parts shortages,'' GAO said
in a study released by Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee and a chief congressional critic of the
7-year-old bomber.
   Aspin and other critics say the B-1 isn't working as well as the
Air Force said it would. The Air Force says the plane is performing
as expected and says most problems thus far have been common bugs
experienced by all new weapons systems.
   President Reagan resurrected the B-1 in 1981, four years after
it was killed by President Carter, and ordered the Air Force to buy
100 of the planes for use in the nation's arsenal of long-range
weapons.
   The GAO report was released Saturday by Aspin, a week after
another Congressional Budget Office study also made public by Aspin
said improvements to the B-1 could cost up to $3.4 billion.
   Capt. Jay DeFrank, a spokesman for the service, maintained that
the Air Force is ``making steady progress in assuring adequate
spare parts are available.''
   ``The most important point is that the B-1B is performing its
deterrent mission right now,'' said DeFrank. ``Today, B-1B aircraft
have trained crews and fly the necessary sorties to meet wartime
requirements.
   ``The Air Force has steadily improved the planned rate of B-1B
training flights and expects that trend to continue as the system
matures and spare parts are delivered.''
   The GAO did say the Air Force is doing a better job than in 1987.
   ``The Air Force's and contractor's attention to priority parts
has resolved some parts problems, but a more systematic approach
would ensure early and appropriate attention to the problem
parts,'' the study said.
   If there were shortages of spare parts affecting training
flights, those shortages could also affect the number of planes
available during wartime, Aspin noted.
   ``Alert status is the bomber's reason for being. If that's
adversely affected _ and it is here _ then you've got problems,''
he said.
   The last B-1 was delivered April 30. The Air Force says the
entire program will cost $27.3 billion, excluding improvements.
   The B-1 will be used in conjunction with the so-called
``stealth'' B-2 bomber to replace aging B-52s as the country's
fleet of long-range nuclear bombers.

   A small plane landed on the
heavily traveled Garden State Parkway Sunday night without injuring
the two occupants or any motorists, police said.
   The two-seat Cessna came down on the southbound lanes of the
parkway about eight miles north of the Atlantic City exit, said
George Waddill, a New Jersey State Police dispatcher.
   ``The pilot incurred some engine problems flying from Bedford,
Mass., to the Atlantic City ... airport at Pomona,'' said State
Police Sgt. Stacy Cranmer. ``He was looking for a place to land.
Fortunately it was the southbound lanes.
   ``He followed the taillights in and landed between the cars.''
   The names of the pilot and passenger were not immediately
available.
   The pilot taxied the plane, which was not damaged, off to the
shoulder of the highway so traffic was not affected, Cranmer said.
   The plane remained along the side of the highway at 11:30 p.m.
as police tried to find someone to remove the wings and haul it,
the sergeant said.

<HEAD>Soviets Begin Destruction of SS-20 Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has begun destroying its SS-20
missiles in line with the U.S.-Soviet pact to eliminate the
superpowers' intermediate-range nuclear forces, according to Tass.
   It said three of the multiple-warhead SS-20s were blown up
Sunday as part of the compliance with steps outlined in the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Under the accord, the two
superpowers are to get rid of all of their nuclear weapons that
have ranges of between 300 and 3,400 miles.
   Tass said Sunday's demolition occurred at the same location
where the SS-20s were tested _ at the Kapustin Yar site 600 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   The official news agency said representatives of the 40-nation
U.N. Conference on Disarmament observed the destruction of the
missiles.
   About 600 SS-20s are to be destroyed at Kapustin Yar in batches
of three or more on the 15th and 30th of each month for the next
three years, Tass said.
   It said that on Thursday, two SS-20s were destroyed by launching
in the Siberian area of Chita amid pine and fir trees.
   One SS-20 was blown up July 22 at Kapustin Yar. American
inspectors insisted that the missile be dismantled so they could
check the dimensions of its stages, and it then was blown up
because it was dangerous in the dismantled state, according to Tass.
   Overall the treaty requires the United States to scrap 867
medium-range nuclear-capable missiles and the Soviet Union to
destroy 1,752.
   The first U.S. weapons destruction under the treaty is scheduled
to begin Sept. 8 when solid-fuel rocket motors for Pershing II
missiles are to be destroyed at the Longhorn Army Ammunitions plant
near Marshall, Texas.

   The minister didn't get to the
church on time, but it came as little surprise to the 450 guests
because the man presiding over the ceremony was notoriously tardy
campaigner Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson arrived an hour after the scheduled start of Saturday's
wedding for businessman Ahmad Bayaa, 35, and bride Jill Maria
Baumgartner, 24, of Laguna Hills, then performed a 10-minute
ceremony in the gazebo of the ritzy Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
   The Baptist minister and former Democratic presidential hopeful
was running behind because he was in Washington earlier in the day
for the 25th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have A
Dream Speech.''
   But Jackson's late arrival here didn't bother the groom.
   ``I love Jesse,'' Bayaa said. ``I have met him twice, and I
thought it would be fantastic if Jesse does this wedding because he
represents the conscience of the people in America.''
   Besides, had Jackson never arrived, the couple still would be
husband and wife. They were married earlier in the day; Jackson's
was to be the second ceremony of the day.

   Slugger Don Mattingly predicted he would
not finish his career with the New York Yankees because owner
George Steinbrenner eventually will become angry with him and trade
the All-Star first baseman.
   ``It's going to happen,'' Mattingly said Sunday. ``He's got to
do what he's got to do.''
   He acknowledged that his criticism of Steinbrenner may have
sparked the trade rumors that began surfacing this weekend.
   Mattingly, who will earn $2.2 million in 1989 and $2.5 million
in 1990, the final season of his three-year contract, sharply
criticized Steinbrenner a week ago, although he did not name the
owner.
   Pat Gillick, Toronto Blue Jays general manager, predicted New
York will trade Mattingly, possibly before the season ends.
   But Bob Quinn, Yankees general manager, said Mattingly most
likely wouldn't be traded.
   Other teams ``generally asked us about his availability and our
answer was `No, not unless you can overwhelm us.' My guess is there
isn't a team in baseball that can satisfy us,'' Quinn said.

   Opposing views on freedom of expression and
religion clashed at the Venice Film Festival over attempts to stop
the showing of Martin Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   The movie, considered sacrilegious or blasphemous by some, is
one of 60 films to be featured at the festival that started today
and runs through Sept. 9, and is not among the 22 competing for the
Golden Lion Award.
   Italy's dominant Christian Democrat party and some Roman
Catholic leaders and groups have condemned Scorsese's film as
blasphemous because of a scene that depicts Jesus on the cross
hallucinating about abandoning his role as a redeemer, making love
to Mary Magdalene and raising a family with her.
   Venice's prosecutor has asked a judge to ban the film in Venice
under Italy's laws on obscenity and blasphemy. The judge has not
made a decision.
   ``It's amazing that still today after many battles for civil
rights, the right of the film festival to feature movies chosen for
their artistic value can be questioned,'' said Paolo Portoghesi,
president of the Venice Biennale, which organizes the festival.
   Festival director Guglielmo Biraghi said Sunday he ``is in favor
of the controversy and therefore welcomes it'' because it nourishes
the 56-year-old film festival, the world's oldest.
   Among the U.S. films competing for the Golden Lion are David
Mamet's ``Things Change,'' Ivan Passer's ``Haunted Summer'' and
Alan Ruolph's ``The Moderns.''
   Italian director Franco Zeffirelli's ``Young Toscanini'' will
have its premier at the festival, although he once threatened to
withdraw it if ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' was not
rescheduled.
   ``Toscanini'' originially was scheduled to be shown a day after
Scorsese's. Zeffirelli said he wanted ``distance between the
films,'' apparently so his new work would not be overlooked in the
controversy. Now ``Young Toscanini'' will be shown two days before
Scorsese's.

   If you're against both George Bush and Michael
Dukakis, don't despair _ there are 314 others to choose from so far
this year, including two teen-age boys and two men who say they are
in jail.
   A recent letter to 15-year-old candidate Ary Dov Rosenbaum of
New York prompted the following explanation:
   ``I am running as a protest against the other candidates. I
didn't take any trips with Donna Rice. ... I just feel with these
kind of people running our nation we are headed for disaster.''
   Donna Rice is the model who went on a boat trip with former
candidate Gary Hart.
   Robert Bryant Haynes, 16, of Hertford, N.C. confided that he has
a 14-year-old running mate, wants a 50 percent cut in taxes, is
against abortion and would work for the colonization of Mars.
   None of the 314 got any votes at the major party conventions,
but 56 of them have told the Federal Election Commission that they
have collected or spent at least $5,000 on their campaigns.
   Candidates have not done well in recent years unless they were
nominated by the Democrats or Republicans. John Anderson, a former
Republican congressman, ran as an independent in 1980 and won
5,720,060 votes _ 6.6 percent of the total _ but has hardly been
heard of since then.
   A possible No. 3 in the results this year is Ron Paul, another
Republican ex-congressman. His Libertarian Party ran third in 1984
but got only 228,314 votes, to 54,455,075 for President Reagan and
37,577,185 for former Vice President Walter Mondale.
   The Libertarians generally call for as little government as
possible _ less interference in private lives at home and less U.S.
activism overseas.
   ``There is nothing in the Constitution to justify the choosing
of one thug regime over another in a foreign war,'' Paul said. ``We
should not have tangling foreign alliances. We should have a strong
military, but only in the United States.''
   His phrase echoed Thomas Jefferson's at his first inaugural in
1801: ``Honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances
with none.''
   Libertarian planks this year also include repeal of laws against
victimless crimes and an end to taxation of land.
   Like many other countries, this one has both a Liberal and a
Conservative Party, but they operate largely in New York and have
little to do with national politics.
   Willa Kenoyer of Shelby, Mich., has been nominated by the
Socialist Party and is trying to get on the ballot in 20 of the 50
states.
   ``If our vote runs into five figures we'll be happy,'' said Anne
Rosenhaft, the party's executive secretary. ``We expect to do
better in the 21st century.''
   In 1920 Eugene Debs, in jail for opposition to World War I, ran
on the Socialist ticket and received 915,490 votes.
   Getting on the ballot is tedious as well as expensive for minor
candidates. It usually requires the collection of thousands of
signatures in each state. Voters may write in the names of any of
the 514 or anyone else who strikes their fancy but that can be
difficult when voting is by machine. Few do it.
   The Communist Party is not running a candidate for the
presidency this year.
   ``It's enormously difficult and just too expensive,'' said Louis
Diskin of the party's Education Department.
   Gus Hall, its perennial leader, got 36,386 votes in 1984. Diskin
said Hall is continuing to make speeches, working through labor
unions and other organizations in which the party has members.
   Diskin and Rosenhaft spoke by telephone from their party
headquarters in New York.
   The Prohibition Party claims to be one of the oldest, dating
back to 1869. It opposes not only alcohol, but ``communism and all
other totalitarian ideologies.'' National prohibition of alcoholic
beverages was authorized by an amendment to the Constitution in
1920, but repealed in 1933.
   In 1984 the Prohibition candidate, Earl Dodge, got only 4,242
votes, but he is trying again this time.
   Glenn Day has compiled a book called ``Minor Presidential
Candidates and Parties of 1988'' by writing letters to more that
200 people from the Federal Election Commission's list. He got
about 60 replies.
   Day quotes one of his correspondents as writing in August of
last year that he is ``a prisoner now confined.'' Another is
reported as claiming:
   ``I am the only person to start his campaign three different
times from inside a prison.''
   Young Rosenbaum and Haynes also have some time to wait. The
Constitution requires that a president be 35 years old.
   Frederick S. Eiland, the election commission's press officer,

<HEAD>Agriculture Dept. Urged to Stop Subsidizing Wheat Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. food prices could go even higher unless
the Agriculture Department stops subsidizing wheat sales to foreign
countries, three consumer groups say.
   Representatives of the Consumers Union, Community Nutrition
Institute and the Consumer Federation of America, in a letter
released Sunday, urged USDA to suspend its Export Enhancement
Program.
   The three groups said continuing wheat export subsidies under
the program ``may further jeopardize the supply of this essential
food grain'' and push food prices even higher.
   Drought has reduced U.S. crop production sharply this year,
including wheat, and has eaten deeply into reserve stockpiles.
   Although grain prices have risen sharply as supplies have
fallen, Agriculture Department officials have said repeatedly that
there are ample stocks to meet domestic and foreign demands until
new harvests are ready next year.
   But the consumer groups said that if wheat export subsidies
continue at their recent pace, it could result in ``a rise in food
prices greater than now expected in 1989'' because of this year's
drought.
   ``At the very least, USDA should suspend general use of the
Export Enhancement Program for wheat and other food and feed
commodities in the year ahead,'' the letter said. ``Next year is a
period of great uncertainty.''
   The consumer interests cited an Aug. 17 subsidy of between $93
and $103 a ton for a 198,000-ton shipment of flour to Egypt, a
total subsidy of about $20 million.
   ``It is hard to justify any subsidy on grain, but there is no
economic justification for subsidizing U.S. milling companies
whatsoever,'' they said.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program or EEP, private companies
are given free surplus commodities owned by the government to
compensate them for selling designated products _ wheat and other
items _ to selected foreign countries at reduced prices.
   The idea behind the program, which was authorized by Congress in
the 1985 farm law, is to sell commodities at prices that meet those
of competitors, notably the European Economic Community, which also
uses subsidies to cut export prices.
   Since June 4, 1985, EEP has been used in more than 100
``initiatives'' or arrangements with dozens of countries to sell
nearly 67 million metric tons of U.S. farm products, including 44.2
million tons of wheat, 2.5 million tons of flour, 5.96 million tons
of barley, lesser amounts of sorghum, rice, poultry feed, vegetable
oil, frozen poultry and live dairy cattle, and 385.7 million eggs.
   In all, the total sales value of those items as of Aug. 18 was
about $5.5 billion. The estimated value of the EEP bonuses, or
subsidies, totaled $2.99 billion, according to the Agriculture
Department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   Earlier this month, China was given approval for a new line of
EEP subsidy to buy an additional 2 million tons of U.S. wheat.
Under various authorizations since Jan. 26, 1987, China already had
bought about 7 million tons of wheat under the subsidy program.
   The Soviet Union also has been a big user of the subsidy
program, buying about 13 million tons of wheat since April 30, 1987.

<HEAD>King's Widow Calls for Rededication to `Dream'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
says his famous ``I have a dream'' speech 25 years ago helped end
official segregation in the United States, but that ``the cancer of
racism'' still must be fought.
   Coretta Scott King, widow of the slain civil rights leader,
helped lead thousands of marchers over the weekend as they retraced
the steps of the 1963 March on Washington that was highlighted by
King's oration.
   Singing ``We Shall Overcome,'' Mrs. King was joined by
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis and black leader
Jesse Jackson at the head of the procession.
   At the Washington Monument, Dukakis urged the marchers to
continue the struggle for justice for all Americans.
   ``We have to march not just so that some of us can reach the top
of the hill,'' Dukakis said. ``We must march until every American
has reached the bright sunshine of opportunity, until we can stand,
and stand together, in the golden glow of our shared dream.''
   Republican presidential nominee George Bush and his running
mate, Dan Quayle, did not respond to invitations to attend the
rally, organizers said.
   Mrs. King said the 1963 march ``helped break the spine of racial
segregation'' in the United States, and that today ``we still have
a dream of a nation free of the cancer of racism.''
   U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd at 55,000 people, fewer
than the 250,000 who thronged the National Mall for King's famous
oration climaxing the March on Washington on Aug. 28, 1963, a crowd
that was equalled five years ago at a 20th anniversary march.
   Jackson, appearing Sunday on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' said the most immediate task now for organizers is a
``massive voter registration drive'' to bring more blacks, women
and low-income Americans into the electorate.
   Jackson said that under the Reagan administration, there has
been ``less of a commitment to affirmative action, less of a
commitment to civil rights.''
   Jackson had received the biggest cheers during Saturday's march
and speeches when he delivered a scathing attack on Bush.
   ``George Bush is not in Washington today,'' Jackson said. ``He
must not be here for the inauguration next January.''
   ``Today, Reagan and Bush attempt to return us to an old
fortress,'' he said. ``They are trying to rebuild old walls. They
have fought to crush the dream.''
   President Reagan, in California, issued a statement asserting
that since King led the landmark March on Washington in 1963,
``America has made vast progress toward fully achieving Dr. King's
dream of a color-blind society.''

   Crook County's top official credits the
``fumes of the juniper berries and the sagebrush,'' but for
whatever reason voters here have picked presidential winners in
every election since 1882 except one.
   The county became the nation's last of the bellwether counties
four years ago when Palo Alto County, Iowa, voted for Walter
Mondale.
   The one flaw in Crook County's record came when voters in 1888
reflected the popular vote and backed Grover Cleveland. But the
majority of the nation's electoral votes put Benjamin Harrison in
the White House.
   ``You can call it coincidence or something permeating the air,''
said Dick Hoppes, chairman of the county commissioners and judge of
juvenile court.
   ``Perhaps something transpires from the fumes of the juniper
berries and the sagebrush that affects people's mentality,'' he
said with a grin. ``If I really knew, I could probably use the same
theories and make a fortune in the stock market.''
   But Tim Hibbits, a political pollster from Portland, says it's
just statistical chance.
   ``When you've got thousands and thousands of counties in the
United States, it's just likely that some of them are going to pick
the results every time out,'' saidHibbitts, president of TH
Research Inc.
   He notes that the county's near-perfect voting record holds only
for the presidential elections. It backed the loser in the last
gubernatorial race.
   ``It's like a sports streak,'' Hibbits said. ``Sooner or later
it will be broken. It's interesting to see how long it can go.''
   As for predicting how Crook County will go, local political
observers aren't ready to commit.
   ``Crook County is the one with the accurate voting record, not
me,'' said Jym Smith, publisher of the Central Oregonian and a
transplanted Texan who characterizes the county as staunchly
conservative, even though registered Democrats outnumber
Republicans 3,326 to 2,504.
   ``They do not look outside the community either for help or
interference,'' Smith said. ``We've got a lot of people who moved
here in the Dust Bowl days. A lot of people are descended from
homesteaders. A lot of people moved in and followed the jobs when
the timber industry started to grow.''
   LaSelle Coles, retired manager of the local irrigation district,
says it's not unusual to find a lifelong Democrat like himself
running the local campaign for a Republican like George Bush.
   ``I've always voted for the person I thought would be best for
the job,'' he said.
   Hoppes said residents give about as much thought to the county's
unique bellwether status as they would to pictures of somebody
else's grandchildren.
   ``They would show interest for a moment, because it's the
courteous thing to do, but frankly, they don't give a damn,'' he
said.
   In 1952, however, pollsters took great note of the central
Oregon county located about 150 miles from Portland, and descended
on the area. Since then, Crook County periodically has been sampled.
   Come election day this November, those looking to Crook County
for a hint of the election results will have a long wait. Crook
County counts its ballots by hand, and the county clerk says a
final tally won't be available until early Wednesday.
   Named for Indian fighter Maj. Gen. George Crook, the county is
2,991 square miles of mountains, sagebrush and rimrock east of the
Cascade Range.
   The only incorporated city is Prineville, which has 5,410 of the
county's 13,000 inhabitants.

<HEAD>Fire Burned Most Records of Dukakis' Military Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Details of Michael Dukakis' military career will
probably never be known because a fire that ravaged a government
warehouse in St. Louis 15 years ago destroyed millions of files.
   Records that do exist, however, indicate that the Democratic
presidential candidate spent an uneventful two years in the service
of his country as an enlisted man in post-war Korea.
   The issue of military service has received unusual prominence
this political season since the disclosure that Republican vice
presidential nominee Sen. Dan Quayle secured a spot in the Indiana
National Guard during the 1960s rather than face duty in Vietnam.
   Dukakis' rival, Vice President Bush, and his running mate, Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, both served with distinction as pilots in World
War II.
   By accident of birth, Dukakis belonged to the Korea generation,
sandwiched between World War II in the 1940s and the Vietnam war in
the 1960s.
   ``Governor Dukakis' records were destroyed in a fire that went
through the National Personnel Records Center back in 1973. A
significant number of records were destroyed in that fire,'' said
Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman in Washington.
   Aides to the governor promised to ask him to search his home for
any documents he may have in his possession. No new papers were
forthcoming by late Friday.
   Dukakis graduated at age 17 from Brookline High School in
suburban Boston in the spring of 1951, the year that ultimately
proved to be the bloodiest of the Korean war.
   That September, Dukakis enrolled at Swarthmore College outside
Philadelphia. When he turned 18 in November, he registered for the
military draft. But as a college student, he applied for and
received a student deferment from the military draft. He was
classified 2-S.
   The deferment was routinely renewed during his sophomore and
junior years as Dukakis met the requirements by remaining a student
in good standing. In the meantime, an armistice signed on July 27,
1953, ended the fighting in Korea.
   In 1955, during Dukakis's senior year, he applied to Harvard Law
School and got accepted. But he chose not to apply for a graduate
deferment, telling his family that he wanted to get his military
service behind him so that when he finished law school he could
plunge directly into his career.
   Dukakis volunteered and promptly went on active duty in the
regular Army on July 19, 1955. After basic training at Fort Dix,
N.J., Dukakis went to Camp Gordon, Ga., for training as a radio
operator.
   Later, he was assigned to Munsan, South Korea, just south of the
demilitarized zone in a unit supporting the Military Armistice
Commission attempting to maintain the United Nations cease-fire.
   Jay Levine, a classmate of Dukakis' who served with him in
Korea, is quoted in a biography of Dukakis as saying: ``He didn't
like the Army at all. He was too bright and smart for it. And he
was subject to an immense amount of spit and polish.''
   According to family members, Dukakis was cold and bored and
tried to pass the time by studying the Korean language.
   After 21 months of service, Dukakis was terminated from active
duty on April 25, 1957, with the rank of specialist three. He
received a Good Conduct Medal and an honorable discharge. His
classification was changed to 4-A, indicating veteran, and he was
transferred into the Individual Ready Reserve in the Massachusetts
district.
   At the time, the Individual Ready Reserve was essentially a
roster of recent veterans kept by the government as a pool of
trained personnel who could be called up quickly in case of
emergency. According to military spokesmen, such reserve status was
a routine formality in the late 1950s and did not entail any
specific duties.
   ``I have no records to reflect what Governor Dukakis did as a
member of the IRR,'' said Major Arthur House, a public affairs
officer at the Army Reserve Personnel Center in St. Louis.
   House said the St. Louis facility is the nation's ``central
repository'' of military records. Thus, the 1973 fire wiped out
much information that was kept only there.

   Three coins in the fountain may mean
romance but it's going to take thousands of them to fix it.
   Residents on Sunday lined quarters end to end over 13 blocks to
help raise money to pay a $20,000 repair bill for this rural
community's beloved 50-year-old fountain.
   More than $18,700 was raised, according to a preliminary count.
   ``I think we are going to be close,'' city council member Eva
Knight said.
   Ms. Knight, 44, said she and some bank tellers came up with the
idea when it became clear the city budget couldn't afford the
expense.
   ``I had heard that back in the 1930s when money was very tight
that the Alliance High School band earned money for a trip by
putting a row of dimes down a block,'' she said.
   ``I told our tellers that a quarter today probably isn't worth
what a dime was then, but we still could raise some money. ...
   ``A lot of people remember the fountain from when they were
growing up. They wanted to fix it. Coins and fountains are always
kind of linked. In our case, we put the two together,'' Ms. Knight
said.

   Robert Duck must know something special
about ducks.
   On Sunday, for the seventh time in eight years, his entry into
the Great American Duck Race took first place.
   This time it was with a bird named Pride of the 62nd Army Band,
who marched through a field of web-footed sprinters to capture the
championship at the ninth annual race.
   Duck's stable of 28 entries dominated the weekend festivities,
taking six of eight places in the finals and sweeping the top three
positions.
   Pride was clocked at a blistering 1.08 second on the 16-foot
runway.
   Finishing a fast second was No-Bill Prize, followed by Kiwanis
Quacker.
   Despite pocketing $5,450 for the two-day event, Duck said the
race wasn't easy.
   ``This was truly a tough year for my ducks in the race,'' he
said. ``The competition was as tough as it has ever been with some
serious duck trainers taking part.''
   The Duck family got in the act, too, with Duck's children taking
home $150 for victories in the youth division.
   Last year's champion for Duck, Oliver South, apparently couldn't
take the prerace publicity and pressure and failed to make the
championship round. Oliver South is Duck's fastest fowl and has
been clocked at 0.85 second.
   Some of Duck's stable includes Here's George and Michael
DuQuackis.
   Duck said Pride's name is a tribute to an Army band Duck played
with while in the service.

   It took him 15 years, but 70-year-old Tom
Stear finally has his coveted title: winner of the International
Clamshell Pitching Club tournament.
   ``He was the strong sentimental favorite,'' said the Cape May
club's president, Richard Reinhart.
   Stear rallied in the best-of-five finals from a 2-1 game deficit
and a 14-7 score in the fourth game to defeat Harry Mazuk, the 1986
champion who was in the finals for the third consecutive year.
   The competition is played like horseshoes, Reinhart said, with
points for tossing the approximately 4-inch diameter shells in or
near 4{-inch holes cut into the sand. Two points are tallied each
time a player throws the shell into the hole and one point for the
player closest to the hole.
   The holes are set at 25{ feet.
   Participants must continue to throw broken shells until they are
less than two-thirds their initial size, Reinhart said.
   About 100 people watched Stear win the title in a 78-man field.
Reinhart called the victory a tribute to the champion's ability to
block out occasional rain sprinkles and strong winds.
   ``When it's windy like that, all bets are off,'' Reinhart said.
   In the women's division, Delores Houston, of Levittown, Pa.,
triumphed in a 22-woman field for her third championship. She
defeated Dolly Jacobsen of Media, Pa.

   Two Soviets and the first Afghan in space blasted
off from a Central Asian space center early Monday to join
cosmonauts seeking an endurance record aboard the Soviet Union's
orbiting space station Mir.
   A Proton rocket carrying pilot Vladimir Lyakhov, doctor Valery
Polyakov and Afghan military pilot Abdul Ahmad Mohmand aboard a
Soyuz TM-6 capsule lifted off from the Baikonur space center at
8:23 a.m. Moscow time (12:23 a.m. EDT).
   Soviet television provided a live broadcast of the white rocket
riding a long orange flame into the clear sky, and cut away as the
rocket disappeared. Lift-off was as scheduled.
   While the Soviet cosmonaut and Afghan crew member will return to
Earth after eight days, Polyakov will remain aboard Mir to monitor
the health of its long-time residents, Vladimir Titov and Musa
Manarov, officials said.
   On Dec. 21, Titov, 40, and Manarov, 37, will have been in space
one year, breaking the previous endurance record set by Yuri
Romanenko. Romanenko returned to Earth from a 326-day flight on
Dec. 29.
   Soviet space officials have said Mir will be permanently manned,
and replacements for Titov and Manarov are to be sent aloft in a
joint Soviet-French space flight later this year, said Maj. Gen.
Vladimir Dzhamidekov, deputy director of cosmonaut training at
Baikonur.
   His boss, Vladimir Shatalov, said Titov and Manarov will return
to Earth in late December but did not give an exact date or say
whether Polyakov will accompany them.
   Soviet space officials have said the long flights are designed
to test whether people can withstand weightlessness and the other
conditions for a possible manned mission to Mars, a journey that
would take three years.
   With an Afghan spaceman on board, this week's flight has as much
political as scientific significance.
   The flight was originally scheduled for the middle of next year,
but was moved up to Monday, apparently so it would fall near the
halfway point in the Soviet withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
   Radio Moscow reported Sunday that Mohmand, a 29-year-old veteran
military pilot, was chosen from two candidates training to be the
first Afghan in space.
   Radio Moscow said the Soyuz TM-6 will dock with the Soviet
Union's orbiting space station, Mir (Peace), on Wednesday.
   Mohmand himself was part of the joint Soviet-Afghan effort to
put down an insurgency in his homeland. He said in an interview
published Sunday in the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya that he had
flown 500 attack flights against insurgents.
   The Soviet Union began pulling out its more than 100,000 troops
from Afghanistan on May 15 and reached the halfway mark Aug. 15.
   During the pullout, the Kremlin has flooded the official media
with reports emphasizing that economic, scientific and cultural
contacts will increase as Soviet-Afghan military links are scaled
back.
   Afghanistan highlighted the political significance of the joint
mission by sending an official delegation headed by Mohammad Aslam
Watanjar, Afghanistan's communications minister and member of its
ruling Politburo, to Baikonur.
   Science also figures prominently in the mission. Mohmand told
Sovietskaya Rossiya the cosmonauts will use instruments aboard Mir
to search for potential mining areas in his homeland and to measure
oil and gas deposits.
   To help alleviate a water shortage in Afghanistan, the
cosmonauts also will be looking at snow and glaciers in mountains
and will assess the hydroelectric potential of Afghanistan's
rivers, Mohmand said.
   The spacemen also will try to locate regions in Afghanistan
where earthquakes might occur.
   The 46-year-old Polyakov, making his first space flight, is to
supervise experiments on the effects of space travel on the body.
   The Afghan-Soviet mission is the second of three missions
scheduled this year in the Soviet manned space program. It comes
after the U.S. manned program was grounded after the January 1986
explosion of the shuttle Challenger. The shuttle Discovery is
expected to be launched in late September or early October.
   A Bulgarian cosmonaut and two Soviet colleagues returned to
Earth June 17 after a 10-day flight that included a linking with
Mir. A Soviet-French crew is to blast off Nov. 21 for a monthlong
mission.

<HEAD>Restraint Seen in South Asian Nuclear Arms Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changing political and strategic factors may
be opening the way for limited nuclear arms non-proliferation pacts
with India, Pakistan and even China, according to a Senate study
published Sunday.
   The report by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff
concludes that despite their advanced atomic energy programs,
neither India nor Pakistan has chosen to undertake an overt nuclear
weapons project.
   The report concludes that India could produce a dozen to 18
nuclear weapons a year and that Pakistan is capable of
manufacturing only one to three such weapons annually.
   But the report prepared by Peter W. Galbraith, a South Asia
expert on the committee staff, says both Pakistan and India see
strategic disadvantages in the general spread of nuclear weapons in
South Asia.
   It says this ``provides an incentive for each to take steps to
keep the region free of nuclear weapons.''
   And it says that with negotiation, ``A nuclear weapons free zone
that included parts of China and the Indian Ocean as well as South
Asia might be achievable.''

<HEAD>Technology May Stall Tax Growth, Says Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study says modern technology that is
making it easier for businesses to move quickly may also spell the
``twilight years'' for the growth of government taxing and
regulatory power.
   Richard B. McKenzie, an economics professor at Clemson
University in South Carolina, said computers, facsimile machines,
satellites and other technologies have enabled businesses to
respond to government intrusion by going elsewhere.
   McKenzie conducted his study for the Washington-based Cato
Institute, a research organization which generally follows a
libertarian philosophy of encouraging the least possible government
intervention in human affairs.
   ``Capital is being freed from the strict confines of arbitrary
national boundaries,'' he wrote. ``As a consequence, the power of
government to tax and regulate may be in its twilight years.''

<HEAD>Kansas City Times Says Quayle Should Be Dropped From Ticket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kansas City Times said in an
editorial that Sen. Dan Quayle should be dropped as the Republican
vice presidential nominee.
   ``Each day seems to bring new questions about the junior senator
from Indiana, some of them concerning his past and others the
result of his vacuous performances in the last two weeks,'' the
newspaper said Saturday. ``If he is serious about the White House,
George Bush will get Quayle off the ticket.''
   The Times cited the question of Quayle's service in the National
Guard during the Vietnam War, but also said that controversy had
obscured other questions about Quayle and his suitability for the
vice presidency.
   The paper said Quayle had raised doubts about his knowledge of
the nation's farm policy when he appeared Thursday at the Missouri
State Fair in Sedalia.
   At that appearance, Quayle could not define agricultural target
prices when a reporter asked him. He referred two other farm policy
questions to Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who was appearing with
him.

   Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum says the
flap over Dan Quayle's service in the National Guard might hurt the
Republican vice presidential nominee's effectiveness as a spokesman
on national defense.
   ``I think (Michael) Dukakis was vulnerable on that issue,''
Kassebaum, of Kansas, said Saturday. ``I felt Quayle's strength was
defense _ this may have diminished that.''
   In a speech to the Kansas Independent Bankers Association,
Kassebaum said she is disturbed about the tone of the presidential
campaign so far, including tactics being used by Vice President
George Bush.
   Kassebaum said Bush should spend more time talking about the
economy, and less time criticizing Dukakis for his veto of a bill
requiring teachers to lead schoolchildren in the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   ``It used to be that the political campaigns didn't even start
until after Labor Day, and I think we were better off then,''
Kassebaum said. ``It disturbs me to see the political camps
spending their time talking about such things as burning flags or
the pledge of allegiance.''

   Vice president George Bush leads
Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis by a slim margin
in Missouri, according to a poll published by The Kansas City Times.
   An Aug. 20 and 21 survey of 550 Missouri residents likely to
vote in the November election showed Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, with a 48 percent to 39 percent lead over
Dukakis, the Democratic choice. The other 13 percent were undecided.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage
points.
   The Times-Star@KCTV poll published Sunday found that 54 percent
of Missouri residents have a favorable opinion of Bush, compared to
the 48 percent who view Dukakis favorably.
   It showed Bush's running mate Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana with a
25 percent unfavorable rating, compared to 17 percent who had an
unfavorable impression of Dukakis' vice presidential nominee, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Missouri has voted for the winning presidential candidate in
each of the last seven elections.

   ABC's baby-boomer series
``thirtysomething'' and ``The Wonder Years'' won Emmys as best
dramatic and comedy shows, upsetting NBC and it's highly touted
``L.A. Law.''
   ABC won 21 awards Sunday, to CBS's 20 and NBC's 19. PBS won
seven, syndicated shows won three and Home Box Office won three in
the first year cable television participated in the awards.
   ``L.A. Law,'' the ensemble drama about the bad and beautiful in
the legal profession, went into the show with the most nominations,
19, but lost its case with Television Academy of Arts and Sciences.
   It won only two Emmys, for supporting actor _ Larry Drake, for
his sensitive portrayal of a retarded office assistant _ and for
editing.
   In all, ``thirtysomething'' won four Emmys, including one for
Patricia Wettig as best supporting actress and Paul Haggis and
Marshall Herskovitz for writing. The show features a cast of baby
boomers facing adult responsibilities.
   ``I suppose if there was another category for most annoying show
on television we'd win that, too,'' said Ed Zwick, co-executive
producer with Herskovitz. Backstage, Herskovitz said, ``We really
didn't expect to win.''
   ``The Wonder Years,'' created by the husband-and-wife writing
team of Neal Marlens and Carol Black, tells the story of the
``thirtysomething'' generation as they grew up in the 1960s.
   It was also a good night for shows that will not return this
fall.
   Richard Kiley won for best lead actor in a drama series in NBC's
canceled ``A Year in the Life.''
   He thanked people on the show, but added, ``I have nothing but
sadness for the corporate myopia that killed a fine show.''
   CBS' ``Frank's Place,'' slated to return later, won three
awards, including one to creator Hugh Wilson for writing and one to
guest actress Beah Richards.
   Tyne Daly of the canceled CBS series ``Cagney & Lacey,'' won as
best lead actress in a drama series.
   Beatrice Arthur of ``The Golden Girls'' was named best lead
actress and costar Estelle Getty as supporting actress for a comedy
series. That made it a sweep for ``The Golden Girls'' cast. Rue
McClanahan won as best lead actress last year and Betty White the
year before.
   John Larroquette captured his fourth straight Emmy as best
supporting actor in a comedy series for his role as the lecherous
prosecutor, Dan Fielding, in NBC's ``Night Court.''
   ``Now I am officially overwhelmed!'' said Larroquette.
   Michael J. Fox won his third consecutive award for NBC's
``Family Ties.'' Later, as a presenter, Fox said, ``I want to thank
Dan Quayle for showing that Alex Keaton really can exist.''
   NBC's ``The Murder of Mary Phagan,'' based on the lynching of
Leo Frank in a murder case 75 years ago that stirred anti-Semitism
in the South, won best miniseries. NBC's ``Inherit the Wind'' won
as best drama or comedy special and CBS's ``Irving Berlin's 100th
Birthday Celebration'' was best variety, music or comedy program.
   Jason Robards was picked as best lead actor in a miniseries or
special for NBC's ``Inherit the Wind'' and Jessica Tandy as best
lead actress fo CBS' `Foxfire.'' Jane Seymour was named best
supporting actress in a miniseries for ABC's ``Onassis: The Richest
Man in the World.'' John Shea won as best supporting actor in the
ABC miniseries ``Baby M.''
   The Emmy show, produced by Lorne Michaels of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' ran three hours and 21 minutes on Fox Broadcasting Co.,
much shorter than in past years.
   ``This show won't take itself too seriously,'' Michaels said.
   To that end, it featured a ``designated acceptor'' for absent
winners _ actor Tony Danza. He was kept busy throughout the night
as others winners were not present, and after a half-dozen walks to
the stage, he cracked: ``Now I'm mad; where are these people?''

<HEAD>Tribal Leaders, Local Government Officials Praise Settlement Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An American Indian tribal leader says a
$162 million land-claims settlement, one of the largest this
century, will offer prosperity for the tribe's members, who stand
to receive $20,000 each.
   After four years of negotiations, the Puyallup Indian Tribe
voted overwhelmingly to accept the settlement and drop a legal
challenge for the one-time reservation land that included parts of
downtown Tacoma.
   The settlement calls for the federal government to pay $77.5
million. The rest would be paid by Washington state, Tacoma, the
port and private industry. It must still be approved by Congress
and President Reagan.
   ``The tribal membership has voted to express their belief that
our children's future can best be secured through the settlement
process rather than through the uncertainty of a lengthy court
battle,'' Bill Sterud, chairman of the Tribal Council, said after
Saturday's 319-162 vote.
   ``It's been a long, long battle for our people to finally get
the opportunity to have a future of prosperity.''
   The settlement also calls for a four-year job-training program
to serve 265 people; a $22 million permanent trust fund for
social-service projects; a $10 million fish-enhancement program;
$9.5 million for the tribe to buy land and pursue economic
opportunities; plus land around the Blair Waterway on which to
build its own port.
   At issue was ownership within the boundaries of the old
reservation, which included parts of downtown and the Tacoma
Tideflats, now home of the booming Port of Tacoma, the nation's
16th largest port.
   Treaties from the 1850s gave the Puyallups a reservation of
about 18,000 acres, but holdings dwindled as land allotted to
individual members was sold in what tribal historians say often
were shady or fraudulent deals.
   Two decades ago, about all that was left was a 35-acre cemetery.
But activists fought the state and local governments over treaty
rights and land claims, and vigorous enrollment efforts boosted the
tribe's membership from a low of 400 to about 1,500 today.
   In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ruling giving the tribe
title to 12 acres of former Puyallup River bed. That opened the
question of whether the tribe could claim to more land.
   In February 1986, the tribe voted 118-102 to reject a $140
million settlement. If the tribe rejected the latest proposal, it
would have gone to court to claim the land.
   ``I'm very, very elated,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who
played a key role in the negotiations. ``I think it's a victory for
the tribe and a victory for the community. ... It's been a lot of
work.''
   ``It's fantastic,'' said John McCarthy, a port commissioner and
another negotiator. ``We're very pleased with the results.''
   Dicks said he and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the
Select Committee on Indian Affairs, will introduce legislation in
both houses of Congress to provide the federal funding needed for
the settlement.
   ``There's still a lot of challenges,'' Dicks said. ``The thing
that's good is that now the tribe and the community will be working
as a team.''
   Frank Wright Jr., who chaired the Tribal Council during the 1986
settlement vote, said one factor behind the tribe's strong
endorsement was fear over the outcome of a protracted court battle.
   ``When you go to court, nobody really wins, and it's a lengthy,
costly process, and a lot of individuals realized that they
wouldn't live long enough to see it resolved,'' he said.
   Officials of the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs said it was
one of the biggest Indian land-claim settlements ever proposed. The
Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 provided $1 billion to settle
claims on 44 million acres.

   Share prices declined sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Monday, while the U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese
yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the exchange's
main index, slumped 299.81 points or 1.08 percent to close at
27,379.10 after shedding more than 450 points last week.
   The U.S. dollar opened 0.40 yen higher than last Friday's close
of 133.90 yen and gained further in early trading. It closed the
day at 134.20 yen, up 0.70 yen from Friday.
   Stock prices showed signs of recovery in early morning trading
when the index started the day 143.39 points higher than Saturday's
close. Heavy profit-taking, however, pushed share prices down.
   Volume traded on the first section, where most major shares are
listed, was a light 430 million shares.
   Despite the Nikkei's decline, securities dealers said the market
situation was improving gradually.
   ``The slight decline in the morning was a result of profit
taking,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Heavy profit taking means
share prices are moving upward.''
   Another dealer said: ``Today is virtually the first of the month
for securities companies. Most brokerage firms traditionally make
an extra effort to promote the sale of shares on the first few days
of the new month.''
   Transactions made after Monday will formally go into the
September account of securities firms.

<TEXT>
   The Italian air force stunt team whose performance
went tragically awry in West Germany has had three other fatal
crashes over the past decade.
   Sunday's tragedy was the worst, however. Three pilots of the
famed troupe died when two planes plunged to the ground and a third
veered uncontrollably into a huge air show crowd after flying over
the U.S. Air Base in Ramstein.
   Authorities said at least 40 people were killed and 500 injured.
   The three jets were part of a 10-plane Italian Air Force
demonstration team, ``Frecce Tricolori,'' which means Tri-Color
Arrows and refers to the three-colored Italian flag.
   Founded in 1930 as a school of aerobatics, it has since 1956
been a separate unit of the Italian air force based at Rivolto.
   Three members of the precision team have been killed in the
previous air crashes.
   One, Capt. Pier Gianni Petri, was credited with saving the lives
of spectators at a May 29, 1979, air show at Mildehall in Britain
by directing his G91 jet away from the crowd when it crashed.
   Two of the unit's G91 jets collided over the airport at Rivolto
on July 12, 1978, killing one of the two pilots, Capt. Graziano
Carrer. On Sept. 2, 1981, another G91 crashed at Rivolto, killing
Capt. Antonio Gallus.
   The three pilots killed in the collision Sunday at Ramstein were
Lt. Col. Mario Naldini, 41, Lt. Col. Ivo Nutarelli, 38, and Capt.
Giorgio Alessio, 31. Italian Air Force officials said Naldini had
3,900 flight hours, Nutarelli had 3,800 and Alessio had 1,600.
   The men were flying Aermacchi MB 339As, a two-seat attack
aircraft that the Italian air force also uses for pilot training.
   The Frecce Tricolori includes 14 pilots, three technical
officers and 55 specialists.
   Aircraft used by Frecce Tricolori are painted blue with
longitudinal stripes of red, white and green, the colors of the
Italian flag.
   To be a member of the team, a pilot must have at least six years
of experience and a minimum of 1,000 hours of flight time. Military
officials say that the team members actually have an average of
3,000 flight hours and an average age of 32.
   The team appears at numerous shows in Italy and abroad between
April and October each year and spends the intervening months
practicing its aerobatic routines.
   During a show there are normally nine planes in formation, one
soloist and the commander remains on the field coordinating the
action by radio.

<HEAD>Former Nun Wins Legal Battle Against New Jersey Law On Funding For
Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JO ASTRID GLADING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former nun who left her
religious order to enlist in the civil rights movement won a
seven-year legal battle when a judge ruled unconstitutional New
Jersey's system of paying for public education.
   Marilyn Morheuser, 64, said that at times during the fight, she
imagined she knew how David felt trying to slay Goliath.
   Administrative Law Judge Steven Lefelt concluded Thursday that
the state's funding discriminates against poor urban districts and
perpetuates wide budget disparities between wealthy and poor school
districts.
   ``This case is about the failure of the state to provide an
opportunity to develop children's potential,'' Ms. Morheuser said.
``I think we all suffer tremendously when children are not given
opportunity to develop their full potential.''
   Lefelt's ruling is one of a few in the country in which state
education funding has been declared unconstitutional. It follows
two decades of legal and legislative battles and could force the
state to spend millions more each year to aid local schools. In the
1988-89 school year alone, the state will spend more than $3
billion.
   Lefelt concluded that a child in an affluent district clearly
enjoys broad advantages over one in a poor urban district.
   ``I believe this case comes down to whether this state desires
to enhance the educational opportunity of students living in poor
urban areas,'' he said.
   ``Suffice it to say that I opt for providing equal opportunity
to all our children, no matter where they may live.''
   He endorsed a statewide school tax so all property owners pay
the same rate, and letting the state make up the difference so all
students are paid for equally. He called it the only way to control
spending differences.
   ``Urban educators needed this victory to provide the opportunity
for the urban children who are predominantly minority children,''
said Anthony Scardaville, superintendent of the Irvington Public
School system, whose 9,000 enrollment is 82 percent black and 11
percent Hispanic. ``Everybody should have the same _ not good for
the rich and mediocre for the poor.''
   The state had argued that pouring more money in poor districts
was not a solution because their problems are mostly the result of
bad management. It also argued that more state money would erode
local control of schools.
   John Samerjan, a spokesman for Gov. Thomas H. Kean, said the
ruling is one step in a long process, but it would be mistaken to
think it will bring a ``massive infusion of funds'' to poor
districts.
   The case has been closely watched around the country, said Allen
Odden, a school finance expert at the University of Southern
California.
   For Ms. Morheuser, the ruling is a landmark in a career that
spans four decades.
   After 16 teaching years as a nun in the Sisters of Loretto
religious order, she left the convent to help the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People work on school
desegregation. For her, the civil rights movement ``was absolutely
essential for the continued viability of democracy in this
country.''
   At 46, when most people are beginning to think about retirement,
Ms. Morheuser entered law school to help ``litigate social
changes.''
   In 1979, she became director of the Newark-based Education Law
Center, which brought the lawsuit on behalf of 20 school-age
children in four poor urban districts. She said the failure of a
1975 school funding law was creating obvious and growing inequities
between rich and poor districts.
   ``I have always felt a particular affinity to this case because
of my years of teaching,'' she said.
   A similar battle in the early 1970s led to passage of the 1975
law. But Ms. Morheuser said that by 1979, it was obvious the system
wasn't working.
   Education Commissioner Saul Cooperman has 45 days to accept,
modify or reject Lefelt's ruling, but lawyers for both sides
predict the case eventually will go to the state Supreme Court.

<DATELINE>SHOSHONE NATIONAL FOREST, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters created their
own inferno, burning 500 acres of timber to save two towns and
smother the largest fire in Yellowstone National Park.
   By burning the forest ahead of the 182,000-acre Clover Mist
fire, firefighters said, they finally scored a victory after weeks
on the defensive. The blaze would choke without fuel before it
could cross a highway and bear down on Crandall, Wyo., Cooke City,
Mont., both towns of 100 residents, and valuable timber forests,
officials said.
   ``It wanted to rear up and get us but we're going to get it
first,'' said Pat Kaunert, U.S. Forest Service fire information
officer. ``We're throwing everything we've got at it. We've got to
make a stand.''
   While they made their stand, firefighters on Sunday held ground
elsewhere.
   In western Montana, the 1,900-acre Lolo Creek fire was blocked
after coming within 100 yards of eight homes along U.S. 12. Bombers
dropped chemical retardant on the 8,100-acre fire between
Philipsburg and Drummond.
   In the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness north of Yellowstone, the
39,800-acre Storm Creek fire was relatively calm but had burned
several miles toward Slough Creek, which leads into the park,
officials said.
   In Idaho, firefighters battled blazes that have burned more than
60,000 acres. Fires continued out of control in the Payette, Nez
Perce, Boise, Challis, Clearwater, Salmon, Caribou and Idaho
Panhandle national forests and in the Selway-Bitterroot and Frank
Church River Of No Return wilderness areas.
   With the wind blowing back toward Clover Mist, a crew of 19
``hot shots'' paraded through the timber Sunday dropping a flaming
mixture of diesel fuel and gasoline at their feet.
   ``Hey, we're having fun now,'' one said as he followed the
carefully orchestrated routes.
   Flames danced 100 feet into the smoke and bright red fire raced
through the dry timber, creating a ferocious roar. Heat became so
intense in some spots that the hot shots had to shield their faces.
   ``We have quite a safety plan and there's not much risk,'' said
Bill Miller, chief of the crew spreading the fire, the Bitter Root
Hot Shots of Montana. ``We're not into getting anyone burned up.''
   Seven bulldozers cleared a 6-mile, 70-foot-wide ``freeway''
through the pines Saturday and Sunday to provide a clear barrier to
keep the man-made fire contained. Hand crews cleared out brush and
timber. Then, about 200 firefighters stood guard at the line, armed
with hoses fed by hottub-sized water holding tanks. They watched
for hot spots and flying embers.
   The forest service, eager for its first victory against the
fire, had set the backfire for noon but had to wait until late
afternoon for proper weather conditions. Helicopters and airplanes
loaded with water and fire retardant stood by in case the wind
shifted and blew flames back at the firefighters.
   ``This is the moment we've been waiting for,'' Kaunert said.
``If the fire gets over (Highway) 212, we'd be in a very bad
position to defend the towns.''
   For more than a week, smoke and flames climbing over the
mountains that protect Cooke City had troubled residents, who were
told Friday to prepare for an evacuation that was never necessary.
Three Crandall-area ranches were evacuated Saturday.
   The forest service also was anxious to complete the back burn
during the weekend because flames had jumped a ridge protecting the
towns, and a new weather front, with the potential for gusty,
shifting winds, was expected by Tuesday.
   The back burn showed the progess firefighters have made against
blazes during the weekend throughout Yellowstone, where 450,000
acres have burned. Calm, favorable winds, cool night temperatures
and even morning frost helped slow the march of the flames.
   Since early July the combination of mountaneous terrain and
erratic winds in Yellowstone, which borders the Shoshone forest,
gave Clover Mist the upper hand and forced firefighters to the
defensive. Until Sunday, crews had been unable to mount a massive
assault against Clover Mist.
   ``We had to wait until it got to where we could get at it,''
Kaunert said. ``This fire has kicked us for months. Now we're going
to kick it back.''
   In addition to the towns, the fire also threatened some of the
most productive timber land in the Clarks Fork Ranger District.
   Enough timber is harvested annually out of the threatened area
to build 100 homes, Forest Service District Ranger Randy Herzberg
said
   ``It's very valuable timber as far as the local economy goes,''
he said.

<HEAD>Mountain Residents Take Issue With Laws On Sale Of Bear Parts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gerald ``Jinks'' Parker just can't
understand how he could be facing a $5,000 fine and five years in
prison on charges of selling parts of the black bears he killed
legally.
   ``I'm selling m'guns,'' said Parker, 37. ``I'm selling m'dogs. I
just can't afford it no more. ... This just don't make no sense.''
   Parker, whose ancestors were Cherokee Indians, lives on the
Cherokee Indian Reservation, at the edge of the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park.
   All animals in the park, including wild boar, birds and bears,
are protected from hunting.
   Parker and 34 others were arrested on federal charges of killing
or selling black bear in North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia,
culminating a three-year undercover investigation of poaching in
the Appalachians.
   Some of those arrested are charged with shooting bears in the
Smoky Mountains Park. Some are charged with hunting outside of the
annual six-week season. Still others, like Parker, were charged not
with an illegal kill but violating a law that prohibits the sale of
any part of a black bear, even one killed legally.
   That puzzles Parker.
   ``If I shoot a bear, should I just let it rot in the woods?''
Parker asked. ``Why can't I just sell it to feed my dogs, pay for
gas?''
   Parker and others with deep roots in the Appalachians have often
found themselves at odds with those who protect wildlife over an
act that is second nature to them: hunting.
   Independent mountain folk often distrust central authority,
especially when laws conflict with family and community traditions,
said Curtis W. Wood, a history professor at Western Carolina
University in Cullowhee.
   ``With some of them, I don't think you can talk of this as a
general disregard'' for the law, Wood said. ``For some, it is
honest disagreement.''
   Thomas L. Bennett, a special agent with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, rode with a federal marshal in the unsuccessful
search for Parker, who surrendered the next day.
   ``It's a passion for these people,'' Bennett said. ``It's a
macho thing, too. Many of these guys like the thrill of killing
something, anything. And, because their family did it on the land
before them, it's their right, too.''
   The black bear, the smallest in the bear family, typically is 5
feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Its head and feet make for
startling trophies; its hide can be used as a rug or wall-hanging;
claws can become part of a necklace.
   Bear meat is a staple for many mountain residents and can bring
a couple of dollars a pound. But in recent years, it is the bear's
gall bladder that has proved the most lucrative enticement for
killing the animal.
   On the Oriental market, powdered bear bladder can bring $540 an
ounce or more. The powder, diluted with liquor, is believed to make
an aphrodisiac.
   Bennett said that following last week's poacher roundup he has
gotten calls from people who wanted to surrender rather than risk
arrest.
   ``We'll never stop it completely,'' he said. ``But we can put a
dent in it.''

<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians called for a ban on
air shows after three Italian air force jets collided during a
flying spectacle, one of them slamming into a crowd in a fireball.
More than 40 people were killed.
   At least several dozen of the roughly 500 people injured in
Sunday's disaster at the Ramstein U.S. Air Base were in critical
condition today, West German news reports said.
   It appeared to be the world's worst air show tragedy involving
spectators.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz canceled an air show by West
German warplanes planned for September and asked the country's NATO
partners to consider abandoning similar demonstrations.
   More than 300,000 people, most of them Americans and West
Germans, were watching as the Italian precision team's 10 jets,
flying about 60 yards off the ground, intersected over the field.
   Two planes plunged to the ground and the third veered
uncontrollably out of formation, flames spewing from its fuselage,
headed into the crowd and became an inferno 100 feet high and
equally as wide.
   Terrified spectators ran for their lives as the flames scorched
scores of people and destroyed buses, trucks and cars.
   A young woman who was slightly injured said she just barely
escaped with her life.
   ``My only thought was where can I go, how can I get out of this
alive,'' the unidentified woman told the ZDF television network.
``I saw an opening among the masses of people and ran ... I stood
there for an hour crying.''
   ``There are many children among the dead and injured,'' said
Kris Kumpf, a medical assistant who treated some of the victims.
``And the worst part of it is, we're still trying to find some of
the parents.''
   Sunday's accident was the latest in a series of military crashes
in West Germany this year and had some federal and local officials
demanding an end to air shows.
   ``The events at Ramstein confirm in a really horrible way how
dangerous such spectacles are even for civilian observers,'' said
Walter Kolbow, a federal lawmaker for the opposition Social
Democratic Party.
   ``These air shows must be stopped once and for all,'' said
Friedel Laepple, interior minister for Saarland state.
   AFN, the U.S. military radio network, reported today that at
least 46 people were killed in Sunday's disaster at the base 60
miles southwest of Frankfurt. But Sgt. Eddie Lee, a Ramstein
spokesman, said 41 people were confirmed dead.
   He said bodies were still being identified and he did not know
when a casualty list would be available.
   On its final news broadcast Sunday night, ZDF said 500 people
were injured and 230 remained hospitalized, many with severe burns.
   Following the disaster, the U.S. military set up special
telephones that Ramstein service members could use to call home in
the states.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said it was the worst air show
disaster in terms of spectator deaths. Thirty people died when a
DeHaviland jet crashed into a crowd in 1952 at Farnborough,
England, the BBC said. Forty-six people, most of them U.S. Army
parachutists, were killed in a helicopter crash at a 1982 air show
in Mannheim.
   Hans-Juergen Vollmer, spokesman for the Kaiserslautern
administrative area that includes Ramstein, said he believed the
accident was caused by pilot error. He did not elaborate.
   The Italian MB 339A plowed into a row of cars and buses. The
second jet crashed into a wooded area and the third onto a Ramstein
runway, Air Force officials said. All three pilots were killed.
   The three jets were part of a 10-plane Italian air force
demonstration team, ``Frecce Tricolori,'' which means Tri-Color
Arrows and refers to the three-colored Italian flag.
   The Ramstein air show has drawn protests for several years
because of possible dangers to civilians. Demonstrators had
protested outside the base's gates as Sunday's air show began.
   The Passau Neue Presse newspaper today suggested the disaster
could sour West Germans' attitudes toward NATO forces in their
country.
   ``Pictures like those resulting from the Ramstein tragedy will
not strengthen the views of the citizens in important areas of
defense preparations,'' the newspaper said in a commentary.
   Several groups, including the environmentalist Greens Party,
oppose military air shows because of the potential for such
accidents.
   At least seven aircraft accidents have occurred involving NATO
equipment this year in West Germany. One occurred at a Hanover air
show on May 7, when a British military Chinook helicopter's rotor
blades struck a loading ramp. Two British airmen were killed and 12
spectators injured.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bonn issued a statement offering condolences
to the victims of Sunday's disaster:
   ``We feel great compassion for the Italian team, the Americans,
and the Germans that were involved in today's tragic event. Our
hearts go out to the families and friends of those involved in this
catastrophe.''

   Hundreds of people jammed cliffs
overlooking the beach today when a 46-foot Southern Right whale
swam into historic Botany Bay, apparently to give birth.
   The rare sight caused swimmers, surfboard riders and divers to
get a closer look.
   Wildlife officers placed a 200-yard restriction zone around the
83-ton animal, fearing the activity would antgonize it.
   ``She has been very tolerant, gentle and caring but she ...
could be feeling sensitive, particularly if she's about to calve,''
said a spokeswoman for the National Parks and Wildlife Service.
   The whale was first sighted off the eastern coast a week ago.
Officials said it was probably part of a herd migrating from
Antarctica.
   Botany Bay, named for its profusion of flora, was the first
landing of famed British navigator Capt. James Cook, who was
credited with discovering Australia in 1770.

   The dollar gained sharply in Tokyo today, while
stocks continued their losses of last week with a substantial drop.
   The dollar opened at 133.90 yen, then rose further to close at
134.20 yen, up 0.70 yen from Friday's close of 133.50. It ranged
between 133.90 yen and 134.25 yen, with spot trading estimated at
$3.8 billion.
   Exchange dealers attributed the dollar's strong performance to
loss-cutting.
   ``Orders concentrated in Tokyo because other major markets were
closed today,'' said a dealer at a U.S. bank's Tokyo office,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Those who had sold the dollar
at around 133.80 yen bought it back above the 134-yen level today.
That caused the dollar to gain sharply.''
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which lost a total of 450.45 points last week,
declined another 299.81 points, or 1.08 percent, closing at
27,379.10.
   Despite a strong opening, stock prices declined throughout the
day in thin trading.
   ``There are not too many negative factors in the market, but
there are not many good factors, either,'' said a dealer at a major
securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``As a result,
most investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude.''
   Volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 430
million shares.

   Navy divers searched for three missing sailors
today after rescuing 21 from the wreckage of a Peruvian navy
submarine that sank to the ocean floor after being rammed by a
Japanese tuna boat.
   Officials said the captain of the Pacocha died while trying to
save his men as the submarine sank Friday evening about three miles
off the port of Callao, eight miles west of Lima.
   Three other crew members died and three were missing and
presumed dead, the navy said. The missing men were believed to be
inside water-filled compartments of the submarine, 100 feet below
the surface.
   On Saturday, rescuers used a diving bell to remove 21 sailors
who had been trapped inside the vessel. Another 24 sailors were
rescued Friday night.
   Defense Minister Enrique Lopez said the owners of the 412-ton
Japanese fishing boat that struck the submarine could be fined. The
navy said the No. 8 Kyowa-Maru accidentally struck the submarine in
the stern.
   President Alan Garcia said a ``bad maneuver'' by the boat caused
the collision.
   There were no injuries among the 21 crewmen of the Japanese
boat, which suffered cracks in its steel hull, the Japanese Embassy
said.
   Garcia praised the ``heroic valor of the officers'' aboard the
Pacocha, saying the captain and others died attempting to save
their fellow crewmen.
   ``He gave precise orders to his crew, closed the hatch and
stayed on the bridge, dying in the subsequent sinking,'' Lopez said
following the funeral Sunday of the 37-year-old sailor.
   The trapped sailors communicated with rescuers through sensors
attached by divers to the craft's hull, navy spokesman Luis Castro
said. Officials said rescuers used a diving bell to pull the men to
safety Saturday.
   The collision occurred as the Pacocha was entering the port and
the tuna boat departing, Castro said.
   The Pacocha, purchased in 1974 from the United States, is one of
12 submarines in Peru's fleet, one of the largest in the Americas.
   The 1,870-ton craft, formerly the U.S.S. Atule, was commissioned
on June, 21, 1944, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.

<DATELINE>EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military's bomb squad is
nearly doubling as the United States tries to respond to world
terrorism, a Navy officer says.
   The Navy recently opened a new $18.6 million training center at
this base in the Florida Panhandle with the intent of graduating a
new crop of explosive ordnance demolition technicians.
   The move was needed partially because of ``the growing threat of
international terrorism,'' said Lt. Cmdr. H.F. Mixter, the officer
in charge.
   Other factors he cited during a recent interview was that ``the
world's weaponry is far more sophisticated than it used to be,''
and changes in battlefield strategies.
   But he declined to get any more specific, saying that
information was classified.
   Teaching the new batch of bomb experts can have its
difficulties, he said.
   ``One of the biggest challenges we have as instructors is that
kids don't fix their bicycles any more,'' Mixter said. ``They'd
rather play with their video games.''
   Indeed, besides learning how to work in hazardous environments
such as battlefields contaminated by chemical or nuclear weaponry,
students are introduced to the use of such simple items as wrenches
and screwdrivers.
   The Eglin school, one of only two of its kind in the U.S.
military, trains Army, Air Force, Marine and some foreign military
students, as well as Navy personnel.
   Defense officials began planning for additional training and the
school three years ago when a survey showed an 89 percent increase
in explosives ordnance demolition technicians would be required by
the four services between 1985 and 1990, Mixter said.
   The school was built at Eglin, the West's largest air base at
724 square miles, because it had enough space to accommodate the
school. That space allows for test ranges where explosives can be
set off. And the region's normally temperate weather permits
year-round outdoor activity.
   Another factor is that of the few bases meeting those criteria,
it is the closest to the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal School
at Indian Head, Md., the military's only other center for
bomb-squad training.
   The new school has a staff of 23 officers and 160 enlisted
personnel. About 45 officers and 280 enlisted people are in
training at any given time; approximately 20 percent are women.
About 1,200 students are expected to graduate each year.
   Mixter said the common training for all branches, relatively
rare in the U.S. military, pays off when explosive ordnance
demolition technicians from different services work together in the
field.
   ``Regardless of the service, you know that he knows what you
know,'' Mixter said.
   Students here get a basic 11-week course. They then either go
into the field or fleet as explosive ordnance demolition assistants
or to Indian Head for more training.
   Students are taught to locate explosive devices including
unexploded bombs that have burrowed into the ground and identify
them according to type, function and national origin.
   Students get an opportunity to try out techniques for disposing
of weapons by setting off explosives at the test sites.
   ``We are not heroes, we are technicians,'' Mixter said. ``The
purpose of the drill is to remove the hazards with the least
possible damage, including loss of life. ... When they leave here
we want them to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.''

<HEAD>Soviet-Afghan Space Flight Blasts Off</HEAD>

   A rocket carrying two Soviets and the first Afghan
in space blasted off from a Central Asian space center today to
join cosmonauts seeking an endurance record aboard the orbiting
Soviet space station Mir.
   A Proton rocket carrying pilot Vladimir Lyakhov, Dr. Valery
Polyakov and Afghan military pilot Abdul Ahad Mohmand aboard a
Soyuz TM-6 capsule blasted off from the Baikonur space center on
schedule.
   Officials said Polyakov would monitor the health of two
cosmonauts who have been aboard Mir since December.
   Soviet television provided a live broadcast of the white rocket
riding a long orange flame into the clear sky, and cut away as the
rocket disappeared.
   The official Tass news agency said the Soyuz capsule had reached
orbit, that the flight was proceding normally and that the
cosmonauts felt fine.
   The crew is scheduled to dock Wednesday with the Mir complex.
   Mohmand, 29, was to take part in efforts to identify oil, gas
and other mineral deposits in Afghanistan as well as predicting
runoff of snow and glaciers to alleviate a water shortage.
   He also was to help try to identify where earthquakes might
occur in Afghanistan.
   The mission was an ideal way for the Kremlin to reassure
Afghanistan of support and friendship as it pulls its military
force out of the country.
   The Afghan government of President Najib is locked in a long war
with anti-Marxist insurgents and increasingly is being left to
fight on its own as the 100,000 Soviet soldiers withdraw.
   Under an agreement signed in April in Geneva, the Soviet Union
withdrew half the force between May 15 and Aug. 15 and the
remainder must be withdrawn by Feb. 15, 1989. Soviet forces
intervened in December 1979.
   ``Being a son of my proud people I will carry along not only joy
but also sorrow for my homeland gripped by a fratricidal war,''
Mohmand said in a statement broadcast from the capsule before
liftoff.
   ``Brothers, stop the war and direct your forces toward building
a durable national peace,'' he said.
   Lyakhov, the 47-year-old pilot, was making his third space
flight. He was in space for 175 days in 1979 and a member of a
150-day mission in 1983.
   Polyakov, 46, was sent to check on the health of cosmonauts
Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov, who have been in space since Dec.
21, and are scheduled to remain at the Mir complex until this
December.
   Polyakov will remain at the space station for an unspecified
period after Lyakhov and Mohmand end their eight-day mission,
officials said. Polyakov also will supervise experiments on the
effects of space travel on the human body.
   Titov and Manarov replaced a crew that included Yuri Romanenko,
who now holds the space endurance record of 326 days.
   Space officials say the endurance tests are a step toward
determining the feasibility of a manned flight to Mars, which they
estimate would take three years.
   Replacements for Titov, 40, and Manarov, 37, will be sent aloft
in a monthlong Soviet-French mission in November.
   The Afghan-Soviet mission is the second of three international
flights scheduled this year in the Soviet manned space program.
   The U.S. manned program has been grounded since the January 1986
explosion of the shuttle Challenger, though the shuttle Discovery
is scheduled to be launched in late September of early October.
   A Bulgarian cosmonaut and two Soviet colleagues returned to
Earth June 17 after a 10-day flight that included a linkup with Mir.

   Milton Sperling, whose 50-year
career as a screenwriter and producer included an Oscar nomination
for ``The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell,'' has died following a
long illness. He was 76.
   Sperling died at his home Friday and a funeral was planned today
at Mount Sinai Chapel in the Hollywood Hills.
   A founding member of the Writers Guild of America, Sperling was
nominated for a screenwriting Academy Award in 1955 for ``The
Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell.''
   Some of his other films included ``South of St. Louis'' in 1949;
``The Enforcer'' and ``Distant Drums'' in 1951; ``Marjorie
Morningstar'' in 1958; ``The Bramble Bush'' in 1960; ``Battle of
the Bulge'' in 1965 and ``Captain Apache'' in 1971.
   Sperling, a native of New York City, started his career as a
messenger boy and shipping clerk at Paramount's studios in Long
Island City. He moved to Hollywood, where he worked as a secretary
to film czars Darryl F. Zanuck and Hal B. Wallis at 20th Century
Fox.
   He became an associate producer for Edward Small before turning
to screenwriting with the movie ``Sing Baby Sing'' in 1936. He
followed that with ``Sun Valley Serenade'' in 1941.
   Sperling served as a captain in the Marine Corps during World
War II, teaching documentary filmmaking during combat to a special
team assigned to the Pacific Theater.
   After the war, Sperling returned to Hollywood and formed an
independent production company, United States Pictures.
   Survivors include his wife, Marget, three daughters and a son.

   Surging flood waters have stranded 4
million people and inundated thousands of homes, newspapers
reported today. Officials said flood waters also washed away a
major ferry terminal.
   News reports today said 35 people died in the flooding Sunday,
raising the death toll to 406 since it began in late June.
   The destruction of the ferry terminal at Aricha, near Dhaka,
snapped the capital's main waterway link to 19 flood-ravaged
districts, officials at the Communication Ministry said.
   ``Even if we have ferry boats, where do we take millions of
marooned people?'' an official in the Rajbari district said by
telephone, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   There was no official report on Sunday's casulties. The
government has said only 128 people have died in the floods.
   But officials in Dhaka said today that four of the 19 affected
districts _ Sirajgang, Rajbari, Tangail and Faridpur _ were
virtually under water. Thousands of residents were fleeing for
safer shelter, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.
   ``The situation is going to be worse than in 1987,'' said one
official. Last year's floods claimed at least 1,500 lives and
destroyed 2 million tons of grains, forcing Bangladesh, one of the
world's poorest nations, to import 3 million tons of rice.
   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad held a special Cabinet meeting
Sunday to review the situation in this country of 105 million
people.
   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center predicted today that
rivers would continue to rise and reach a ``critical situation'' by
mid-week.
   Heavy rains and flooding are routine during summer monsoon in
Bangladesh, where rivers shred the country into ribbons of fields
between mighty streams.
   Independent newspaper, The New Nation, on Monday reported 35
deaths from the 19 affected districts. The newspaper said most of
the deaths occurred when houses made of mud and straw collapsed or
were washed away by surging water.
   The newspaper said thousands of houses have been washed away
during the past two weeks.
   Government-owned daily, Dainik Bangla, said more than four
million people were stranded in the area and unable to get out. The
paper said some residents have taken shelter in trees or on the
roofs of government buildings.
   Food was scarce and there were fears of an epidemic because
clean drinking water is not available, the paper said.
   There are not enough ferries to rescue the people.
   In Dhaka, some streets in the old district where drainage is
poor, were under water today. In some places, residents used boats
to make their way through winding lanes.
   Bangladesh has 64 districts.

<HEAD>Escape Artist Thrown From Plane In Coffin, Safely Parachutes To
Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANDWICH, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Houdini-style escape artist was thrown
from an airplane in a locked coffin-like box and said he was
``confident all the way'' while escaping handcuffs and chains and
parachuting to safety.
   ``It was fantastic,'' said Anthony Martin, 22, a professional
escape artist from Sheboygan, Wis., after Sunday's stunt. ``Most
people thought I was going to die on this one ... but the whole
thing went picture perfect.''
   Martin performed the feat before about 500 people who watched at
Skydive Sandwich, a parachuting center in southern De Kalb County
directed by champion skydiver Roger Nelson.
   ``It all went as planned, and I'm very glad because I certainly
wouldn't have wanted to have been part of a disaster,'' said
Nelson, who accompanied the box out of the plane along with an
assistant to stabilize it.
   ``We were just trying to keep the box from tumbling like crazy
and knocking him out,'' Nelson said. ``I wouldn't do it myself. ...
   ``I told him yesterday that he could be killed.''
   Martin wore a parachute and an altimeter to measure the altitude
when he was placed in the 2-by-2-by-6-foot wooden freight box
painted bright yellow.
   A neck noose of padlocked chains was attached to a ring at the
top of the box, and his hands were chained to the sides by two
pairs of handcuffs.
   The box was closed with a jail cell-type lock and loaded onto
the twin-engine, turbo-prop jet.
   The box was pushed out at 13,500 feet, and at 7,500 feet, Martin
jumped clear and parachuted as planned onto a field belonging to
farmer Howard Gast, about 10 miles from the skydiving center.
   ``I was pretty sure he'd make it, but I was nervous when he
didn't come out quickly,'' said Gast, who watched through field
glasses. ``I guess he's trying to prove he's the second Houdini,
and it was a pretty good stunt.''
   Nelson said he had nervous moments when Martin had not emerged
from the box after falling almost halfway to the ground: ``We were
starting to wonder what was going on. But then he suddenly freed
himself.''
   But Martin said that during the 25 to 30 seconds it took to free
himself, he was ``confident all the way,'' and didn't have time to
think about anything except getting out.
   ``I expected to get banged around and almost killed, but the box
fell very stable ... and I figured that I was all right.''
   Martin said he conceived the idea about a year ago because he
wanted to do ``the best and hardest escape ever done.''
   He spent about three months practicing getting out of the
coffin, and a week in July learning how to skydive with Nelson.
   Martin said he has escaped from coffins lowered into rivers,
electrically charged boxes, jails and bank vaults. He declined to
explain how he freed himself Sunday, saying it would force him to
reveal trade secrets learned since he first began doing escapes at
age 10.

<HEAD>Emmy Winners Bite Back at the Networks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backstage at the Emmys is usually a
celebration of broad smiles and victory slaps. This year's awards
were a little different: Some award winners were disappointed.
   Several winners took advantage of the media attention to speak
out candidly on what bothered them about television.
   Richard Kiley, winner for best actor in a drama series for ``A
Year in the Life,'' complained during the national Emmy broadcast
and backstage that NBC's cancellation of the show sprang from
``corporate myopia.''
   ``The show had a tremendously loyal following,'' Kiley said
backstage. ``To not even give it one year...,'' Kiley trailed off,
shaking his head. Kiley also said he was ``amazed'' that the show
itself, widely praised by critics, had not been nominated for best
drama series.
   Kiley said that the experience on ``A Year in the Life'' had
been so disappointing that he ``didn't have it in my plans to do
another (television) series.''
   Gregory Hoblit, an Emmy winner for directing the drama-comedy
hybrid ``Hooperman,'' said today's audiences, spoiled by decades of
cheap laughs on situation comedies, can't appreciate innovation.
   ``I think it's really an exciting form,'' Hoblit said of the
``dramedy.'' ``But I'm not sure the audience knows what it is yet.''
   Two such shows _ ``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' which
was canceled, and ``Frank's Place,'' which is not on CBS' fall
schedule _ have failed to be commercial hits, and Hoblit said that
was a pity. ``We need as much variety as we can possibly get,'' he
said.
   Hugh Wilson, executive producer of ``Frank's Place,'' used the
backstage forum to lobby for his show in CBS' future. Wilson,
winner of an Emmy for his writing on the show, was upset that it
was being kept off the air.
   ``This is a special show. It needs a safe harbor. ... Television
is 90 percent time slot. And I don't have a slot,'' he said.
   Wilson said he was hopeful, though, that ``Frank's Place'' could
be back by January, and that CBS had made such a promise. Time, of
course, will tell.
   Not all of the winners had an ax to grind. Bea Arthur, who
became the last of ``The Golden Girls' '' quartet to win an Emmy,
refused to take any personal satisfaction in her triumph. ``We're
really a group,'' she said.
   Patricia Wettig, recipient of a best supporting actress Emmy for
big winner ``thirtysomething,'' explained the success of the
first-year show by saying, ``It cuts a little quicker to the bone
than most shows.''
   Marshall Herskovitz, the show's co-executive producer, said the
award came unexpectedly.
   ``We really didn't expect to be honored this way,'' he said.
   Winner of the backstage humility prize went to John Larroquette,
who won his fourth consecutive Emmy for supporting actor in a
comedy series. ``It's more a shock this year than any of the
others,'' he said with a straight face. ``Enough already,'' he
added.
   Tony Danza, who accepted a gaggle of Emmy awards for those not
in attendance at the awards show, said he had enjoyed his
``designated acceptor'' role.
   ``Now that I've got to know the Emmy lady so well, I'd like to
take her home,'' he said.

   The little fellow defiantly assumed the
position some 600 years ago.
   Since 1388, Manneken Pis, has been answering nature's longest
call at a Brussels street corner.
   ``Actually, since before then, but we go by 1388,'' says Antoine
Demol, president of the Order of Friends of Manneken Pis.
   Demol is in charge of a two-day celebration starting Sept. 3
with marching bands, Dixieland music, majorettes and folkloric
events in the downtown area where Manneken Pis spouts water, rain
or shine.
   First-time visitors to the ``little man'' are bound to be
disappointed by the figure only slightly more than 21 inches high.
But it is one of the strangest statues anywhere.
   From a raised niche at the corner of Rue de Chene and Rue de
l`Etuve, the Mananeken Pis urinates into a small basin, smiling
tauntingly and leaning slightly backward.
   Few statues can boast a history as that of the Manneken.
``Documents at city hall dating back to 1388 refer to the 30 public
fountains which then provided potable water to the citizens of
Brussels,'' said Demol.
   ``They mention a water pipe feeding `the Manneken Pis''
   In the 14th century such imagery was considered folksy fun.
   Other curious fountains from those days still exist nearby.
``The Three Virgins'' spout water from their breasts. And ``The
Spitter,'' is a man with water cascading from his mouth.
   But who is the Manneken?
   ``His origins are rooted in many legends, some historically more
correct than others,'' said Demol
   One has it that a toddler saved Brussels from a blaze in the
13th centrury by urinating on the lighted fuse of an incendiary
bomb.
   Another legend says an urchin relieved himself against the door
of a sorcerer who condemned the boy to that stance forever.
   Usually, the Manneken is naked. But you may also see him in one
of 447 costumes that have been bestowed on him in the past 300
years.
   The present statue was cast in 1619. For still unknown reasons,
the Elector of Bavaria donated a costume for the boy in 1698.
   ``His second outfit came from King Louis XV of France in 1747 as
an apology for his soldiers who damaged the Manneken,'' said Demol.
   Donating outfits became a custom. So far, 447 have been given by
governments, service clubs and folkloric and trade groups worldwide.
   They show the statue in military finery from many nations or
dressed as Maurice Chevalier, an American football player, a
Shriner, a member of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, a Sioux
Indian or as Elvis Presley.
   ``On Sept. 3, we will give the Manneken his 448th costume, that
of the Order of the Friends of Manneken Pis,'' said Demol.
   Manneken Pis has paid a price for his fame. He has been stolen
least seven times, the last time, in 1978, as a student prank.
   The culprits got off with a warning. One Antoine Lucas was not
so lucky in 1817. He yanked the statue off its base and got 20
years at hard labor.
   Demol's 33-year-old order promotes Manneken Pis as Brussels'
``goodwill ambassador.''
   ``No one ever complains that the statue is obscene,'' he said.
``And, of course, it isn't.
   ``The kid is only five. He cannot be obscene. You must
understand that to the citizens of Brussels, Manneken Pis
symbolizes resistance to fanaticism, simple civil disobedience.''
   A special treat awaits visitors during the two-day festivities
around Manneken Pis.
   ``Several times during those two days,'' said Demol. ``Manneken
Pis will serve wine to passersby in his own peculiar way.''

<HEAD>Mob Trial Jurors Say Panel Misunderstood Judge's Instructions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two jurors in the trial of 20 people who had
been accused of being mobsters say the judge's instructions were
misunderstood and led the panel to mistakenly acquit the defendants
on all charges.
   Helen Bove said she and some other jurors did not say anything
when the verdict was read Friday because they expected federal
prosecutors to ask for a poll of the jury. Polling the jury is a
common practice that can prompt the judge to order further
deliberations or declare a mistrial.
   The jury that heard the 22-month-long U.S. District Court trial
made its decision after 14 hours of deliberations over two days.
The defendants who were accused of being members of the Lucchese
crime family cheered.
   ``Why didn't they poll the jury?'' asked Ms. Bove, of
Wallington. ``There were several of us who voted guilty on some
counts.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney V. Grady O'Malley, the lead prosecutor,
said he did not request a poll because ``at that point it was
apparent to me that they were rejecting the government's case
without even looking at the evidence. It would not have made a
difference.''
   But Ms. Bove said Sunday it would have made a difference.
   According to the jury instructions by Judge Harold A. Ackerman,
the jury was to weigh each of the 77 counts against the defendants
and come to a unanimous decision on each.
   ``Each of your verdicts must be unanimous. It must be 12-0
whether you find each individual guilty or not guilty on each
count. I can accept nothing less than a unanimous verdict,'' the
judge said.
   But Ackerman's instructions also said: ``If you are not
unanimous, as to each essential element of the particular offense,
you must return a verdict of not guilty as to that particular
offense.''
   Ms. Bove said the jury mistakenly took that to mean if jurors
disagreed on the guilt or innocence of defendants on a particular
charge, they were to return an innocent verdict rather than
continue to deliberate until a unanimous decision was reached or
end up with a hung jury.
   ``We all read it and read it and read it and we thought that's
what it was,'' Ms. Bove said. ``In some cases, there wasn't enough
evidence to convict. There were so many counts. But in others there
was.''
   ``We misread the whole thing, said James Tyminski, of Fair Lawn,
referring to the instructions. ``We are laymen. How are we supposed
to understand all of that?''
   The acquittals after one of the longest federal criminal cases
in U.S. history were a monumental blow to the government's fight
against organized crime.
   Ms. Bove also said some jurors, apparently exasperated by the
length of the trial, declined to review evidence during
deliberations.
   ``Some of them said `let's just get it over with','' she said.
   ``I believe that these other jurors didn't do their job right,''
Ms. Bove said. ``Not because they didn't believe what I did but
because they refused to cooperate and do the work necessary.''

<HEAD>Black Contenders Divided Over Black Mayoral Nominating Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the city's three leading black mayoral
contenders were absent from a black-only convention that was
intended to unite the community behind a single candidate but was
considered racist by some.
   Activist Lu Palmer, who helped organize Saturday's event that
drew about 1,000 people, said he considered it an ``insult'' that
Mayor Eugene Sawyer and Alderman Timothy Evans didn't show.
   ``The crowd was held down because Saywer and Evans said they
wouldn't come,'' Palmer said. ``But people are angry that they
didn't have the strength to address their base. Those who didn't
appear hurt themselves.''
   Chicago's third leading black mayoral contender, Alderman Danny
K. Davis, received a standing ovation from those at the Black
People's Convention.
   Delegates are scheduled to poll community groups they represent
and return in two weeks to select a candidate.
   ``I find it very easy to support a black agenda,'' Davis told
the crowd. ``It's not difficult at all, because what's good for
black people in Chicago is good for white people and Hispanic
people.''
   Palmer told the delegates he fears that if all three black
candidates remain in the race it would ``leave the political arena
wide open for a white candidate to become mayor'' in a special
election.
   That would be ``a reversal of what we fought so hard to gain in
these past years,'' he said.
   The election has tentatively been set for 1989, but the Illinois
Supreme Court is considering a challenge seeking to postpone it
until 1991, when the late Harold Washington's term would have
expired.
   Sawyer was elected acting mayor when Washington, the city's
first black mayor, died in November. Sawyer strategists prefer
delaying the election, believing he would benefit from a longer
incumbency.
   Evans, who is delaying announcing his candidacy until the court
rules, said he objected to convention rules that excluded all but
black churches and black community groups.
   ``Too many other elements of the progressive agenda were
excluded,'' he said. ``I want to present my candidacy to all the
city and win not for my race but for what I can do for everyone.''
   Sawyer condemned the convention for not representing the city.
He was in Washington, D.C., on Saturday for the 25th anniversary of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
   John McDermott, chairman of the Committee on Decent, Unbiased
Campaign Tactics, called the convention ``a step backward for
Chicago.''
   ``These actions are deeply divisive and tend to give racial
identity a pre-eminence in our political and civic life which it
does not deserve,'' he said.
   So far, no white Democratic candidate has emerged.
   Ed Howlett, the only announced white candidate, is a Republican.

<HEAD>Rain Widespread; Record Low Temp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain spread across broad sections from the Southwest to New
England today as temperatures dipped to a record low in Kansas.
   The remnants of Tropical Storm Chris pushed heavy rain toward
the East. Chris, which sprang to life from a tropical depression
off Florida, packed its strongest punch when it came ashore Sunday
in South Carolina. It spawned tornados that damaged houses,
destroyed mobile homes and caused at least one death in the
Carolinas before weakening.
   The resulting low pressure system and accompanying rain was
expected togradually merge with a cold front that extended through
the Appalachians.
   Rain and thunderstorms associated with the front in the
Appalachians ranged as far as northern New England, the Ohio and
lower Mississippi valleys and into Texas.
   A moist air mass over the Southwestern produced heavy rain and
thunderstorms in sections of Arizona and California.
   Cool and dry conditions prevailed over the northern and central
Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
   The temperature at Topeka, Kan., dropped to 45 degrees early
today, breaking a record low of 46 set in 1976.
   Warm and mostly dry conditions prevailed across West while
temperatures and humidity were high across the East Coast and Gulf
Coast states.
   Today's forecast called for rain and thunderstorms scattered
from Virginia to New England and from the Carolinas across the Gulf
Coast states, Texas and New Mexico.
   Highs should remain below 80 degrees from New England across the
Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley into the northern and central
Plains. Highs should be in the 90s from south central Texas to
Florida and southern Georgia; 80s to 90s across the western third
of the nation; upper 90s and above 100 degrees in the Southwestern
deserts and interior valleys of California; and in the 70s along
the Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Custer, S.D., to 86 at Blythe, Calif.

   The dollar rose in quiet European trading this

British bank holiday, foreign exchange dealers said. Gold rose
slightly in Zurich.
   ``The market is really dead because London is absent,'' said one

the dollar gained sharply, closing up 0.70 yen at 134.20 yen.
Later, in Europe, it was quoted at 134.25 yen.
   Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's strong
performance in Tokyo to loss-cutting and said orders concentrated
there because other major markets were closed.
   Hong Kong's financial institutions were also closed today for a
national holiday.
   ``Those who had sold the dollar at around 133.80 yen bought it
back above the 134-yen level today,'' said a dealer at a U.S.
bank's Tokyo office. ``That caused the dollar to gain sharply.''
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning, compared with late
Friday's London rates:
   _1.8663 West German marks, up from 1.8565
   _1.5760 Swiss francs, up from 1.5655
   _6.3372 French francs, up from 6.3010
   _2.1077 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0970
   _1,386.25 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50
   _1.2375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23725
   In Europe, the dollar made solid gains against the British
pound. One pound cost $1.6855, compared with $1.7025 in London late
Friday.
   The London bullion markets were closed for the holiday, but in
Zurich the bid price for gold was $432.35, up slightly from $432.00
bid late Friday.

<HEAD>Star Quality Measured IN Arrival Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Star quality was measured by arrival
time at the 40th annual Emmy Awards. As is always true among the
Hollywood set, the truly chic arrived late.
   Strolling in just 25 minutes before the 5 p.m. show time was
heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson and wife, actress Robin
Givens. Just 5 inutes before, soon-to-be awarded Michael J. Fox
arrived with new wife, actress Tracy Pollan, who played Fox's
girlfriend on the NBC comedy series ``Family Ties.''
   Earlier arrivals included William Shatner (2:45 p.m.) and Ann
Jillian (3:35 p.m.)
   Nominated actors and actresses kept mostly quiet about their
chances in the annual exercises of self-congratulation.
   Most, in fact, said pretty much the same thing.
   ``It's hot, isn't it?'' noted JoBeth Williams, nominated for her
work in the ABC miniseries ``Baby M.''
   ``It's very warm,'' said John Larroquette, later to receive his
fourth-straight Emmy for his ``Night Court'' effort on NBC.
   ``Yeah, it's hot,'' said Fox.
   You get the point.
   The celebrities, and even the hangers-on, were welcomed by
hundreds of fans, some of whom staked out spots across from the
auditorium beginning at 6 a.m. Sunday.
   The crowd, six deep in the withering Pasadena weather, greeted
the stars arriving in limousines with shrill squeals of delight,
while those stepping from a Volkswagen or Honda went largely
unnoticed.
   One of the more unusual twists in the arrival pandemonium was
the entrance of ``Entertainment Tonight'' reporter Leeza Gibbons.
   As she stepped out of her limousine, Miss Gibbons was met with a
barrage of shrieks from fans. She then posed for photographers
lining the steps. When she was done with the limelight, Miss
Gibbons went to work, climbing into the press area to conduct
interviews.
   Like the Academy Awards, the Emmys traditionally attract some of
the more elaborate outfits in Hollywood. Winner for the most
outrageous get-up this year went to Jean Kasem, actress wife of
TV-radio personality Casey Kasem. She wore an unusual low-cut,
lavender dress and a matching turban-like headwrap. Her husband,
not to detract, wore a simple black tuxedo.
   Diane Brill, who no one seemed to recognize from any television
show, nevertheless turned many heads with a dress of see-through
mesh placed in a number of strategic places, most below the waist.
   Tyson dressed down for the event _ he was unable to wear his
tuxedo coat because of the large cast on his right hand. The boxer,
who broke his hand last week in a Harlem altercation with a former
opponent, did at least put a fresh, gleaming white plaster wrap on
the cast.
   Two signs competed for the camera's eye. One praised ``Cagney &
Lacey'' co-stars Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly (who did win
outstanding actress in a drama series) and the other said simply:
``Fear God.''

   For a moment, the air show crowd
of 300,000 stood hushed as an Italian military jet veered and
tumbled into their midst.
   ``There was this incredible silence,'' Air Force Staff Sgt. John
Flanagan was quoted as saying. ``It was like the crowd was in
shock. Then there was a second muffled explosion and more fire, and
that's when people started running, screaming.
   ``I saw this little boy ... his hair was all singed and the skin
was coming off his face,'' Flanagan told the unofficial U.S.
military newspaper Stars and Stripes. ``Nobody stopped to help him.
They were running. We stopped the police and the police picked him
up.''
   At least 40 people were killed and hundreds injured as three
Italian jets crashed at Ramstein U.S. Air Base on Sunday. One
exploded in a fireball amid the crowd, burning scores of people.
   ``Some were missing skin on their arms,'' said Stars and Stripes
reporter DeeDee Arrington Doke, also an witness. ``A lot had black
burns, like their skin was burned black.''
   She said that after the crash ``people started crying and
screaming. The ones who were stopped were hugging each other and
crying like they were saying `What are we going to do?' The ones
who were running were screaming.''
   The 10-plane Italian precision flying team had intersected about
60 yards above the ground, when two planes plunged to the ground
and the third veered into the crowd.
   Jim Beichler, a University of Maryland instructor, told the
Stars and Stripes that when the planes collided, ``there was a
silence.
   ``The plane blew up, and people started running. One guy was on
fire. other people were wrapped up in barbed wire. There were small
fires all around me,'' he said.
   Witnesses described a sunny Sunday that turned into a blackened
scene of panic and suffering.
   ``I saw the fire ball and then the noise hit me,'' American
witness Barry Miller told the AFN U.S. military radio network. ``It
sounded like somebody running into an aluminum garage or
something.''
   The Italian Aermacchi MB 339A plowed into a row of cars and
buses, bursting into a ball of flames at least 100 feet high and
wide.
   ``We saw the fireball racing toward us, so we first threw
ourselves down on the ground,'' said Detlef Hosser, a ncameraman
for the ARD television network.
   A young woman who was slightly injured said she just barely
escaped with her life.
   ``I heard the jets colliding, it was a terrible crash. My only
thought was where can I go, how can I get out of this alive,'' the
unidentified woman told the ZDF television network.
   ``I saw an opening among the masses of people and ran in that
direction and made it. I stood there for an hour crying,'' she said.
   Scores of people were burned. Many children were among the dead,
said Kris Kumpf, a young medical assistant who treated some of the
victims.
   ``And the worst part of it is, we're still trying to find some
of the parents,'' she said, trembling and sobbing at a nearby inn.
   She joined others phoning relatives at the inn, assuring her
mother she was fine, ``but there are too many dead.''
   ``People came in here with their clothes torn and their arms
bleeding, just to call home to say they were safe,'' said Walter
Schlenz, who owns the inn in this town 60 miles southwest of
Frankfurt.
   An elderly West German man at the inn said the accident occurred
when two groups of Italian jets were performing a maneuver just
above the airfield.
   ``Five of the planes came from one direction, and four came head
on in another. A single plane came from yet another direction, and
there was a crash.
   ``All I saw was a big ball of fire,'' said the man, who would
not give his name.
   Hours after the crash, the airfield was scattered with paper
cups, beer cases, and turned-over lawn chairs left by fleeing
spectators.
   A smoky stench still clotted the air.

<HEAD>San Diego Zoo Mourns Loss of Oldest Elephant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON L. JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zookeepers and elephants are mourning the death
of the San Diego Zoo's oldest and most popular elephant, a
10,000-pound matriarch that led the herd for 47 years and
entertained millions of tourists.
   The 51-year-old Asian elephant, named Lucki, was put to sleep
Sunday because her health had deteriorated to where she could no
longer stand, even with the help of a forklift, said spokesman Jeff
Jouett.
   ``She was one of most popular and best-loved animals at the
zoo,'' said Jouett, who estimated that 102 million tourists had
seen her over the years.
   Lucki, who came to San Diego in 1941 from a zoo in Calcutta,
India, was the zoo's biggest and most dominant elephant. She stood
9 feet at the shoulder.
   ``It's a major passage in the zoo elephant herd when the
matriarch dies,'' Jouett said. ``The current elephant keepers love
her dearly and are stunned by her loss. ... It's a subdued day at
the zoo.''
   About 10 years ago, Lucki started suffering from chronic tooth
and foot ailments, Jouett said.
   In 1981, Lucki became the first captive elephant to have a tooth
pulled. Keepers regularly trimmed her foot pads to lessen her
problems, which were caused by lack of exercise.
   But during the past week, her condition worsened because of an
infection in her front feet. Sunday morning Lucki was unable to
stand.
   ``The veterinarian believes she reputured the muscles in (her)
back legs while trying to push herself up,'' Jouett said. ``They
tried coaxing her up. They brought in a forklift with a crane
attached. There was no way she could move.''
   After consulting with elephant keepers and curator of mammals
Rick Barongi, veterinarian Don Janssen injected the fatal shot of a
drug, the spokesman said.
   Among the witnesses were the zoo's director, Doug Myers, who
came in on his day off, and eight former or present elephant
keepers. The zoo's five other elephants were brought in later.
   ``Elephants are very intelligent and they can understand why one
of their own is no longer with them,'' Jouett said. ``They do a
very similar thing in the wild, so Maya and other elephants got an
hour to pay last respects.''
   Maya is a 49-year-old Asian elephant that came from India with
Lucki and was her best friend, he said.
   As matriarch, Lucki was always the first in the herd to eat and
enter the yard from the barn, Jouett said. She also was responsible
for disciplining members of the herd, as well as defending it from
intruders.
   Asian elephants have lived to nearly age 70 in captivity, but
are believed to have shorter life spans in the wild, Jouett said.
Lucki's body was transported to the zoo's hospital for a necropsy.

<HEAD>`Tap-O-Mania' Draws Record Crowd to Dance Near Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It was an off-Broadway production with a cast of
4,497 hoping, make that hopping, to dance their way into the record
books in the 10th annual Tap-O-Mania extravaganza.
   The tap-dancers, from as far away as India, Japan, Italy, the
Netherlands, West Germany and Israel, gathered Sunday outside
Macy's department store to get into the Guinness Book of World
Records for the largest assemblage of tap-dancers.
   Dancing to ``There's No Business Like Show Business,'' the
hoofers broke the record of 4,000 set in Glasgow, Scotland, last
year. Macy's held the record before that with a gathering of 3,783
tap-dancers in 1986.
   ``We're going to put them in their place real quick,'' said Jean
McFaddin, a Macy's executive and one of the organizers, as the
dancers lined up.
   ``I've always wanted to be on Broadway and this is the closest
I'll ever come,'' said Donna Kestel, of Lake Charles, La.
   The participants ranged in age from 10-day-old Joshua Morgan, of
Brooklyn, in his mother Janice's arms, to 82-year-old Anne Fels, of
Boca Raton, Fla.
   ``It's like a rush. It's the same type of feeling you get when
you watch a marathon. There are all these people really trying and
trying to make history in a special way,'' said Kathy Gargan, 39,
who choreographed the event as the dancers lined up 20-deep from
Seventh Avenue to Broadway.
   The yearly extravaganza stemmed from requests from people to
march in the Thanksgiving Day parade, which is restricted to Macy's
employees and their families, McFaddin said.

   Ku Klux Klan supporters waved Nazi flags and
taunted hundreds of marchers commemorating a speech made by slain
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. during a tense afternoon
that led to 14 arrests.
   About 900 police officers, some on horses and others carrying
clubs, filled Marquette Park on Sunday and separated the KKK rally
from the multiracial group marching to mark the 25th anniversary of
King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech.
   Officers surrounded the marchers _ about 300 blacks, whites and
Hispanics _ as they entered the park from a nearby church. Several
hundred of the white supremacists tried to confront the marchers
but were held back by police.
   ``We have a slogan: `White people united _ white people united
will never be defeated,''' an unidentified Klansman wearing a white
hood told an all-white crowd of about 500 at the rally. Some in the
crowd held Nazi flags and wore ``White Power'' T-shirts.
   ``After 20 years you wouldn't think we'd need all these police
officers out here,'' said Dee D. Smith Simmons, an organizer of the
gathering. ``It shows we still have a lot of work to do.''
   Several times during the Klan rally, police held back crowds of
people chanting slogans such as ``White Power'' who tried to break
away and confront the multiracial gathering.
   ``We wanted to go meet with them people, see what they were
doing,'' said neighborhood resident Lisa Greenlee, 19, who was
wearing a shirt with the ``White Power'' slogan and a swastika.
``We were gonna tell 'em they ain't gonna get our neighborhood.''
   ``It's a white park _ they shouldn't be here,'' said Barry
Kordelewski, 21.
   Rosetta Martin, a white woman from suburban Hazel Crest
attending the King rally, expressed relief that police were present
to protect her and fellow marchers.
   ``I think it's unfortunate,'' the Rev. Martha Scott, an
organizer of the King rally, said of the Klan sympathizers.
``They're God's children and we look forward to the day that
they're on our side.''
   Of the 14 arrests, 12 were for disorderly conduct, one was for
battery and one was for possessing alcohol in the park, said Deputy
Chief J. Corless, who added that he did not know whether the
arrested people were Klan sympathizers or King rally supporters.
   ``They make more arrests than that on a regular Sunday in this
park,'' he said.
   The crowds dispersed by late afternoon.
   In 1966 King led a protest march into Marquette Park, and was
confronted by a crowd of whites throwing stones.

<HEAD>School Closure Extended; Man Shot When Violating Curfew</HEAD>

   Troops shot and critically wounded a West Bank
man who violated a curfew today when he left his house to meet an
ambulance he called for his sick son, hospital officials and Arab
witnesses said.
   Also today, Israeli authorities delayed the start of the school
year for junior high and high school students in the occupied Gaza
Strip, affecting about 100,000 Palestinian youths, an army
spokesman said.
   Police shut down a federation of 108 Palestinian charities
Sunday, accusing it of being a PLO front.
   West Bank military commander Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzneh had ordered
the Federation of Charitable Societies in Jerusalem closed for one
year.
   Ellen El Araj, deputy head of the charity organization, denied
it had political goals and said group projects would be hurt.
   The schools were supposed to open on Sept. 1, but the spokesman
said junior high schools would reopen two weeks late and high
schools on Oct. 1. The students started summer vacation in July. No
date has been set for the reopening of West Bank universities and
schools.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli legislators rejected a motion to shut down
the controversial Ketziot tent prison in the Negev desert and
launch an inquiry into the deaths of two Palestinians during a riot
there earlier this month.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, addressing Parliament during a
fiery half-hour debate, said Israel would not close its prisons
until the Arab uprising ends: ``If you (Palestinians continue with
the violence, the violence will be met by force.''
   Communist Party legislator Charlie Bitton was asked to leave the
hall after he accused Rabin of ``sounding like a Nazi.''
   An army spokeswoman said she was checking the reported shooting
in Nablus. According to officials at east Jerusalem's Mukassed
Hospital, Bilal Shabi, 42, was shot and critically wounded in the
chest.
   Shabi was the fourth Nablus resident to be shot for leaving his
home during the curfew, which was imposed Thursday.
   A neighbor in Nablus said Shabi came to his house to use the
phone early today to call an ambulance for his 10-year-old son,
Kayed, who was suffering a lung infection.
   ``Then he went down to wait for the ambulance, so the driver
wouldn't get lost,'' the neighbor told the Associated Press on
condition of anonymity. Shabi lives in Nablus' old city, a crowded
quarter of narrow, often unmarked alleys.
   On Sunday, Israel permitted a Palestinian activist to return
home after spending three years in voluntary exile in the United
States and Jordan.
   Authorities canceled an expulsion order against Khalil Abu Ziyad
in 1985 in exchange for a promise he would not engage in
anti-Israeli activities or maintain contacts with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Abu Ziyad, who was accused of being a senior activist in a PLO
branch, was freed from jail in 1980 after serving a 10-year term
for terrorist activity.
   Also Sunday, authorities found in the West Bank town of Hebron
the burned and bloodied body of a Palestinian suspected of being an
Israeli collaborator.
   Palestinian sources said the victim collaborated with Israeli
authorities. Police said he was a thief.
   Since the Arab uprising began Dec. 8, 255 Palestinians have been
killed. Four Israelis also have died.

   Strike leaders said thousands of workers
joined a stoppage at a huge southeastern steel mill today when
management tried to reopen it two weeks into Poland's worst labor
unrest since 1981.
   Word of the broadened strike at the Stalowa Wola steel and heavy
machinery plant came a day after Communist authorities said they
might let Solidarity leader Lech Walesa take part in broad-based
reconciliation talks.
   Management had ordered the 18,000-worker plant closed Friday
because of a strike that began a week ago, but allowed workers into
the yard this morning and more than 5,000 joined the roughly 1,000
strikers, said Piotr Niemczyk of the Solidarity Information Center
in Warsaw.
   Phone calls to management at the defense-related plant were not
answered. But state-run Polish radio said seven plant departments
were affected. It accused strikers of ``entering working
departments by force, making operation impossible.''
   On Sunday, Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski endorsed the idea
proposed by authorities of a ``round-table'' discussion with strike
leaders.
   In a speech broadcast to the nation at the end of a two-day
meeting of the communist party's policy-making Central Committee,
he directed his most severe criticism at the party-appointed
government of Prime Minister Zbigniew Messner.
   Gen. Jaruzelski said that by failing to deal with economic and
political tensions, the government had helped precipitate the
strikes that began Aug. 16.
   The general, who heads the communist party, refrained from
directly blaming the Solidarity free trade union movement for the
strike wave and hinted at a government shakeup in the near future.
   Communist party spokesman Jerzy Majka said the government was
prepared for reconciliation talks without any preconditions, but
added that he had no information on when such talks could begin.
   He called Walesa ``one of the possible candidates'' for
participation in such talks, but added that no one could take part
``as a representative of an illegal organization.''
   ``It's up to the other side to make the first move,'' Majka
added.
   In addition to higher wages to offset inflation of nearly 60
percent, the strikers have demanded demand the legalization of
Solidarity, which was banned after being crushed in a 1981 military
crackdown.
   Walesa last held a meeting with high-level communist authorities
in early 1982 before he was released from internment.
   In Gdansk, Walesa rejoined striking workers at the Lenin
shipyard Sunday morning, injuring himself slightly as he hauled
himself over the 7-foot fence after a police officer tried to stop
him, aides said.
   Solidarity estimated today that about 13,500 people were
occupying 10 strikebound workplaces. About 20 enterprises were
idled at the height of the strike wave.
   In the Baltic port of Szczecin, talks between management and
representatives of striking dockers broke off and a management
attempt to hold talks with striking bus employees failed as well,
the state-run news agency PAP reported.
   But in the southwestern city of Jastrzebie, workers at the
Jastrzebie coal mine agreed to end their strike after a meeting
with management, PAP reported. Only the July Manifesto coal mine,
where the labor unrest began two weeks ago, remains on strike in
the Silesian town not far from the Czechoslovak border.
   Police evicted strikers from several workplaces last week, but
there was no use of force to end strikes over the weekend.
   In Gdansk on Sunday, police blocked about 400 people who set off
after a mass at St. Brygida's church from approaching the
strikebound Lenin shipyard a few blocks away. The crowd dispersed
peacefully.
   The latest bid for national reconciliation by Jaruzelski, who
led the 1981 crackdown on Solidarity, appears to leave the decision
on potential discussion partners for the round table up to the
opposition.
   Efforts earlier this summer to draw senior Solidarity advisers
into informal talks with low-ranking party and government officials
on the economic malaise met with only limited success.
   The idea for round-table talks was proposed Friday by Interior
Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, who said they would be to take up
grievances of striking workers after the strikes, as long as they
observed the nation's legal and constitutional order.
   Jaruzelski made no immediate recommendation to shake up
Messner's government, but said party deputies would decide when
Parliament next meets, most likely in September.
   Ending its meeting, the central committee passed a resolution
endorsing continuation of economic and political reform with no
``half-way measures,'' but condemning ``law-breaking and
destruction,'' a reference to strikes.
   On the meeting's opening day, a number of the central
committee's 230 members launched harsh attacks on the government
and their speeches were later televised.
   ``We are not used in the party to criticizing the government
from the rostrum of the central committee. That we have always done
in the family, silently,'' Jaruzelski said. ``Now we are finishing
with that practice.''

<TEXT>
   Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle flew to
Miami to meet with Panamanian opposition leaders in the United
States and plans to return to his country in a week or two, a White
House official said.
   Delvalle has been in hiding since his ouster Feb. 26 by military
ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega but is still recognized as
Panama's chief of state by the United States.
   There were no plans for Delvalle to travel to Washington to meet
with administration or State Department officials, according to the
official who spoke Sunday on condition of anonymity. The official
did not address whether such meetings might be held elsewhere.
   Juan Sosa, Panamanian ambassador to the United States said in a
telephone interview from Washington that the ousted president came
to the United States for a brief, personal visit.
   Sosa would not say whether Delvalle's visit involves efforts to
overthrow Noriega.
   ``He has an agenda,'' Sosa said. ``We're not divulging the
agenda for obvious reasons. President Delvalle is committed to
establishing a democracy in Panama _ that's as far as I will go in
my comment.''
   Sosa plans to meet with Delvalle but would not say whether
Delvalle will meet with Reagan administration officials.
   Delvalle and his wife Marianella arrived at Miami International
Airport Saturday on a military jet, after six months in hiding in
his homeland, with enough luggage to fill the bed of a pickup truck.
   The couple were met by Secret Service agents, who were providing
24-hour protection at an undisclosed South Florida location.
   White House spokesman Bill Harlow, in Santa Barbara, Calif.,
with the vacationing president, called Delvalle's trip a ``private
visit'' that is expected to last a week or two.
   Asked whether Delvalle was seeking asylum or intended to remain
in the United States indefinitely, Harlow said, ``He plans to
return in the not-too-distant future.''
   Delvalle visited Miami in July for a heart checkup. He had heart
by-pass surgery about 10 years ago and is supposed to have a
checkup every six months, but this visit is unrelated to Delvalle's
health, Sosa said.
   After Noriega was indicted in Miami and Tampa on drug
trafficking charges, Delvalle tried to fire the military leader.
But Noriega refused to go and instead had Delvalle replaced with
Manuel Solis Palma.

   Some 2,200 registered nurses from six
hospitals will return to work this week after ending a four-week
strike that at one point involved 4,000 nurses from eight
hospitals, union officials said.
   Of the 1,200 California Nurses Association members who voted
Sunday, 77 percent approved a new contract, which offers a 21
percent wage increase over 34 months. The pact differs little from
one rejected 11 days ago.
   The nurses are set to return to work on Wednesday, said CNA
spokeswoman Maureen Anderson.
   Although 10 other hospitals were unaffected by the walkout,
hundreds of patients were inconvenienced as some of the struck
medical facilities closed emergency rooms, delayed surgeries and
consolidated many other services.
   While many nurses weren't elated with the agreement, they said
they demonstrated labor solidarity.
   ``We've put this message out to the hospitals: That nurses are
serious about the issues facing them and we intend to be listened
to,'' said Mary Scheib, a CNA nurse at Mt. Zion Hospital.
   ``We're going to be continuing our efforts (to improve pay and
working conditions) when we go back to work,'' she added. ``Today
is really day one of organizing for 1991, when the contract
expires.''
   A proposed CNA contract voted down Aug. 19 by a 2-1 margin
offered 20 percent over 36 months. CNA went into the strike Aug. 2
demanding a 21 percent wage increase over two years.
   Karen Henry, chief negotiator for Affiliated Hospitals, the
group representing the affected medical facilities, said Sunday
that the CNA contract ``accomplished the hospitals' bargaining
objectives.'' She defined that mainly as avoiding large pay raises
in a two-year period.
   Under the CNA contract, a dayshift nurse at top scale will make
$21.99 an hour by the end of the contract, or $45,700 annually.
   The 1,700 members of Local 250 of the Hospital and Health Care
Workers Union, who went on strike July 26, began returning to work
Wednesday. They walked out mainly over health benefits.
   CNA's negotiating committee unanimously endorsed the latest
contract.
   The latest proposal was an unsolicited offer submitted Friday to
Affiliated. The two sides had not met at the bargaining table for
nearly a week.
   CNA nurses struck at Children's, Marshal Hale, St. Mary's, St.
Francis and Mount Zion hospitals in San Francisco and Seton Medical
Center in Daly City.
   Local 250 accepted a contract last week that provides up to 6
percent pay raises for nurses and some other hospital workers over
two years. Some other workers will not receive raises, but bonuses
ranging up to $300 by the end of the contract.
   About 100 nurses and service workers remain on strike at French
Hospital, where talks have been held separately. A settlement there
is expected to be routine.

   Four members of the Charlie Daniels Band
narrowly escaped injury when their motor home erupted in flames as
the band returned from playing at the Ventura County Fair, a
spokesman said today.
   All six of the people on board, including band leader Daniels,
fled just before the 40-foot motor home caught fire shortly before
midnight Sunday, said David Corlew, the country band's road manager.
   Four of the five band members had been inside with a couple who
leased the motor home to the band.
   ``It didn't really start blazing until we were all off,'' Corlew
said, adding there's ``never a dull moment'' in life on the road.
   ``Just tell everybody we set them on fire in Ventura,'' Tommy
Crain, the band's lead guitarist, told agent Alan Hopper of the
William Morris Agency.
   Hopper, an agent for the band, had been at the concert with
Steve Ball and the two happened upon the motor home just after it
caught fire. Flames were shooting 30 feet into the air, Hopper said.
   ``We stopped after we saw the thing on fire,'' said Ball, news
editor of the Daily Journal in San Francisco. ``It was really
incredible, this thing was a ball of flames.''
   Passing motorists who spotted smoke coming from the front of the
vehicle flagged the group down about 16 miles south of Ventura on
Highway 101, about 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, Hopper said.
   After they escaped, the band joined Crain and the crew in the
crew bus, which was traveling in front of them with the
instruments, Hopper said.
   ``Charlie was very calm and happy that they were able to
escape,'' Hopper said. ``They headed right on down the road, just
like troupers. They've got more dates to play.''
   ``Charlie just said, `thank God for the motorists,''' who
flagged down the unmarked motor home, Hopper said. ``They had no
idea they were saving Charlie Daniels.''
   The cause of the fire was unknown.

   A golfer was in critical condition
today after being shot twice in the stomach during a robbery on the
16th tee of the course where he plays six times a week.
   Ben Stein, 66, was in Jackson Memorial Hospital's surgical
intensive care unit recovering from Saturday's attack.
   ``You can't even play golf and feel safe,'' said his wife, Jean
Stein, 58.
   The shooting occurred on the southernmost hole on the Bayshore
Golf Course, bordered by trees on one side and a lake on the other.
   While Stein watched his partner tee off, two young men in dark
clothing walked up to him and tried to rob him, police Sgt. James
Mazer said. ``We don't know exactly where they came from,'' he said.
   Stein struggled with one of the robbers before being shot, Mazer
said. His golf partner escaped unharmed. The robbers fled with an
undetermined amount of money.
   Stein plays at the course every day except Monday, said
assistant club pro Chuck Coe.

   A Finnish military training plane
failed to come out of a spin during an air show stunt and crashed,
killing the pilot hours after an air show disaster claimed more
than 40 lives in West Germany.
   The crash Sunday at Kleine Brogel Air Base, 68 miles northeast
of Brussels, was the second such air accident this month in Belgium.
   Witnesses said one of the two Redigo aircraft taking part in the
show organized by the Belgian air force was unable to come out of a
spin during stunt manuevers and plunged to the ground.
   Officials said the pilot, Ari Piippo, was flying too low to
enable him to safely eject from the plane, which belonged to the
state-owned Finnish aircraft maker Valmet. Valmet recently sold 10
Redigo airplanes to Finland's air force for training purposes.
   On Aug. 7, a Belgian pilot died when his Mirage-5 jetfighter
crashed at an air show, also organized by the Belgian air force, at
Leopoldsburg, seven miles west of Kleine Brogel Air Base.

   A clash between blacks and whites in a
racially mixed neighborhood ended with the explosion of a grenade
that wounded seven people, police and witnesses said.
   The explosion capped a melee that erupted Sunday evening between
a group of rock- and bottle-throwing blacks in the parking lot of a
convenience store and a group of club-wielding whites gathered at
an adjacent bar, police said.
   Some residents said racial tension in the Duplex City
neighborhood has increased since the opening of the Midway Bar,
which they said has a clientele of ``bikers'' and ``rednecks.''
   As the confrontation became heated, whites yelled racial slurs,
said witness Lynn Butler. Then, he said, he saw a white man emerge
from the area of the bar and lob a hand grenade.
   ``He just popped the clip. He just threw it. Then in five
seconds there was a boom!'' Butler said, adding that everyone in
the parking lot scrambled for cover.
   ``I saw a grenade flying and it hit the parking lot,'' said
8-year-old Aaron Reinke, adding that he ran into the store. There,
he said, a man told him ```Get down, quick!'''
   Butler also said a white man fleeing the area in a vehicle
brandished an automatic weapon and opened fire, but officers said
they could not confirm that report.
   Manatee County Sheriff's Capt. Al Denison said late Sunday night
that no arrests had been made, but a strong suspect has been
identified.
   Four of the wounded were juveniles, including a 12-year-old.
None of the injuries appeared critical, but one 17-year-old boy was
admitted to Manatee Memorial Hospital for treatment.
   All of the victims, except for a 28-year-old white man, were
black, officials said.
   ``It does not appear to be a strictly racial incident even
though the situation basically is between whites and blacks,''
Sheriff Charlie Wells said. ``It does not appear to be anything
that's brewing over a period of time from what we can find out.''

   NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario (AP) _ Canadian marathoner Vicki
Keith began swimming across Lake Ontario early today in the last
lap of her quest to become the first person to swim all five Great
Lakes.
   The 27-year-old swimming instructor from Kingston, Ontario,
started her five-lake marathon in July in Lake Erie, crossed
sections of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan later that month and
completed a 21-mile arm of Lake Superior on Aug. 15.
   Ms. Keith appeared to be in no hurry to cross Lake Ontario,
saying it would take her about 36 hours to swim 32 miles to the
Canadian National Exhibition grounds in Toronto.
   ``I'm going to walk across the lake instead, guys,'' she joked
to well-wishers gathered at the lakeshore before departing. The
lake was calm with a water temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit
when Ms. Keith set off.
   Last summer, Ms. Keith became the first person to complete a
double crossing of Lake Ontario.
   Her Great Lakes marathon was organized to raise money for a
swimming pool at Variety Village, a Toronto center for disabled
children. She has raised half of her $243,000 goal.

   Moments after they were married, a couple
spotted the groom's car stolen two days earlier, chased it in their
rented limousine, forced the driver to pull over and held two men
until police arrived.
   Johanna and Michael Jones, on the way to their wedding
reception, made the citizen's arrest while dressed in formal bridal
attire.
   ``It was a good omen to have something returned on our wedding
day,'' said Mrs. Jones, 30.
   ``We couldn't believe it,'' Mrs. Jones said in a telephone
interview Saturday. ``Our friend Bill who was driving the limo
said, `Nah, that's not your car.' But I said, `Yes it is, it's got
the dented fender.'
   ``I still had my bouquet in hand and I jumped out in my wedding
gown,'' Mrs. Jones said.
   ``We yelled to people who stopped to see what was going on to
call the police,'' said Mrs. Jones, a technical writer for a
computer company. Her 31-year-old husband is a bank programmer.
   The two men in the car told the Joneses they had bought the
vehicle from somebody else and were unaware it had been stolen,
according to Susan Reed, a friend of the couple.
   The two men were arrested without incident but only the driver,
Roberto Mojica, 22, was booked for investigation of auto theft,
said Officer Phil Schneider.
   Mojica was in custody Sunday and scheduled for arraignment this
week.
   ``I've been doing this for seven years and I've never seen
anything like it,'' said Schneider, 27. ``Their wedding
photographer stopped and took a few snaps but it would have been
funny if they could have gotten a photo of (Mrs. Jones) hitting the
suspects over the head with her flowers.''
   The car, stolen Thursday while the couple was arranging their
wedding ceremony, was released to the Joneses; a friend drove it on
to the reception. The couple left for a Hawaiian honeymoon Sunday.

   Michael Dukakis said today he is
confident he can halt the recent surge of Republican opponent
George Bush, adding ``I know we can do it together.''
   The Democratic nominee kicked off a two-day visit to western
Massachusetts by meeting with local officials here, where he cited
the area's resurgent economy as an example of the public-private
partnership approach he promises to bring to the White House if
elected president.
   ``It's going to be a long, hard competitive race,'' Dukakis told
a breakfast sponsored by the Northern Berkshire Chamber of
Commerce. ``One thing that inspires me every day and every week out
there on the campaign trail ... is that I know we can do it
together, because I've seen it happen.''
   Dukakis also visited an abandoned mill complex being coverted
into a major art museum and the Basketball Hall of Fame, where he
was to deliver an economic development speech.
   The western Massachusetts trip comes as Democratic strategists
within and outside the Dukakis campaign are urging Dukakis to take
a more aggressive stance in response to daily attacks from Bush and
GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle.
   While Dukakis frequently denounces negative campaigning, he
hinted strongly Saturday he was nearing the point where he would
return Bush's salvos, which range from attacks on Dukakis'
patriotism to jokes about his height.
   ``Remember 1982? It's Ed King all over again,'' Dukakis said
Saturday night on a flight home from Washington.
   King defeated Dukakis in 1978 only to lose four years later in a
rematch that was considered one of the nastiest and most aggressive
campaigns in state history.
   ``It's getting the juices out early,'' Dukakis said. ``In 1982,
King was on with negative television on me beginning in February. I
mean non-stop, never got off, every single week, bang, bang, bang
bang.
   ``Did it hurt? Sure it hurt. But at the appropriate point,
people I think had a sense that enough is enough. You come back,
and basically you make the needed adjustments.''
   Since the Democratic convention, with few exceptions, Dukakis
has stressed his message of economic opportunity while facing GOP
attacks on his positions on defense, crime, the Pledge Of
Allegiance and gun control.
   Dukakis, speaking to reporters on the flight, recalled that John
F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson got bogged down with congressional
duties after the 1960 Democratic convention but bounced back to
win, seemingly a reference to the time he is forced to dedicate to
being governor.
   With Bush surging and Labor Day on the horizon, Dukakis plans to
cut his Statehouse time to one day a week and his campaign is
preparing to unleash a round of television advertising, probably
within a week of Labor Day.
   And while Dukakis frequently exhorts Bush to focus on the
issues, he has a history of firing back when he believes he has
come under undue attack.
   In 1982, for example, Dukakis was under harsh attack from King
in the weeks leading up to a televised debate. Before the program
began, Dukakis was asked to check his microphone and rattled off
figures about increasing crime during the King administration. The
move startled King and he floundered through the debate as Dukakis
assailed him for running a corrupt administration. Dukakis, under
attack from Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt during the presidential
primaries, also aired an ad noting Gephardt's ``flip flops'' on a
number of issues.
   While many Democratic Party officials have said the Dukakis
campaign appears to have lost the steam it had coming out of the
Democratic convention, the candidate himself appears undaunted.
   Smiling at the reporters questioning his campaign's recent
efforts, Dukakis said simply, ``It's only August.''

   Sen. Dan Quayle, readying for this week's
Southern campaign swing, says he ``will eventually be an asset'' to
the Republican ticket and overcome the controversies that have
stalked his candidacy.
   In an interview Sunday with The Associated Press as he flew home
from his first solo campaign trip as the GOP vice presidential
nominee, Quayle acknowledged that he was still getting used to his
new situation.
   ``It's a little bit new, but what I will continue to do is just
project my vision of America, talk about why George Bush will offer
the best hope for continued prosperity.''
   Quayle says he talks ``periodically, but not daily'' to Bush,
and that the two men will probably spend more time campaigning
separately than together in order to better cover the country.
   Quayle, 41, comes from a wealthy Indiana publishing family and
his candidacy has been dogged by suggestions that strings were
pulled to get him into the National Guard during the Vietnam War
and law school after a mediocre college performance. Quayle has
denied those charges, but the issues have threatened at times to
overwhelm his campaign.
   Some major newspapers in editorials this week suggested that he
remove himself from the ticket, and even some Republicans have
admitted being uncomfortable with the senator, who was largely an
unknown quantity when he was picked. In the interview, Quayle said
he has had no second thoughts about running and was not hurt by
suggestions he step down.
   ``I will eventually be an asset to the ticket,'' Quayle said.
``I feel that I have a lot to offer in leadership. I feel I have a
lot to offer in the area of national defense. I feel that I have
worked very hard in the area of arms control.''
   Meanwhile, The Boston Globe reported Monday that Quayle, who
would head the federal fight against drugs if Bush won in November,
said he did not know that the vice president heads a key anti-drug
program.
   Quayle told the newspaper he was familiar ``in a general sense''
with the National Narcotics Border Interdiction System but did not
know who led it. Bush has headed the system since it was created in
1983.
   In his remarks to The AP, Quayle said he was proud of his work
with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., on a 1982 jobs training act
which is ``very important to millions of people that have gotten
jobs around America.''
   Quayle also said he hoped to release his income tax returns soon
because they would dispel notions that he is fabulously wealthy.
   ``I keep telling them to get it out as soon as possible so we
can get rid of another untruth out there about how wealthy I really
am,'' Quayle said. ``You're going to be shocked ... when you see
those tax returns.''
   Quayle traveled to the Midwest and West last week, and will
leave again Wednesday for a swing through the Southeast that will
take him through to Labor Day.
   In last week's seven-state trip, Quayle spent little time
talking about his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
except to praise Bentsen for his views on defense spending and
other issues. Most of his speeches outline a view that a victory by
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis would be a disaster
for the country.
   ``I've served with Sen. Bentsen for almost eight years. He is
not the issue,'' Quayle said. ``The issue is Michael Dukakis.
Michael Dukakis' view of America is a much different view than
George Bush's. Michael Dukakis' approach to national defense, his
approach to the economy, his approach to child care _ all of those
approaches are much different than George Bush's.''
   Quayle said he is not disturbed by polls that show much of the
public views Bentsen as more qualified for the vice presidential
spot, and to be president if it comes to that.
   ``The American people are just beginning to see Dan Quayle,'' he
said. ``I'm going to continue to talk about the issues. When we
have the debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle, the American
people will have a lot better picture of who will be the best
qualified vice presidential candidate.''

<TEXT>
   A Veterans Administration hospital has
allowed cardiologists to perform a delicate procedure on 70 heart
patients without a backup staff of heart surgeons, a published
report said today.
   The cardiologists, who are not surgeons but are trained in
internal medicine, performed coronary angioplasties, a non-surgical
procedure to unclog arteries, at the Long Beach Veterans
Administration Hospital, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   By not having heart surgeons on the staff, the practice placed
heart patients in unnecessary danger, according to a recent
national task force report on angioplasty, the Times said.
   Angioplasty, an increasingly common alternative to coronary
artery bypass surgery, unclogs heart arteries with a balloon-tipped
hollow tube inserted through the skin and threaded through a vein
in the groin to the heart.
   Dr. Victor Froelicher, chief of cardiology at the Long Beach VA,
and Dr. Arthur Graham, a spokesman for the veteran's headquarters
in Washington, said the hospital's program was safe and has had no
significant complications.
   They said a helicopter is ready to transport surgical
emergencies to Memorial Medical Center of Long Beach, about 5 miles
away.
   But VA spokeswoman Donna St. John in Washington said a team of
VA and outside experts will conduct an on-site review of the Long
Beach angioplasty program ``within the next few weeks.''
   This month, a joint American College of Cardiology-American
Heart Association task force recommended that all hospitals
offering angioplasty have an experienced heart surgery team
available at the hospital to perform emergency surgery.
   Their comprehensive angioplasty guidelines emphasize that
``there should be no exception to this requirement'' and said
transporting patients off-site for surgery ``cannot be condoned,''
the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope To Retrieve Sunken Mercury Space Capsule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of researchers is trying to raise $1.4
million to retrieve a 1961 Project Mercury space capsule from its
resting place deep in the Atlantic Ocean off Grand Bahama Island.
   Astronaut Virgil ``Gus'' Grissom, who was later killed with two
other astronauts when the Apollo 1 capsule caught fire in 1967, was
on board the Mercury capsule, which sank after splashdown. Some
accounts say Grissom caused the capsule to sink by detonating
explosive charges prematurely.
   ``There's a piece of American space history three miles down out
there, and we believe we can locate it _ and if it can be located,
then it can be recovered,'' said Curt Newport, who is leading the
search for Liberty Bell 7.
   Side-scan sonar devices, similar to those employed in 1985 to
locate the luxury liner Titanic at a depth of 2{ miles, would be
used to hunt for Liberty Bell 7, Newport said.
   Once the capsule was found, he said, a manned submersible vessel
would be used to attach a cable to the one-ton spaceship and reel
it to the surface.
   So far, however, there are no sponsors for the project.
   ``When I started looking into this back in late 1984, I always
thought that the most difficult part would be to convince people
that it could be recovered,'' Newport said. ``Now I'm finding that
the most difficult part is to locate someone willing to pay for
it.''
   Newport said the project has the backing of former astronaut
Thomas Stafford. Gregg Linebaugh, an analyst with the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Maryland, is a project partner, Newport said.
   The July 21, 1961, sub-orbital flight splashed down just 15
minutes after liftoff in the Atlantic Ocean about 300 miles
southeast of Cape Canaveral.
   A Navy helicopter was supposed to hook onto the capsule and lift
it a few feet above the water so Grissom could safely exit from the
side escape.
   As the chopper hovered overhead, however, explosive charges
mounted on the hatch apparently detonated prematurely _ allowing
the capsule to fill with water. Grissom managed to swim out before
the capsule sank.
   Some accounts, including one in the novel and movie ``The Right
Stuff,'' suggest Grissom panicked and blew the hatch too soon. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, however, absolved
Grissom of blame.
   Grissom was one of the seven original Mercury astronauts and the
second American to roar into space atop an 85-foot Redstone rocket.
   Newport said any chance of establishing what really happened
depends on finding the hatch door, where the explosives' detonator
was mounted. But the findings might be inconclusive, he said,
because the detonator switch could have been flipped by some force
other than Grissom, such as a powerful vacuum created during
re-entry.
   Newport, who lives in Annapolis, Md., and works for a NASA
subcontractor helping design America's first space station, said he
doubts that any significant flight data might be aboard. But
researchers believe it's possible that on-board cameras might have
film that could be developed if the equipment survived the
underwater pressures.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq today accused
Iran of stalling peace talks by rejecting the immediate reopening
of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
   The disputed waterway has been blocked by sunken ships since the
outbreak of the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   The peace talks resumed today at a downgraded, technical level
because both countries' foreign ministers removed themselves after
a snag developed late Sunday over Iraqi demands for full
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab.
   U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar met for six hours Sunday
night with the separate delegations and acknowleged the talks had
run into difficulties over the withdrawal of troops behind
internationally recognized borders.
   In reply to a question, the U.N. leader said: ``We cannot say
now that we have reached deadlock. ... The possibility always
exists.''
   With negotiations on the verge of a deadlock, Aziz said at a
morning news conference, ``We have not found any measure of good
faith from the other side'' since the peace talks started last week.
   ``I hope we will move back to the ministerial level as soon as
the disagreement is settled,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   ``The negotiations are continuing without underrating the
difficulties that we face at the moment,'' added U.N. spokesman
Francois Giuliani.
   Aziz said the immediate clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab would
allow Iraq to regain use of its only outlet to the sea.
   The foreign minister said this would provide ``an equitable
balance'' to the acceptance by Iraq of freedom of navigation for
Iranian vessels in the gulf, already enforced in accordance with
the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20.
   ``To my knowledge the U.N. secretary general has understood our
position and is sympathizing with it,'' Aziz said. There was no
immediate word from Perez de Cueller.
   Aziz added that Iraq is prepared to stay in Geneva to continue
the negotiations ``as long as the mission requires.''
   A statement made in Baghdad by Iraq's deputy foreign minister,
Saadoun Hamadi, threw doubt on the possibility of progress.
   Hamadi reiterated Iraq's claim to full sovereignty over the
Shatt-al-Arab. A 1975 treaty placed the Iran-Iraq border down the
middle of the waterway formed by the common estuary of the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers.
   Iraq repudiated the treaty in September 1980 shortly before
sending its army across the border to set off the war. More than 1
million were killed or injured in the war.
   ``Any attempt to minimize the full sovereignty of Iraq on this
vital lane would be faced with categorical rejection from our
side,'' Hamadi said. He also warned that ``Iran will face from our
side full preparedness to confront any behavior of aggressive
aspect.''
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati rejected Iraq's
claim to the entire waterway. He told reporters Sunday night that
the 1975 treaty had been accepted by both sides and could not be
abrogated unilaterally by Iraq.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran had declared in Tehran earlier
that any attempt to renegotiate the border would prolong the peace
talks for years.
   Velayati said his side had accepted the plan proposed by the
secretary-general calling for a cease-fire to be followed by a
troop withdrawal.
   ``We support these procedures but now everybody knows that Iraq
is trying to make obstacles in the way of full implementation of
the (U.N. cease-fire) resolution by raising some preconditions.''
   Iran accepted the U.N. resolution in July. Iraq accepted the
plan shortly after the Security Council passed it in July 1987.

   Weekend shootings that claimed 13 lives
forced police to deploy extra officers in one area and caution
against ``unrealistic expectations'' today at a second summit aimed
at ending gang warfare.
   Ten of the deaths were gang-related, police said. Three other
people were killed and one was critically wounded in three separate
shootings late Sunday night, but police said the three deaths
didn't appear to be gang-related.
   At least 17 other people were wounded in the shootings, police
said.
   The deaths of four people in three shootings in the
Harbor-Wilmington area south of downtown Los Angeles prompted
police to send extra officers Sunday to back up the usual force and
visit parents of reputed gang members, police said.
   Community leaders and clergy members, meanwhile, prepared to
bring warring gang members face-to-face today at a Los Angeles
church sharing a street corner with drug peddlers.
   A highly publicized round of similar talks last month led to
some job offers for gang members, but no end to the violence that
has claimed an average of one life a day in Los Angeles County.
Police cautioned people to keep their expectations low.
   ``Everybody is standing back and waiting for the seas to part
and all crime to fall between the cracks,'' said Los Angeles Police
Cmdr. William Booth. ``Those were unrealistic expectations that
were fanned really too much.''
   In the latest attack in the Harbor area, one woman was killed
and another wounded early Sunday morning in the parking lot of a
housing project, said Los Angeles police Sgt. James Allen. William
Oswald, 35, was booked Sunday in connection with the death of
Sherry Lytle, police said.
   A few hours earlier and a few blocks away, a gunman in a white
pickup truck shot a 30-year-old man, who later died at a hospital,
Allen said.
   Late Saturday night in the same area, two pedestrians _ a
16-year-old boy and a 21-year-old man _ were killed and four
others, including an apparently innocent bystander, were wounded in
a gang-related drive-by shooting, police said.
   One man was killed and two injured in a gang-related attack late
Sunday night in an area of South Central Los Angeles known for
narcotics sales, Sgt. Lee Bradford said.
   In southeast Los Angeles, an unidentified youth was killed
Saturday night in a gang-related shooting, said Lt. Doug Young.
   In nearby Riverside County, two 26-year-old men were fatally
shot early Saturday while sitting on the balcony at a condominium
complex 55 miles east of Los Angeles, said police Sgt. Mike Wilson.
   A 19-year-old man was fatally shot early Saturday while driving
to visit his mother in Compton, police said. The shooting occurred
in a known gang hangout, but authorities said they knew of no
motive for the crime.
   The same assailants were believed responsible for two shootings
Friday night in Inglewood that claimed the life of one teen-ager
and wounded two others, said Sgt. Ron Jackson.

<HEAD>`Model Policeman' Confesses to Shotgun Killing of Neighbor,
Authorities Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A veteran police officer described by his
boss as a ``model policeman'' has confessed to the shotgun killing
of a neighbor, against whom he allegedly harbored a grudge for 14
years, authorities said.
   Robert McLaughlin, 47, an 18-year Hampton police veteran, is
being held without bail on a charge of first-degree murder in the
June 1 killing of Robert Cushing, 63, a prominent real estate
broker.
   Until he surrendered to state police, McLaughlin had not been a
suspect in the killing, the attorney general's office said.
   McLaughlin remained in stable condition today at Portsmouth
Hospital, where he was taken after he surrendered Friday;
authorities said he was suffering from high blood pressure.
McLaughlin was arraigned Saturday at the hospital.
   Hampton Police Chief Robert Mark, in a telephone interview
Saturday, described McLaughlin as a ``model policeman. He had a
very good record.''
   The Boston Sunday Globe quoted Mark as saying that McLaughlin
once arrested Cushing on a minor charge when Cushing reportedly
tried to prevent police from taking pictures of two teen-agers who
died in a traffic accident near his home. However, on Sunday, Mark
denied making those comments.
   Today's editions of The Union Leader of Manchester quoted two
neighbors who gave two other possible explanations of what prompted
the grudge, both stemming from long-ago confrontations between
Cushing and McLaughlin.
   Assistant Attorney General Barbara Keshen said only that
McLaughlin made a misdemeanor arrest 14 years ago and Cushing
became involved indirectly.
   Since then, McLaughlin ``harbored ill-will feelings against Mr.
Cushing that seem to have come to a head on the evening of June 1,
where he admitted that he took his shotgun, loaded it, went over to
the Cushing residence and shot Mr. Cushing,'' Keshen said at a news
conference Saturday. Cushing, who was shot as he answered his front
door, died of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen.
   Keshen said the state would seek a first-degree murder
indictment against McLaughlin. The offense carries an automatic
sentence of life in prison without parole.
   The shotgun used in the killing has not been recovered, she said.
   Cushing's family criticized local officials' handling of the
case.
   The family said in a statement Sunday that it was
``unfortunate'' that officials gave ``incomplete and inaccurate
information about an incident 14 years ago and have characterized a
confessed murderer as a `model police officer.'''
   A son of the victim, Kevin Cushing, declined to explain what may
have sparked the grudge, saying the attorney general's office has
asked the family not to comment.

<HEAD>At Least 8 Reported Dead in Protests In Burma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State radio today reported at least eight
people died in protests and prison riots during the weekend in
Burma, where demonstrators are demanding an end to one-party rule.
   Hundreds of students chanting pro-democracy slogans marched
peacefully today through the center of the capital. The city's main
market was closed but food shops and some roadside stalls opened.
   Most government workers who went on strike earlier this month to
demand a return to democratic rule went back to their offices to
collect August paychecks but then returned home.
   Official Rangoon radio said police opened fire Sunday on about
80 demonstrators who attacked a police station in Minhala, about
250 miles northwest of Rangoon, killing six people and wounding
four.
   The incident began as a counter-protest to a demonstration the
day before by about 400 people, the radio said. It did not say what
the original demonstration was about.
   The radio also said today that two prisoners died during a riot
Saturday in the central jail of Mandalay, Burma's second largest
city about 400 miles north of Rangoon. It said inmates armed with
sticks destroyed their cells and ignored warnings broadcast on
loudspeakers that guards would open fire if the riot continued.
   ``Shots were fired to control the situation,'' the report said.
   The radio said inmates at the Htonbo prison camp near Mandalay
rioted shortly after midnight Friday and set fire to the camp.
Seventy-nine inmates escaped but seven were recaptured, it said.
   Htonbo was the fifth prison to experience prison riots since
Friday. Altogether, state radio has reported more than 2,300
prisoners escaping.
   At least 67 people have been killed and 130 wounded in the
breakouts. Authorities have been forced to release 5,461 inmates.
   The radio today reported four deaths in an attempted prison
escape Friday at Bassein, 90 miles west of Rangoon. It said three
were killed when troops fired on them and a fourth was killed by
other inmates. The report did not elaborate.
   In another development today, former President Win Maung and 20
other elder statesmen announced formation of a Committee for
Democracy. Win Maung, 72, was president under Prime Minister U Nu,
whose government was toppled by the 1962 military coup led by Ne
Win that ushered in one-party rule.
   Burmese sources said the new committee was not likely to have
great political significance and its formation did not appear to be
linked to demands by many Burmese for an interim government to lead
the nation to democracy.
   The Rangoon Bar Council denounced the government today for
waiting for a popular referendum to abolish one-party rule.
   ``The whole country has already rejected the one-party system by
the demonstrations, and procrastination by referendum ... would
only deepen the fast-deteriorating situation in the country,'' the
council said. ``The Bar Council therefore demands the government
form an interim government to carry on the process of
democratization in the country.''
   The turmoil in this isolated Southeast Asian nation began July
23 when 77-year-old Ne Win resigned after 26 years of authoritarian
rule. The ruling Burma Socialist Program Party chose hardliner Sein
Lwin to succeed him.
   Mass student-led demonstrations followed, leading to the
resignation of Sein Lwin and his replacement Aug. 19 by civilian
lawyer Maung Maung. The rallies since have been peaceful.

   Tropical Storm Chris spawned tornadoes
that damaged houses, destroyed mobile homes and caused at least one
death in the Carolinas before gradually weakening, losing its name
and heading toward Virginia today.
   High wind from the third named storm of the 1988 Atlantic
hurricane season also left thousands temporarily without power in
the Carolinas, and heavy rain flooded highways in South Carolina.
   The storm, which sprang to life from a tropical depression off
Florida, packed its strongest punch when it came ashore Sunday in
South Carolina.
   About 75 miles inland from the historic port city of Charleston,
S.C, a tornado touched down in a sparsly populated area and
devastated mobile homes, said Bob Kelly, a meteorologist with the
Columbia office of the National Weather Service.
   ``The winds took a swath, probably a half a mile long and
quarter of a mile wide,'' said Clarendon County Fire Chief Carter
Jones.
   Mary Lemon, 78, was killed when winds leveled her mobile home
while her granddaughter, 12-year-old Celessie Pearson, suffered a
severe back injury, said County Coroner Ranny Stephens. Thechild
was listed in critical but stable condition today at Richland
Memorial Hospital in Columbia.
   Between 15 and 30 mobile homes in Clarendon County were
destroyed when the tornado hit, said county Fire Chief Carter
Jones. U.S. Highway 301 was closed while authorities cleared it of
debris from the battered mobile homes, he said.
   ``It was a mess,'' said Carl Floyd, an engineer with the county
Fire Department. ``It took trailer houses and threw them clear
across the road. It was a complete disaster for the area.''
   One tornado in North Carolina threw a tractor-trailer rig into a
building at an Iredell County industrial park, officials said.
   At 7 a.m., the center of the storm was over south-central
Virginia, about 30 miles south of Roanoke, and was moving toward
the north-northeast at 20 mph, forecasters reported. Rain from the
storm was expected as far north as southeastern New York by later
today, said the weather service in New York City.
   On Sunday evening, the storm was downgraded to a tropical
depression, located near Columbia with maximum sustained winds of
30 mph in squalls.
   Winds with gusts to 44 mph in Charleston cut power to an
estimated 18,000 customers in coastal South Carolina and destroyed
one mobile home and overturned another near the community of Olanta.
   Several hundred households were without electricity this morning
after high winds and rain toppled some trees and utility poles.
Wayne Ennis of
   In North Carolina, Carolina Power & Light Co. said about 2,000
people lost power north of Oxford and outages also were reported in
several other communities.
   Forecasters predicted 3 to 5 inches of rain along the storm's
track across South Carolina and into North Carolina.
   Parts of Charlotte, N.C., reported up to 3.5 inches of rain late
Sunday with more than 1 inch falling at Greensboro during the three
hours ending at 4 a.m., the weather service said.
   ``I think it will certainly help in some respects,''
meteorologist Larry Lee said today in Raleigh, N.C. ``But it's much
too late to help crops. In terms of areas with groundwater and
reservoir problems, I think this storm will help.''
   The storm also spawned tornadoes in North Carolina that uprooted
trees, damaged mobile homes and tore shingles off roofs. But no
injuries were reported there.
   Iredell County, N.C., received the brunt of the violent weather,
with property damages estimated at $1 million. Tornadoes also were
reported in Alexander, Catawba and Cumberland counties, officials
said.
   Steve Vann, 21, watched one tornado touch down in Cumberland,
near Fayetteville.
   ``I seen it hit the ground about 3:30 p.m. The wind got to
whipping up pretty good, clouds moving in a tornado like motion,
then it quit raining. All of a sudden, it came out of nowhere,''
Vann said. ``It sounded just like somebody throwing a match on
gasoline _ Whoosh!''
   The storm left some Iredell County residents without gas or
electricity, authorities said.
   During Saturday and into early Sunday, Chris strengthened into a
tropical storm from a lopsided tropical depression that threatened
Florida's eastern coast. Depressions are upgraded to named storms
when their maximum sustained wind hits 39 mph, and to hurricanes
when sustained wind blows at least at 74 mph.

   The aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower
struck an anchored freighter this morning when it entered a harbor
on its return from a six-month deployment in the Mediterranean Sea,
the Navy and witnesses said.
   ``The Eisenhower may have received some superficial damage, but
the extent is unknown at this time,'' said Chief Petty Officer
Joseph C. Mowery, a spokesman for the U.S. Atlantic Fleet Command.
   ``We have no reports of any injury or any pollution,'' said
Chief Petty Officer A. Woods.
   The collision with the Spanish collier occurred at 8:22 a.m. and
the Eisenhower arrived at the Norfolk Naval Station at 9 a.m.,
Mowery said.
   The Spanish ship, identified as the 893-foot Urduliz, was
damaged above the waterline at the forecastle, said Capt. L.D.
Amory of the Virginia Pilots Association. A pilot will guide the
freighter from Hampton Roads harbor to a Norfolk pier where it
planned to take on 110,000 tons of coal, he said.
   Joyce Parnell, a secretary at the Chamberlin Hotel which
overlooks the passage into Hampton Roads from Chesapeake Bay, said
the Eisenhower drifted into the other ship. She told WNIS radio
that it was hooked on the tanker for about 20 minutes before tugs
pushed them apart.
   A spokesman for the Fifth Coast Guard District in Portsmouth
said the Coast Guard was not called for assistance, nor had it
recieved any reports of injuries within the port.

   Two trains crashed head-on in a rail
station in western Austria, killing at least five people and
injuring 46 others, railroad officials and police said.
   The accident occurred at 12:37 p.m. at Wolfurt, about three
miles from the West German border.
   Railroad Authority spokesman Walther Kollerits said the crash
involved a train coming from Linz en route to West Germany and an
express train bound for the resort city of Innsbruck from Lindau.
   Police in Vorarlberg said five bodies had been recovered from
the wreckage. Kollerits said the engines of both trains were
entangled and that one car was smashed to three-quarters its length.
   Kollerits identified one of the dead as a 67-year-old woman.
Police said 18 of the 46 injured were seriously hurt and that about
20 were West German citizens.
   All the injured were aboard the train headed for Innsbruck,
Kollerits said. He said there had been about 100 people on that
train.
   Kollerits said the cause of the crash was not known.

   A city task force has closed 65 illegal social

basement club in the Bronx that killed six people and injured more
than 30, city officials said.
   In the latest sweep, inspectors from the police, fire and

the clubs late Saturday and early Sunday, said Detective Louis
Llanes, a police spokesman.
   Before Saturday night, inspectors had ordered 39 of the
gathering spots closed, at least until the violations are corrected.
   ``This is something the city will continue to monitor and go
after,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for Mayor Edward I. Koch.
``This is not just hit and miss.''

   Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball pleaded
innocent today to alcohol-related manslaughter charges in a traffic
accident that killed two teen-agers and injured six others.
   The 1984 silver medalist stood silently, hands clasped behind
his back, as attorney Frank Quesada entered the plea before
Hillsborough Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe.
   Kimball, 24, is accused of driving the car that slammed into a
group of teen-agers the night of Aug. 1 at a popular roadside
hang-out called ``The Spot.'' Witnesses told police the car was
speeding up to 70 mph.
   He is charged with two counts of drunken-driving manslaughter
and three counts of drunken-driving in an accident with serious
injury. If convicted, he could face as much as 45 years in prison.
   Coe set a tentative trial date of Nov. 14 and allowed the diver
to remain free on $10,000 bond, with no travel restrictions. He
said he was satisfied that Kimball posed no risk of flight because
he was present in the courtroom today.
   Kimball agreed not to drive a car when the judge suggested that
as a condition of bond. Co-defense counsel Lee Fugate said it would
not be a problem because Kimball would be attending school and
working part time at his father's diving school and could get
around by walking.
   The judge also said the high-profile case had drawn so much
publicity that ``the whole country, in a sense, is watching him.''
   Kimball competed for a spot on this year's Olympic team after
the accident, but failed to make the squad.
   Among the spectators in the diving trials, held in Indianapolis
earlier this month, was a group of Florida residents protesting his
efforts to go to Korea for the summer games because of the deaths.
Members of Mothers Against Drug Driving were in the group.
   Prosecutors have refused to release results of Kimball's
blood-alcohol tests from the nighttime accident in the Tampa suburb
of Brandon. Authorities have said it was over the level of 0.10,
which is enough to make a motorist legally drunk in Florida.
   Coe instructed attorneys to notify witnesses that they would not
be allowed to publicly discuss the case. The judge cited concerns
for prospective jurors if the case goes to trial.
   Kimball, who lives in Michigan, plans to attend the University
of Michigan this fall, his lawyers said.

<HEAD>Los Angeles to Be Hit With Sanctions for Pollution</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency announced
plans today to ban major new sources of air pollution in the
nation's most populous urban area, greater Los Angeles.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas said similar action is planned
against at least three other cities by the end of this year unless
Congress revises the Clean Air Act.
   California officials have said they expect little effect from
the Los Angeles ban, which goes into effect Tuesday, because it
covers only large new plants that no one is planning to build in
the area, such as oil refineries.
   A stopgap congressional ban on agency sanctions expires at
midnight Tuesday, eight months after it was imposed to buy time for
Congress to produce changes in the law.
   The construction ban against sources of 100 tons of pollution a
year is imposed for failure to submit adequate air pollution
control plans showing compliance with federal pollution standards.
   All areas were supposed to have met those standards by Dec. 31,
1987. EPA maintains the law permits penalties only for failure to
submit and follow plans. There is no penalty for failure to meet
the standards if an agency-approved control plan did not work out.
   There have been several proposals to extend the compliance
deadline. But in the absence of congressional action, EPA has said
it intends to require new pollution control plans from the states
that will have to show steady reductions in pollution
concentrations.
   There has been no agreement in Congress on what should be done
about the missed deadlines, and when Congress reconvenes next month
it will have only about a month left in this year's session
   Los Angeles is one of about 100 cities, counties and
metropolitan areas that the EPA says missed last December's
deadline to meet health-protecting standards restricting levels of
carbon monoxide and ozone, a major component of smog.
   Ozone not only causes respiratory problems for humans but in
high concentrations can injure animals and damage crops, forests
and even building materials, according to EPA.
   It is formed in sunlight by a complex chemical reaction
involving volatile organic compounds such as gasoline and emissions
of nitrogen oxides from transportation and industrial sources.
   Ozone pollution frequently is worsened by the type of hot, dry
weather much of the nation has experienced this summer.
   Under the Clean Air Act, an area formally cited by EPA for
failing to meet the standards is subject to an automatic ban on
construction of new facilities that would emit more than 100 tons a
year of ozone or carbon monoxide.
   Before the moratorium was imposed, such bans were imposed on St.
Cloud, Minn., Albuquerque, N.M., the Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati
and various parts of Illinois.
   The law provides for other penalties such as a cutoff of federal
aid for air-pollution control programs and highway construction.
Albuquerque was hit with these sanctions, although EPA has proposed
lifting them.
   EPA officials say Los Angeles, which lacks an agency-approved
plan to clean up its air pollution, is just the first of a number
of cities that will face construction bans with the expiration of
the moratorium.
   They said that by late October bans could be imposed against
Ventura County, Calif., Chicago, and the northwestern Indiana area
adjacent to Chicago.
   Waiting in the wings are 10 more whose air-quality attainment
plans are on the verge of being formally rejected by EPA, an action
that would trigger construction bans.
   They are Denver; Atlanta; Dallas; Cleveland; Sacramento, Calif.;
Reno, Nev.; Bakersfield, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill.; Fresno,
Calif.; and Indiana counties adjacent to Louisville, Ky.
   EPA officials have indicated that Dallas may be scrubbed from
the sanctions list because of improvements made to its cleanup plan.
   They say there are no immediate plans to bring sanctions against
the other cities and areas among the 100 or so that have approved
air-quality plans but still failed to meet the standards by last
year's compliance deadline.
   In those cases, the agency appears to be waiting to see what
Congress does.
   Under proposals on both sides of Capitol Hill, the Clean Air Act
would be rewritten to grant more time to curb air pollution but
require areas with severe, stubborn problems to take tough
abatement steps, such as limiting vehicle entry to cities.
   Advocates of a strong new law also are pushing for increased
controls on vehicular emissions, which isn't a popular idea with
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   That panel is still trying to get a consensus on legislation
through closed-door negotiations principally between Dingell and
Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who comes from Los Angeles and wants a
stronger law.
   Committee sources, insisting on anonymity, say that after months
of sometimes angry confrontations, Dingell and Waxman several weeks
ago finally got down to business and began serious bargaining.
   They say, however, that the two lawmakers haven't even touched
the acid rain issue, which is far more complex politically and
geographically because the East wants the Midwest to clean up its
smokestacks and the West and South aren't excited about helping to
pay for the expensive job.
   On the Senate side, the Environment Committee has produced
legislation that has been ready for the floor for a year but hasn't
been able to get floor time principally because of opposition from
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The bill's acid rain provisions are a double whammy for Byrd.
His state has a number of coal-burning power plants that would have
to clean up emissions, and West Virginia's huge reserves of
high-sulfur coal could be

<HEAD>Witnesses Attack Quality of Rescue Swimmer School After Changes</HEAD>

   Navy officials expressed concerns about
pressure to graduate more students at a rescue-swimmer school just
two months before the death of a recruit, a witness testified today
in an officer's court-martial.
   ``Our feelings were we were going to be getting, initially, less
qualified individuals,'' said Chief Petty Officer John W. Singer,
the former top-ranking enlisted man at the Navy Rescue Swimmer
School at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
   The testimony came during the dereliction-of-duty trial of Lt.
Thomas A. Torchia, former officer in charge of the school on March
2, when Airman Recruit Lee Mirecki, 19, of Appleton, Wis., died
during a training exercise.
   Mirecki died from a fear-induced heart attack or drowning after
several instructors forced him into a swimming pool when he tried
to quit the voluntary program. One of them is accused of holding
Mirecki's head under water.
   Prosecutors contend any use of force to compel students to
complete training exercises is illegal.
   Singer said he, Torchia and others were concerned about the
quality of recruits as a result of pressure from higher authorities
to accept and graduate more students because of a shortage of
rescue swimmers.
   But he said Torchia's boss agreed no changes should be made to
make the course less rigorous. However, after Mirecki's death, the
Navy prohibited instructors from touching students.
   Torchia's lawyers are trying to show force was necessary for
realistic training and that the no-touching rule has produced
inadequately prepared rescue swimmers who will be a danger to
themselves and others.
   Cmdr. Dennis Hathaway, director of the related Navy Aircrew
School, testified Saturday that he was concerned about the quality
of new rescue-swimmer graduates who have practiced life-saving
techniques only on other students rather than instructors.
   ``Students are easier on each other than instructors were,''
Hathaway said.
   Rescue swimmers jump out of helicopters to go to the aid of
downed aviators, sometimes in heavy seas and at night.
   A Navy spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Dennis Hessler, has defended the new
curriculum and rules, saying it was approved by training officers
as well as rescue experts who work in the fleet.
   Torchia, 32, of Princeton, Ill., is accused of neglecting to
adopt policies to prohibit instructors from physically forcing
Mirecki into the pool after he had climbed out and shouted
``D-O-R,'' which stands for ``drop on request,'' the term for
quitting the school.
   He also is accused of failing to intercede at the scene to stop
the use of force. Torchia was talking on the telephone in his
office overlooking the pool at the time, but claims he saw and
heard nothing to indicate force was being used on the recruit.

   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis said today the fall campaign
against George Bush will be ``a long, hard competitive race,''
while aides to the Republican nominee said the vice president will
continue to paint his rival as weak on defense.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, meanwhile,
said he has not discussed the drug issue with Bush although the GOP
nominee has said that his vice president would oversee federal drug
policy in a possible Bush administration.
   The Indiana senator, in an interview with the Boston Globe
published in today's editions, also said he was familiar ``in a
general sense'' with the National Narcotics Border Interdiction
System but did not know who headed the system.
   Bush has led the system since its creation in 1983.
   The Democratic vice presidential nominee, Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, continued to cast doubts on Quayle's experience.
   ``Frankly, he would not have been on my short list as I look
over my Senate colleagues,'' Bentsen said Sunday when asked about
Quayle on NBC's ``Meet The Press.'' ``He obviously was on the short
list of the hard right. ...
   ``Now, I wouldn't say that he couldn't grow into the job; he
probably could. But if a tragedy befell a president, you'd have to
be able to move in immediately and take over and do what has to be
done in facing whatever issues that confront you at that time.''
   Democratic nominee Dukakis kicked off a two-day visit to the
western section of his home state, Massachusetts, where he sought
to halt the recent surge of his Republican opponent.
   ``It's going to be a long, hard competitive race,'' Dukakis told
a breakfast sponsored by the Northern Berkshire Chamber of
Commerce. ``One thing that inspires me every day and every week out
there on the campaign trail ... is that I know we can do it
together because I've seen it happen.''
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, said the vice president
will continue to stress his pro-military views in the coming week
and portray Dukakis as weak on defense. The GOP nominee's campaign
believes that theme is going over well.
   Bush was traveling today from Houston to St. Louis, where he
planned a tour of an aerospace plant, and then to Nashville for a
rally and visit to the Reserve Officer Training program at Middle
Tennessee State University.
   He returns to Washington tonight for a series of day campaign
trips to various states and may head west to California and
Colorado on the weekend.
   The vice presidential candidates planned some time off from the
campaign trail but used weekend appearances to criticize their
opponents.
   Bentsen, in suggesting that Quayle could not step right up to
presidency, was continuing a line of attack that was clear last
week: show that the 41-year-old Indiana senator lacked the depth
and experience for the job that is only a heartbeat away for any
vice president.
   Quayle declined to criticize his 67-year-old colleague in the
Senate, saying that his gripe is with Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis. In last week's seven-state campaign,
Quayle's only mention of Bentsen was to praise his views on defense
spending and other issues where he stands to the right of Dukakis.
   ``I've served with Sen. Bentsen for almost eight years. He is
not the issue,'' Quayle said Sunday in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``The issue is Michael Dukakis. Michael Dukakis'
view of America is a much different view than George Bush's.
Michael Dukakis' approach to national defense, his approach to the
economy, his approach to child care _ all of those approaches are
much different than George Bush's.''
   Quayle said doubts about his qualifications are nothing that a
good debate wouldn't cure.
   ``The American people are just beginning to see Dan Quayle,'' he
said. ``I'm going to continue to talk about the issues. When we
have the debate between Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle, the American
people will have a lot better picture of who will be the best
qualified vice presidential candidate.''
   Quayle traveled to the Midwest and West last week, and will
leave again Wednesday for a swing through the Southeast that will
take him through to Labor Day.
   Former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, interviewed on
ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' said meanwhile that the
Dukakis campaign can become too preoccupied with trying win back
conservative Democrats who have been voting for Ronald Reagan.
   ``I thould think the Democrats' strength is not between the
45-yard lines with this obsession to recall the Reagan Democrats
who are with Quayle under the Bush,'' he said.
   He said that more could be accomplished by massive registration
of new voters, and reaching out to the working and non-working poor.

   American and Canadian law enforcement officials
thwarted plans by a Yugoslavian anti-communist group to assassinate
Soviet-bloc athletes at the 1988 Winter Olympics, according to a
published report.
   Thirty-seven firearms illegally purchased in St. Petersburg,
Fla., were seized Jan. 3 at the Canadian border at Windsor, Ont.,
by provincial police, The Plain Dealer reported Sunday.
   The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, said the weapons were
destined for a group known as the Yugoslavians Against Communism
and were to be used to assassinate communist athletes at the
Olympics held in Calgary Feb. 13-28.
   The Plain Dealer reported the seizure has led Canadian and U.S.
authorities to investigate suspected renewed activity by the
Croatian National Resistance, Croatian Freedom Fighters and related
groups. Such groups have sought an independent state of Croatia in
what is now Yugoslavia.
   The continuing investigation involves federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms offices in Tampa, Fla., and Cleveland, along
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ontario Provincial Police
and other Canadian police agencies, the newspaper said.
   Charles Wallace, assistant special agent-in-charge of the
Cleveland ATF office, refused to discuss the investigation in
detail.
   ``The investigation is international in scope and it wouldn't be
appropriate for me to comment,'' Wallace said.
   Special agent Robert Cuddie, of the ATF office in Tampa, also
declined to discuss specifics of the weapons seizure at the
Canadian border.
   An affidavit by Cuddie filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa
alleged that a St. Petersburg man had another man buy 25
.25-caliber semiautomatic firearms, three other firearms and 1,000
rounds of ammunition from a St. Petersburg gun shop on Nov. 18,
1987, the newspaper said. The arms were part of the cache seized at
the U.S.-Canadian border.

<DATELINE>RAMSTEIN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany today suspended
military air shows and called on NATO to abandon such stunt flying
spectacles after three Italian fighter jets collided and one
slammed into a crowd in a fireball, killing at least 45 people.
   About 500 people were injured, including dozens who were
critically burned by jet fuel, in the accident Sunday at Ramstein
U.S. Air Base. Eleven Americans were in critical condition at a
U.S. Army hospital in Landstuhl, said Ramstein spokesman Sgt. Eddie
Lee.
   Bodies were charred and clothes burned off victims in what
appeared to be the world's worst air show tragedy involving
spectators. Many of the dead were children.
   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz quickly canceled a military air
show scheduled for September, and today annnounced that Bonn
officials and their NATO allies were suspending any further shows
in West Germany.
   More than 300,000 people, most of them Americans and West
Germans, were watching as the Italian air force team's 10 jets,
flying about 180 feet off the ground, intersected over the field
from three directions.
   Two planes plunged to the ground and a third careened in flames
into the crowd, setting off an inferno more than 100 feet high and
100 feet wide. Terrified spectators ran for their lives as the
flames scorched scores of people and destroyed buses, trucks and
cars.
   ``Some were missing skin on their arms,'' said DeeDee Arrington
Doke, a reporter for the unofficial U.S. military newspaper Stars
and Stripes.``A lot had black burns.''
   She said that after the crash ``people started crying and
screaming. The ones who were stopped were hugging each other and
crying like they were saying `What are we going to do?' The ones
who were running were screaming.''
   AFN, the U.S. military radio network, today quoted American
officials as saying at least 46 people were killed _ including the
pilots of the three Italian planes _ and 500 injured at the base 60
miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   Authorities issued no list of dead or injured and said
identification of victims would be a lengthy process becaused many
people were badly burned. The nationalities of the dead were not
known.
   ``They've been working throughout the night to identify the
bodies. Then the next of kin must be notified,'' Lee said. He said
he did not expect to have a casualty list until Tuesday.
   Rudolf Tartter, head of the local West German government
district that includes Ramstein, said 45 people were killed. There
was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
   ``Of those injured, 345 are seriously injured,'' Tartter said.
   ``There are many children among the dead and injured,'' said
Kris Kumpf, a medical assistant who treated some victims. ``And the
worst part of it is, we're still trying to find some of the
parents,'' she told reporters.
   A five-member medical team from the Brooke Army Medical Center
in San Antonio, Texas, flew to West Germany today to help treat
burn victims.
   Lt. Hans-Juergen Vollmer, spokesman for the local government
district, said he believed the accident was caused by pilot error.
He did not elaborate.
   Demonstrators opposed to air shows because of the risk of
accidents rallied outside Ramstein as Sunday's show began. After
the crash, some federal and local officials to demand an end to the
orchestrated aerial stunts.
   In Rome today, the Italian Defense Ministry said the Italian
stunt team involved in the disaster will continue to perform this
year but will limit its activities to simple fly-overs. ``Future
activity will be scheduled according to measures taken to safeguard
the safety of the spectators,'' a ministry statement said.
   On Sunday, a Finnish military training aircraft crashed at a
Belgian air base about 70 miles northeast of Brussels, killing the
pilot, police said.
   Scholz said in a statement today that officials will study ways
for West Germany and its NATO allies to demonstrate their air
forces' abilities to the public without endangering civilians.
   ``Until suggestions for effective measures are complete, there
will not be any more air shows with military aircraft in West
Germany, this with the agreement of the air forces of our NATO
allies,'' Scholz announced.
   He also said he was banning West German military aircraft from
doing stunts like the one that led to Sunday's disaster.
   ``The events at Ramstein confirm in a really horrible way how
dangerous such spectacles are even for civilian observers,'' said
Walter Kolbow, a federal lawmaker for the opposition Social
Democratic Party.
   Members of the Greens Party called for Scholz's resignation.
   At least seven aircraft accidents have occurred involving NATO
equipment this year in West Germany. One occurred at a Hanover air
show on May 7, when a British military helicopter's rotor blades
struck a loading ramp. Two British airmen were killed and 12
spectators injured.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said Sunday's disaster was the
worst air show tragedy in terms of spectator deaths. Thirty people
died when a jet crashed into a crowd in 1952 at Farnborough,
England, the BBC said. Forty-six people, most of them U.S. Army
parachutists, died in a helicopter crash at a 1982 air show in
Mannheim.

<HEAD>Mayor's Attorney Says Impeachment Trial Like `Shooting Casket'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to UPDATE with jury selection beginning.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ANDALUSIA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for a small-town mayor who
donned a turban and rubber snakes to proclaim ``National Voodoo
Week'' said the state's impeachment trial of the mayor is like
``shooting his casket.''
   Jury selection began today in Covington County Circuit Court in
the trial for Florala Mayor H.T. Mathis, 85, unless the case is
delayed on a motion by Mathis' attorney.
   Attorney General Don Siegelman and a county grand jury accused
Mathis of misusing his office by granting too many pardons for
drunken drivers.
   The mayor also is accused of willful neglect of duty,
incompetency in office and corruption. Presiding over the trial is
Circuit Judge Billy Baldwin in Andalusia.
   Mathis' attorney, James Prestwood of Andalusia, said the trial
is moot with the mayor's four-year term ending Oct. 3. Prestwood
has filed a motion asking Baldwin to delay it.
   ``It's almost like waiting for his funeral and shooting his
casket,'' Prestwood said.
   The Florala City Council has chastised the mayor for his
performance in office, including spending city funds without proper
City Council approval.
   And last month, the mayor sprinkled ``voodoo dust'' around City
Hall to ``drive out the evil spirits,'' later describing the
incident as a joke that got out of hand. But he topped that by
declaring ``National Voodoo Week'' in the south Alabama town,
reviving the publicity over the joke.
   Mathis said if the trial starts this week, he will be ready ``to
tell the truth, just like I always have.''
   ``I've had people all over the state call to wish me luck,'' he
said. ``I believe the Lord will see me through this.''
   Assistant Attorney General David Christy said those found guilty
of impeachment charges are only removed from office. They are not
fined or sent to jail, though they can face another trial for the
same crimes. Impeachment trials are civil proceedings that are
quasi-criminal in that they are conducted much like criminal trials.
   In Alabama, an official thrown out of office can appeal directly
to the state Supreme Court.
   The last impeachment in Alabama was of former Choctaw County
Clerk Elizabeth Lewis, who was removed from office in 1979. In
1980, the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the Lewis conviction in a
landmark state case.

   Many schools in the Soviet capital will be cutting
back from a six-day week to five days when the new term starts
Thursday, Radio Moscow said.
   ``Teachers believe children will have more time for independent
study and for sports, and that is an important trend in the
educational reform being introduced,'' the radio reported Monday.
   The radio said first-graders will be in school five days a week,
and that many of Moscow's schools also will switch entirely to a
five-day week.
   Soviet children traditionally have attended classes Monday
through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. or 1:30 p.m.,
depending on their age.
   The radio report did not say how much the school day would be
increased to make up for the Saturday classes.
   Soviet officials are trying to cut down the emphasis on
memorization in schools, instead urging more independent thinking
and training in computers and other advanced technology. Communist
Party leaders say education reforms are crucial if the Soviet Union
is to catch up with the West.

   Publishers announced Monday the launching of a
new English-language daily, the Nation, the first newspaper to open
in Israel in four years.
   The tabloid that will feature color photographs begins
publication Friday and will compete with Israel's only other
English-language daily, The Jerusalem Post.
   The Jerusalem Post, founded in 1932 as The Palestine Post, began
publishing under its present name in 1950 and has a circulation of
about 50,000.
   Unlike the Post, a liberal newspaper sympathetic to the
left-leaning Labor Party, The Nation has no political affiliation,
according to the paper's American-born publisher Hesh Ketzon.
   ``The editorial line of the Nation is simply not to have an
editorial line,'' Ketzon told Israel radio.
   According to Ketzon, about 8 percent of Israel's 3.5 million
people are native English speakers who read English-language
newspapers.
   The last daily newspaper to open in Israel was the
Hebrew-language Hadashot, which began circulating in March 1984.

<HEAD>Three Acquitted of Former Minister's Murder But Arrested Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men were found innocent Monday in
the murder of a former Cabinet minister, but they were arrested
moments after the judge acquitted them.
   Plainclothes officers took into custody businessman John
Katabaazi, 28, and army deserters Peter Kiwanuka, 22, and Silvester
Wadda, 25, as they left the High Court building where they had been
on trial for the March 6, 1987, murder of Andrew Kayiira, a former
energy minister. It was not known why they were arrested again.
   The murder case against them was dropped by Justice Charles Kato
who said the prosecution had ``failed to convince the court that
the three accused persons participated in the murder of Kayiira.''
   Kayiira was shot and killed 10 days after he was acquitted of
plotting to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni's government. The
killing took place at the Kampala home of Henry Gombya, a
free-lance journalist who worked for the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Kato said the prosecution's failure to produce Gombya or his
wife as witnesses ``left much to be desired.''
   Gombya, who lives in Britain, has said Kayiira's murder was
politically motivated and not a robbery as officials claimed.
   Kayiira headed the Uganda Freedom Movement, a guerrilla group
that fought alongside Museveni's National Resistance Army in a
five-year bush war against civilian Presito mount a massive
assault against Clover Mist.
   ``We had to wait until it got to where we could get at it,''
Kaunert said. ``This fire has kicked us for months. Now we're going
to kick it back.''
   In addition to the towns, the fire also threatened some of the
most productive timber land in the Clarks Fork Ranger District.
   Enough timber is harvested annually out of the threatened area
to build 100 homes, Forest Service District Ranger Randy Herzberg
said
   ``It's very valuable timber as far as the local economy goes,''
he said.

   A tame 10-point buck that lived in a park
was shot and stabbed with an arrow, officials said.
   ``It was a senseless killing,'' said Bruce Fuller, director of
``Lefty'' Hymes Memorial Deer Park. ``By far, the vast majority of
archers are quite conservation minded and sportsman minded. They'll
look at this as a black eye for the archers.''
   The buck would come up to almost anyone, Fuller said Sunday.
   ``It was probably dazed from the initial shot,'' Fuller said,
explaining why it didn't flee. ``It didn't know any better; it had
never been hurt.''
   The dead buck was discovered Saturday morning.
   ``It was shot and killed with a bow and arrow, shot twice. Once
in the neck and the rib cage. There were (arrow) stab wounds in the
neck. It was done right through the fence,'' Fuller said.
   The animal was the park's dominant buck, used for breeding,
Fuller said, adding that 11 Virginia whitetail deer remain in the
herd at the city-owned park.

   A motorist who plunged 50 feet from an overpass
to an expressway in an upside-down station wagon walked away from
the accident.
   ``I swerved to avoid an accident and the next thing I know I'm
going over the guardrail,'' said Ronald V. Zielin, 17, of Chicago.
``I just started screaming and screaming.''
   State police said Zielin was driving a station wagon that was
struck by an oncoming car, then plunged 50 feet from an overpass
onto the hood of another car Sunday.
   But Zielin slithered out of the automobile and walked toward the
shoulder of the road, police said.
   ``I thought, `I'm going to die and it's really going to be
bad,'' Zielin said.
   Zielin and the two occupants of the car that struck his were
listed in fair condition at Martha Washington Hospital. Three
occupants of the car struck by the falling station wagon also were
hospitalized in fair condition.

   A group of people took over historic
Fort Vancouver early today, threatening to destroy the old log
structure if they are rushed by authorities, police said. Witnesses
heard two explosions inside the stockade.
   The group was discovered in the fort, built in the early 1800s,
about 8 a.m., said Carolyn Demme, a police spokeswoman. They told
authorities they were armed.
   The cannons in the fort are operable, and the group threatened
to destroy the fort if police tried to force their way in, Ms.
Demme said, adding that explosions were heard within the walls this
morning.
   Ms. Demme was unsure whether black powder and shot was available
inside the fort, but said the intruders could have brought their
own ammunition.
   The group has made demands, she said, but it was not immediately
clear what those demands were. It was also unclear how many people
were inside, or when they entered the fort.
   Fort Vancouver is normally locked, except for daytime tours.
   The stockade was used as a fur trading post from 1825 to 1849
and was named a national historic site in 1961. The fort is bigger
than a city block.

   A wooden bridge collapsed Monday as
Bhuddist pilgrims were crossing it and 13 people were injured,
authorities said.
   Witnesses said about 20 people were on the 500-yard-long
pedestrian bridge over the Bagmati River at the time of the
accident.
   The devotees were going to Patan from Katmandu to a Buddhist
festival in the ancient city situated south of the Nepalese capital.
   Two of the injured were hospitalized in critical condition.
   The 66-year-old bridge was one of the three spans linking the
cities of Katmandu and Patan. Although authorities banned vehicular
traffic from the bridge after a truck fell off it five years ago,
it was heavily traveled by pedestrians.

   A judge accused of numerous ethics
violations, including a complaint that he had sex with a woman in
his courtroom, has been suspended from the bench pending review of
the charges.
   Lamar County District Judge Johnny Langley is charged in a
seven-count complaint issued by the state Judicial Inquiry
Commission, a state panel that functions like a grand jury in
judicial ethics matters.
   Langley's secretary said today that the judge was meeting with
his attorney and was unavailable for comment. She said he would
make a statement later.
   A spokesman for Attorney General Don Siegelman's office said
today that Langley would remain suspended pending a review of the
complaint by the State Court of the Judiciary, which can remove
judges from the bench. A spokesman for the attorney general's
office, Larry Childers, said Langley was notified of the suspension
Friday.
   The complaint accused Langley of having sex with a woman ``on
top of the bench in his courtroom in the Lamar County Courthouse at
Vernon.'' He also is accused of threatening the woman, who
cooperated with authorities.
   The complaint accuses Langley of arranging for the payment of a
$100 personal debt with marijuana instead of cash.
   Langley also is accused of refusing to sign search and arrest
warrants for the seizure of pornographic videotapes and with
keeping pornographic tapes showing explicit scenes of sexual
activity in his office at the courthouse.

   The disaster at the Ramstein air base in West
Germany casts a shadow over the air shows that are among Europe's
favorite spectator sports as well as being the major marketplaces
of the international aerospace industry.
   But while Germany has suspended military air exhibitions and
some calls are being heard for other European countries to do
likewise, the shows look likely to go on.
   Sunday's tragedy at the U.S. Air Force base at Ramstein came a
week before Europe's biggest aviation event _ England's Farnborough
Air Show _ and although Farnborough hasn't experienced an accident
involving spectators since 1952, the Ramstein disaster immediately
prompted thoughts about safety at the show.
   In Britain, Ken Collins, a Labor Party member of the European
Parliament, wrote to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Monday
urging that Farnborough be canceled because, ``We cannot afford to
take any more needless risks with human life.''
   Organizers said the show would go on, but spokesman Duncan
Simpson, a former test pilot, said: ``No one would deny that after
an accident like that we all have to think very hard.''
   However, he said the safety rules already were so strict that
there was little scope for major change.
   Pilots at Farnborough have to perform their display for a
committee of experts before the show opens. They cannot fly over or
toward the spectators, they must maintain a minimum altitude of 100
feet and must keep to the side of the runway farthest from the
grandstands.
   ``I would never say an incident will never happen,'' Simpson
said in an interview. ``They do happen occasionally. What we are
concerned with is ensuring that in the likelihood of an accident,
the catastrophic consequences should be reduced to an absolute
minimum.''
   Paul Beaver, managing editor of Janes' Defense Data, the
authoritative military publishing concern, reckons that air shows
statistically are 10 times safer than highways.
   ``You're much less likely to be hurt at an air show than driving
to it,'' he said in an interview.
   Farnborough alternates with Le Bourget in Paris at holding the
annual show, one of the world's leading showcases for new aircraft.
   The highlight among the 160 aircraft from more than 30 countries
at this year's 10-day show is the MiG-29. It is the first advanced
Soviet warplane to go on public display in the West.
   Simpson said it was impossible to quantify the amount of money
involved in deals struck at Farnborough or Le Bourget, but believed
the total regularly runs into billions of dollars.
   The trade shows attract around 150,000 visitors, but are geared
mostly for buyers and sellers. ``The public is less important. You
have to have them, but it's not that that counts,'' said Patrick
Guerin, a French aerospace industry spokesman.
   Shows like the one at Ramstein, by contrast, are geared strictly
for the public, serving as showcases for air forces to show off
their prowess.
   ``The public want them. They flock in large numbers. It's just
like motor racing or rally driving, it's a fact of life,'' said
Simpson.
   For air forces, aerobatics teams like Britain's Red Arrows
provide valuable training and serve a public relations role,
frequently performing abroad as ambassadors for their country, he
said.
   The Red Arrows team has suffered a series of accidents in recent
years. These have never harmed spectators, but after the Ramstein
accident, The Daily Telegraph editorialized: ``The time has arrived
to consider whether exhibitionism in the air and large, static
crowds can co-exist and, if they can, what measures could reduce
the risk of further disaster.''
   While some Italian newspapers called for an end to public shows,
the Italian Defense Ministry announced that its team will stick to
its 1988 schedule of performances, but at a reduced level.
   Beaver doubted Ramstein would put a damper on British aerobatics
shows. ``Half the thrill is to see the planes as close as one can _
the noise and atmosphere of being there,'' he said.

   A small fire on the 28th floor of a 54-story
building downtown caused an estimated $5,000 damage, but sprinklers
quickly doused it and there were no injuries, officials said.
   The fire at the Wells Fargo Bank building was the result of
spontaneous combustion and started at 4:08 a.m. Monday in a storage
room filled with rags and refinishing products, said Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells.
   The fire was out when firefighters arrived, Wells said. Wells
was unsure if anyone was in the building, but he said no one was
injured.
   Fire Capt. Bob Wiegert said: ``The sprinkler paid for itself,
saved this building this morning.''
   On May 4, fire at the 62-story First Interstate Bank tower, left
one man dead and caused $450 million in damage. A sprinkler system
was being installed there at the time. Some of the tenants forced
out may be allowed back next month, building officials announced
over the weekend.

<TEXT>
   The chief of South Korea's army
intelligence was fired Monday in connection with an alleged attack
this month on a journalist, military officials said.
   Maj. Gen. Lee Jin-baek, who headed the Army Intelligence
Command, had been questioned to determine whether he instigated an
Aug. 7 attack of Oh Hong-kun, city editor of the Joong-Ang Economic
News, the military said.
   A major and three non-commissioned officers of the intelligence
command have been arrested on charges of slashing Oh's thigh with
knives. The four admitted attacking Oh in retaliation for articles
he wrote criticizing the military for blocking democratic
development, officials said.
   The dismissal came amid calls by the political opposition for
punishment of all officers linked to the case.
   Two brigadier generals under Lee were fired Sunday after they
were found to have been involved in either the attack or in a
suspected cover-up. Military authorities said charges against the
two were under consideration.
   Opposition leaders charged the attack demonstrated a hawkish
trend in the govenment and indicates hard-liners want to crack down
on political dissent. They contend other military officers were
involved in the attack.
   The military originally denied any soldiers were involved. Under
intense opposition criticism, however, the government ordered the
military investigation.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam urged President Roh Tae-woo to
take stern action against any officers found to be involved in the
attack, aides to Kim said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of every four U.S. workers is now a
college graduate, compared with just one in every five 10 years
ago, the Labor Department said Monday in a report showing
significant increases in education levels in the American workforce.
   An additional 20 percent, up from 16 percent a decade ago, have
completed one to three years of college, according to the new data
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   At the same time, the proportion of workers without a high
school diploma has declined from 24 percent in 1978 to 15 percent
today, the bureau said. The share of the work force ending their
formal education at the completion of high school remains unchanged
at 40 percent.
   While differences in the proportion of college graduates still
exist among whites, blacks and Hispanics, all three groups have
shown significant increases in the past 10 years.
   Among white workers, 26 percent are now college graduates, up
from 21 percent in 1978. Fifteen percent of black workers and 13
percent of Hispanic workers are college graduates, up from 10
percent and 9 percent, respectively, a decade ago.
   Meanwhile, the percentage of high school dropouts has fallen
from 40 percent to 23 percent for blacks, from 52 percent to 40
percent among Hispanics and from 14 percent to 8 percent among
whites.
   The survey, taken in March, continued a pattern showing that
workers with the most education incur the least unemployment.
   The jobless rate for college graduates was just 1.7 percent,
compared with unemployment rates of 3.7 percent for workers with
one to three years of college, 5.4 percent for high school
gradutates and 9.4 percent for high school dropouts.
   At an all-time low 3.3 percent, the unemployment rate for black
college graduates, however, was still more than twice the 1.5
percent rate among white college graduates.
   While the proportion of working-age men in the labor force
dropped slightly _ from 89.8 percent in 1978 to 88.6 percent this
year _ it increased dramatically for women.
   Two of every three women of working age now hold jobs or are
actively seeking them, compared with 56.1 percent a decade ago. The
most dramatic gains, according the Labor Department, have been
among women college graduates, up from 70.8 percent in 1978 to 80.6
percent this year, and those with one to three years of college, up
from 61.9 percent to 74.7 percent.

<TEXT>
   The mayor of the U.S. Seventh Fleet's home port and
the prefectural governor lodged official protests Monday over the
planned arrival of two U.S. warships capable of carrying nuclear
weapons.
   Civic groups have announced plans to protest the arrival
Wednesday of the two ships, which will be stationed with the U.S.
Seventh Fleet at Yokosuka to replace two frigates.
   Yokosuka Mayor Kazuo Yokoyama and Kanagawa Gov. Kazuji Nagasu
demanded to know whether the Ticonderoga-class guided missile
cruiser Bunker Hill and the destroyer Fife will be carrying
Tomahawk nuclear missiles when they enter Yokosuka.
   They delivered their protests in visits with Foreign Minister
Sosuke Uno and urged the government to uphold its constitutional
stance against manufacturing, possessing or allowing into Japanese
territory any nuclear weapons, officials said.
   ``It goes without saying that this issue has brought great
unease to the citizens of Yokosuka and strongly threatens the
safety of life,'' Yokoyama was quoted as telling Uno.
   The two leaders criticized the system that will allow the two
warships to enter Yokosuka, their spokesmen said.
   Both ships are capable of deploying Tomahawk nuclear and
non-nuclear missiles. Under a bilateral agreement, the United
States must notify Japan beforehand if it plans to bring nuclear
weapons into the country.
   ``Since there has been no prior consultation, the government
considers that there is no doubt nuclear weapons will not be
introduced,'' a Foreign Ministry official quoted Uno as telling
Yokoyama.
   Nagasu also delivered his message to U.S. Ambassador Mike
Mansfield, along with a petition against the warships' arrival that
contained almost 100,000 signatures.
   ``The existing system of prior consultation has not been enough
to dispel public unease,'' Nagasu said. ``It is extremely
regrettable that the two ships will enter Yokosuka port.''
   The U.S. military has maintained a policy of neither publicly
confirming nor denying the existence of nuclear weapons aboard its
ships.

   Thirteen blacks were killed in
townships outside four Natal province cities, police said Monday.
Residents said most were killed and mutilated in factional fighting
over land.
   Also on Monday, police fired tear gas and sprayed purple dye
from a water cannon at students who gathered at the University of
Durban to protest the expulsion of 150 students who couldn't pay
their fees, students and teachers said. Two students were injured
and hospitalized.
   Police said university authorities called them to the campus
because students wielding knives had surrounded a post office
employee collecting money from telephone booths.
   A black candidate in upcoming municipal elections was
assassinated Saturday in Soweto, a black township of Johannesburg,
police said. The elections are opposed by many anti-apartheid
organizations.
   An estimated 600 blacks have died in factional violence in the
Natal province in the past 18 months. Most of the fighting has been
between supporters of the banned United Democratic Front, a
multiracial anti-apartheid federation, and members of the more
conservative Zulu political organization, Inkatha.
   Residents and independent groups said the fighting Sunday in
Molweni, near Durban, stemmed from land disputes. Thousands of
blacks lost their homes in flooding a year ago and have been moving
from town to town, settling wherever they find unused land.
   The fighting also reportedly involved disputes between the
United Democratic Front against traditional village leaders and
vigilantes. The residents and independent monitoring groups said
those killed were disemboweled, and one handicapped man who was
killed had his arm severed and taken away.
   The area has a long history of mutilation killings, which are
connected with sorcery in which parts of human bodies, particularly
those of enemies, are used to bring power and good luck.
   The daily unrest report from police headquarters, which gives
few details, said groups of blacks attacked and killed 10 other
blacks in three incidents at Molweni.
   Police also said they found the bodies of three black men in
different areas of Kwandegezi, a township near Durban. It was
assumed the deaths resulted from factional violence.
   Police on Monday reported the assassination of David Nkomo, 45,
a black candidate for the Soweto city council. The black-oriented
City Press newspaper said two men went to his home Saturday and
fired seven bullets, hitting him twice in the head.
   State-of-emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest,
security force action, treatment of detainees, some forms of
protest and various statements the government considers subversive.
The regulations prohibit calls for election boycotts.
   The Oct. 26 municipal elections mark the first time all races in
the country will vote on the same day. Many blacks feel that
participation in governmental structures perpetuates apartheid, or
racial segregation in which the nation's 26 million blacks have no
voice in national affairs.
   In the last black municipal elections in 1984, less than 20
percent of blacks voted.
   The outlawed African National Congress, the main guerilla group
fighting to overthrow the government, has called for a boycott of
the elections.

the spots were authentic. A sale was negotiated for fair market
value, but Mrs. Moore did not reveal the price.

<TEXT>
   The nation apparently wasn't all our forefathers
fathered. Revolutionary War-era records show that sex was ``part of
serious courtship'' and often resulted in premarital pregnancy, a
historian writes.
   Americans in the late 1700s ``were more licentious than we
imagine them to be,'' Jack Larkin writes in American Heritage
magazine's September-October issue.
   Larkin cites birth and marriage records of several dozen
American communities to prove that in the late 18th century,
pregnancy was frequently a prelude to marriage. In rural New
England, nearly a third of brides were already with child.
   ``The frequency of sexual intercourse before marriage was surely
higher, since some couples would have escaped early pregnancy. For
many couples, sexual relations were part of serious courtship,'' he
wrote.
   ``People today tend to assume we've reached the ultimate level
of moral looseness, and that you can look back through our history
at a steadily rising level of immorality, building up to the
present,'' Larkin said in an interview. ``But in fact these things
have gone in cycles.''
   The concept of randy revolutionaries is particularly surprising
in straitlaced New England, considering ``the popular notion of
what Puritanism was all about,'' Larkin said.
   Seventeenth-century New England was indeed a strict society, but
sexual freedom began to increase as the region became more socially
and economically diverse. And, as resistance to British rule spread
throughout the colonies in the late 1700s, ``all hell broke
loose,'' he said.
   Lest anyone confuse Salem with Sodom or Gloucester with
Gomorrah, however, Larkin offers this caveat: ``Pregnancies usually
simply accelerated a marriage that would have taken place in any
case. ... Most rural communities simply accepted the `early
pregnancies' that marked so many marriages.''
   Larkin is chief historian at Old Sturbridge Village in
Sturbridge, Mass., a recreation of an 18th-century village. This
fall Harper & Row will publish his book, ``The Reshaping of
Everyday Life in the United States, 1790-1840.''
   When early American communities did censure premarital
pregnancy, it often was more a matter of economics than morals. The
rule, as enunciated by Asa Lincoln, justice of the peace in
Brimfield, Mass., was: ``born a bastard and chargeable to the
town.''
   Accordingly, if a woman were still unmarried by the time she
gave birth, officials might interrogate her during labor about the
father's identity _ not as much to condemn him for immorality as to
get him to support his child.
   Sexual mores began to change in the 1820s, Larkin says, as the
turbulent war years receded and society became more settled and
more strict.
   Community records in this period show that the proportion of
women who conceived a child before marriage steadily declined. By
1840, the premarital pregnancy rate in New England towns dropped
from nearly one pregnant bride in three to one in five or six. In
some places, prenuptial pregnancy dropped to 5 percent.
   ``For many Americans this marked the acceptance of new limits on
sexual behavior, imposed not by their parents or other authorities
but by themselves,'' Larkin writes.
   ``(They) were marrying later than their parents, often living
through long engagements while the husband-to-be strove to
establish his place in the world. They chose not to risk a
pregnancy that would precipitate them into an early marriage.''
   Such points, Larkin said, are hard to make at a family place
like Old Sturbridge Village.
   ``That's why I wrote the book,'' he explained. ``Some things are
hard to show in a museum.''

   New-home sales suffered their steepest drop in
seven months in July, the government said Monday, and economists
predicted further softening as rising mortgage interest rates push
up the cost of buying a home.
   Sales of new single-family homes fell 4.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 686,000 units last month,
according to a joint report of the departments of Commerce and
Housing and Urban Development.
   The government also revised estimates for June and May downward,
showing less housing strength than previously believed.
   Fixed-rate mortgages have risen by almost a point since March to
their highest levels of the year, boosting the monthly payment on a
new $100,000 mortgage by about $65.
   And a half-point boost earlier this month in Federal Reserve's
key bank lending rate ``doesn't bode very well for the coming
months,'' said Thomas M. Holloway, senior economist at the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America. He predicted another half-point or
so increase in mortgage rates by the end of the year.
   ``That should be considered quite discouraging,'' Holloway said.
   However, other economists noted that even though new-home sales
in July took their sharpest tumble since a 6.2 percent drop in
December, they were still strong. The decrease in July followed a
6.7 percent increase in June, which buoyed sales to the highest
level since April 1987.
   Economists attributed the June upturn in part to attempts by
buyers to close deals before interest rates went higher.
   ``The June number was unusually high, so I'm certainly pleased
by the July number,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the
U.S. League of Savings Institutions. ``If (interest) rates continue
to go up, then we'll certainly see some decrease in sales activity,
but overall it's not looking too bad.''
   Rate increases ``have been gradual enough not to add any
psychological fuel to the fire,'' Obrinsky said. ``The rates are
still relatively affordable and they are still lower than they were
last fall.''
   For the first seven months of the year, new home sales were 3.0
percent lower than in the same period a year earlier.
   The July drop in new home sales was in line with other housing
indicators for the month. Construction starts of single-family
homes fell 0.8 percent and sales of existing homes were off by 5.0
percent.
   Meanwhile, the price of new homes was up sharply in July even
though sales fell. The median price of a new home rose to $123,500,
5.6 percent above the June median price of $117,000, meaning half
the homes sold in those months cost more and half less.
   The average price of a home was up as well, climbing 7.1 percent
to $146,000.
   According to Michael Sumichrast, a Washington-based economist
and publisher of a construction newsletter, blamed the price
increases rather than interest rates for declining sales last month.
   ``Prices ... just cannot continue at these levels. ... They just
went totally crazy ... and it's finally catching up, particularly
in New Jersey and New York,'' he said.
   By region, sales in July were down most steeply in the
Northeast, where they fell 18.4 percent to an annual rate of
93,000. The Midwest posted a 5.5 percent decline to a rate of
86,000 and sales in the South fell 4.9 percent to a rate of
270,000. Sales in the West were up 2.6 percent to a rate of 237,000.
   Sumichrast predicted declining sales in all four regions next
year. He said the drop would be most moderate in the South and
Midwest, and steepest in the West and Northeast, where prices are
highest.

<HEAD>Peace Activists Publish Travel Guide for Missile Silos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cover picture, of the snow-capped
Rocky Mountain Front, could be from any mountain guidebook. But the
missile silo in the foreground is the tipoff that ``Nuclear
Heartland'' is not ordinary.
   The 96-page paperback, which sells for $12.50, was put together
by peace activists who say it is the first complete series of
detailed maps showing where 1,000 Minuteman missile silos and their
launch control centers are located in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado,
Missouri and the Dakotas.
   The idea is to make people in those states aware of the ``unseen
weapons,'' said editor Sam Day, and ``to encourage people to
approach them and contemplate their meaning.''
   Included are 200 missile silos in the Malmstrom Air Force Base
range, about 12 percent of Montana.
   Capt. Don Planalp, Malmstrom public affairs officer, said the
Air Force has no objection to the maps. ``It's no secret where the
missiles are,'' he said. ``We can assume our enemies know where
they are.''
   Planalp also said people are free to look at missile silos from
adjoining property, but not from in the federal property line, 25
feet outside the fences surrounding the silos.
   When people stand near a missile and think about its destructive
force, and about the force of the Soviet missiles aimed at them, it
can spur them to help end the arms race, Day said.
   The book, published by The Progressive Foundation of Madison,
Wis., pinpoints the missiles on maps, with short descriptions of
how to get to each one. While the guidebook lists missiles by their
official Air Force name, it also calls them by the nicknames given
them by the local volunteers who double-checked the locations.
   Some missiles were named for peace activists, including Mark's
missile, after Mark Anderlik of Missoula, Mont., who coordinated
the Montana map-making effort.
   The veteran nuclear protester says it is amazing how many people
do not know how many missiles are in their state and even more
amazing that many people live right next to missiles without
realizing it.
   With 200 missiles to nickname in Montana alone, the volunteers
displayed a combination of humor, moral indignation and cynicism.
   Humorous names include the We Don't Think About It and Harmful
If Swallowed missiles. Names describing the effects of nuclear war
include: Burning Bodies, Radiation Sickness and Living Hell
missiles. Political names include Bipartisan and Money is No
Object. Missiles named Jesus Wept, Shameless Swaggering,
Compassion's Mortuary and Murder Suicide reflect moral outrage.
   Like more orthodox travel guides, the book also pointed out
sites its authors thought were of particular note in each state.
   Montana's noteworthy points include the first activated
launch-control facility, which President Kennedy used as his ``ace
in the hole'' during the Cuban missile crisis; a silo alleged to be
inhabited by an Indian spirit; and silos near where peace camps and
demonstration arrests have been made.

<TEXT>
   A doctor who will make a
house call on two cosmonauts headed Monday for a rendezvous with
their Mir space station, accompanied by the first Afghan in orbit
and a veteran of the Soviet space endurance program.
   A rocket carrying the Soyuz-TM 6 capsule blasted off at 8:23
a.m. Moscow time (12:23 a.m. EDT) Monday, and reached orbit about
nine minutes later.
   Aboard the Soyuz spacecraft are Dr. Valery Polyakov; Afghan air
force pilot Abdul Ahad Mohmand, who helped battle Moslem guerrillas
in his homeland; and veteran cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov.
   They will dock Wednesday with the orbiting Mir space station,
where cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov are in the midst
of a space-endurance mission that is to break the 326-day record.
On Dec. 21, Titov, 40, and Manarov, 37, will have been in space one
year.
   Mohmand and Lyakhov will return to Earth after eight days, but
Polyakov, 46, will stay aboard the station to monitor the health of
Titov and Manarov.
   There is no indication Titov and Manarov have suffered any
health problems, and Polyakov apparently just wants to study them
to learn more about the effects of long-term space travel.
   In addition to the house call, Polyakov is serving as a guinea
pig on the mission.
   Polyakov, a specialist in the effects of weightlessness on the
human body, underwent a ``painful and risky operation'' before the
flight to remove some bone marrow from his body, the official news
agency Tass reported. Marrow will also be removed after he returns
to Earth, and the samples will be compared, Tass said.
   Prolonged spaceflight weakens bones, and scientists are trying
to determine how to counteract the depletion. The Soviet manned
space program, more than the American program, is geared toward
long flights in preparation for a mission to Mars, which would take
three years.
   Tass said Polyakov will also study motion sickness, another
troublesome problem of spaceflight.
   Baikonur spokesman Alexander Savokhkon said of the lift-off of
the three-stage rocket and Soyuz capsule went ``totally according
to program, just a normal launch.'' It was shown live on Soviet and
Afghan television.
   Mohmand, 29, is to take part in efforts to identify oil, gas and
other mineral deposits in Afghanistan and to predict runoff of snow
and ice to alleviate a water shortage. He will also use instruments
to try to identify where earthquakes might occur in Afghanistan.
   The flight also has major political significance.
   It comes during the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan,
and is an ideal way for the Kremlin to reassure its ally of
continued support and friendship and boost the prestige of
Afghanistan's pro-Soviet government.
   The government of President Najib is locked in a long war with
anti-Marxist insurgents, and increasingly is being left to fight on
its own as the 100,000 Soviet soldiers withdraw. The Soviet Union
withdrew half the force between May 15-Aug. 15, and the remainder
of the force must be withdrawn by Feb. 15, 1989.
   ``Being a son of my proud people I will carry along not only joy
but also sorrow for my homeland gripped by a fratricidal war,''
Mohmand said in a statement broadcast live from the capsule before
lift-off.
   ``Brothers, stop the war and direct your forces toward building
a durable national peace,'' said Mohmand, who flew 500 combat
missions against the rebels.
   Najib, in a statement carried by Tass, announced that his
country's armed forces would observe a cease-fire during the space
mission. He said the forces will fire only in self-defense and
appealed to the rebels to follow suit.
   Lyakhov, the 47-year-old pilot, is making his third space
flight. He was in space for 175 days in 1979 and a member of a
150-day mission in 1983.
   The three cosmonauts, dressed in their white space suits,
answered questions of foreign journalists briefly before the
flight. An animated Lyakhov answered questions in several languages
before saying ``good-bye'' in English.
   A Soviet photographer was caught trying to sneak onto the bus
taking the cosmonauts to the Yuri Gagarin launch pad, and was
ordered off.

   A state prison escapee turned himself
in Monday after spending a cold, wet night in the woods.
   Sheriff's deputies picked up Gregory Dye at a rural home, where
a couple served him toast and coffee, officials said.
   ``He said he was hungry and wet and tired and got cold at
night,'' Ross County sheriff's Lt. Dave Large said. ``He's a young
boy.''
   Dye, 26, who was serving a 13- to 40-year sentence for
aggravated breaking and entering and grand theft, turned himself in
from the home of Raymond and Eliza Meeker about 7:45 a.m.
   A steady rain fell across most of the state Sunday night and
early Monday as temperatures dipped into the 50s.
   Mrs. Meeker said Dye approached her home and asked to use her
telephone.
   ``I was out on the porch sweeping. I thought he was a school kid
whose car was broken down,'' she said. ``I didn't know he was an
escapee.
   ``He said he wanted to turn himself in.''
   Dye and William Shoemaker, 36, scaled a fence topped with coils
of razor wire at the medium-security Ross Correctional Institution
near Chillicothe on Sunday morning, said prison spokeswoman Sandy
Price.
   Shoemaker, who was serving a life sentence for aggravated
murder, was recaptured a short time later about one-fourth of a
mile from the prison, Ms. Price said.

   Actor Patrick Swayze, who starred in last
year's hit ``Dirty Dancing,'' is making a new movie about a feud
between a Kentucky family and Chicago mobsters.
   Swayze plays a Chicago policeman who joins his Appalachian
family in exacting vengeance from gangsters responsible for the
murder of his brother.
   Hardburly, a former coal camp in eastern Perry County, was one
of several locations the 70-member team from Lorimar Pictures Inc.
descended upon last week.
   In Jackson, enthusiastic crowds watched the production team whip
up billows of smoke for a scene in which Swayze boards a train for
Chicago.
   The production team and its members also made local merchants
happy, spending $500,000 to $1 million, said Bert Harberson, an
economic development representative with the Kentucky Film Office.
   The crew plans to finish filming in Kentucky this week before it
departs for 10 weeks of production in Chicago, Harberson said.

   Officials of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, having been burned before, decided Monday not
to announce a date for the resumption of space shuttle flights
until mid-September.
   ``They decided to wait until after the flight readiness review
on Sept. 13-14 to set a date,'' said Jim Kast, a NASA spokesman. He
said officials still hoped for a launch before the end of September.
   NASA had scheduled the launch for five different dates
previously, beginning with July 15, 1987. The subsequent dates were
Feb. 18, June 2, Aug. 4 and Aug. 31, but each time major problems
intervened.
   Both NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher and the head of the
shuttle program, Richard Truly, are on vacation and did not attend
Monday's senior staff meeting.
   The flight readiness review, which usually precedes a launch by
two weeks, addresses all aspects of flight preparation, detailed
flight plans and scheduled crew activities. It is a major milestone
in clearing a shuttle for flight.

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Monday it has given
final approval to an agreement with Texaco Corp. calling for $1.25
billion in payments to the government over 5{ years to settle
accusations of overcharging for price-controlled crude oil.
   The settlement, details of which were announced in February, is
the second largest in the government's long campaign to recover
overcharges in the years from 1973 to 1981, when crude oil was
subject to price controls.
   Only $2.1 billion paid by Exxon Corp. was larger. With the
Texaco payment, the government will have recovered more than $7
billion.
   The government originally sought $2.1 billion from Texaco on
similar grounds: that, like Exxon, Texaco had pumped oil from old
wellls under price controls and sold it at a higher price from
newly drilled wells exempt from controls.
   Texaco will pay the government $400 million within 30 days, $190
million plus interest within 18 months and four annual payments
after that of $165 million plus interest. Details of the interest
calculation were not given.
   The department said about $120 million would be refunded to
buyers of Texaco's refined products, 20 percent of the rest would
be set aside for future claims and the rest split between the
federal government and the states.
   Texaco has said it already has set aside funds to pay the
government and will not have to charge the payments against
earnings.

<TEXT>
   Trustees of the county hospital had to
declare Coca-Cola a unique product to resolve a minor crisis after
patients refused substitutes and kept doctors busy writing
prescriptions for the soft drink.
   The trustees' action last week was the only way around the
county requirement to buy on a strict low-bid system. The
distributor who won the cola contract doesn't carry Coke.
   Before the vote, patients had a choice of Diet Pepsi,
Mississippi Cola and Faygo Cola.
   The demand for Coke began with breakfast. ``For some folks it's
the first thing they have in the morning,'' said Hinds General
Hospital nursing director Rita Wray. ``For some folks it's their
coffee; for others it's that Coke.''
   Wray said some patients insist Coca-Cola is better than
medication for nausea.
   ``For some reason, if you give them any other carbonated
beverage, whether it's in their minds or in the formulation
somehow, it just doesn't do the trick,'' Wray said.
   ``I thought it was a little bit silly, but I did it anyway
because I want my patients to be happy,'' said Dr. Gerry Ann
Houston.
   Wray said that was the reaction of most staff physicians. ``They
think, whatever the patient wants and will make him feel better,
we'll do itraq treaty which sets
the border down the middle of the 120-mile Shatt-al-Arab, formed by
the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   Iraq, which claims sovereignty over the waterway, says the
treaty has lapsed because of alleged Iranian violations.
   Iran has said a treaty cannot be renounced by one side only, and
has charged Iraq by undermining the talks with its stance.
   Resolution of the issue seems key to agreement on a troop
withdrawal to international borders, one of the points listed in a
July 20, 1987 U.N. cease-fire resolution that forms the basis of
the current peace talks.
   Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Saadoun Hamadi on Sunday
reaffirmed his country's claim in a toughly worded statement that
cast doubt on progress at the talks.
   Aziz was also asked to respond to accusations Monday by Massoud
Barzani, a leader of Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas, that Iraqi forces
have injured and killed Kurdish refugees in daily chemical bomb
attacks this month.
   ``I prefer not to comment on that,'' he said. ``That is a matter
of the past, and I like to concentrate on the future.''

   A former housing director pleaded guilty Monday
to three counts in an indictment accusing him of pocketing
illegally high rent from poor tenants.
   Robert F. Sumbry, 44, pleaded guilty to making false documents
as a landlord in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development's Section 8 assistance program, U.S. Attorney Robert
Barr said.
   Sumbry was indicted in April on 50 counts charging he used phony
contracts with the Atlanta Housing Authority to hide his plan.
   Sumbry collected rent above what tenants were supposed to pay
under official contracts and leases, according to the charges.
Section 8 is a federal housing subsidy program.
   Sumbry, appointed city housing chief in 1985, had been nominated
by Mayor Andrew Young for another term last year before the
allegations surfaced. Sumbry quit before his renomination could be
voted on.
   He faces up to five years and a $250,000 fine on each count.
Sentencing is scheduled Nov. 2.

   President Reagan prepared messages
of condolence Monday for the families of those killed and injured
in the West German air-show tragedy, as his spokesman noted the
accident underscores the need for ``vigilance and safety'' at such
events.
   ``We are eeply saddened by the tragic accident which occurred at
Ramstein Air Base yesterday in West Germany,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in California with the vacationing
President Reagan, said in his first official comment on the
accident.
   ``We extend our sympathies to the families of those killed and
injured in the crash.''
   The spokesman said Reagan was sending messages of condolence
``to the German people and others affected by the tragedy.''
   Three Italian fighter jets collided during an aerobatic
exhibition at the show on the U.S.-operated base. One slammed into
a crowd and exploded in a fireball, killing at least 45 people, and
about 500 others were injured, including dozens who were critically
burned by jet fuel.
   Asked if the government is rethinking its position on sponsoring
such air shows, Fitzwater said he could not pass judgment, given
that all the details are not yet known and an investigation has
just begun.
   He said America has ``a long tradition'' of air shows, both
military and private.
   ``We're reluctant to pass judgment on this episode or on air
shows in general,'' he said, adding, ``It certainly does, however,
emphasize the need for vigilance and safety.''
   He noted that while the West Germans have indicated they will
halt such shows, but the administration had not yet made any such
determination.
   In answer to a question, Fitzwater said he wasn't aware of
changes in North Atlantic Treaty Organization training flights
because of the low-altitude crash.
   He said the U.S. government was assisting the Italian government
in investigating the cause of the accident, and he noted that a
team from the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, was
en route to assist in caring for the injured, particularly the burn
victims.

   Using Medicaid computer data to identify
pharmacies selling unusual amounts of controlled substances could
help investigators in the battle against illicit drugs, according
to a congressional report.
   ``It's an astoundingly simple concept, despite the complexity of
the computer system,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who
released the General Accounting Office study late Monday. ``Locate
the drugstores selling the highest percentage of controlled
substances to Medicaid `patients' and you might also be finding the
crooked drugstores and the doctors purposely making illegal
prescriptions.''
   Aside from drugs, such as heroin, which are unlawful under any
circumstances, controlled substances include many other drugs which
be legally prescribed but pose various risks of physical or
psychological harm through abuse. Morphine, methadone, cocaine,
aspirin with codeine, phenobarbital, Valium and Darvon are among
examples.
   Except in small states, Medicaid agencies are required to have a
Medicaid Management Information System which contains data on
recipients, physicians and pharmacies, according to the GAO report.
Accounting Office. While separate statistics aren't collected on
controlled drug transactions, GAO found that ``data contained in
the MMIS's can be manipulated to produce reports that may be useful
in the identification of providers who may be diverting controlled
substances.''
   The GAO said MMIS data could be helpful in spotting controlled
substance prescription abuses within the Medicaid program through
closer analysis of the data and sharing the information with law
enforcement agencies.
   For example, GAO auditors analyzed all pharmacies in New York
where 20 percent or more of their Medicaid claims in 1986 involved
controlled substances. They found 11 drugstores that were
substantially above statewide average for business involving
controlled substances. Of those, seven were disqualified from
Medicaid in 1987.
   The GAO was careful to note, however, the a higher-than-average
level of controlled substance sales is not necessarily an abuse of
the program.
   The report recommended that the Health and Human Services
secretary, in consultation with the Department of Justice, test the
usefulness and cost of analyzing and providing MMIS controlled
substances data to law enforcement, regulatory and licensing
agencies.
   Rangel, who is chairman of the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he would hold a hearing early in
the next Congress on the feasibility of nationwide use of MMIS data
to spot controlled substance abuses.

<HEAD>Anglican Bishop Emissary says Iran Wants Hostages Freed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran wants foreign hostages in Lebanon
freed but when it might happen is not clear, a Church of England
emissary said Monday.
   Bishop John Brown said he was in Beirut to investigate the fate
of four missing Iranians so Tehran would use its influence with
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists who hold foreign captives.
   ``The impression one gets very much is that the Iranians are
very anxious to have the hostages situation taken right off their
agenda,'' said Brown, who is the Anglican bishop of Cyprus, based
in Nicosia.
   Eighteen foreigners now are held in Lebanon, among them nine
Americans and three Britons. They include Anglican church envoy
Terry Waite and Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is
the foreign hostage held longest.
   Asked whether Waite and the others would be freed soon, the
bishop said: ``I have no feeling about the timing of it. I feel he
(Waite) will be released, but I have no knowledge of the timing.''
   Brown arrived Sunday from Iran on his second visit to Lebanon in
a month as representative of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, spiritual head of the Church of England and leader of the
world's Anglicans. He spoke in a telephone interview with The AP.
   On Sunday, Brown spent an hour with Patriarch Mar Nasrallah
Butros Sfeir, spiritual head of Lebanon's Maronite Catholics, the
main Christian sect.
   ``When I came the first time a month ago I was asking questions
about four Iranian hostages,'' Brown said. ``This time I really
came back to ask the same people, especially the Maronite
leadership, if there are any answers.''
   The bishop said he had some leads, but would not elaborate.
   He seeks information on four Iranians who disappeared while
driving in the Christian heartland north of Beirut after Israel's
1982 invasion of Lebanon: Revolutionary Guards commander Ahmad
Motevaselian, Charge d'Affaires Mohsen Musavi; Kazem Akhavan of
Iran's official news agency, and their driver, a Lebanese with an
Iranian passport.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's parliament and its
military commander, has promised to help free British hostages if
the Church of England learns the fate of the missing Iranians.
   ``I would like to know from the Christian elements in Beirut
whether or not there are any Iranian hostages alive at all,'' Brown
said. ``This would be an enormous help for us.''
   Brown would not say whether he would travel to Moslem west
Beirut to talk with Moslem leaders about the chances of getting
hostages freed.
   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving a west
Beirut hotel for a meeting with captors of American hostages
Anderson, 40, and Thomas Sutherland, 56. No group has taken
responsibility for his abduction.
   Sutherland was acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut when he was seized June 9, 1985. He and
Anderson are held by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, a group of
Shiite zealots loyal to Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Journalists John McCarthy and Alec Collett are the other British
hostages.
   McCarthy, 31, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, and no group has
claimed responsibility.
   Collett, 66, was abducted March 25, 1985, and responsibility was
taken by the Revolutionary Organization of Socialist Moslems, which
is believed linked to the Palestinian terrorist group of Abu Nidal.
   The group claimed April 23, 1986, that it hanged Collett in
retaliation for British support of the U.S. air raids on Libya
eight days earlier, but no body has been found.
   Brian Keenan, a 37-year-old American University of Beirut
professor abducted April 11, 1986, is Irish but also carries a
British passport.

<HEAD>EPA Announces Anti-Pollution Construction for Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday it is banning construction of new facilities in greater Los
Angeles that pose a major air pollution threat, a ban that could be
extended to a dozen other U.S. cities this fall.
   The EPA is legally required to move against Los Angeles because
an eight-month moratorium on pollution penalties expires at
midnight Tuesday. Congress imposed the moratorium last December to
give itself more time to revise and clarify the Clean Air Act.
   But negotiations over revising the law are stalled by
disagreements over acid rain and other issues, and legislators hold
out little hope of resolving the impasse before Congress adjourns
sometime in October for election campaigning.
   The EPA's construction ban applies only to facilities that
annually produce more than 100 tons of carbon monoxide or volatile
compounds like gasoline that form ozone, a major component of smog
which causes lung damage.
   Oil refineries, paint shops at auto assembly plants or large
printing plants might emit that much ozone-causing pollution, but
none is planned in the Los Angeles area.
   A representative of state air pollution officers said the EPA's
action was little more than ``a paper tiger.'' California official
James Lents said it would have no immediate impact on his state,
whose regulations already forbid construction of facilities
emitting more than a few tons of pollutants annually.
   But Lents, executive officer of California's South Coast Air
Quality Management District, said it might be harder to build
needed sewage treatment plants if the ban continues for very long.
   In announcing the ban, EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas renewed
his appeal for Congress to provide guidance on dealing with the 107
cities or other areas that failed to meet federal air quality
standards last year for ozone, carbon monoxide or both. The 107
areas cover about one-third of the U.S. population.
   Thomas said if Congress fails to act again this year, the result
could be ``many more sanctions on areas as well as mandatory
federal pollution plans and litigation, which will only further
delay reaching the goal we all want _ clean air.''
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, says existing law is not silent on the issue, as Thomas
contends, and that all 107 areas should be penalized.
   Decisions on similar construction bans are pending for Ventura
County, Calif., and for the Indiana and Illinois suburbs of Chicago.
   Before the end of the year, the EPA expects to adopt a policy
requiring areas not meeting pollution standards to demonstrate
steady progress, with a goal of an average 3 percent reduction in
pollution concentrations annually, apart from any nationwide
reductions.
   When it adopts that policy, the agency will decide whether to
impose construction bans at Denver, Reno, Nev.; Bakersfield,
Sacramento and Fresno, Calif.; East St. Louis, Ill., the Indiana
suburbs of Louisville, Ky.; Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas.
   The agency said Dallas could escape penalties because of new
proposals in its latest air quality plan.
   Denver, Reno and Cleveland fail to meet carbon monoxide
standards. Fresno fails both the carbon monoxide and ozone
standards, and the other areas fall short of meeting ozone
standards.
   Because of its weather and terrain, Los Angeles has by far the
highest ozone concentrations in the country. Anti-pollution
measures there have long been the strictest in the country.
   The Los Angeles construction ban already has been ordered by the
courts as a result of a successful environmentalist lawsuit last
January, although the ban was held in abeyance during the
enforcement moratorium voted by Congress.
   States may lose federal highway and sewer funds and air
pollution grants for areas that fail to carry out approved air
quality plans. The EPA interprets existing law as requiring
construction bans in an area whose plans _ like that for Los
Angeles _ fail to show how standards would be met by last Dec. 31.
   ``The construction ban in the past, aside from a few places in
California, has been a paper tiger,'' said William S. Becker,
executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution
Program Administrators who said withholding highway aid is more
effective.
   ``It just seems ludicrous that they are sanctioning the area
that has done the most, and I think EPA recognizes this,'' Becker
said.
   Lents, however, said the EPA's action came as no surprise and
``there is no reason for us to get upset.''
   Lents said his district expects to adopt in December a new plan
calling for 126 new control measures based on existing technology
that will ``set a framework for meeting the standards in 20 years.''
   All clean-air proposals being studied by Congress would extend
compliance deadlines by up to 16 years.

<HEAD>Mexico's Leftist Opposition Faces Survival Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's left-wing opposition, which shocked
the longtime ruling party with its showing in the July national
vote, faces a survival test as a political force in a series of
state elections this fall.
   ``It's possible that there will be a united front of leftist
parties, but the creation of a single party is far away,'' says
Raul Jardon, spokesman for the Mexican Socialist Party, one of four
that joined the Democratic Front.
   The Democratic Front and the rightist National Action Party are
battling the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the
House of Deputies, which is sitting as an electoral college to
certify the election by a Thursday deadline.
   The opposition parties claim the PRI won both the presidential
election and many house seats by fraud.
   The Democratic Front was a disparate group that joined in
opposition to the PRI for the July 6 elections. Along with the
Mexican Socialist Party, it includes the Authentic Mexican
Revolutionary Party, the Popular Socialist Party and the Cardenist
Front.
   The parties support a larger government role in the economy and
a moratorium on payments of Mexico's $104 billion foreign debt, but
beyond that their roots and interests differ.
   The Cardenas Front was created by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former
PRI state governor and senator, and includes many former members of
the PRI, especially from the PRI's so-called Democratic Current,
which sought a party primary before the presidential election.
   The Authentic Revolutionary Party was founded in 1954 by
militarist members of the PRI who were dissatisfied with their
marginal position in the party.
   The Popular Socialist Party was founded in 1929 and advocates
pushing the government gradually toward socialism.
   The Mexican Socialist Party, last to join the front, includes
what was once the Mexican Communist Party and has the most radical
agenda. Its presidential candidate, Herberto Castillo, announced
his candidacy but withdrew in favor of Cardenas, who ran as the
candidate of the united left-wing opposition.
   The other candidates were Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who
according to official returns won with 50 percent of the vote _ the
first time a PRI candidate finished under 70 percent in official
tabulations since the party was founded in 1929.
   Cardenas took 31 percent but claims fraud robbed him of victory;
National Action Party candidate Manuel J. Clouthier received 17
percent.
   ``The main challenge facing the Democratic Front is to form a
real political party,'' said a PRI official who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``They got together for the elections, but that was
tactical.''
   PRI doesn't believe the four parties can continue to work
together, party officials said. They also said the opposition's
victory in Mexico City made party members realize they had to work
harder.
   Before the end of the year, that determination will be tested as
11 of Mexico's 31 states have gubernatorial elections. In five
states _ Jalisco, Guanajuato, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo Leon and
Tabasco _ the PRI's winning margins on July 6 were thin.
   The PRI has not lost a governorship since it was founded, but
National Action spokesman Ricardo Garcia Cervantes said the party
hoped to break that string in December in Jalisco, which the PRI
won with a plurality of 42 percent in July.
   ``The Federal Election Commission only gave us eight of the 14
districts (out of 20) that we actually won in the state. If they'd
given us all 14, you would see how strong we really are there,''
said Garcia. ``We're going after the governorship.''
   Jardon said the Democratic Front would run a single candidate
for the governorship in the state of Tabasco, where Cardenas did
well.
   And unity is not evident in Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico,
where municipal elections are due Oct. 2.
   About 550 candidates are registered for the elections, according
to state election commission official Anastasio Reyes Marquez.

<HEAD>Former Democratic Congressman Says Quayle Would Not Be A Good Veep</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic Congressman John
Jenrette said his occasional golfing partner during the 1970s,
Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle, is a strong
candidate but ``wouldn't be a good vice president.''
   Jenrette, in an interview with The Myrtle Beach (S.C.) Sun News,
questioned whether the campaign of GOP nominee George Bush
conducted a thorough check of Quayle's background. The Indiana
senator's service in the National Guard at the height of the
Vietnam War has created a controversy for the Republican ticket.
   ``The problems should have been found and treated.'' Jenrette
said.
   The former congressman said Quayle has hurt himself more than
any of the news reports about him because of ``the way he has
acted, not having a straight answer ready.''
   ``George Bush is famous for having a silver foot in his mouth,''
the Democrat said. ``You have two people making these mistakes now.
I fear that there's a lot more to come. A lot of peoples' memories
will be jogged by the things that seemed little at the time. It
will bring together an image and there'll be more people bantering,
wanting to get a piece of the action, be a Quayle killer.''
   The 52-year-old Jenrette said he invited Quayle on several
golfing outings in South Carolina during the 1970s but has not
talked to the Indiana senator for ``five or six years.''
   ``George Bush thought he was getting a stuffed shirt just like
himself but he didn't,'' Jenrette told the newspaper. ``Dan's been
down here a number of times and always had a good time. I would
rather have someone who's done something and learned what life's
all about than someone who's been sheltered.''
   Quayle is ``a good vice presidential candidate though he
wouldn't be a good vice president,'' he said.
   Jenrette served in Congress from 1975-1980, when he narrowly
lost re-election two weeks after being found guilty of accepting a
bribe. His ex-wife, Rita Jenrette, made national headlines with a
book about her husband's alcoholism and infidelity.

   The Justice Department said today it will not
appeal a federal court decision that allowed the Palestine
Liberation Organization mission at the United Nations in New York
to remain open.
   The department said in a statement that the ``decision was based
on a determination that, on balance, the interests of the United
States are best served by not appealing.''
   Congress had sought to force the closing of the PLO mission at
the U.N. on the grounds that the PLO endorsed terrorism.
   But the State Department objected on the grounds that closing
the office would violate the U.N. Headquarters Agreement. The U.N.
also objected.
   On June 29, U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Palmieri accepted
that view. The Justice Department said the Anti-Terrorism Act of
1987 did not require closing the PLO office in New York because
Congress ``did not clearly indicate its intent on the face of the
statute to violate U.S. obligations under the U.N. Headquarters
Agreement.''
   The Justice Department said the administration normally appeals
adverse federal court decisions of this kind, ``but it was decided,
in the light of foreign policy considerations, including the U.S.
role as host to the U.N. organization, not to appeal in this
instance.''
   ``If that is the true position of the Justice Department, they
are now moving in line with international law and the commitment of
the host country under the Headquarters Agreement to honor the
agreement, and not to violate it,'' said Riyad H. Mansour, the
PLO's charge d'affaires, when asked about the ruling at U.N.
headquarters in New York.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition they not be named, said
the Justice Department had lobbied hard to pursue an appeal, but
the State Department view prevailed in the end.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., had written a letter last week to
White House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein recommending the
decision be appealed.
   ``At issue is the question of who determines the sovereign
powers of the United States _ the Congress and the president
through the constitutional process, or the United Nations and a
single District Court judge in New York,'' he said.
   Helms and Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said if the court ruling
stands, American ability to control access of foreign nationals to
the United States would be weakened.
   The department said it will continue to oppose efforts to
re-open the PLO office in Washington, which is not covered by the
U.N. agreement.

   Californians are split evenly between the
presidential candidates, with 10 percent undecided, according to a
new poll.
   Results of the polling of 1,360 registered voters showed 44
percent of those asked supporting Democrat Michael Dukakis and 43
percent favoring Republican George Bush. That difference, well
within the poll's 2.7 margin of error, puts the race at a dead heat.
   The survey was conducted Wednesday through Saturday by Teichner
Associates, Inc. for the San Francisco Examiner and KRON-TV.
   California offers the nation's largest cache of electoral votes

   A homeless protester who fired cannon
blasts and threatened to destroy historic Fort Vancouver gave up
his occupation of the log building today in exchange for a chance
to talk to reporters, authorities said.
   The protester, who gave his name as Ken Rose, 40, apparently
acted alone.
   Police had surrounded the fort after the man scaled the 15-foot
walls and left a note protesting treatment of the homeless and
Vietnam veterans.
   At least four explosions came from the log structure, including
at least two from replicas of cannons, said Police Capt. Ray
Anderson. He said the cannons appeared to have been loaded only
with black powder and the explosions were little more than puffs of
smoke.
   No injuries were reported, and Anderson said there were no
indications of damage.
   Rose said he most recently lived in the Tillamook, Ore., area
and was recently treated in the Veterans Administration hospital in
Portland, Ore., for post-traumatic stress syndrome and alcoholism.
He said he was not drinking during the incident.
   Before he was arrested and taken away, Rose told reporters he
entered the reconstructed stockade to draw attention to the plight
of Vietnam veterans. He said he gave himself up on the condition he
could speak to the press.
   Earlier, he had asked to speak to a Catholic priest, a
psychiatrist or psychologist from the Portland, Ore., Veterans
Adminstration hospital, and to Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member of
the House Veterans Affairs Committee who is visiting the state.
   A note left outside the 4{-acre fort said it was ``taken by
Vietnam veterans at 4:30 a.m.,'' but Anderson and others said there
was no evidence more than one person was involved.
   ``Any attempts to retake the fort will result in the destruction
of the fort,'' the note said.
   An FBI negotiator was on the scene, Anderson said. The FBI had
jurisdiction because the site is a federal landmark.
   The original fort was built in the early 1800s, but deteriorated
later in the 19th century. The structure was rebuilt after the fort
was named a historic site in 1961. The stockade was used as a fur
trading post from 1825 to 1849.

<HEAD>Five Dead in Head-on Train Crash in Austria</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two trains collided head-on in western
Austria near the West German border, killing five people and
injuring 52, authorities said.
   The general director of the Austrian Railroad Authority,
Heinrich Uebleis, said human error probably caused the accident,
the worst in Austria in 17 years.
   The accident at 12:37 p.m. on an overpass outside the Wolfurt
train station in the western province of Vorarlberg involved a
train en route to West Germany from Vienna and an express train
headed for the Alpine city of Innsbruck from the West German border
town of Lindau, said a spokesman for the Austrian Railroad
Authority.
   Guntram Fonach, a civilian rescue official in the district of
Laudrach, where the accident occured, said five people were killed
and 52 injured. He said 19 were seriously hurt and had to be taken
to hospital.
   The trains were moving along the same track, when they collided,
crushing one car and derailing two others. No debris fell to the
road below.
   A passenger interviewed by Austrian TV said there was no warning.
   ``Nothing. There was a crash and then it was over. Nothing,''
she said.
   A man sitting on a blanket in the grass near the wreck said:
``It happened so fast.''
   Ernst Tscherett of the Railway Authority who was interviewed by
television at the scene, said the accident appeared to have been
caused by human error on the part of the engineer of the train from
West Germany.
   Railroad officials said one track was closed, and trains headed
into Austria had to be transfered to the opposite track. The
express train from West Germany should have stopped outside the
Wolfurt station to wait for a signal to move to the opposite track,
they said.
   However, it continued through the red signal, although it had
slowed and was only traveling at a speed of about 27 mph at impact,
Uebleis said. He said the other train was traveling at about 45 mph.
   ``The technology was in order,'' Uebleis said. ``Human error
seems to exist,'' he said.
   Officials refused to identify the dead and injured.
   Walther Kollerits, of the railway authority said the driver of
the train from Vienna was among the dead, as was a 67-year-old
woman. He said there were many West Germans on the trains, but
refused to give the nationality of the dead or injured.
   The tracks were closed to traffic, and international trains were
being rerouted via Switzerland or West Germany, he said.
   Firefighters and railway workers began clearing the wreckage
from the track and searching for any passengers who might be
trapped in the debris.

   While the U.S. military's aerobatic stunt
teams have suffered fatal accidents in the past, they have never
killed a spectator and routinely face scrutiny from a federal
agency that limits the maneuvers they perform.
   ``We control the airspace, so it is up to us to make sure that
all operations in that airspace are conducted properly and
safely,'' John Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said Monday.
   ``The (Air Force) Thunderbirds and the (Navy) Blue Angels put
their shows together, but we decide on a show-by-show basis whether
there is airspace to accomodate the maneuvers safely.''
   Leyden and Defense Department officials declined to speculate on
the cause of a spectacular crash Sunday during an air show at the
U.S.-operated Ramstein Air Base in West Germany. Three Italian air
force jets collided during a high-speed manuever and one fell into
the crowd, killing at least 45 people and injuring about 500.
   According to eyewitness accounts, however, the Italian air force
team's 10 jets were flying about 180 feet off the ground and
intersecting over the field from three different directions when
the accident occurred. The maneuver put some of the jets on a
course directly toward the crowd.
   ``We wouldn't allow aerobatic maneuvers above the crowd,'' said
Leyden. ``Our minimum flight line for jets is 1,500 feet from the
crowd, and we require all maneuvers be performed along that line.''
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters, ``We're reluctant to pass judgment on this episode
or on air shows in general. It certainly does, however, emphasize
the need for vigilance and safety.''
   Tom Poberezny, an official with the Experimental Aircraft
Association who is also a stunt pilot with the civilian Flying
Eagles team, said the FAA rules made an accident like the one in
West Germany unlikely here.
   Indeed, the Italian Freece Tricolori team involved in Sunday's
crash was required to alter its flying routine at the EAA's 1986
airshow to keep the stunt pilots from flying toward the crowd,
Poberezny said.
   ``Overall, the safety record for air shows in this country is
really outstanding,'' said Leyden, adding that more than 200 such
shows take place annually.
   The Blue Angels and Thunderbirds have appeared at many of those
shows for decades.
   The Blue Angels were formed in 1946 and have performed before
more than 200 million people. The Thunderbirds were organized in
1953 and have appeared before more than 170 million.
   The season for both teams normally begins in March and extends
to mid-November, featuring anywhere from 70 to 90 performances.
   Both teams have known good times and bad. Last year, the Blue
Angels suffered a training accident in El Centro, Calif., that
destroyed a plane, although no one was killed. In July 1985,
however, a pilot was killed during a Blue Angel demonstration over
Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   The last fatal accident involving the Thunderbirds _ and the
worst in their history _ occurred on Jan. 18, 1982, during a
practice session in Nevada. Four pilots died as a team followed its
leader into the ground.
   All told, the Blue Angels have lost 22 pilots and the
Thunderbirds have lost 19, the services say.
   ``Neither we nor the Blue Angels have ever harmed a spectator,
and that shows how well thought out our maneuvers are and our
compliance with the FAA guidelines,'' said Lt. Col. Steve Trent,
leader of the Thunderbirds.
   ``Crowd safety is our No. 1 priority. We do not perform any
maneuver that does not ensure proper lateral and vertical
separation from the crowd.''
   Trent said the Air Force does not allow any crossing maneuver
that puts formations of planes against each other _ only individual
planes _ and that any such crosses must be performed beyond the end
of the crowd.
   Pentagon officials consider the teams as great for recruiting
and an important tool for showing the public what its tax dollars
are buying.
   The Navy, for example, determined last year that 63 percent of
the students entering Navy flight school had seen at least one Blue
Angels performance and that of those, almost 40 percent cited the
team as a direct influence on their decision to join the military.
   Both teams also fly the latest in front-line jet fighters _ the
Navy's F-A-18 and the Air Force's F-16.

<HEAD>Chile's Military Commanders Meet Tuesday To Pick Presidential
Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Gen. Augusto Pinochet and the
other military commanders meet Tuesday to pick a nominee for an
October presidential referendum that could extend Pinochet's period
of rule to 1997.
   Pinochet, 72, who has ruled Chile since a 1973 coup, appears
virtually assured of the nomination. Pro-Pinochet groups have
planned a celebration rally Tuesday night in front of the
government palace.
   Pinochet, who commands the army, navy chief Adm. Jose Merino,
air force leader Gen. Fernando Matthei and national police director
Gen. Rodolfo Stange are scheduled to meet at midday Tuesday in
strict privacy at the Defense Ministry building to decide on a
nominee.
   The meeting of the military commanders comes amid an
intensifying political campaign by government backers as well as
opponents, and a last-minute wave of voter registration.
   The 1980 constitution, which outlines a phased return to
democratic rule, gives the commanders 48 hours to make a unanimous
choice. Government officials, however, say they expect the session
to conclude within hours and have made arrangements for the
announcement ceremony later Tuesday.
   If the commanders are unable to reach a unanimous decision
within 48 hours, the constitution calls for nomination by majority
decision of an eight-man National Security Council that includes
Pinochet, the other commanders and four other top officials, three
of whom were appointed by Pinochet.
   No exact date has been announced for the referendum, but it is
expected to disclosed Tuesday along with the candidate. If a
majority of voters cast ``yes'' ballots in the referendum, the
nominee will begin an eight-year term March 11. If a majority
reject him, an open election will be held in 1990.
   Once the candidate is announced, registration of voters will
halt. Since February, more than 7 million of the country's 8
million eligible voters have registered.
   On Monday, long lines of would-be voters were lined up at
registration centers to beat the deadline. As they did on Friday,
authorities were expected to extend the hours for registration so
that people would not be turned away.
   Both pro- and anti-government groups have intensified their
publicity campaigns in connection with the referendum.
   Advertisements directly urging a ``yes'' vote were being aired
regularly on television, radio and in newspapers and magazines. The
ads warned that, if the candidate is rejected, Chile would return
to the social and economic chaos of the early 1970s when a Marxist,
Salvador Allende, was president.
   Allende's elected government was toppled in the bloody 1973 coup
led by Pinochet. He died in the takeover.
   A 16-party coalition of opposition groups was busy planning a
downtown rally for Sunday, anticipating that tens of thousands of
people would attend. They also began a new publicity campaign, with
ads recalling Pinochet's promise several years back that he would
not run again for president.
   ``No more lies,'' the ads declared.

   A teen-ager who drowned in Lake Conroe was

   Leif Eric Harris, 18, of Porter, drowned Sunday after he and
companion Johnny Slaughter, 17, swam to a platform in the water 200
feet from the shore.
   As they were returning, Harris began to yell, but because he had
been pretending to drown earlier in the day, no attention was paid

   Sheriff's divers found Harris' body later Sunday, Morison said.

   Hundreds of clerical and technical workers at
New York University went on strike Monday, the first day of fall
registration, over pay parity with other employees at the nation's
largest private university.
   Union members set up picket lines outside the main building
Monday morning, but university spokesman Howard L. Levine said the
strikers had little effect and registration was ``going very
smoothly.''
   The 1,500-member union comprises primarily women who work as
secretaries, receptionists and in the university's libraries, mail
rooms and laboratories.
   Shelley Ettinger, a spokeswoman for Local 3882 of the American
Federation of Teachers, said union members' average yearly salary
was $17,300, about $2,000 a year less than other university workers
including elevator operators, porters and security guards.
   No new talks were scheduled.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil has been found beneath a Paris suburb and
officials with the state-controlled oil company said Monday they
were encouraged by the success of their first wildcat well in the
capital.
   Exploratory drilling began three weeks ago on a permit granted
to the company, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, for the
Paris-Isle-de-France region.
   ``After the seismic tests we did, we figured we would find
something,'' said Thomas Saunders, a spokesman for the oil company.
``But we thought there was maybe one chance out of six or seven.
Everybody's very pleased, of course, that we found something the
first time.''
   Elf Aquitaine holds a 50 percent share of the permit with
Total-Compagnie Francaises des Petroles owning 35 percent and
British Petroleum France holding the rest. The permit was awarded
in December 1985.
   The Elf-Total-BP joint venture has already spent $11.6 million
on the permit to drill, most of it for seismic tests, said Elf's
chief of French operations, Bruno Weymuller.
   ``It was important to find oil to show that we are right to be
drilling in the region,'' said Patrick Oberto, director of
exploration for BP France.
   The Paris Basin, which contains 6.36 million barrels of known
oil reserves, 48 operating wells and about 600 exploratory wells,
has a discovery rate of 1 in 12 wells. The Paris Basin extends over
50,000 square miles from Paris east to West Germany.
   The first Paris well produced oil with small quantities of water
during a test at a depth of 1,972 yards. The well was drilled in
the suburb of Ivry, on the left bank of the Seine River about 500
yards from the elevated freeway that encircles Paris.
   Ivry 101 was drilled at an angle and the oil-bearing rock was
struck under an apartment building across the Seine in the adjacent
suburb of Alfortville, the company said.
   Saunders said the oil was found Friday and that tests on Sunday
confirmed oil was present in the rock. More tests will be conducted
over the next 10 days to determine the quality of the oil and the
extent of the find.
   ``We haven't found a lagoon of oil, this isn't Texas. It is all
impregnated in stone and we need to figure out if it will be
econmically feasible to produce it,'' Saunders said.
   About 10 million people live in the 587 square miles covered by
the permit.
   Ivry 101 is the first of several exploratory wells to be drilled
in the suburbs to the north, south and east of Paris. About 60
workers remain at the site and drilling continues around the clock,
the company said.

<HEAD>O-Ring Maker Takes Steps To Guard Against Sabotage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the FBI and NASA investigated cuts
in some space shuttle booster O-rings, the manufacturer of the
critical rocket seals said Monday it has taken measures to guard
against sabotage.
   Both seal maker HydraPak and rocket maker Morton Thiokol Inc.,
which contracts with the company for the rubber-like O-rings, said
none of the damaged seals had been shipped to, or received by,
Morton Thiokol.
   James Dockstader, HydraPak vice president of production, said
Monday a ``very small number'' of O-rings that appeared to have
been deliberately cut were found by the company in June. The FBI,
NASA and Morton Thiokol were immediately notified, he said.
   ``We have taken steps to correct that problem and we don't
expect that problem to recur,'' Dockstader said.
   He refused to specify the measures taken, but didn't rule out
improving security at the company's operations in West Jordan,
about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City.
   ``We had good security before this happened,'' Dockstader said.
``(But) we're always looking at ways to improve our security.''
   Former HydraPak inspector Cathy Crocker has said she was forced
to resign not long after she discovered three slashed O-rings in
May. Management was unable to determine who was responsible, she
said.
   Dockstader said he could not discuss details of confidential
personnel actions, but added: ``We have not discharged anyone
relative to this investigation, I'll put it that way.''
   However, he would not say whether any employees had been
disciplined.
   FBI Special Agent Cal Clegg said his office's investigation of
the incidents was continuing, but he could not say how far the
probe was from being completed. Clegg confirmed that the
possibility of sabotage was being explored.
   NASA Inspector General Bill Colvin confirmed that ``sabotage is
still part of the investigation,'' but would not comment on other
aspects of the case _ including the possibility of action against
HydraPak.
   Improvements to the shuttle booster O-ring has been a major
focus of Morton Thiokol's 2{-year effort to redesign the rocket
blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster.
   A presidential commission found that an O-ring, located in a
Challenger booster rocket field joint, allowed super-hot gases to
escape and ignite the shuttle's exterior fuel tank during launch.
Seven astronauts died in the subsequent explosion that destroyed
the spacecraft.
   On Aug. 18, Morton Thiokol culminated its effort to overhaul the
booster with an apparently successful test-firing of its redesigned
rocket at the company's northern Utah plant 25 miles west of
Brigham City.
   The $20 million, two-minute firing was the fifth and final
qualifying test needed before the 126-foot-long booster can be
cleared for flight.
   The nation's manned space flight program has been grounded since
the Challenger accident. NASA has said Discovery will be launched
in late September of early October.

   Two masked men hijacked a small

Austria, but he returned after the two got off the aircraft, a
government news agency reported.
   In Austria, a witness told police he saw a red plane with
Czechoslovak markings land on a field in a village near
Gross-Russbach in Lower Austria.
   Police said the two Czechoslovak citizens had not reported to
authorities and their whereabouts were not known.
   The Czechoslovak news agency CTK said the hijack took place at
an airport in Holic, about 40 miles north of Bratislava, capital of
Slovakia.
   ``Two unknown masked men forced the pilot to fly across the
border into Austria, where the plane landed in a field,'' CTK said,
without specifying the type of aircraft involved. ``Immediately
after both hijackers left the plane, the pilot took off again and
returned to Czechoslovakia.''

   The nation's Anglican church has resumed
the sharing of the communion chalice of wine, a practice abandoned
10 months ago because of the fear of AIDS, state radio announced
Monday.
   Bishop Yona Okoth, head of the Church of Uganda, told worshipers
Sunday at the Trinity Church in Kampala that medical evidence
showed AIDS cannot be transmitted through sharing the chalice,
Radio Uganda reported.
   Since November, Anglican worshipers in Uganda had pieces of
bread dipped in wine during the holy communion instead of the usual
placing of bread in the mouth before sipping wine from a communal
chalice held by a clergyman.
   Uganda, among the most candid of African nations about the
disease's spread, had reported more than 5,000 cases of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome as of June. The virus destroys the
body's immune system and is carried in blood and other bodily
fluids.
   AIDS is most commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by
shared, contaminated drug needles. It also can be transmitted from
an infected mother to her child before or at birth.

<HEAD>VA Has Taken 13,000 Beds Out of Service, House Panel Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Administration has taken more
than 13,000 beds at VA hospitals out of service while telling
Congress that budget cuts have not hurt service, the House Veterans
Affairs Committee charged Monday.
   ``It is amazing the dramatic contrast between what we are
learning from the field and what we are told officially'' by VA
officials in Washington, said Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss.,
chairman of the panel.
   The committee will hold a hearing on the matter Sept. 7 after
Congress returns from its August recess.
   Lula Tyler, a VA spokeswoman, declined to respond to
Montgomery's statements because she said she hadn't seen the
committee's survey.
   Committee staff members studied the nation's VA hospitals in the
wake of assurances by VA Administrator Thomas Turnage that the
agency wasn't ``making compromises'' because of budget cuts.
   The nation's 172 VA hospitals had an average of 73,588 beds
available at the end of June, the committee found. The review also
disclosed that 13,039 beds were not available for a variety of
reasons, including renovation or construction projects, lack of
money or staff shortages.
   But Victor Raymond, a spokesman for the committee, said the
staff was unable to determine exactly how many beds are available
to veterans on an average day. He also said he did not know if any
veterans had been denied care because beds were not available.
   As a result, the number of veterans being denied treatment is
unclear, Montgomery said. The VA offers medical care for the many
of nation's 28 million military veterans.
   Montgomery said the staff survey found that local VA hospital
directors are being forced to juggle resources to meet daily
operating requirements.
   He claimed that the VA's main office ``is either oblivious to
the problem _ well-insulated from its true magnitude _ or is toeing
the administration line with little regard to its consequences for
American's veterans.''
   In another development, Turnage issued a statement disputing a
report issued Aug. 21 by the House Government Operations Committee
that said the VA made numerous errors in processing disability
claims by veterans. Turnage said the report was ``grossly
misleading.''
   The House committee said applicants filed by veterans who had no
``pull'' were handled rapidly by error-prone managers trying to
earn pay bonuses for meeting production quotas.
   But the Bureau of Veterans Appeals _ which is the court of last
appeal for veterans denied benefits _ ``maintained a list of
congressmen who should be brought to the BVA chairman's attention
if they inquire about an appeal,'' the committee said.
   ``The vast majority of VA claims decisions are accurate and
acceptable to veterans who file them,'' the VA said in response.
``The committee's report is based on an extremely limited overview
of VA claims activity and on isolated anecdotes that hardly
represent either the entire system or quality improvement measures
adopted in recent years.''
   Kenneth Eaton, chairman of the BVA, said the board was not
guilty of bias based on congressional interest in specific cases.
   ``I review various cases after decisions are reached and I do so
only for management purposes,'' Eaton said.
   The House committee said some members of the BVA reviewed cases
at a rate of one every eight minutes. The VA said that finding was
based on ``a flawed statistic computed by a former BVA employee.''
   In fact, the VA said each three-member panel spends an average
of 2.7 hours per decision.

<TEXT>
   George Bush said Monday that Michael Dukakis gives the
impression of being ``against every new weapons system since the
slingshot.'' A newly aggressive Massachusetts governor fired back
that his Republican rival's call for a cut the capital gains tax
amounts to a handout for the wealthy.
   The combatants in an increasingly heated battle for the White
House exchanged barbs as their senior aides prepared to meet in
Washington on Tuesday to open face-to-face negotiations over
campaign debates. Bush has said no debate is likely before Sept.
20, and he added during the day, ``I'm not about to be stampeded''
by Democratic demands for an earlier date.
   Fresh public opinion polls provided a snapshot of what both
parties say will be an unusually close race this fall. Among them
was a survey indicating that Dukakis' once-substantial margin has
been washed away completely in California, the biggest state with
47 electoral votes.
   Bush held a nine percentage point lead in a separate survey in
Missouri, a key swing state, and Dukakis owned an 11-point bulge in
Wisconsin. Both states have 11 electoral votes.
   Bush, who has consistently challenged Dukakis on defense issues,
continued the barrage at a campaign stop in St. Louis.
   He belittled his Democratic opponent for saying the United
States needs anti-tank weapons rather than the MX mobile missile,
adding that both systems are needed for national security.
   ``Sometimes he gives me the impression he's against every new
weapons system since the slingshot,'' the vice president said on a
day that included a tour of a defense plant in Missouri and a visit
to a ROTC program in Tennessee.
   Bush also said his running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, has
absorbed a ``tremendous pounding'' over his National Guard service
and other issues, and has ``emerged to where he will be an asset''
to the GOP ticket.
   He said it ``doesn't bother me a bit'' that he and Quayle differ
on some issues and that the senator seemed unaware in a Boston
Globe interview that the vice president headed a presidential panel
on drug interdiction.
   Quayle and his Democratic counterpart, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
took a day off from campaign traveling.
   Dukakis embarked on a two-day tour of western Massachusetts and
he seemed eager to close the books on the last few weeks _ the
period since the Democratic National Convention during which his
once-solid lead in national public opinion polls turned into a
deficit.
   ``The dog days of August are almost over,'' he said as he
returned Bush's fire on the subjects of crime and drugs and said
there is no need to debate the patriotism of the two candidates.
   At a news conference that was scheduled, canceled and then
rescheduled, Dukakis said he wanted to ask his opponent about the
16,000 furloughs granted to federal prisoners last year, ``some
lasting 45 days and many to convicted drug pushers Mr. Bush says he
wants to execute.''
   Bush has criticized Dukakis for a Massachusetts furlough program
in which a prisoner on a weekend pass raped a woman. The vice
president also favors the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   Dukakis has been the subject of unusual criticism from his own
party in recent weeks for running an insufficiently aggressive
campaign and permitting Bush to seize the offensive. The governor
conceded his campaign message of recent weeks may have been lost in
the ``somewhat extraordinary'' coverage of the Republican National
Convention, the furor over Quayle and unsubstantiated rumors about
himself and his wife Kitty. His news conference was briefly dropped
from his schedule when senior aides said they wanted to force
television coverage of Dukakis' speech.
   In his remarks, Dukakis seemed to reply to Bush's attacks over
his veto of state legislation requiring teachers to lead their
students in the Pledge of Allegiance, a law the state Superme Court
said in an advisory opinion was unconstitutional.
   ``The American people...aren't interested in a debate over which
one of us loves his country the most _ we all love this country.
There should be no debate about that,'' he said.
   Dukakis said he was not going to accept ``Mr. Bush's suggestion
that the way to build opportunity for our citizens is to cut taxes
for the wealthy _ again _ this time a five-year, $40 billion
handout, seventy percent of which would go to those making $200,000
a year or more.''
   Bush has called for cutting the capital gains tax, which is a
levy on investment profits. Dukakis aides said the governor's
estimates came from two publications on the subject.
   Bush and Dukakis made their campaign rounds as their political
allies weighed in from the sidelines.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said the Dukakis campaign was
``on a roll _ downhill'' and the governor ``has virtually become
the Rip Van Winkle of 1988.'' He said GOP chances of taking control
of the Senate have been enhanced as a result.
   Democratic chairman Paul Kirk spoke up on Dukakis' behalf,
saying Bush's campaign ``has been fundamentally a negative campaign
of distortion and deception.'' He said the vice opresident was
using ``transcontinental slurs and smearing tactics'' while seeking
to avoid debates.

<TEXT>
   The aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower
banged into an anchored Spanish coal ship at the entrance to
Hampton Roads harbor Monday on its return home from six months in
the Mediterranean, the Navy said.
   No injuries were reported among the 3,200 sailors aboard the
nuclear-powered carrier or aboard the 893-foot Urduliz.
   ``There was no fire, flooding or fuel spill aboard the ship.
That's the good news,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Michael W. John, a spokesman
for the Atlantic Fleet Naval Air Force. ``About 100 feet of the
starboard of the ship was damaged, about amidship under the
island.''
   The island is the part of the ship's superstructure that rises
three stories above the flight deck on the starboard side.
   John described the damage as scrapes and dents.
   The incident occurred within sight of the Norfolk Naval Station.
   Tom Carpenter, a former Navy helicopter crewman, was watching
the Eisenhower from his sixth floor window of the Hotel Chamberlin,
which overlooks the anchorage.
   ``I was watching the ship through binoculars and it seemed to
get closer and closer to the freighter that was riding on its
moorage. It look like the wind blew the Ike into the freighter.
There was a cloud of debris when they struck,'' he said.
   Carpenter, from Silver Spring, Md., and his wife, Patricia,
watched as the ships hung together for three to five minutes,
before the carrier appeared to pull away under its own power.
   ``When they hit, the sailors were about to man their stations on
the rails. You could see lifeboats and other gear being scraped
off. They waved off two helicopters that were about to land on the
deck,'' he said.
   The Urduliz's forecastle was damaged when the Eisenhower's
overhanging flight deck apparently struck the vessel well above the
waterline, said Capt. L.D. Amory of the Virginia Pilots
Association. The ship, homeported in Bilboa, Spain, was to take on
110,000 tons of coal at the Norfolk coal piers.
   David Host, a spokesman for the ship's agent, T. Parker Host,
said an inspection team boarded the ship. If seaworthy, the Urduliz
was expected to return to Spain for repairs.
   John said the Navy started an investigation into the incident.
The ship is commanded by Capt. Gary Beck of Dearborn, Mich.
   The Eisenhower was in the Mediterrean along with 17 other ships
and 13,000 sailor and Marines in its carrier-battle group.

<HEAD>Cotton Supply May Be Largest In 22 Years</HEAD>

   Prospects for another good cotton crop in 1988
could push the total supply for the coming year to the highest
level in more than two decades, an Agriculture Department report
said Monday.
   Based on Aug. 1 indications, the cotton harvest could be 14.9
million bales, up from 14.8 million bales last year, the
department's Economic Research Service said. The increase would
result from a larger acreage this year, despite a reduction in
per-acre yields.
   In all, counting cotton left over from previous harvests, the
total 1988-89 supply will be about 20.5 million bales, the most
since the 1966-67 season.
   Because domestic and export use is not keeping pace with
production, the U.S. cotton stockpile when the next marketing year
begins on Aug. 1, 1989, could rise to 8.9 million bales from an
estimated carryover of 5.6 million bales this Aug. 1, the report
said.
   Meanwhile, world cotton production in 1988-89 is expected to
rise to nearly 86 million bales, up 7 percent from last season.
Foreign production, at about 71 million bales, is expected to gain
5 million bales, including record crops in India, Greece, Turkey
and Australia.
   World cotton consumption, forecast at nearly 83 million bales,
will about match last season, the report said. Cotton use is
expected to increase primarily among producing countries, while
falling among importers.
   As a result, world cotton stocks are expected to increase nearly
9 percent in 1988-89 to more than 35 million bales by the end of
the season. All of the buildup will occur in the United States,
while foreign inventories are expected to decline 2 percent.
   The report said U.S. cotton ``has not been priced competitively
in world markets for several months'' and that reduced export
sales, along with large crops last year and in 1988 translate into
the rise in inventories and higher costs of operating the
government's support program.
   Thus, to make U.S. cotton more competitive, officials said
several changes were made recently in the the price support
program. One change was in the formula for setting the ``adjusted
world price'' of cotton, which is used in determining in how
producers settle up their price support loans.
   ``These changes in the upland cotton program have lowered the
adjusted world price for base quality cotton as well as coarse
count cotton, and reduced the cost of redeeming cotton under loan
with cash,'' the report said. ``These revisions are expected to
have a significant influence on U.S. export potential for the
remainder of this marketing year.''

   A convicted armed robber who walked away
in 1978 from a work-release program and fled to Maryland, where she
became a successful real estate agent, on Monday received a minimum
one-year sentence.
   ``I never thought it had all just passed,'' Kay Smith, 36, said
after sentencing. She was known as Pamela Rodgers when she was
convicted in the early 1970s for five armed robberies. ``I had
always had it in my mind that it would come to a head. The fear was
always there.''
   Ms. Smith pleaded guilty to fugitive charges in Richland County
Circuit Court before Judge Frank Eppes, who had sentenced her
previously.
   Ms. Smith is to serve the one-year sentence consecutively with
the remaining 4{ years of her armed robbery sentence. Judy
Turnipseed, a spokesperson for the state Department of Probation,
Parole and Pardon Services, said Monday Ms. Smith could be eligible
for parole by April 1990.
   Authorities arrested Ms. Smith on May 10 after being alerted to
her new name and location by her former husband, who has been
convicted of murder in Idaho.
   ``Judge, many people who come before you this week will say
they'll never do anything wrong again, but they still can't stay
out of trouble,'' her attorney, Dick Harpootlian, said. ``She has
beaten the statistics, she has made something of herself and has
become a different person.''
   ``This case was a tragedy when it first came before me years
ago, and it's a tragedy now. But unfortunately most cases I deal
with are tragedies,'' Eppes said before sentencing Ms. Smith, who
walked away from a work-release program in Columbia in 1978.
   Ms. Smith and Harpootlian said they were pleased with the
minimum sentence. He said they are working toward getting Ms. Smith
back to Maryland.
   She and Harpootlian had hoped that she would receive a minimum
sentence to be served near the Maryland home she shares with her
husband, Ray Smith, and two teen-age sons from her previous
marriage.
   ``It's not going to be easy at all. But I love my family very
much, we're very close and we'll get through it,'' Ms. Smith said.

   An Olympic diver pleaded innocent Monday to
charges that he drove a car into a group of teen-agers and killed
two of them, and a judge ordered him not to drive a car while he
awaits trial.
   Bruce Kimball faces two counts of drunken-driving manslaughter
and three counts of drunken-driving in an accident with serious
injury.
   Judge Harry Coe allowed the 1984 Olympic silver medalist to
remain free on $10,000 bond and said he would not restrict
Kimball's travel before his tentative trial date of Nov. 14 because
he was satisified the diver posed no risk of flight.
   The judge also said the high-profile case had drawn so much
publicity that ``the whole country in a sense is watching him.''
   Kimball, who finished second in the Olympic platform diving
competition four years ago, was a favorite to make the 1988 U.S.
team before the Aug. 1 accident. However, he did not qualify for
this year's squad during Olympic trials in Indianapolis earlier
this month.
   Kimball, 24, said nothing when attorney Frank Quesada entered
the plea before Coe. If convicted, Kimball faces up to 45 years in
prison.
   Co-defense counsel Lee Fugate did not object to the driving
restriction as a condition of bond, saying Kimball would be
attending the University of Michigan this fall and working
part-time at his father's diving school and could walk.
   Prosecutors have refused to release the results of Kimball's
blood-alcohol tests from the accident, but the Tampa Tribune has
reported it was 0.20 percent. Under Florida law, a driver with a
level of 0.10 of higher is presumed intoxicated.
   Police estimate Kimball was traveling between 70 and 90 mph when
his car struck several other vehicles and plowed through a group of
teen-agers gathered at a popular roadside hangout in suburban
Brandon.
   Coe instructed attorneys to notify witnesses that they would not
be allowed to publicly discuss the case. The judge cited concerns
for prospective jurors.
   He also set a meeting for Sept. 8 to discuss with media
representatives any restrictions he might impose on the press at
trial.

<HEAD>Editor Says US Attorneys Barred From Answering Meese Queries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newsletter editor said Monday the Justice
Department told him that U.S. attorneys are prohibited from
answering his written questions relating to the investigation of
former Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Russell Mokhiber, editor of Corporate Crime Reporter, released a
letter in which Manuel A. Rodriguez, legal counsel for the
executive office for U.S. attorneys, said Mokhiber needed to get
permission to obtain answers to his survey.
   ``Department of Justice policy prohibits U.S. attorneys from
responding to surveys unless they are endorsed by the executive
office for U.S. attorneys,'' Rodriguez wrote on Aug. 10, two days
before Meese left office. Mokhiber said he received the letter last
week.
   Rodriquez said that under a 1980 order signed by former Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti, all surveys of U.S. attorneys must be
coordinated by the executive office.
   Surveys include questionnaires from other Justice Department
offices as well as those from ``other organizations such as
research groups, government research contractors and grantees,
congressional committees and Congress members,'' the order says.
   Rodriguez told Mokhiber, ``The executive office has determined
that it would not be in the best interests of the Department of
Justice to permit the U.S. attorneys to participate in your
survey.''
   A department official, who spoke only on condition that he not
be identified, said the 1980 order was intended to keep U.S.
attorneys from being deluged by information-seekers.
   Any U.S. attorney can answer either a telephone or written
survey if he or she wants, the official said, but as a matter of
policy the prosecutor probably would not respond to a written
questionnaire unless it had been approved by the executive office.
   Mokhiber, who sent his one-page survey to most of the 93 U.S.
attorneys on July 29, said he never received any replies.
   In the survey, Mokhiber posed several hypothetical questions
requiring a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer.
   The questions did not mention Meese by name, but they referred
to an independent counsel's investigation of the attorney general.
Mokhiber said his questions were prompted by Independent Counsel
James McKay's investigation of Meese's personal and financial
dealings.
   McKay found that criminal prosecution of Meese was not
warranted, although he said the former attorney general probably
violated tax and conflict-of-interest laws. Meese said the report
vindicated him.
   Mokhiber asked the U.S. attorneys to pretend they were an
independent counsel. He then spelled out in broad terms allegations
similiar to those made against Meese.
   Mokhiber then asked if the U.S. attorneys would have prosecuted
the attorney general, given a statement that the attorney general
probably violated the law, and written a report detailing their
findings.
   In the letter, Mokhiber said he had planned to tabulate the
results in Corporate Crime Reporter, a two-year-old weekly
newsletter with about 100 subscribers.

<TEXT>
   The role of Vice President George Bush in the
Iran-Contra affair remains an important unanswered question in the
presidential campaign, according to a new book by two senators _ a
Democrat and a Republican _ who investigated the scandal.
   The two authors, Maine senators William Cohen and George
Mitchell, conclude that the Republican nominee should have been
aware that an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran was being arranged
and that he endorsed it. Cohen, a Republican, and Mitchell, a
Democrat, were members of the congressional Iran-Contra
investigating panel and the first insiders to write their own book
about the probe.
   ``The vice president endorsed the sale of weapons to Iran either
out of loyalty to the president or because he, too, was consumed by
the passion to obtain the freedom of the hostages,'' the two
senators wrote in the book, ``Men of Zeal: A Candid Inside Story of
the Iran-Contra Hearings.''
   Questioned Monday during the vice president's campaign stop in
Tennessee, Chief of Staff Craig Fuller said the book provided
nothing new on Bush's role in the affair.
   ``I don't believe there are any new insights contained in the
book ... it's more a readable version of information that was
gleaned from thousands of hours of hearings that were conducted,''
Fuller said. ``We've seen nothing new on the vice president.''
   Bush has sought to put the affair behind him, saying repeatedly
that while he nominally was President Reagan's anti-terrorism
chief, he was ``out of the loop'' on the Iran matter and didn't
understand a briefing on the arrangements he received in August
1986, more than three months before the affair became public.
   But he also has refused to talk about any discussions with
Reagan about the matter. Cohen and Mitchell write that while it is
possible Bush cautioned against the deal, evidence shows others in
the administration were convinced that the vice president supported
it.
   And they voice the opinion that even if Bush was not brought
into the decision-making on this major foreign policy initiative,
``his position (of support) would have remained the same.''
   The book breaks little new ground about the hearings, but adds
the perspective of two seasoned politicians on issues such as
Bush's awkward political position as Reagan's No. 2, the mistakes
made by the investigating panels in rushing the probe to beat
deadlines and negotiating with cagey defense lawyers, and the
panels' naive underestimation of how the hearings would play on
television.
   The senators note that no sitting vice president since Martin
Van Buren in 1836 has been elected president, in part because of
the conflict between the vice president's perceived role as second
in command and the reality that he usually is relegated to the
sidelines.
   ``Whatever his personal views, the vice president cannot
publicly disagree with the president's policies or action without
fracturing the bond of unity they must maintain,'' they wrote.
``The vice president lacks flexibility to express his views even in
private Cabinet-level sessions ...''
   In recounting the highlights of last summer's hearings and the
jockeying that went on behind the scenes, the authors note the
frustration of being interrupted constantly by House and Senate
floor votes and the lack of time to prepare for each new witness.
   The initial blunder, they contend, was allowing retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to become the leadoff witness for
the televised hearings, abandoning plans for a panel of ``wise
men'' to first lay out for viewers the way in which covert
intelligence operations are normally _ and legally _ conducted and
overseen.
   Public reaction soon showed that Secord, the operative who ran
much of the Iran arms deal and the diversion of profits to
Nicaragua's Contra rebels, came off looking patriotic while the
investigators ``had been perceived as hostile, belligerent,
pompous, patronizing or unpatriotic,'' they said.
   Later, using the panels' own deadlines against them, lawyers for
Lt. Col. Oliver North put their client before the television
cameras largely on his own terms. ``The committee had caved in,''
the senators concluded. When North testified, he ``held a Gatling
gun while we sat like ducks in a shooting gallery. The American
people loved it. A real Rambo had come to Washington.''
   The authors also point out several issues that investigators
were unable to fully pursue, including Israel's role in the initial
opening to Iranians that paved the way for the arms deals, detailed
accounting of the finances of Secord's ``Enterprise'' and the
activities of former CIA Director William Casey, who died on the
second day of hearings and was never interviewed.
   The book, published by Viking, will be available in bookstores
this week.

   The real costuming competition at the
Emmy Awards happened outside the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. And the
only disappointment was that there was no trophy for the winner.
   Despite oppressive heat, Hollywood's leading ladies feverishly
assembled some of the most overwhelming _ and outrageous _ Emmy
outfits on Sunday.
   Mary Tyler Moore, nominated for ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln,'' turned
heads with a pink and green Arnold Scaasi strapless gown. Jackee,
the star of ``227'' who doesn't use a last name, arrived at the
awards ceremony in a tight-fitting purple leopard-print creation.
   Jean Kasem, who's made something of a career with her outlandish
wardrobe, wore a purple harem ensemble, finished with a tiara and
beaded fringe. Her husband, radio announcer Casey Kasem, chose a
simple black tuxedo.
   Others, perhaps trying to keep cool, went for outfits that
showed more skin. Robin Givens, star of ``Head of the Class'' and
wife of boxer Mike Tyson, arrived in a see-through purple chiffon
top and a tiered skirt, designed by Gianni Versace. But nobody
stared too closely: Tyson was right there.
   Susan Dey, one of the attorneys in ``L.A. Law,'' strolled in
with a transparent black lace jacket, and nothing underneath. Linda
Hamilton, co-star of ``Beauty and the Beast,'' wore a low-cut
silver-embroidered black jacket she said she snagged in Rome.
   Ann Jillian, who starred as herself in ``The Ann Jillian
Story,'' was one of the evening's most elegant participants,
wearing a black velvet and tafetta Scaasi gown, with a silk rose in
the decolletage.
   Among the men, the odder fashion statements were made by ``21
Jump Street's'' Peter De Luise, who wore a sharkskin suit tux, and
Tommy Smothers, who completed his traditional tux outfit with a red
yo-yo.

   The veteran pilots had planned to
thrill their air show audience with a perfectly timed stunt, to
slickly manuever their 10 sleek jets into the shape of a huge,
high-flying heart.
   Instead, the aerial valentine turned into a fiery killer. One
jet collided with two others at the U.S. air base at Ramstein
Sunday, then crashed into the crowd.
   The disaster killed 46 people, including the three Italian air
force pilots.
   ``We have absolutely no idea what went wrong,'' Gen. John
Galvin, commanding officer of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, told reporters Monday at the air base.
   He said Italian authorities would lead the investigation into
the tragedy.
   A crowd of about 300,000 people were watching as the Italian
pilots, flying at nearly 450 mph, began performing the maneuver in
which the jets create a silhouette of a giant heart.
   ``Five of the planes came from one direction, and four came from
another. A single plane came from yet another direction, and there
was a huge crash,'' said a West German witness.
   Italian officials said that in the maneuver, nine aircraft fly
perpendicular to the runway and then begin to climb in front of the
spectators. At a certain point in the ascent the formation divides
into two groups of four and five planes that turn away in opposite
directions while descending in curves.
   The two groups then fly past each other while traveling in
opposite directions and parallel to the ground.
   As a spectacular finish the 10th jet flies through the formation
as the paths of the two groups of planes appear to intersect.
   That was when the stunt turned into a disaster.
   Rainer Bogensberger, an amateur pilot who witnessed the tragedy,
said the solo airplane collided with two of the other jets and it
``then plowed into the audience in a huge fireball.'' One of the
other planes crashed onto a runway and the third plunged into a
forest.
   The remaining jets circled the airfield for a few minutes before
landing.
   Witnesses said the jets were flying at an altitude of about 100
feet when the accident occurred.
   Klaus Koplin, head of the Federal Aeronautics Office in
Braunschweig, said regulations require that aircraft other than
helicopters stay above 500 feet.
   ``The pilot may go below this minimum altitude only for the
purpose of landing or taking off,'' he said.
   Other West German officials noted that the rules for air shows
at NATO bases are set by the military commands involved and not
civilian authorities.
   Galvin defended the competence of the Italian air demonstration
team.
   ``This team has been doing that maneuver since 1961. There has
never been an incident with that maneuver since then,'' he said.
   Bogensberger said the tragedy could have been worse.
   He said there were several military transport planes parked
about 600 feet from where the jet crashed into the crowd and
thousands of people were in that area.
   ``If this machine flew on for just another 200 meters (about 600
feet), it would have rammed right into these transport planes and
would likely have set off huge explosions,'' Bogensberger said.

<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Monday
criticized the Senate's judicial confirmation process, saying that
lawmakers expected judgeship nominees to give instant answers to
complex constitutional questions.
   Speaking before the Bicentennial Australian Legal Convention in
Canberra, Australia, Rehnquist said nominees are not computers,
``all primed to spew out answers when the proper button was
pushed.''
   The text of the chief justice's address was released by the
Supreme Court.
   Rehnquist said a judge ``is not measured by his capacity to come
up with instant answers to impromptu questions,'' but by his
ability to make a decision based on ``real life facts'' and lengthy
study of the law.
   He said that process ``is something which cannot possibly be
duplicated in a committee hearing room, and since it cannot be
duplicated, no nominee who is both prudent and honest can give
categorical answers to detailed questions of constitutional law.''
   Rehnquest, who appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee as
a nominee for associate justice and chief justice, was especially
critical of the process used to interrogate defeated Supreme Court
nominee Robert H. Bork.
   ``I think I speak for a great number of my fellow citizens of
the United States when I say there is a general feeling of
dissatisfaction with the process attending Judge Bork's nomination
_ a feeling which is shared by many of those who were happy to see
him denied confirmation,'' Rehnquist said.
   He said the Bork hearings consisted of ``exhaustingly detailed
examination of the nominee on his views of constitutional law, and
in particular on his view of the extent to which our constitution
recognized a right of privacy.
   ``The nadir of the public debate was reached when newspapers
publicized a list of home movies which the judge had checked out in
the months preceeding his confirmation hearing to look at on his
home movie viewer.''
   Rehnquist did not suggest how hearings should change, but
criticized the ``prolonged interrogation involved in the Bork
hearings.''

   Michael Dukakis should refine his message,
which is that ``the American people want change,'' New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo said Monday.
   Cuomo, who said he talked to fellow Democrat Dukakis on Friday
and has been talking with Dukakis aides over the last few days
about the message, told a news conference: ``You take the message
and write it in 15 pages and then you have someone write it in 7{
pages. And then you take the 7{ and make it three and then make it
a sheet.''
   ``You can probably get it down to half a sheet. The message is a
good one. The message is the American people want change. ... It's
just a question of refining the message a little bit.''
   Cuomo said current concerns among Democrats about Dukakis losing
the spotlight to Republican rival George Bush should disappear as
the campaign continues.
   ``To me the problem is very simple ...,'' said Cuomo. ``You go
to the Republican convention. They get the focus. They look good
and it (public opinion) swings back.
   ``We're still in the Republican Convention ... because of this
ironic twist that (Bush running mate Dan) Quayle kept the
Republicans in the mainstream with the light on them'' over
questions about the Indiana senator's background.

   President Reagan used recess appointments
Monday to fill two vacancies on the National Labor Relations Board,
one with a veteran agency lawyer who was opposed by Sen. Jesse
Helms and right-to-work advocates.
   Reappointed by Reagan to a five-year term expiring in August
1993 was Wilford W. Johansen, a board member since 1985 and
formerly head of the NLRB's regional office in Los Angeles.
   Also getting a recess appointment was John E. Higgins Jr., 48,
who as deputy general counsel was the highest-ranking non-political
appointee in the agency. His term would expire in December 1992.
Both Johansen and Higgins are Republicans.
   With a recess appointment while Congress is not in session, no
Senate confirmation is required. However, the appointments are
effective only until the end of the next session of Congress,
ending in January 1990.
   Reagan had nominated Higgins last February to fill the seat left
by the departure of Donald Dotson as the NLRB's chairman. But the
nomination had languished in the Senate since then because of
opposition from Helms, R-N.C., and the National Right-to-Work

   Right-to-work leaders opposed Higgins because of his office's
approval in 1986 of a contract between General Motors and the
United Auto Workers to use UAW members as the chief source of
workers for GM's new Saturn auto plant in Tennessee.
   The appointments still leave the five-member board with one
vacancy after Democrat Marshall Babson's resignation earlier this
month to return to private law practice.
   NLRB officials said they doubt Babson's chair will be filled
before the expiration of President Reagan's term in office Jan. 20.

   Peace talks between Iraq and Iran faltered Monday
over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the
sea, with both nations' foreign ministers staying away from the
negotiations.
   ``We are still at square one,'' said Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz of the 4-day-old negotiations. ``We have not found any
measure of good faith from the other side.''
   Aziz charged Iran with blocking the talks by refusing to allow
the waterway to be cleared immediately. The Shatt-al-Arab has been
blocked by sunken ships since the Persian Gulf war broke out in
1980.
   In New York, meanwhile, documents released at U.N. headquarters
disclosed a claim by Iran that Iraqi forces violated the truce that
began Aug. 20 by killing an Iranian soldier near Abadan, which is
at the Shatt-al-Arab's outlet to the gulf.
   Iran also claimed Iraqi forces captured more than 650 other
Iranian troops on Aug. 23 in the presence of U.N. military
observers near the city of Shush, about 300 miles southwest of
Tehran.
   The allegations were in a letter to the Security Council from
Iran's charge d'affaires, Mahmoud Sadat Madarshahi. The Iraqi
commander denied capturing the men, the letter said.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes would not discuss the allegations
and said ``They are being resolved and defused on the ground by the
commander'' of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
   Aziz and his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, did not attend Monday's truce talks in Geneva, deciding
to let aides do the work after the stalemate developed late Sunday.
   Full ministerial talks, tentatively set for Monday night, were
postponed until Tuesday at the earliest, said Francois Giuliani,
spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, who
is mediating the talks.
   ``The negotiations are continuing, without underrating the
difficulties that we face at the moment,'' Giuliani told reporters.
   Aziz told a news conference he was prepared to stay in Geneva
``as long as the mission requires.''
   Perez de Cuellar said after six days of talks Sunday that he was
``constantly putting forward ideas'' and ``building bridges between
the two sides'' to keep talks going.
   The aim of the talks is to turn a cease-fire that began Aug. 20
into a lasting, comprehensive settlement of the eight-year war that
has claimed an estimated 1 million lives.
   Face-to-face negotiations, the first since war broke out, were
held Thursday and Friday. They were suspended Saturday for what
Perez de Cuellar called ``a day of reflection.''
   Aziz said the main sticking points in negotiations were Iran's
refusal to agree to immediate clearing of the Shatt-al-Arab under
U.N. supervision and its unwillingness to discuss details of
ensuring freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf.
   Velayati has dismissed Iraq's insistence on dealing swiftly with
the Shatt-al-Arab issue as ``new preconditions.''
   He has said Iran's priorities in the talks are withdrawal of
troops to international borders, the exchange of prisoners of war
and an inquiry to determine who started the fighting.
   Aziz told reporters that immediate clearing of the waterway
would provide ``an equitable balance'' to Iraq's accepting freedom
of navigation for Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf. Iraq has done
so under the terms of the cease-fire.
   ``Iran already started using its ports along its long seashore
for trade'' and it would be ``legitimate and logical'' for Iraq
also to benefit from the cease-fire, Aziz said.
   He said Perez de Cuellar ``sympathizes'' with the Iraqi position.
   Another key dispute is over a 1975 Iran-Iraq treaty which sets
the border down the middle of the 120-mile Shatt-al-Arab, formed by
the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
   Iraq, which claims sovereignty over the waterway, says the
treaty has lapsed because of alleged Iranian violations.
   Iran has said a treaty cannot be renounced by one side only, and
has charged Iraq by undermining the talks with its stance.
   Resolution of the issue seems key to agreement on a troop
withdrawal to international borders, one of the points listed in a
July 20, 1987 U.N. cease-fire resolution that forms the basis of
the current peace talks.
   Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Saadoun Hamadi on Sunday
reaffirmed his country's claim in a toughly worded statement that
cast doubt on progress at the talks.
   Aziz was also asked to respond to accusations Monday by Massoud
Barzani, a leader of Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas, that Iraqi forces
have injured and killed Kurdish refugees in daily chemical bomb
attacks this month.
   ``I prefer not to comment on that,'' he said. ``That is a matter
of the past, and I like to concentrate on the future.''

<HEAD>Animal Rights Activists Condemn Surveillance By Furriers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists are angry at a furriers'
group that has collected information about them and turned it over
to the U.S. Justice Department.
   But a lawyer for a Denver furrier who is being sued by the Rocky
Mountain Humane Society says the group should have realized the
repercussions when it erected billboards opposing the wearing of
fur coats.
   ``They initiated the controversy with their billboards,''
attorney Neil Silver said Monday. ``They started it. I'm not saying
I agree with four-letter words being used over the telephone, but
they had to figure they were going to get some heat.''
   Silver represents furrier Dennis ``Gene'' Daily, who is being
sued by the Humane Society for allegedly harassing the organization
by telephone. Silver said his client is innocent and only
telephoned the Humane Society to ask for its address.
   ``He even gave them his name,'' Silver said.
   The society, which says it is opposed ``to the use of animals
for any purpose not truly in the animal's interest,'' has sponsored
billboards and newspaper ads against fur coats.
   Silver noted one such billboard, which shows a woman dragging a
bloody fur coat behind her. The billboard reads: ``It takes up to
40 dumb animals to make a fur coat. But only one to wear it.''
   The link between the New York-based Fur Retailers Information
Council and the Justice Department was revealed last week when the
Rocky Mountain Humane Society asked Daily in legal papers why he
was seeking its address.
   In court documents, Daily said the fur council had been asked by
the federal government to ``divulge all information'' it receives
from ``radical splinter groups who have passed themselves off as
concerned individuals for animal rights.''
   In the documents, Daily said he wanted the information to ``aid
in the prosecution of animal rights activists who have done damage
to numerous businesses ... and incite public violence over truly
non-existent issues.''
   Daily declined comment on the matter Monday, referring questions
to his attorney.
   Silver said Daily has filed a counterclaim against the Humane
Society, alleging libel and slander. The lawsuit against Daily is
set for trial in District Court in May.
   Tom Rilney of the Fur Retailers Information Council said, ``The
Justice Department has asked us for any information that we have on
the extremist groups and has encouraged us to have photographs
taken of demonstrators in front of fur stores.''
   But Jim Carvino of the Justice Department said the furriers
approached the Justice Department about two years ago about their
concerns. He said the government gave them general guidelines on
how to collect information, as it would any citizen seeking crime
prevention tips.
   Carvino said he turns over information provided by furriers to
the FBI. The bureau would neither confirm nor deny whether animal
rights groups are under investigation.
   Animal rights activists deny fur retailers' accusations that
they increasingly are using violence in their crusades.
   Denver lawyer Rowe Stanton, who represents the Rocky Mountain
Humane Society, called the reports of information being sent to the
FBI ``scary'' and ``outrageous.''
   He said the fur council ``has the impression that they have the
implied consent of the United States government to gather
information. And that does bother me, because they don't have to go
by constitutional safeguards.''

   An engineer who develops aerospace robotics is
leading an effort to retrieve pioneer astronaut Virgil ``Gus''
Grissom's Mercury space capsule, which sank at sea after splashdown
more than 27 years ago.
   ``I remember listening to those flights on the radio,'' said
Curt Newport of the early Mercury Project. ``It would be something
to finally come face to face with a piece of history.''
   Newport, 37, is seeking funding for the estimated $1.4 million
salvage of the Liberty Bell 7 capsule off Grand Bahamas Island,
about 300 miles southeast of Cape Canaveral.
   ``When I started looking into this back in late 1984, I always
thought that the most difficult part would be to convince people
that it could be recovered,'' said Newport. ``Now I'm finding that
the most difficult part is to locate someone willing to pay for
it.''
   Newport said side-scan sonar, similar to those employed in 1985
to locate the luxury liner Titanic at a depth of 2{ miles, would be
used to hunt for Liberty Bell 7 at a depth of about 1,600 feet of
water.
   Once the one-ton capsule is found, a manned submersible could
attach a cable so it could be reeled to the surface, he said.
   Newport has helped develop and operate underwater vehicles in
salvage work such as the recovery of pieces of an Air India jet
that went down off Ireland in 1985 and of the space shuttle
Challenger, which exploded just after launch in January 1986.
   Grissom's craft splashed down July 21, 1961, after about a
15-minute suborbital flight. But when a Navy helicopter hovered
overhead, explosive charges intended to open the hatch detonated
prematurely and the capsule began to fill with water before divers
could fit a flotation collar.
   Grissom swam to safety before the capsule sank.
   Some accounts, including one in the novel and movie ``The Right
Stuff,'' suggest Grissom panicked and blew the hatch himself. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, however, absolved
Grissom of blame.
   Grissom and two other astronauts were killed when their Apollo I
capsule caught fire on the launch pad in 1967.
   Newport said even if the hatch is recovered, it is unlikley it
could provide clues to what happened before the capsule's sinking.
   ``It's really an academic question,'' he said. ``Our purpose is
to recover a piece of space history. We certainly are not out to
make Gus Grissom look bad.''
   Newport, who lives in Annapolis, Md. and works for a NASA
subcontractor helping design robotics for the planned U.S. space
station, said NASA officials do not seem to have a great interest
in studying the capsule.
   ``They haven't said `Don't look for it,' but it's of very
limited value to them,'' said Newport. ``It seems more appropriate
in a museum or someplace where people can come look at it.''
   NASA officials in Washington, D.C., and at the Kennedy Space
Center did not respond to telephone messages seeking reaction to
Newport's plans.

   Heavy rain and four days of
floods have killed at least 31 people and left 15,000 homeless in
El Salvador, government and relief agency sources reported Monday.
   Overflows of the Lempa and Rio Grande de San Miguel, the
nation's largest rivers, swept away homes and damaged bridges and
roads, government reports said.
   Information Minister Roberto Viera said the worst damage, except
for areas along the rivers, was in the coastal regions of Usulutan,
San Miguel and La Union provinces and in the La Paz region of
central El Salvador.
   He said at least 26 people have died, six are missing and 15,000
homeless.
   Red Cross sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, gave a
higher death toll. They said 26 people were killed in Chilanguera
and La Cantora, two San Miguel hamlets 95 miles southeast of the
capital; two died in a coastal area of La Paz, and three people
died in Santa Tecla, seven miles from San Salvador.
   Relief organizations and civilian authorities said at least
10,000 peasants were evacuated in areas considered dangerous and
the coastal highway from the capital east was closed by flood
damage to roads and bridges.
   The National Weather Service predicted air masses converging
close to the coast and a tropical depression would continue to
bring rain.
   Last week, heavy rains fell on Nicaragua and Mexico.
   Nicaragua said crops were destroyed and 25,000 people made
homeless on the remote Caribbean coast. Mexico reported four people
killed and 112,000 temporarily evacuated.
   A mudslide caused by torrential rains In June killed 22 people
in El Salvador's La Union province. Five died in early August when
a river flooded in a northern suburb of the capital.

   President Daniel Ortega on Monday
extended a five-month cease-fire with Nicaraguan rebels until the
end of September.
   He also called on the presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica,
Guatemala and Honduras to resume talks on a Central American peace
plan. Ortega and the four other presidents last met in January.
   ``The Nicaraguan government extends until Sept. 30 the halt to
offensive military operations ... so the rebels can put down their
arms and accept amnesty,'' Ortega said in a speech to a group of
Indian leaders in Managua.
   The rebels, known as Contras, and the Sandinista government
first agreed to a cease-fire on March 21. Two days later they
signed a pact agreeing to negotiate an end to the the 7-year-old
war.
   Ortega's extension was the fourth of a formal 60-day truce that
took effect April 1. The U.S.-backed Contras said in June they
would observe the cease-fire indefinitely.
   Both sides have accused the other of violating the truce.
   A series of political talks to negotiate a permanent cease-fire
and pave the way for a peace settlement broke off June 9.
   Under the regional peace plan signed by the five Central
American presidents in August 1987, the Contras would lay down
their arms in exchange for concrete democratic measures by the
Sandinistas.
   There were these other developments:
   _Two Nicaraguan politicians left Managua Monday and went to
Miami to discuss with Contra leaders the release of political
prisoners.
   Erick Ramirez and Mauricio Diaz are members of the National
Reconciliation Commission set up under last year's peace plan.
   Ramirez said one issue is the fate of 75 Sandinista soldiers
held by the Contras as prisoners of war. He said the rebels
acknowledge holding the soldiers and have agreed to free them but
details must be worked out.
   Ramirez also said he had a list of names of more than 600
Nicaraguans whose whereabouts are unknown.
   _The archbishop of Managua, in an interview broadcast on the
Vatican City's radio station, said human rights violations are
continuing in Nicaragua despite the cease-fire.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo said, ``As for the war, the
fighting has diminished, but there are still, unfortunately, deaths
on both sides. Human rights violations continue and we are working
as men, Christians and pastors so that life is protected.''
   ``The truce has saved lives,'' he added, ``but many things have
not been realized. In my opinion, what is lacking is the
fundamental thing: Full democracy.''

<HEAD>Talks On Nuclear Tests Begin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators held preliminary
meetings Monday for a third round of talks they say could lead to
ratification of two treaties worked out in the 1970s to limit
nuclear tests.
   C. Paul Robinson, the U.S. delegation chief, and his Soviet
counterpart Igor Palenykh met at the U.S. mission Monday to discuss
administrative details, U.S. spokesman Art Skop said. The first
plenary session was expected to be held later this week.
   Both chief negotiators arrived Saturday. In separate airport
news conferences they expressed optimism that this round will
produce verification protocols for the 1970 treaties that have been
signed but not ratified.
   In Santa Barbara, Calif., White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Monday: ``We are making good progress toward our goal.''
   Palenykh said Saturday that this round ``should become a
milestone event in the dialogue between the U.S.S.R. and the United
States on this important problem of nuclear disarmament.''
   Verification, or anti-cheating, protocols being considered in
the negotiation are for the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the
1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. Both limit underground
nuclear test explosions to a strength of 150 kilotons of TNT.
   The two superpowers say they abide by the unratified agreements,
but the United States has said it will not ratify the documents
until they contain adequate provisions against cheating.
   Robinson told reporters Saturday that President Reagan had said
he would like the treaties ratified before he leaves office next
January.
   The protocols would be attached to the treaties, not changing
the language, and would include a ``menu'' of accepted monitoring
techniques either side could use to measure nuclear tests and
verify compliance, Robinson said.
   U.S. and Soviet specialists held a joint experiment Aug. 17 in
Nevada, where Soviet officials watched a U.S. nuclear test for the
first time and monitored it with their own equipment.
   A similar test is scheduled for Sept. 14 at the Soviet Union's
Semipalatinsk testing range.
   ``Expert level discussions'' on nuclear testing began in July
1986 and formal negotiations started last November.
   While both sides agree the first priority is the verification
protocols, they still apparently disagree about the step after that.
   The Soviets want immediate negotiations on a complete nuclear
test ban. Washington says nuclear tests are necessary while nuclear
weapons exist, in order to ensure their quality, and wants tests
reduced in tandem with arms stockpiles.

   An injured sailor pulled from a sunken
Peruvian submarine died Monday in a navy hospital, bringing to at
least five the number of seamen killed in the collision, navy
spokesman Capt. Oscar Ramos said.
   Navy divers searched Monday for three other seamen still missing
after the navy vessel plunged 110 feet to the bottom of the Pacific
Ocean after a collision Friday with the 412-ton Japanese fishing
boat No. 8 Kyowa Maru.
   The navy holds out no hope for the survival of the missing men.
Four others died on Friday.
   The seaman who died Monday was the submarine's radio operator,
Ramos said, and was among 45 sailors who were rescued Friday and
Saturday.
   About 21 sailors were saved Friday when they jumped from the
sub, the Pacocha, as it sank on Friday. Another 24 were pulled from
crippled submarine during day-long rescue operations on Saturday.
   Ramos said the operator was the last sailor rescued because he
stayed behind to maintain communications with the rescue team.
   The submarine went down three miles off Callao, Peru's largest
port, which lies eight miles west of Lima.
   Defense Minister Enrique Lopez said the fishing boat owners
could be fined. He said the boat accidentally rammed the submarine
in the stern shortly after dark Friday.
   President Alan Garcia said a ``bad maneuver'' by the boat caused
the collision. No one among the 21-member fishing boat crew was
hurt, but the vessel suffered cracks in its steel hull, the
Japanese Embassy said.

<TEXT>
   A leader of rebel Kurds in Iraq accused
Turkey on Monday of closing its border to thousands of Kurdish
refugees fleeing chemical bomb attacks by Iraq's military.
   Massoud Barzani, chairman of the Kurdish Democratic Party, one
of the main groups fighting for ethnic autonomy, said in a
statement that 500 Kurds were killed and 3,000 wounded in Iraqi
attacks this month.
   A Foreign Ministry official in Turkey said the border was not
closed but his government had taken security measures. He did
elaborate, but observers assumed that meant keeping Kurds from
slipping across the frontier.
   Barzani's statement, in English, was dictated to The Associated
Press in Nicosia by a spokesman for his group. The spokesman would
not give his name, citing security reasons.
   ``Turkey has closed its borders with Iraq and denied refuge to
tens of thousands of Kurdish refugees,'' the statement said, adding
that the Kurds were fleeing ``as a result of daily chemical attacks
(and) are assembling at the border opposite the town of Cucurca in
the Hakari province. They include several hundred people injured by
poison gas.''
   ``Many, especially children, are dying daily of chemical burns,
hunger and cold weather as they wait,'' Barzani said. ``The
environment and food stuffs have been contaminated by poison gas.
There are fears of epidemic and starvation. We appeal to the
Turkish government to allow in at least the chemically injured,
children and women on humanitarian grounds.''
   About 10 million of Turkey's 55 million people are Kurds and 3.5
million Kurds live in northern Iraq. A total of 20 million inhabit
the mountainous area where the borders of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Syria
and the Soviet Union converge, and their fight for autonomy has
spanned generations.
   A Kurdish Marxist group known as the Kurdish Labor Party has
fought the army in southeast Turkey since 1984. About 700 people
have died on each side.
   Turkey and Iraq have an agreement under which their forces may
penetrate 6 miles into each other's territory in pursuit of Kurdish
rebels. Iraq has not used the option but Turkey has done so three
times in recent years, twice to bomb guerrilla camps.
   The Barzani statement accused Iraq of a ``full-scale chemical
and physical slaughter'' of the Kurds. He asked U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, the International
Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees to ``urge the government of Turkey to offer refuge to our
people.''
   Iraqi chemical attacks ``continued and intensified'' Friday and
Saturday in the Zakho, Amadiyah and Sheikhan districts, the
statement said, with warplanes dropping chemical bombs while
artillery and tank cannon shelled villages.
   Barzani claimed a ``fierce'' battle was under way in the Dahok,
Mosul and Irbil districts between Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish
guerrillas known as Peshmergas, or ``those who face death.''
   Western diplomats in Baghdad say privately the scale of Iraq's
crackdown on its Kurds, many of whom were allied with Iran, grew
when a truce began Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   In Ankara, the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``It is
natural for Turkey to take measures considered necessary for its
security. Turkey is behaving now, as in the past, in complete
awareness of its international obligations.''
   Diplomats said that was a reference to the 1951 Geneva
Convention on Refugees. They said Turkey, in signing the
convention, stipulated that it would use its own discretion in
admitting refugees from countries outside Europe.
   Turkey has allowed hundreds of thousands of people fleeing
Iran's fundamentalist Islamic Republic to travel west through its
territory and about 600,000 Iranian refugees remain in Turkey.

<HEAD>Kidnap Victim Says She Doubts Hidden Cache Exists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who was nearly killed over the
weekend worries that she's still in danger because of rumors of a
$3.5 million cache supposely hidden by her drug dealer husband,
money she doesn't believe exists.
   Gail Fleming, whose husband is a convicted cocaine kingpin, was
kidnapped from her auto dealership Saturday and could have been
killed if police had not rescued her and arrested two men,
according to officers in Chatham County.
   ``The $3.5 million is a jailhouse rumor,'' Mrs. Fleming said
Sunday. ``I'm scared somebody out there thinks I know something I
don't know. There is no $3.5 million. If there is, I don't know a
dog-gone thing about it!''
   After her husband Charles' conviction and imprisonment, rumors
began to spread that he had hidden away millions of dollars in the
Savannah area when he knew he was going to be convicted of drug
smuggling.
   Police would not comment Monday on the possibility of the money
existing or on how strongly some people believe in it.
   Mrs. Fleming said the persistent rumor about the hidden money is
not only troublesome but ironic. She said she spent time behind
bars herself on cocaine conspiracy charges related to her husband's
case, is now divorcing him, and is barely getting by financially.
   Chatham County Police Capt. H.J. Lowery said police have heard
some of the rumors that Fleming has millions stashed away, but they
attribute most of it to inmates telling tales.
   ``Most of this is just prison talk, coming from within the
prison,'' he said.
   Lowery said police have no reason to believe the stories. ``It's
possible, I guess, but there's nothing we can go on to substantiate
it,'' he said.
   Saturday morning, according to police, kidnappers abducted Mrs.
Fleming from her auto dealership, locked her in a cage in a van and
drove her around for three hours, taunting her with impending death
and asking for directions to the cash.
   When no site was revealed, duct tape was wrapped around her head
and she nearly suffocated at the brink of a hastily dug grave.
   She was rescued in the nick of time because two youngsters
witnessed part of the action and called police, officials said.
   County officer Joe Chalmers and off-duty U.S. Marshal Ray
Reycestro responded.
   Chalmers saw the van drive by, stopped it and arrested John
Bruce Vining, 57, a paroled federal prisoner. Reycestro ran into
the woods and rescued Mrs. Fleming. Also arrested was Larry Roger
Stewart, 47, an escaped federal prisoner from Maxwell Air Force
Base.
   Vining and Steward face charges of conspiracy to commit murder
and kidnapping, as well as federal charges of escape and possession
of weapons by felons, police said.
   Mrs. Fleming's husband was sentenced to 375 years in prison and
fined $730,000 after a lengthy 1984 trial. He suffered a heart
attack in 1984 in prison, and is serving a negotiated sentence of
12 years without parole. He is imprisoned in a federal penitentiary
at Tallahassee, Fla.
   Twenty-one other people pleaded guilty to charges connected with
the case, including Mrs. Fleming, Fleming's son, two daughters and
their husbands and one of Fleming's ex-wives.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with 90,000 British fans singing `Happy
Birthday.'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 90,000 British fans joined in a
30th birthday salute Monday to pop music star Michael Jackson, who
spurns such observances but graciously acknowledged the spontaneous
gesture.
   ``He doesn't celebrate birthdays, but more than 90,000 people
rose to the occasion tonight and sang `Happy Birthday' to him,''
tour spokesman Bob Jones said in a telephone interview from
backstage at Round Hay Park in Leeds, England.
   ``Of course, he was forced to acknowlege it. He simply said,
`Thank you,''' said Jones.
   A typical Jackson birthday was planned: No fanfare, no gifts and
no birthday cake, in keeping with remnants of his earlier Jehovah's
Witnesses religious beliefs, said his Los Angeles publicist Lee
Solters.
   Birthdays aren't celebrated by Jehovah's Witnesses followers.
   But the fans at Leeds, the latest stop on Jackson's 43-date
European concert tour, wouldn't let the opportunity pass them by.
   ``I've never seen anything like this,'' said Jones, who has
worked with Stevie Wonder, The Four Tops, Lionel Richie, the
Temptations and other performers. ``This gentleman is something
else.''
   Jackson may be moonwalking into his fourth decade, but he
doesn't look a day over 20, attributed in large part to a
vegetarian diet and cosmetic surgery.
   His most recent album, ``Bad,'' has sold more than 11 million
copies worldwide.

   Iran claims Iraqi forces violated the
Persian Gulf truce by capturing hundreds of Iranian soldiers as
U.N. military observers looked on, according to documents released
Monday.
   The Tehran government accused Iraq of numerous violations of the
cease-fire that began Aug. 20, according to a letter to the
Security Council from Iran's charge d'affaires, Mahmoud Sadat
Madarshahi.
   ``As we said very early on, we won't discuss the substance of
any violations,'' said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes. ``They are
being resolved and defused on the ground by the commander'' of the
U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
   Madarshahi's letter also said that on Thursday ``an Iranian
military personnel was hit by an Iraqi bullet and martyred'' near
Abadan, which is at the Shatt al-Arab waterway's outlet to the gulf.
   The letter said that on Aug. 23, U.N. military observers saw
Iraqi forces capture 69 officers and 597 soldiers in two incidents
about 300 miles southwest of Tehran near the city of Shush.
   The Iraqi commander denied capturing the men, the letter said.
   Iran's letter said Iraqi forces withdrew to their own lines from
the Sharhani-Chamsari area near Einkhosh and Dezful, about 290
miles south of Tehran, after consulting with U.N. observers Aug. 23.
   The Iranian letter contained numerous allegations of Iraqi
maneuvers on the 730-mile front line, which it said violated the
cease-fire.
   In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency on Monday leveled
countercharges, saying Iranian soldiers approached Iraqi positions,
raised Iranian flags on the front, launched boats on the Shatt
al-Arab and set up a machine gun.
   Also Monday, the United Nations announced that Peru and Uruguay
will send contingents of military observers to the U.N.
peacekeeping group, which already has 24 nations participating.
   The peacekeeping group had 350 unarmed military observers and
more than 1,000 military and civilian support staff. Ms. Younes
said the number of personnel to be added by Peru and Uruguay had
not yet been determined.

   Soldiers seriously wounded a West Bank man who
broke a curfew Monday to meet an ambulance called for his son,
hospital officials said, and Palestinians described alleged abuse
in an Israeli prison camp.
   In the Gaza Strip, Israeli authorities delayed the openings of
junior high and high schools for the new school year, affecting
about 100,000 Palestinian youngsters. School was supposed to begin
Thursday, but an army spokesman said junior highs would reopen two
weeks late and high schools Oct. 1.
   Earlier this month, the army delayed reopening West Bank schools
attended by about 300,000 students until at least Oct. 1.
   Israel says the schools are rallying points for student protest,
which is at the core of the rebellion among the 1.5 million
Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   At least 255 Palestinians have been killed since the uprising
began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 war. Four Israelis also have been slain.
   In Nablus, the largest city in the West Bank, soldiers shot
Bilal Shabi, 42, in the chest when he emerged from his house during
a curfew, according to Israel radio and officials at Mukassad
Hospital.
   A neighbor said Shabi came to his house early Monday to use the
phone to call an ambulance for his 10-year-old son, Kayed, who had
a lung infection.
   ``Then he went down to wait for the ambulance so the driver
wouldn't get lost,'' the neighbor told The Associated Press,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Shabi lives in the old section
of the city, a crowded quarter of narrow alleys that often are
unmarked.
   Officials at another hospital, Tulkarem, said a Palestinian from
nearby Bala village was wounded in the left arm and right leg when
Israeli soldiers opened fire on Arabs hurling rocks and bottles.
   The military command confirmed the Nablus shooting but gave no
details. A spokesman said he had no information about other
incidents involving firearms.
   In Ramallah, troops shot and wounded 17-year-old Hatham El
Dugri, the national news agency Itim said.
   In Hebron, a 44-year-old Israeli woman was injured by a stone,
Israel radio and Itim said. The radio also said police confiscated
a Jewish settler's pistol after he wounded two Arab stone-throwers
Sunday in the West bank town of Qalqiliya.
   Three Palestinians described alleged abuse at Ketziot, a tent
prison in the Negev Desert. They said detainees were beaten, given
insufficient water and food and exposed to the sun for long periods.
   At a news conference called by the Israeli League for Civil and
Human Rights, 16-year-old Walid Sayfi said he was forced to strip
naked, cover himself with paint and stand in the sun for hours,
then soldiers clubbed him to remove the dried paint flakes.
   The army denied the allegations. ``This never happened,'' an
army official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another prisoner, Khaled Youssef Moussa, 28, said troops tied
his hands and feet so he had to stand bent over backward in what
inmates call ``the banana position.''
   A parliamentary debate was held about Ketziot, where about 2,500
Palestinians are held, many for up to six months without trial.
   Legislators rejected a motion to close the prison and
investigate the deaths of two Palestinian detainees killed by
soldiers in a prison riot earlier in August.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would not close its
prisons and warned Palestinians: ``If you continue the violence,
the violence will be met by force.''
   A poll released Monday by the Jerusalem-based Institute for
Advanced Strategic and Political Studies indicated most Israelis
believe army policy is too weak and Jews are being victimized.
   Israeli legislators rejected a motion to debate statements by
PLO deputy Salah Khalaf saying the Palestine Liberation
Organization plans to form a government in exile and suggesting it
will recognize Israel.
   Mattiyahu Peled of the Jewish-Arab Progressive Movement for
Peace accused the government of neglecting ``an historic
opportunity for peace.''
   Roni Milo of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc said the
remarks by Khalaf were part of a PLO plan to destroy Israel.

   The mayor of the Siberian village of Dickson
said Monday that his stay in this sound-alike town that was
President Reagan's boyhood home has been an eye-opener and that he
no longer equates greed with the average American.
   Mayor Nikolai T. Kartamyshev and two other Soviet citizens bid
farewell after a busy week promoting goodwill, touring businesses
and establishing sister-city ties.
   ``If my impressions haven't changed 180 degrees to the other
side,'' Kartamyshev said through an intrepreter, ``then they have
changed to a very great extent.''
   The Siberian official told a news conference he was brought up
to believe a caricature of Americans.But now, he no longer thinks
of Americans as ``fat bureaucrats dressed in black suits with
dollar sign symbols on their stomachs,'' he said.
   Kartamyshev and officials of Dixon, about 100 miles west of
Chicago, signed a document at the news conference cementing their
sister-city status.
   This community of 15,700, well-known because of its ties to
Reagan, was chosen by Kartamyshev after he read about its economic
problems. He contacted officials in Dixon in early 1987 about
forming ties.
   In his first overtures, Kartamyshev expressed fear of world war
because of Reagan's ``evil empire'' rhetoric.
   But when he arrived in Dixon last Thursday, Kartamyshev praised
Reagan's efforts to ease world tensions.
   The idea of a small-town goodwill meeting came from Dixon Mayor
James E. Dixon, a descendant of the town's founder, who invited his
Soviet counterpart to the United States for a visit.
   He said he believed a cultural exchange between the nations is a
key to Reagan's efforts to bring the superpowers closer together.
   The highlight of the Dickson-to-Dixon summit was Thursday when
the three Soviets toured the modest two-story, white-frame house
where Reagan lived as a 9-year-old boy in 1920. Crowds gathered
wearing ``Peace on Earth'' buttons in English and Russian.
   ``I have written in the special (guest) book inside that a great
man deserved a great memory and I am happy to be at such a special
place,'' Kartamyshev said as the group left the three-bedroom house.
   ``There are a lot of great men who have come from small and
ordinary places,'' he said.
   Reagan was born in nearby Tampico in 1911 and lived in several
Dixon houses with his parents, Jack and Nelle, and older brother
Neil, from 1920 until he left for college in 1928.
   The remote frontier village of Dickson, population 5,000, is on
the Taimry Peninsula in extreme northern Siberia, above the Arctic
Circle.
   Kartamyshev wrote last spring that every letter from Dixon ``is
a remarkable event in our small town.''
   Dickson was named for Oskar Dickson, a 19th-century Swedish
merchant who provided supplies for early expeditions by Arctic
explorers. It generally is closed to foreign visitors because of
nearby military installations.
   Dixon was founded by the mayor's great-great-great-grandfather,
John Dixon, as a Rock River ferryboat crossing in 1830. Abraham
Lincoln was stationed at Fort Dixon at age 23, during the Black
Hawk War, and there met Jefferson Davis, his future Civil War
adversary.

<HEAD>Official Says EPA Ban On New Polluters Won't Reduce Southern
California Smog</HEAD>

   The smog-clogged Los Angeles Basin will fail
to meet federal clean air standards well into the 21st century,
despite a ban on major new pollution sources, the area's air
quality chief said Monday.
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans Monday to
block construction of facilities that would emit more than 100 tons
of carbon monoxide or ozone pollutants a year as a congressional
moratorium on such sanctions expires.
   The move came as no surprise to James M. Lents, executive
officer of the South Coast Air Quality Management District, who
said the ban would do nothing to reduce smog in the nation's most
populous urban area.
   ``We've known for some time that if Congress didn't act, the
construction ban would go into effect,''said Lents, who oversees
smog eradication efforts in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and
Riverside counties.
   But he said the EPA ban only affects those seeking to build
heavy duty sources of pollution on the magnitude of oil refineries,
power-generating plants or automotive factories, and that no such
facilities are planned for the region.
   ``Based on the permit applications we've received this year and
last, the ban will have absolutely no effect on smog abatement in
the short run,'' Lents said, adding that it will take at least 20
years to clear Southern California smog to acceptable levels.
   The EPA announcement followed a Saturday ``Air Pollution
Summit'' at City Hall organized by the Coalition for Clean Air,
Campaign California, a group brought together by state Assemblyman
Tom Hayden.
   Among other proposals, speakers called for tight controls on
urban growth to help clear smog-burdened skies.
   ``I don't think it goes after the problem,'' Hayden said in a
telephone interview from Sacramento. ``But certainly the pressure
of the federal government has to be welcome.
   ``Los Angeles has intolerable levels of air pollution. I'm told
current smog levels will expose everybody in the basin to toxic
pollution 200 to 300 percent above acceptable health standards,''
he said.
   The Los Angeles Basin comes under the EPA sanctions slated to
take effect at midnight Tuesday because the air pollution control
plan it submitted to the agency was rejected.
   A lawsuit brought by environmentalists resulted in a January
federal court order requiring the EPA to reject the Los Angeles
plan because it failed to bring regional air quality into
compliance with the 10-year deadline set by the 1977 Clean Air Act,
Lents said.
   The EPA maintains that the law permits penalties only for
failure to submit and follow plans. There is no penalty for failure
to meet the standards if an agency-approved control plan did not
work out.
   But since Los Angeles has no approved plan on file with the
agency it falls under the federal sanctions.
   Los Angeles was one of about 100 metropolitan areas that the EPA
said missed last December's deadline to contain smog at acceptable
levels.
   Lents said his agency will present a draft of a new 20-year smog
reduction plan at a Sept. 9 meeting, with approval by the Air
Quality Management District board expected in December. It would
then go to the EPA for final approval.
   The new plan features stricter measures to regulate and
prosecute polluters, and broadens existing operations like using
California Highway Patrol officers to get vehicles spewing illegal
exhaust off the road, he said.
   Special targets will be fuel refineries, furniture manufacturers
and auto painting shops. Within eight years, it is hoped those
emissions can be reduced 90 percent, he said.

<HEAD>Canine Virus Believed To Be Seal Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PIETERBUREN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disease that has killed more
than 11,000 seals in Western Europe's coastal waters is caused by a
virus common in domestic dogs, a Dutch biologist said Monday.
   But there is little man can do to stop the disease from
spreading and up to 80 percent of the seals in the North Sea and
Kattegat waters between Denmark and Sweden might eventually die,
according to Ab Osterhaus.
   ``Canine distemper virus, or a closely related virus, is the
primary cause of the seal deaths,'' Osterhaus told a news
conference in this northern Dutch village that has Western Europe's
largest seal nursery.
   The virus causes infections of the respiratory and central
nervous systems and the digestive tracts. Osterhaus said there is
no specific cure for seals that have the virus.
   There is a possibility the virus spread to seals when one was
bitten by a dog, said Osterhaus of the Dutch National Institute for
Popular Health and Environmental Protection.
   Specialists in Western Europe who have been investigating the
seal deaths have speculated pollution has played a role in the
killer epidemic.
   Osterhaus said antibodies to canine distemper virus were found
in all of the dead seals he examined.
   ``The development of these antibodies coincided clearly with the
surfacing of symptoms'' of the disease, he said.
   A similar report was made at a news conference Monday in
Stockholm, Sweden, by patholigist Anders Bergman of Stockholm
University's veterinary school. He said he began suspecting in June
that the canine distemper virus was linked to the seal deaths.
   Bengt Klingeborn, a virologist at the veterinary school, said he
believed the 25 percent of Western European seals that have
survived so far will live through the epidemic because they have
developed antibodies.
   Osterhaus noted there had been an outbreak of the canine
distemper virus among dogs in Greenland shortly before the epidemic
erupted among seals early this year. Each summer thousands of seals
migrate from Greenland to Western European waters.
   Osterhaus said his team had developed an experimental vaccine
against the canine distemper virus but added ``it will not be
possible to carry out preventive vaccinations in the wild.''
   He said research is still being conducted to determine if the
massive pollution of Western European waters could have accelerated
the epidemic by weakening the seals' immune systems.
   ``We know that certain substances we find in the seas today .. .
can affect the immune system,'' he said. ``Pollution may have
triggered the thing but it was not the cause as such.''
   Sweden has reported 3,400 dead seals, Denmark nearly 3,000, West
Germany 3,900, Norway 600 and the Netherlands 175.

   Iran has repaired its Salman oil platform
in the Persian Gulf after the rig was shelled by U.S. warships and
has boosted its overall oil production to 200,000 barrels a day, an
official said Monday.
   Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh on Tehran Radio, monitored in
Nicosia, that the platform ``is producing 50,000 barrels a day,
about 35 percent of its capacity'' and that Iran plans to boost its
production to 160,000 barrels a day.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, meanwhile, reported
Monday that a pipeline had been completed between Bandar Anzali on
the Caspian Sea and Rasht.
   The Iranian news agency said refined oil products from the
Soviet Union will be off-loaded at Bandar Anzali and piped to
Rasht, where they will be distributed to other parts of Iran.
   Iran, though a major oil producer, lost much of its refining
capacity to Iraqi air raids.
   U.S. warships pounded the Salman and Nasr platforms in the
southern gulf on April 18, in retaliation for the mining of the
U.S. frigate Samuel B. Roberts.
   U.S. Navy shellfire on Oct. 19 badly damaged two other Iranian
platforms in the gulf, Rakhsh and Rostam, in retaliation for an
Iranian missile attack on the U.S.-flagged, Kuwait-owned tanker Sea
Isle City near Kuwait's Al-Ahmadi loading terminal.
   At that time, Iran estimated damage to those two platforms at
$500 million.
   Aqazadeh made no mention Monday of the other damaged platforms.
   But Iran has said that following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the
8-year-old war with Iraq, it plans to repair the damaged oil
installations with ``maximum speed.''
   Iran's pre-war offshore production was an estimated 500,000
barrels a day. By 1986, damage from Iraqi attacks had halved that
level.

   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians clashed
with police during a protest against a new rule requiring bilingual
education, and nine officers were injured, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
   Tanjug said several arrests were made, but gave no figures.
   It said the predominately young demonstrators in Kumanovo, about
260 miles south of Belgrade, were demanding that local schools form
separate classes taught exclusively in the Albanian language.
   They asked Yugoslavia to void a decision that classes should be
taught both in Albanian and Macedonian, the language of the local
Slav majority, according to a report on Belgrade television's
nightly news program.
   The demonstrators chanted ``We want freedom!'' and ``Let's go to
Belgrade!'' as police cordoned off the building where local
educational authorities met to consider the issue, the television
report said.
   As the demonstrators dispersed, about 200 of them began pelting
police with stones and demanding they be allowed to march through
the town, said Tanjug.
   The police used ``forceful means to prevent a breakdown of law
and order,'' Tanjug said.
   The school board decided in June to discontinue
Albanian-language classes and allow only bilingual instruction.
   Out of 900 eligible ethnic Albanian students, only 140 have
enrolled so far in Kumanovo elementary and secondary schools for
the coming term to protest having to learn Macedonian, the
television report said.

   A prominent Shiite Moslem militia leader in
southern Lebanon said Monday his bodyguards thwarted an attempt to
assassinate him.
   Daoud Daoud, military commander of the Syrian-backed Amal
militia in southern Lebanon, told reporters his guards found a
100-pound explosive charge concealed in his garage and the bomb was
set to be detonated by remote control.
   Daoud lives in Bidyas, 11 miles east of the port city of Tyre.
   He declined to say who he thought might have planted the bomb.
   In April, Daoud led a four-day campaign against Amal's main
Shiite rival, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
southern Lebanon. More than 60 people were killed and 150 wounded
in the fighting.

<DATELINE>VENTURA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Charlie Daniels, whose new album
``Homesick Heroes'' includes the single ``Uneasy Rider '88,'' was
uninjured when his group's rented 40-foot motor home caught fire on
a highway.
   Six people, including Daniels and three members of his country
band, were in the motor home late Sunday night when the fire broke
out about 16 miles south of Ventura.
   The group, whose hits have included ``Long Haired Country Boy,''
``The South's Gonna Do It'' and ``The Devil Went Down To Georgia,''
had just finished a show at the Ventura County Fair, a spokesman
said Monday.
   Passing motorists spotted smoke coming from the front of the rig
and flagged the group down, said band agent Alan Hopper.
   ``It didn't really start blazing until we were all off,'' said
band road manager David Corlew, adding there's ``never a dull
moment'' in life on the road.
   ``Just tell everybody we set them on fire in Ventura,'' Tommy
Crain, the band's lead guitarist, told Hopper.
   Hopper and Steve Ball, news editor of the Daily Journal in San
Francisco, were not far behind the motor home. When they arrived,
flames were shooting 30 feet into the air, Hopper said.
   ``We stopped after we saw the thing on fire. It was really
incredible, this thing was a ball of flames,'' Ball said.
   Daniels and the band got on the crew bus, which carries the
group's instruments, and continued on, Hopper said.
   ``Charlie was very calm and happy that they were able to
escape,'' Hopper said. ``They headed right on down the road. ...
They've got more dates to play.
   ``Charlie just said, `thank God for the motorists''' who flagged
down the unmarked motor home, Hopper said. ``They had no idea they
were saving Charlie Daniels.''
   The cause of the fire was unknown, and damage to the vehicle was
estimated at $45,000, said Ventura County Fire Department
dispatcher Paula Aliano.

<HEAD>Ship Carrying Toxic Waste Anchored Off England, Under Surveillance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West German-owned ship believed to be carrying
2,100 tons of highly toxic chemical waste is anchored off south
England and is being closely monitored, a government minister said
Monday.
   The motor vessel Karin B was believed to be carrying poisonous
waste which came from Italy and had been dumped illegally in
Nigeria, according to the environmental group Friends of the Earth.
   Junior Environment Minister Virginia Bottomley said Britain
plans to contact Italian authorities ``to hear their proposals for
the waste.''
   She said it was in nobody's interest to have ``footloose cargoes
of dangerous wastes drifting the seas of the world searching for a
port of call. What matters most is that this cargo should be
disposed of safely in carefully supervised conditions.''
   Mrs. Bottomley said the ship was under close surveillance and
that she would hold an urgent meeting Tuesday to review the
situation.
   The Karin B was spotted Monday morning anchored eight miles off
Eddystone lighthouse, about 20 miles south of Plymouth, said a
spokesman for the Department of Environment, who by custom was not
identified.
   ``As yet, it hasn't made any approach to any of the
harbormasters of the local ports. So we're waiting to see what
their next move will be,'' the spokesman said.
   The ship was refused permission Friday to enter Neath, south
Wales.
   Friends of the Earth spokesman Andrew Lees said the cargo
includes highly inflammable solvents, corrosive liquids and
cancer-causing chemicals.
   Nigeria ordered Italy to remove the waste from an illegal dump
at Koko on the banks of the Niger River. The Italian government
chartered the Karin B, but claimed Italy lacked the facilities to
dispose of the toxic waste, Lees said.
   Spain and West Germany have refused to take the waste and the
ship was refused a berth at Neath because the port was too shallow,
Lees said.
   He said Britain has become an international destination for
toxic waste because of its ``lax environmental laws.''

   Church secretary-turned-topless-model
Jessica Hahn's debut as a radio personality Monday was praised by
her boss, but a newspaper's media critic called it a ``bust.''
   Jay Stevens, KOY-FM program director, said listener response to
Ms. Hahn was all positive.
   But Bud Wilkinson, radio-television critic for The Arizona
Republic, writing for Tuesday's editions, said that Ms. Hahn's
presence brought down the momentum and mirth of the entire ``Y-95
Morning Zoo,'' as the radio station's morning show is known.
   The station announced last week that Ms. Hahn, 29, had been
signed to a 30-day contract with options for renewal.
   Ms. Hahn became an overnight celebrity in 1987 when revelations
about her sexual liaison with evangelist Jim Bakker led to his
giving up his PTL religious television network.
   The former $80-dollar-a-week church secretary from West Babylon,
N.Y., sold her story to Playboy magazine, posed topless for the
publication's November 1987 issue and moved into the Playboy
Mansion in Los Angeles.
   She appeared in Playboy a second time in the magazine's
September issue in semi-nude photographs showing off her recent
cosmetic surgery.
   Although Stevens denied hiring Ms. Hahn as a publicity stunt and
said that both she and the station ``want to make this a long-term
agreement,'' Wilkinson advised her not to unpack her bags.
   ``What she needs are a few nips and tucks in the area of
spontaneity,'' Wilkinson said, adding that ``as an air talent, Hahn
isn't a sleeper, a wit awaiting harvest, but rather a bust.''
   Stevens, however, said listeners reacted positively to the Ms.
Hahn.
   ``Believe it or not we didn't get any negative calls at all,''
he said. ``The people in Phoenix were happy to have her here. Some
(of the callers) welcomed her to Phoenix, and some offered dates.''

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's Ulemas Council of
Moslem theologians ruled Monday that saboteurs and terrorists can
be punished by execution. The death sentence in the Saudi kingdom
is carried out by beheading by sword.
   The council is the supreme authority on the interpretation of
Islamic judicial matters.
   After a four-day meeting in Taif, the council issued its
decisions that were distributed by the official Saudi press agency.
   The lengthy statement referred to ``saboteurs and those who
spread corruption on earth.'' It specifically mentioned hijacking
and acts of sabotage against oil installations, both recurrent acts
of terrorism against countries in the region.
   The council statement said its decision was based ``on a number
of acts of sabotage which have cost the lives of many innocent
people, caused damage to much properties and finances and public
institutions in many Islamic and other countries, carried out by
the poor of faith or those who lack it altogether, sick and envious
elements.
   ``It has been noted that several such crimes have been committed
in near and distant countries and since Saudi Arabia like others is
subject to such acts of sabotage, the council of top Ulemas saw it
was necessary to endorse a deterrent punishment for those who
commit such acts ... with the aim of spreading corruption and
instability.''

<TEXT>
   The Home Affairs Ministry said Monday Singapore
has barred the entry of journalists representing the Far Eastern
Economic Review and the Asian Wall Street Journal because of
foreign reporters posing as tourists.
   It said in a statement that correspondents of the Far Eastern
Economic Review, a weekly magazine published in Hong Kong,
repeatedly entered Singapore as tourists but for the purpose of
reporting in violation of immigration law.
   ``Because of this flagrant abuse, the government has decided not
to allow any correspondent from (the Review) and the sister
publication Asian Wall Street Journal to visit Singapore on social
visit passes,'' the statement said.
   It said Rodney Tasker, a Review correpondent, would not be
allowed to re-enter Singapore and Raphael Pura, a reporter for the
Asian Wall Street Journal, had been asked to leave.''
   Pura, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, has said immigration
officials let him enter Singapore Wednesday but ordered him to
leave by Thursday night.
   Tasker, the Review's chief correspondent, said in a telephone
interview he was refused entry last Wednesday when he arrived from
Bangkok, Thailand, at Singapore's Changi Airport. Both
correspondents were to cover general elections set for Sept. 3.
   The government restricted circulation of the Review and the
Asian Wall Street Journal last year, accusing correspondents of the
two publications of having engaged in activities of a political
nature.
   Both publications are subsidiaries of Dow Jones & Co., Inc., of
the United States.

<HEAD>Judge Certifies Smitherman As Winner Of Controversial Selma
Mayor's Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state circuit judge ruled Monday that the
city's white mayor won a seventh term, thwarting three black
members of the City Council who had refused to certify the victory.
   Cleophus Mann, one of the black councilmen and the runner-up to
Mayor Joe Smitherman in the Aug. 23 election, said he would appeal
the decision in federal court and also challenge the certified
results in Dallas County Circuit Court.
   ``I intend to challenge it (election) until something happens
where I can show my side,'' Mann said Monday night, referring to
his claim that Smitherman stole the election.
   Circuit Judge Charles Thigpen ruled in response to a lawsuit by
Smitherman that the mayor should be certified as the winner based
on results that showed him defeating Mann 3,752 to 2,769 votes. A
third candidate, Coy Darby, had 453 votes.
   Smitherman's re-election vote totals set off an angry reaction
by Mann's followers last week, including the arrest of two on
charges of disorderly conduct.
   The mayor said he was not surprised by the judge's ruling.
   ``I had expected it because there was no grounds for the City
Council not to certify it,'' said Smitherman, a former
segregationist who was first elected in 1964, one year before the
Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights march focused national attention
on the city.
   ``I guess he (Mann) figured whoever could get out in the middle
of the street and holler the loudest would get elected,'' the mayor
said.
   Smitherman had asked Thigpen to certify the election so
preparations could begin for a Sept. 13 runoff election to fill
seven seats on a new nine-member City Council.
   The current six-member panel was deadlocked over whether to
certify the results of Tuesday's election, with three black members
voting against certification and three white members voting in
favor.
   Smitherman, saying he was the ``straw man'' in a battle for the
leadership of Selma's black community, accused Mann of intimidating
the other two black councilmen into voting against certification.
   Attorney J.L. Chestnut, who represented black Councilmen Lorenzo
Harrison and Edwin Moss, said his clients ``were not going to vote
to certify with or without a court order. Now if the judge wants
to, that's his business.''
   Chestnut said none of the mayoral candidates addressed ``the
burning issue in this town, which is racism.''
   ``Everything over here is racial,'' he said in an interview
after Monday's court hearing. ``Whites turn out to vote only when
the white political leadership anticipates a large black turnout. .
.. They knew that was not going to be the case.''
   Smitherman, however, disputed that race should have been the
major issue in the mayor's campaign.
   ``Selma has made tremendous racial progress,'' he said, pointing
to the appointment of a black schools superintendent by a
predominately white school board.
   Mann's supporters claimed the race was closer than the official
tabulation and that there were irregularities at polling places.
They said Smitherman led Mann by only 3,043 to 2,743, with Darby
third at 453. Those results would have forced a runoff between Mann
and Smitherman.

   Troops raided hideouts in the Manila
suburb of Quezon City on Monday and arrested three renegade
soldiers believed linked to supporters of former President
Ferdinand Marcos, the military said.
   That brought to at least 12 the number of purported right-wing
activists seized in raids in Manila and elsewhere since Friday.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, commander of the National Capital
Regional Defense Command, said, however, that nine of the suspects
were released pending further investigation.
   He called the raids ``pre-emptive strikes'' to prevent another
coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.
   The military has been on full alert in the Manila area since
Saturday for Mrs. Aquino's visit to Brunei. She left for Brunei
Monday and is expected to return Wednesday.
   Military officials said troops seized 10 automatic rifles and
hundreds of rounds of ammunition in the raids Monday.
   Biazon said those arrested were believed linked to renegade
Brig. Gen. Jose Marie Zumel, a Marcos supporter and former
superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy who has been
sought since a coup attempt in January 1987.
   He did not give the names of the three men arrested.
   Brig. Gen. Galileo Kintanar, the armed forces' chief
intelligence officer, told a congressional committee Monday that
renegade soldiers pose a greater short-term threat to government
stability than do communist rebels, who have fought to topple the
government for nearly 20 years.
   After 20 years as president, Marcos was forced into exile by a
military-civilian uprising in February 1986 and he was replaced by
Mrs. Aquino.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross was
pressured by its vice president and the Swiss government during

   The charge comes from Professor Jean-Claude Favez, who was
invited by the Geneva-based Red Cross to examine its wartime
records and settle the Holocaust controversy that still shadows the
125-year-old organization.
   Red Cross Director-General Jacques Moreillon, who played a key
role in opening the files to Favez six years ago, says the
historian's verdict stems from hindsight and that a public appeal
by the Red Cross over the massacres of European Jews would have
jeopardized its humanitarian work in Nazi Germany.

   The EPA is legally required to move against Los Angeles because
an eight-month moratorium on pollution penalties expires at

give itself more time to revise and clarify the Clean Air Act.
   But negotiations over revising the law are stalled by

fathered. Revolutionary War-era records show that sex was ``part of
serious courtship'' and often resulted in premarital pregnancy, a
historian writes.
   Americans in the late 1700s ``were more licentious than we
imagine them to be,'' Jack Larkin writes in American Heritage
magazine's September-October issue.
   Larkin cites birth and marriage records of several dozen
American communities to prove that in the late 18th century,
pregnancy was frequently a prelude to marriage. In rural New
England, nearly a third of brides were already with child.

<HEAD>Asian Airports Tighten Security Against Possible Olympics
Terrorism</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asian airports have tightened security to prevent
acts of terrorism during the Summer Olympics in South Korea this
month.
   Authorities in Japan, Taiwan, Southeast Asia and all the way to
Australia, in addition to South Korea itself, are clamping down on
possible threats they believe could come from communist North
Korea, the Japanese Red Army, South Korean radicals or a host of
other quarters.
   ``Experts in terrorism are justified in concerning themselves
with every eventuality and every precaution should be taken to
preclude any threat, no matter what the source,'' Edward Derwinski,
U.S. undersecretary of state for security assistance, said recently
in Washington.
   Amid fears that terrorists could try to enter South Korea from
Japan, airports throughout Japan have intensified checks of
passengers and their baggage, frisking individuals twice and
sending them through two metal detectors before boarding planes.
   Japanese authorities have deployed special X-ray machines that
can detect plastic explosives, and immigration and customs
personnel have been increased to check of passports and carry-on
baggage.
   Japanese airlines are stepping up inspections of liquor bottles,
as explosives in such a liquor bottle were believed responsible for
the destruction of a Korean Air jetliner near Burma in November,
killing 115 people. A self-confessed North Korean agent said she
planted the explosives on board to disrupt the Sept. 17-Oct. 2
summer games in Seoul and presidential elections in South Korea
last year.
   Armed guards have been assigned to ferries operating between
Japan and South Korea, and Japan's coast guard is deploying some 80
percent of its patrol boats and planes to the Sea of Japan to
thwart potential smuggling of explosives and weapons into South
Korea.
   Several known or suspected Japanese Red Army members have been
arrested in recent months, some travelling on false passports. One
of them, Osamu Maruoka, was carrying a one-way ticket to Seoul,
South Korea's capital.
   ``He may have intended to set up a new cell there or to work
with one already in existence to stage terrorist attacks in South
Korea in conjunction with the Olympic Games,'' said the U.S. State
Department's annual report on terrorism.
   The Philippine military is closely watching airports to detect
terrorists, and immigration officials are carefully scrutinizing
entry of Korean nationals.
   ``It is a cooperative effort among the countries in this part of
the world to prevent the movement of known and identified
terrorists who may attempt to go to Korea and conduct terrorism,''
the Philippines military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de Villa, said.
   Police arrested one Red Army member in Manila this year who had
undergone radical plastic surgery, and others are suspected of
living in the Philippines for several years. Posters of suspected
Red Army members are displayed at Manila's airport, as well as at
airports in other Asian countries.
   Thailand began anti-terrorist measures Aug. 1 by deploying air
force commandos and a tank at Don Muang International Airport,
according to airport General Manager Charoon Peetong. Authorities
are exchanging information with other international agencies to
monitor potential threats, Charoon said.
   Other airports, such as Sukarno-Hatta in Jakarta, Indonesia;
Subang in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei,
Taiwan; Singapore's Changi, Hong Kong's Kai Tak, and Australian
airports, have no new measures and are relying on what they feel
are sufficient precautions. At Kai Tak in Hong Kong machine
gun-toting commandos routinely make patrols.
   None of the measures rival those taken in South Korea itself,
where authorities fear reprisals from neighboring North Korea after
its pleas to co-host the Summer Games were rejected by the
International Olympic Committee.
   At Seoul's Kimpo Airport, which has a reputation for some of the
strictest security at any commercial airport, passengers must go
through metal detectors when leaving planes. Troops in full battle
gear patrol regularly, and huge searchlights pan nearby fields at
night. Since November soldiers with submachine guns have been
patrolling Kimpo's departure lobby.
   The threat at Kimpo was highlighted in 1986 when, a few days
before the opening of the Asian Games, a bomb went off, killing
five people. Seoul blamed North Korea for that attack.
   South Korea is also concerned by North Korea's recent deployment
of surface-to-air missiles capable of hitting planes flying near
Kimpo.
   Korean Air bans passengers from bringing aboard liquor bottles _
except duty-free alcohol _ or batteries.

<DATELINE>SAN VIGILIO DI MAREBBE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With its chalets, pine
forests and oompah band, San Vigilio seems like any other Tyrolian
town, except for the little-known language its people speak.
   San Vigilio is a home of the Ladins, a tiny group of mountain
people clinging to a language traced to the ancient Romans who
conquered the valleys in what are now Italy's eastern Alps.
   The Ladins are officially recognized as the third language group
of the Alto Adige, a part of Italy that used to be Austria's South
Tyrol.
   As a minority, Ladins also speak German and Italian, the other
two official languages, and they have tried to steer clear of the
ethnic problems between those two groups.
   ``We are a minority competing with two foreign tongues,'' said
Lois Craffonara, director of a Ladin cultural institute. ``We are
different because of our language.''
   So far, the Ladin-speaking valleys in the Dolomites some 90
miles north of Venice have been spared the bombing campaign blamed
on German-speaking extremists seeking autonomy for the province
that was ceded to Italy after World War I.
   Thirteen bombs attributed to the extremists have gone off since
March, but none have caused deaths or serious injuries.
   The Ladins number only 18,000 in the Alto Adige, in contrast to
280,000 German-speakers and 124,000 Italian-speakers.
   There are 12,000 Ladins in two other Dolomite provinces, Trento
and Belluno, and an estimated 50,000 in Switzerland, according to
Craffonara. But only in the Alto Adige has there been an official
census.
   The Ladins include some of Italy's top skiers, Alpine guides and
woodcraftsmen, as well as two names known outside Italy _ Maria
Canins, a cross-country skier and cyclist considered one of the
world's leading women athletes, and Hollywood composer-songwriter
Giorgio Moroder, winner of three Academy Awards.
   Ladin is classified as belonging to the Rhaetian group of
Romance languages. The isolation of the Ladins in the mountainous
area has allowed the language to survive invasions through the
centuries _ the local hero, Caterina Lanz, used a pitchfork to
drive out French soldiers hiding in a cemetery in 1797.
   But the isolation has also hindered the language's spread. Ladin
speakers in San Vigilio would receive blank stares if they used
their language in the next valley, only a 15-minute drive over a
mountain pass.
   Ladin sounds like a mixture of French and Latin. It is
considered a sister language of French, Provencal, Catalan and
Italian.
   Craffonara and other experts say it has a rich vocabulary
although purists have lamented that modern words have crept into
the language.
   One major problem is the lack of a Ladin dictionary. Each valley
speaks a slightly different version and experts have been unable to
agree on a unified vocabulary.
   But Ladin speakers have been making gains in recent years.
   The first major Roman Catholic prayer book in Ladin was
published only in 1984. And Italy's state-run RAI-TV network just
this summer began broadcasting long-promised news and cultural
programs in the language on its regional channel.
   The biweekly newspaper Usc di Ladins (Voice of the Ladins)
greeted the move with the headline ``Finalmenter'' (Finally).
   Further recognition came when Pope John Paul II visited the area
in July and spoke in Ladin as well as German and Italian.
   Still Ladins complain that only in the Alto Adige have they
received any guarantees.
   By law, Ladin is taught in the public schools in Ladin villages
and at least one seat on the provincial council in Bolzano is set
aside for them.
   And benefitting from the strict ethnic guidelines in the
province, they are also guaranteed their share of government jobs
under a quota system put into effect to ensure that German speakers
keep the upper hand over the Italian speakers in the area.
   Under the regime of Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator who
ruled Italy from 1922 and into World War II, the Ladins suffered
alongside the German speakers.
   The Ladin valleys, which had been united under the
Austrian-Hungarian Empire, were divided up into different
provinces. While the speaking of German was forbidden and even
names on gravestones were Italianized, Ladin was considered no more
than an ``Italian dialect'' and Ladin speakers were encouraged to
emigrate elsewhere in Italy.
   Today, the Ladin areas are major tourist centers, attracting, in
particular, skiers and hikers. Up to now, there have only been
scattered ethnic incidents, involving the painting over of the
Italian names on road signs or the puncturing of tires of some cars
of Italian tourists.

<HEAD>Adoption Law Expected to Cut Back on Family Homes for Orphans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERESA ALBOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Changes in adoption laws designed to
curb illegal ``baby trade'' have restricted the ability of
foreigners to adopt Filipino youngsters and may mean that many will
spend their childhood in orphanages.
   New regulations, which took effect Aug. 3, ban adoptions of
Filipino children by foreigners residing in the country unless at
least one prospective parent is related to the child.
   Foreigners living abroad can still adopt Filipino children
through international agencies. But prospective parents living here
will have to return to their own country and file papers there
through an international agency.
   The procedure can take years, depending on the adoption laws in
the country where the papers are filed.
   Government figures indicate that in recent years about 17
percent of the 2,500 children adopted here annually have been taken
by foreigners residing in the Philippines and who were not related
to the child.
   More than a third of all adoptions of Filipino children are by
foreigners, including those who file papers abroad and would not be
affected by the changes.
   ``The new code is not anti-foreigner,'' said Lourdes Balanon,
assistant director of the government's Bureau of Child and Youth
Welfare. ``It is an effort by the government to protect our
children.''
   Ms. Balanon said that in the past foreigners could adopt
Filipino children in a few weeks. Previous regulations allowed
single foreigners to adopt with much less red tape than in the
United States or other countries.
   Ms. Balanon added that although many of the adoptive foreign
parents were of good character, others may have been fronts for
``baby trading'' _ selling youngsters to couples abroad who were
unable to have children.
   ``Mothers were convinced to give up their children, and even
kidnapping may have been encouraged,'' she said.
   Because local adoptions usually were arranged without the
services of an international agency, the government here had no way
of ensuring the child's welfare once the parents left the country.
   But some welfare workers fear the new regulations will
discourage legitimate adoptions by qualified foreign families,
living in a country without a tradition of taking in children who
are not related to those who adopt them.
   In Filipino society, adoption of children with no blood ties is
rare. Government figures show that in the past two years, only 5
percent of the children adopted here were taken by Filipino couples
who were not related by blood.
   Traditionally, orphans and children of impoverished parents
unable to care for them become the responsibility of the ``extended
family'' _ uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents.
   But children born out of wedlock are often kept secret from
their families.
   Abortion is technically illegal and birth control is frequently
shunned in this predominantly Roman Catholic country. Unwed mothers
find themselves under tremendous social pressure to turn their
infants over to religious or government orphanages.
   In other cases, extended families sometimes are too poor to take
in another child.
   ``Older children will be especially affected,'' said Lisa
Hechenova of the Asilio de San Vincente de Paul Orphange in Manila.
``Because if Filipinos adopt at all, they want infants. Foreigners
are more inclined to accept toddlers and even 6-to-10-year olds.''
   Jose, a 3-year-old toddler at Manila's Hospicio de San Jose
Orphanage, is one of those children who, because of new
regulations, may never have a home. He has been at the orphanage
for more than eight months because officials have had difficulty
finding him a home and the new changes in the law will make it even
more difficult.
   Seven-year-old Maria was among the last children adopted by a
resident foreign couple. She was given in July to a European couple.
   Maria said she never knew her natural parents.
   ``But I used to dream about them every night. Only they didn't
have faces.''

<HEAD>Ambitious Plans Transforming Cramped Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Catapulted into prominence as a center of
international business, Tokyo is undergoing major transformations
aimed at relieving its congestion, lack of affordable housing and
shortage of office space.
   Urban planners are focusing on skyscrapers and man-made islands
in Tokyo Bay as ways to modernize and open up vast areas to
development, especially for foreign firms clamoring for a place to
do business.
   The plans _ some bold, some bizarre, all urgent _ are designed
to provide business and living space and to hold down soaring land
prices.
   In Tokyo Bay, builders are already working on a futuristic
business-residential district on man-made islands, one of some 40
projects under way or planned for the bay.
   Several new subways and above-ground railways are worming their
way toward the jammed city center. Blueprints are being drawn for
massive waterfront development, and one firm plans to create a
floating office building out of a 35,000-ton ship.
   The Tokyo metropolitan government is moving across town, opening
up some choice downtown real estate.
   The national government is seriously studying moving its
bureaucracy out of Tokyo, possibly creating a new capital city.
   Twelve million people live in Tokyo's city limits, while Greater
Tokyo groans with 30 million people, a quarter of Japan's
population in 2 percent of its area.
   ``There's just not enough space,'' says Osamu Homma, a spokesman
for Mitsubishi Estate, Japan's second-largest real estate
developer. ``Buildings are taking up more of Tokyo, and residents
are getting kicked out.''
   The city, called Edo in feudal Japan, was made the capital in
1868. It grew rapidly but was virtually levelled by a severe
earthquake in 1923, and destroyed again by U.S. bombers in World
War II.
   It was rebuilt largely along its previous layout, with winding,
twisting roads that had deterred enemy attacks in old days on the
Shogun's castle in the city center.
   Today Tokyo is a labyrinth of nameless streets and tiny one-way
lanes. Few houses have gardens, and parking is a perennial headache.
   With Tokyo's rapid growth as an international
finance-information center on a par with New York and London, space
has become its most prized commodity.
   Central Tokyo land prices skyrocketed 96.6 percent last year
with choice downtown land selling for the equivalent of $6.7
billion an acre _ wiping out any dream the average Tokyoite might
have of owning a house in the city.
   ``Businesses and people are concentrated too much together,''
says Tokyo city planner Toshihiko Ogata. ``They must spread out to
other areas.''
   A plan gaining popularity is literally moving the capital out of
Tokyo.
   A pet project of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita is
decentralization, and the government has ordered 79 public offices
to leave Tokyo. Eventually all ministries could pack their bags and
open up low-rise downtown Tokyo to high-rise development.
   The city government, however, backs the most ambitious scheme to
be initiated so far, the sleek ``Tokyo Teleport'' now being built
on 1,107 acres of man-made islands in Tokyo Bay, just 3.7 miles
from downtown. It is to be finished by the year 2000 and cost $31.8
billion.
   The islands will be studded with ``intelligent'' buildings with
state-of-the-art automation, communications and
information-retrieval systems, hotels, and sports and shopping
plazas. It will provide homes for 60,000 people and offices for
110,000.
   Kisho Kurokawa, a prominent architect, feels the Teleport isn't
enough.
   In a magazine article in April, he proposed a huge man-made
island filling most of Tokyo Bay. It would have single-family homes
for 5 million people, at the yen equivalent of $270,000 each.
   ``The alternative ... is the slow but irresistible metamorphosis
of Tokyo into a concrete jungle lacking in human resonance,'' he
wrote.
   Japan's government offices could move to the 74,000-acre, $527
billion island to get them out of central Tokyo.
   ``Tokyo should expand inwards, not outwards,'' says Noboru
Hozumi, a Waseda University architecture professor. ``People are
psychologically drawn toward the center, but financially forced
further away.''
   High land prices mean most can't afford housing in or near Tokyo
and commute long distances on packed trains.
   Mitsubishi Estate has a dramatic proposal to turn the Marunouchi
business district around the Tokyo railroad station, where today
only one building stands higher than 10 stories, into a concrete
canyon of some 60 skyscrapers, 40 to 50 stories high.
   The $45 billion scheme would create more than 2.5 times the
current floorspace, allowing 200,000 more people to work in the
area, and keep the original red brick Tokyo station building, a
popular landmark.
   The idea is not embraced by the Tokyo government.
   ``Commuter trains are already packed, roads are jammed, there's
the problem of water supply,'' says planner Ogata. ``This plan will
make things worse.''
   But Mitsubishi claims to have thought everything through,
including treating water so it can be used two or three times
before running it off.
   ``We're proposing underpasses and such to deal with traffic, and
there are four new train lines scheduled to come into Marunouchi,''
spokesman Homma said. ``The plan is completely feasible and hardly
a dream, or we wouldn't have spent three years on it.''

   Color conversion of vintage black-and-white
films and television shows proceeds around the clock, but
filmmakers are still seeing red over what they call mutilation of
works of art and insist the fight isn't over.
   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner enraged directors last year when he
began releasing color-enhanced films from his huge MGM library,
ranging from ``The Maltese Falcon'' to ``Casablanca.''
   ``I own it, I'll do whatever I want,'' Turner said.
   Directors say the process perverts their original vision,
likening it to taking crayons to an Ansel Adams photograph. The
perceived desecration has also united them, said Charles Warn,
spokesman for the Directors Guild of America.
   ``What Ted Turner has done single-handedly through his arrogant
attempt to disfigure our film heritage is create the largest artist
rights' movement in history,'' Warn said.
   ``Turner has galvanized these feelings of artists and film
lovers everywhere. He has been a great favor to us despite his
great arrogance and greed.''
   With impassioned testimony from actor Jimmy Stewart, the guild
has managed to push through federal legislation creating a
government-appointed national film commission with powers over the
color-enhancement process.
   The U.S. Senate is expected to approve the measure in September
and President Reagan is expected to sign it into law by the end of
the month, Warn said.
   But the law, establishing a national film registry for movies
deemed culturally or historically significant, has been
substantially watered-down. Executives at Turner's color lab say it
will have no impact on them.
   ``It means absolutely nothing. All it means is that the
government has wedged itself into the arts, and that's
ridiculous,'' said Charles M. Powell, executive vice president of
Color Systems Technology Inc. in the Los Angeles suburb of Marina
del Rey.
   The original proposal specified that anyone who color-enhanced a
picture in the registry would be prohibited from showing the film
under its original title. But that provision was deleted.
   ``For those films,'' said Powell, ``we must put a crawl (notice)
at the beginning that the film was altered without original
filmmaker consent.''
   Color Systems president Buddy Young said his firm wouldn't
suffer under the law because the number of truly classic
black-and-white films is small and the number of film candidates
for color-enhancement is virtually unlimited.
   ``Our view of it is that Congress passing this legislation is an
important statement _ that preservation of our heritage is
important,'' Warn said. ``We view it as an important first step.
   ``This is not the end of the war, it is simply a battle that we
have won. The directors guild feels strongly that audiences have a
right to see the films as originally made, and moreover, the
artists have a moral right to have them seen in their original
form.''
   For audiences, however, there will be an abundance of colorized
movies, television shows and cartoons available on video cassette
and on TV, especially Turner's new Turner Broadcasting Network
(TBN) debuting this fall.
   Color Systems is working on 90 color-converted vintage films,
the cartoon series ``Felix the Cat'' and the TV series ``Abbott and
Costello.'' Also, the industry's other big color enhancer,
Toronto-based Colorization Inc. just announced plans to color 138
episodes of ``McHale's Navy.''
   By the end of October, Color Systems will finish tinting and
deliver to Columbia Pictures Television the movies ``The Corsican
Brothers,'' starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; ``Miss Annie Rooney,''
starring Shirley Temple; and the western ``Kit Carson.''
   Other black-and-white Color Systems titles being color-enhanced
for Columbia distribution within eight months include ``The Count
of Monte Cristo,'' ``The Man in the Iron Mask,'' ``The Last of the
Mohicans,'' ``Black Beauty,'' ``The Young in Heart'' and ``Black
Magic.''
   Color Systems first unveiled the process in 1985 with the
release of the color version of Christmas classic ``Miracle on 34th
Street.'' Moviemakers Frank Capra and John Huston led the hue and
cry over the treatment.
   Ironically, each time the classic Humphrey Bogart film ``The
African Queen'' is aired on television Color Systems Technology is
flooded with telephone calls complaining about the poor color
quality.
   ``And that movie was originally shot in color,'' said Powell.

   At a time when better management is seen as the
key to restoring American business competitiveness, some key
professors of management are earning close to a million dollars a
year as consultants.
   But, oddly, most of their counterparts in management research
are never sought out by business. Not only is business uninterested
in them and their ideas but, oddly, they may be equally indifferent
to business.
   The mutual disrespect stands in bold contrast to what is
happening in other areas of business education _ in accounting,
finance and sales and marketing _ where college professors are
having a field day as consultants.
   Why not management professors?
   The explanation, says one professor-consultant, lies in an odd
twist taken by management instruction back in the early 1970s that
took them away from the practical world of business into that of
sociology and psychology.
   Prof. Eugene Jennings of Michigan State University, a man who
for years has advised corporate chairmen and chief exectives and
who has at times actually taken the helm as chairman, traces the
phenomenon to the early 1970s.
   At that time, he says, consulting firms were so eager for
knowledgeable management people that they grabbed not just the
graduating classes but their professors, too. They drained the well.
   Deans of schools of management became so hard up, says Jennings,
they hired away sociologists and psychologists from other colleges
in the universities. They were able to succeed because they offered
higher salaries.
   But, says Jennings, these people were more interested in using
business to advance their understanding of psychology and sociology
than in using their disciplines to understand and inform business.
   In fact, says Jennings, author of many books on management, they
turned away from any commitment to business and developed instead
their own ethic ``that says anything to do with business,
especially research, is tainted.''
   They were more interested in organizational behavior than in
business behavior; they preferred to analyze management style
because they were unable to critique management substance; they
measured success by the correctness of methodology rather than the
relevancy of findings.
   They were not the first to become professional elites and
withdraw from the real world of practice, says Jennings. It
happened in medicine, law and education at one time or another.
   In each instance, he says, they left voids that needed to be
filled, and they were _ by osteopaths in medicine, by certified
public accountants in the field of law, by concerned, practical
teachers in education.
   The results of management professors turning their back on
business, says Jennings, are:
   1. Tremendous incomes and unusual stature for the relatively few
management professors with national standing as good researchers
and consultants. Moreover, these professors advise at the highest
levels in the corporation.
   2. A loss of constituency at business schools.
   Business schools seek funding from constituencies of graduates
and admirers in business. But, he says, ``these OB (organizational
behavior) people aren't capable of maintaining or building a
constituency.''
   As for the OB folks, Jennings contends they have evolved into
neither fish nor fowl, that they have an identity problem, that
they are frustrated by the difficulty of proving themselves, and
that they tend to be negative critics.
   Obviously no admirer, the professor contends they have created a
straw ideal of what constitutes good management, and use the ideal
to judge who is and who isn't acting correctly.
   For Jennings, there is some satisfaction in his analysis. He
recalls the time when he was honored at a famous institution for
his authorship of ``The Mobile Manager,'' a seminal work in
describing the corporation.
   The faculty of the great institution rose in applause, he said.
And then, he relates, he saw a cluster of professors ``sitting on
their fat ideals,'' their hands in their laps. They were OBs, of
course.

   Sixty-five years after a killer earthquake and
ensuing firestorms ravaged a crowded Tokyo, officials are alerting
people of the possibility of another massive one.
   They say it could come anytime between now and the next 20 years
and is expected to pack enough power to split the ground.
   The authorities are using the Sept. 1 anniversary of the 1923
Great Kanto Earthquake to organize information fairs and earthquake
drills _ and keep up vigilance among residents accustomed to
frequent, mostly harmless earthly shudders.
   ``We're constantly doing PR (public relations),'' said Takeshi
Yanagida of the Tokyo city government's Disaster Countermeasure
Bureau. ``Most people know enough to turn off the gas and keep
emergency supplies of food, water, money, underwear.
   ``In the event of a second Great Kanto Earthquake, what
authorities can do is limited. We need help from the people.''
   Much of Japan lies along a major fault at the juncture of
mammoth tectonic plates shifting slowly across the earth's surface.
Small earthquakes shake the country every day, most of them
unnoticed by humans. But to scientists maintaining a 24-hour watch,
they are signs of building pressure that must eventually culminate
in a powerful release.
   The resulting quake, they say, will likely register an 8 on the
open-ended Richter scale _ the Mexico City quake of 1985 measured
8.1 _ and will strike under or near the Kanto plain surrounding the
capital or along the crowded, 170-mile Tokai belt linking Tokyo and
the western city of Nagoya.
   ``In the worst-case scenario, the quake will come on a winter
evening when people are cooking their dinners, a day with a dry
northeasterly wind of about 22 kilometers per hour (14 mph),''
Yanagida said.
   Powerful enough to buckle walls and knock people off their feet,
it could set off fires from gas ranges and heaters that would burn
half a million homes, destroy one-third of Tokyo's living and
office space, kill 37,000 people and injure 78,000 more, scientists
say. A quake along the Tokai belt could kill up to 100,000.
   The tolls, while disastrous, would still be only a fraction of
the human cost of the 1923 disaster.
   Two minutes before noon on Sept. 1, 1923, the earth rose in a
violent upheaval. (Experts say that if the Richter scale had been
developed at the time it would have registered 7.8.) The earthquake
toppled houses and scattered embers from cooking fires, sparking
deadly firestorms that swept the capital region's rickety, densely
packed neighborhoods. When the embers had cooled, as many as
140,000 people had perished, mostly in the fires, and billions of
dollars worth of property lay in ruins or badly damaged.
   Masatoshi Rachi, then a 13-year-old farmer's son in eastern
Tokyo, recalled watching the firestorms approach after his family's
house had withstood the tremor.
   ``All around, sparks were falling like rain. People were
climbing onto their roofs and wetting them down,'' he said.
   ``Those who had lost their homes were setting up barracks,
finding space with relatives. Our house, which fortunately didn't
burn, was so full there was only room enough for people to sit _ 70
or 80 in all, relatives and strangers.''
   Rachi is now 78. Tougher building standards, fire and changes of
business have forced him to rebuild his home five times. Each time,
though, he has taken care to reinforce beams _ and to prepare a
parcel with stores of water, food, a flashlight, medicine.
   Rachi was not alone in learning lessons from the 1923 disaster.
The government restricted use of building bricks, stiffened
regulations on securing window glass and encouraged pioneering
architecture and engineering that allow skyscrapers to roll and
sway instead of buckling during tremors.
   It sent teams to study the devastation after the 1971 Los
Angeles quake, when highways collapsed, and the one that shook
Mexico's capital three years ago bringing on massive confusion
among families searching for their missing.
   Tokyo now has sturdier supports for its elevated highways and is
experimenting with a wireless system for emergency communications.
Recent experience has taught the Japanese they are likely to be
safer indoors during a quake.
   But despite the funds the government has poured into earthquake
prediction, ``The truth is, we're not 100 percent sure we can
predict the big one,'' said Hirofumi Yokoyama of the Meteorological
Agency's Earthquake Prediction division. ``We can be maybe 80
percent certain.
   ``The system is such that we should be able to predict a large
Kanto quake two or three days in advance,'' he said. ``We can't
tell exactly when, but we can say about where.''
   With luck, the information will be enough to prevent a
full-scale repetition of the catastrophe 65 years ago. Under an
advanced disaster-control program, trains will stop when a
tremendous quake occurs, public address systems will be triggered
automatically, people will congregate with their emergency kits at
government-designated sites and roadways will be cleared for
emergency vehicles.
   But the unknown element looms.
   ``I'm terrified of quakes,'' said the Tokyo government's
Yanagida. ``They're not like typhoons, which you can at least see.
Earthquakes can intensify after they start.
   ``The thing is, you just never know.''

<HEAD>Mexico's Conservatives Gear Up for Crucial Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition conservative party is
seeking to attract apathetic voters for upcoming local elections in
Mexico to rebuild its reputation following a third-place finish in
Mexico's presidential balloting in July.
   Although the National Action Party, or PAN, traditionally
Mexico's leading opposition, maintains its presidential showing
resulted largely through vote fraud, its leaders here and in other
regions are looking for new supporters for local elections in
November and next year.
   ``The PAN has a good product to sell to citizens but I think
what's been missing is the knowledge of how to sell it,'' said Raul
Monter, PAN committee president in Monterrey, the Nuevo Leon state
capital and northern Mexico's largest city with 2.8 million people.
   Municipal elections are scheduled for Nuevo Leon state Nov. 9
and these are seen as a crucial test for the PAN.
   ``It's a problem of better organization, better preparation,''
said Guillermo Prieto, PAN's president in northern Chihuahua state,
where mayoral elections are set for next year.
   The government's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won
the July 6 presidential election with just barely more than 50
percent of the vote. But it was an upstart center-left coalition
led by PRI-defector Cuauhtemoc Cardenas that loosened the PRI's
tight grip on power in Mexico for 59 years.
   The Cardenas front took 31 percent of the presidential vote and
won four Senate seats, a first-ever feat for an opposition ticket
against the PRI.
   At the same time, the PAN refuses to accept the presidential
results on grounds of alleged PRI vote rigging.
   While PAN joins the Cardenas opposition in formal protests
against the PRI, it still contends that the center-left coalition
did so well in July because it is part of the ``PRI-government''
system.
   ``The government had to create an opposition to receive votes
from those who are discontent with the system, to let them have
triumphs they never would have given the PAN,'' said Pablo Emilio
Madero, PAN president for Nuevo Leon.
   The PAN, which is nearly 50 years old, professes to be the only
party that can cleanse Mexico of government corruption, which it
says is the root of the current economic crisis and inadequate
infrastructure necessary for development.
   With that platform, the PAN has won dozens of mayoral victories,
especially in the northern states.
   At one time the PAN held mayoralties representing 75 percent of
the Chihuahua state population.
   But it never has won a governorship in any of Mexico's 31
states, and in most recent mayoral elections the PRI has
steamrolled back to power.
   The result is that supporters who might ordinarily vote for PAN
often stay home on election day in the belief they had little hope
of victory against the PRI.
   ``The government achieves two goals when it commits voter
fraud,'' claimed Madero. ``It wins elections and it discourages
citizen participation.''
   Yet as candidate selection progresses for Nuevo Leon's mayoral
elections, party leaders are acknowledging their failure to develop
a strong grassroots organization.
   ``We need to go to the people, go to small meetings so the
people can express their doubts,'' Madero said in an interview.
``We need to convince more people to work for the party.''
   Teresa Garcia de Madero, a Nuevo Leon state legislator who is
seeking the nomination as PAN mayoral candidate for Monterrey, said
the party needs candidates ``who don't campaign from behind a
desk.''
   Yet the PAN's ability to get candidates at all is an achievement
in itself.
   The PAN refuses to accept government funds available to all
opposition parties, opting to raise money through donations or
raffles. Most candidates finance their own campaigns, eliminating
those who come from modest backgrounds.
   ``Entering the PAN is not good business,'' said Ms. Garcia.
   PRI candidates, meanwhile, have the unlimited backing of the
government treasury, and government employees are recruited to work
for the party.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A valley in Peru that is the world's largest
single source of coca leaf is the focus of the latest strategy in
the United States' faltering war against the cocaine trade.
American authorities want to eradicate the coca plants with a
powerful herbicide. But that plan is meeting a lot of resistance,
for economic as well as environmental reasons.

   Smoke from burning jungle obscures the
sky above Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, cradle of the world's
cocaine trade and site of a much-debated U.S. experiment to stamp
it out with a powerful herbicide.
   From a police helicopter flying over the valley, thousands of
bright green fields of coca, the raw material of cocaine, are
visible through the haze. The plots, the labor of tens of thousands
of peasants who have burned off the hillsides, stand out clearly
against the dark mat of surrounding tropical foliage.
   Also visible from the air are dozens of illegal landing strips
cut into the jungle to accommodate the small planes that daily pick
up shipments of semi-refined cocaine for final processing in
neighboring Colombia.
   The Upper Huallaga Valley stretches 150 miles north of this
ramshackle town, located on the jungle-draped eastern slopes of the
Andes Mountains, 230 miles northeast of Lima.
   The valley is the world's largest single source of coca leaf. As
such it is the focus of the latest strategy in the United States'
faltering war against the cocaine trade.
   The U.S. government is testing Tebuthiuron, an herbicide known
commercially as Spike, against coca bushes in a one-acre plot on a
steep valley slope. Preliminary results show the chemical to be
deadly against the tough coca plant. Aerial application is to be
tried next.
   If that proves effective and if the U.S. government can resolve
a dispute with the herbicide's producer, Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis, about the safety of the chemical, the first program
of large-scale eradication of coca plants could follow.
   ``Ten years ago I wouldn't have said this, but interdiction
alone will not stop the flow of cocaine into the United States,''
says Craig Chretien, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's operation in Peru.
   American officials have sought to reassure Peruvians of the
safety of Spike, citing studies that indicate the herbicide is less
toxic to humans than aspirin.
   But both Peruvian and foreign environmental advocates are
warning that the use of a strong herbicide in the fragile jungle
eco-system is a dangerous gamble.
   They fear its long-term consequences and some predict the
destruction of all plant life in a region of great agricultural
potential already ravaged by the cocaine industry.
   Critics also contend that the Spike project is politically
motivated _ that the Reagan administration is seeking
``spectacular'' results in the drive against cocaine during an
election year, with little regard for the ecological implications.
   ``The questions raised by persons concerned about the impact on
the environment are perfectly legitimate. That's what we're trying
to determine with testing locally,'' U.S. Ambassador Alexander
Watson said in a recent meeting with American correspondents.
   In neighboring Bolivia, which with Peru accounts for more than
90 percent of the world's coca leaf production, Foreign Minister
Guillermo Bedregal has said his country will not be a ``guinea
pig'' for experimentation with toxic herbicides.
   But the center-left government of President Alan Garcia, in dire
need of U.S. economic aid, has indicated its willingness to attempt
herbicide eradication in Peru if it is convinced the herbicide is
not harmful to other plants, animals and human beings.
   ``The Peruvian government is willing to use herbicides and is
going to use them. They are the only weapon we have left against
drug traffickers,'' says a senior official in Peru's anti-drug
effort, speaking on condition he not be identified by name.
   Cultivation of coca in Peru has soared dramatically from 40,000
acres in 1974 to between 250,000 and 400,000 acres today.
   The increase has come despite a 5-year-old American-financed
manual eradication program. U.S. officials say manual eradication
of plants is too slow and too dangerous because workers are exposed
to attacks by the hired gunmen of the drug barons and by Maoist
Shining Path rebels who prowl the valley.
   Thirty-four members of eradication teams have been killed in
recent years, and in 1987 the 460 workers in the program pulled up
only 876 acres of plants.
   The 3-year-old Garcia administration has tried to disrupt the
marketing network of Peruvian and Colombian drug organizations. But
American drug officials, while praising Peru's commitment, say the
efforts have been frustrated by the far greater resources of the
cocaine lords.
   Since 1985, a special anti-narcotics police force has
confiscated nearly 100 tons of semi-refined cocaine paste, burned
770 crude jungle labs for producing paste, and dynamited more than
170 clandestine airstrips, according to Gen. Juan Zarate, head of
the narcotics unit.
   But the drug gangs have quickly repaired the dirt runways, often
within 24 hours, using well-paid work crews of local villagers and
sometimes even earth-moving tractors, Zarate said in an interview.
   The campaign against cocaine ran into a new obstacle since the
fanatical Shining Path guerrillas extended their presence in the
Upper Huallaga Valley in early 1987.

   The guerrillas now control large areas of the valley. They have
exploited resentment of the manual eradication program to win
support among peasants growing coca.
   Even more dangerous from the government's viewpoint is the
informal alliance that has developed between the rebels and the
local drug lords. U.S. officials, police and peasants say the
rebels are building up a multimillion-dollar war chest with
earnings from the drug trade.
   Counterinsurgency officials believe the explosive combination of
subversion and cocaine trafficking may have played a role in
Garcia's decision to allow the United States to begin testing
herbicides in the Upper Huallaga last October.
   Tests were begun with 30 herbicides. Eventually, U.S.
researchers concluded that Spike was the most effective and safest.
   Now they want to try aerial application of Spike in pellet form
to see how accurately planes can drop them on coca fields, most of
them smaller than an acre and interspersed with jungle. Spraying
has been ruled out because the liquid might be blown to surrounding
areas.
   U.S. officials say the aerial testing is ``on hold'' until the
U.S. government can resolve its dispute with Lilly. The company
announced in late May that because of ``a number of practical and
policy considerations'' it would not sell Spike for use in Peru
against coca.
   State department officials say that Lilly is worried about
reprisals from international drug traffickers and that the company
also fears lawsuits for any ecological damage.
   The company stands by Spike's safety if used as directed against
brush in grasslands in the U.S. West _ the purpose for which it was
designed _ but not as an herbicide against coca in Peru's jungle.
   A pamphlet distributed with the herbicide warns that it will
kill trees and shrubs if their roots come in contact with it.
   ``The problem is that Spike is not designed specifically for
coca,'' says Edgar Machado, an agronomy professor at the National
Agrarian University in Lima and Peru's leading expert on coca.
   ``Any broadleaf plant that comes in contact with Spike is going
to die, and broadleaf plants make up 98 percent of the jungle. The
exposed soil will be washed away by the valley's torrential rains.
The erosion will be terrible,'' Machado says.
   But U.S. Embassy officials argue that the Upper Huallaga is
already being destroyed by the cocaine industry and the only way to
save it for future agricultural use is to wipe out coca
cultivation. ``That's not a pristine jungle out there,'' Watson
says.
   Studies by Peruvian experts say that more than 1.7 million acres
of tropical forest have been destroyed by peasants clearing land
since the coca boom began in the 1970s.
   A flight over the valley seems to bear this out. From the air,
parts of the region look as though they have been bombed. Hill
after hill is peeled of vegetation. Millions of fallen tree trunks
present a picture of devastation.
   At least 150 rivers in the Upper Huallaga Valley have suffered
perhaps irreparable damage from chemicals used to process cocaine
paste in jungle labs. Many species of fish already have
disappeared, according to a study by Buenaventura Marcelo, a
professor at the National Agrarian University.
   Since 1970, cocaine paste producers have dumped millions of
gallons of sulfuric acid, acetone and other toxic chemicals into
streams that flow into the Amazon, Marcelo says, creating ``a grave
threat to the survival of the region's rich aquatic resources.''
   Although the debate on the use of a potent herbicide has
centered on ecological damage, Peru's government must also consider
the economic and social consequences of destroying illegal coca
cultivation.
   U.S. drug experts estimate that cocaine trafficking generates at
least $700 million annually for Peru, a sum equal to nearly 30
percent of the country's legal export earnings.
   With Peru mired in its worst economic troubles of the century,
many Peruvians wonder whether the country can afford to wipe out
coca cultivation.
   ``If this bankrupt nation has dollars circulating on the
streets, it is because of drug trafficking,'' Machado says. ``It is
not in anyone's interest to kill the goose that lays the golden
eggs.''
   Some 200,000 peasants have migrated to the Upper Huallaga Valley
in the past two decades to grow coca because they can earn 10 times
as much from it as from other crops.
   Some government officials believe that if coca is eradicated in
the Upper Huallaga without a program to help the peasants, they
will migrate elsewhere, cut down more trees and plant more coca.
That would also create resentment that the Shining Path would be
quick to exploit.
   In San Pedro, a cluster of a dozen shacks alongside a dirt
airstrip lost in the jungle 60 miles north of Tingo Maria, Guzman
Tamamuro already is bitter toward the government.
   As he watched police troopers burn a small pile of his drying
coca leaves, Tamamuro said:
   ``I'm just a poor man trying to feed my family. They think all
of us are big `cocaleros.' But they are wrong. Why don't they just
burn us up with the coca and be done with it?''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Contrary to many New Yorkers' notions, ``the
super'' was not invented in their town. But like everything else in
the Big Apple, he's a member of a widly varying species. He can be
a tyrant who turns predator around Christmas time. He can also be
crisply professional and super-efficient.

   He's ``the super,'' sometimes more like a mayor
of a small town, an observant shrink, a cat rescuer, mouse
undertaker, burglar chaser. He's an arbiter, detective, middleman
and ultimately the guy whose fault it is when anything goes wrong.
The buck stops there. Sometimes literally.
   The species is most annoyed to be called a janitor.
   Its natural habitat is New York City, where complaining about
one's super is just about second to complaints about the weather,
but migrations have been noted as highrises proliferate across the
country. Their reputations vary as widely as stockbrokers' and sink
as low as used-car salesmen's huckstering a misaligned bionic
wonder.
   There's the drunken lout scenario, true enough in some cases.
There's the crowd who speak Yugoslav, Greek, Moroccan and perchance
Esperanto, but ``no English, please.'' There's the guy whose hand
assumes the palm-up position before lips purse into the ``hello''
position.
   There are those who, while required to live in the building by
law, moonlight elsewhere during working hours. Sightings of such
supers are as rare as those of flamingos on the Bering Strait.
   But there are supers who are ordinary folks, guys just doing a
rather complex job. Joe Thomas is one such super, a family man with
three daughters, a New Yorker whose first job was pedaling 400
pounds of potatoes across the isle of Manhattan from a West Side
Italian vegetable stand to a fancy East Side restaurant.
   He's a man who believes strongly in doing things the
old-fashioned way.
   He also really goes beyond the call of duty to help the citizens
of his domain.
   In some ways, he's a boy wonder. Now 31, he's already overseeing
his second building, the current one a 22-story highrise near
Lincoln Center which houses about 1,000 persons in 375 apartments.
   He has been there five years, kows all residents at least by
sight, and admits there are a few who won't speak to him. He just
continues to say hello to them. About 60 percent of the apartments
are cooperatives, the remainder rentals.
   He supervises a staff of 10 doormen, porters and handymen. In
1987, he was named ``Super of the Year'' by the large real estate
firm that employs about 150 supers for its buildings. He received a
savings bond and a plaque. Being the kind of the man he is, he went
out and bought a second plaque.
   It said ``Staff of the Year.''
   The staff liked that.
   Not that things are always smooth.
   ``Sometimes I think I'm running a kindergarten,'' says Joe.
``Everybody is mad at everybody.''
   Thomas grew up in Hell's Kitchen, where his father, who always
worked two jobs to make ends meet, split when Joe was 10. Joe
married at 18, a girl named Ellen he met when he was 11.
   His wife's father was, and still is, a super and Joe got his
training from him.
   ``He broke me in with no mercy. He had me painting in 35-degree
weather when the paint was like molasses. He had me clearing drain
lines when I didn't know all the sewage would come down on me after
I broke through. But I learned how to do a lot of things.''
   He got his first building at 21, very young, and he chased quite
a few burglars from the back of the terraces, much to his wife's
distress.
   ``I'd get a report and go charging into the apartment. Luckily,
always too late. One night, when the cops were called, I saw them
go after a prowler with their guns drawn and I thought, `What am I
doing charging in unarmed?'''
   He doesn't do that any more.
   His most awful moment, he says, was when he was asked to go into
an apartment of a man who hadn't shown up for work that day.
   ``I just had a terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach when I
turned the key in the lock. I can't tell you why. I just knew it
was going to be bad. Sure enough, the place had been ransacked, but
there was no sign of the missing gentlemen. As we were about to
leave, we saw a pile of blankets.

   ``I pulled them back and there he was. Beaten to death.''
   He has found three bodies in all, the others old folks who lived
and died alone.
   Occupational hazards vary.
   Joe went to a woman's apartment to fix the air-conditioner. She
double-locked the door and asked him to remove his shoes, which are
in fact, boots, troublesome to unlace. He said no. The
air-conditioner was working fine.
   ``Oh thank you,'' she said. ``Let me give you something.'' No
need, said Joe.
   Whereupon, she grabbed him at the door and planted a big kiss on
his neck. He raced straight to his own apartment _ lunch at home is
one of the perks of the job.
   He avoids family problems and anything else that's not against
the law. He has never inquired, for instance, why one resident is
sometimes spotted sitting in the lobby waiting to be picked up as
he moves tarantulas in and out of the building.
   ``It's not against the law and nobody complains,'' says Joe.
   ``I'm essentially a middle-man and I'm in the middle of
everything already. I believe in live and let live.''
   Joe is discreet about the foibles of his over-extended family.
But sitting in his office one gets clues.
   He's negotating a roach-problem settlement on the telephone with
management.
   ``But you know her,'' he says. ``She'll have us in court in two
days if something isn't covered right.''
   His biggest gripe is when he or his staff go way above the call
of duty and the resident acts as though they were private servants.
   ``I once froze my ears off getting a taxi for someone and she
gave the driver a $5 bill for stopping. She gave me a quarter. I
would have preferred that she had just said, `Thank you.'''
   His other gripe is when he tries to take his family out for
dinner and 10 people stop him before he can get five feet away from
the building. There is a book at the front desk for complaints.
   Joe theoretically works from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. This is not to
say that Joe is a recluse after 4:30. He has rescued a snarling and
angry pet cat which tumbled into the building courtyard. He has
played the part of a cat burglar at 3 a.m. when someone locked
himself out.
   ``They lived on the 17th floor and I know the people on the 16th
floor weren't home. So I took a ladder up to their terrace, climbed
i and jumped the last two feet and caught onto the window. I

   Lesser supers would have said, ``Call the locksmith.''
   A very elderly woman needed help when there was a foul-up in the
schedule of her round-the-clock nurses. Joe picked her up when she
fell; his wife undressed her and put her to bed, and Joe's sister
came over to spend the night with her.
   ``The biggest pain in the job is getting contractors to work the

   A lot of Thomas' work is overseeing the contracts that go
anywhere from $100,000 to $600,000 worth of work in a given year.
   He has had his share of kickback offers.
   ``I don't do business that way,'' he says. ``Supers that take
kickbacks have homes in the Hamptons.''
   He likes to keep his family as private as possible and most
residents, he says, don't even know his wife on sight.
   ``They're not on the payroll.''
   His eldest daughter, 12-year-old Michelle, picks up some pocket
change by babysitting cats, dogs and kids.
   ``That's a normal thing for a girl of that age to do, so it's
all right by me,'' says Joe.
   The family also includes daughters Karen, 10, and Kelly, 9, as
well as ``Rags,'' an adorable mutt.
   Joe loves to fish and boasts he's one of the few fathers around
with three daughters who bait hooks themselves. He has taken the
kids to Disney World and fishing on the ocean and in streams and
ponds upstate and in Connecticut.

   His ``Renaldo and Clara'' didn't
exactly do big box office a decade ago, but Bob Dylan wants to
become a movie producer again, this time backing non-mainstream
productions by other writers.
   ``I'm talking with some people about starting a production
company where people can submit material that they think would not
be considered by the established studios _ young writers who might
have ideas for TV shows and film,'' he said in a recent interview.
``We're going to option books, comedy, dramas, it doesn't matter.
Anything creative.''
   Dylan was producer-director-writer-actor-editor on the 1978
``Renaldo and Clara,'' which marked the film debut of his friend
and sometime collaborator Sam Shepard. The overlong, surrealistic
account of the Rolling Thunder Revue tour also starred Joan Baez,
Arlo Guthrie, Allen Ginsberg, Harry Dean Stanton, Joni Mitchell,
Dylan's ex-wife, Sara, and just about everyone else on the tour.
But Dylan got good notices with an offbeat bit part in the 1973 Sam
Peckinpah film ``Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.'' He wrote
``Knockin' on Heaven's Door'' for the movie.
   ``I had to make that movie with almost a gun pointed at my
head,'' he said with a laugh. ``Originally, I was just going to
write the music and the song and then we got down to Mexico, and it
was impossible to get out. And Sam Peckinpah who directed that
movie was a real tyrant, a lovable tyrant. And he says, `You're
gonna be in this movie,' and I didn't have much choice.''
   Dylan recently did another acting turn, playing a reclusive rock
star in the feature film ``Hearts of Fire,'' but the movie has
never been released. The director, Richard Marquand (``Jagged
Edge''), died not long after its completion.
   ``He wanted me to be in that movie, I couldn't understand why,''
said Dylan. ``But he convinced me that I'd be good in it, and he
wanted me and only me. I had time at that time, and I did it, and I
enjoyed working with some people in there. (Co-star) Rupert Everett
was fantastic. ... We got to just like improvise things. I wasn't
really all that comfortable with standing in front of the camera
and having to give reactions. That made me feel kinda stupid. But I
enjoyed working with Rupert.''
   Dylan said he never saw the completed film.
   In fact, he doesn't see very many movies. But he did like
Pee-wee Herman's ``Big Top Pee-wee.'' This unexpected revelation
draws an expectable response. ``See? You actually laugh. I went
with a friend who said it was a joke,'' he said. ``I thought it was
good, though. It had such a strange perception of reality. First of
all, the guy's got a talkin' pig. Once you get beyond that, that
the pig talks, it's a natural thing, you know?
   ``The circus ringmaster had a wife that could stand in his hand.
I thought that was really incredible. I thought it was really
allegorical, you know, and the color was brightly unreal. You can't
compare it to `War and Peace.'''

   The French Revolution's bicentennial is coming up
next year, with fireworks, political and historical squabbles,
commemorative underwear and miniature guillotines all part of the
show.
   The festivities are designed to peak July 14 on the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison in 1789, the
most memorable event of the long and turbulent revolutionary years.
   Even in a normal year, Bastille Day celebrations of military
regalia on the Champs-Elysees, dancing in local fire halls and
fireworks in the skies mark July 14 in Paris and provincial towns _
similar to the American 4th of July.
   But organizers are working frantically to make 1989's events
unforgettable.
   They admit to being far behind schedule, partly because both the
first man chosen to head the Bicentennial Mission, businessman
Michel Baroin, and his successor, centrist politician Edgar Faure,
died shortly after taking office, leaving the agency leaderless
until this past May.
   Jean-Noel Jeanneney, the new president of the bicentennial
operation, told reporters recently after meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand that he hoped to have his plans spelled out by
the end of September.
   ``When you have less time to do things, you do them in less
time,'' Jeanneney said. ``Many great events that went down in
history were prepared in extreme haste.''
   The planning was also hung up in political feuding during the
past two years, when the conservative government of Jacques Chirac
was jousting with Mitterrand, a Socialist.
   After Mitterrand's re-election in May and the installation of
Socialist Michel Rocard as premier, the mission's budget was nearly
tripled, to the franc equivalent of about $20 million.
   Chirac, who remains involved in the bicentennial as mayor of
Paris, recently said he had the feeling the Socialists ``want to
profit from this commemoration by emphasizing certain historical
aspects in the presentation, to the detriment of the consensus that
Michel Baroin and Edgar Faure were promoting.''
   The French Revolution has been a focus for political divisions
ever since it began, and the approach of the bicentennial renewed
the debate over what, exactly, was being celebrated.
   There are many variations of the Revolution, but in broad terms
French rightists are likely to say they approve of the abolition of
the nobility's privileges in 1789 and the establishment of the
republic in 1792, but are appalled by the mass executions of the
Terror in 1793-94.
   Some French leftists argue that people should take the
Revolution as an undivided whole _ and be for it or against it.
They suggest that rightists picking and choosing among elements of
the Revolution are closet counter-revolutionaries.
   ``It's surprising that, two centuries later, the founding act of
the Republic remains a propaganda tool and a source of partisan
quarrels and polemics, but it's also a consequence of the
revolutionary heritage itself,'' the independent newspaper Le Monde
wrote in a front-page article summing up the squabbles.
   A poll published in the conservative weekly Le Figaro Magazine
found that, when asked to name which events best symbolize the
Revolution, 74 percent of French people said the Declaration of the
Rights of Man on Oct. 2, 1789, with only 55 percent choosing the
bloody July 14 assault on the Bastille prison.
   Although the Bastille was a hated symbol of repression, and once
housed political prisoners, the revolutionary crowd that
overwhelmed its defenders found only seven inmates to be freed:
four men convicted of fraud, two lunatics, and a nobleman, the
count de Salages, who was imprisoned for incest.
   Le Figaro's poll also found 61 percent saying King Louis XVI
should not have been beheaded at the guillotine, while 14 percent
maintained it was the right thing to do and 25 percent had no
opinion.
   The U.S. bicentennial did not turn up many Americans who thought
the American Revolution was a bad thing, but in France some people
are still against the whole idea of their own uprising.
   ``We think it was a revolt against God and not just a revolt
against power,'' said Jean-Baptiste Chaumeil, a member of a group
hoping to make a counter-revolutionary demonstration Aug. 15, 1989,
at Place de la Concorde _ where the guillotine stood _ one of the
biggest events of the bicentennial year.
   Chaumeil said the group, called Association 15 Aout 1989 (August
15 Association), includes both Royalists, who want France to have a
king again, and Republicans, who oppose any return to the monarchy
but find a celebration of the Revolution's anti-church policies
distasteful.
   For the past year, a monthly newsletter called ``L'Anti-89'' has
been recalling the dark side of the Revolution, especially its
harsh suppression of Roman Catholic clergy.
   The group is distributing a poster showing a revolutionary
carrying a guillotined head on a spike and asks, ``Are We REALLY
Going To Celebrate That?''
   In fact, miniature guillotines for sale as souvenirs are among
the many commercial spinoffs of the bicentennial.
   Textile manufacturer CET has obtained permission to use the
official bicentennial logo, showing three blue-white-and-red doves
in flight, on a line of clothing, and CET director Christian
Mariolle said he expects the T-shirt and the underpants to be the
best-sellers, both in France and as an export.
   The Bastille itself was demolished, but its bells survived and
will be part of an exhibition of revolutionary artifacts touring
the country next year.
   Plans are being laid for elaborate operas at Versailles and for
coverting the Tuileries Gardens between the Louvre and the Place de
la Concorde into a collection of pavilions, games, and expositions
on the bicentennial.
   On a more scholarly note, the weekly Livres-Hebdo counted 205
books on the Revolution to be published before the celebration is
over. Hundreds of colloquiums and seminars have been announced, on
topics ranging from ``The French Revolution and Revolutionary
Vandalism'' to ``The Revolution and Childrens's Books.''
   The bicentennial year will also see the completion of several
major building projects started by Mitterrand early in his first
term _ a new Opera House at the Bastille site, the controversial
glass pyramid of architect I.M. Pei at the Louvre, and a giant
cube-shaped arch under construction at the Western edge of the
city, on a direct line of sight with the Place de la Concorde and
the Arc de Triomphe.
   The new triumphal arch's crosspiece, when open, is to house a
Center for the Study of the Rights of Man, which is supposed to
keep the bicentennial spirit alive in years to come.
   Mitterrand will be busy, both inaugurating his buildings and
welcoming visiting heads of state.
   Next year is France's turn to be host for the economic summit of
leaders of the seven richest industrial democracies and Mitterrand
has persuaded his peers to make the dates July 14-16, rather than
in June, as usual. The new president of the United States will be
one of the seven.
   Mitterrand says he will also invite many other government
leaders, especially from Latin America and the Third World, to come
to Paris at the same time and join in the celebrations.

   Regina Rocha has one of the best
views in the world. From her home she can look out at famed Sugar
Loaf mountain at the entrance to Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay,
the towering Christ of Corcovado with outstretched arms overlooking
the city and the luxury apartments far below on the Atlantic Ocean.
   It's a picture-postcard every day.
   But a view is about all Regina Rocha has. She is poor and her
home is a sour-smelling, one-room wooden shack beside a sewage
ditch.
   She lives in one of the hundreds of slums known as favelas on
the hillsides and outskirts of the city.
   Mrs. Rocha, 38, and her four children are typical of millions of
Brazilians in the slums, trapped between the poverty and despair of
Brazil's underdevelopment and the prosperity of a small influential
elite.
   But unrest is growing in the favelas like hers, and authorities
and academics say it poses a threat to Brazil's three-year-old
civilian government.
   Crime and violence, often drug-related, are on the rise, and
some officials say a type of ``civil war'' already exists between
the traditionally complacent slum dwellers and the shrinking middle
and upper classes.
   In Rio, protesting residents of the huge Rocinha hillside favela
twice this year blocked the main road connecting downtown to
wealthy residential beach districts and battled police.
   ``This is the beginning of informal civil war between slum
dwellers and Brazil's elite,'' Mayor Roberto Saturnio Braga of Rio
de Janeiro said in an interview. ``Poverty and social injustice are
at the root of the new violence.''
   Sen. Afonso Arinos de Melo Franco, a former Cabinet minister and
widely respected as Brazil's elder statesman, recently told the
Congress in Brasilia, ``We are seeing a new and special type of
urban warfare. It is based on neither ideology nor religion, but on
empty violence.''
   On paper, Brazil has the Western world's eighth-largest economy,
behind Italy and above Spain. But according to the World Bank,
income distribution is the most unequal anywhere. The 1 percent
richest Brazilians own as much as the poorest 50 percent together,
while 65 percent of the 144 million population lives in misery on
less than $90 monthly, according to government figures.
   The roots of inequality in Brazil go back 400 years, when the
Portuguese crown handed out huge tracts of land to trusted officers
and created an elite class of landowners.
   But the split deepened during the ``economic miracle'' of rapid
growth in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The military government
then in power decided the best way to encourage development was to
``concentrate the wealth'' in the hands of the upper classes, and
the gap between rich and poor widened.
   The gap is perhaps most evident in Rio, Brazil's second-largest
city with 10 million people.
   Over the past 30 years, Rio has lost the federal capital to
Brasilia and banks and industry to Sao Paulo, the nation's largest
city. Rio today can't generate enough jobs or revenues to attend
its population, and slums have nearly tripled in size since 1960.
   Today, an estimated 2 million people live in 450 illegal
shantytowns built on the slopes of steep hills that jut up
throughout the city. About 4 million more live in slums on the
city's outskirts, most of them unemployed migrants from the
drought-prone Northeast.
   The picture is similar in other Brazilian cities. In Sao Paulo,
Brazil's economic and industrial center, at least 7.5 million of
the 13 million inhabitants live in precarious conditions.
Nationwide, 71 percent of Brazilians have no running water, while
85 percent are not hooked up to sewage lines, according to
government figures.
   Mrs. Rocha, a small woman, earns the equivalent of $60 monthly
as a health worker in her slum and supports two teen-age boys and
two grade school-age children. More than three-quarters of her
income goes to buy rice, beans, eggs and an occasional piece of
meat, she said.
   She lives atop the Santa Marta shantytown, a community of 10,000
on a steep hillside slope not far from downtown Rio. Rubbish lines
the rat-infested paths that weave between fragile scrap wood and
brick shanties. The stench from the sewage and rotting garbage is
close to unbearable.
   In Mrs. Rocha's shack, two faded color photographs liven the
chaos of sacks and clothes strewn between the tiny stove, bursting
closet and single bed _ her only possessions.
   But not even her jumbled home is a refuge from the misery and
violence that surround her.

   Police brandishing submachine guns and other weapons daily scour
the dank winding alleys and piggyback shanties for petty thieves
and drugs. Mrs. Rocha's two oldest sons _ 14 and 16 years old _ are
regularly searched for stolen goods or drugs as they make their way
up the steep winding hillside steps, she said.
   ``I hardly even notice anymore when the police barge into my
home looking for something,'' she said. ``I'm even used to the guns
and shootouts. We just close the door and wait for the gun battles
to end.''
   A major shootout between bandits and police in September, 1987,
lasted a week.
   In Rocinha, a similar hillside shantytown of 250,000,
inhabitants walk a mile or more to fetch water. It has just two
doctors, two schools accommodating only 1,500 of the 10,000
school-age children, one small police post and no federal
representatives despite its size.
   But for many, the slum in Rio's prosperous South zone is a
luxury and rents have soared beyond the reach of many residents,
who work mostly in the wealthy South Zone neighborhoods as maids,
office clerks or manual laborers.
   Rio's slum life, however, is an improvement for some.
   ``Our life is better here than it was in Ceara,'' said Aguinaldo
da Silva, who two years ago brought his wife and three children
from Ceara state in the Northeastern drought region to stay with
relatives in Rio. ``At least here we have water, I can find odd
jobs and we can eat every day.''
   For inhabitants of Rio's hillside communities, the return to
civilian government has been a hollow triumph.
   ``It's ridiculous to talk about democracy here,'' the Rev.
Thierry de Linardt, a Roman Catholic priest, said in an interview.
``It's like talking about Camembert to someone who has never tasted
cheese.''
   ``People have no sense of citizenship,'' he added. ``Their needs
are so vast they can't afford to question the government or anyone
who might help them. Poverty is used to political advantage.''
   De Linardt said the lack of an effective social welfare system
has opened doors for drug traffickers in the slums.
   In the absence of a government presence, drug kingpins have
taken control of slum communities and often serve as protectors
under a law of their own. Twenty elite drug chiefs employ some
40,000 people city-wide and have been known to help out needy
families and keep petty thieves away.
   Youths often are attracted to them and the police are seen as
enemies.
   ``Kids growing up in slums are looking for recipes, for
immediate relief from a desperate situation,'' de Linardt said.
``They're treated with violence and they respond with violence.
We're creating a generation who understand only the language of
violence.''
   ``The government is shutting off all other channels for slum
youths,'' Itamar Silva, spokesman for the Santa Marta community
said in an interview.
   Late last year, Rocinha dwellers marched down from the hillside
to protest the imprisonment of slum baron Denis Leandro da Silva
and in a night-long battle with police, closed off the principal
tunnel from the city center to prosperous suburbs, smashing cars
trying to get through.
   Earlier this year, slum inhabitants occupied a government-owned
plot of land near Rocinha and marked out areas to build new homes,
arguing they could no longer pay the high rents. When police tried
to remove them, they once again blocked traffic and battled police
with sticks and stones.
   ``Five more years without a clear social program and serious
public sector investments and collective life in Rio will be
impossible,'' said a leading sociologist, Helio Jaguaribe. ``No
democracy will be able to withstand the chaos.''

   Muscovites call them ``priyezhayushi'' _ the
arrivals, hordes of peasant women who pour into Moscow on morning
trains and special buses, with empty satchels they hope to fill
with groceries for their families in the provinces.
   They are said to number more than a million on any given day _
adding to Moscow's resident population of 9 million _ and are
testimony to what is euphemistically referred to as ``the food
situation,'' a chain of shortage, inequity and waste that keeps
most Soviets on a diet of bread and potatoes.
   Every man, woman and child eats two-thirds of a pound of
potatoes each day and 13 ounces of bread, according to government
figures.
   Soviets also eat 25 percent more sugar than recommended in the
1982 food program composed by the Communist Party's agricultural
secretary at the time and the nation's leader now, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. That is twice as much per person as the average American.
   In reality, the diet of rural Soviets is even more dependent on
starches than the figures suggest. Much of the Soviet Union's meat
and fresh fruit is sent to special stores that cater to officials,
big trade unions and foreigners, leaving little but fatty sausage
behind for sale outside major cities.
   The best supplies of most things are to be found in Moscow, but
living in the capital guarantees little for the everyday citizen.
   ``It's not correct to say that there is a shortage of meat now.
There is a virtual absence of meat,'' complained Vera Kudryavtseva,
a 42-year-old wife and mother living in Moscow. ``Sometimes you get
lucky and run into a line for meat on your way home from work. But
if you go out looking for it, you can't find it anywhere.''
   She and Soviet homemakers across this country of 280 million
people contend that it is even harder now than a decade ago to put
a decent meal on the table. The daily newspaper Selskaya Zhizn said
in late August that rural Soviets now eat less meat, eggs, potatoes
and fruit than they did five years ago.
   That's a serious problem for General Secretary Gorbachev who has
said that improved living conditions will be a major measure of his
program to reform the Soviet economy.
   Lagging farm output and a generally inadequate diet is largely
laid to farm collectivization, the drive initiated by Josef V.
Stalin in 1929 that tore peasants from the land, some contend
irrevocably.
   But the recent worsening of food availability can also be
attributed to new influences that are the byproducts of Gorbachev's
reform. Soviet consumers have been hoarding some foods in fear of
major price increases, and a switch in management and planning
approaches to encourage more local autonomy has in some areas
created confusion and slowed output.
   The shortages may also be more apparent now because glasnost,
Gorbachev's policy of greater openness about social problems, has
opened discussion of inadequate production on gigantic state farms
for six decades.
   As part of his reform program, Gorbachev has been trying to
instill incentive and personal pride in Soviet farmers by allowing
families and cooperative brigades to lease state land for
smaller-scale operations.
   Calling for broader use of leasing and family farming, he
contended in a speech to the party leadership in late July that
``there is nothing non-socialist in this.''
   But media reports have exposed the outright resentment some
Soviets have for those who succeed at it.
   The weekly newspaper Moscow News reported in July that three
fires destroyed a prosperous pig farm in the village of Saltykovka
about 20 miles from central Moscow, and that arson was suspected
because of the fears of local residents that the farm posed an
environmental and ideological threat.
   But Moscow News added: ``The most vigilant of the Saltykovka
residents smelled a different kind of odor: the pernicious spirit
of profit-making and capitalism.
   ``Meat has not been on sale in Saltykova shops for some time now
... but this doesn't mean at all that the 700 inhabitants of the
settlement are vegetarians. No, they eat meat, but meat bought in
Moscow.''
   Inadequate storage and transport and a mass exodus of young
Soviets from rural areas have slowed progress in food production
and distribution.
   A third of the grain crop still is lost between harvest and
milling, according to U.S. government estimates. Gorbachev himself
conceded in March that at least a quarter of the harvest is lost or
ruined each year.
   Food not lost in harvest or transport also is distributed
according to overly centralized and often illogical plans.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported that of the 16,000
tons of meat the city of Kaluga is ordered to deliver yearly to
consumers in Moscow, 100 miles to the northeast, 7,000 tons are
bought back by Kaluga residents who spend a whole day traveling to
and from the capital _ like the ``priyezhayushi.''
   Distribution of fresh foods is so haphazard that even store
managers seldom know when produce will arrive.

   Be prepared. Nothing, but nothing can escape
home video _ not even the Boy Scouts.
   Paramount Home Video plans to release ``The Boy Scout
Advancement Program'' next month. The seven-part series is based on
``The Official Boy Scout Handbook,'' the number two best seller of
all time, rivaled only by the Bible.
   The first three videocassettes in the series, to be marketed in
VHS and Beta for $24.95 each, cover Tenderfoot, Second Class and
First Class scouts, and include wilderness training, pitching
tents, first aid, hiking, meterology, conservation, safe swimming,
map making and advanced tracking. The rest of the series will be
available later.
   The programs were shot on location in cities and wilderness
areas throughout the United States.
   Elsewhere, the Video Software Dealers Association has named
``Dirty Dancing'' video of the year and ``Top Gun'' the
best-selling videocassette of the year. ``Lady and the Tramp'' was
the year's best children's video, ``Gone With the Wind'' the best
video classic and ``Hope and Glory'' best foreign movie video.
   Others named for VSDA awards were: ``Crocodile Dundee''
(comedy); ``Fatal Attraction'' (drama); ``The Lost Boys'' (horror);
``Dirty Dancing'' (musical); ``Predator'' (science fiction);
``Callanetics'' (fitness); ``Pink Floyd _ The Wall'' (music video);
``Wrestlemania IV'' (sports); ``Miami Spice'' (adult).
   VSDA represents more than 3,000 retailers, distributors and home
video suppliers in the United States.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``Aloha Summer,'' and ``Trains,
Planes and Automobiles'' and ``Moonstruck.''

   ``Aloha Summer'' (Lorimar Home Video; VHS-Beta, $79.95; Rated PG)
   
   The temptation is very strong to dismiss ``Aloha Summer'' as
another silly summer surf-and-skin flick. But this film, one man's
recollection of the summer of 1959 spent in Hawaii, tries _ and
sometimes succeeds _ to be more.
   The trouble is that it's hard to be both a light beach romp and
a serious look at the summer when six teen-age boys learned ``how
to surf and how to be ourselves,'' as the narrator says.
   Much of director Tommy Lee Wallace's movie is predictable, but
there also is racism and conflicts involving generation gaps and
independence, which young audiences should understand and
appreciate.
   The movie concerns six unlikely pals _ two white kids from the
mainland, one rich, one working-class; a Japanese boy and his
cousin, who lives in Hawaii; and two Hawaiians. They find it far
easier than their parents and other adults to cross the social and
economic lines between them.
   Some of the conflicts arise when the rich kid falls in love with
a Hawaiian girl, angering his parents and her brother; the Japanese
boy fails to hold to the standards set by his samurai father; and
the Hawaiians see the good and bad of the mainlanders who invade
the island.
   There are few surprises and one can guess how most of the
conflicts are resolved. There also are gorgeous, exciting scenes of
surfing. The performances are fine, though none is a standout.

   ``Planes, Trains and Automobiles'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS,
$89.95; Beta, $29.95; Rated R)
   
   No filmmaker did cross-country travel better on screen than
Alfred Hitchcock when he brilliantly directed ``North by
Northwest'' in 1959 with an ounce of wit and a speck of adventure.
John Hughes' ``Planes, Trains and Automobiles'' doesn't even rate a
close fourth.
   As a comedy of errors and misadventures, ``Planes'' fails
miserably, largely because what is presented as humor leaves one
uncomfortable, fuming and puzzled. The setups are stupid rather
than funny; the characters pathetic rather than amusing.
   Steve Martin plays Neal Page, an advertising executive on a New
York business trip. He leaves for his home in Chicago right before
the Thanksgiving holiday. A simple, two-hour trip by airplane,
right? Wrong.
   His plight begins when he tries to get a taxi in midtown
Manhattan at the height of the evening rush hour. The guy has to be
out of his gourd to even think he'd see a cab in his dreams, let
alone on the streets of New York. He finally reaches the airport
only to find that his first-class seat has been given away, and
he's stuck in coach with an obese, crass curtain ring salesman
named Del Griffith (John Candy) as his seat mate.
   When the plane is rerouted to Kansas because of snowed, Griffith
suggests they spend the night at a seedy motel and try and leave in
the morning instead of remaining at the airport.
   Thus begins the trek and the justification for the movie's title.
   Only a moron would make the decisions Page does, certainly not a
well-traveled Chicago businessmen. It's painful to watch.
   Martin and Candy, who virtually are alone in this yawn of a
flick, work well enough with a thin script by John Hughes, whose
previous works include such vapid adolescent excursions as ``Pretty
in Pink'' and ``Some Kind of Wonderful.'' Their chemistry produces
the movie's only redeeming virtue: the full meaning of friendship.
   The pacing is slow, and Hughes' direction meanders. No easy
riders, these. _ By Dolores Barclay, AP Arts Editor.

   ``Moonstruck'' (MGM@UA Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated PG)
   
   ``Moonstruck'' casts its magic at home as well as in the
theater. It's the anecdote for whatever ails you.
   In addition to its buoyantly sweet look at the tribulations of
life, there are wonderful performances in Norman Jewison's 1987
romantic comedy, including Cher's Academy Award-winning portrayal
of Loretta Castorini, a dowdy widowed accountant about to be
married to the wrong man.
   Olympia Dukakis won the supporting actress Oscar for her role as
Loretta's mother. Others bewitched by the moon over Brooklyn
include actors Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, Vincent Gardenia, John
Mahoney, Julie Bovasso, Louis Guss and a pack of howling dogs.
   When Loretta is sent to her fiance's brother to repair the ``bad
blood'' between the men, she begins falling hopelessly in love. As
that is sorted out, Loretta's parents and their extended
Italian-American family work out troubles of their own under the
spell ``la luna'' casts over Brooklyn.
   John Patrick Shanley's clever and sophisticated script, in which
the actors almost seem to wink at the audience as they speak their
lines, won him the movie's third Academy Award.
   It's a story you can watch over and over and still have fun.

   ``Gregory Hines'' (CBS) _ Gregory Hines
   
   It pays to know the right people.
   Gregory Hines, a popular actor and dancer, has released a
catchy, listenable collection of dance songs and ballads. But the
album's success has far more to do with
songwriter-producer-arranger-friend Luther Vandross than with
Hines' rather bland singing.
   Vandross helped introduce Hines to the pop music world last year
when they did a duet on ``There's Nothing Better Than Love.'' Now
Vandross takes friendship one step further by wrapping Hines' voice
around seven new songs.
   Hines has a high, thin voice that lacks the timbre of great soul
singers such as Vandross. Perhaps Vandross knows this. Hines' voice
is often buried amidst a batallion of backup singers and only on
``This Is What I Believe'' does he get a chance to stretch out.
   If Vandross wants to promote a singer's career, he might try
ex-Crystal Darlene Love, who sings backup on ``Gregory Hines.''
   ``That Girl Wants to Dance With Me'' is a hit single and
``There's Nothing Better Than Love'' is also included.

   ``Perfect Machine'' (Columbia) _ Herbie Hancock
   
   The title of this record says it all _ a machine could have made
much of it, and in fact often does.
   Hancock, a jazz veteran who pioneered the jazz-rock fusion
style, plays no less than 12 different keyboards on ``Perfect
Machine,'' nearly all programmed by computer.
   It may be state of the art, but it doesn't have much soul.
   The six songs on ``Perfect Machine'' are neatly divided into
three complex instrumentals _ full of distorted voices and
insect-like buzzes, pops and pings _ and three funkier pieces with
vocals by Sugarfoot of the Ohio Players.
   Of the instrumentals, ``Maiden Voyage-B.Pop'' is the best,
featuring some fret-popping bass from William ``Bootsy'' Collins
and two sweeping, eloquent piano solos by Hancock. ``Perfect
Machine'' features a slashing keyboard melody in its stop-start,
mechanical rhythm, while ``Chemical Residue'' is a meandering piece
full of whispery computer voices.
   Collins and Sugarfoot step to the forefront on the three vocal
tracks, all of which are eminently danceable. ``Beat Wise,'' which
kicks off Side 2, has Collins at his thunderous best, putting some
real life into the record. ``Obsession'' continues Hancock's
herky-jerky keyboard exercises, while ``Vibe Alive'' brings up
Sugarfoot's yowling vocals.
   As a dance record, ``Perfect Machine'' would work just fine
cranked up to top volume. As technology, it may be a milestone.
   But as jazz, rock or funk _ or any combination thereof _ it's as
sterile as a computer chip.

   ``Heavy Nova'' (EMI Manhattan) _ Robert Palmer
   
   Long-sought success is sweet, but it can also prove unduly
seductive.
   Ask Robert Palmer. After years of cult figure status, releasing
an occasional irresistible song to a mostly indifferent public,
hits such as ``Addicted to Love'' made this British veteran an
established star.
   With the new ``Heavy Nova,'' he faces the challenge of keeping
that star on the rise.
   Unfortunately, Palmer takes the easy route. Everything about the
single, ``Simply Irresistible,'' from the chunka-chunka Power
Station beat to the reprise of beautiful women pouting in the
video, smells like a rip-off. Even more annoying, he's ripping off
himself.
   It leaves a bad taste that ``Heavy Nova'' doesn't have the
strength to recover from, despite some admirable attempts at
stretching out.
   ``More Than Ever'' is a noisy car wreck of a song. The attempt
at crossing cultures in ``Change His Ways,'' which mixes yodeling,
a rollicking accordion and a vocal riff lifted from ``The Lion
Sleeps Tonight,'' sounds like a confused airline terminal on a hot
day.
   Palmer's at his best when he relaxes and lets his good taste
take over. ``She Makes My Day'' is a first-rate pop song that
easily eclipses everything on this record. ``Disturbing Behavior,''
which gives Palmer the chance to show off his strong, soulful
voice, is another success.
   If he'd trusted these instincts a little more, ``Heavy Nova''
would have been better.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Don Johnson on Don Johnson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don Johnson is faced with carving out a
feature film career following his huge success with TV's ``Miami
Vice.''
   And he's becoming rather philosophical about it all.
   ``If James Stewart or Henry Fonda were in my position today and
they could pick any film they wanted, what would they pick? What
would they do? I figured out they'd get ... out of the business.
There wasn't really anything they'd want to do,'' he said.
   Like Michael J. Fox, Bruce Willis and other TV stars, Johnson
was flooded with offers from film producers seeking to transmit his
Sonny Crockett allure to theatrical attractions.
   ``I was offered a lot of what I call affectionately `body-count'
pictures,'' said Johnson. ``By page three, I've snuffed 12 to 15
people. I just wasn't interested. I really believe that people
aren't interested, either. I like action-adventure pictures, but I
think there's an over-abundance of them.''
   Instead, he chose ``Sweet Hearts Dance,'' in which he wields
nothing more lethal than a fly rod. The movie, which is being
released this month by TriStar, casts him as a small-town New
England builder whose marriage to Susan Sarandon is drifting into
boredom and atrophy. The intensely human script by Ernest Thompson
(``On Golden Pond'') deals with relationships among husband and
wife and friends, played by Jeff Daniels and Elizabeth Perkins.
   Don Johnson waited until after three seasons of ``Miami Vice''
before undertaking a feature _ he had made the little-noticed
``Cease Fire,'' before starting the series.
   ``I wanted to find something that had a sense of humor to it,
that in a breath you would laugh and you would cry, that would be
about people, about us, about what we do, about our feelings,'' he
said in an interview.
   ``What is the single most important personal crisis facing all
of us in the 20th century? I think I found that in `Sweet Hearts
Dance.' It's a film about us, about our feelings, about how we have
figured out how to go to the moon but we can't figure out how to
talk to each other. We don't know how to say what we feel about
each other.
   ``We don't know how to maintain relationships, how to stay out
of divorce courts, myself included (he had two youthful annulments,
one divorce). I'm not being self-righteous about this. The most
important thing we can do for the remainder of this century is to
figure out how ... to love each other.''
   Pretty heady stuff from the guy with the roughneck reputation _
or so the scandal tabloids would have us believe. Johnson has been
fair game ever since ``Miami Vice'' hit the home screen in a burst
of pastels in the fall of 1984. Coverage accelerated when he and
Barbra Streisand became an item. Johnson has been known to be
touchy about incursions on his privacy, but he seems to have
mellowed.
   ``It's a difficult thing to deal with, and I would be lying if I
said it wasn't,'' he said. ``I try to keep a sense of humor about
it and just say the alternative is not acceptable in my business.''
   The Don Johnson saga has been well picked-over by the tabloids,
as well as the more respectable national press: How he was born
Dec. 15, 1950, to a farmer and beautician in Galena, Mo.; his
juvenile delinquency; leaving home at 16; falling in love with
acting in a high school production of ``West Side Story.''
   After winning a scholarship to the University of Kansas, Johnson
plunged into drama. He later studied at the American Conservatory
Theater in San Francisco, and began finding stage and film roles in
Hollywood. Frustrated by failure and rejection, he became a ``major
party animal'' in the 1970s, falling into alcohol and drug abuse
that helped slow his progress.
   Did he ever think he'd never make it as an actor?
   ``Many, many times,'' he said. ``But I made a decision early on
that I did this (acting) because I love it. Whether or not I became
rich and famous was not the criteria for doing it. There were two
reasons: One, I'm not qualified for anything else; and two, it's
what I love to do.
   ``An artist doesn't paint to be represented by Sotheby's. If he
becomes an artist of renown, though maybe not in his lifetime, his
paintings will bring great sums of money. But he paints because he
must paint. And I felt I must act.''

<HEAD>The Artists: The Heavenly Glass of Rufino Tamayo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a stained-glass mouse it.
   Rufino Tamayo's ``The Universe,'' a 600-square-foot, 3.8-ton
window, is the lone work of art in a specially designed museum in
this northern industrial city.
   The recently dedicated Universe Pavilion at Monterrey's Alfa
Cultural Center is itself an architectual masterpiece, a glimmering
aluminum cylinder that narrows at the far end to focus attention on
the giant window.
   However, Tamayo's genius, his interpretation of outer space, is
poetry in glass.
   Tamayo's colorful ``Universe'' is filled with shooting stars and
soaring comets, a black hole, constellations and planets, all
against the blue background of eternal night.
   ``This is a window to Tamayo's personal cosmos,'' said Alfonso
Martinez Serna, director of the cultural center.
   Tamayo, renowned for the use of color in his paintings,
incorporated 50 shades of blues, purples, reds, greens, violets,
siennas, yellows and pinks to portray a universe that glows.
   To achieve the stunning dimensions of the mural and eliminate
the lead unions common to stained-glass, he sent for Dutch
technicians who had developed a special process of melting and
layering glass.
   Prisms of colored glass up to five inches thick, some created in
ovens as hot as 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit (900 degrees Celsius) were
layered using clear chemical resins, then chipped with band saws to
split the light.
   The combined result of the artist's design and the refracted
light is a cosmos in motion.
   For nearly eight months Tamayo and the crew worked in Mexico
City to piece together the window's 30 panels using silicon resins
instead of lead.
   ``The result is a monolithic crystal,'' said Martinez. ``It
looks like one piece of glass.''
   Tamayo, obviously pleased with the finished product, has said it
is unique in the world.
   ``I don't have any problem with saying that there is no other
mural in the world like this, neither in dimension nor in artistic
quality,'' the artist said while the work was on temporary display
in Mexico City's Museum of Modern Art in 1984.
   The Monterrey conglomerate Alfa commissioned Tamayo to do a
stained-glass mural in 1981, although the theme was left up to the
artist to decide. Tamayo, whose fascination with outer space often
has been revealed in his paintings and sculptures, chose the
universe.
   The mural originally was intended for Alfa's corporate
headquarters in this city of 2.8 million people, a center for
Mexican private enterprise.
   But 1981 was the year before the company fell into severe
economic crisis along with the rest of Mexico. By the time the
mural was finished in 1982, Alfa was in financial trouble.
   The mural, according to the artist, was put up for sale,
although the price never has been disclosed and Martinez did not
say when Alfa finally purchased the mural.
   ``I would like the government to buy the mural,'' the
88-year-old artist said. ``There are places to put it. There are
empty churches, or a type of chapel could be built where people
could visit simply to medidate.''
   However, said the artist whose paintings and sculptures are on
display throughout the world, ``I don't think it should leave
Mexico. I think it's a very important work for the artistic
heritage of Mexico.''
   Except for a brief exhibition in Mexico City, the giant work of
art had been stored in a warehouse, Martinez said.
   Alfa, which last year renegotiated its massive foreign debt by,
in part, trading away company stock, is once again making money. To
commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Alfa Cultural Center,
Monterrey's hands-on science and techology museum built by the
company in its heyday, Alfa last year began construction on the
Universe Pavilion.
   The 100-foot-long hall on the cultural center grounds is
designed and subtly lighted to draw attention to its one work of
art.
   ``The building had to be conceived in a very special way so the
stained glass could be appreciated at a distance,'' said Martinez.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No more growing pains for New Edition. After
years of legal and personal problems, the five-man vocal group is
ready to enjoy its success.
   ``Being young and coming into the business, you just sign your
name on dotted lines,'' group member Ralph Tresvant said recently
in an interview. ``We got caught out there at a young age. We were
forced to grow up a lot quicker and we found out things people
didn't think we'd ever find out.
   ``Now we're back on the right track.''
   A ``new'' New Edition can be heard on their latest album,
``Heartbreak.'' Original member Bobby Brown left in 1987 to pursue
a solo career and was replaced by Johnny Gill, best known for his
duet with Stacy Lattislaw, ``Perfect Combination.''
   Gill says he had little trouble fitting in. ``We'd known each
other a long time. They didn't have to get to know me.''
   Along with Gill and Tresvant, New Edition consists of Ricky
Bell, Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe. Although Gill, 22, is the
oldest member, New Edition had been around long enough to have a
wary approach towards the music business.
   ``I don't think you really look for a friend in the music
industry; I don't think you can find one,'' Tresvant said. ``You
get someone that likes you and you get along with and they're
working for you and working with you. You basically just have to
look at them as a business relationship.''
   New Edition, then teen-agers, became known nationally in 1983
with ``Candy G`Mr. Telephone Man,'' problems arose.
   Maurice Starr, New Edition's former producer, filed suit,
claiming he had the legal rights to their name. A Boston judge
later ruled in New Edition's favor. Brown left for a solo career
and the group did not record for a year and a half.
   The legal difficulties took their toll on New Edition. Tresvant
wrote the song ``Competition,'' which appears on ``Heartbreak,''
and chronicles the group's dissension.
   ``There was a lot of separation in the group, pairing off and
doing things that weren't a group thing,'' Tresvant said. ``I just
wanted to write about what was happening and what we were doing to
each other. I just pictured what each person would say if he tried
to explain how he felt.
   ``I made it sound like an overall world problem to disguise what
was happening, but when we listened to it, we knew what it really
was.''
   ``Heartbreak'' was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the
Minneapolis-based music moguls who have worked with Janet Jackson,
Morris Day, Human League and Alexander O'Neal. Bivins says the
group used a different approach in recording  this album to be about the
different things we've
been through and our different personalities.
   ``It just started from basic conversation with Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis and taking our conversation and putting them into song
form and calling it a concept album.''
   Gill says ``Heartbreak'' was not originally planned as a
``concept album.''
   ``It's something that just happened. If you go halfway into the
album, you wouldn't really understand it. It's sort of like a
book.''
   Gill credits Jam and Lewis with setting a comfortable
atmosphere. ``They took enough time to get to know us and they
basically structured all the songs around us, instead of just
having us go and sing.''
   Bell appreciated the producers' direct approach: ``They don't
smile in your face and then behind the scenes cut some kind of deal
or make a move. They're real up front. I got a chance to be myself
up there. That's part of the feel they brought up.''
   Jam and Lewis wrote ``If It Isn't Love,'' the album's first
single, which resembles the group's earlier hits.
   ``That was written by them based on what they had heard from New
Edition in the past,'' Tresvant said. ``That was the only song they
had already written.''
   Bivins says Jam and Lewis encouraged the group to produce their
own material. Tresvant wrote ``Competition'' and the compact disc
version of ``Heartbreak'' contains two more original songs.
   ``Before we went down into the studio with Jimmy and Terry, they
requested we go into the studio for a few days and just come up
with songs written by ourselves,'' Bivins said.
   ``Terry and Jimmy know the meaning of the group,'' DeVoe added.
   Tresvant hopes ``Heartbreak'' will gives fans a chance to know
the group better. ``That's what the album is about, `The New
Edition Story.' Those are songs that Jam felt we should sing.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Opry Veteran Del Reeves A Showman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Grand Ole Opry veteran Del Reeves is a
singer, songwriter, musician, impressionist, humorist, television
star and actor. He recently thought about an appropriate epitaph.
   ``I want to be remembered as a great showman and a nice guy,''
he said. ``That's all I could hope for.''
   The amiable 54-year-old performer entertains about 1 million
people a year as one of the most popular acts on the Grand Ole
Opry, a 62-year-old live country music show.
   He's been appearing on the show for 22 years, fulfilling a
childhood dream as he grew up the youngest of 11 siblings in
Sparta, N.C.
   ``I listened on the radio on Saturday nights and it was the
ultimate,'' he said in an interview. ``As a child, I told my daddy
I was going to sing on the Opry one day. He said, `Yeah, sure you
are.' I kept my goal in mind and in '66 we achieved it.''
   He's currently involved in several projects, including an album
entitled ``Opry Legends.'' He and such fellow Opry stars as Little
Jimmy Dickens will record an album whose proceeds will go toward an
Opry retirement fund.
   ``I'd like to see this be a success for my fellow man,'' Reeves
said. ``I'll do everything I can to make it a success. I'd like to
see that accomplished more than a No. 1 record.''
   He's formed a production company within the past year to help
aspiring singers record their songs and get professional advice
without being ripped off. He wears a ring commemorating the Opry's
50th birthday and hopes a protege will eventually get the Opry's
100th birthday ring.
   ``I want them to get that ring and say, `Del Reeves helped me
get this,''' he said.
   Reeves is especially known to Opry fans for his impressions of
actors _ Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan _ and fellow country
stars Johnny Cash, Roy Acuff, Hank Snow and Dickens.
   ``I'd try these out on the band on the road,'' he recalled. ``If
they laughed, I knew I had it. It's been a lot of hard work. I
spent a lot of time doing (perfecting) them.''
   He admires the impressions of Rich Little and envies the time
Little apparently has to concentrate on them. ``He's darned good.
He's had more time to rehearse and practice them than me. I had to
learn 2,000 songs plus do impersonations. He doesn't do (Johnny)
Cash too good, but the rest are fantastic.''
   Reeves turned to impressions and light material early in his
career when he found those more to his liking than ballads.
   ``I couldn't really sell a ballad,'' he said. ``It had to be
material on the lighter side. Under this clown's face, there's a
serious guy. But I never got to show it because I got tagged as
that clown. I've been clowning as long as I can remember.''
   One of the breezier songs was his recent recording, ``Dear Dr.
Ruth,'' about sex counselor Ruth Westheimer. He appeared on her TV
show to talk about country music and recalled the effect his humor
had on her: ``She fell plumb off that little box she sits on.''
   Del Reeves, named after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
began singing and playing guitar as a small boy. By the time he was
12, he was playing with a band on a regular Saturday radio show. He
had four brothers who left their guitars at home to serve in World
War II. He began playing the instruments and gradually became
proficient.
   He's recorded nine No. 1 records, and two dozen made the Top 10
of the country music charts. He and Bobby Goldsboro were duet
partners at one time.
   In the late 1960s, Reeves had his own syndicated TV show, ``The
Del Reeves Country Carnival.'' He's just signed to be host of a new
60-minute syndicated TV show, ``I Am Country Music,'' to be taped
in Nashville.
   He's also appeared in eight movies including ``Sam Whiskey,''
starring Angie Dickinson, Burt Reynolds and Clint Walker.
   ``I loved doing movies,'' he said. ``All you did was sit around
and wait. We'd pair off and get guitars and write songs.''

<HEAD>Modern Battleground Revealing Evidence Of Biblical Conflicts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   AFIQ, Israeli-Annexed Golan Heights (AP) _ With the thud of
modern artillery in the background, archeologists are uncovering
evidence that the Golan Heights was as fierce a battleground in
biblical times as it is today.
   ``The battles between the Arameans (of ancient Syria) and
Israelis were governed by the same geopolitical considerations as
today: Whoever holds the high ground has a strategic advantage,''
said archeologist Moshe Kohavi, head of a Tel Aviv University
expedition excavating four sites in the Golan Heights with the help
of American, Japanese, Finnish and Israeli volunteers.
   The sites are the Leviah Enclosure, a wedge-shaped promontory
over the Sea of Galilee with gorges on three sides and high walls
on the fourth; Tel Hadar, where a large royal ``winter palace'' has
been unearthed on the eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee; Tel
Soreg, a hilltop town on the Ein Gev river; and Rogem Hiri, which
has been nicknamed the ``Stonehenge of the Golan.''
   Afiq, a kibbutz where the archeologists are based, preserves the
name of the biblical Aphek, the 9th century B.C. battleground where
the Israelite King Ahab's chariots and foot soldiers defeated the
army of Ben Haddad, the Aramean king, who had conquered much of
Israel after sweeping across the Golan.
   ``Ahab fought for the same advantage as we do,'' said Kohavi,
alluding to Israel's battles with Syria for the Golan in 1967 and
1973. Israel annexed the 42- by 15-mile territory with its 20,000
residents in 1981.
   Although ancient sites dot the map of the Golan, most are
unexplored. The Syrians put the area off limits as a military zone
and foreign expeditions have for the most part avoided it since
1967 because it is still disputed.
   ``There are more ancient sites than modern ones,'' said Matti
Zohar, a Hebrew University of Jerusalem archeologist working with
Kohavi's expedition.
   Evidence to support the Golan's historical status as a
battlefield comes mainly from the cities' construction, especially
the high walls.
   An iron arrowhead was found at Tel Hadar and a dog-shaped bronze
finial, the top of a standard, was found at Tel Soreg.
   ``Weapons and armor were precious because they were made of
metal,'' Kohavi said. ``It was very expensive and was not left
lying on the battlefield. What is found is usually discovered in
caches or in tombs but this is rare.''
   City walls, the main entrance, private houses and public
buildings at Leviah indicate it was a city spread over 20 acres
rather than a fort or large cattle pen as previously believed. The
emphasis on walls and natural defense gives insight into life
during the Bronze Age, 3,000-2,000 B.C.
   ``The people lived in large cities, probably war-like ones, and
they chose their sites for strategic reasons,'' Kohavi said of a
half-dozen similar sites in the Golan. ``There was apparently no
major power to pacify the area.''
   ``These were large fortified cities that probably fought each
other like the Greek city states,'' he said, standing on the
ancient city's stone gate and sweeping his hand toward three large
squares stretching across about 100 yards, where Israeli students
from the Technion University in Haifa were digging out rows of
stone that were the walls of ancient houses.
   Leviah was an exciting find, Kohavi said, because it ``proves
that the Golan was a thriving population center'' as early as the
4th century B.C. ``and not a fringe area as had been believed.''
The pottery and building style also indicated links with ancient
Lebanon.
   Only a few miles from Syria, the distant rumble of tank and
artillery could be heard as Israeli troops conducted maneuvers.
``We can't escape from what's going on in today's Golan,'' said
Kohavi.
   Throughout the Old Testament period the Golan Heights, a
volcanic plain 1,650 feet above the Sea of Galilee, was the focus
of a power struggle between the Kings of Israel and the Arameans
who were based near modern-day Damascus.
   Its importance was recognized by King David, who sought to
neutralize the power of the ruler of the Land of Geshur, as the
Golan was known, by marrying his daughter Maacah. Their son Absalom
later led a rebellion against David.
   Kohavi, seeking the first archeological evidence to confirm the
biblical stories, believes one seat of Geshur government may have
been Tel Hadar, which was in a no-man's land between Israeli and
Syrian armies before 1967, and sits on a rise surrounded with weeds
and barbed wire near a crowded summer resort.
   Archeologists have unearthed a large royal ``winter palace''
there on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. The palace, which
covered two acres next to what is now an amusement park, was
destroyed by fire at the end of the 11th century B.C. The most
visually striking aspect of the dig are granaries in the palace's
basement. An archaeologist bent and picked up pieces of burnt grain
more than 25 centuries old to show a reporter.
   A bulldozer helped remove large basalt stones from around the
entrance to the ancient palace. Among the finds were two delicately
carved legs to a basalt stoneware pot and a perfectly preserved
long-necked beer jug that was twisted and partially melted by the
intense blaze.
   At Tel Soreg, midway between the Sea of Galilee and Afiq,
volunteers sifted the remains of the settlement that was
continuously inhabitated for 2,000 years and is believed by some to
have been the biblical Aphek, a possibility Kohavi discounts
because it was too small to match the biblical descriptions.
   The Golan's battles even touched Tel Soreg, though it was out of
the path of armies marching across the plateau two miles away.
``When the Arameans and Israelites were fighting, the residents of
Tel Soreg built a high wall for defense,'' in the 9th and 8th
centuries B.C., he said.
   Zohar is trying to unravel the mystery of Rogem Hiri, which the
Druse Arabs have named the ``stone heap of the wild cat.''
   The four concentric circles of stone walls with a 6{-yard-high
mound of stones in the middle has been likened to Stonehenge, the
Neolithic stone circle in England. Like Stonehenge, it may have
been an astronomical observatory; the entrance marks the point of
sunrise on the longest day of the year.
   ``It has to be a burial site,'' said Zohar, standing on the
central heap of black volcanic stones. The cone-shaped core had
collapsed and the original structure resembled a stepped pyramid
like those found in ancient Egypt.
   Pottery found there this year dates the site to about 3000 B.C.

   Aspirin sales jumped 41 percent for a few weeks
earlier this year, not because of a rash of headaches.
   A study of more than 22,000 male doctors had shown that taking a
single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.
   The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the
first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _
but also to prevent them.
   In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tablet
and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours
can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.
   Without the treatment, patients had a 13 percent chance of dying
from a second heart attack within five weeks, the researchers
found. With the treatment, the figure dropped to 8 percent.
   ``The real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to
reduce in-hospital mortality substantially,'' says Richard Peto of
Oxford University, one of the study's authors.
   Heart disease is the nation's leading cause of death, by far.
The National Center for Health Statistics reports that 762,820
Americans died of heart disease in 1987.
   To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died that
year, more than one in three died of heart disease. (This does not
include those who died of blood-vessel diseases, such as strokes.)
   The drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing
heart attacks are the new clot-dissolvers and that old standby,
aspirin.
   The usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary
arteries, which supply the heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. The
blockage arises from the buildup of fats, cholesterol and clotted
blood.
   Clot-dissolvers break up clots, thus restoring blood flow.
Aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process, helping to
prevent clot formation in the first place.
   The limited sales of the clot-dissolving drugs in the United
States show that many doctors are still not using them, despite
their proven success. But that is beginning to change.
   Some doctors predict that in the not-too-distant future these
drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered
routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack
victims even reach the hospital.
   ``We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have
the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive
diagnosis,'' says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St.
Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.
   ``The most important thing we can do is teach patients in
advance about the value of early treatment,'' he says.
   While most public attention has focused on this new ability to
prevent heart attacks, researchers have also made important
progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart
attacks.
   Researchers at the University of Michigan recently determined
that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as
soon as three days after their heart attacks. Most heart attacks
victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to 10 days.
   The patients given early discharge were able to return to work
two weeks sooner than others in the study group. After six months,
not one death was recorded in the early-discharge group. The
researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks
victims could be safely discharged after three days.
   In July, Stanford University doctors found that workers who went
back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did
at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical
convalescence of about 10 or 11 weeks.
   All of these advances come at a time when public health experts
are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good
nutrition in lowering heart disease risk.
   Early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approval
will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol
and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.
   U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in July issued his first
report on nutrition, calling on Americans to lower their
consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables, fruits, fish,
poultry and whole grains.
   The report has been likened to the first Surgeon Generals report
on smoking, issued in 1964, which focused public attention on
smoking's hazards. Koop's recommendations largely echo those of the
American Heart Association, but they should help carry the message
to many more people.
   Progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the
heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without
warning and cannot be defended against.
   Much can be done to prevent heart attacks, great improvements
are being made in treatments, and recovery is faster than ever
before.
   The use of a clot-dissolver and aspirin could, alone, save
25,000 lives a year in the United States, doctors say.
   ``These results,'' says Dr. Peter Sleight of Oxford University,
``will change medical practice worldwide.''

   Heart attack patients often benefit from getting up and around
sooner, being released from the hospital earlier and exercising,
according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Even so, heart attack patients generally take 60 days to 90 days
to get back to work, and ``physicians' recommendations concerning
return to work are largely based on subjective judgments that have
changed little since 1973,'' the study said.
   The study, led by Dr. Charles Dennis of the Stanford Cardiac
Rehabilitation Program in Palo Alto, Calif., evaluated 201 men who
had suffered heart attacks without other medical problems. Subjects
were divided into two groups: those receiving usual care and those
receiving a special medical evaluation to determine fitness for
work.
   Evaluations were performed three weeks after the patient's heart
attack by a team of heart experts who administered a treadmill test
and used data on previous victims to estimate the risk each subject
would have of experiencing further heart trouble.
   The team then advised each patient's doctor of the findings so
the doctor could make a more informed recommendation on when the
patient could resume work.
   The study found that unless otherwise informed, doctors
generally estimated risk as much higher than it was and ``patients'
perceptions of risk mirrored those of their doctors.''
   For instance, doctors typically estimated patients in the study
had a 20 percent chance of suffering another fatal or non-fatal
heart attack within six months, while heart-team evaluations
typically found a 5 percent risk and the real risk turned out to be
3.5 percent, the researchers said.
   Patients in the usual-care group were told by their doctors they
could go back to work at 60 days and did so at a median of 75 days,
the study said.
   Patients in the special-evaluation group were told by their
doctors they could return at 48 days, and did so at a median of 51
days, representing a 32 percent reduction in the convalescent
period, the study said.
   ``This 32 percent reduction ... was associated with $2,102 of
additional earned salary'' per patient in the six months after the
heart attack, the researchers said.
   The study found no significant difference in the rate of
subsequent heart attacks or other heart trouble between the two
groups.
   Patients performing manual labor returned to work no later than
those performing sedentary jobs or light-physical labor, the
researchers said.

   High blood cholesterol, a prime factor in stroke and heart
attacks, may begin in childhood, according to a number of
nutritionists and pediatricians.
   They recommend that families in which parents or grandparents
have suffered from early heart attacks or strokes have their
children's cholesterol level tested at age 2 or soon after.
   For those with a high level of cholesterol, a low fat diet that
substitutes monounsaturated, polyunsaturated fats for saturated fat
sources should lower cholesterol levels. Some extra thought and
preplanning of diet can ease parental anxiety about the high fat,
high cholesterol snack food available.
   Some suggestions, from the Schneider Children's Hospital of Long
Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, N.Y.:
   _ Reserve ``special'' snacks to be consumed at ``special''
events, like birthday parties, or ballpark trips.
   _ Serve a low fat meal before or after the event.
   _ Bring picnic or snack food from home.
   _ Substitute pretzels for potato chips, a cola instead of a
milkshake, veal or chicken frankfurters instead of beef hot dogs,
air-popped popcorn without the oil.

   Americans say they exercise an average of 8.7
hours a week, but a majority believe they don't exercise enough,
according to results of a nationwide poll.
   The poll, conducted for Parents Magazine, also found that 47
percent of Americans are satisfied with their weight, 46 percent
said they are overweight and 6 percent said they are too thin.
   Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they don't exercise
enough; 43 percent said they do.
   The most popular exercise, reported by 64 percent of the people
who said they exercise, was walking rapidly. Forty-six percent said
they follow some exercise program of their own, 44 percent ride a
bicycle, 39 percent swim, and 32 percent play a sport.
   The magazine said its polling firm, Kane, Parsons & Associates,
surveyed 1,006 adults selected at random by telephone. The poll's
margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent.

   Only 6 percent of the adults surveyed in 32
states last year could recall what their cholesterol levels were,
reports the national Center for Disease Control.
   ``People don't know their numbers,'' says Dr. Patrick L.
Remington, a CDC cholesterol specialist. ``We've got a long way to
go to get people to know their numbers.''
   The federal government's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System regularly asks people about their health and behavior. Last
year, for the first time, interviewers asked randomly selected
adults in 32 states and the District of Columbia about their
cholesterol.
   Less than half the respondents, 47 percent, had ever had a
cholesterol check at all. Less than half of those people, or just
19 percent overall, said they had been told what their cholesterol
level was. And of those people, fewer than one-third, or only 6
percent overall, remembered what the level was.
   ``In the past, a doctor might do a cholesterol check during a
checkup, look at the reading, and tell the patient, `You're
fine,''' Remington said. ``What we're encouraging is for patients
to say, `I'd like to know what my number is.'
   ``And not only should you know your number, but you should know
what it means.''
   A cholesterol level of below 200 _ measured in milligrams per
deciliter of blood _ is considered ``desirable,'' according to the
CDC. More than 200 is considered ``borderline high,'' and over 240
is ``high.''
   Evidence about the links between cholesterol and heart disease
has grown in the past decade, the CDC noted in its report.
Government researchers believe a 25 percent reduction in
cholesterol can cut a person's risk of heart disease in half.
   Remington said cholesterol specialists want people to know their
exact numbers to avoid misconceptions. An old rule of thumb said
that anything under a figure of 200-plus-patient-age was OK, but
``that's obviously passe,'' he said, citing the current standards.
   In the 32 states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of
people knowing their cholesterol ranged from 1 percent in New
Mexico to a high of 9 percent in Maine, Maryland and Washington
state.
   The percentage of respondents who had ever had a cholesterol
check at all ranged from 29 percent in New Mexico to 57 percent in
Maryland.
   The margin of polling error for the surveys differed from state
to state and question to question, but ranged from 1 percent to 4
percent.

   Children who breakfast on ready-to-eat
cold cereals tend to be better nourished than those who breakfast
on other foods, according to a study of hundreds of 1- to
5-year-olds.
   University of Missouri nutritionist Gretchen Hill said her study
shows ``kids can get a good breakfast on their own by getting the
cereal box and some milk.''
   Hill, who presented her study during the annual meeting of the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Las
Vegas, said the research didn't suggest that cold cereal was the
only good breakfast.
   Parents who feed their children well-balanced breakfasts _
fruit, toast, low-fat milk, some bacon and only three eggs weekly _
shouldn't change, she said.
   ``But if you're lazy and have to choose between doughnuts and
cereal, provide the cereal,'' especially with low-fat milk, she
said. ``The data was very clear that there are a lot of nutrients
in that breakfast they might not get enough of in some other
breakfast.''
   Hill used data collected in l985 by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for her study of 27 dietary components _ including
calories, protein, vitamins, minerals and fiber _ consumed during
all three meals and snacks by 548 children ages 1 to 5 nationwide.
   Eleven skipped breakfast. Of the others, about half ate
ready-to-eat cereals. The half that didn't eat cereals wasn't
divided as to whether the children ate balanced breakfasts or not
because Hill simply wanted to know how the average cereal eater did
compared with other children.
   Cereal eaters tended to receive significantly more vitamins A
and B12, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, iron, folic acid
and zinc than non-cereal eaters or breakfast skippers, Hill said.
Cereal eaters also ate significantly less cholesterol and fat.
   She said all three groups tended to get adequate protein and
carbohydrate, but breakfast skippers risked low-energy and future
bone ailments because they failed to meet recommended daily amounts
of thiamine, calcium and vitamin A, and ate less fiber, pyridoxine,
calcium, magnesium, zinc and copper.
   Hill's study was financed by the Missouri Agricultural
Experiment Station, without support from cereal manufacturers, she
said.
   Liebman cautioned that a link between breakfast cereals and
better overall nutrition ``doesn't prove cause and effect. It's
possible these kids overall ate less fat and cholesterol because
they came from families that are more nutrition-conscious.''

   Two out of three Americans believe that health care costs are
increasing faster than improvements in the quality of care,
according to a recent survey.
   Seventy-five percent of the respondents also said that hospitals
should be most accountable for holding down costs, more so than
doctors or the government.
   Sixty percent felt confident about the quality of care delivered
by physicians, while 83 percent expected doctors to take the
greatest responsibility for quality of care on a day-to-day basis.
   The nationwide survey, conducted by R.H. Bruskin Associates, was
sponsored by BOC Health Care, Montvale, N.J., a conglomerate in the
areas of critical care and home care. The survey involved 1,029
respondents, 18 years or older.

   Most people don't really know what the role of the school nurse
is, says a nursing educator, who believes finding out can be
helpful to students, parents and teachers alike.
   ``I think a lot of people don't have any idea what the role of
the school nurse is,'' says Ruth Young Seideman, a former school
nurse who now is an associated professor of nursing at the
University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City.
``It's not as obvious as that of a teacher.''
   School nurses, she says, don't spend their time waiting for a
chance to hand out a Band-Aid, but on health monitoring, counseling
and disseminating information.
   ``We do not distribute drugs except in rare cases with a
doctor's order,'' she says. ``So while we will do CPR
(cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) or distribute aspirin, actually
treating patients is the exception rather than the rule.''
   A major part of the job, she says, is to serve as a referral
source, ``a resource person, to put the parents and teachers in
touch with health care providers.''
   The problems of a school nurse vary with the ages of the
students and the environment of the school district, she says.
   In elementary schools, the most common duties are identifying
communicable diseases, screen for health problems and coping with
playground accidents.
   In the high school setting, there are more delicate situations
of pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases and birth control, says
Seideman.
   Dental problems are there in all ages, she says.
   A constant project is teaching good nutrition and many school
nurses go into the classroom to provide information that they hope
will be passed along to parents. ``Connected with that,'' says
Seideman, ``the older girls often get preoccupied with their
weight, and then you need to be alert to symptoms of eating
disorders like anorexia and bulimia.''
   Not everything is a ``crisis,'' however. ``There are always a
few math-generated headaches,'' she says, ``when they come down
with the daily headache just in time for fourth-period math.''

   Feel like you're falling apart, going to pieces? Arms and legs
feel like jelly? Bothered by headaches, neck and back pains?
   These may be symptoms of anxiety, a fairly common and treatable
psychiatric disorder that in most extreme forms can be disabling,
says a Duke University Medical Center psychiatrist.
   Perhaps as many as 20 million Americans may suffer unknowingly
from anxiety, says William W.K. Zung, Duke professor of psychiatry.
Zung said a recent study found 20 percent of 739 consecutive
patients seen in a family medicine clinic had significant symptoms
of anxiety.
   ``The nine-month study was surprising because it suggested that
anxiety may be more prevalent in the general population than
previously believed, more common even than depression,'' he says.
``It's something that family practitioners should be on the lookout
for.''
   The study also found that symptoms of anxiety tended to increase
with age and seemed to affect more women than men.
   Duke University, in Durham, N.C., recently started an Anxiety
Disorders Program.
   Anxiety, he says, can disrupt sleep, upset the stomach; symptoms
may include shakes and aches, dizziness and sweating.
   A fear of flying or other phobias, panic attacks and
post-traumatic stress disorder are some of the forms anxiety takes,
says Zung.
   ``Generalized anxiety disorder involves fundamental biologic
changes that result from a patient's attempt to cope with and adapt
to stress,'' Zung says, stress that may be internal, external, or
both.
   Anxiety can be treated with medication, he says, as well as
psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and biofeedback.

   Despite greater awareness of exercise and healthy foods, many
Americans remain ``significantly overweight,'' according to federal
researchers who say most government nutritional goals are unlikely
to be met.
   ``Everybody knows what is required to lose weight, yet the
prevalence of overweight doesn't seem to change much,'' said Dr.
Marion Nestle of the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion in Washington.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, reviewed
the progress toward the government's 15 top-priority goals for
American nutrition in 1990, including raising public knowledge of
the effects of salt and lowering average blood-cholesterol levels.
   ``Substantial progress'' has been made in several areas, and
three of the goals will be fully met, researchers said.
   But despite the progress, Americans will probably fall short of
eight major goals, including that of getting people to lose weight,
said Ms. Nestle, whose office helped prepare the report.
   ``The research that relates (poor) diet to disease is now
incontrovertible,'' she said. ``It's really time now to start
looking at ways to implement the recommendations that everybody is
familiar with _ ways to improve the nutritional status of the
population.''
   The goals that will likely not be met, she said, are:
   _ Having less than 10 percent of American men and 17 percent of
American women over the ``significantly overweight'' level, defined
as more than 20 percent over desired weight.
   _ Having 50 percent of the overweight population on a
weight-loss program combining diet and exercise. The CDC said
recent surveys show half the nation's overweight people are indeed
trying to lose weight _ but only half are using both diet and
exercise.
   _ Cutting the average adult level of harmful serum cholesterol
below the 200 count. In a 1976-80 survey, average cholesterol
levels were 211 for women and 215 for men, down from 214 and 217 in
1971-74. ``That rate of decline is not as fast as it should be,''
Ms. Nestle said.
   _ Having at least three-fourths of all mothers breast-feeding
their babies at the time they leave the hospital. A 1984 survey put
the figure at 61 percent, up from 45 percent in 1978.
   _ Having all packaged foods labeled with ``useful calorie and
nutrient information.'' Such is the case in 55 percent of packaged
foods, up from 42 percent in 1978, Ms. Nestle said.
   _ Including nutrition education in the required school
curriculum in all states. By 1985, only 12 states had such a
requirement, the CDC said.
   The three objectives that researchers think will be fully met,
she said, are:
   _ Having more than 75 percent of the population aware of
nutritional risks for conditions such as heart disease and high
blood pressure (fats and salt) and tooth decay (between-meal
sweets). Awareness already runs as high as 90 percent in some
categories, the CDC report said.
   _ Having 90 percent of U.S. adults aware that to lose weight
they must eat fewer calories or increase physical activity, or
both. The percentage was 73 in 1985 and is rising quickly, Ms.
Nestle said.
   _ Implementation of a comprehensive national nutrition status
monitoring system. It is already in place, the CDC reported.

   Too many school lunches rate a ``C'' grade
because of their high fat content, a consumer nutrition group has
said, urging cafeterias to serve ``healthfully modified'' meals
such as chili atop baked potatoes instead of hot dogs.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said her group spotted encouraging trends toward
fresh fruit and vegetables in a survey of school menus.
   But she said the main courses served in school cafeterias ``far
too often are fried foods'' and other dishes high in saturated fat.
   ``Our young children are a captive audience. We have an
opportunity here,'' Haas said. ``We've got to establish lifestyles
that have healthy eating habits.''
   The $3.7 billion school lunch program, serving some 27 million
children, is run by the Agriculture Department. Surplus commodities
purchased by USDA account for 20 percent of the foods used in the
program.
   Therein lies the root of the problem, according to Public Voice,
because the commodities ``are often high in fat, sugar or sodium.''
   ``Congress has compounded the problem by bowing to the milk
producers' lobby and requiring that schools serve whole milk, with
low-fat milk optional,'' it said.
   Public Voice recommended, among other things, that USDA set
limits on the amount of fat, sodium and sugar permitted in school
lunches and distribute healthier commodities to schools.
   But Suzanne S. Harris, deputy assistant secretary of agriculture
for food and consumer services, said in a statement that ``it would
be irresponsible'' to let commodities purchased by the government,
as required by law, go unused.
   Furthermore, she said, ``the scientific community does not
support setting absolute levels for sugar, fat or sodium at this
time'' because current recommendations regarding children are
controversial.
   ``Nutrition strategies warranted for the general adult
population may actually be harmful to children, particularly
low-income children, during periods of growth and development,''
Harris said.
   However, Haas said the National Science Foundation, the National
Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association agree that
fat should not constitute more than 30 percent of a child's daily
caloric intake. And she said the average school lunch contains 39
percent fat.
   Public Voice listed several examples of traditional menus heavy
on fried chicken and fish, mashed and fried potatoes and sweet,
prepared deserts. The group compared those with ``healthfully
modified'' menus adopted by some school districts.
   For example, in Kennesaw, Ga., students got baked chicken
breasts with lemon and garlic, steamed broccoli and carrots, a
homemade whole wheat roll and fresh fruit. And in Denver, one meal
was a baked potato topped with chili, accompanied by raw broccoli
and carrots and sweet potato pie.
   ``We hear complaints that students won't eat this stuff,'' Haas
said. ``We just don't buy that.''
   Some school districts won praise for serving low-fat milk and
homemade low-fat salad dressings, buying the ingredients themselves
to substitute for higher-fat commodities from USDA.
   Haas urged the department to help keep nutritious meals
affordable by adapting the commodities program to more closely meet
USDA's own 1980 dietary guidelines. For example, she said, it could
offer schools whole potatoes and plain chicken rather than potato
rounds and breaded chicken ready for frying.

   A recent survey indicates that despite a lack of regular
exercise among the nation's youth, children do get involved in
physical fitness when it's fun.
   ``The survey confirms what we've known all along _ children will
participate in physical activities as long as they have fun,'' says
Jim Johnson, national director of Hershey's National Track and
Field Youth Program.
   The survey, of more than 6,000 participants in the Hershey Youth
Program, reported that nearly 80 percent got involved in fitness
and sports because they enjoyed gym class in school and nearly 78
percent feel a high level of enjoyment when they exercise or play
sports with friends.
   ``It's more fun to be fit together,'' says Dean Tice, executive
director of the National Recreation and Parks Association.
``Youngsters enjoy playing on a team or participating in group
activities because they develop a sense of camaraderie with their
peers, not because they win. That's why it's important to promote
youth fitness at the local levels through parks, schools and
recreation departments.''
   ``We're facing a youth fitness problem in America,'' says Ash
Hayes, executive director of the President's Council on Fitness and
Sports. ``Studies show that 50 percent of girls ages 6 to 17 and 30
percent of the boys can't run a mile in less than 10 minutes.''
   But, he says, ``kids definitely respond to fitness when it's fun
and satisfying. ... Our challenge is to get more kids motivated and
continue to encourage those youngsters who are active.''
   The survey was conducted by Datalab Inc. of New York on behalf
of the Hershey National Track and Field Youth Program. A random
sampling drawn from 21 states were polled at their state final
meets.
   The survey also found:
   _ More than 82 percent wanted to begin a healthy habit that
would last a lifetime.
   _ Less than half (44 percent) thought their involvement in
sports would help them improve their grades in school.
   _ A little more than half (51.4 percent) said they often
exercise with friends, while 31.2 percent said they are active in
team or league sports.
   _ More than 87 percent felt that gym class is ``lots of fun''
and they look forward to it.
   _ Jogging and running was the most popular sport of the girls,
followed by swimming. Basketball was the favorite of the boys,
followed by jogging and running.

   Some 20 million people in the United States suffer from a
hearing impairment, according to the Better Hearing Institute, a
trade group.
   Although hearing problems affect people of all ages, they are
most prevalent among adults over 65; one of every three people in
that group has a hearing impairment.
   But many people still fail to recognize their problem or deny
it. ``Denial is one of our biggest problems,'' says Robert Briskey,
staff audiologist at Beltone Electronics Corp., manufacturers of
hearing aids and diagnostic equipment.
   ``Usually family members get tired of hearing, `What did you
say?' They persuade the person to come in for testing. And the best
way to find out if you have a hearing loss that warrants assistance
is to simply get your hearing tested by a hearing health
professional,'' says Briskey.
   He notes some warning signs of hearing loss:
   _ People seem to mumble more frequently.
   _ You hear, but have trouble understanding.
   _ You find telephone conversation increasingly difficult.
   _ You no longer hear the ringing of a doorbell.
   _ You have been told that you speak too loudly.

   Exercise is especially important for asthmatics, according to a
Denver doctor, who says more than 11 million Americans suffer from
the lung disease.
   Asthmatics need regular aerobic exercise, ideally 30 to 40
minutes a day, three to four times a week, says Dr. Phillip
Corsello, director of adult patient education and rehabilitation at
the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine
in Denver.
   ``Many asthmatics experience wheezing following strenuous
activity, but that doesn't mean they must sit on the sidelines and
miss the physical and emotional benefits of sports and exercise,''
he says.
   He recommends swimming in a warm, indoor pool, and cautions
against exercising outside on cold, windy or smoggy days.

   There's a difference in the fat cells of men and women, which
may explain why men often have pot bellies while women often have
big hips and beefy thighs, according to recent research.
   Studies conducted at Rockefeller University in New York have
found differences between the sexes in both the makeup and number
of these cells.
   They show that, typically, women have more fat cells than men do
in their thighs, hips and bottoms. But the fat cells in men's
tummies are more likely than women's to accumulate fat.
   Learning how to tinker with the biological controls that rule
how fat cells take in and give up their cargo could open new ways
for making people slim and healthy.
   The latest research, conducted by Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, was
presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association.
   According to one estimate, 34 million American adults are
overweight, and a third of them are severely obese. Although too
much fat is unhealthy, studies have shown that where the flab rests
on the body is at least as important as how much excess poundage it
carries.
   In general, pot bellies are associated with a higher risk of
heart disease and diabetes. But extra weight down lower on the body
is not linked with these diseases.
   Experts believe this may be one reason why men have a higher
risk of heart attacks than women.
   Leibel said that women need to carry about 80,000 calories of
fat in order to get pregnant. This fuel is necessary to carry and
feed a baby. The most efficient place to store this energy is the
lower part of the body.
   Carrying extra fat in the abdomen is dangerous, he said, because
it interferes with the breakdown of insulin in the liver. This, in
turn, raises the blood pressure and causes diabetes.

   Whether it's Jane Fonda-like slim and trim, or hearty and hefty
for larger women, exercise tapes are chewing up a fat part of the
video market.
   A recent list of most popular videocassette sales in Billboard
magazine listed five such tapes in the top 20: ``Callanetics,''
``Start Up With Jane Fonda,'' ``Jane Fonda's Low Impact Aerobic
Workout,'' ``Jane Fonda's New Workout,'' and ``Kathy Smith's Body
Basics.''
   It was Jane Fonda who helped establish the ``how-to'' video in
1982 with her original ``Jane Fonda's Workout Tape.'' She was the
first major Hollywood star to do an original production for the
home video market; there have been nine Fonda tapes since then.
   Other actresses have gotten into the video exercise act, too.
Racquel Welch produced ``Racquel Total Beauty and Fitness'' and
Debbie Reynolds offers ``Do It Debbie's Way.''
   Recently, former Yakima, Wash., housewives Sharlyne Powell and
Sharon McConnell produced an exercise tape for large women.
   The $160,000 production was financed by the women and television
host Robb Weller, of ``Entertainment Tonight'' and the ``Home''
show. They are splitting the profits 50-50.
   The video, which sells for $29.95, is produced by Women At
Large, a chain of exercise studios begun in 1983 by the two
self-described bored housewives.
   The clubs cater to the 30 million women in the nation who wear
clothes size 16 or above. Instructors average 175 pounds, and the
goal is to build fitness and self-esteem, not lose pounds.
   The tape features the women's program of low-impact aerobics
that does not include the running, jumping and jogging they feel
can damage a heavier body.

   Business travel may be hazardous to your health.
   While 20 percent of all travelers suffer some illness while
abroad, according to figures from the national Centers for Disease
Control, business travelers are less likely to take proper
preventive measures than other travelers.
   ``As a group, business people are generally less prepared for
health-related issues when traveling than vacationers, students or
missionaries,'' says Dr. Kenneth R. Dardick, a University of
Connecticut clinical assistant professor of medicine.
   ``More often than not,'' he says, ``the business traveler is
preoccupied with the big meeting, seminar or interview than with
his or her actual destination, (while) a vacationer will
investigate the climate, the potential for contracting disease, and
other factors, and either decide to change their itinerary or to
take the necessary precautions.''
   He says the two most common areas of concern for business
travelers are environment-induced conditions, such as jet lag,
motion sickness and sunburn, and organism-related conditions, such
as malaria and rabies.
   To prevent jet lag, he advises patients not to drink alcohol,
smoke or overeat while traveling and, whenever possible, arrive at
their destination a day before their appointments to catch up on
sleep.
   For organism-related conditions, he advises business travelers
to check with their doctors before leaving on a trip _ and check
with them again upon returning.
   ``It's always best to catch these things early and to begin
treatment immediately,'' he says. ``Many conditions don't manifest
themselves until much later, and begin with a slight feeling of
discomfort.''
   Traveling need not be a debilitating experience for business
travelers, he says. ``Make the best of your trip _ don't let it get
the best of you,'' he says. ``You and your business will be better
off.''
   Another potential hazard for business travelers is lack of
exercise, whether on a plane or on the ground in a strange city.
   Nancy Burstein, author of ``The Executive Body,'' a fitness
book, and president of Fitness Plus, corporate fitness consultants,
has some advice:
   _ On long plane flights, get out of your seat once an hour and
walk the aisle.
   _ While in your seat, flex your feet and rotate your ankles.
Simulate walking by sitting up straight, lifting your knees
slightly and shifting your weight from leg to leg. Stretch your
arms above your head.
   _ Drink lots of water and avoid alcohol on the plane.
   _ Take advantage of hotel facilities for exercise, from weight
rooms and gyms to tennis courts and spas. Bring your bathing suit.
   _ Walk a few blocks from your hotel before hailing a taxi to
your meeting.

   Vacations can be a pain, literally, for arthritis sufferers, but
a Pennsylvania doctor says it doesn't have to be that way.
   In an issue of AIMplus, an arthritis information magazine, Dr.
Warren A. Katz, chief of the rheumatology division at the
Presbyterian-University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia,
offered some travel tips for people with arthritis:
   _ Plan your trip as far ahead as possible; avoid scheduling too
much sightseeing in one day; make sure you set aside several rest
periods each day. ``Pacing is crucial to a successful vacation,''
he says.
   _ On planes, trains or buses, try to do range-of-motion
exercises for your neck, hands, elbows, and feet. Get up and
stretch every hour.
   _ If prolonged standing is required, try to use a folding canvas
seat or a cane with an attached seat.
   _ Consider taking a cane on your trip, even if you don't
ordinarily use one.
   _ Wear comfortable and supportive shoes.
   _ Bring extra medication. Keep some with you in addition to that
in your suitcase.
   _ Keep a brief outline of your condition and the types of
medication you are taking in a pocket or purse. Also, ask your
doctor to provide the name of a reliable hospital or doctor in the
city you're visiting.
   _ Be prepared for all weather conditions.

   Children from rural areas are more anxious about hospital stays
than those from urban areas, according to a new University of
Alabama study, with black, male children from rural areas
apparently suffering the greatest degree of stress.
   The study also reported that all children when hospitalized show
some degree of stress, but preschool children (ages 3 to 6) are
most vulnerable.
   Anxiety ratings before hopital admission were not statistically
different for rural or urban children, according to researchers,
but were vastly different at discharge. The rate of children
showing ``worse than average'' adjustment to the hospital was three
times higher in the rural group, with 6.1 percent of urban children
``worse than average,'' but 20 percent of the rural group in that
category.
   All the children were exposed to experiences that would
familiarize them and their parents with hospital and medical
procedures. Also, they all took part in hospital playroom and
in-room experiences to help ease tensions. Yet, rural children
still exhibited more psychological upset than urban children.
   The study was conducted by Peggy Jessee, instructor in human
development and family life; Martha Strickland, assistant professor
and director of the Child Development Center; Carmen Hudson,
instructor in the Center; and Dr. James D. Leeper, associate
professor in the department of community medicine.
   The researchers studied children ages 4 to 17, 35 from rural
areas and an equal number from urban areas, who were hospitalized
for more than three days at Children's Hospital in Birmingham, Ala.

   If updating your first aid kit, the consumer health care
department of 3M suggests this checklist:
   _ Wound cleanser. Anesthetic cleansing pads for removing dirt
and numbing pain.
   _ Cold pack. For many, these ``instant'' packs have replaced the
ice pack. For cold therapy, just squeeze the pack and shake to
activate its cold-producing properties.
   _ Wound dressings. Gauze pads or the newer non-stick pads; both
are sterile.
   _ First aid tape. Pre-cut tape strips for holding pads on a
wound. Consider hand paper tape for sensitive areas, plastic tape
for hard to bandage areas, and cloth tape for heaving bandaging.
Look for tapes that are hypoallergenci and hospital-tested.
   _ Support bandage. The modern version of the athletic wrap,
usually self-adhesive. Many can hold a cold pack or dressing in
place.
   _ Pain relievers and medications. Check expiration dates on
aspirins, ointments and other preparations. Those with known
medical conditions may want to keep a supply of prescribed
medication in the kit.

   Motion sickness affects millions of traveling Americans each
year, whether they're in planes, ships or cars.
   Some advice for reducing the chances of developing motion
sickness comes from Harold Silverman, a clinical pharmacologist and
author of several consumer health books:
   _ In an airplane, try to get a seat over the wings. On a ship,
try to stay on deck as close to the middle of the ship as possible
and don't focus on the motion of the waves. In a bus or car, try to
sit in the front and focus your gaze straight ahead.
   _ Avoid reading during the trip.
   _ Lie down or recline whenever possible.
   _ Maintain proper ventilation.
   _ Avoid heavy meals and alcohol.
   _ Take a motion sickness remedy half an hour before travel and
every 4 to 6 hours during travel.

   The percentage of elderly people confined to nursing homes is
remaining stable even though the raw numbers are rising because of
an aging population, according to ``Health United States 1987,'' a
report issued by the Department of Health and Human Services.
   There were 1.3 million nursing home residents at least 65 years
of age in 1985, up 200,000 from 1977 when the last nursing home
data were collected.
   Despite growing political attention to the issue of financing
long-term care for the elderly, the figures in the 207-page
``Health United States 1987'' report underscore that a tiny
minority of all elderly people actually wind up in nursing homes.
   The report notes that the 1985 nursing home population reflects
about 1 percent of Americans 65-74 years old being confined to
institutions and about 22 percent of those 85 years and older. It
said both percentages are essentially unchanged from the 1977
survey.

   A weekend home at the shore or in the mountains may be what's
causing a sharp rise in sneezing and itchy, watery eyes, according
to specialists at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.
   ``Weekend-house allergy afflicts people who have always had
allergies as well as adults who never had allergies and are
perplexed as to why they have developed them now,'' says Dr.
Charles Kimmelman, who heads the infirmary's nasal center.
   ``Many of these patients spend weekends at summer homes that are
closed up during the week. Because there is no ventilation, house
dust and mold, the most comon causes of allergic rhinitis,
accumulate to levels where they cause problems. In a
well-ventilated home, these same people have no problems.''
   The solution, he explains, lies in keeping the air in the house
circulating.
   ``A central air-control system that heats, humidifies, cools and
filters air is ideal,'' Kimmelman says.

   Dark red plumes atop the tall grain
amaranth sway in the breeze at one end of this unusual field, and
long ears of brilliant blue corn poke out of shucks near the other
end.
   Between them, tiny white flowers hide buckwheat for pancake
flour; tough green pods protect cotton for cloth; and towering
stems support giant yellow sunflowers for snacks and birdfeed.
   The Parkland College crops-of-the-world demonstration plot
offers students and visitors a chance to see as many as 80 plant
varieties each year.
   They range from common Central Illinois crops like soybeans to
popular Oriental crops like mung beans.
   ``Our goal is to demonstrate as many different crops from around
the world as we can,'' said Kyle Wittler, chairman of Parkland's
business and agri-industries department. ``We use it to teach our
students and to show people in the community what these plants look
like.''
   The unusual plots _ a pair of 300-foot beds with a couple of
rows of each crop _ were created 14 years ago when Parkland moved
to its permanent campus on the west edge of Champaign.
   There is corn, but it's nothing like Illinois' leading
commercial crop. Instead, there is corn for making brooms; corn for
popping; South American flint corn for milling; multicolored
ornamental corn for decorating; and an ancient strain of corn in
which the kernels grow in individual green pods on the ears.
   ``People just drop in and they are surprised by the number and
the variety of crops we have,'' said Wittler. ``The ones with a lot
of color really attract attention.''
   Its showy red flowers make the amaranth popular with some
gardeners in the United States, said Wittler, but in Central and
South America the plant is raised for small seed that can used in
livestock feed.
   Saflower, raised for its cooking oil, produces beautiful orange
and yellow blooms; flax, grown for linseed oil and fiber, is topped
with tiny bluish flowers; rape, also raised for cooking oil, is
covered with delicate yellow flowers.
   The plots also feature traditional Midwestern crops and
vegetables: wheat, oats, tomatoes, turnips and peppers. And, there
are varieties of forage: Kentucky bluegrass, red clover and fescue.
   Parkland obtains the seed to plant the unusual crops from
dealers across the country and from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture plant introduction stations. Some seed is harvested at
Parkland and replanted.
   Occasionally, a crop proves to be unsuitable for Central
Illinois: tobacco and rice have been dropped from the plots.
   ``I've tended to eliminate those we've had trouble getting to
grow here,'' said Wittler.
   But there are enough interesting plants to attract even
professionals in agriculture.
   ``It is amazing the interest,'' said Bob Ulbrich, director of
Parkland's land laboratory. ``Farmers come by and they're not
interested in our conventional crops; they want to see these
unusual ones.''

   South Korea's trade surplus with the
United States shrank 15.7 percent in the first seven months of the
year, the government reported Monday.
   For the seven-month period ending July 31, South Korea's trade
surplus fell to $4.66 billion from $5.53 billion in the same period
in 1987, the Korea Foreign Trade Association said.
   Government officials attributed the slowdown to Korea's
revaluation of the won currency against the U.S. dollar.
   In addition, South Korea also has been under pressure from the
United States to reduce its trade surplus and has faced stiffer
U.S. import sanctions, officials said.
   Korean merchandise exports to the United States between January
and July rose 10.8 percent to $11.39 billion from the same period
last year, while imports from America shot up 41.5 percent to $6.73
billion, the report said.
   Exports to the United States were led by electronics, which rose
17 percent in the first seven months of this year, followed by
textiles which rose 4 percent.
   In July alone, Korea's trade surplus with the United States fell
18.4 percent from the same period a year ago, to $765 million, the
association reported.
   Meanwhile, Korean exports to Japan have risen sharply helped by
a strong Japanese yen which makes Korean goods more competitive
there in terms of price.
   Korea's trade deficit with Japan in the January-July period
narrowed to $2.49 billion, down 30.7 percent from the same period
last year.
   Korean exports to Japan jumped 52.2 percent to $6.33 billion,
while imports from Japan increased 13.8 percent to $8.82 billion.
   Korea's monthly trade shortfall with Japan in July was listed at
$372 million, down 39 percent from a year ago. Korean exports to
Japan in July rose 49.8 percent to $961 million while imports from
Japan went up only 6.5 percent to $1.33 billion.
   Korea's reduced trade gaps with the United States and Japan
partly reflected this country's trade policy calling for the
correction of its trade imbalances with the them by shifting some
imports away from Japan to the United States.

   A two-seat, turbocharged coup built
by Italy's Maserati for Chrysler Corp. will be in showrooms in
California by the end of the year, spokesmen say.
   Charles Kouns, a spokesman for Maserati's parent company, De
Tomaso Industries Inc. of Red Bank, N.J., said last week that
production of the car would begin today and it would be in
showrooms by year's end.
   Chrysler spokesman John McCandless said the car will be marketed
first in California, where convertibles sell year-round.
   The new car, called the TC Coupe, was announced in 1986. It will
have a standard hard top, a 2.2-liter, four-cylinder turbocharged
engine and a price tag of about $30,000. Chrysler has agreed to
take delivery of 7,300 of the automobiles by July 30, 1990.
   Also last week, Chrysler and De Tomaso announced an agreement in
which Chrysler would be prevented from gaining a majority control
of Maserati. The No. 3 U.S. car maker now owns 15.6 percent of the
Italian automaker, and De Tomaso owns 51 percent.

   The stock market advanced broadly in very quiet
late-summer trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.31 points to

as the Labor Day holiday approaches next Monday.
   In the economic news, the center of attention during the week is
likely to be the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which isn't due out until Friday.
   Gainers among the blue chips this morning included American
Express, up } at 29; International Business Machines, up } at 113;
General Electric, up \ at 40, and RJR Nabisco, up ] at 52.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.58 to 147.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .67 at 294.54.
   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.58 to
2,017.43. That left the market's best-known index with a gain of
1.43 points for the week.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 725 up, 605 down and
601 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 89.24 million shares,
down from 127.64 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Reaches Tentative Agreement With Four Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four unions representing 14,000 workers at
Westinghouse Electric Corp. have agreed to tentative three-year
contracts.
   The unions reached the national agreements Sunday, just hours
before midnight when the current pact was to expire.
   Details of the pacts were not announced, pending notification of
the union membership. Ratification votes were expected to take
place over the next two weeks.
   ``We have arrived at an innovative pay and benefits package that
is uniquely tailored to the needs of Westinghouse and its
employees,'' said George Dorman, Westinghouse vice president of
human resources.
   Dorman said he was optimistic the rank-and-file membership would
ratify the pacts.
   The four unions negotiating the agreements are: the
International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine
and Furniture Workers, or the IUE, representing 3,000 workers; the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, or the IBEW,
representing 5,600 employees; the Federation of Westinghouse
Independent Salaried Unions, representing 5,400 workers; and the
United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, or the UE,
representing 130 workers.
   The unions represent about 5,075 employees in western
Pennsylvania and 9,000 workers throughout the country.
   About 31 other unions representing Westinghouse's remaining
11,000 employees negotiate independent agreements plant-by-plant,
said Westinghouse spokesman Jim Schmitt.
   General Electric Co., a Westinghouse competitor with labor
contracts that influence the industry, agreed in July with the IUE,
the IBEW and the UE on a three-year contract that raises the
average hourly wage of GE workers from $12.02 to $13.40.
   The average hourly wage at Westinghouse was about $12.50,
Schmitt said.

<HEAD>First Boston, Credit Suisse Discuss Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Boston Inc. confirmed Monday it is
discussing a possible buyout by its major shareholder, the Swiss
bank Credit Suisse, that would take the investment bank private.
   The companies' goal is to create ``a global investment banking
firm,'' First Boston said in a statement.
   Three months ago the companies, which together own the
London-based investmentbank Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., said
they were considering some form of restructuring.
   While no details of the possible buyout were announced, analysts
quoted in Monday editions of The Wall Street Journal speculated
that Credit Suisse could offer as much as $50 to $52 a share, or up
to $815.36 million.
   Roughly 40 percent of First Boston's 39.2 million outstanding
shares are publicly held. Credit Suisse controls about another 40
percent of First Boston's shares.
   If the buyout is completed, First Boston said Credit Suisse's
stake would continue at about 40 percent while employees of First
Boston and Credit Suisse would join a limited number of
institutional investors in controlling the rest.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, First Boston
shares rose 87{ cents to close at $43.50. The Journal said First
Boston felt pressed to issue some statement about the discussions
as the company's stock had been rising on rumors.
   First Boston noted that no firm agreement has been reached and
that any transaction would not be completed before December.

<HEAD>Japanese Corporate Earnings Hit Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large Japanese companies reported record high
earnings of 21.05 trillion Japanese yen, the equivalent of $156.8
billion, for the fiscal year ended in March, the National Tax
Administration Agency said.
   The earnings of the 4,605 firms were 16.3 percent higher than in
fiscal 1986, said the tax administration's report published Monday.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone moved up from fourth spot in
fiscal 1986 to lead corporate earnings with 511.2 billion yen ($3.8
billion), boosted by the rapid spread of telephone and facsimile
communications, the report said.
   Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage, edged out Toyota
Motor Corp. for second place with earnings of 478.5 billion yen
($3.56 billion) to Toyota's 427.6 billion yen ($3.18 billion).
   Toyota was No. 2 the previous fiscal year and Nomura was third.
   Tokyo Electric Power Co. fell from the top spot to fourth,
reporting earnings of 420.6 billion yen ($3.18 billion), according
to the tax administration's annual report.
   News reports said the power company's cut in power rates due to
lower crude oil prices and foreign exchange gains resulting from
the strong yen were behind the firm's profit loss.
   Financial firms filled out the rest of the top 10. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank reported earnings of 351.8 billion yen ($2.62 billion);
Sumitomo Bank, 347.8 billion yen ($2.59 billion); Fuji Bank, 294.1
billion yen ($2.19 billion); Mitsubishi Bank, 292.8 billion yen
($2.18 billion); Daiwa Securities, 286.4 billion yen ($2.13
billion); and Sanwa Bank, 252.5 billion yen ($1.88 billion).
   Banks and securities firms, led by booming investment and
historically low interest rates, snared 27 of the top 50 positions,
one more than in fiscal 1986, the report said.
   It said the 4,605 firms paid a record high 7.58 trillion yen
($56.48 billion) in taxes in fiscal 1987, up 14.2 percent from the
previous year.
   A duty officer at the tax office said no officials were
available to comment on the report Monday.

   The stock market put together a broad advance in
very quiet late-summer trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 15.46 points to
2,032.89 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in the overall tally

507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.89 million shares at
midmorning.
   Interest rates dropped a bit in the government bond market this
morning, giving stock prices a lift.
   But analysts were reluctant to read much into the market's
swings, given the slow pace of activity.
   Last Friday was the quietest session of the year at the Big
Board, and trading was expected to remain light through this week
as the Labor Day holiday approaches next Monday.
   In the economic news, the center of attention during the week is
likely to be the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which isn't due out until Friday.
   Gainers among the blue chips this morning included American
Express, up ~ at 29[; International Business Machines, up 1\ at

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. is lining up on
the side of American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Sun Microsystems
Inc. in a high-stakes competition over a critical piece of computer
software.
   Matsushita said Monday that a close U.S. business ally has
concluded a licensing agreement with AT&T and Sun to use their
Sparc computer architecture in a new engineering workstation.
   The Sparc design is tailored for use with AT&T's latest version
of Unix. Unix is a base layer of software that allows programs to
run on a variety of computer models.
   The version of Unix developed by AT&T with Sun has been
challenged by an industry group that says the popular software
should not be controlled by one company. That group includes such
powerhouses as International Business Machines Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Matsushita's decision to jump into the fast-growing workstation
market ends an effective 24-year absence from the field of
high-powered computers. Workstations are fast computers with strong
graphics capabilities that are typically used by scientists and
engineers.
   Matsushita said it plans to build the central processing unit
for the workstations designed by Solbourne Computer Inc. of
Longmont, Colo., and Solbourne would supply the rest of the
workstation's components and sell it under its own brand name in
the United States.
   Matsushita owns 52 percent of Solbourne, according to Mike
Kitadeya, a spokesman for Matsushita's U.S. subsidiary.
   Solbourne hopes to put a workstation on sale in the United
States early next year, Kitadeya said.
   Matsushita's decision to enter the fray over Unix, though
indirectly for the time being, on the side of Sparc could affect
the opinions of other Japanese electronics makers.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened substantially
lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade, apparently on fears that
a high number of delivery notices will be posted against the
September contracts.
   Wednesday is first notice day for September grain and soybean
contracts, meaning it is the first opportunity for sellers to
declare their intent to actually deliver commodities to those
holding ``buy'' or ``long'' positions.
   A high number of delivery notices would indicate the potential
exists for a large increase in supplies of grains and soybeans on
the open market.
   But few players enter the futures markets with the intention of
taking delivery of physical commodities. Many of those holding long
positions will be forced to liquidate their holdings to avoid
taking delivery.
   Weekend showers in the Midwestern croplands added to the bearish
sentiment, as did continuing slack export demand, traders said.
   ``We need an increase in demand and we're not getting it,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with the investment firm Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.86 a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 2\ cents lower with September at $2.75\ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with September at $2.52 a bushel;
soybeans were 5 cents to 7\ cents lower with September at $8.26 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .37 cent lower with October at
72.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27 cent lower
with September at 82 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .65 cent
lower with October at 40.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.30 cent to .87 cent lower with February at 53.95 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mostly higher on Friday while frozen
pork bellies were lower.

<TEXT>
   Commercial Credit Group Inc. has reached
a definitive agreement to acquire Primerica Corp. in a
cash-and-stock deal valued at about $1.7 billion, the companies
announced today.
   Under terms of an agreement approved by both companies' boards
of directors, shareholders would receive one share of Commercial
Credit common stock plus $7 in cash for each share of Primerica.
   Based on Commercial Credit's closing price of $25.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange Friday, the deal has an indicated value of
about $1.7 billion.
   The combined companies will operate under the Primerica name,
according to a statement.
   Primerica, a Greenwich, Conn.-based financial services and
direct-marketing company, is the parent of the languishing Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. investment firm.
   Commercial Credit, headquartered in Baltimore, is involved in
several facets of consumer credit including lending, property and
casualty insurance and credit cards.
   Commercial Credit's chairman, Sanford I. Weill, will serve as
chairman, chief executive officer and president of the combined
company. Primerica's chairman, chief executive and president,
Gerald Tsai Jr., will serve as a director and chairman of the
executive committee of the new company.
   Upon completion of the transaction, Tsai will become the largest
individual shareholder of the new company, the statement said.
   ``With the transaction, we are creating an exciting growth
opportunity for the shareholders and customers of both Commerical
Credit and Primerica,'' Weill said. ``The combined companies will
have all the components, including a strong financial base, to
build a powerful and dynamic financial service organization.''
   The companies plan to sell Fingerhut Corp., Primerica's largest
specialty retailing unit, and focus more closely on financial
services.
   Tsai called the merger a ``logical next step ... Having
successfully transformed Primerica from a manufacturing-based firm
into a major financial services company, we are poised for a
signficant move to a higher plateau.''
   Primerica originally was known as American Can Co., but Tsai
changed the name to reflect its transformation from a manufacturing
concern to a financial services company.
   The company, which got out of the can business last year, owns
insurance and direct marketing companies in addition to its
troubled Smith Barney brokerage and investment unit, which was
acquired last year for $750 million.
   Primerica attributed its overall flat second-quarter earnings to
the weak performance by Smith Barney, which suffered from lower
trading volume, underwriting and commission revenues in the wake of
the stock market crash last October.
   Faced with dwindling returns in its municipal bond department,
Smith Barney recently dismissed five top executives from its public
finance division. The firm has seen its ranking as an underwriter
of tax-exempt bonds slip from second place last year to fifth this
year.
   Tsai reportedly had been quietly looking to sell Smith Barney
for some time, but was unable to find a buyer interested in paying
near what he paid for it.
   Under Tsai's direction, Primerica embarked on a strategy of
simplifying its operations and strengthening its financial position.
   To that end, the company announced in April that it would sell
Musicland Group Inc., the nation's largest specialty retailer of
prerecorded music and video home entertainment products, and three
of its insurance subsidiaries in deals that would net about $700
million. Tsai said at the time that the proceeds from the sales
would be used to reduce debt.
   Based on assets, Primerica is much larger than Commercial Credit
_ it has $35 billion under management compared with the $4 billion
Commercial Credit reported in total assets at the end of June.
   In early trading today, Primerica's stock today fell 87{ cents
to $29.25 per share.
   The companies said the transaction, to be completed by year-end,
is subject to the approval of the shareholders of both companies
and other regulatory approvals.

   Pratt & Whitney announced today the
elimination of another 1,042 salaried jobs in the last of three
rounds of job reductions that will make it ``lean and mean'' in its
competition for commercial and military jet-engine contracts.
   Pratt & Whitney, a division of Hartford-based United
Technologies Inc., said the latest job cuts brings to about 2,650
the number eliminated through layoffs, attrition and termination of
personnel contracts.
   The cost-cutting measures are expected to save the company a
total of $300 million a year over the next three years, officials
said.
   ``There is sadness that fellow workers are leaving, but there's
also a resolve that now we're going to be lean and mean, so there's
some optimism,'' said Curtis Linke, vice president for
communications.
   The job reductions are intended to put Pratt & Whitney in a
better position to compete for commercial and military contracts
with General Electric Co. and Rolls Royce PLC.
   Pratt & Whitney was once the country's leading engine maker, but
has slipped to No. 2 behind GE.
   ``This permits us to sell at a more competitive price and have
additional funds available for new equipment, benefits, facilities
or whatever,'' Linke said.
   He said that in the latest round of job cuts, 526 employees were
batified by
both governments in May. On Sunday, the Soviet Union began
destroying the medium-range SS-20 missiles it had aimed at Western
Europe during the tense years early in the decade.

<HEAD>Tandy Says It Is Sticking With Korea Despite Labor Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tandy Corp. said Monday it has no plans to cut
back its operations in South Korea in spite of labor unrest,
including an episode last month in which six women employees were
beaten up by a group of men from a rival labor group.
   Three of the women who were beaten were taken to hospitals for
treatment, and the 16 men who were identified as participants in
the attack were immediately fired, Tandy spokesman Ed Juge said
Monday. He said the women were able to return to work quickly.
   Juge confirmed published reports that the company recently
transferred production of some items from South Korea to Taiwan,
but said it involved only about a dozen items out of 200 to 300 and
was designed only to help the company stay on production schedules.
He said it would not result in any layoffs.
   ``We think this will all blow over,'' said Juge, who is Tandy's
director of market planning.
   Robert McClure, president of the company's Tandy Electronics
unit, which oversees the Korean plant, has said the company would
only reassess its presence in Korea if there were no signs of
progress in the next few years, Juge said.
   The beating episode at Tandy's plant in Masan, South Korea, in
mid-July involved rival labor groups, not Tandy management, Juge
said. He said it was sparked by a previous incident that occurred
away from the Tandy plant in which several men who attempted to
invade a women-only labor meeting were beaten up by some male
bodyguards.
   The next day, apparently in retalation, a group of men beat up
the six women, Juge said. He said the episode was an outgrowth of
the overheated labor situation in Korea and ``had nothing to do
with Tandy.''

<HEAD>Mexico Sees Its Economic Future in the Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government, in a bid to ease its
overwhelming economic dependence on the United States, is looking
across the Pacific for closer commercial ties.
   ``Having a coastline of 7,000 kilometers (4,300 miles) on the
Pacific, we have to participate in this great market, in this great
development. We have long been interested in it,'' Deputy Trade
Secretary Luis Bravo Aguilera said in an interview.
   He acknowledged the success stories of Far Eastern economies
have influenced the development strategy of President Miguel de la
Madrid, who has pioneered efforts to liberalize Mexico's foreign
trade.
   ``We are looking to increase our markets. There has been an
important development in nations throughout the Pacific,'' Bravo
Aguilera said.
   The interest in the Far East comes at a time when de la Madrid
is systematically dismantling trade barriers. The government has
freed about 80 percent of Mexican imports from official permit
requirements, eliminated inflationary and protectionist official
prices for imports and substantially reduced import tariffs.
   Mexico already conducts about two-thirds of its trade with the
United States. Officials here fear that with the market opening,
that dependence could increase unless the government actively
strengthens its commercial ties elsewhere.
   The logical choice: the Pacific, particularly Japan and South
Korea. The government is actively encouraging more Japanese
investment in and trade with Mexico.
   Japan was Mexico's second-largest trading partner in 1987. But
at $3 billion, Japanese-Mexican trade last year was only a tenth of
that between Mexico and the United States, accounting for 10
percent of total Mexican trade flows.
   Japanese investment in Mexico also trails only that by U.S.
firms _ but totals only $170 million, or 6.9 percent of total
foreign investment in the country.
   ``We are looking to increase our markets and believe that
countries like Japan and Korea that have ample commercial trade
surpluses are those that can buy many Mexican products,'' Bravo
Aguilera said. The government hopes to double its exports to Japan
in the next two years.
   Reflecting his government's interest in the Far East, de la
Madrid visited Japan and China in 1986. In July, a group of Mexican
businessmen went to Japan to pitch investment opportunities in
Mexico.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno arrived Monday for a
four-day official visit to Mexico, highlighted by the 100th
anniversary of the signing of the Mexico-Japanese Friendship and
Trade Treaty.
   In April, the government created the Mexican Commission on the
Pacific Basin, an inter-departmental working group whose aim is to
foster economic ties with the region.
   The Japanese are studying what additional Mexican goods are
feasible for import, Bravo Aguilar said. Mexico currently sends
silver, salt, coffee, auto parts, chemicals and petrochemicals
products to the Asian nation.
   Mexico also hopes to join in 1989 the Pacific Economic
Coordination Conference, which regulates regional trade.
   Japanese firms also have taken advantage of Mexico's maquiladora
industry. Foreign producers ship product components duty-free to
Mexican plants for assembly, availing themselves of cheap labor
costs in the country _ the highest minimum wage in Mexico is
roughly $3.50 a day. The completed products are then shipped abroad
for sale.
   Producers pay export taxes only on the labor costs, or value
added, to the product.
   The maquiladora plants' proximity to the vast consumer market in
the United States is another selling point for Far Eastern
producers.
   The government created in 1986 fiscal incentives for foreign
investment in Mexican industrial projects. It also permits
investors to maintain dollar accounts for commercial transactions
within a 12-mile zone along the northern border and all of Baja
California.
   In an effort to attract the maquiladoras to the interior of the
country, the government has constructed a 125-mile ``corridor'' of
industrial parks linking Guadalajara with Colima and Manzanillo on
the Pacific.
   Big plans are in store to install the Pacific coastal
infrastructure that will be needed to handle increased trade with
Basin economies.
   A new highway linking the port of Manzanillo with points east
will soon be completed and, it is hoped, induce foreign firms to
take advantage of the port's deep-water capacity.
   The government plans to make Manzanillo a principal shipping
point for manufactures and other export commodities destined for
Far Eastern markets.
   Struggling with depressed global market prices for oil, the
government has tried to encourage non-oil exports to diversify its
foreign income sources and enable Mexico to continue regular
servicing of its $104 billion foreign debt.
   But oil remains the country's leading foreign exchange earner.
And the government plans to make it easier and cheaper for Far
Eastern nations to obtain it.
   The state-owned oil monopoly Pemex is upgrading its export
shipping facilities in the port of Lazaro Cardenas in Michoacan
state. By the end of the year, the company will open an oil
pipeline to the port of Salina Cruz in southern Oaxaca state
expressly tailored for crude exports to Japan, South Korea and
other Pacific Basin nations.

<HEAD>OPEC Secretary-General Begins Talks In Iran Over Production Limits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto as one name is correct</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto arrived in
Tehran Monday for crucial talks on cutting the cartel's output in a
bid to stabilize the world oil market and keep prices up.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is reported to
be producing about 20 million barrels of oil a day this month, some
3.5 million barrels a day over its overall production quota,
keeping prices weak.
   Subroto, Indonesia's former Energy Minister, flew in from Kuwait
on the sixth leg of a tour of oil-producing countries and was
welcomed by Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Subroto's talks will be vital to OPEC efforts to impose
production discipline among its 13-member nations, officials said.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Subroto as urging all OPEC
producers to adhere to their output quotas. The news agency said
Subroto declined comment on current OPEC production levels.
   Subroto was expected to ask the Iranians to agree to allow Iraq,
their enemy in the Persian Gulf war, a quota equal to Iran's 2.36
million barrels a day.
   Iraq, which began talks with Iran recently over ending the
8-year-old war, has refused to accept an OPEC quota of 1.5 million
barrels a day, about half its current estimated production.
   The Middle East Economic Survey, a respected oil industry
newsletter published in Nicosia, said OPEC's August output, about
3.5 million barrels a day over its overall production quota, was
keeping oil prices weak.
   OPEC's official price is $18 a barrel. But the weekly noted that
Britain's benchmark Brent crude was selling at around $15 a barrel,
with gulf crude selling around $1.50 a barrel below that.
   ``Even assuming, as may well be the case, that demand is running
at a substantially higher level than projected by most forecasts,
such a production volume is clearly too high for comfort on the
price front,'' the newsletter said.
   The main violator of OPEC's quota agreement has been the United
Arab Emirates. It has rejected its quota of 948,000 barrels a day
and is producing an estimated 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Iraq currently produces an estimated 3 million barrels a day.
That includes 300,000 barrels a day provided by Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, Iraq's allies in the gulf war, to help sustain its
war-battered economy.
   That earns Baghdad, Iraq's capital, around $12 billion a year.
   Hopes that Iraq might agree to a quota were raised last month
when Tehran unconditionally accepted a United Nations cease-fire
call. The truce took effect Aug.20.
   But both Iran and Iraq badly need to boost oil revenues to pay
for the massive task of reconstruction. Oil industry sources
believe they both may be tempted to produce as much as they can get
away with.
   Before the war broke out in September 1980, Iranian production
was around 4 million barrels a day and had reached a peak of 6
million barrels a day during the reign of the late Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi.
   Baghdad has an estimated $85 billion in debt because of the war
and badly needs to boost its oil revenues.
   Iran is in better financial shape, with estimated foreign
reserves of $5 billion still intact and debts of only a few billion
dollars.
   But its oil revenues have slumped in the last few years during a
fierce Iraqi campaign to throttle its oil exports.
   Tehran earned around $12.5 billion from oil in 1984, but last
year's revenues were estimated at $9 billion, Western oil sources
have said.
   Iran's deputy oil minister, Kazempour Ardebili, last week
indicated that Tehran rejects giving Iraq production parity under
OPEC's quota system.
   The Iranians have insisted that Iraq be forced to accept the
lower quota, arguing that Iran's 50 million population is three
times that of Iraq.
   The Kuwaiti News Agency Monday quoted unidentified oil sources
as saying that Subroto might suggest increasing Iran's quota to
around 2.5 million barrels a day in an effort to woo Tehran.
   Subroto was expected to go on to Baghdad, Iraq's capital,
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Banca Commerciale Ends Bid For Irving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA said Monday it
was withdrawing its friendly bid for takeover target Irving Bank
Corp. because of a regulatory hurdle erected by the Federal Reserve.
   The Italian bank had offered $84 a share for 51 percent of New
York-based Irving. In a rival bid, Bank of New York has offered $15
in cash and 1.575 of its own shares for each Irving share.
   Joseph A. Rice, Irving's chairman, said in a statement he would
recommend the board immediately undertake ``an intensive effort to
replace the BCI transaction with another that is superior'' to the
current Bank of New York bid.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving jumped $2.25 a
share to $69.50.
   Earlier this month, the Fed said the Italian government agency
that owns about 60 percent of Banca Commerciale would have to
supply financial information in connection with the bid. Some
banking industry observers questioned whether the agency, Instituto
per la Ricostruzione Industriale, would be willing to do so.
   Banca Commerciale said in a statement the ruling placed ``a new
and unpredictable impediment'' to its plan to acquire Irving.
Because the Fed considered IRI a ``company'' under the Bank Holding
Company Act, it would have had to disclose its interest in more
than 100 U.S. commercial and industrial institutions.
   IRI also might have been forced to divest some of those holdings
to comply with U.S. laws that bar cross ownership of banks and
industrial concerns.
   Disputing the ruling, the Italian bank said in a statement: ``As
a matter of Italian law, IRI is a government instrumentality and
not a company, and therefore, it would be inappropriate for it to
file with the Fed.''
   BCI said it notified Irving it was terminating its offer.
   ``BCI regrets that Irving and its shareholders will not be able
to participate in what both banks considered to be a mutually
beneficial transaction,'' the statement said.
   Rice said that while he ``deeply regrets'' BCI's withdrawal,
Irving understood the decision in light of the Fed ruling.
   A spokesman for the Bank of New York said the bank was ``pleased
that BCI has withdrawn its bid.'' The spokesman indicated Bank of
New York was planning to persue the offer it has on the table
although Irving has rejected each of its bids.
   Bank of New York and many private banking analysts have
maintained Bank of New York's hostile offer was superior to that of
Banca Commerciale largely because the New York bank already had
received conditional regulatory approval. That approval expires
Sept. 7.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a late, partial
recovery from a steep sell-off that occurred earlier in the session.
   Traders linked the early declines of as much as 24 cents a
bushel in the soybean market and 7 cents a bushel for corn futures
to fears that a high number of delivery notices would be posted
Wednesday against the September contracts.
   A high number of delivery notices on the first notice day would
indicate the potential for a large release of stored grains and
soybeans onto the open market.
   Slack export demand and private crop inspections in the Midwest
during the rainy weekend contributed to the selling pressure, said
Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations for Balfour Maclaine
Corp.
   ``I think a lot of people were surprised that to see that the
(soy)bean crop was a little bigger than they thought,'' he said.
   Prices eventually recovered due to end-of-the-month book
squaring, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with the investment firm
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $3.88 a bushel; corn was
1\ cents to 6 cents lower with September at $2.74{ a bushel; oats
were 4 cents to 5\ cents lower with September at $2.49{ a bushel;
soybeans were 6 cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at
$8.26 a bushel.

<BYLINE>Pratt & Whitney Announces More Job Eliminations
^By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another 1,042 white-collar jobs were
eliminated Monday at Pratt & Whitney as the giant jet-engine
contractor completed moves designed to make it a more solid
competitor for commercial and military contracts.
   Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies Inc., said
the latest job cuts bring to 2,650 the number eliminated through
layoffs, attrition and termination of personnel contracts.
   The cost-cutting measures are expected to save the company a
total of $300 million a year over the next three years and are
intended to put Pratt & Whitney in a better position to compete for
commercial and military contracts with General Electric Co. and
Rolls Royce PLC.
   Pratt & Whitney was once the country's leading engine maker, but
has slipped to No. 2 behind GE in recent years.
   David Franus of Forecast International Inc., a Newtown-based
market analysis firm for the aerospace industry, said the move
shows Pratt & Whitney is ``getting more physically fit.''
   ``This is going to make both companies' (P&W and GE) engines
more competitively priced with each other and could conceivably
result in lower prices to the U.S. taxpayer,'' Franus said. ``It
may keep cost escalation down to a bare minimum.''
   Curtis Linke, Pratt & Whitney's vice president for
communications, said in the latest round of job cuts, 526 employees
were being terminated effective Monday, 231 would be let go by the
end of 1989 and another 285 were to be eliminated through attrition.
   The savings to the company of the elimination of those 1,042
jobs will be an estimated $95 million, Linke said at a news
conference.
   Last month Pratt & Whitney announced it was trimming more than
1,000 white-collar jobs from its commercial engines division, and
earlier this month it announced the elimination of 599 jobs from
its government operations division.
   Pratt & Whitney's total U.S. employment was about 37,000 before
the job reductions and will be about 34,500 by the end of 1989,
Linke said. Five years ago, the company employed about 42,000
workers.
   Pratt & Whitney used retirement and severance incentives last
year to reduce its white-collar workforce by about 2,000.
   Once the world's dominant jet engine builder, P&W saw its share
of the commercial market drop from 100 percent in 1974 to about 40
percent in 1987. Similar declines occurred in Pratt & Whitney's
military business.
   General Electric's share of the commercial market grew during
the same period from nothing to 45 percent to 50 percent.
   Pratt & Whitney said it is rebounding, however, with orders this
year running double the rate of last year.
   Linke said General Electric now has about 40 percent of the
overall jet-engine market and Rolls Royce about 20 percent.

   The stock market gained ground Monday, but
trading was so light that most analysts saw little substance in the
advance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had bounced
around last week to post a net gain of 1.43 points, rose 24.00
points to 2,041.43.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
924 up, 494 down and 513 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board, at 99.28 million shares,
was the second slowest of the year, surpassing only last Friday's
figure of 89.24 million.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 120.11 million shares.
   Interest rates dropped a bit in the government bond market
Monday, giving stock prices a lift. But it was the plodding pace of
the session, rather than the price action, that dominated
conversations on Wall Street.
   When the market is ``thin'' as a result of a paucity of orders,
brokers noted, stock prices can be prone to swings that don't
reflect any significant shifts in buying demand or selling pressure.
   Trading is expected to remain light through this week as the
Labor Day holiday approaches next Monday.
   In the economic news, the center of attention during the week is
likely to be the government's monthly report on the employment
situation, which isn't due out until Friday.
   Stock-market bulls will be looking for the data to show a
slowing in employment growth, which would give the Federal Reserve
less reason to pursue its recent policy of tightening credit.
   Gainers among the blue chips Monday included American Express,
up ~ at 29[; International Business Machines, up 1[ at 113];

<HEAD>Management Group Bids to Take Jack in the Box Owner Private</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Management of Foodmaker Inc., owner of the Jack
in the Box and Chi-Chi's fast-food chains, announced an agreement
Monday to take the company private in a bid that values the company
at $237 million.
   Foodmaker said it reached a definitive agreement with a
management group backed by the investment bankers Gibbons, Green,
van Amerogen to buy the 70 percent of the company the group doesn't
already own for $19.125 a share.
   Any competing proposals will be considered by Dillon Read & Co.,
investment adviser to Foodmaker.
   The Foodmaker board has recommended that stockholders accept the
buyout offer.
   Jack W. Goodall, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
executives sought to buy the company because they believed its
stock price did not reflect the true value of Foodmaker.
   Foodmaker's stock price soared on the New York Stock Exchange
after the announcement Monday, closing at $18.87{ a share, up
$7.12{ from Friday's close.
   San Diego-based Foodmaker owns or franchises 940 Jack in the Box
fast-food restaurants in the West, mostly in California, Texas and
Arizona. In April, the company bought Chi-Chi's, a Louisville,
Ky.,-based chain of 200 Mexican-style restaurants in the Midwest
and Northeast.
   Gibbons, Green, which helped present management buy Jack in the
Box from Ralston Purina Co. in October 1985, holds 29 percent of
Foodmaker's 12.4 million outstanding shares.
   Foodmaker went public in February 1987.
   The tender offer, which opens Sept. 1 and remains in effect at
least until Oct. 17, seeks at least 76 percent of the shares not
held by the management group.
   It also requires consent from the holders of $300 million in
bonds. Wells Fargo Bank has committed to loans of $350 million, the
company said.

   Commercial Credit Group Inc.'s takeover of
Primerica Corp. marks a possible renaissance for Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co., the stodgy brokerage that Primerica bought last
year in what emerged as a costly mistake.
   Despite the vaunted television advertisements in which actor Leo
McKern intones that Smith Barney brokers ``make money the old
fashioned way _ they earn it,'' the firm became a big drag on
Primerica, primarily because of the stock market crash and a slump
in the municipal bond underwriting business.
   ``I think the old venerable will be rejuvenated,'' said Perrin
Long, a brokerage industry expert at Lipper Analytical Securities,
reacting to the news announced Monday. ``I think you'll find new
batteries put into the old car, high octane gasoline put into the
tank.''
   Under terms of the takeover agreement, Commercial Credit will
buy Primerica, a financial services and retailing concern formerly
known as American Can Co., for cash and stock valued at $1.65
billion. The combined firm is expected to retain the Primerica name.
   For Smith Barney's 6,800 employees and 105 offices worldwide,
the prospect of a financially committed parent means the end of
uncertainty caused by speculation that Primerica Chairman Gerald
Tsai Jr. had been seeking a buyer for the 115-year-old brokerage he
bought only 15 months ago for $750 million.
   Commercial Credit, a Baltimore-based consumer finance concern,
is run by Sanford I. Weill, well-known on Wall Street for his role
in founding what is now Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., one of the
biggest investment conglomerates in the country. Weill also appears
determined to make Commercial Credit a powerful force in
securities, investment banking and other financial services.
   ``I think there is a really excellent opportunity for Smith
Barney to grow and prosper even in difficult economic
environments,'' Weill told the Associated Press in a joint
interview with Tsai.
   ``I think the exciting thing about putting the two companies
together is we're really in a way following the Smith Barney
advertisements _ we're doing the merger in an old-fashioned way.''
   Tsai, who once envisioned building Primerica into a
financial-service supermarket with the help of the Smith Barney
acquisition, appeared ready and willing to relinquish day-to-day
control to Weill, though Tsai will remain a powerful force in the
background as chairman of the executive committee.
   ``Sandy in my book is the best man to run the brokerage business
and he's going to play an extremely important part in the future of
Smith Barney,'' Tsai said.
   He also denied his purchase of Smith Barney had been a blunder,
saying: ``I think if you look at all the newspaper clippings from
last year after we announced the acquisition, everyone says we
bought a very good company.''
   At that time, Tsai was credited with engineering a brilliant
move by acquiring one of the best-known Wall Street firms during a
roaring bull market that showed no sign of fatigue.
   The Smith Barney addition brought him a household name, a
well-placed retail brokerage network and a significant force in the
municipal bond underwriting business.
   Tsai later revealed that a half-dozen other major Wall Street
CEOs asked him how he got Smith Barney so cheaply and he replied,
``I said I thought I paid a fair price.''
   For Smith Barney, which like other securities firms has been
forced to sacrifice independence to ensure their future growth, the
acquisition by Primerica was a way to gain the extra capital needed
to compete in the brutally competitive securities business.
   In retrospect, the move appeared disastrously ill timed,
analysts have said. A few months later the stock market crashed and
Smith Barney lost heavily, compelling Primerica to cut the firm's
book value by about $43 million.
   Since then, the stock market's post-crash weakness has severely
hurt the commissions of Smith Barney's network of more than 2,200
account executives.
   Aggravating the firm's performance was a coincident slump in
municipal bond underwriting and an erosion in Smith Barney's share
of what was left. The decline forced the firm to fire five top
public-finance officials earlier this month in an effort to reduct
costs and underwriting losses.

   Chrysler Motors Corp. announced
Monday Lee H. Runk has resigned as president of Acustar, the No. 3
automaker's wholly owned parts subsidiary to become president of
Harvard Industries, a Chrysler supplier.
   The resignation of Runk, 48, is effective Friday.
   ``We'll still be working closely with Lee and I'm sure our
relationship will continue to benefit Chrysler and its customers,''
said Gerald Greenwald, chairman of Chrysler Corp.'s car-making arm.
   Runk's successor will be named during Chrysler's board of
directors meeting on Thursday.
   Runk, who will be based in Detroit, joined Chrysler in 1962 as a
management trainee and held a series of jobs before being named a
vice president in 1981. Chrysler created Acustar as a wholly owned
subsidiary last year and Runk was named to head it.

   Federal complaints charging mail fraud and
embezzlement were filed in U.S. District Court Monday against a
financial planner who vanished earlier this month with an estimated
$25 million in investors' funds, according to U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen.
   The complaints allege Henry Gherman, 52, had illegally
transferred clients' money to a Miami bank account since 1978 and
issued false statements indictating investments in money-market
funds and certificate of deposits, said a statement by Lehtinen and
FBI Special Agent William Wells.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said authorities did not know
Gherman's whereabouts. Gherman has telephoned his wife and her
attorney but did not indicate his location.
   A group of Gherman's former clients, which include many Miami
Beach doctors, has filed suit in Dade Circuit Court seeking return
of the money. Gherman sent hand-written notes of apology to his
clients before dropping out of sight.
   The federal complaint, citing five counts of embezzlement,
alleged Gherman violated the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 by obtaining authority from various professional
associations and pension plans to transfer funds to his company's
account at Commercebank in Miami.
   Gherman then used the funds in the Financial Investment and
Planning Inc. account for his own use, the complaint stated.
   The two counts of mail fraud stem from statements Gherman
allegedly sent to investors which falsely indicated the funds were
in money market accounts, certificate of deposits or invested at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   According to a statement from Lehtinen, Gherman faces 35 years
in prison and fines in excess of $1.5 million if convicted on all
counts.

   Production at three oil refineries was
suspended Monday following a pipeline explosion that killed 11
people and injured 14, according to an official of the state-owned
oil monopoly Pemex.
   The explosion early Sunday in the 300-mile line cut supplies toanajuato.
   Three shiploads of oil were headed for the refineries on Monday
and they were expected to resume operations after being resupplied,
said Abundio Juarez Mendez, deputy director of primary production
at Pemex, in remarks quoted by the government news agency Notimex.
   The 15-year-old pipeline was expected to be repaired by early
Tuesday morning, he said.
   Juarez Mendez said toxic gases from a leak on the pipeline
caused the deaths of three people, and several hours later a flame
caused an explosion that took eight lives. He did not give details.
   Between 18,000 and 20,000 barrels of crude were lost through the
leak before the explosion, he said.
   The cause of the explosion, 270 miles east of Mexico City in
Veracruz state, was under investigation, Pemex said.
   A statement from the oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos SA, said
dozens of campesinos who were evacuated from their homes after the
explosion would be allowed to return on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Agreement Reportedly Near on $750 Million Loan Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina will sign an agreement
with the World Bank this week for new loans totaling $750 million,
according to a published report Monday.
   ``This week, we expect to conclude the agreement with the World
Bank, and by the end of next week we will begin negotiations with
the International Monetary Fund,'' Central Bank President Jose Luis
Machinea was quoted as saying by the financial newspaper Ambito
Financiero.
   The loan package comprises $400 million to support reforms in
the banking sector, and $350 million to reorient trade policy,
including the lifting of restrictions on imports.
   Shamid Husein, the World Bank's vice president for Latin
America, has been in Buenos Aires for about three weeks,
negotiating the agreement. He was due to leave Tuesday, Machinea
said, by which time the new agreement should have been signed.
   Earlier this month, the United States granted Argentina a bridge
loan of $500 million in anticipation that new loans from the World
Bank and IMF would be granted.
   Argentina has applied for an additional $500 million from the
World Bank to upgrade its electrical generating system, the daily
newspaper La Nacion reported, citing unnamed sources at the
Treasury Ministry.
   Argentina owes $56 billion _ third-highest among developing
countries _ to foreign creditors.
   Repayment of principal to commercial banks was rescheduled and
deferred last year. But interest obligations alone _ about $4.6
billion this year _ have proved difficult to repay, and are a drag
on Argentina's deteriorating economy.
   To accompany revenue from export sales, Argentina would like to
borrow $1.2 billion from the IMF, and an estimated $1.5 billion
from commercial banks to help meet interest repayment obligations
for this year.
   Earlier this month, President Raul Alfonsin devalued the austral
by 11.4 percent against the U.S. dollar and implemented voluntary
price controls in an effort to curtail inflation that rose by 178
percent between Jan. 1 and July 31, and by more than 25 percent in
July alone.
