   Secretary of State George P. Shultz says a
shakeup in the Soviet hierarchy that swept President Andrei A.
Gromyko out of the Kremlin shows that General Secretary Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is intent on pursing his policy of reform.
   But Shultz was hesitant Friday to offer a deeper analysis of the
changes, which also displaced Anatoly F. Dobrynin, a former
ambassador to the United States.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev is a strong and determined person,'' Shultz said
at a news conference. ``He has a major reform program that he is
working on. And if there is any message from this, it is that he
intends to pursue that program.''
   Gromyko is retiring from the Politburo, while Dobrynin is
leaving his post as foreign policy adviser for the Communist Party.
Both played key roles in relations with the United States for at
least a quarter-century, and Shultz had kind words for them.
   He called Gromyko ``a strong figure'' and wished Dobrynin well.
   The shakeup also downgraded Yegor K. Ligachev from ideology
chief to supervision of agriculture.
   The Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, Gennady Gerasimov, said
``people are just retiring. If you want my comment, it's a change
of generation... The generation that is coming to power waited in
the wings maybe for too long.''
   Gromyko, who last held the largely ceremonial post of president,
was foreign minister and Dobrynin was the Soviet envoy to
Washington during the detente period of U.S.-Soviet reconciliation
in the 1970s.
   ``All these changes are restructuring,'' Gerasimov told
reporters here.
   Shultz recalled working with Gromyko in 1985 to reopen
U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations and on arrangements for the
summit meeting between President Reagan and Gorbachev in Geneva
that November.
   Shultz was reluctant to assess the developments in Moscow.
``It's a little hard and a little early to say what they mean,'' he
told reporters.
   But Shultz then added: ``Mr. Gorbachev is a very strong and
determined person. He has a major reform program that he is working
on. And if there is any message from this it is that he intends to
pursue that program.''
   For the last three years, Shultz has been working closely with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. They have held 30 meetings
since Shevardnadze succeeded Gromyko in the post.
   ``I have never had any question in my mind that Mr. Gorbachev
and Mr. Shevardnadze are in control of their foreign policy,'' said
Shultz.
   From the start, Shultz said, Shevardnadze ``was a strong and
able individual. You could see that right away.''
   Phyllis Oakley, the State Department spokeswoman, said in
Washington: ``We will, of course, be studying those changes and
what they mean for the U.S.-Soviet relationship.''
   Reading from a statement, the U.S. official added: ``I would
like to point out that our policy toward the Soviet Union is based
on U.S. interests, not on personalities or who holds what position
in Moscow.
   ``We have in place a sound framework that can deal with the best
and worst in Soviet behavior. We naturally hope and expect that
U.S.-Soviet relations will continue developing in a constructive
direction, as they have in the last seven years. At this point, I
have no reason to doubt that those positive trends will continue.''
   Nonetheless, Mrs. Oakley had a word of criticism for Moscow. She
chided the Soviet leadership for having criticized United Nations
peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan on the very day, earlier this
week, that UN peacekeepers worldwide won the Nobel Peace Prize.

   Congress late Friday approved a $14.3
compromise foreign aid bill and sent it to President Reagan after
stripping out provisions that would have imposed punitive economic
sanctions against Iraq for its alleged use of poison gas against
the nation's Kurdish minority.
   The House dropped the Iraqi sanctions, which had been added to
the bill earlier by the Senate, without debate after they were
ruled out of order on procedural grounds. That sent the measure
back to the Senate, which acceded to the action moments later, just
one minute before the midnight deadline for passage of the bill.
   Opponents of the sanctions cited State Department fears that
such a move would damage diplomatic efforts to persuade the Iraqis
to forswear use of chemical weapons.
   Also dropped from the bill were provisions barring the sale to
China of three U.S. satellites to be launched on the Chinese Long
March missile until the president can certify that China is not
selling missiles to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya or Saudi Arabia and
will not do so in the future. The vote to kill that provision was
234-23.
   Opponents of that section of the bill argued that such a
prohibition would derail delicate diplomatic arrangements with
China worked out by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci on a recent
trip to Beijing.
   ``We can be reasonably confident that if we defeat this
amendment, and the sale of American satellites to Australia for
launch on Chinese rockets goes forward, they will not be selling
intermediate-range missiles to radical Arab countries in the Middle
East,'' said Rep. Steven Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee.
   In the same stroke, the House killed a Senate provision that
would have allowed for prosecution or expulsion of foreign
diplomats who are accused of serious and violent crimes in the
United States. House leaders said the provision would endanger
reciprocal agreements protecting U.S. diplomats around the world
and would tempt a presidential veto of the entire bill.
   The Senate and House earlier had passed different versions of
sanctions against Iraq, with the Senate approving a far more
sweeping version than the House.
   Earlier, the Senate shelved, 72-23, a bid by Sen. Howard H.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, to force the Overseas Private Investment Corp.,
OPIC, to end risk insurance to U.S. companies who set up industries
in foreign countries and export their products to the United States.
   Metzenbaum said OPIC's operations cost U.S. jobs by permitting
U.S. companies to produce their products more cheaply overseas.
   The Senate also voted, 57-32, to block a bid by Sen.. Steven
Symms, R-Idaho, to provide the World Bank with $50 million a year
for the next six years to help finance its operations.
   The overall foreign aid spending legislation shifts the emphasis
to grants rather than loans for U.S. military assistance to foreign
countries.
   Over the past few weeks, House and Senate negotiators drew up a
program for overseas arms sales that will provide $3.8 billion in
outright grants and $410 million in loans made on favorable terms.
   The agreement also retained the current military assistance
program with grants in fiscal year 1989 totaling $467 million.
   As in the past, the largest recipients for military and economic
aid were Israel and Egypt, which receive substantial support
because of their 1979 peace treaty.
   Israel would receive $1.2 billion in economic aid and $1.8
billion in military assistance. Egypt would get $815 million in
economic aid and $1.2 billion in military aid. All of the military
aid for both countries would be in the form of grants.
   Consideration of the Foreign Aid bill lacked the controversy of
recent years, in part because of last year's agreement between the
Reagan administration and Congress that smoothed the way for the
year's money bills.
   It would be the first time in seven years that a separate
foreign aid bill has been approved. Usually it has been folded into
catchall spending bills as Congress rushed to adjourn.

   The landmark welfare overhaul bill awaiting
President Reagan's signature has been strongly cheered by most
lawmakers, denounced as unfair by a handful and compared to a coin
flip by one who wondered if it would work.
   ``It's strictly marginal, a coin flip,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn., shortly before the House's 347-53 vote Friday completing
congressional action on the Family Support Act.
   It's a five-year, $3.3 billion chance, but Frenzel declared it
``worth the investment.''
   The work-oriented welfare bill, the first fundamental overhaul
of the system since it was established in 1935, has engendered
great expectations among many.
   Its aim: transform the system from a long-term trap to a
short-term boost, a gateway to mainstream economic America for poor
parents ill-prepared for the workplace.
   Its major tool: a broad new program called Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills (JOBS) designed to equip young parents and long-term
recipients with the education, training and job experience they
need to become responsible for their own families.
   ``Honest, productive, creative work is the essential element for
helping people turn their lives around,'' said Rep. Hank Brown,
R-Colo., a chief architect of the measure. ``It is the greatest
gift we can provide for those who are less fortunate.''
   Reagan has expressed satisfaction with the bill, which sailed
through the Senate 96-1 on Thursday.
   Liberals complained that the bill, which contains work
requirements, is unfair to welfare recipients; conservatives
charged that it won't cut people off the rolls or save taxpayers
money.
   But their complaints were buried under an avalanche of
bipartisan support for the bill that was painstakingly developed
over two years of hearings and a summer of intensive negotiations.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, said the end product ``provides real help, not
promises.''
   The bill combines carrots and sticks, both for the states that
will have to organize broad job, training and education programs
and for the welfare parents who will have to participate.
   States will get the freedom and money to fashion their own JOBS
programs _ but they're also told to expand cash benefits to
two-parent unemployed families, a group only 27 states now serve.
   To the extent resources are available, able-bodied parents with
children over 3 must participate in JOBS. But they'll get help with
child care and transportation costs, and a 12-month extension of
child care and Medicaid to help ease them into the private
workforce. And those with younger children will only have to
participate part-time.
   Rostenkowski said 65,000 new families _ 285,000 people _ will
receive welfare and Medicaid benefits when the rest of the country
adds two-parent households to the rolls. He said up to 400,000
people a year would benefit from JOBS and up to 475,000 people
would continue working as a result of the child care and Medicaid
transition benefits.
   The most popular aspects of the bill are child-support
provisions aimed at snaring more money from non-custodial parents.
States would receive money to identify more fathers and to set up a
computerized tracking and monitoring system to enforce support
orders.
   Furthermore, states would have to automatically withhold child
support from the wages of non-custodial parents in welfare cases.
In 1994, the automatic withholding would be expanded to all child
support orders, not just those affecting welfare families.
   Among the most controversial provisions is one requiring an
adult in each two-parent welfare family to participate for 16 hours
a week in a state-organized work activity if a job search fails.
   Some House members expressed frustration with their colleagues
for abandoning an earlier version of welfare reform that cost twice
as much as the final compromise. It offered states incentives to
raise cash benefits, which are a fraction of the poverty standard
in some cases, and didn't contain the workfare requirement.
   ``There is no justice here. This bill should be shelved,'' said
Rep. Major Owens, D-N.Y.
   The welfare system, Aid to Families with Dependent Children,
established in 1935, serves 3.7 million families and costs the
federal government about $8.5 billion a year.

   Archaeologists sifting through tons of
discarded earth at a dig on the island of Crete have found more
fragments of a unique gold-and-ivory figurine acclaimed as a
masterpiece of Minoan sculpture.
   The ivory torso and arms of a young man were unearthed last
year. They had been partly burned in a fire that swept through a
prehistoric town at Palaikastro on the island's eastern coast
around 1,450 B.C.
   This summer, the excavators recovered more than 100 new
fragments including shreds of gold leaf from the figure's clothing,
two finely modeled ivory feet, an ivory ear, and _ surprising of
all _ a stone head that would have fitted the missing ivory face.
   ``It's the figure of a young god. It's the most important Minoan
sculpture ever found and we want to recover as much of it as we
possibly can,'' said Dr. Sandy MacGillivray, co-director of the
excavation, said in an interview Friday.
   The Minoan civilization was Europe's earliest high culture,
flourishing in the Bronze Age between 3,000 and 1,400 B.C.
   It was named for legendary King Minos, who kept a half-man,
half-bull monster known as the Minotaur in a labyrinth beneath his
palace at Knossos on Crete.
   MacGillivray, who teaches archaeology at Columbia University in
New York, said two excavators found the fragments in ``two months
of working a water sieve to sift through 4{ tons of earth'' from
the area where the statue was located.
   The figure originally stood 16 inches high and apparently
shattered when it fell into a courtyard from a shrine in the upper
story of a large building.
   It probably was crafted around 1,500 B.C. in a period that
produced some of the best Minoan art, MacGillivray said.
   It portrayed a shaven-headed young man with a topknot, or
headdress, like an American Indian standing with arms clenched
across his bare chest.
   ``The stone head with its topknot was carved from gray
serpentine. ... We found it in three pieces and thought at first it
might be a helmet,'' said Hugh Sackett, of Groton School in
Connecticut, the dig's other co-director.
   He said two pieces of rock crystal ``each the size of a seed''
represented the whites of the eye, but that the stones used for the
iris hadn't been found.
   ``There's been a theory the Minoans used different materials in
the same piece of sculpture but this is the first example
discovered,'' Sackett said.
   The excavators said dowels on the feet could have fitted into
wooden legs that were destroyed in the fire. They speculate the
figure wore a gold kilt with a dagger stuck in the belt.
   ``It may be an early representation of the `beardless Zeus,' who
was worshipped on Crete later in ancient times,'' MacGillivray
said. Zeus was the king of the gods in Greek mythology and,
according to some accounts, was born on Crete.
   Finds from Cretan sites of delicately painted vases, carved
gemstones and miniature sculptures indicate the Minoans had a keen
eye for nature and the human form.
   ``The figurine is extremely naturalistic. There's evidence of
very accurate observation in the musculature and especially in the
rendering of veins and tendons,'' said Dr Jonathan Musgrave, who
teaches anatomy at Bristol University in England and has examined
the figurine on Crete.
   The restored figurine will go on display in Sitia Museum in east
Crete next year and the excavators said they will sift through the
same debris again in search of more fragments.
   ``It's tantalizing not to have the eyes, but we'll sieve all the
earth again next year so we might find them,'' MacGillivray said.
   The town at Palaikastro was destroyed by fire around 1,450 B.C.,
a time when disaster hit Minoan settlements all over Crete. The
destructions may have been caused by Mycenean invaders from
mainland Greece who then re-occupied some of the sites.
   ``We also found fragments of a Mycenean drinking cup this year,
the first indication that an east Crete site was resettled
immediately after the destruction,'' MacGillivray said.
   The Palaikastro dig is sponsored by the British School of
Archaeology at Athens and the New York-based Institute for Aegean
Prehistory.

   When thousands of Indians stood and sang
``Born in the USA,'' they weren't having an identify crisis.
   They were singing with Bruce Springsteen during an eight-hour
rock concert Friday night celebrating the 40th anniversary of the
United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
   It was the first live Western rock concert to be staged in India
in nearly eight years. The last group to appear was Boney M in 1980.
   The sell-out crowd of 55,000 fans, including Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi's two teen-age children, filled Nehru Stadium to
listen to Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, the
Epidemics and Youssou D'Nour and their appeals on behalf of Amesty
International, the London-based human rights organization.
   The concert was part of Amnesty's $23 million extravaganza
scheduled to travel to 20 countries on five continents. The tour
runs through Oct. 15, with the finale scheduled in Buenos Aires,
Argentina.
   Shortly after the show began, about 30 news photographers walked
out after a scuffle between a colleague and a security official.
   Sondeep Shankar, a photographer for the Times of India
newspaper, said he was assaulted when security men asked him to
leave the pit below the stage.
   A concert official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed
the photographer began violent and abusive.
   Few in the crowd were aware of the boycott.
   ``I came to see Springsteen,'' said Hitiesh Ahuja, an
18-year-old high school student whose ticket cost about $8 dollars.
``We can't believe he's really here.''
   Prior to Friday night's show, concert organizations complained
the Times of India, which sponsored the show, had been promoting
its 150th anniversary rather than human rights.
   ``We didn't come here to celebrate anybody's birthday bash,''
Springsteen told a news conference.
   Other performers were upset that some tickets cost as much as
$140, about half the average annual income in India.
   ``We are here to reach out to the common people of India and
raise their consciousness about the importance of human rights that
are violated all over the world, The show is not to raise money,''
Gabriel said.

   A woman whose 8-week-old son died of
starvation was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
   A Manistee County Circuit jury found Mildred Giddings guilty
Friday of starving her son, Raymond, in December 1986. Her husband,
Edward Giddings, will be tried on the same charges Oct. 25.
   Mrs. Giddings could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. No
sentencing date was set.
   Several physicians testified the child was born healthy, but
that he weighed 5 pounds, 11 ounces _ 8 ounces below his birth
weight _ when he was brought to West Shore Hospital in Manistee by
his parents on Dec. 12, 1986. He died later that day.
   Dr. Clyce Owings, a pediatrics specialist at C.S. Mott
Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor, testified it would take about a
week of complete deprivation to produce Raymond's state of
emaciation at death.
   The Giddings, who were living in a mobile home in nearby
Wellston, moved to Grand Rapids after their son's death, and were
arrested after a six-month investigation by state police.
   Sgt. Greg Summers testified that Mrs. Giddings told police she
was diluting the child's formula with water because she couldn't
afford to feed it to him at full strength.
   However, a couple who own a market where the Giddings shopped
testified Giddings told his wife to put baby food back on the
shelf, while buying meat, potato chips, soft drinks and other items
with food stamps.
   The couple have a 4-year-old son who reportedly is living with
his grandparents out of state.

   George Bush has struck again at
Democrat Michael Dukakis' home turf, a tactic aides say will
continue as the Republican campaign tries to keep the Massachusetts
governor on the defensive.
   In a campaign stop kept secret until just a few hours before,
Bush on Friday scooted to Springfield in central Massachusetts to
receive endorsements from local law enforcement groups. It was just
eight days after Bush blasted into Boston to get the nod from the
police union there.
   The endorsement ``comes from you who know the truth, not just
about me but about my opponent as well,'' Bush said, thanking the
local branch of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers
and the Springfield Police Department Supervisors Association.
   Officer Robert Jacobson, president of the IBPO local, said his
group decided to endorse Bush because of his support of the death
penalty and because of the prison furlough program that Dukakis had
supported.
   ``Our members have never supported furloughs for first-degree
murderers, but Michael Dukakis did,'' he said. ``Until public
opinion drove him to change his mind, they continued.''
   The program has since been altered to exclude first-degree
murderers.
   Ron Kaufman, the Northeast regional coordinator for the Bush
campaign, said the efforts to embarrass Dukakis on his home turf
would continue.
   Bush's first public events were in New Jersey, where he also
received the endorsement of local police groups.
   Bush was introduced in Paterson by Passaic County Sheriff Edwin
Englehardt, who chopped at the American Civil Liberties Union. It's
a group Bush frequently attacks and dares Dukakis to quit.
   The Paterson officers, he said, ``don't want a man in that White
House who is a sympathizer and a card-carrying member of the ACLU,
that great organization that's against everything that's right for
America.''
   Bush then repeated his blast of Dukakis as an ACLU member.
Dukakis supported the ``basic revolving-door program for
murderers'' while he, by contrast, wanted murders executed, Bush
said.
   ``My opponent had the nerve yesterday to come in here and talk
about oceans you can't swim in,'' Bush said. ``You tried to drink
the water in Boston Harbor recently? Don't do it.'' He was
referring to pollution, and not to the brine content of Boston
Harbor's sea water.
   From the Paterson municipal center, Bush went to nearby
Ridgefield Memorial High School, where he barely mentioned the
campaign in a soft-spoken appeal to the students to fight drug use.
   Bush then returned to the attack in Springfield, Mass., where he
also declared: ``I am running as myself, and my opponent is running
from himself.''
   He then paid a courtesy call on Archbishop John Whealon in
Hartford, Conn., and finished the trip with a rally in West
Hartford. Bush renewed the attack on an array of issues, including
crime and Dukakis' plan to crack down on tax cheats.
   It was wrong to hire ``three divisions of IRS agents'' to go
into ``every kitchen in America'' looking for people who haven't
paid their fair share of taxes, he said.
   In Washington, Bush spokesman Steve Hart disputed a statement by
former Central Intelligence Agency director Stansfield Turner that
Bush rehired Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega as a CIA
source in 1981.
   Turner told several news organizations that he had fired
Noriega, the head of Panama's military and de facto ruler of the
country, in 1976 because Noriega was an ``unscrupulous character.''
   The Dukakis campaign has made an issue of the Reagan
administration's dealings with Noriega up until his recent
indictment in the United States on drug charges.
   The vice president had no public events scheduled today or
Sunday. He planned to resume campaigning Monday with a trip to
California to watch the return of the space shuttle.

<HEAD>Pell Urges Moving Up Presidential Inauguration Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee says presidents should be sworn in earlier because the 2{
months between Election Day and Inauguration Day creates an
unnecessary ``period of vulnerability.''
   ``The incumbent president no longer has real political authority
and the incoming president lacks constitutional authority, and the
whole world knows it,'' Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said Friday.
``It is a period of vulnerability which can and should be
eliminated.''
   In a Senate floor speech introducing a resolution for a
constitutional amendment, Pell said the change would eliminate ``10
weeks of crippled leadership'' and avoid an ``unhealthy and
unnecessary situation.''
   The senator wants to move up Inauguration Day for the president
and vice president from Jan. 20 to Nov. 20. The constitutional
amendment also would move the swearing-in day for Congress from
Jan. 3 to Nov. 15.
   Pell has introduced similar measures in the past. With time
quickly running out in this session of Congress, action this year
appears unlikely.
   From 1793 to 1933, the swearing in of new presidents took place
March 4. The 20th Amendment pushed it back to Jan. 20 beginning in
1937.
   Pell, who introduced the resolution along with Sen. William V.
Roth Jr., R-Del., said the move also would avoid `@lame duck''
administrations in which officials might be ``tempted to expend
funds, make contracts and grants and promulgate regulations that
may be either politically motivated or inspired by sheer
self-interest.''
   Pell said the development of voting machines and instant
election result tabulations eliminates the justification for the
long lag time between elections and inaugurations.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen was off the campaign trail to prepare for his debate with
Republican counterpart Dan Quayle after returning to the nation's
capital to pick up an endorsement and criticize the GOP ticket.
   Bentsen, the Texas senator, was meeting today with advisers and
colleagues in advance of his Wednesday debate with Quayle in Omaha,
Neb.
   Among the senators advising Bentsen are Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and David Boren of Oklahoma,
Bentsen spokesman Michael McCurry said Friday.
   Bentsen aides and several advisers who helped Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis ready for his debate with
George Bush also were involved in the preparations. Rep. Dennis
Eckart of Ohio has been tapped to stand in as Quayle in practice
sessions.
   Bentsen spent several hours each day during a four-day trip this
week studying briefing books on likely debate topics and plans to
spend Sunday, Monday and Tuesday in Texas in final preparations. He
also is attending a fund-raiser Sunday for his Senate campaign.
Texas law allows him to run for both the vice presidency and
re-election to the Senate.
   The campaign trip, which ended in Washington on Friday with
Bentsen accepting the endorsement of the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket by
the 1.9 million-member National Education Association, offered
contradictory pictures from the Bentsen camp on the upcoming debate.
   Aides repeatedly told reporters Quayle was a proven debater
whose television skills are better than Bentsen's and whose
grilling in the news media has lowered expectations to the point
where it is extremely difficult for Bentsen to win.
   But, the expectations game aside, Bentsen repeatedly portrayed
the Indiana senator as a legislative lightweight, saying Quayle had
an ``empty resume,'' had opposed most of the progressive bills
passed by Congress this year and that he would pray for Bush's
health if the Republican ticket wins the election.
   He added Bush to that attack Friday, saying the vice president's
talk of balancing the federal budget and serving as the education
president is ``as empty as Dan Quayle's resume.''
   Bentsen told the NEA gathering he and Dukakis have lifelong
commitments to education and asked them to contrast that to
education program cuts sponsored by the Reagan administration.
   ``For advocates of public education, the choice is clear,'' the
senator told the teachers' union, which frequently interrupted his
brief speech with applause.
   Bentsen also delivered some tough talk on trade and defense
Friday, promising that if he and Dukakis are elected they will
demand access to the markets of all countries that have free access
to U.S. markets. Bentsen also said he and Dukakis would maintain a
powerful military and nuclear deterrent while calling on U.S.
allies to pay their fair share of ``defending the democracies.''
   Bentsen singled out Japan during that discussion, which took
place at a rally in Charlotte, N.C.. He said Japan pays far too
little of the burden of deploying troops and munitions and that it
should ``belly up'' and bear more of the burden.

   George Michael says he is satisfied with the
turn his career has taken since he went solo with his ``Faith''
album, and he doesn't mind being labeled a pop singer.
   Michael has reason to be satisfied: In the two years since the
breakup of his Wham! partnership with Andrew Ridgely, Michael has
had five No. 1 singles.
   ``Faith'' itself spawned four consecutive No. 1 singles,
including the title track from the solo album.
   In an interview published in Friday's Los Angeles Herald
Examiner, Michael said he has no problem being identified as a pop
singer, because he respects that end of the music spectrum. He
defended Wham!, a collaboration that resulted in 38 million in
record sales, as serious work.
   ``I don't think there was anything particularly lightweight
about `Careless Whisper' or `A Different Corner,''' he said. ``The
only thing that was lightweight was the way people perceived the
image.
   ``Mine is still very much a pop image. It's just that I believe
more in pop music than most artists do. And I don't think you could
call `Faith' anything other than a pop album. It's very diverse,
but I think it's just an accomplished pop album.''

   Author Alex Haley, standing on the dock
where his ancestor Kunta Kinte stepped ashore to be sold as a
slave, says a legacy of inadequate educational opportunities still
haunts American blacks.
   ``I couldn't be more moved coming back here, particularly to the
city, which is making this an annual thing,'' Haley told a crowd
gathered at the Annapolis City Dock to celebrate the second Kunta
Kinte High Heritage Day.
   Two centuries ago, Haley's great-great-great-great-grandfather
arrived after being captured by slave dealers in western Africa.
Haley commemorated his family's saga in the best-selling novel
``Roots.''
   After the program Thursday, Haley said blacks can use knowledge
of their heritage to build pride, but their history of enslavement
has another side that keeps many blacks from fulfilling their
potential.
   ``There are literally millions of black young people who are
inadequately prepared _ educationally, psychologically or
otherwise,'' he said. ``What we are seeing in this country is
paying the price for attitudes prior to now.''

   Singer Linzi Hateley, who won praise in the flop
Broadway musical ``Carrie,'' will make her West End debut Oct. 26
in the long-running London hit ``Les Miserables.''
   ``There is that bit of security, which obviously I lacked with
`Carrie,''' said Hateley, who starts rehearsals Monday for the
musical adaptation that begins its third year here in December.
   She is contracted for six months to play Eponine, the role that
resulted in a Tony award for its original star, Frances Ruffelle.
   Hateley, 17, who comes from the British Midlands, said it was
``nice to be doing something in your own place,'' particularly
after the vagaries of Broadway.
   Looking back on her time in New York, where ``Carrie'' closed
after five performances in May at a loss of $7 million, Hateley
said: ``It's a very, very strange town.''
   She played the title role of the telekinetic Carrie White in the
rock musical. ``Carrie'' was based on the Stephen King novel that
spawned the successful Brian de Palma movie in 1976.
   But Hateley said she had no regrets about doing the show, for
which she won personal raves on Broadway and in its British tryout.

   Jordan's motoring monarch proved he's also
king of the hill by topping 60 competitors in an annual automobile
race.
   King Hussein, 52, drove his Mercedes Benz 200 on Friday up the
1.8-mile Rumman Hillclimb course north of Amman in a record time of
2 minutes, 4 seconds to recapture a title he first won in 1956.
   Second place went to the king's eldest son, Prince Abdullah, who
finished in 2 minutes, 5 seconds.
   Abdullah won the event last year when it was revived after a
20-year hiatus following the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   The king is an avid pilot and was a successful go-cart racer and
rally car driver in his youth.

   John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, says her
husband dreamed about receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame, a dream that finally came true.
   ``I remember John and I walking in Hollywood, and John was
pointing out and reading all the names and wondering why he wasn't
there,'' she said Friday.
   As ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' played on speakers, hundreds of
fans gathered on Vine Street to pay homage to the former Beatle.
   The fans, mostly middle-aged, crowded against barricades in
front of the building housing Capitol Records, the Beatles'
original label, holding ``John Lennon Forever'' signs and bouquets
of roses.
   The star dedication coincided with the Oct. 7 release of the
David Wolper film documentary on the slain Beatle, titled
``Imagine: John Lennon.''
   Ono said she wasn't disturbed that the star was vandalized
earlier this week with paint and the scrawled words ``I buried
John'' because she was too excited about the movie, which focuses
on the couple's life.
   Lennon was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980.

<HEAD>Communist Party Says Fighting Inflation Is The Top Priority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party says China's top economic
priority for the next two years is to combat inflation, which shot
up about three-fold to more than 20 percent in the past year.
   Officials said Friday they will tighten credit, ban the resale
of raw materials and consumer goods and take other measures to
control a system plagued by hoarding, price-gouging and
profiteering.
   ``The next two years are the most critical period,'' the party's
policy-making Central Committee said Friday in a communique at the
end of a five-day closed meeting.
   ``Significant reform measures aimed at checking inflation should
be taken with urgency,'' said the communique quoted by the official
Xinhua News Agency.
   The committee called for reducing consumer demand and increasing
supplies of food, textiles, consumer products and raw materials in
order to hold down prices, Xinhua said.
   Vice Premier Yao Yilin, head of the State Planning Commission,
said the new policies received unanimous approval during the
Central Committee meeting, attended by 165 of the 175 members and
103 alternates.
   The simultaneous existence of controlled and free markets has
encouraged profiteering, with many factory officials obtaining raw
materials from the state at artificially low prices and then
selling them on the free market for huge profits.
   Inflation has soared from about 7 percent last year to more than
20 percent this year due in part to the failure of provincial and
local officials to comply with repeated orders to approve fewer
loans, cut back on spending and stamp out widespread speculation.
   Loose central bank control and overissuing of currency have also
contributed to the problem.
   Party leaders began signaling in August that a slowdown in price
reform was planned. Many economists consider price reform crucial
to China's decade-long effort to replace cumbersome central
planning mechanisms with more flexible market mechanisms.
   But government-ordered increases in food prices in May combined
with speculation-fueled increases on the free market triggered
widespread public discontent and waves of panic buying.
   Wang Deyan, president of the Bank of China, called for strict
controls on credit as part of the new inflation-fighting policy. He
said heads of branch banks should be punished if they disobeyed
guidelines set by Beijing, the official People's Daily said Friday.
   Wang said his bank will set rigid loan quotas for its branch
offices and no loans will be given for private or hotel
construction or to poorly-managed enterprises.
   He said these measures will ``give full play to the bank's role
in regulating the national economy,'' the paper said.
   In another report Friday, the Economic Daily said new
anti-profiteering measures banned the resale of raw materials
including petroleum, steel, aluminum, tin, rubber, and newsprint as
well as consumer items such as cars, motorcycles and televisions.
   The Industry and Commerce Administration and the Ministry of
Commerce earlier banned the local resale of 22 categories of raw
materials and consumer durables.
   The Central Committee meeting ended shortly before the
government's annual gala reception at the Great Hall of the People
to celebrate the Oct. 1 National Day holiday.
   Inside the Great Hall, bedecked with blinking neon lights,
Premier Li Peng and other top government leaders who usually brush
off reporters' questions commented at length on the economy. Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who headed the Central Committee
session, did not attend the event.
   In a speech before he toasted the 39th anniversary of the
Communist government, Li said: ``Orders must be obeyed. ... The
whole nation must reach a common understanding and act in unison.''
   Li also gave more economic bad news: Grain production will be
down this year, with the fourth disappointing harvest in a row. He
blamed heavy floods in some areas and prolonged drought in others.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Undertakes Informal Probe Of Wright Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee apparently has
begun an informal investigation into whether Speaker Jim Wright
violated rules against disclosing government secrets when he talked
openly last week about a purported CIA covert operation in
Nicaragua.
   On Friday, the ethics panel asked the House Intelligence
Committee to notify it whether Wright had been given access to
classified information from the spy agency on its activities in the
region.
   The senior Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois, said he was confident the panel would cooperate
with the request for information, even though it declined earlier
this week to send such information to ethics.
   The ethics committee's request came as GOP members of the
Intelligence Committee said they were prepared to ask the full
House to investigate Wright if action were not forthcoming soon.
   Democrats responded angrily to that announcement, charging that
the move was motivated by politics and by frustrations of Contra
supporters over the perilous state of the anti-government
Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``I think it's mean, I think it's ugly, and I think it's beneath
the dignity of the members of this House,'' said Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich.
   But the move by the ethics committee was a signal that the
Wright investigation was not being ignored, and Republicans seemed
satisfied _ at least for the moment.
   ``What was sought has been accomplished,'' Hyde said. ``I don't
see any point in airing this at this juncture.... We are not
interested in squeezing this for any political advantage. We want
it dealt with.''
   The controversy began Sept. 20, when Wright answered a
reporter's question by saying he had ``clear testimony from CIA
people'' that the agency had recruited agents in Nicaragua to stir
up demonstrations and civil unrest. Wright said the administration
hoped to provoke a crackdown by the leftist Sandinista government
and scuttle peace talks with the Contras.
   Wright later elaborated, saying the information was elicited
from the CIA under congressional questioning. But he subsequently
denied that he had relied on any such information in making his
comments, saying the agency's role in Central America was well
documented in published material. And he has said he feels morally
obligated to talk about any government action that is contrary to
its stated support for the region's peace process.
   The Republican resolution, which still could be brought before
the full House at any time, would require the ethics committee to
investigate the charges and direct other committees _ including
Intelligence _ to cooperate by providing relevant information to
the panel.
   But ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said his
panel's pace did not mean the matter had been shelved, and he
accused Republicans of being too impatient and eager to stir up
public controversy.
   ``I think all of this is hype, just to keep it going,'' Dixon
said, adding that he would not speed up his panel's process solely
to head off a floor debate that could embarrass Wright. ``I have
tried not to react to the political pressure,'' he said.
   Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., and the other Republicans acknowledged
that it would be difficult to pass the resolution in the
Democrat-controlled House but said they believed important
institutional principles were at stake, including cooperation with
the executive branch on intelligence matters. He denied any
partisan motive for the move.
   ``It is election time, obviously, but that hasn't got anything
to do with the reason we are here,'' he said.
   House rules prohibit any disclosure of classified information,
including CIA testimony before the Intelligence Committee.
Suspected violations are subject to investigation by the ethics
committee, which already is probing Wright's financial and other
dealings.

   Edita Gruberova won't make an operagoer forget
the excitement of Dame Joan Sutherland or the warmth and pathos of
Beverly Sills singing the title role in ``Lucia di Lammermoor.''
   But she did a fine job Friday night in her first appearance as
Lucia at the Metropolitan Opera.
   Miss Gruberova, who has a clear voice with super-high range,
floated some beautiful pianissimos. She sang all the embellishments
and added some of her own. Her approach was very careful, lessening
excitement a bit.
   Brian Schexnayder sang Lucia's brother. His lustrous baritone is
more an autumn voice than a winter voice. A heavier voice would
better convey the ``heavy'' who makes Lucia marry against her
wishes.
   Tenor Francisco Araiza sang Edgardo, whom Lucia loves. He has a
very attractive middle voice that constricts into a less pleasing
sound at the top of his range. Stanford Olsen sang the smaller part
of Arturo, whom Lucia marries and then stabs to death offstage.
Olsen was a happy surprise. Audiences don't usually hear such a
sweet, firm lyric tenor in this part.
   Edoardo Muller, conducting ``Lucia'' at the Met for the first
time, didn't always seem to be in synch with the chorus but gave
Miss Gruberova every consideration during Lucia's famous mad scene.
In keeping with current practice, she didn't race wildly about but
was gently mad.
   The Met added a scene that it hasn't had in a production of
``Lucia'' in more than 30 years. It's a brief scene right before
the mad scene in which Lucia's brother visits Edgardo to tell him
that she is married.

   Congress, racing against the clock, completed
work Friday on the last of 13 spending bills just three minutes
before the start of the new fiscal year, even as President Reagan
chided lawmakers for the ``dog-ate-my-homework era of congressional
budgetry.
   It was the first time since 1976 that Congress had passed all 13
separate spending bills.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the lawmakers'
accomplishment on the fiscal 1989 spending bills ``renewed faith
and confidence in this institution.''
   At 11:57 p.m., senators accepted by voice vote House language on
a $14.3 billion foreign aid measure, finishing a marathon day in
which Congress cleared five appropriations bills for fiscal 1989.
Two minutes later, a puffing House clerk ran into the Senate
chamber carrying the House legislation, technically sealing the
agreement reached by the vote minutes earlier.
   Fiscal 1988 ended at midnight.
   Reagan had planned to hold a late-night signing ceremony at the
White House for the final spending measures. But with Congress
still working, he canceled the ceremony and instead issued a
statement complaining about the ``dog-ate-my-homework era of
congressional budgetry.''
   White House spokesman Bill Harlow said Reagan would have no
comment on the final passage of all 13 bills until Saturday.
   Had Reagan signed the bills before midnight, it would have
marked the first time since 1948 that all 13 spending measures were
enacted before the start of the fiscal year.
   Since that time, the budget process has been marked by squabbles
that have resulted in some or all of the spending measures being
wrapped together. That practice rankles presidents because, as the
bills grow to cover more and more federal agencies, the political
consequences of a veto become more serious.
   Even though the fiscal year opened Saturday without the
president's signature on six of the bills, the effect will be
almost nil.
   Few federal employees work over the weekend. And even without
spending legislation in place, essential workers would report,
including the military, doctors, air traffic controllers and
others. But if all the spending bills are not enacted by Monday,
agencies for which money has not been provided would not be able to
keep their doors open.
   The House opened business Friday by approving a $282 billion
Defense Department spending measure on a 327-77 vote and sent it to
the Senate. The Senate later approved it, but added some provisions
which sent the bill back to the House, as both chambers must
approve identical bills. The House concurred with the changes.
   The Senate also voted 90-4 in favor of a House-approved $46.6
billion agriculture bill, and sent it to Reagan.
   All told, Reagan has signed seven fiscal 1989 appropriations
bills into law, most recently the $10.8 billion transportation bill
on Friday. The first was a $17.8 billion measure for energy and
water projects enacted on July 19.
   As the midnight deadline approached Friday, the Senate gave
final approval to a $3.2 billion District of Columbia
appropriations bill that carried a strong anti-abortion amendment
and gave Georgetown University the right to deny certain rights to
gay groups.
   D.C. Delegate Walter Fauntroy angered by the intrusion into
local affairs, said he would encourage city officials to disobey
the abortion-funding prohibition to trigger a congressionally
mandated shutdown of city government. Such a move would leave
Congress with the responsibility of governing the nation's capital.
   The federal government contributes $537 million to the D.C.
government.
   As the clock ticked on, legislation providing $1.8 billion for
Congress' own operating expenses received final approval. That left
the $14.3 billion foreign aid measure.
   The uncharacteristic rapidity with which the spending measures
were being completed this year is largely due to last November's
budget summit agreement between Reagan and congressional leaders.
That pact set the broad spending targets for 1989, and set a tone
in which administration and Capitol Hill officials consulted
frequently in an effort to resolve disputes.
   ``It shows what can happen when the president and Congress
cooperate,'' Byrd said.
   Last year's budget process produced nothing but partisan
brawling over spending levels and taxes. With neither the
administration nor Congress willing to budge, the beginning of
fiscal 1988 came and went without the passage of a single
appropriations bill.
   What emerged _ and not until late December, three months into
the fiscal year _ was a 1,400-page, $600 billion measure wrapping
all 13 spending bills into one.
   Reagan signed the measure. But in January, he promised on
national television to never again sign an omnibus spending bill,
and scores of lawmakers pledged to send the bills to the White
House one at a time.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
will offer new proposals to end a stalemate in peace talks between
Iran and Iraq, said Greece's foreign minister after he met with
officials from both countries.
   Foreign ministers Tariq Aziz of Iraq and Ali Akbar Velayati of
Iran gave no hint of progress, but both expressed cautious optimism
about the negotiations before today's face-to-face meeting.
   The two Persian Gulf neighbors and enemies are observing a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire in their 8-year-old war, which has caused
more than a million casualties.
   Perez de Cuellar and his special representative to the talks,
Swedish U.N. Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson, held separate meetings
Friday evening with Aziz and Velayati.
   All four arranged to meet today for the first round of direct
talks between Aziz and Velayati since the last round of
negotiations ended in Geneva Sept. 13.
   The meeting at the U.N. headquarters will be held under airtight
security.
   ``The building will be buttoned up,'' said a U.S. Secret Service
agent.
   The State Department has provided Velayati with a bullet-proof,
armor-plated blue Cadillac limosine, he said.
   Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulis met separately with
Velayati and Aziz on Friday and later said he discussed the war
with both men.
   ``Efforts have been undertaken on the part of the
secretary-general to resolve the deadlock that has evolved in that
area, and always there is hope that the deadlock will be
overcome,'' Papoulis said.
   Papoulias is the chairman of the Council of Foreign Ministers of
the 12 European Community nations.
   When the Geneva talks halted, Iraq demanded that the next step
must be that the Shatt-al-Arab waterway dividing the two nations be
cleared of sunken ships and silt so it is navigable again. It is
Iraq's only outlet to the Persian Gulf.
   Iran insisted that the remaining provisions of Security
Council's 1987 Resolution 598 be implemented before dealing with
other issues.
   The two belligerents have observed a truce since Aug. 20, the
first demand of Resolution 598, and five days later opened peace
talks, another provision.
   The remaining requirements are to withdraw their forces to the
border; exchange prisoners of war; continue peace talks to settle
their differences; and that an impartial commission be appointed to
apportion blame for the outbreak of the war.
   Aziz was asked on Friday en route to his meeting with Perez de
Cuellar wheter he was hopeful of a breakthrough and he said he was,
but did not elaborate.
   After the meeting, Aziz was asked if any breakthroughs were in
the offing, especially on the Shatt-al-Arab, and he answered:
   ``I don't want to make any hasty conclusions because we have not
yet met the Iranians and we will see if they have anything new,''
suggesting Baghdad is holding fast and looking for compromise on
Iran's part.
   Velayati told reporters when he emerged from his meeting with
Perez de Cuellar: ``We do hope that during these talks ... in New
York we could reach a tangible result, and we hope that we could
reach a concrete conclusion for the implementation of the other
provisions of Resolution 598.''
   His comments indicated Tehran has not altered its bargaining
position.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati, said ``We
should be hopeful. Diplomats must always be hopeful; we have no
other choice.''

<HEAD>Reagan Denies Government Holding Direct Hostage Talks With Iran</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

   President Reagan says the U.S. government is
``doing everything we can'' to gain the release of the hostages
held in Lebanon, but denied his administration is engaged in direct
negotiations with Iran.
   Reagan was queried about a published report in an Israeli
newspaper, which said a deal is in the works to release the
hostages, possibly as soon as Oct. 7.
   The president _ campaigning in Illinois on behalf of Vice
President George Bush _ told reporters, ``We have no direct
negotiations, or have we had, with Iran, at any time, in this.''
   ``Certainly there has been no contact between us and the
kidnappers,'' the president said.
   The American hostages are believed to be held by a pro-Iranian
group in Lebanon.
   An Israeli newspaper reported Friday that eight Americans and
one Briton held hostage in Lebanon will be freed in October as a
result of secret talks between the United States and Iran.
   The report said that in exchange for the release, Washington
will provide economic aid, gradually release billions of dollars in
Iranian funds frozen in U.S. banks and resume diplomatic relations
with Tehran, the English-language weekly The Nation said in a
report from Geneva.
   Lunching at a picnic table at a Polish social club known as
Wozniak's Casino, Reagan told reporters, ``We are doing everything
we can to get them back. But these rumors and reports are out about
negotiations. All I can say is, they must be coming from Iran,
because they're not true.''
   The Israeli newspaper had reported that a prospective
U.S.-Iranian deal would result in the release of five Americans,
possibly by Oct. 7, with a subsequent liberation of three remaining
Americans at a later point.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air
Force One en route to Chicago that ``there have been no deals as
outlined in these stories.''
   When asked if he was flatly denying that the United States was
conducting negotiations with the hostages, Fitzwater replied,
``That's right.''
   ``I don't deny that there are people talking to Iran about the
hostages, but no U.S. officials are talking to them,'' he said.
``There is no one authorized to make a deal for hostages or do
anything that is contrary to our policy.''
   The spokesman said that while there had been no direct contact
between officials of the U.S. government and officials of the
revolutionary government of the Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ``the
problem is we hear stories like this from sources all over the
Middle East.''
   ``There have been no face-to-face negotiations,'' Fitzwater
added, though he said, ``there have always been third-party
contacts.''
   ``There have been no talks that we directed or participated in
... the problem is, I cannot account for other people who may have
been talking to Iran,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the administration had no information about the
newspaper's report of an assassination attempt on Iranian
parliamentary speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, although he said, ``We've
seen those reports.''
   U.S. officials accompanying Reagan on the Midwest trip declined
to discuss the question of possible contacts with Iran through
intermediaries. The United States has often communicated with Iran
through third-party Swiss representatives in the years since
Khomeini's revolutionary government overthrew the Shah of Iran.
   The United States has said repeatedly that Iran must release the
hostages held by elements sympathetic to its cause. Administration
officials say the United States would be willing to talk to
authoritative Iranian government figures, but without preconditions.
   ``Our policy is still _ no deals,'' Fitzwater said.

   Britain said it is resuming full
diplomatic relations with Iran ``on the basis of reciprocity and
mutual respect.'' U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz quickly
made it clear that America was not about to follow suit.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe announced the move
Friday after meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akhbar
Velayati.
   The action accelerated an improvement in Western relations with
the fundamentalist government in Tehran of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeinei and Iran evidently wants to advance toward a more normal
position around the world.
   Shultz told a news conference that any U.S. settlement with Iran
required an end to the Iran-Iraq war, an end to terrorism and the
release of Americans believed held by pro-Iranian forces in Lebanon.
   ``There is no change in the situation as far as the United
States and Iran is concerned,'' he said.
   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Tehran last year after a
British envoy was beaten and kidnapped in apparent reprisal for the
arrest of an Iranian consul in Manchester, England, on shoplifting
charges. The diplomat was released 24 hours later.
   Britain and Iran did not break diplomatic relations, but ties
were badly strained and only the Iranian charge d'affaires was
allowed to stay in London.
   On Friday, Iranian charge d'affaires Mohammad Basti said in
London, ``Full diplomatic relations are to be restored and we hope
it will be at ambassadorial level.''
   Friends of John McCarthy, an organization campaigning for the
release of one of Britain's hostages believed held by pro-Iranian
guerrillas in Lenbanon, said in London that it welcomed Howe's
announcement and ``hopes that the fate of John McCarthy, Terry
Waite and Brian Keenan will be a top priority in the ongoing
discussions between Iran and Britain.''
   TV journalist McCarthy was kidnapped in Beirut on April 17, 1986.
   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut Jan. 20,
1987. No group has ever made a claim of responsibility in that
disappearance.
   Teacher Brian Keenan from Belfast in Northern Ireland, who has
dual British and Irish nationality, was seized in Lebanon on April
11, 1986.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has repeatedly
refused to enter into bargaining for the release of British
hostages.
   In another development, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Iran
denied a report Friday that said he tried to resign because foreign
policy decisions, including support for operations such as
hijackings, were made behind his back.
   Musavi said the British Broadcasting Corp. report could
adversely affect efforts to normalize relations with Britain,
according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored
in Cyprus.
   IRNA quoted Musavi as saying he tried to resign in August
because he dreaded a no-confidence vote against his new Cabinet in
Parliament. He withdrew the resignation after Khomeini sent him an
open letter calling it ``surprising.''
   The BBC reported that Musavi had said he was resigning because
his government was powerless and decisions were being taken that
had disastrous effects for Iran. The BBC cited confidential letters
between Musavi and President Ali Khamenei.
   The BBC said the documents were leaked to members of the Majlis,
or parliament, but it did not specify how they came out of Iran.
   The documents, made available to The Associated Press in Cyprus,
indicate deep divisions within the Iranian government.

<TEXT>
   Anatoly F. Dobrynin, Moscow's man in Washington
from the Cuban Missile Crisis to the reform era of Mikhail
Gorbachev, was known in diplomatic circles as an astute analyst of
U.S. affairs and a key foreign policy adviser.
   Dobrynin, 68, retired from his position as secretary of the
powerful Communist Party Central Committee on Friday in a major
reorganization of the top party apparatus that broadened
Gorbachev's base of support.
   Dobrynin's smoothness and ability earned him praise from former
U.S. ambassador to Moscow Malcolm Toon, who called him ``one of the
ablest diplomats of the 20th century.''
   Alexander N. Yakovlev, the Soviet ambassador to Canada during
some of Dobrynin's years in Washington and one of Gorbachev's
closest advisers, was assigned responsibility for international
policy in a streamlined Central Committee structure.
   No reason was given for Dobrynin's retirement from the job in
which he had a key voice on Soviet foreign policy decisions.
President Andrei A. Gromyko, who was Dobrynin's boss for many years
as Soviet foreign minister, also stepped down Friday from the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
   The tall and portly Dobrynin was recalled to Moscow in March
1986 after 24 years in Washington. During that time, he became
viewed as the dean of the diplomatic corps and gained respect as an
astute analyst of U.S. policies.
   Far less was known of his work in Moscow, where he was in the
public eye much less than in Washington. In one well-publicized
trip, he accompanied Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to
Afghanistan in January 1987 before the pro-Soviet government
announced a policy of ``national reconciliation'' with anti-Marxist
rebels.
   In the U.S. capital, Dobrynin personified the back-channel
diplomacy of sensitive, secret dealings between the superpowers.
   He was an unswerving defender of Soviet policies but won respect
of high-ranking U.S. officials for being able to get their point of
view across in the Kremlin.
   Although he appeared largely unchanged by living in the United
States for more than two decades, Dobrynin was fond of taking his
granddaughter to fast food restaurants on Saturdays.
   Dobrynin long had special access to the U.S. State Department,
and secretaries of state invited him in for drinks and private
chats.
   But during the first years of the Reagan administration,
then-Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig revoked Dobrynin's
privilege of using the department's garage entrance and private
elevator, a practice that had allowed Dobrynin to avoid the press.
   Dobrynin, who spoke fluent but heavily accented English, was
born Nov. 16, 1919, near Moscow. His father was a plumber.
   He was an aeronautical engineer during World War II and entered
diplomatic service afterward. He worked at the Foreign Ministry in
Moscow until 1952 when he was sent to Washington as a embassy
counselor.
   He returned to Moscow in 1960 to become chief of the Foreign
Ministry's U.S. and Latin American department. Two years later, he
returned to Washington as ambassador.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis stood behind his
record on environmental issues, telling California voters that as
Massachusetts governor his state outperformed the Reagan
administration in cleaning up toxic waste.
   Dukakis, stressing the environmental theme as he usually does
when campaigning in California, also said he would convene
``serious summits on the environment'' when dealing with the
Soviets.
   Dukakis flew to this key electoral state Friday and immediately
made a quick visit to the Stringfellow Acid Pits, one of the
nation's most notorious toxic waste sites.
   Then he held a town meeting in Riverside before flying north to
a series of fund-raising events in San Francisco and Sacramento.
The major event on today's schedule was a speech on ocean dumping
at an environmental rally.
   Most of the questions he received in Riverside concerned the
environment, including one about an issue George Bush has raised
effectively against Dukakis.
   The Bush campaign has been running television ads the past week
that show scenes of the pollution in Boston Harbor and that blame
Dukakis for not acting swiftly to clean it up.
   ``I consider the cleanup of Boston Harbor to be one of the finer
achievements of my administration,'' the Massachusetts governor
said. He said that under his leadership, ``the largest single water
cleanup project in America'' was under way to reduce the harbor
pollution.
   The multibillion-dollar project was being carried out with a
minimium of federal assistance, he said. Dukakis' opponents and
critics insist he was part of the problem because he delayed taking
decisive action much earlier.
   Dukakis said people in Riverside who have lived near
Stringfellow should know that his state was the first that passed
``and I'm the first governor who signed a state Superfund law'' to
provide funds to clean up toxic waste dumps.
   ``We've now cleaned up up almost 300 sites and we're working on
another 400,'' he said. ``The current administration has completed
about 25 or 30.''
   Dukakis also said that he discussed the environment Wednesday
when he met with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``Environmental pollution knows no boundaries,'' said the
Democratic nominee. ``We're not only going to have serious summits
on arms control, we're going to have serious summits on the
environment.''
   On the flight to California, State Assembly speaker Willie Brown
said ``the environment and drugs will probably be Mr. Dukakis'
strongest issues in California'' against Bush.
   Brown, who supported Jesse Jackson for the Democratic
presidential nomination, said his presence on the Dukakis plane was
evidence the party was united.
   In another part of the West, Dukakis won a newspaper endorsement
from The Seattle Times, which has endorsed only Republican
presidential candidates since 1920.
   The endorsement editorial that will appear in Sunday's editions
said Dukakis had shown ``a broader, deeper understanding of the
economies of the states and nation.''
   Dukakis' campaign on Friday also ran a new television ad during
a break in NBC-TV's Olympic coverage. The 30-second stop, called
``The Packaging of George Bush,'' consists of actors playing Bush
advisers who tell the candidate to ``wrap himself in the American
flag'' because he has no programs of benefit to middle-class
Americans.

<TEXT>
   A high-level advisory commission on deficit
reduction, after trying to keep out of the spotlight by holding
closed-door meetings, is going back to public hearings.
   The National Economic Commission announced Friday that it will
hold a public session next Wednesday, its first since mid-July.
   The announcement came after one commissioner objected to the
strategy of keeping the sessions secret until after the
presidential election.
   The 12-member panel, which was created by Congress to come up
with solutions to the huge federal budget deficits, held three
meetings in August and September purposely without a quorum to get
around open meeting requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee
Act.
   At those sessions, the commissioners heard testimony on such
politically sensitive topics as Social Security and possible new
sources of revenue to close the gap between spending and taxes.
   The panel, chaired by Democrat Robert Strauss and Republican
Drew Lewis, is working against a Dec. 21 deadline to make its
recommendations to a new president.
   In a speech earlier this week, commission member Dean Kleckner,
president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said the
commission was wrong to keep its deliberations out of the spotlight
to avoid becoming embroiled in the presidential election.
   ``Should the commission, over the very strong objections of
several of us, become a tax-hike vehicle, then the
revenue-versus-spending issue should be, must be, debated ahead of
Nov. 8,'' he said. ``The people who pay the bill ought to have a
chance to express themselves.''
   Commission spokesman James Hildreth said the commission's
decision to resume public hearings occurred because commissioners
were ``starting to get nervous that they might be technically in
violation (of the law) because too many people would show up.''
   He said that the last briefing session would have actually had
eight members present if airline flights of two commissioners had
not been delayed because of bad weather.
   ``There was just a general uneasiness that perhaps we had better
do something to make sure we didn't get involved in any diverting
controversy about violating laws,'' Hildreth said. ``We are not
trying to do anything illegal, secretive or anything else.''
   Then-Treasury Secretary James A. Baker had urged the commission
in March to keep its deliberations out of the public eye during the
presidential campaign. Baker had argued that the panel's findings
would carry more weight if they did not become embroiled in
election-year politics. Baker is now chairman of George Bush's
presidential campaign.
   The commission is composed of six Republicans and six Democrats
with two other members to be named by the president-elect after
Nov. 8.
   Hildreth said no decisions had been made at any of the meetings
so far and none will be made until after the president-elect
appoints his members.
   The Wednesday session will hear testimony on government benefit
programs other than Social Security and new priorities that the
government may be asked to fund in a new administration. Hildreth
said two other sessions on health care and defense are planned
before the election and they would also be open.

   Share prices slumped during the last trading day of
the week Saturday and shed all the gains made the previous day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed the
half-day session at 27,700.13 points, down a heavy 223.54 points or
0.80 percent. The index, a 223.54-point winner Friday, lost exactly
the same amount it gained the previous day.
   ``Share prices were lower mainly because it's Saturday when
trading usually slows down,'' said an analyst with Nomura
Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   He said Japan's economic outlook was quite good for investment
and added that the Nikkei's decline was not serious.
   Other dealers said the index dropped because investors were
inclined to sell stocks for profit after the gain Friday.
Otherwise, there was no negative economic factor in the market,
except for a lack of energy, they said.
   Due to the lack of specific direction, trading was rather thin
with volume on the first section totaling 550 million shares.
   The foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

   Farmers who grow corn and most other feed
grains in 1989 will have to idle only 10 percent of their base
acreage to qualify for price supports and other government benefits.
   This year farmers had to set aside 20 percent under the acreage
reduction program, or ARP, to qualify for benefits. But drought cut
yields sharply and siphoned off much of the nation's grain
stockpile. Thus, restrictions were eased on next year's plantings.
   Signup dates will be announced later, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng said Friday.
   Besides corn, the 10 percent ARP will apply to 1989 crops of
sorghum and barley. Oats will have a 5 percent idling requirement,
the same as in 1988.
   Lyng also announced some other provisions of the 1989 feed grain
program including:
   _Target prices for 1989 corn will be $2.84 per bushel, down from
$2.93 this year; sorghum, $2.70 per bushel, down from $2.78;
barley, $2.43 per bushel, down from $2.51; and oats, $1.50 per
bushel, down from $1.55.
   _Price support loan rates for corn will be $1.65 per bushel,
down from $1.77 this year; sorghum, $1.57 per bushel, down from
$1.68; barley, $1.34 per bushel, down from $1.44; oats, 85 cents
per bushel, down from 90 cents; and rye (which has no ARP or target
price), $1.40 per bushel, down from $1.50.
   _No marketing loan program will be implemented for feed grains
in 1989, unchanged from 1988.
   _Malting barley will not be exempt from acreage limitation
requirements established for the 1989 program.
   _There will be no paid land diversion, a feature that would pay
farmers for taking additional acres from production.
   In another report, the department said U.S. grain inventories as
of Sept. 1 included an estimated 4.26 billion bushels of corn from
previous years' harvests, down 13 percent from 4.88 billion bushels
a year earlier.
   Sorghum stocks were at 663 million bushels, down 11 percent from
743 million bushels a year earlier.
   Barley stocks were estimated at 441 million bushels, but there
was no comparison with a year earlier. No oats figures were
reported for Sept. 1.
   The Sept. 1 soybean inventory, at 302 million bushels, was down
31 percent from a year ago's 436 million bushels.
   Wheat stockpiles were reported at 2.24 billion bushels, down 25
percent from Sept. 1, 1987.

<TEXT>
   Discovery's launch may start a new
era for NASA, but the astronauts still face one problem that's
always bothered space travelers _ an uncomfortable comfort station.
   During the 32 months the shuttle was grounded after Challenger,
NASA made more than 200 changes aboard the craft, but improving the
space potty was not one of them. Astronauts still must contend with
an orbiting john that has been known to turn a simple call of
nature into a complex maneuver.
   When the shuttle toilet was first installed, it was said to be
the final solution to a problem that has bothered astronauts since
space travel began.
   Early astronauts learned that responding to a simple human need
in space required a lot more effort than back home. On Earth, there
is gravity and something deposited somewhere tends to stay there.
But in space there is no gravity and anything not tied down or
contained tends to float around.
   During the Gemini and Apollo programs, engineers designed
systems that used flowing air to collect liquid wastes. For solid
wastes, there were blue plastic bags that sealed after use.
Astronauts hated the bags. Some resisted using the bags so strongly
that they required medical attention upon return to Earth.
   For the shuttle, engineers designed a space toilet filled with
machinery and valves that promised the final solution for both
genders. The problem was to be solved with whirling blades,
freeze-drying and collection by vacuum.
   It was an almost immediate failure.
   The system was so complicated that it required some fundamental
toilet training on the ground. And once in space, astronauts found
that equipment designed to remain pristine and fresh often became
clogged and cranky. After some missions, the shuttle returned to
Earth smelling like an overused portable toilet.
   The system was modified time after time, but the complaints
continued.
   Searching for answers, Johnson Space Center officials held
closed door meetings with each returning astronaut, hoping that the
intrepid space fliers would recount personal anecdotes that would
solve the problem. But the terrors of the space toilet continued.
   Now an engineer at aerospace contractor Hamilton Standard Co. in
Windsor Locks, Conn., has proposed a system that officials hope
will silence complaints.
   Don W. Rethke, nicknamed ``Dr. Flush'' by his co-workers,
designed a toilet that he says is simple, sanitary and odor-free.
   Rethke said he originally designed the system for the space
station, the proposed orbiting laboratory where astronauts will
live for months.
   The Hamilton Standard design uses collection bags that are
mounted in a device that resembles the commode back home. The bags
are automatically sealed, compressed and stored in canisters. And
it's simple. Astronauts merely push a button and wait for the
machine to cycle. They then insert a new bag for the next user and
go on their way.
   Rethke said the space station system will collect and purify
liquid waste and even recycle it for hygienic use.
   NASA officials were so impressed with the concept they asked Dr.
Flush to submit a proposed design for the space shuttle. Other
aerospace contractors also may submit designs, but it was Rethke's
ideas that got the plan started.
   ``They (NASA engineers) are tired of trying to solve the old
problem,'' he said. ``This is a very simple system that may be the
solution.''
   America's astronaut corps hopes so.

   Federal savings and loan regulators have
wrapped up a six-week, $16 billion spending spree by pledging $2.5
billion to the rescue of six ailing thrifts in Texas.
   The acquiring companies have agreed to put up $153 million in
two separate deals and in return will acquire control of S&Ls with
assets worth $4.4 billion.
   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who has
been criticized by members of Congress for agreeing to ``thin
deals'' bringing little private money to S&L rescues, said, ``The
millions of dollars ... being invested ... proves again the Texas
thrift market is ... an excellent business opportunity.''
   However, a review of nine packages rescuing 42 Texas
institutions this year shows that regulators have committed $22
billion in aid, while bringing in capital of only about $300
million.
   In the biggest deal announced Friday, a joint venture headed by
Temple-Inland Inc. of Dibold, Texas, is getting $1.49 billion in
assistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to
acquire three institutions with combined assets of $3.19 billion.
   Temple-Inland, a forestry company, will get 80 percent of the
new institution's stock, while Trammel Crow Co., a Dallas-based
real estate development and management company, and Mason Best Co.,
a private merchant banking firm also based in Dallas, will get 10
percent each.
   Together, the three firms are investing $128 million.
   In the second transaction, Club Corporation International of
Dallas, one of the nation's largest operators of private dining and
country clubs, has received a commitment from the FSLIC worth
$999.5 million. For an investment of $25 million, Club is getting
control of three institutions with combined assets of $1.2 billion.
   In six weeks beginning Aug. 18, the FSLIC, which guarantees S&L
deposits up to $100,000, has committed more than $16 billion to
shut down or merge more than 60 institutions, including 32 in Texas
and 14 in Oklahoma, states hard hit by problems in the oil industry
and by lax S&L regulation.
   The recent spate of transactions represent about half the 124
S&L cases resolved by regulators so far this year.
   Wall, the nation's top S&L regulator, had announced he was
spending as much federal assistance as possible before the 1988
fiscal year ended Friday so that much of it would not count toward
the budget deficit. However, he conceded this week that he had been
mistaken and that there were only a few minor advantages to rushing.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the recent string of
transactions are a ``political shell game'' by Republicans intended
postpone any crisis until after the election.
   The bank board's spree has intensified debate over whether a
taxpayer bailout of the S&L insurance fund will be needed next
year. So far, the FSLIC has received all of its money through an
assessment on the industry.
   Congress' General Accounting Office has estimated it will cost
$45 billion to $50 billion to clean up the industry. Of 3,000
institutions nationwide, 500 are considered insolvent and another
400 close to insolvent.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, is estimating
that if the GAO pricetag proves correct, the federal budget deficit
over the next three years will be nearly $15 billion a year higher.
   The S&L crisis emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign
on Thursday when Democrat Michael S. Dukakis blamed the mess on the
deregulation policies of the Reagan administration. The campaign of
Republican George Bush, in turn, has attributed the problem to
foot-dragging by the Democratic Congress.
   The three institutions being acquired by Temple-Inland and its
partners are: Guaranty Federal Savings and Loan Association,
headquartered in Dallas with 33 branches; First Federal Savings and
Loan of Austin, with 22 branches, and Delta Savings of Texas, with
eight branches in and around Alvin, Texas.
   Among the reasons listed by the bank board for the failure of
the three are: high-risk lending to avoid recognizing losses,
conflicts of interest, unauthorized securities trading, speculative
commercial loans, poor underwriting practices and deficient real
estate appraisals.
   Club International, through a wholly owned subsidiary, First
Federal Financial Corp., is taking control of three Austin-based
S&Ls: CreditBanc Savings Association, Franklin Savings Association
and Great West Savings Bank.
   In two small deals in Indiana on Friday, the bank board provided
$16.7 million in assistance to rescue Citizens Federal Savings and
Loan Association of New Castle and United Savings Association of
Central Indiana, Tipton.

   Nicaraguan rebels accused the leftist
government of amassing troops and artillery for a major offensive
as another government extension to a six-month cease-fire went into
effect today.
   Radio Liberacion, the rebels' clandestine radio, also said
Friday the government provoked ``incidents with the Honduran army''
along Nicaragua's northern border.
   On Thursday, Nicaragua's Sandinista government announced its
fifth unilateral extension of the cease-fire that began March 23,
though peace talks stalled June 9. The ban on offensive operations
runs until Oct. 31.
   The U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, have said the truce is
indefinite. Their Radio Liberacion broadcast said the Sandinistas
were taking advantage of the cease-fire to prepare the offensive.
   After U.S. military aid to the Contras ended in February, the
bulk of the rebel force retreated to camps on Honduran territory
near the frontier. Both rebels and Sandinistas allege frequent
truce violations.
   Nicaragua's acting foreign minister, Javier Chamorro Mora, sent
a formal protest to Honduras Thursday in which he accused the
Honduran armed forces of six border incursions and three violations
of Nicaraguan airspace in September.
   A report Thursday in the official Sandinista newspaper Barricada
said Nicaraguan troops fired on the intruding aircraft in one
recent incident.
   Honduras denied the reports.

<HEAD>Fishermen Survive 32 Days Adrift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAURANGA, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two fishermen survived 32 days
adrift in a small boat by catching fish and drinking their blood,
they said today after being admitted to a hospital in New Zealand.
   Iaira Mauerere, 32, and Sera Toaea, 28, both Kiribati islanders,
were picked up by a South Korean refrigerated cargo ship on
September 21 after drifting 1,500 miles.
   They were transported to the New Zealand port of Tauranga after
being discovered by the cargo vessel Kohufu. They were expected to
be released from the hospital this afternoon. Neither was seriously
hurt.
   ``Fish was the only way we survived,'' Mauerere said from
Tauranga Hospital.
   The pair's ordeal began on August 20 when Mauerere, an assistant
fisheries officer for the Kiribati Governments Fisheries Division,
invited Toaea, a fisherman, to join him on a six-hour trip to
deliver three men to an island in the Kiribati group.
   They set off from Tarawa, the island capital, in a Fisheries
Division 28-foot fibreglass open boat with an outboard motor.
   On the return trip, the motor broke down.
   The men had only a basket of babai, a vegetable similar to a
potato, some coconuts and some drinking water.
   To protect themselves from the sun and cool winds at night, they
pulled up some of the interior boards in the base of the boat and
erected a shelter, tied together by trawler line.
   After nine days the food ran out. On the 18th day the water ran
out.
   During the ordeal they slept, fished and swam. They ate the fish
raw.
   Mauerere said they had dried fish on board but once their water
was used up they had to survive on raw fresh fish to keep up their
moisture intake.
   He said the duo recalled reading about others who had survived
at sea by sucking blood from the tails of fish.
   ``We were a bit scared about drinking this but thought, `Let's
try. This is the only way we have to survive,''' he said.
   Both men said they vomited, but managed to glean sufficient
moisture from the fish blood.
   ``We were lucky to be saved,'' Mauerere said. ``Sera was upset
because he thought we could have died. I said, `No, get rid of
those bad memories. We have to start a new life on this beautiful
boat.'''
   The men, both married, spent an additional eight days on the
South Korean vessel before sighting land.

<HEAD>Kabul Echoes Soviet Criticism Of Alleged Pakistani Violations Of
Afghan Pact</HEAD>

   Afghan officials have reiterated Soviet
claims that Pakistan is sheltering, training and arming Islamic
rebels who launch raids across the border into Afghanistan.
   The provision of ``modern weapons, including Stingers,
long-range artillery and mortars and ground-to-ground rockets to
the extremist opposition groups and their transfer to Afghanistan
is continuing,'' said Abdul Wakil, Kabul's foreign minister, on
Friday.
   The United States ``is still continuing the dispatch of weapons
and equipment to armed extremist groups,'' he continued, accusing
Pakistani militias of joining attacks in the Afghan regions of Spin
Boldak, Kandahar and the Kunars.
   Pakistan's ``centers of of training, arming and equiping of
armed extremist groups on its territory have not been dismantled,''
Wakil said in his speech to the 43rd General Assembly.
   He contended that ``Afghanistan has never resorted to small- or
large-scale border violations either from land or air and has
nothing to do with the internal incidents occurring in its
neighboring countries.''
   Pakistan says Afghan warplanes have mounted numerous air raids
on Pakistan's border villages and Afghan refugee camps to punish
the rebels, and also accuses Kabul of sponsoring terrorist bombings
in Pakistan.
   Wakil said that Kabul has brought 547 cases of violations of the
Geneva Accords on Afghanistan to the attention of Pakistan and the
U.N. Good Office Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan (UNGOMAP).
   He accused Pakistan of delaying UNGOMAP's investigation of the
alleged shipment and transfer of weapons across the border ``on the
pretext of the existence of tribal conflicts and lack of security.''
   Soviet Foreign Ministry Gennady Gerasimov said Thursday that
UNGOMAP officials are ``not doing their job properly'' and should
be investigated by the secretary-general if future peacekeeping
forces are to be approved.
   The Afghan Accords, signed April 14 in Geneva by Pakistan and
Afghanistan, with the Soviets and Americans as guarantors, call for
the Soviets to withdraw more than 100,000 Red Army troops from
Afghanistan, and for Afghanistan and Pakistan to respect each
other's territorial integrity.
   On Tuesday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnaze said
the Soviets had finished the first part of their troop withdrawal,
but had not yet begun the second phase, and said it depended on
whether the violations of the accord cease.
   U.N. observers have agreed that half the Soviet troops withdrew
by Aug. 15, so Shevardnadze's statement meant the Red Army retreat
has stopped for the last six weeks. The withdrawal began May 15,
and is to be complete by Feb. 15, 1989.
   Diego Cordovez, who mediated the Afghan Accord when he was a
U.N. undersecretary, said Thursday: ``I am surprised that Mr.
Gerasimov has been complaining about the monitoring mechanism
(UNGOMAP), because I had a one-and-a-half-hour meeting with Mr.
Shevardnadze and he said nothing to me about it.''
   Cordovez recently left his U.N. post to become foreign minister
of Ecuador.

Bias Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for the 311 Hispanic FBI agents
who successfully sued the agency for ethnic discrimination say they
hope the ruling will have a ``domino effect'' in rectifying bias.
   ``It's a landmark decision because discrimination against
Hispanics in this society is pervasive,'' said Antonio Silva,
co-counsel for the agents in the class action suit.
   The other co-counsel, Hugo Rodriguez, said Friday's decision
determined that the Department of Justice, of which the FBI is a
part, discriminates.
   ``If they do, it exists in other institutions in this country,''
he said.
   ``We're hoping that it'll have a domino effect, that people will
look at themselves and say, `Let's anticipate the problem before we
have it.'''
   The attorneys spoke at a news conference hours after U.S.
District Judge Lucius Bunton issued a 95-page opinion Friday that
said the FBI was guilty of ``a pattern and practice of
discrimination relating to conditions of employment and
promotions.''
   Bunton said the question of damages will be dealt with later.
   FBI Director William Sessions said he was disappointed by the
ruling, but added, ``discrimination has no place in the FBI.'' He
said the agency will decide later whether to appeal.
   In the meantime, he said, the FBI will continue to strengthen
its discrimination-complaint process and management-assessment
program.
   ``The FBI and I, as the director, are committed to increasing
the number of minority and female agents within the FBI's ranks
while ensuring promotional opportunities for these agents,''
Sessions said.
   The FBI's 437 Hispanic agents comprise 4.5 percent of the 9,574
agents; Hispanics make up about 8 percent of the U.S. population.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said he plans to meet with
Sessions to discuss the decision.
   ``It obviously raises some concern, and we'll follow through on
it,'' he said.
   The plaintiffs argued during a two-week, non-jury trial in
August that the FBI promotes Hispanic agents slower and assigns
them less-desirable jobs than other agents.
   The same could be said of other employers, Rodriguez said,
adding that Hispanic employees from several government agencies and
private corporations have called him to seek advice about what to
do about alleged discrimination.
   ``If I was a CEO of a major corporation, I think I would take a
long, hard look, not only at my product line as to whether we
address the Hispanic audience, but whether we are doing what is
just to Hispanic employees,'' Rodriguez said.
   Bunton agreed with the Hispanic agents' claims that they were
usually assigned to Spanish-language wiretaps, even if non-Hispanic
agents who were more fluent in Spanish were available.
   Working wiretaps is boring, lonely, uncomfortable work, agents
testified, and the low-glamour job goes unrecognized and unrewarded
when promotions are handed out.
   Bunton agreed with that, too, as well as with agents' assertions
that Hispanics are more likely to be called on to do dangerous
undercover work, even when non-Hispanics could do the job as well.
   The judge also accepted the plaintiffs' arguments that the
agency's discrimination-complaint process is weak, and that
Hispanics are rated unfairly low in the management-assessment
program, which they must complete with high scores to be considered
for higher management positions.
   ``Justice has been done,'' said FBI agent Bernardo ``Matt''
Perez, who was the highest-ranked Hispanic in the FBI when he filed
the original lawsuit five years ago. ``We now feel that we are
complete, first-rate American citizens and we have complete rights.
   ``This is going to better the FBI, and I hope that Sessions will
read this very closely.''

<HEAD>House To Vote On New Lobbying Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House vote is expected next week on
legislation that would impose the first-ever restrictions on
lobbying by ex-members of Congress and former presidents and vice
presidents.
   The House Judiciary Committee, by voice vote Friday, cleared the
measure for floor action late next week. In addition to its new
restrictions, the bill would expand existing lobbying prohibitions
on former executive branch employees.
   Senior Vice President Ann McBride, of the self-styled citizens'
lobby Common Cause, called the committee vote ``a major step
forward in the battle to enact this important ethics legislation.''
   The Senate already has approved its own set of lobbying
restrictions for those who quit the executive branch or leave
Congress. Both measures are aimed at those who leave the government
and then immediately lobby their former colleagues _ usually on
issues with which they were involved.
   The American Civil Liberties Union has sounded a cautionary
note, writing lawmakers that ``wholesale reform of the ethics laws
is neither necessary nor desirable. That is so because lobbying
activity is political speech that is at the core of the First
Amendment.''
   Indeed, during committee debate, several panel members who voted
for the legislation argued the new restrictions could violate the
constitutional right to free speech. And they said there was no
evidence of wrongdoing by ex-lawmakers-turned-lobbyists.
   Congress wrote the current set of anti-lobbying laws in the
post-Watergate 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Lawmakers did not
include themselves in the restrictions because they believed all
the abuses were in the executive branch.
   The Judiciary Committee added an amendment this week to include
former presidents and vice presidents in the restrictions, but it
defeated a proposal to restrict former federal judges from
appearing before their ex-colleagues for a year after leaving the
bench.
   Under the House bill, members of Congress would be banned for a
year from representing someone before any current member, officer
or employee of the house where they served. The restriction would
not apply to speeches or personal advice.
   Members' former personal office staffers and ex-committee
staffers would be prohibited from contacting their ex-bosses and
colleagues for the year-long period.
   The bill also would prevent former executive branch officers
from even ``aiding and advising'' someone on particular matters
they worked on in government. The language is aimed at
behind-the-scenes strategists who might direct lobbying efforts
without actually making government contacts themselves.
   In cases where the former officials had a policy or program
under their ``official responsibility,'' the bill also would
prevent them from ``aiding or advising'' for two years after
leaving government.
   The former executive branch officials already are banned from
``representing'' clients directly before the government for that
period.
   The measure also would impose a one-year ban on representing,
aiding and advising someone on a trade matter which was under the
ex-employee's official responsibility _ or in which he participated
personally in the last year of government service.
   There also would be changes in restrictions and coverage for
senior executive branch personnel, who generally would face a
one-year cooling-off period before lobbying former colleagues and
agencies.
   The House bill also would add civil penalties for violating the
lobbying law, thus giving the Justice Department a new option
against violators in cases where criminal penalties would not be
pursued.

   Cynthia Gregory and Fernando Bujones, two of
America's most exciting ballet dancers, are at the City Center this
week in a program called ``Cynthia Gregory & Fernando Bujones
Together!''
   The week was almost sold out before it began by fans of Miss
Gregory, a Los Angeles native who celebrated 20 years with American
Ballet Theater in 1985, and Miami-born Bujones, former member of
American Ballet Theater. Followers of that company wish it would
invite him to return.
   The two dancers have tentative plans to tour early next year.
   The evening on Thursday began with a most charming ballet, ``The
Rehearsal.'' On a stage set to look like a rehearsal hall, Ian
Horvath, formerly of Ballet Theater and now producing director of
the Jose Limon Dance Foundation, is directing a corps de ballet.
   Miss Gregory and Bujones do the lovers' first meeting in
``Giselle,'' a kitchen scene from ``Miss Julie,'' a duet from ``La
Sylphide,'' dancing more and more excitingly. They finish with a
duet from ``Don Quixote'' in which her technique was diamond sharp
and his dazzling dancing pushed up viewers' blood pressure.
   Donald Saddler created and staged ``The Rehearsal'' and Robert
W. Larkin wrote it.
   ``Beloved - Memories'' was choreographed for four couples by
Francis Patrelle. It was meant to be exotic and turned out banal,
but the four couples danced marvelously. ``Concertino,'' in two
brief movements, one showing a mood of anxiety and one of cheer,
was choreographed for Miss Gregory and Bujones by Lynne
Taylor-Corbett.
   The only dance not new for this engagement was the Act 3 wedding
from ``Coppelia.'' Miss Gregory had plenty of chances to balance on
one toe, standing as though that were easy and coming out of it
with perfect grace. She is a rarity, a ballerina whose technique is
crystal clear yet who conveys warmth. She always had the clarity
and has grown into the warmth.
   Bujones was exciting, flying through the sky with bravura yet
not looking like an egomaniac. The last time Miss Gregory and
Bujones danced together before this week was in 1985, in
``Coppelia.''

<HEAD>Blame Congress For Drug Agent Shortages, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blame for shortages of drug agents rests with
Congress, not the Reagan administration, says Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, who also pressed the Senate to act on a backlog of
nominees for federal judgeships.
   ``We are hearing these days on the campaign trail dramatic calls
for beefed-up anti-drug personnel _ more Drug Enforcement
Administation agents, more FBI agents, more prosecutors and so
on,'' Thornburgh told judges and lawyers Friday at the Philadelphia
Bar Association's annual conference.
   ``I hope those who are speaking this way in public will also
communicate the message directly to the Congress. For this
administration has gone to the Hill year after year with requests
for funds for more employees in our anti-drug efforts,'' he said.
   Thornburgh also pressed the Senate to confirm 29 pending
judicial nominations before the November elections. He said there
was ``no assurance that these highly qualified men and women will
be confirmed and positioned to fill crucial vacancies in our
federal courts before the Senate adjourns.''
   Among the nominees waiting for a hearing and a vote is
Philadelphia attorney Jay Waldman, a friend of Thornburgh's and one
of his former top advisers when Thornburgh was governor of
Pennsylvania.
   On another matter, Thornburgh told reporters he would meet with
FBI Director William Sessions to review a federal court ruling
Friday that the FBI discriminated against Hispanic agents in
promotions and working conditions.
   ``It obviously raises some concern, and we'll follow through on
it,'' Thornburgh said.
   In his speech, Thornburgh did not mention Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, who has made the war on
drugs a central part of his campaign. Dukakis has pledged to double
the 2,800 DEA agents over five years, beginning with an addition of
600 next year, and to add 800 new federal prosecutors in an effort
to speed up handling of drug cases.
   Thornburgh will chair his first drug policy board Monday since
becoming attorney general and said Reagan would attend for a review
of the anti-drug bills currently in Congress.
   The policy board is a Cabinet-level group which sets the course
for the Reagan administration's efforts against drugs.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has filed a lawsuit against
stores and manufacturers for allegedly failing to inform California
consumers about cancer-causing substances in tobacco products.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp said at a news
conference Friday that the lawsuit was filed in San Francisco
Superior Court against eight major retail chains, 25 manufacturers
of 200 brand named tobacco products and the Ingredient
Communication Council, a manufacturers and retailers group.
   The lawsuit, filed in the first major enforcement under a state
toxics warning law, seeks civil penalties up to $2,500 a day per
violation and could reach ``millions if not hundreds of millions of
dollars,'' Van de Kamp said.
   Resolution of this ``landmark'' case should set standards and
``send out a warning'' for other products containing chemicals
identified by state health authorities as known to cause cancer or
birth defects, Van de Kamp said.
   The U.S. Surgeon General requires warnings about cancer-causing
risks on packages of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and chewing
tobacco. But cigars, pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco require
no federal warnings.
   Deputy Attorney General Edward Weil said most stores named in
the lawsuit recently began some form of warnings, but investigators
have to determine if they are adequate.
   Van de Kamp said warnings on individual products probably would
be easiest and most effective, but many manufacturers don't want
warnings on goods shipped outside California and can't control
distribution to prevent that.
   Some tobacco manufacturers sent retailers warning signs after
the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 was
approved by voters, Weil said, but stores didn't post them. The law
is commonly known as Proposition 65.
   Most of the warning effort until recently was an 8{-by-11-inch
flyer from the manufacturers group, ICC, that is posted in stores.
   The ICC, which includes 60 manufacturers, retailers and
agricultural producers, provides the signs and maintains the 800
number. It was sued for allegedly misleading consumers and others
into believing that the phone service provides a legally adequate
warning.
   The ICC said that since February it has run newspaper
advertisements and has 62,000 signs in stores.
   Stores named in the lawsuit are Safeway, Ralph's, Lucky's, Alpha
Beta, Vons, Albertson's, Raley's and Thrifty.
   Manufacturers include: Culbro Corp., General Cigar, Consolidated
Cigar, American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson Tobacco, Royal
Factories, Sutliff Tobacco, Pinkerton Tobaccco, M&N Cigar, United
States Tobacco, Swedish Tobacco, Douwe Egberts, Lane Ltd., Larus &
Bros., Lorillard Inc., Havatampa, Phillies Cigar, Avanti Cigar,
Benson Int., John Middleton Inc., JNO H. Swisher & Son, House of
Windsor Inc. and Republic Tobacco.

   The Reagan administration has defied a
congressional mandate by failing to make available surplus federal
property to the homeless, a federal judge has ruled.
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch said the
administration's interpretation of the 1987 McKinney Act
``arbitrarily restricts the scope of the statute.''
   Gasch said the law, named after the late Rep. Stewart B.
McKinney, R-Conn., who died a few months after it was enacted in
1987, ``is designed to make surplus federal property available to
assist the homeless.''
   Agreeing with the National Coalition for the Homeless, he said
only 12 facilities have been identified as underused by federal
agencies and only two have been made available to the homeless.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development spokesman Bob Nipp
said the decision will require the agency to review federal surveys
of surplus buildings to determine which are suitable for housing.
   HUD general counsel J. Michael Dorsey said he did not know how
many properties would be involved. He said the order, however, does
not apply to single-unit dwellings taken over by HUD or the
Veterans Administration because of defaults on government-backed
housing loans.
   Sales of HUD houses will continue, said Dorsey who described the
decision as generally positive because it could help identify
additional buildings that might be used for the homeless.
   ``The order directs us to do more in more detail than we thought
we had done in substantial compliance with the law,'' he said.
   The decision said: ``It's unreasonable to suggest that Congress
chose to lease to the homeless half-empty properties and properties
which are used part of the time, but not properties which are
wholly unoccupied.''
   Gasch said, ``The court is persuaded that the defendants are not
properly implementing the (law). Pitifully few of the numerous
unused federal properties are being evaluated for their suitability
to assist the homeless. Those that are found to be suitable are not
being made available to homeless providers.''
   Ms. Maria Foscarinis, who represented the homeless coalition,
called the ruling a ``terrific decision.''
   ``The judge clearly and strongly holds that the administration
has been violating the law in not making available underused
federal property to the homeless,'' she said.
   Ms. Foscarinis said in a telephone interview from New York that
the significance of the ruling is that ``tens of thousands of
properties across the country can now be used to save lives.''
   She said the buildings, now standing vacant or partially used,
include barracks on military bases, Veteran Administration
hospitals and Post Office buildings.
   Nine days ago, Gasch refused to bar the Department of Housing
and Urban Development from selling single-family homes it had
acquired through mortgage foreclosures to the highest bidder.
   He issued an order denying a preliminary injunction requested by
a coalition of advocates for the homeless who had sought to block
HUD from selling 47,000 foreclosed houses in its inventory.

<HEAD>Greek Prime Minister `Satisfactory' After Heart Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAREFIELD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou was reported in satisfactory condition today after
successfully undergoing a six-hour heart operation.
   Egyptian-born Magdi Yacoub, one of Britain's top heart surgeons
who lead the medical team that performed the operation, said in a
statement that the 69-year-old Papandreou was progressing
satisfactorily in the intensive care unit of Harefield Hospital.
   The operation at the hospital 17 miles northwest of central
London took place Friday.
   Papandreou regained consciousness Friday night after the
operation and was visited by his daughter and three sons, said
Vasilis Kapetanyannis, a Greek Embassy press officer at the
hospital.
   Kapetanyannis made no mention of the prime minister's friend
Dimitra Liani, a former stewardess with the Greek national airline
Olympic Airways who was shown in news pictures earlier this month
strolling with Papandreou in the hospital grounds.
   But state-run Greek television said 34-year-old Ms. Liani was
among a small group allowed into the operating room Friday.
   Papandreou, currently president of the 12-nation European
Economic Community under its rotating presidency system, flew to
London Aug. 25 after his heart condition suddenly worsened.
   He underwent pre-surgical treatment for a narrowing of the
aorta, the main blood vessel carrying blood from the heart. Greek
officials said the main operation was delayed until Friday to clear
a liver disorder linked to the heart problem.
   After Papandreou arrived in Britain, his government announced he
would divorce Margaret, his American-born wife of 37 years. Ms.
Liani is divorcing her husband, architect Alexis Kapopoulous, 43, a
former prominent member of the pro-Maoist Revolutionary Communist
Party. Papandreou has said he plans to marry her.
   Embassy staff said Mrs. Papandreou, the former Margaret Chant of
Elmhurst, Ill., was not in London. Papandreou married her in 1951
when he was teaching economics at the University of Minnesota.
   On Friday, before the operation, Ms. Liani told a reporter: ``I
am praying for a good result.''
   Embassy press attache Dr. Nicholas Papadakis said Friday night:
``Everything is fine. The operation was successful.''
   Shortly after the operation was completed, hospital general
manager David Thomson told a news conference: ``The prime minister
of Greece today (Friday) underwent an operation for replacement of
his aortic valve using a human valve. This was combined with
insertion of three bypass grafts and the clearing of the diseased
coronary artery, to improve the heart function.''
   After reading the statement in English, Thomson left the room
irritably as Giannis Floris, the Greek minister for health, welfare
and social insurance, began explaining the medical terms in Greek
to the 50 Greek press, radio and TV representatives present.
   Papandreou, who will be 70 next Feb. 5, was first elected prime
minister in October 1981 when his Panhellenic Socialist Movement
(PASOK) won a landslide victoy. He won a second term in June 1985.

Convictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indictments charging 27 pilots with
concealing drug and alcohol-related convictions are the first of
hundreds expected from a nationwide investigation, officials said.
   Twenty-seven commercial, private and student pilots were
indicted Friday, accused of failing to reveal the convictions on
medical certificates submitted to the Federal Aviation
Administration for their pilot's license.
   The indictments were the first in a nationwide crackdown on drug
and alcohol abuse in the transportation industry, federal
authorities said.
   ``The inspector general's office currently has investigations
under way in all 50 states, and hundreds of further such
indictments are expected,'' Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley
said in Washington.
   Twelve current or former commercial pilots were among those
charged, including a pilot with Delta Air Lines who works as a
second officer aboard an L-1011. That pilot and a former Pan
American pilot were the only ones identified as employees of major
passenger carriers.
   A Delta spokeswoman in Atlanta said the pilot would be suspended
once the airline is formally notified of the indictment.
   All but three of the 27 are from Florida.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman said authorities knew of no mishaps
involving the individuals charged.
   The pilot-applicants stated on their medical certificates they
had no record of traffic or other convictions when in fact they had
been convicted of drug or alcohol-related offenses, according to
the indictment.
   The convictions included drunken driving, possession of
marijuana and trafficking in cocaine.
   Investigators tracked down the pilots by matching computer files
of the FAA with those of motor vehicle departments and the FBI.
   A conviction would not necessarily preclude a pilot from getting
a medical certificate and pilot's license, said FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar.
   But he said a past conviction would cause an FAA medical
examiner to ``look long and hard at the circumstances. He may have
concluded (the pilot) should not have a medical certificate.''
   Burnley said the charges were ``indicative of the serious
problem of drug and alcohol abuse, which has permeated all walks of
life and all professions in our society.''
   The charges grew out of a two-year investigation that began with
an audit of the national driver's registry to uncover alcohol or
drug-related traffic violations, said Ben Lorigo of the
Transportation Department's inspector general's office in
Washington.
   The Transportation Department has proposed a broad range of drug
tests, including random tests, of commercial airline pilots and
other flight crew personnel.
   If convicted, the pilots could face at least five years in
prison and fines ranging from $5,000 to $250,000.

   Gunmen sped into this southern town
Friday in cars and shot and killed about 140 people, hospital
officials and eyewitnesses said. Rioting that killed at least 15
people followed in Karachi on Saturday.
   A curfew has been slapped on Hyderabad, located about 108 miles
south of Karachi in Pakistan's southern province of Sind.
   Police and government officials are refusing to release the
death toll in the Hyderabad violence but a check of five hospital's
in this panic-stricken city revealed 140 dead and another 170
injured.
   No one has claimed responsibility but both Hyderabad and Karachi
have been the scene of bloody ethnic clashes in the past. The two
factions usually taking aim at each other are the Sind separatists,
demanding independence for the Sind region, and Mohajirs or
refugees who came to Pakistan after partition from India.
   Most of the dead in Hyderabad were Mohajirs while casualties in
Karachi were mostly Sind.
   Eyewitnesses in Hyderabad said gunmen opened fire from speeding
vehicles on businesses and residential areas. The figure varied
with each eyewitness but reports claim at least 15 vehicles were
involved in the shooting.
   Troops flooded both Karachi and Hyderabad. No shooting was
reported between soldiers and civilians.

<TEXT>
   Thomas Reed, a longtime state lawmaker and
Alabama NAACP president, says he won't give up his legislative seat
despite his conviction for accepting $10,000 to try to obtain early
parole for a convicted murderer.
   But Attorney General Don Siegelman, citing the Alabama
Constitution and state law, said Reed's conviction disqualified him
as a state representative and he must resign immediately.
   ``I'm not necessarily shocked, but I am disappointed,'' Reed
said of the jury's verdict Friday.
   At a news conference, the Tuskegee Democrat continued to blame
his prosecution on his attempt to remove the Confederate flag from
atop the Alabama Capitol _ a move that drew national attention. His
trial was moved to Mobile because of publicity about the case in
Montgomery.
   ``You know and I know were it not for the Confederate battle
flag I probably would not be here today,'' he said.
   Reed and 13 other black legislators await trial in state court
in Montgomery on misdemeanor trespassing charges stemming from
their mostly symbolic bid to remove the flag from the Capitol Feb.
2.
   That trial was postponed Friday by District Judge Craig Miller.
No new date was set.
   The jury Friday found Reed guilty of extortion and of inducing a
Columbus, Ga., businessman to travel to Tuskegee, Ala., to commit
the crime.
   Reed, 60, the Alabama head of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People as well as the senior black in the
state Legislature, was found innocent on three remaining charges,
including accepting restaurant equipment from the businessman,
Bobby Gene Chesser, as a bribe in the 1986 bid to free Chesser's
nephew.
   The nephew, Anthony Dennis Chesser, is serving a 40-year
sentence for killing his wife four years ago. His bid to seek early
parole failed.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina did not immediately set a
sentencing date.
   Reed, who shook hands with the judge before leaving, could
receive a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the
extortion count, and a five-year term and a $250,000 fine on the
lesser charge.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks declined to comment
on the verdict. But he described Reed as a ``positive force in the
area of civil rights for a number of years and we respect his
service.''
   Reed, who in 1970 became one of the first two blacks elected to
the Alabama Legislature this century, said ``by no means'' would he
vacate his seat in the state House of Representatives.
   Vowing to appeal, defense attorney Bill Baxley, a former state
attorney general and ex-lieutenant governor, said his opinion was
that Reed's removal would be up to the House.
   But in a letter dated Friday to Reed, Siegelman wrote that Reed
must leave office immediately or Siegelman would take legal action
to have him removed.
   Siegelman said Reed would be restored to office if his
conviction was reversed.

<HEAD>Eastern Unions Say Fight Against Job Cuts Not Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' unions say their fight to save
3,000 jobs isn't over even though a federal appeals panel ruled the
financially troubled carrier had ``ample reason for these
reductions.''
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington approved the job cuts Friday and rejected union
contentions that Eastern management was illegally undercutting the
bargaining power of its pilots, flight attendants and machinists'
unions.
   The court said the layoffs resulting from service cuts to 14
cities were a legitimate effort to staunch losses, which Eastern
estimated at $1 million a day during this year's second quarter.
Since 1980, the Miami-based carrier has lost $1 billion and blames
much of its troubles on its unions.
   The unions ``have directed our attention to nothing that would
undermine Eastern's claim that legitimate business concerns provide
an ample reason for these reductions,'' Judge Stephen Williams
wrote for the unanimous panel.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker erred in granting the
unions an injunction last month to halt the layoffs because the
dispute between the Texas Air Corp. subsidiary and its unions was
minor under federal labor law, Williams wrote.
   ``It was certainly disappointing, it didn't come as a shock. We
knew, or I had the impression, this was a conservative panel, but
we had faith in Judge Parker's ruling,'' said Charles Bryan, head
of Miami's machinists' union local, which represents about 9,500
mechanics and ground workers.
   ``What our options are right now is to ask for a full review by
the 11-member panel (of the appeals court). We can do that or have
remanded it back to Judge Parker for full trial,'' Bryan said.
   The Air Line Pilots Association will ask for a hearing by the
full appeals court, said union spokesman Ron Cole in Florida.
   The Transport Workers Union, representing about 6,700 flight
attendants, was unsure what action it would take, said Nancy
Currier, vice president of the Miami local.
   Eastern lawyer Michael Madigan in Washington said, ``We regard
this as an enormously significant ruling for Eastern and for the
airline industry as a whole.''
   Eastern in July announced plans to sell planes, cut unprofitable
routes, close its Kansas City hub and lay off 4,000 workers on Aug.
31. Job cuts included management, union and non-union workers.
Because some workers quit, retired or took unpaid leaves, about
3,000 were laid off.
   The carrier is banking on savings of up to $120 million from
service cuts and of slicing $7 million monthly from its payroll.
   The unions quickly challenged the plan, which they viewed as a
ploy by Eastern's parent to dismantle the company and hurt
organized labor. Since Texas Air bought Eastern in 1986, Eastern's
work force has shrunk from about 42,000 to 30,000.
   Meanwhile, in Cambridge, Mass., Eastern workers gathered Friday
on the banks of the Charles River to protest what they characterize
as the union-busting tactics of Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
whose Harvard Business School class was holding its 25th
anniversary this weekend.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson canceled a speech at Memphis State
University to address the rally, which was within earshot of the
building where Lorenzo's classmates were gathering. A Harvard
official said, however, that Lorenzo was not present.

<HEAD>Reagan Campaigns In Illinois; Dukakis Heads West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan stumped in Illinois for his vice president,
courting conservative Democrats and independents, while Democrat
Michael Dukakis went west to score the Reagan administration on its
farm and environmental records.
   George Bush responded to Dukakis in kind, making his third trip
into Dukakis' home state of Massachusetts to pick up another
endorsement from police unions. Bush also visited New Jersey and
Connecticut.
   Both vice presidential nominees _ Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle _ began a weekend of intensive preparation
for their debate Wednesday in Omaha, Neb.
   Reagan took the campaign to Chicago, a Democratic stronghold
that Bush bypassed earlier in the week during a bus tour of small
towns in central and northern Illinois.
   Besides attending fund-raisers, Reagan courted
conservative-minded Democrats and independent voters in ethnic
communities, many of whose votes helped Reagan and Bush carry the
state in the last two elections.
   ``The liberals may try to mouth some of our words, but when they
talk about `values' and `family' they mean something very
different,'' he told an audience of 1,500 in a Polish social hall.
   Dukakis' California sojourn included a trip to the Stringfellow
Acid Pits, one of the most notorious toxic waste sites in the
country.
   Dukakis, who has been criticized for being too slow to attack
the pollution problem in Boston Harbor, called a recently initiated
cleanup ``one of the finer achievements'' of his administration and
``the largest single water cleanup project in America.''
   He said his state's toxic waste cleanup program has cleaned up
nearly 300 sites and is working on another 400. ``The current
administration has completed about 25 or 30,'' he said.
   In Idalou, Texas, Dukakis pledged to set aside a $100 million
``Fund to Rebuild America'' for business financing in rural
communities. He also pointed to his proposals for improving rural
health care and increasing education aid.
   ``The Republicans put America on the auction block,'' Dukakis
said. ``They've been selling off our farms and businesses and banks
and real estate'' to foreign investors.
   Campaigning in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Connecticut, Bush
found police organizations ready to take up his cause. His attacks
on the American Civil Liberties Union were echoed by Passaic
County, N.J., Sheriff Edwin Englehardt.
   Police ``don't want a man in that White House who is a
sympathizer and a card-carrying member of the ACLU, that great
organization that's against everything that's right for America,''
Englehardt said.
   In Springfield, Mass., where he collected the endorsement of
police unions, Bush suggested Dukakis was trying to conceal his own
record: ``I am running as myself, and my opponent is running from
himself.''
   Quayle, who campaigned briefly in Philadelphia on Friday, was
going to conduct a formal mock debate today with Sen. Bob Packwod,
R-Ore., who is standing in for Bentsen.
   Bentsen, accepting the National Education Association's
endorsement of the Democratic ticket, said the vice president's
talk of balancing the federal budget and serving as the education
president is ``as empty as Dan Quayle's resume.''
   In other political news:
   _ Panelists were chosen for Wednesday's vice presidential
debate. Judy Woodruff of the MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour will be
moderator. The panelists are Jon Margolis of the Chicago Tribune,
Britt Hume of ABC and Tom Brokaw of NBC.
   _ A Gallup survey of 1,020 registered voters indicated Bush was
the choice of 47 percent, Dukakis 42 percent. The survey, conducted
Tuesday and Wednesday, had a 3 point margin of error. A Los Angeles
Times poll conducted by calling back voters who had been
interviewed just before and then just after the Sunday's
presidential debate found the race still a tie, at 45-45. The new
callback poll, conducted Thursday, had 622 respondents and a
5-point margin of error.
   _ The Seattle Times, which has endorsed only Republican
presidential candidates since 1920, endorsed Michael Dukakis. The
endorsement will appear in an editorial Sunday.
   _ Bush spokesman Steve Hart disputed as ``absolutely untrue'' a
contention by former Central Intelligence Agency director
Stansfield Turner that Bush had rehired Panamanian military leader
Manual Antonio Noriega as a CIA source. Turner said Friday in
interviews with several news organizations that he dismissed
Noriega in 1976 because he was an ``unscrupulous character.''
   Dukakis has criticized the administration for its support of
Noriega until just recently. Bush said in Sunday's debate that
``seven administrations'' had dealt with the military leader who is
under a drug indictment in the United States.
   _ The Dukakis campaign began airing a 30-second advertising spot
during Friday night's Olympic coverage. Called ``The packaging of
George Bush,'' the ad carries the message that Bush is using the
patriotism issue because he has no programs or proposals for
middle-class Americans.

<HEAD>Ad Campaign Urges Condom Use To Block AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's three major TV networks say they
will join an advertising campaign urging sexually active Americans
to use condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS.
   The commercials, direct and fraught with emotion, were released
Friday by the nation's leading producer of public-service
announcements, The Advertising Council.
   Several national publications also said they would run print
versions.
   ``The public service campaign of The Advertising Council may
offend some people. I'm truly sorry about that,'' said U.S. Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop, who endorsed the campaign at a Manhattan
news conference. ``You cannot ignore people who might not have your
own morality.''
   Critics of the ads called them misleading because condoms are
not foolproof.
   ``People will use condoms, feel protected, and still get AIDS
and die,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, executive director of the
American Council on Science and Health.
   ``There is no such thing as safe sex when it comes to AIDS,''
said Monsignor John Woolsey, director of the Office of Christian
and Family Development for the Archdiocese of New York. ``Recent
studies indicate that the failure rate for condoms is overwhelming,
perhaps as high as 40 percent. ... There is only one sure way to
prevent AIDS: abstinence.''
   But Koop called abstinence ``not a viable option for most
people.'' He said many people also are not monogamous.
   Though AIDS has not spread among heterosexuals nearly as rapidly
as it swept the homosexual population, he said, it can be spread
through heterosexual sex.
   The television spots include one in which a youth standing in a
rainstorm says: ``My brother wouldn't listen to me. I told him,
`You have sex, you use condoms so you don't get AIDS.' He laughed
and said condoms weren't macho.''
   The youth then crumples to a sitting position, and the camera
shows that he is in a cemetery. ``My brother,'' he says. ``He was
so macho.''
   The print ads are equally direct. One simply carries a photo of
a rolled condom. The legend says: ``Using it won't kill you. Not
using it might.''
   ABC and NBC ran similar messages last year, although CBS did not.
   ``A lot has happened since that time. There's a national
awareness and we want to be part of the awareness program,'' said
CBS spokesman George Schweitzer.
   He said CBS would air two of the spots, only after 9 p.m. ABC
did not set a time restriction. NBC had no formal restriction but
said the spots were unlikely to appear before 9 p.m.
   Although ad campaigns have urged the use of condoms before, the
new effort carries added clout through the participation of The
Advertising Council, which has produced several highly successful
public service campaigns, such as the ``Take a Bite Out of Crime''
promotion.
   The council, sponsored by the advertising and communications
industries, distributes its public-service ads to media outlets for
use at their discretion.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The swelling ranks of minorities in the work place
and an aging work force will make affirmative action a ``business
necessity'' in the next decade, Labor Secretary Anne McLaughlin
says.
   ``Affirmative action is no longer just a matter of social
responsibility. It's not just a matter of legal compulsion,'' she
said Friday. ``In the future, the market will make it a fact of
life.''
   In a speech to a conference of industrial human services
specialists, she said:
   ``I take seriously our responsibility at the department to
assure that equal opportunity has real meaning _ and that we as a
nation and more particularly as a government lead by example.''
   Labor Department studies point to a challenge for business in
the decade ahead, she said.
   The rate of new workers entering the labor market is expected to
be the lowest since World War II, and the average age of workers is
expected to rise from 36 to 39.
   Nearly two-thirds of those entering the job market between now
and the year 2000 will be women, she said, and more immigrants will
be in the work force than any time since World War II.
   ``The next challenge for business will be the quiet revolution
ushered in by a new work force'' increasingly composed of women,
minorities, the disabled and older workers, she said.
   Affirmative action will play a central role, she said. ``Not
merely the traditional social or altruistic perspective of
affirmative action,'' she said, ``but affirmative action as it has
evolved _ as a business necessity.''
   McLaughlin said those efforts must be aimed at preparing the
work force for the jobs now being created, investing in public
education and adjusting to the child care and other demands of the

   The onus is on the private sector, she said, adding ``federal
solutions to local problems are in nobody's best interest.''
   ``If corporate America doesn't take the lead in developing
talent now,'' she said, ``it will pay more for talent later.''

<HEAD>ACLU Director Criticizes Bush and Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the American Civil Liberties
Union had criticism for both Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Ira Glasser, the ACLU's national director, told the Cleveland
City Club on Friday that Bush made inaccurate statements about the
ACLU in Sunday's presidential debate. Glasser criticized Dukakis
for taking the easy way out in defending his stance on the Pledge
of Allegiance.
   Dukakis vetoed a 1977 bill that would have required
Massachusetts public school teachers to lead students in the pledge
daily. He cited an advisory opinion from the Massachusetts Supreme
Court for his veto.
   ``I think the Bush people and the Dukakis people are taking the
same strategy,'' said Glasser. ``It's too hard to explain.''
   Glasser said Bush is pushing for the pledge requirement because
it is a good campaign issue, despite its unconstitutionality, while
Dukakis is ignoring the issue because of its complexity.

<HEAD>Evidence Forces Former State Senator to Plead Guilty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story of a former state senator reads
like a Hollywood script: a dramatically staged drowning, a two-year
manhunt spanning four continents, and tales of torture in an island
jail.
   And just as his flight began three years ago on Labor Day when
he faked his own scuba-diving death to avoid prosecution, David
Friedland ended the tale in much the same dramatic way.
   In a surprise move, four days after testimony began in federal
court in Camden in his pension-fund fraud trial, Friedland abruptly
ended his trial Thursday by pleading guilty to one count of
racketeering.
   A 47-count indictment charged the 50-year-old Friedland with
heading a scheme to defraud $20 million from the pension fund of
Teamsters Local 701 in North Brunswick.
   ``I want to get this episode of my life over with,'' Friedland
said after his guilty plea. ``I want to look ahead, not at the
past.''
   Two weeks earlier during jury selection, a relaxed and smiling
Friedland said he was looking forward to the trial and exonerating
himself. Three co-defendants already had been convicted in the case.
   ``As they say, `the truth will set you free,''' Friedland said
at the time.
   Defense attorneys said they were battling unbeatable odds in the
case, which included an 11-page statement that Friedland gave to a
federal agent after his capture in the Maldive Islands in the
Indian Ocean.
   There was also the testimony of Joseph J. Higgins, Friedland's
former partner in a bogus mortgage company set up in Florida to
skim money from the pension fund.
   In return for the guilty plea, prosecutors said they dropped
remaining charges against Friedland, including perjury, mail and
wire fraud, and violating the Employee Retirement Income Act.
   The plea bargain includes a provision not to prosecute Friedland
for his global flight, said John Yacovelle, one of Friedland's
attorneys.
   Yacovelle said defense attorneys had been negotiating with the
government for several months to reach an agreement.
   Friedland faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when he
is sentenced Oct. 28 before Chief U.S. District Judge John F. Gerry.
   Federal authorities say Friedland, a flamboyant, disbarred
lawyer, staged a fake drowning in the Bahamas on Labor Day 1985,
just before he was indicted along with the two union pension fund
trustees and the fund's lawyer.
   His disappearance also came three weeks before a hearing on his
request for a reduction of a seven-year prison sentence for a 1980
conviction of taking $360,000 for arranging a $4 million loan from
the same pension fund. Friedland is serving that sentence at Mercer
County jail in Trenton.
   Friedland spent 26 months in Africa, Asia and Europe before his
arrest Dec. 12 in the Maldives. While in the islands, prosecutors
say Friedland ran five scuba diving shops under the name Richard
Harley.
   During the return flight to the United States, Friedland gave a
detailed statement to a federal agent. He later attempted to
suppress that statement, saying he was thinking unclearly because
of conditions of his confinement while he was held by Maldivian
authorities coupled with the effects of medication he was taking.
   Friedland said that whenever he tried to sleep, his jailers
awakened him by smashing a stick against his bunk.
   Friedland said he became so desperate to remain on the islands
that he contacted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi asking for
sanctuary. At one point, he said, he saw a vision of a hooded
figure _ the prophet Mohammed _ beckoning him to convert to the
Islamic faith.
   ``I began to believe Mohammed was the prophet of God,''
Friedland testified. ``I heard a voice say `God is now.'''

<TEXT>
   Doctors' errors led to as many as one-quarter
of the deaths of patients being treated for heart ailments, strokes
and pneumonia in 12 hospitals studied by the Rand Corp.
   But the researchers cautioned against assuming the results apply
to all of the nation's hospitals.
   Physicians improperly treated patients complaining of chest
pains, prescribed the wrong kind of antibiotics for pneumonia and
misdiagnosed strokes, according to the study published in today's
edition of The Annals of Internal Medicine.
   The study noted that the findings are preliminary, and that the
errors were common and relatively easy to correct.
   ``A hospital's quality assurance committee should approach these
findings with a certain sense of optimism,'' the study said.
``Although these probably preventable deaths occurred with what we
consider surprising frequency, they were due to a small number of
... causes.''
   All three of the physician-panelists who reviewed the 12
hospitals' records agreed that 14 percent of the deaths probably
could have been prevented. Two of the three agreed that 27 percent
of the deaths were probably preventable, the study said.
   Dr. Robert W. Dubois, who headed the study, said hospital
patients should not be alarmed.
   ``The overwhelming majority _ over 95 percent _ of the people
admitted to a hospital don't die. This is a non-issue for them,''
he said. ``So it's important to put this in perspective. Of the
one-quarter to one-sixth of those who do die, their death was
probably preventable.''
   The study by the Rand Corp., a Santa Monica-based think tank,
was based on a review of 182 patients who died in 1985 at hospitals
owned by American Medical International of Beverly Hills, a chain
of 115 hospitals in the United States and abroad.
   AMI sponsored the study and made extensive changes in its
quality control program based on findings that were privately
released, a spokesman said.
   AMI spokesman Mick Taylor said the study should send warning
signals to other hosptials.
   ``It suggests there still remains a need for control mechanisms
that very precisely define what quality is, and then very closely
monitor every activity within a hospital that impacts a patient,''
Taylor said.
   The study found that the average patient whose death might have
been prevented was between ages 75 and 79, and suffered less severe
illnesses than those whose deaths were unavoidable.
   The deaths of 23 heart attack patients probably could have been
prevented had doctors not made errors in treatment, the majority of
panelists said.
   For instance, the study found that a number of patients received
either no treatment or only single doses of nitroglycerine or
morphine after complaining of chest pains.
   The study suggested that doctors should have been more
aggressive in the treatment, intervening with drugs or surgery to
avert what would be fatal heart attacks.
   Errors in diagnosis were the main cause of nine deaths from
strokes, the majority of panelists found. In some cases, doctors
failed to administer such diagnostic procedures as a spinal tap and
blood cultures.
   The majority of panelists also found that errors in both
diagnosis and treatment led to 17 deaths from pneumonia.

   A jury at an inquest ruled that the killings of
three unarmed IRA members by British commandos in March were legal.
   Foreman Daniel Gabay said the 11-member panel voted 9-2 on
Friday for the lawful killing verdicts.
   Commandos of the British Special Air Service, or SAS, regiment
shot the three on March 6 as they walked in this British colony
toward the Spanish border. The victims were Daniel McCann, 30; Sean
Savage, 24; and Mairead Farrell, 31.
   The commandos testified they believed the Irish Republican Army
members were prepared to detonate a car bomb by remote control and
made threatening moves when confronted.
   The outlawed IRA has acknowledged the three were group members
on ``active service,'' meaning they were on a mission to strike
against a British target at the time of their deaths.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government
have claimed the killings were part of an unofficial
``shoot-to-kill'' policy against members of the IRA, which seeks
independence for Northern Ireland and union with the Republic of
Ireland.
   ``This is a Pyrrhic victory for the Crown Counsel. There was a
split decision,'' said Niall Farrell, brother of Ms. Farrell, in
Gibraltar after announcement of the jury's verdict.
   ``We've seen the evidence. Sean was shot on the ground. Mairead
and Dan were shot in the back while lying on the ground.''
   The inquest, headed by Coroner Felix Pizzarello, had no power of
prosecution. Its sole aim was to determine whether the shootings
were lawful. A verdict of unlawful killing could have led to
criminal indictments.
   Britain welcomed the decision.
   ``To fight terrorism and to protect innocent lives, the use of
force by the security forces is, regrettably, sometimes
unavoidable,'' said a Defense Ministry official in London, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British practice.
   ``Such action must at all times be within the law. This
principle was fully upheld,'' the official added.
   In Dublin, a government statement said Irish Prime Minister
Charles Haughey and his Cabinet would review the verdicts in detail
before commenting.
   Niall Farrell, calling the commandos ``a bunch of murderers''
and the verdict a ``travesty of justice,'' asked Haughey to pursue
the case in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg,
France.
   In his summation, Pizzarello asked the jury to reach a unanimous
verdict either for justifiable homicide or unlawful killing. He
later said a split decision was acceptable.
   ``I don't see it as a victory or anything else,'' Crown Counsel
John Laws told reporters. ``We've had a good judicial inquiry
according to British law applied to Gibraltar and that's all there
is to it.''
   After the three were killed, they were found to be unarmed, and
the car Savage had parked was found not to contain any explosives
or timing devices.
   Two days later, Spanish police found a car packed with
explosives in Marbella, 48 miles away. The car had been rented to
one of the dead.

   Patients with kidneys impaired by high
blood pressure may halt kidney deterioration and even see
improvements with stricter control of blood pressure levels,
research suggests.
   The discovery, which contradicts some research on animals that
indicated kidney disease is unstoppable once damage has occurred,
was announced Friday by William Pettinger, professor of internal
medicine and director of the Midwest Hypertension Research
Institute at Creighton University School of Medicine.
   The finding suggests that conventional drugs could be used more
aggressively to control blood pressure and protect kidneys.
   Nearly 60 million Americans face a much higher risk of stroke or
heart attack because they suffer from high blood pressure. Kidney
damage is a direct result of the affliction, Pettinger said,
although not all hypertension patients suffer impaired kidney
functioning.
   Joseph Izzo, associate professor of medicine and pharmacology at
the State University of New York at Buffalo, said Pettinger's
research underscores previous findings.
   ``You have to consider it significant and it's in light of a
longstanding body of information ... that pressure accelerates
damage to the kidneys,'' said Izzo. ``Since we can control
pressure, we ought to.''
   Damaged kidneys are less able to filter impurities from the
blood, allowing substances that are normally excreted to build up,
including urea.
   Aggressive control of blood pressure ``not only protects kidney
function, but you actually get some return of function,'' said
Pettinger, who reported his findings at a conference of the
American Heart Association's Council for High Blood Pressure
Research.
   ``We've been able to conserve (kidney) function in the vast
majority of patients, even those who started with 50 to 75 percent
(kidney) damage,'' he said.
   Pettinger said he will continue to research an apparent
correlation between improved kidney function and reduced intake of
drugs to treat high blood pressure.
   ``With constant good control of blood pressure, the mechanisms
which sustain high blood pressure appear to be reduced and a
smaller amount of drugs are required to control the blood
pressure,'' he said.
   Pettinger's study involved 18 patients who were treated with
conventional drugs for high blood pressure.
   In a second announcement Friday, researchers at the University
of California at San Francisco revealed that two tests may help
detect coronary artery disease in patients with mild high blood
pressure before symptoms develop.
   Coronary artery disease is caused by fat that builds up in the
walls of blood vessels in the three main arteries of the heart. It
often goes undetected until a patient suffers a heart attack, pain
or sudden death. One-third of sufferers die suddenly, without any
warning of the condition.
   Brian O'Kelly, a cardiology research fellow at UCSF and a
clinical fellow at the Albert Heritage Foundation for Medical
Research in Alberta, Canada, reported preliminary findings that
suggest two tests used to diagnose heart disease may prove useful
in early detection of ``silent'' coronary artery disease.
   Patients with mild high blood pressure are more likely to suffer
from arterial blockage than those with normal blood pressure,
although researchers are not sure what the relationship is, said
O'Kelly.
   Until now, treatment of high blood pressure has successfully
reduced the incidence of strokes, kidney failure and heart failure,
he said, but it has failed to reduce the incidence of fatal heart
attacks and hardening of the arteries.
   Researchers theorize the reason is that the disease is present
before treatment begins.
   O'Kelly hopes the tests will help identify people at high risk
of developing symptomatic heart disease in time to begin aggressive
treatment. Successful early detection could also help develop more
effective ways to avoid heart attacks, he said.

<HEAD>Stansfield Turner Says Bush Restored Noriega As CIA Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush reinstated
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega as a paid intelligence
source after he was dropped by the Central Intelligence Agency,
according to former CIA director Stansfield Turner.
   The allegation by Turner were termed as ``absolutely untrue''
Friday by a Bush spokesman.
   The vice president in his recent debate with Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis suggested it was unfair to
blame only the Reagan administration for U.S. links with Noriega
because, he said, ``seven adminstrations'' had condoned such ties.
   Noriega this year was indicted in Miami on drug charges.
   Turner, who was head of the CIA in the Carter administration,
said Friday he removed Noriega as a paid intelligence source in
1976 but when the Reagan adminstration took over Bush in l981 met
with Noriega ``and put him back on the payroll.''
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said that as vice president Bush had
only one meeting that Noriega attended, and that was in 1983 when
Bush was also meeting with the Panamanian president and other
officials.
   Turner in interviews with CBS, NBC and other news organizations
said he severed the CIA's ties with Noriega because the Panamanian
leader was an ``unscrupulous character.''
   Dukakis has made a campaign issue of the Reagan administration's
support of Noriega, the de facto ruler of Panama, saying in
Sunday's debate, ``We've been dealing with him, he's been dealing
drugs to our kids.''
   Bush replied that the administration moved swiftly to indict
Noriega as soon as it had evidence.
   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Turner at his Phoenix
hotel room and at his Washington residence were unsuccessful.
According to The Washington Post, the Dukakis campaign was
encouraging news organizations to call Turner about Noriega and
supplied the Phoenix number.

<HEAD>Empty Raft All That Remains of Four Cubans' Freedom Float</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An empty inner-tube raft, a knapsack and
water-soaked notes are all that remain of a doomed effort by four
young Cubans who tried to flee their homeland, immigration
officials said.
   The apparent deaths of the four youths who left Cuba on Sept. 6
_ just as Hurricane Gilbert was about to strike _ spotlights the
dangers of such freedom floats, said Perry Rivkind, district
director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``Well over 50 percent of them never make it to the United
States,'' Rivkind said Friday. ``But they keep on coming. It's an
indication of how desperate the situation is.''
   Rivkind said 26 people have successfully negotiated the Florida
Straits on inner-tube rafts in the past year. It is 90 miles from
the Cuban coast to Key West, but ocean currents generally carry
rafts much farther. It is about 200 miles to Miami, and survivors
have been picked up farther north.
   Rivkind is certain many others did not make it, but this is one
of the few times a raft has been found and relatives could confirm
who was aboard. In most cases relatives are afraid to report the
disappearances to Cuban authorities, Rivkind said.
   The canvas-covered raft of lashed-together inner tubes was found
Monday by a U.S. Coast Guard patrol 60 miles southeast of Miami.
   On board were the records of Luis Mourelo-Coll, 19, a lovesick
Cuban soldier who deserted the military to try to rejoin his
girlfriend, who had arrived in Miami in August. Mourelo-Coll also
had relatives in Florida.
   At first it was thought he might have been alone on the raft,
but on Friday tearful relatives of three others aboard contacted
the INS. Rivkind said he could not release names but that they were
14, 16 and 25 years old.
   Mourelo-Coll's flight had been carefully planned. Inside a
knapsack found with the raft were his Cuban identification,
military and junior high school records and five passport-size
photos.
   Also in the bag were unlabeled food cans, a tire pump,
antihistamine, a Cuban cigar, coins, a comb and a membership card
for a resort in Spain. There was also a list of names and addresses
in Florida, along with some notes that became illegible in the
water.
   The Coast Guard estimates Hurricane Gilbert must have struck the
raft with 40- to 50-mph winds after the four had been floating for
six to seven days.
   ``You can just picture this thing bouncing upside down in the
storm,'' Rivkind said. ``There is no way they could have survived
it.''
   Carmen Rodriguez, a cousin raised with Mourelo-Coll's mother,
had readied a spare room here after hearing in a Sept. 8 phone call
that her cousin had left Cuba. But she spoke to Mourelo-Coll's
grandmother in Cuba on Wednesday and learned that no one has heard
from him since he left.
   Rivkind said he will ask Radio Marti, the Florida-based radio
station beamed to Cuba, to issue more warnings about freedom floats.

   Gromyko, 79, retired from the presidency today, a day after he
stepped down as a member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo
during a hastily called meeting of the 300-member Communist Party
Central Committee.
   That meeting approved wide-scale changes in the party
bureaucracy.
   The election of Gorbachev allowed him to unify the top Communist
Party and government jobs, increasing his power to reform the
top-heavy Soviet political system.
   Moscow Communist Party leader Lev N. Zaikov said Gorbachev had
been endorsed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and the
Central Committee of the Communist Party.
   He was elected unanimously by the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet.

   Army troops in full combat gear moved
into two southern cities today to quell ethnic gun battles that
killed about 175 people and wounded at least 170 others, officials
said.
   The violence started Friday night in Hyderabad, 100 miles
northeast of Karachi, when marauding bands of native Sindhis
sprayed gunfire in about 30 neighborhoods of Mohajirs, Indian
Moslems who migrated to Pakistan after partition in 1947, witnesses
said.
   On hearing the news, Mohajirs in Karachi retaliated by setting
up roadblocks and firing on vehicles traveling from Sindhi
neighborhoods.
   In one case, Mohajir gunmen sprayed gunfire through the windows
and doors of a bus carrying Sindhi fish merchants, killing 12 of
about 20 on board, a witness said.
   Hospitals in Hyderabad said about 149 people, mostly Mohajirs,
were killed and 170 were wounded. Karachi hospitals confirmed a
total of 26 dead, mostly Sindhis.
   Ali Hassan, a local resident of Hyderabad, who saw the violence,
told The Associated Press by telephone, ``It was hell.''
   ``The markets were full of people ... when bullets were sprayed
from a moving car. There was panic and people started running for
shelter,'' he said.
   He said 10 to 15 cars and jeeps opened fire in about 30
different parts of the city at the same time.
   Hassan said the targets included public gatherings, a wedding,
movie houses and bus stops.
   He said sirens wailed as ambulances raced through the streets
ferrying the dead and wounded to hospitals.
   ``It was a very well-planned attack and executed with
perfection,'' Hassan said.
   Ismail Baloch, a 50-year fish merchant and wounded survivor of
the Karachi bus attack, said he and about 19 other Sindhis were
riding from their village east of the city to the main harbor when
armed Mohajirs stopped their bus near Karachi airport.
   ``They just started firing through windows and doors,'' he said
from his bed at the city's Jinnah Hospital.
   Authorities responded in both cities by calling in army troops
with machine-gun mounted jeeps and armored personnel carriers.
   Police clamped an indefinite curfew on Hyderabad, and calm was
reported restored by this morning as military patrolled the streets.
   In Karachi, officials put a curfew on six neighborhoods today,
but sporadic gunfire and rockthrowing were still being reported.
   Both Hyderabad and Karachi have been the scene of bloody ethnic
clashes in the past between Mojajirs and separaists who want Sind
province to be independent of Pakistan.
   Most of the dead in Hyderabad were Mohajirs, and casualties in
Karachi were Sindhi.
   The Hyderabad massacre was the worst in history for the city of
one million.
   The highest death toll ever reported in Hyderabad was 18 in
riots last July that followed an unsuccessful attempt by Sindhi
student radicals to assassinate Mohajir Mayor Aftab Sheikh.
   Mohajirs later published a list of alleged suspects, including
the president and six office bearers of the Jeay (Long Live) Sind
Students' Federation. All seven eventually were arrested and face
trial on murder and related charges.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday night's
attacks appeared to be the Sindhis' answer to those arrests.
   The most militant Sindhis are members of the Jeay Sindhi
Movement, which is campaigning for an independent state of
``Sindhudesh.''
   The Mohajirs, who dominate the province's cities, have formed
the Mohajir Quami Movement to press for official recognition as a
fifth nationality in addition to the Sindhis, Punjabis, Baluchis
and Pathans.
   Karachi, a hot, dusty metropolis of eight million, has a long
history of ethnic unrest which peaked with Sindhi-Pathan clashes in
late 1986 that killed more than 200.

   City commissioners voted 3-1 Thursday night to draft a permanent
ordinance that will be virtually identical to the 2-year-old
experimental ordinance that expires Nov. 11.
   The measure requires all-night convenience stores to have at
least two clerks on duty between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. It also requires
stores to install security cameras and to keep windows clear of
advertisements.
   Police Chief Wayland Clifton claimed the two-clerk requirement
was a major reason why convenience store robberies in the city
dropped from 61 in 1986 to 23 last year and eight so far this year.
   ``There's a lot less danger out there for people who work at
them and who go there to buy bread and milk,'' he said.
   But Gerald Felder, a lawyer representing the Retail Grocers
Association, argued that the two-clerk law was too expensive,
costing stores $18,000 to $25,000 a year. That expense may have
been a factor in the closing of five convenience stores, he said.
   ``The problem is the economic burden and the reasonableness of
the two-clerk requirement,'' Felder said. The idea is to make the
stores safer, but ``what you're doing is doubling the number of
potential victims,'' he said.
   Felder said robberies dropped after 1986 largely because of the
arrest of one or two active thieves and the effectiveness of other
requirements in the ordinance.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Governor's Estate Not Liable For Attica Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attica Correctional Facility inmates have
no claim against Nelson Rockefeller's estate for deaths that
occurred during a violent prison uprising in 1971, a federal judge
has ruled.
   A former state corrections commissioner, former state police
officials and New York National Guard officials remain defendants
in the $2 billion lawsuit.
   Although Rockefeller, then governor, gave state police the
go-ahead to retake the prison from rebelling inmates on Sept. 13,
1971, he can't be held legally responsible for the 39 deaths that
resulted, U.S. District Judge John Elfvin said Friday.
   Rockefeller had ``no personal involvement in unlawful or
indiscriminate use of force,'' Elfvin found. ``There is no question
regarding his role and its legality.''
   Attorneys representing 1,281 Attica inmates filed the lawsuit 14
years ago. They can appeal the ruling to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   Elfvin's ruling is seen as a major disappointment to the inmates
because none of the other defendants approach Rockefeller's wealth.
   The ruling is a victory for Rockefeller's heirs, who have been
prevented by the suit from inheriting an estate worth more than
$66.5 million. The former vice president and governor died of a
heart attack in 1979.
   Elizabeth Fink, lead attorney for the inmates, was out of her
Brooklyn office and unavailable for comment, her secretary said.
   Twenty-nine Attica prisoners and 10 people taken hostage by the
inmates were killed when authorities stormed the western New York
prison five days after an inmate revolt.
   Elfvin pointed out that he was only ruling on Rockefeller's
involvement in the retaking of the prison and not on the question
of whether improper force was used.
   After negotiations broke down, Rockefeller gave permission for
police to storm the prison but to use firearms only if their lives
or the lives of hostages were endangered. Other than that,
Rockefeller had no actual role in the planning of the assault,
Elfvin said.

   Tropical storm warnings have been issued throughout
the eastern Caribbean as Tropical Storm Isaac continued its
westward course from the Atlantic, forecasters say.
   But Isaac's top winds of 45 mph may not strengthen today as the
storm spins toward warm Caribbean waters, the National Hurricane
Center reported.
   At 6 a.m. EDT Saturday, Isaac was centered near latitude 12.0
north and longitude 58.8 west, or about 95 miles southeast of
Barbados, moving west-northwest at 14 mph.
   Tropical storm warnings were issued for the islands of Barbados,
the Grenadines, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Dominica and Martinique.
Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and its dependencies are under a tropical
storm watch.
   Isaac, which reached storm status Friday, was expected to drench
the Windward Islands today. Small craft in the warning areas were
advised to stay in port.
   Meanwhile, the former hurricane known as Helene evolved as
expected into a 600-mile-wide storm in the far North Atlantic.
   In its final advisory on Helene, the hurricane center reported
Friday that the storm was southwest of Reykjavik, Iceland with top
sustained winds near 70 mph.
   Tropical depressions become named storms when winds hit 39 mph
and hurricanes when winds reach 74 mph. Isaac is the ninth Atlantic
storm to reach named status this year.
   The six-month hurricane season started June 1 and ends Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan and Congress have approved a
defense budget which essentially freezes spending for a fourth
straight year and leaves the next president the task of trying to
forge a consensus on Star Wars and new land-based nuclear missiles.
   Congress late Friday gave voice-vote approval to a bill
appropriating most of the Pentagon budget authorized in separate
legislation passed earlier in the week.
   That authorization measure was signed Friday by Reagan, who had
vetoed a slightly different spending plan seven weeks ago because
he said it had too many restrictions on his Pentagon programs.
   The Pentagon budget calls for $300 billion in the fiscal year
which began today. That is a fourth consecutive year of either
freezing, or slightly reducing, the defense budget following four
years of large increases during Reagan's first term.
   America's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel will receive
a 4.1 percent pay increase in the budget.
   The bills give $4.1 billion to Reagan's Star Wars antimissile
plan, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative. Last
year's SDI budget was $3.9 billion and Reagan wanted $4.8 billion.
   The final bill stripped out Democratic-written restrictions that
would have limited Pentagon plans to develop an early-stage SDI
system for deployment in the next decade. Those limits were one of
the reasons Reagan vetoed the earlier legislation.
   The future of the five-year-old program will depend in part on
the Nov. 8 presidential election. Vice President George Bush is a
Star Wars backer, but his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, has
proposed cutting SDI back to a research program of about $1 billion
a year.
   The bills also leave it to the next administration to answer the
question of what to do about a successor to the Minuteman missile
as the heart of America's land-based nuclear deterent.
   The measure provides $250 million each for the single-warhead
Midgetman and a railroad-based version of the MX missile, plus an
additional $350 million for the MX that can't be spent until after
Feb. 15. The new president could seek a reallocation of that latter
total if he chooses.
   The administration has won approval for 50 of the 10-warhead MX
weapons, based in ground silos, and is pushing for 50 more to be
put aboard trains. Congressional Democrats generally have favored
the smaller Midgetman.
   The bills also include $320 million to increase the military
role in the anti-drug effort and order the Defense Department ot
provide more intelligence and tracking information to civilian law
enforcement agencies.

   The Supreme Soviet today elected Communist Party
chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev president to replace Andrei Gromyko. The
move greatly increased Gorbachev's power by unifying the top party
and government jobs.
   Gromyko retired from the presidency today, a day after stepping
down from the Politburo. The election of Gorbachev gives the
reform-minded leader a greater hand in his efforts to revamp the
top-heavy Soviet political system.
   In keeping with his goal of limiting the party's involvement in
day-to-day management, Gorbachev told the national parliament that
it was time for local government bodies, or soviets, to take on
more responsibility.
   ``The soviets must become the highest authority on their
territory and eliminate the shortcomings of stagnation,'' Gorbachev
said. ``The party will facilitate the enhancement of the role of
the soviets.''
   ``The soviets will take on their shoulders the major burden of
state work,'' the 57-year-old leader said. ``As the situation
changes, we must change accordingly.
   He was elected unanimously by the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet,
the nation's top governmental body.
   The Supreme Soviet also named Vladimir A. Kryuchkov head of the
KGB secret police. He replaced Viktor M. Chebrikov, who was named a
secretary of the party Central Committee in charge of legal and
judiciary affairs.
   Acting on Gorbachev's recommendation, the Supreme Soviet named
Anatoly Lukyanov vice president. He replaced Pyotor Demichev, who
was stripped of his candidate membership on the Politburo on Friday
at a meeting of the policy-making Central Committee.
   Lukyanov was named a candidate member of the Politburo.
   Gromyko, 79, a Communist Party and government stalwart from the
time of Stalin through the first several years of Gorbachev's
reforms, had been expected to step down following his resignation
from the Politburo on Friday.
   His five-minute farewell address was greeted with thunderous
applause.
   ``The star of socialism since October 1917 has constantly shined
and given light,'' he said. ``Thank you comrade deputies for the
trust you've granted me in the past and now. I have very deep
respect for it.''
   He became president in July 1985 after 28 years as foreign
minister.
   Friday's Central Committee meeting also approved wide-ranging
changes in the party bureaucracy destined to increase Gorbachev's
powers.
   Moscow' Communist Party leader, Lev N. Zaikov, said Gorbachev
was endorsed by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and by the
Central Committee.
   In an earlier report on the Supreme Soviet's meeting, Tass, the
official Soviet news agency, said ``a few personnel questions''
were on the agenda.
   On Friday, Gorbachev also obtained the resignations of three
Brezhnev-era holdovers _ full Politburo member Mikhail S.
Solomentsev, and candidate members Demichev and Vladimir Dolgikh.
He streamlined the apparatus and put staunch supporters in key
positions in the party, which exercises sole control over the
subordinate government bureaucracy.
   The decision to cut the number of government departments from
about 20 to six means hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the Soviet
Union's top party bureaucrats will lose their jobs.
   In other moves, Yegor K. Ligachev, considered the Kremlin's No.
2 leader, apparently was demoted in taking on the Central
Committee's agriculture portfolio. A member of the ruling Politburo
who earlier had been replaced as Communist Party chief for
ideology, Ligachev had widely been seen as a potential conservative
rival to the Soviet leader.
   Anatoly F. Dobrynin, 68, who served as ambassador to the United
States for 24 years before returning to Moscow to oversee foreign
relations in the Central Committee, retired as secretary of that
body.
   This week's meetings in Moscow were called so hastily that they
forced several Kremlin leaders to cut short trips abroad and gave
rise to speculation that Gorbachev might be trying to head off
opposition to his broad program of social and economic reforms.
   A senior Soviet political analyst said the changes clearly
strengthened Gorbachev's hand and would reduce tensions among
Soviet leaders.
   One new member was named Friday to the Politburo, Vadim A.
Medvedev. Medvedev, who was named to the Central Committee two
years ago, vaulted over non-voting Politburo status to become a
full member.
   Medvedev took over responsibility for ideology in the Central
Committee, Gorbachev adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev was assigned to
international policy, and Nikolai Slyunkov was given responsibility
for economic and social policy.
   Ligachev was transferred to overseeing agricultural policy, an
area of immense importance to the Soviet economy. However, that
position narrows his base in the Communist Party.

   Negotiators for Deere & Co. and the United
Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement today on a three-year
contract affecting more than 13,400 workers, company and union
spokesmen said.
   Robert Combs, spokesman for the farm equipment manufacturer,
announced the settlement shortly after 5 a.m. CDT, when pickets had
already been posted in front of some plants. No details of the pact
were immediately released.
   Talks between the two sides had continued in Moline, Ill., past
the union's midnight Friday strike deadline.
   The agreement covers employees at plants in Atlanta,
Minneapolis, Denver and smaller towns in Illinois and Iowa, Combs
said.
   UAW spokesman Karl Mantyla confirmed that the agreement had been
reached, but said he could not comment on details.
   ``It's subject to some ironing out of language,'' said Mantyla
after approximately 20 hours of talks. He said a schedule for a
ratification vote likely would be decided on during the weekend.
   Although pickets were reported after midnight at some Deere
plants, Mantyla said no strike had been called.
   ``No instructions were issued from here to walk out, but we have
not advised them not to, either. We don't know what the local
unions are doing,'' he said.
   Bruce Davis, a spokesman for UAW Local 94, said a strike over
local issues continues this morning at the Dubuque Deere plant,
despite the tentative agreement on a companywide contract. He would
not elaborate on the issues.
   The 5,377 workers at Deere's largest plant in Waterloo, Iowa,
delayed any strike action, said Jerry Niedert, first vice president
of the union local in Waterloo.
   The tentative agreement apparently averts a full-scale walkout
like the bitter strike in 1986-87 that ended after 163 days with
employees' acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions.
   In Bridgeton, Mo., negotiators for Caterpillar Inc. and the UAW
agreed earlier Friday to extend their contract indefinitely,
averting a midnight strike deadline and allowing the union to focus
its attention on Deere.
   The extension agreement between Peoria-based Caterpillar and the
UAW came just 12 hours before the current contract would have
expired and avoided a possible walkout by 17,500 Caterpillar
workers in five states.

   U.S. military experts returned today
from surveying an area in Laos where U.S. planes crashed during the
Indochina War and said their findings will be used to plan upcoming
site excavations.
   The United States, with help from the communist Laotian
government, is attempting to resolve the cases of 547 Americans
listed as missing in action, or MIA, in that Southeast Asian nation.
   Maj. Thomas J. Boyd, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command,
said eight technical experts carried out surveys in the Sepone area
of eastern Laos on Wednesday and Thursday.
   ``Findings from these activities will be evaluated in Washington
and (the Laotian capital of) Vientiane and be used to plan upcoming
excavations,'' a prepared statement read by Boyd said. He declined
to elaborate on the findings.
   ``We appreciate the fine cooperation the team has received and
look forward to increased joint activity with the Laos government
to resolve this important issue,'' the statement said.
   A similar U.S.-Vietnamese team is carrying out a 10-day field
investigation in Northern Vietnam, where 1,757 Americans are still
listed as MIA.
   The joint team is searching Vinh Phu and Lang Son provinces
north of Hanoi, collecting eyewitness account and other evidence of
what happened to seven U.S. servicemen lost in plane crashes during
the Vietnam war.
   The U.S. government also continues to investigate the
possibility that some Americans may still be alive in Indochina.
Vietnam and Laos have denied this, and Hanoi has often accused some
American congressmen and others of ``bad will'' for continuing to
accuse Hanoi of holding American captives.
   The American teams in Laos and Vietnam are from the Hawaii-based
U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and Army Central
Identification Laboratory.
   Before the team departed for Laos, Boyd said it would look at
crash sites and determine what kind of aircraft went down and how
they crashed.
   Losses in the Sepone area included airmen downed in missions to
cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail, used by communist North Vietnam to
infiltrate troops into U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
   The United States and Laos have now conducted four joint crash
site excavations or surveys.

   The health of ailing Emperor Hirohito took a turn
for the worse today when he lost a large amount of blood and
suffered a sharp drop in blood pressure, officials said.
   The monarch's blood pressure stayed down for 30 minutes, but
doctors gave him a large blood transfusion and his vital signs
stabilized, imperial officials said.
   Kenji Maeda, Imperial Household Agency spokesman, said the
emperor received a second transfusion later and was ``resting
peacefully'' in the evening.
   It was not possible to measure how much blood discharged from
the emperor's bowels, but it was ``a considerable amount'' and more
than in past days, said Maeda.
   News reports said a Red Cross vehicle with blood again entered
the Imperial Palace later today, but palace officials did not
immediately confirm that Hirohito had still another transfusion.
   Hirohito has been bedridden with intestinal hemorrhaging since
Sept. 19, when he vomited blood. News reports have said he has
intestinal cancer, but palace officials have neither confirmed nor
denied the reports.
   Earlier today, The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper,
said the emperor's overall condition was worsening and doctors
feared his internal bleeding had spread from the upper intestine to
other organs.
   The 87-year-old emperor, the world's longest reigning monarch,
is a symbol of the Japanese state, though he exercises no real
power. He has reigned since 1926.
   Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko were summoned to
the Imperial Palace after the emperor's episode today and stayed
for more than an hour.
   Prince Aya, Hirohito's second grandson, who arrived in Tokyo
today from London, where he is attending Oxford University, also
immediately visited the emperor.
   It was the ninth day in a row that Hirohito has been given
blood. He has been given a total of 9.4 pints of blood since Sept.
19, more than the total amount of blood in his body, news reports
said.
   Earlier today, the emperor ate food for the first time in nearly
two weeks. Hirohito ate five or six spoonfuls of a porridge, an
imperial agency official said.
   Newspapers reported today that palace doctors were worried about
the emperor's worsening jaundice. The reports said his hands and
feet were swollen because of a malfunctioning kidney and vitamin
deficiency.
   Maeda said Hirohito's temperature today was 99.5 Fahrenheit,
compared with his normal reading of about 95.9.
   Many autumn events have been canceled in Japan in deference to
Hirohito's health, including planned visits by overseas leaders.
   Newspapers said the government is considering postponing a visit
by South Korean President Roh Tae-woo scheduled for mid-November.
But a Foreign Ministry official denied the reports and said the
ministry was going ahead with preparations for the visit.
   It would be the first visit to Japan by Roh since he took office
in February.

<TEXT>
   President Mobutu Sese Seko and South
African President P.W. Botha held a historic summit meeting today
to discuss economic ties and a plan to end the civil war in Angola,
Zaire's southern neighbor.
   After two hours of talks at Mobutu's palace, the presidents told
reporters the Zairean leader had accepted Botha's invitation to
visit South Africa.
   No black African leader has visited South Africa since Botha
took power in 1978. No date was set for Mobutu's visit.
   ``Our relations are on a new path,'' Mobutu said, adding that
they talked ``frankly and in great depth.''Botha said he was
impressed with Mobutu's knowledge of southern Africa affairs and
called it ``a most successful morning.''
   Botha arrived in Mobutu's ancestral village near the Central
African Republic frontier to a red carpet but low-key reception.
The talks began shortly afterward and were to last through the day.
   In Kinshasa, the Zairean capital 700 miles southwest of
Gbadolite, where Botha's plane stopped to refuel, troops opened
fire on about 200 students demonstrating at the University of
Kinshasa against his visit.
   Witnesses said at least two students were injured, one hit in
the neck by a bullet and another hit in the leg. Both were taken to
the university clinic for treatment but their conditions were not
known.
   The meeting was Botha's first with Mobutu and his third summit
in black Africa during his 10 years in power _ all of them in the
past three weeks.
   After the morning meeting, Botha told reporters he and Mobutu
discussed the latest round of U.S.-mediated talks in the Congolese
capital of Brazzaville, aimed at a peace agreement between South
Africa and Angola.
   ``We discussed peace in Africa and in southern Africa
especially. We discussed the Angolan question, which is of vital
importance to all of us, and we discussed the South-West Africa,
Namibia problem which is being dealt with in the near future,''
Botha said.
   Both leaders said they would also discuss economic issues.
   Reporters and photographers, who witnessed the start of the
talks, said Mobutu welcomed Botha in French and Botha thanked
Mobutu for inviting him in a reply spoken in Afrikaans. The remarks
were translated by interpreters.
   Mobutu, in announcing the visit Friday, said South Africa had
asked for the meeting. The Zairean leader follows a firmly
pro-Western foreign policy.
   On Sept. 13, Botha met with President Joaquim Chissano of
Mozambique, a longtime adversary of South Africa. The next day he
visited President Kamuzu Banda of Malawi, the only African country
to maintain full diplomatic relations with Botha's white-controlled
government.
   One of Botha's longstanding foreign policy goals has been to
broaden ties with black Africa without having to make substantive
political concessions to the disenfranchised black majority in his
own country. There has been speculation about possible meetings
between Botha and other African leaders.
   Despite the lack of formal relations, Zaire and many other
African countries trade with South Africa and rely on its ports and
railroad lines for handling imports and exports.
   South African products, ranging from toothpaste to meat, are
sold in Zaire, and more than a third of Zaire's main export _
copper _ is routed through South Africa.
   Peace in Angola might lead to reopening of a rail line linking
southern Zaire to Angola's Atlantic Ocean port of Lobito, providing
a more efficient route for copper exports.
   The Brazzaville talks between South Africa and an Angolan-Cuban
delegation adjourned Thursday without agreement on the key issue of
a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in
Angola supporting the government.
   South Africa has offered to begin implementation on Nov. 1 of a
United Nations' plan for independence for South-West Africa, or
Namibia, if a Cuban withdrawal from Angola can be negotiated.
   Angola's Marxist government has accused Zaire of allowing the
UNITA rebel movement to operate from its territory, and there have
been repeated reports that U.S. military aid for UNITA is routed
through Zaire.

   About 300 aborigines marched through
downtown Sydney on Saturday to protest the deaths of aborigines in
custody.
   Warren Martens, spokesman for the Committee to Defend Black
Rights, said the march commemorated the death of aborigine John
Pat, who died in police custody five years ago.
   ``And it's also for all the others,'' Martens said, referring to
more than 100 aboriginal deaths in police cells and prisons over
the past decade.
   The deaths are being studied by the government-funded Muirhead
Royal Commission, headed by Justice James Muirhead.
   ``The royal commission is underfunded and the deaths are still
happening,'' Martens said.
   The demonstrators shouted: ``Black deaths, white hands, stop the
killings now!''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haiti's new military government has
retired a powerful army colonel who was indicted on U.S. drug
charges and was once considered a leading candidate for chief of
the armed forces.
   A few bursts of gunfire were heard around Port-au-Prince late
Friday, but there was no obvious sign today that Col. Jean-Claude
Paul was resisting the retirement. It was not known where he was.
   Several Haitian leaders hailed the retirement after it was
announced Friday. They said it showed that the 2-week-old
government was moving in the right direction.
   ``They are giving proof of their sincerity to oust
Duvalierists,'' said Louis Dejoie, a former presidential candidate.
He was referring to dictators Francois Duvalier and his son,
Jean-Claude, who ruled Haiti for 29 years until the younger
Duvalier was swept from power in a popular uprising in February
1986.
   Both Haitian and diplomatic sources said Paul's retirement could
eventually lead to renewed U.S. aid to Haiti, which was cut off
after a massacre of 34 people during elections last November in
this Caribbean nation.
   ``The situation is positive and encouraging,'' said Susan Clyde,
the U.S. Embassy spokeswoman. She said the embassy was told that
Paul had been replaced by his second-in-command, Lt. Col. Guy
Francois, an American-trained officer.
   The brief announcement on state television late Friday said only
that Paul was retired from the army and his post as commander of
the feared 700-man Dessalines Barracks in Port-au-Prince.
   The announcer said the decision was signed by Haiti's president,
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, and by the minister of defense and
interior, Col. Carl Dorsainvil. It did not say when the retirement
took effect.
   In March, Paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami
that accused him of conspiring to import cocaine into the United
States. Paul has denied any involvement.
   As head of the largest unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army, Paul
had been considered one of the most powerful figures in the
military. Haitian officials had said he could be named armed forces
chief shortly after Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy took power in a military
coup on Sept. 17.
   However, officials in Washington said such a move could hurt
U.S.-Haitian relations, and it never materialized.
   In June, Namphy had reassigned Paul to an administrative
position, but Paul refused and was backed by then-President Leslie
Manigat. Namphy ousted Manigat. Paul remained head of his battalion.
   Paul has been linked to the November massacre of voters at a
polling place and to the Tonton Macoutes, the hated personal
security forces of the Duvaliers.
   Told of Paul's retirement, one Western diplomat said, ``This
means that the American government will certainly reinitiate
assistance to Haiti, but will Jean-Claude Paul accept his
retirement?''
   A Haitian government official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he was surprised by the development, which he
called ``a door wide open'' to restoration of U.S. aid.
   The $70 million annual package, Haiti's largest source of
foreign aid, was ended after the election massacre.
   Dejoie said Friday, ``Now the guns have changed shoulders. I am
very pleased at the attitude of this government. The house-cleaning
is still going on in the army.''
   After rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Namphy two weeks ago,
they installed Avril as president under a new military government.
They said they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence and
institute democratic reforms, but the new rulers have set no date
for elections.
   The week after the coup, chaos ruled as soldiers around the
country rebelled against commanders and civilian mobs scoured the
country looking for people linked to the Duvalier regimes.
   About 10,000 mostly young people danced in the streets of
Port-au-Prince on Thursday in support of the soldiers' coup. It was
one of the biggest outpourings seen in the capital since
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France. Some of them
chanted ``Long Live Paul, Down With America.''

   Iran's leaders are rebuilding links with
the rest of the world while the country moves slowly toward ending
the war with Iraq _ and perhaps ending the long ordeal of Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   The leaders face opposition from hardliners who fear that ending
Iran's self-imposed isolation as it struggles to rebuild after
eight years of war will undermine the Islamic revolution.
   ``Iran is now at a crossroads,'' one Western analyst commented.
``It must either become more inward-looking or start looking
outward.
   ``The signs right now are that those advocating more openness
hold sway. But the next few months will be crucial either way.''
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati launched Iran's bridge-building campaign a year ago,
six months before Tehran accepted a United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire July 18 after a string of disastrous defeats.
   The Iranians fought the war virtually without allies, while Iraq
had the Soviet Union, France and most of the Arab world behind it.
   Rafsanjani and his supporters realized that Iran's ``No West, No
East'' strategy was counterproductive.
   He declared Aug. 21: ``Our postwar foreign policy will be more
open than our policy during the war. We must take this opportunity
to explain our aims and talk with the people of the world.''
   Reining in Iran's unruly Lebanese surrogates, the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and other Iranian-backed terrorist
factions is a key component of his strategy.
   He underlined that in a recent Tehran Radio broadcast in which
he stressed that Iran now ``is not thinking of exporting our
revolution through direct intervention or by force. The policy of
force is not a successful policy.''
   Groups linked to Hezbollah, the spearhead of the Islamic
revolution in Lebanon, are believed to hold most of the 17
foreigners, nine of them Americans, still missing in Lebanon.
   The longest held hostage, an American, is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Rafsanjani, considered the most powerful figure in Iran after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has told Britain that Iran will help
free British nationals held in Lebanon, including Church of England
envoy Terry Waite, in return for normalizing relations.
   On Friday, Britain announced it would resume full relations with
Iran, frozen last year after an Iranian diplomat was arrested for
shoplifting and a British diplomat was kidnapped and beaten in
Tehran.
   The Iranians have ranked Britain second only to the United
States as its main enemy in the West.
   Earlier last week, it was announced that Kuwait and Iran were
restoring full diplomatic relations.
   For West Germany, the links it maintained with Iran throughout
the war have already paid off.
   Three Germans kidnapped in Lebanon by Iranian-backed Shiite
Moslem extremists were freed after Tehran intervened. The last
French hostages were released in June, and France restored ties to
Iran.
   Iran also has restored relations with Canada and is improving
ties with Australia, New Zealand and the Soviet bloc.
   Bringing Hezbollah's wild men to heel will be no easy task.
Diplomatic sources reported that Rafsanjani was bitterly angry when
Lebanese militants hijacked a Kuwaiti airliner in April and
demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in Kuwait for bombings.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, one of the militant groups
in Lebanon, has warned that speculation about imminent releases is
``a mirage.'' But Rafsanjani's moves have raised hopes that other
captives will be freed.
   In recent weeks, government ministers and industrialists from a
score of countries, including West Germany, China, Denmark, Sweden,
Japan and South Korea, have visted Tehran.
   Many were lured by the prospect of lucrative contracts for
reconstruction projects on which some analysts estimate Iran will
have to spend at least $40 billion.
   Rafsanjani, who was involved in the secret arms-for-hostages
deal with the United States in 1985-86, is seen by many in the West
as the most pragmatic of the Tehran hierarchy who would like to
reopen a dialogue with the United States at some point.
   But it is unlikely that relations will be restored soon with the
United States, long reviled as ``the Great Satan.''
   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, who leads the hardliners opposing
Iran's open-door policy, declared Sept. 2 that speculation about a
U.S.-Iranian rapprochement was ``nothing but illusions.''
   He stressed: ``Considering the United States' acts against Iran,
the resumption of relations with Washington would be a betrayal of
the ideals of the revolution and those who have made sacrifices for
it.''
   And on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said any
U.S. settlement with Iran required an end to the Iran-Iraq war, an
end to terrorism and the release of hostages.
   ``There is no change in the situation as far as the United
States and Iran is concerned,'' he said.

   Those uneducated in the art of
NASAspeak might think LOX is eaten with bagels, a POD is home to a
pea, SMU is a college in Texas and MUM describes a pantomimist.
   Many of the journalists covering the flight of space shuttle
Discovery were new to the space agency's jargon and quickly became
frustrated trying to translate the language of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   For its part, NASA hummed along SOP.
   ``When we bring someone in to brief reporters, they speak in
their normal tongue. It becomes a quick way of communicating,''
said Pat Phillips, a NASA spokeswoman.
   ``At the end of their first mission, they (reporters) are pretty
conversant. It's like (at the end of a trip to Paris) being able to
order your meals in French and navigate around the city,'' she said.
   Phillips said there are about 20 to 30 ``major'' acronyms and
that ``once you learn these you are truly conversant.''
   Frequently at the shuttle briefings, NASA officials referred to
GSE, for ground support equipment, IMF, or in-flight maintenance,
TAL, trans-Atlantic abort landing sites, and TDRS, pronounced
tee-drus and standing for Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, the
$100 million communications satellite that was deployed on
Discovery's first day in orbit.
   NASA included a 4{-page glossary of acronyms in its press kit
for the Discovery flight, which drew 2,318 news media
representatives to the Kennedy Space Center to cover the first
shuttle launch since the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986.
   The acronyms in the press kit were culled from a 138-page
terminology guide given to space center employees. NASA
headquarters in Washington has a 305-page guide, with about 15
terms per page.
   At one pre-launch briefing, a frustrated reporter suggested
another acronym for the space agency's lexicon: AFE, meaning
acronyms for everything.
   Other reporters, including longtime space writers, applauded his
request that NASA briefers speak English.
   ``It's a problem,'' said Ron Kotulak, a Chicago Tribune reporter
who has covered space launches for more than 20 years. ``It's like
the priesthood using symbols to keep the outside out.''
   Hugh J. Martin, covering his first shuttle launch for the Tampa
Tribune, said some reporters were confused by NASA's explanation of
a damaged O-ring on a rocket being prepared for a future shuttle
flight.
   ``A large number of people didn't understand most of that
(explanation), but what they did understand was that there was a
cut in an O-ring,'' he said.
   It was a flawed O-ring joining segments of a booster rocket that
allowed superheated gas to burn through and spark the explosion
that destroyed Challenger.
   Martin said some newspapers reported the story incorrectly,
making the problem seem more critical than it actually was.
   ``In that case, NASA shot themselves in the foot,'' he said.
   Frank Merlino, NASA test director, said the jargon ``really
helps to condense conversations to the action. It's like slang. It
lets you get your point across quickly.''
   FYI, LOX stands for liquid oxygen, POD is the payload operations
director, SMU means speaker-microphone unit, and MUM is the mass
memory unit manager.

   As Emperor Hirohito clings to life, Japan has taken
up a vigil revealing affection and respect as well as disagreement
about the country's most ancient institution.
   Signs of the turning of an era seem to be everywhere, from weeks
of gloomy weather to the throngs who trudge under umbrellas to sign
registers urging recovery for the ailing 87-year-old monarch.
   About 3 million people have signed such registers nationwide,
but a minority complain that the emperor is an outdated figurehead
and that it's wrong for the authorities to encourage adulation.
   Last week, about 150 people from the Japan Citizen's League
marched in Tokyo to protest media portrayals that it said implies
the entire nation sympathizes with a man who they note is largely
powerless.
   But some nervousness is evident. Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita's Cabinet canceled important foreign trips, letting
lower-rankers handle official business abroad.
   Hirohito has held the Chrysanthemum Throne since Christmas Day
1926, and in a country where people put great store in acting
collectively, few remember how to act as the emperor's life seems
to be slipping away.
   The government decided last week to try to put a brake on the
cancellations of autumn festivals, fireworks displays, parades and
school sports fests.
   ``What is happening here must appear so queer to foreigners,''
the liberal-leaning Asahi Shimbun newspaper said Friday in an
editorial.
   When Hirohito assumed the throne, he was regarded as a living
god, and today's older Japanese were taught he was the focus of
personal obligation as well as a benevolent father of the Japanese
family.
   In legend, Japanese emperors descended from the Sun Goddess, and
the imperial family _ the oldest royal line in the world, with its
symbol the chrysanthemum _ dates to at least the eighth century.
With rare exceptions, emperors have been more like high priests of
Shintoism, the indigenous Japanese religion, than rulers with real
power.
   Hirohito bears all that mythic baggage as well as the mixed
legacy of his titular leadership in Japan's crushing defeat in
World War II and the morale-building that helped contribute to the
country's rise to economic prowess.
   He renounced his divinity in 1946, and the postwar Constitution,
largely imposed by U.S. occupation authorities, stripped him of all
government and political roles. It also required separation of
state and religion.
   Many young people who journeyed to the palace in central Tokyo
to pay tribute say they have been unexpectedly affected, as if a
beloved grandfather were ill.
   Retailers reported a run on rising-sun flags, with some asking
how to fly them at half-staff. Books about the emperor sold briskly.
   While about 80 percent of the Japanese say they support the
emperor system, a steady minority are uncomfortable with it.
   The Japan Citizen's League held its rally ``because we didn't
want foreign people, especially those in Asian countries, to think
the whole nation of Japan is sympathizing with the emperor and
worried about his illness,'' said Ryuzo Harada, secretary general
of the group.
   The Japan Communist Party kept silent after Hirohito's condition
turned serious on Sept. 19, but recently began running editorials
in its Akahata (Red Flag) newspaper reminding its 600,000 readers
of Hirohito's wartime role.
   Many Christians, a 1 percent minority in Japan, are worried that
glorification of the emperor could lead to renewed official links
with Shinto when Crown Prince Akihito, 54, is consecrated on the
throne.
   Shinto proponents, like author Hideake Kase, say the emperor is
a ``priest-king,'' not a head of state in the Western mold.
   ``We don't really need a head of state, but we need a head of
the family, or chief of the Japanese tribe,'' Kase said.
   Kase proposed the imperial family retire to Kyoto, the ancient
capital, away from the politics and business of Tokyo, and live out
of the public eye as a cultural institution.
   Some old soldiers who were exhorted during World War II to lay
down their lives for the emperor are among those disturbed by the
outpouring of sentiment. Seeing people kneeling at the Imperial
Palace is ``quite the same as what we saw during wartime,'' one
70-year-old former army officer said.
   The veteran was worried about a return to a ``spiritual
dictatorship'' like the 1930s and '40s, when Japanese soldiers were
told they were freeing Asian countries from Western colonization.
   Yoshio Oishi, professor emeritus at Kyoto University's law
faculty, found the sympathy understandable and apolitical.
   Hirohito is ``the symbol of the nation's consolidation through a
long history, and visiting the palace to pray for his recovery is
an expression of sympathetic feelings for the ailing man,'' Oishi
said.

   Here are some basic facts about Kosmos 1900,
the Soviet spy satellite expected to fall to earth soon, based on
information provided by the U.S. and Canadian governments.
   TYPE: Kosmos 1900 is a Soviet Rorsat ocean reconnaissance
satellite powered by a nuclear reactor, like two others which have
fallen to earth, Kosmos 954 in 1978 which dropped on remote
northwest Canada, and Kosmos 1402, which splashed into the Indian
Ocean in 1983.
   SIZE: Western experts estimate the weight of Kosmos 1900 at
about 2,200 pounds, and its dimensions about 20 feet by 7 feet.
   REACTOR: The satellite carries a nuclear reactor estimated to
weigh about 220 pounds and fueled by an estimated 110 pounds of
uranium U-235, much of which will have degraded to radioactive
isotopes.
   ODDS: The satellite has been falling slowly from orbit since
April, when the Soviets lost radio communications with it. The
chances are 66 percent that it will land in water, 33 percent on
land, 5 percent in the United States, 3 percent in Canada, and 1
percent onto a populated area.
   FALLOUT: If the reactor ejects on re-entry, as planned, the
radioactive material will turn to dust and settle slowly from the
atmosphere, posing little danger. If the reactor re-enters the
atmosphere protected by the satellite, the radioactive bits
probably would be about the same size as those from Kosmos 954.
Experts recovered 3,000 such pieces, most less than a millimeter
long, or .04 inches, with a few 500 to 700 milimeters long, 20 to
28 inches, according to Canadian officials.
   DANGER: Humans face danger from exposure to gamma radiation from
highly radioactive material. The larger the radioactive piece, the
greater the danger.
   PRECAUTIONS: Listen for official warnings carried by the media.
Stay indoors if authorities warn that the satellite will be falling
in your area. Do not touch or remain in the vicinity of strange
objects. If you come into contact with such objects, remove
contaminated clothes, place them in a plastic bag, shower and call
the authorities.
   REIMBURSEMENT: The Soviet government repaid Canada one half the
$3.5 million required to clean up material from Kosmos 954. Canada
did not seek compensation for environmental damages.

<HEAD>FBI Embarrassed Again In Hispanic Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's finding that the FBI discriminated
against its Hispanic agents is the second time in less than a year
that the bureau has been embarrassed over its treatment of minority
employees.
   Last November, black FBI agent Donald Rochon filed a lawsuit in
U.S. District Court accusing the bureau of racial harassment when
he was an agent in Omaha, Neb., and Chicago. The suit is pending.
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has already
ruled in favor of Rochon over those allegations concerning racial
mistreatment while he was in Omaha.
   Increasing the hiring of minorities has been a matter of rising
concern among the last two FBI directors, William Webster and
William Sessions.
   Webster, now CIA director, used to carry a card with him giving
the latest statistics on how many minority agents the FBI had.
   Recruitment of minorities and women was one of the first issues
Sessions addressed after becoming director last November. He has
said the FBI's makeup should reflect American society.
   Currently, there are 423 Hispanic agents and 412 black agents
among some 9,400. A total of 851 agents are women, including 37
Hispanics and 65 blacks.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton's conclusions Friday in the
Hispanics' suit address questions of advancement and treatment of
Hispanics within the bureau.
   Because the FBI has become a major participant in the war on
drugs it needs Spanish-speaking agents.
   Bunton agreed with the allegation that Hispanic agents often are
called off major cases to work on lesser cases to use their
Spanish-language ability, then were not given credit for their work
on the cases they were taken away from.
   Many other agents with training in law or accounting are placed
on a fast track of promotion up through the ranks, the judge said.
   Bunton said he understood the FBI needs Spanish-speaking agents
because of the war on drugs, but that the need for such agents does
not ``justify benefit and promotion systems which do not reward
Hispanic agents in a manner commensurate with their admitted
contribution to the bureau.''
   Problems of recruitment and promotion of minorities and women
were underscored last week with the resignation of Wayne G. Davis,
a black who is the special agent in charge of the FBI's
Philadelphia office.
   He is the highest-ranking black operating in the field for the
FBI and is the only black special agent in charge at any of the
bureau's 58 field offices across the country.
   At Washington headquarters, John Glover, who also is black, is
executive assistant director of administration.
   The FBI's office of Equal Employment Opportunity, which is one
of the many areas under Glover's control, came in for heavy
criticism from the judge in the ruling on the Hispanics' suit. The
EEO is in the administrative services division, which is headed by
assistant director Edwin Sharp.
   The Hispanics testified during the trial of their suit that they
did not trust the fairness of EEO procedures and that they feared
widespread retaliation or a negative stigma attaching to any
employee filing a grievance with EEO.
   At the trial, the FBI ``did not produce evidence that any
Hispanic EEO complaint had ever been found to be substantiated,''
said the judge.
   Every FBI office has two EEO counselors, with each being given
just two hours of training by the head of the employment
opportunity office and a packet of study materials.
   The EEO and the bureau have never performed any studies to
determine whether promotional processes are fair in method or in
outcome, or whether assignments, benefits, or training programs are
operated in an unbiased fashion, said the judge.
   The highest ranking female in the bureau is Carolyn Morris,
deputy assistant director in the technical services division at FBI
headquarters. She is black.

   Commander Frederick H. Hauck today
took time out from the Discovery crew's schedule to read a letter
from a New York teen-ager who said he was ``worried about the
future'' and assured the boy that America is ``back on track.''
   In the letter sent to Hauck before the launch, P.J. Morgan of
Brooklyn said:
   ``Dear Mr. Hauck, I'm a worried 14-year-old that is worried
about the future. I feel that some of America's future is riding on
you and your crew's shoulders. I give you all the inspiration I can
give you because your ride this fall means so much to me.''
   Hauck said he received the letter within the last year and a
half and called the boy just before the launch.
   ``I thought it was a particularly good letter and really sent
home to us how much the experiences we have here in space can have
an effect on the youngsters of America,'' Hauck said.
   Hauck said Morgan told him he had been inspired by his science
teacher at St. Mark's parochial school in Brooklyn ``because he had
some concerns about the future of America and whether we were still
capable of doing the things that make us a great country.''
   The mission commander thanked the boy for the letter and said he
hoped ``all the other youngsters out there not only in America but
in other parts of the world that may be watching and can see that
we are back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits
that will come in the future.''
   The mission commander read the letter just after astronaut John
M. Lounge had finished conducting a scientific experiment that was
designed by a high school student.
   NASA said P.J.'s parents had asked that their address and
telephone number not be given out.

   Authorities thought it was a radioactive Soviet
satellite, but the glittering, smoking sphere that closed the
Paris-Lille superhighway for nearly two hours turned out to be
carnival equipment.
   The 6-foot aluminum sphere fell off a carnival truck Friday
night, and the electrical workings inside apparently caught fire
from the impact, officials said.
   The Soviet nuclear-powered Cosmos 1900 satellite remained in
earth orbit, but was expected to fall into the atmosphere sometime
this week. French space specialists say the chances it will fall on
French territory are about one in a thousand.
   At about 9 p.m. Friday, a motorist on the highway near Peronne,
about 85 miles north of Paris, saw the smoking, shiny debris and
alerted police.
   Dozens of gendarmes, firemen and civil defense workers were
called out to divert traffic around the area and establish a
security perimeter.
   The superhighway was reopened before 11 p.m.

<HEAD>Mulroney Calls Federal Elections Nov. 21; Free-Trade On The Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, placing his
free-trade agreement with the United States on the line and
inviting ``the people to judge us,'' today called a federal
election for Nov. 21.
   Speaking to reporters outside Government House, where Governor
General Jeanne Sauve had just dissolved Parliament, Mulroney
promised the Progressive Conservatives will offer ``an agenda of
confidence for Canada,'' with the free-trade pact ``very much a
centrepiece'' of his party's campaign.
   He pointed to the creation of jobs in Canada _ more than 1,000
each day he has been in power, he said. He also promised increased
social aid to those who need it, a national commitment to ``a
pollution-free Canada,'' and an agreement with the United States to
cut emissions believed to cause acid rain.
   The election call came two days after a poll indicating that the
Conservatives have a substantial lead over the main opposition
Liberal Party and the socialist New Democratic Party.
   Despite presiding over a healthy economy and negotiating an
accord to bring Quebec back into the Constitution, Mulroney has
struggled with a credibility problem referred to in the press as
the ``sleaze factor.'' He has lost eight Cabinet members in
scandals ranging from tainted tuna to criminal charges.
   The Democrats and Liberals oppose the free-trade deal, which
would eliminate tariffs over 10 years between the United States and
Canada and dismantle barriers to investment and competition.
   The agreement has been blocked in the unelected Senate by the
Liberal majority. Liberal Party leader John Turner has promised the
Senate blockade will be lifted if Mulroney wins a majority in the
election for the 295 seats in the House the Commons, which has
approved the free-trade agreement.
   The deal must be passed by the Senate to become law.
   Turner and New Deomcratic Party leader Ed Broadbent claim the
free-trade agreement jeopardizes Canadian sovereignty.
   When the Commons was dissolved, the Conservatives held 204
seats, the Liberals had 38, the Democrats 32, independents 3,
independent Liberals 1, and four seats were vacant. Because of
redistribution, 13 seats will be added to the Commons for the
November election.
   Mulroney, 49, hopes the Conservatives will be the first majority
government returned with a majority since the Liberals under Louis
St. Laurent in 1953.
   Although the constitution allowed Mulroney to serve a five-year
term, he chose to follow the lead of other Candadian prime
ministers and call the election after governing about four years.
   He began his fourth year in office on Sept. 17.
   An Angus Reid poll released Thursday indicated Mulroney's party
had support from 40 percent of respondents, compared with 31
percent for the New Democratic Party and 26 percent for the
Liberals.
   Mulroney, who became leader of his party in 1983 and scored a
landslide victory a year later, had been waiting for such
encouraging signs before calling an election.
   If he wins, the world's two largest trading partners will
proceed with plans to create a North American free trade zone on
Jan. 1.
   If he loses, both the main opposition Liberal Party and the
socialist New Democratic Party say they will tear up the complex
trade deal, hailed by President Reagan as ``only a beginning'' in a
global free flow of trade.

   Discovery was ``operating just
super'' today as its five astronauts photographed landmarks on
Earth, melted titanium, and read a letter of inspiration from a
Brooklyn high school student.
   Only a few minor problems had arisen as the first
post-Challenger flight reached its midpoint, and a flight director
at Mission Control Center in Houston reported the five crewmen were
``having a ball.''
   During a television program from 184 miles up, mission
specialist John M. Lounge sent electrical heat through four glass
tubes containing titanium wires to determine if heating the metal
in weightlessness could strengthen it.
   The experiment, proposed by Lloyd Bruce, a senior at the
University of Missouri, was selected from thousands submitted to
NASA in its student involvement program. Bruce, a high school
student at the time he made the proposal, watched on TV at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston and will analyze test results after
Discovery returns.
   Following the experiment, commander Frederick H. Hauck appeared
on the screen and read a letter he had received several months ago
from Phillip J. Morgan, a Brooklyn high school student who was 14
at the time he wrote it. He said the letter was especially
meaningful to his crew.
   The letter read in part: ``I feel that some of America's future
is riding on you and your crew's shoulder. I give you all the
inspiration I can give you because your ride this fall means so
much to me.''
   Hauck said he had talked with Phillip and his mother by phone
and that the youth told him he had some ``concerns about the future
of America and whether we are still capable the things that make us
a great country.''
   ``I thought it was a particularly good letter and really sent
home to us how much the experiences we have here in space can have
an effect on the youngsters of America,'' Hauck said.
   The astronauts read a teletype message radioed to them overnight
congratulating them for ``another super job yesterday,'' and giving
baseball scores and the news of the shakeup in the Soviet
government.
   The message also said, without explanation, there was ``no
update on the sinks'' at pilot Richard O. Covey's house and said
the wives of the crew ``send their greetings and report they
represented you well at the Outpost.''
   The Outpost is a bar that is a favorite of the astronauts near
the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   The astronauts were very quiet in the hours after wakeup today
as they went about the business of experiments and spacecraft
checks.
   They photographed a crater in Oman, forest preserves in India,
an Indonesian volcano chain and a lake in Egypt. Pictures taken of
the Earth's horizon at sunrise and sunset could help develop better
horizon sensors for satellites.
   The astronauts were awakened promptly at 4:37 a.m. EDT, this
time by a mock version of a Beach Boys tune, with lyrics saying:
   ``'Round, 'round. We orbit 'round. And we're going to town.
   ``Well, we're racking up the miles with a whole lot of power.
We're going seventeen thousand, five hundred an hour.''
   The loud tune piped up by Mission Control in Houston prompted
crew member George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson to radio back, ``Don't stop.
Good morning, Houston. Great tune.''
   Nelson and his four crewmates _ Hauck, Covey, and mission
specialists Lounge and David C. Hilmers _ then began about an hour
of exercising before having breakfast and setting about their
chores for the day.
   Television pictures from space showed the astronauts obviously
pleased as they floated about the cabin in weightlessness. But they
also were businesslike as they conducted a series of experiments
and tested spacecraft systems, many of them new and the rest unused
for more than 32 months.
   Today's planned experiments included growing crystals in
weightlessness, photographing the horizon at sunrise and sunset and
testing an infrared communications system.
   The communications test called for the astronauts to try to talk
with one another using the kind of invisible infrared light that
remotely controls home television sets. They were to use their
regular communications headsets to convey messages by these
lightwaves through a series of transmitters and receivers.
   One use of such a system would be as a secure communications
loop inside an orbiting spacecraft. Unlike radio frequency signals,
infrared signals will not pass through a shuttle's windows.
   Several classified military flights are planned on the shuttle
in coming years.
   Later today, Hauck was to don one of the pressure suits the
astronauts will wear during the descent to Earth on Monday in case
they have to make an emergency bailout while trying to land at
Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Nelson was to practice installing a telescoping pole in the
cabin. For an emergency bailout the crew would blow out the cabin
hatch, extend the pole outside and slide down it to clear the
spaceship wing before opening parachutes.
   The practice was to see how long the preparations take in
weightlessness.
   The escape system would be of use only if the shuttle were in
stable, gliding flight. It was added after Challenger exploded 32
months ago, killing seven astronauts, but would not have helped
then because the explosion occurred too early into the launch.
   Flight director J. Milton Heflin attributed the astronauts'
relative silence Friday to the many new orbiter systems the crew is
checking. A total of 210 were introduced following the Challenger
explosion.
   An antenna became stuck and had to be remotely stowed back in
the cargo bay by radio control, reducing the number of television
broadcasts from space. When the same thing happened on a flight
four years ago, the antenna was repaired by an astronaut during a
spacewalk.
   The crew also had to contend for the first two days with a cabin
temperature of 84 degrees because of a lingering malfunction in a
cooling system, but the problem was cleared up by today.
   ``The orbiter is great, the systems on board the orbiter are
doing quite well ... it's operating just super,'' Heflin said
Friday.
   Back at Cape Canaveral, the redesigned booster rockets that
powered Discovery toward orbit were towed into port, and looked
``absolutely clean,'' said John Thomas, the NASA engineer who
directed their redesign.

<HEAD>Air Force Secretary Refuses to Intervene on Behalf of Disenrolled
Cadet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cadet who lost part of a leg in
a traffic accident has lost his bid to stay in the Air Force
Academy in spite of his handicap.
   A Pentagon rule calls for ``disenrollment'' of any service
academy cadet who loses all or part of a limb, and Air Force
Secretary Edward C. Aldridge approved that action Friday for Cadet
Third Class Dan Korslund.
   Aldridge had been pressured by two senators, several advocates
for the disabled and an organization of amputee athletes pushing
for Korslund, who would have been in his sophomore year this fall.
   Aldridge announced his decision in a letter to Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., who said he would ask President Reagan to
consider the case.
   Korslund, 20, lost part of his right leg in June while helping a
friend start a stalled car on Interstate 25 near the academy
grounds.
   At the time of the accident Korslund had been confined to the
academy grounds in a disciplinary matter and technically was absent
without leave, The Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph quoted
sources as saying.
   Armstrong, who had tried to keep Korslund in the academy, called
Aldridge's decision ``a great mistake.''
   In addition to the Pentagon rule, Aldridge said it would be a
waste of taxpayers' money to send Korslund to school when there is
no possibility he would be allowed to serve in the Air Force.
Military officials estimate it costs about $200,000 to send a cadet
through a service academy.
   An Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon said current policy does
allows seniors who become medically disabled in their final
semester to graduate.
   Academy spokesman Will Ketterson said Korslund was advised of
the decision Friday at a Veterans Administration hospital in
Seattle, near his home in Tacoma, where he was transferred earlier
in the week.
   A man answering the telephone at the VA hospital said Korslund
was not available for comment and had in fact left the hospital.
   ``He has been discharged and that's all I'm allowed to say,''
said the man, who refused to give his name.

<HEAD>High-Profile Police Presence Reported On Anniversary of Tibet
Riots</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rifle-toting police patrolled the streets and
monasteries of Tibet's capital Saturday on the first anniversary of
anti-Chinese protests that left at least 14 people dead.
   Foreign travelers contacted in the remote Himalayan region
reported no incidents as about 200 police guarded Lhasa's holy
Jokhang Temple, the main site of the bloody Oct. 1, 1987 riots.
   Michael Ruh of West Germany said police carrying rifles walked
continuously on the square in front of the temple and on the
Lingkor, the pilgrim's path around the Jokhang.
   ``You can see them on the rooftops with binoculars,'' Ruh added.
   The protests last year on China's Oct. 1 National Day were led
by Buddhist monks loyal to Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, and seeking an end to Chinese rule over Tibet.
   An Australian traveler said he was detained briefly by Tibetan
police while walking near the Jokhang on Friday night. ``They
pushed us around and were a little hostile at first ... but they
gradually calmed down and became Tibetan again,'' said the man, who
identified himself only as Jeremy.
   Describing police as ``ready and jumpy ... but hoping that
nothing will happen,'' the Australian said he and a friend counted
33 trucks carrying about 40 police each patrolling the city.
   Travelers were told by security officers they would be punished
if they took part in protests and warned them to stay away from the
Jokhang and the nearby Barkhor market.
   Ruh said authorities closed a second-floor cafe overlooking the
Jokhang that is frequented by travelers. An 11:30 p.m. curfew has
been in effect since last Sunday, he said.
   Chinese leaders in recent days have stressed Tibet will never be
given independence or semi-independence and warned that separatists
will be dealt with harshly.
   Asian diplomats say Chinese military forces around Lhasa have
been increased, and travelers to Lhasa report police surveillance
of monasteries has increased.
   China has proposed direct talks with the Dalai Lama, with the
stipulation that he must abandon any claims to Tibetan independence.
   The Dalai Lama fled to exile in India after a failed uprising
against the Chinese military in 1959.
   Lastt June, the Dalai Lama proposed Tibet be given domestic
autonomy while China retain control over the region's military and
foreign affairs. The plan was rejected by Beijing.

<HEAD>Study Urges Next President To Boost Spending For Non-Nuclear
Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next U.S. president should increase
spending for non-nuclear weapons and meet military budgets by
cancelling new weapons instead of cutting training, a bipartisan
group of legislators recommended Saturday.
   ``Like a sentry on a long, uneventful watch when things seem so
quiet, our current defense policy relies too heavily on complacent
assumptions that all is well,'' said the study.
   ``We seem to believe that our `big guns' _ our strategic nuclear
missiles, our proposed space weapons _ will somehow save us from
all problems, all foes,'' it warned.
   The report was released by the Congressional Military Reform
Caucus, a 7-year-old bipartisan group of senators and House members
who have pushed for improvements in U.S. defenses. The group is
chaired by Reps. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., and Tom Ridge, R-Pa.
   The study called for shifting money from long-range nuclear
weapons and Star Wars anti-missile research into conventional
forces, such as armor and tanks. No figures or force levels were
recommended.
   The report also noted that budget restrictions will be
reductions in future military spending plans. The Pentagon budget
has been essentially frozen for the past four years, after four
years of large increases during President Reagan's first term.
   Whoever succeeds Reagan _ Republican George Bush or Democrat
Michael Dukakis _ will have to make difficult choices and he should
cancel future weapons rather than cutting back on basics such as
training and ammunition, the study said.
   In addition, it said, the U.S. military should go to a ``back to
basics'' strategic which decreases dependence on short-range atomic
weapons and high-technology systems and which relies more on
defenses such as better armor.
   ``In some areas of Europe, we stockpile only nine days of
ammunition, yet last year we allocated some $31 billion to
strategic nuclear weapons,'' it said.
   ``We have spent $20 billion on MX missiles designed to fly 5,000
miles and hit within 100 yards of their targets, but we do not have
in our arsenal an infantry weapon that can fly 500 yards and stop a
modern Soviet tank,'' the study added.
   Part of the report focused on the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, or NATO, and its ability to protect Western Europe
from attack by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.
   While noting that there is no conclusive way to assess NATO's
capability versus the Warsaw Pact, the study called for more
non-nuclear weapons.
   ``There is a growing sense in Congress that we must'' rely more
on conventional weapons, the study said.
   While not endorsing either Bush or Dukakis, the warning to beef
up spending on conventional weapons echoes calls by Dukakis.
   The Soviets have a numerical advantage in tanks which has been
estimated at three to one. The report called for a system of
anti-tank barriers in West Germany, which would be the most likely
site for a Soviet conventional attack on NATO.
   ``The problems with building barriers have been political, not
military,'' the study said. ``They have been resisted by the West
Germans for fear that would reinforce the partitioning of their
country.''
   ``But this resistance could be overcome, particularly if seen as
part of an effort to reduce the level of both nuclear and
conventional forces,'' it said.

<HEAD>Bush Holds Electoral College Edge in White House Stretch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush holds an Electoral College edge
over Michael Dukakis entering the final five weeks of the White
House campaign, but tight races from Connecticut to California
portend a volatile finish, according to an Associated Press survey
of the 50 states.
   Democratic concern over Dukakis' candidacy is evident, although
party officials say there is ample time for the Massachusetts
governor to triumph.
   ``It's not over yet by any stretch of the imagination,'' said
Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas. ``But he's got to go on
the offensive'' against Bush's charges that Dukakis is too liberal.
   Republicans say the vice president has hit his stride and the
issues are working in his favor. ``Dukakis won the primary on his
Massachusetts miracle claim, but now people are remembering what
government, the economy, was under Jimmy Carter,'' said Tony
Feather, executive director of the Republican Party in Missouri,
where the two candidates are rated even.
   Nationwide public opinion surveys indicate a narrow advantage
for Bush, although the same surveys show enough undecided and
loosely committed voters to alter the outcome of the race.
   Adding to the uncertainty is a campaign calendar that includes a
debate next Wednesday between vice presidential candidates Dan
Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen, followed by a return engagement between
Dukakis and Bush in mid-October. After that comes a three-week
sprint to the finish line punctuated by a barrage of television
commercials.
   ``A lot of people are not happy with either candidate and the
last week or two they'll decide what to do,'' said Georgia's Lt.
Gov. Zell Miller, a Democrat.
   Despite steady late-summer advances by Bush _ and Democratic
talk of a Dukakis rebound _ neither man has been able to seize an
advantage in a string of states where the election will be decided.
The list includes Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey,
Connecticut, California and others, totaling over 150 electoral
votes.
   It takes 270 electoral votes to win the White House, and the
only Democrat to make it in the last five elections was a
Southerner, Carter.
   According to an AP survey of political leaders, independent
analysts and public opinion polls in all 50 states, Bush appears to
be solidifying much of the traditional Republican base across the
South and Rocky Mountain West. He is rated the solid leader in
Florida with its 21 Electoral College votes and seems to be opening
a little daylight between himself and the Democrats in Texas,
although Dukakis is waging an intensive campaign in running mate
Bentsen's home state.
   Border states such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee
remain competitive.
   Dukakis is given the edge in several traditional Democratic
Party strongholds, including New York and its 36 electoral votes,
but has not been as successful as Bush in cementing his own
political base.
   The AP survey turned up frequent expressions of concern among
Democrats over the shape of Dukakis' campaign, tempered with hope
that he may be on the rebound after suffering a political free-fall
earlier in the campaign.
   ``I think we have turned around what I perceived was a slide
here,'' said Ohio's Democratic chairman, Jim Ruvolo.
   In Maryland, a traditional Democratic state where the polls show
a close race, the party's vice chairman, John Willis, said, ``I
would like to be further ahead. I would like to be 20 points ahead
but that's unrealistic.''
   Republicans who were worried when Bush was down in the polls
last summer are smiling now that he is showing surprising strength
in states such as New York, Pennsylvania and Iowa that figured to
be among his weakest.
   ``It looks like a dead heat in states like New York and
Massachusetts and a really strong Democratic candidate should be
considerably ahead in states like those at this point,'' said
Robert S. Poliner, chairman of the Republican Party in Connecticut.
Dukakis remains the favorite in both Massachusetts and New York,
the AP survey showed.
   Senior campaign aides to both men offer different perspectives.
   Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, said Bush's Electoral
College base of ``210 to 220 votes'' is intact, freeing the vice
president to campaign intensively in swing states with occasional
forays into Democratic strongholds.
   Dukakis aides say the race will be won or lost in the large
number of battleground states where neither candidate has the edge.
   ``The race has tightened up and it's competitive and a lot of
people haven't made up their minds,'' said Dukakis communications
director Leslie Dach. ``The states that we need to win this race
are very competitive.
   The Electoral College lineup looks like this:
   _ Bush's strongest region is probably the South, where he leads
almost everywhere. Bentsen's presence on the ticket guarantees a
close race in Texas, however, and Dukakis has strong support in
North Carolina and border states such as Arkansas, Kentucky and
Tennessee.
   _ California and Washington on the West Coast are rated as
tossups, with Dukakis given the edge in Oregon. Bush appears to
have firmed up support in traditional Republican states such as
Utah, Idaho and Wyoming, but the Dukakis campaign says it has
strength in New Mexico and Montana.
   _ Farm states such as Kansas and Nebraska are leaning to Bush,
while Dukakis harbors hopes for the Dakotas. The Democrat is
favored in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota in the upper Midwest.
Dukakis has no hopes for Quayle's home state of Indiana. He seems
to have a slight edge in Illinois, but Democrats concede he is
probably slightly behind in Ohio and Missouri. Republicans see a
narrow advantage in Michigan.
   _ The Northeast is Dukakis' strongest region, and despite
closer-than-expected public polls, he is regarded as the likely
winner at home in Massachusetts as well as New York, Rhode Island,
Maryland and West Virginia. Vermont and Maine appear to be close,
and New Hampshire is Bush territory.

   A race is on between illegal artifact
hunters grabbing valuable Indian tools exposed by a receding lake
and archaeologists who need the relics to piece together the puzzle
of a prehistoric culture.
   Despite laws making it illegal to collect artifacts on federal
land, the archaeologists are losing.
   ``It's like checking a book out of the library and never
bringing it back for anyone else to read,'' C. Melvin Aikens, a
professor of anthropology at the University of Oregon, said of the
loss of the artifacts. ``It's a tragedy.''
   For thousands of years, ancestors of the Burns Paiute Tribe went
to the marshes of Malheur Lake in the high desert of southeastern
Oregon to hunt and harvest edible seeds.
   They left behind exquisitely crafted points for their lances and
arrows made out of obsidian, a dark volcanic glass; chips of chert,
a type of rock, used to skin the muskrat they trapped in the
bullrushes; and stones used to grind the seed.
   For the past four years, their lakeside camps have been covered
by the highest water in recorded history on Malheur Lake, the focus
of a big basin with no outlet.
   The water rose nearly eight feet higher than normal, tripling
the lake in size to more than 180,000 acres and flooding ranches,
roads, railroad tracks and a school.
   The high water allowed waves to scour the land, washing away
three to four feet of soil in places, and now that drought has
allowed evaporation to catch up and the lake is receding, thousands
of years worth of artifacts are being revealed.
   Graves also are being exposed.
   ``There is an old Indian legend about people living around the
lake offended one of the spirits,'' said Dale Hile, tribal manager
of the Burns Paiutes. ``A shaman cast a spell and a plague killed
off a lot of people years and years ago. The indication is there
probably could be up to a hundred gravesites.
   ``We want to get in and deal with all this before the vegetation
takes over, then the pot-hunters take the rest.''
   Some newly exposed islands look as if someone scattered museum
displays on the ground. Besides Stone Age Indian artifacts, there
also are leavings of the homesteaders who drove them out.
   ``These are what you call diagnostic artifacts,'' said George
Constantino, manager of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, as he
stooped to examine an eight-inch obsidian point. ``When you have
those pieces, it's like you have the corners of the jigsaw puzzle.
   ``These are just national-quality sites, irreplacable sites. But
they are just going away, one piece at a time.''
   Constantino has just himself and an assistant to patrol the 150
miles of shoreline. He hopes to get another helper and periodic
stakeouts by a federal strike team. Last summer, he cited three
people carrying shovels who had hidden their truck in the brush,
but the race still is being lost.
   ``Thirteen days after we looked at this one island, we had an
archaeological crew there and someone had beat us to it,''
Constantino said. ``Of the nine sites, all but two have been
previously collected.''
   Aikens said preserving the archaeological record is much more
than just scooping up arrowheads.
   ``We need to know where they were found, what else was with
it,'' he said. ``If you don't know the age of the materials and
where they came from, there is no potential to reconstruct a
culture.''
   ``It's the kind of thing that has to be done judiciously over
the long haul,'' he said.
   An archaeological team that has spent the summer on a dig in the
nearby Diamond Valley will soon begin a three-week, $10,000 survey
of sites on the lake and collect and catalog pieces on the surface
that the illegal hunters haven't gotten yet.
   But artifact hunters have become so bold that some recently
looted the Diamond Valley dig after the archaeologists stopped for
the day, Constantino said.
   ``It's everthing from grandpa and grandma to the
professionals,'' Constantino said. ``The best ones are just as
covert as illegal drug traffickers.
   ``As much as everyone wants to pick up that arrowhead and put it
in their pocket, they are taking information away from the
future,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bentsen, Quayle Often on Same Side in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sens. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Dan Quayle of
Indiana have voted together for the Reagan tax cuts, military aid
to the Contras, money for the MX missile and the death penalty for
drug-related murders.
   On such issues as defense and capital punishment, in fact,
Bentsen's voting record is at odds not with Quayle, but with his
own running mate, Michael Dukakis. Quayle, on the other hand, has
little apparent quarrel with any of George Bush's positions.
   Still, the two vice presidential candidates have often found
themselves at loggerheads, including a recent battle over whether
to give workers 60 days' notice of plant closings.
   As they gird for their nationally televised debate in Omaha,
Neb., Wednesday night, each will be probing the other's record for
points of attack.
   For the younger, less experienced Republican, whose credentials
the Democrats have ridiculed, the debate may also be an opportunity
to emphasize those issues where he, Bush and Bentsen are of one
mind _ and Dukakis is of another.
   But there will also be ample opportunity for Bentsen to point
out stark differences between his and Quayle's voting records on
social programs, labor issues, civil rights, education, energy and
other matters.
   Bentsen, 67, has served nearly 24 years in Congress, twice as
long as his 41-year-old rival, and the Texan is near the pinnacle
of the Senate power structure as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   In this year alone, Bentsen has been the Democrats' point man in
successful efforts to enact major legislation on trade,
catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and the nation's
welfare programs.
   A defense-minded Texas Tory, Bentsen was pushing for tax cuts _
including a lower capital gains tax _ back in the late 1970s during
the Carter administratio, when he chaired the Joint Economic
Committee.
   Quayle is a back-bench Republican who sits on the Armed
Services, Budget and Labor and Human Services committees. His main
legislative accomplishment during eight years in the Senate was the
Job Training Partnership Act of 1983.
   He made that legislative effort, with support from a liberal
Democrat, Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, over the
reservations of the Reagan administration.
   Quayle has been a stalwart supporter of the Strategic Defense
Initiative. But Bentsen also supports it. Like Bentsen, Quayle
voted in 1986 to override Reagan's veto of a bill imposing
sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime.
   On the campaign trail, Quayle almost never mentions Bentsen,
while constantly pillorying Dukakis as weak on defense and as
merely another ``inexperienced liberal governor'' like Jimmy
Carter, the last Democrat to occupy the White House.
   But as a freshman member of the House in 1977, Quayle supported
Carter's plan to kill the B-1 bomber. In the pivotal vote, Quayle
and seven other Republicans sided with the Democrats on a 202-199
showdown on the issue. Reagan revived the B-1 when he took office,
and all 100 bombers now have been built.
   Quayle voted to sustain Reagan's veto this year of the Civil
Rights Restoration Act; Bentsen voted for the successful override.
   On the plant closing notification law, Quayle was the leading
opponent and Bentsen the leading proponent. Quayle argued it would
impose ``a legislative straitjacket on industry'' and ``impede our
capacity to compete in world markets.''
   Bentsen and Quayle debated the issue last April 22 on public
television's MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour. Reagan later vetoed the trade
bill because it contained the 60-day notice provision.
   But Bentsen and fellow Democrats came back with separate trade
and plant closing notification bills. Reagan eventually signed the
trade bill and let the plant closing notification measure become
law without his signature.
   Bentsen and Quayle were on opposite sides of this year's effort
in Congress to raise the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage for the first
time since 1981.
   Quayle, after initially resisting any increase, supported a
compromise including a sub-minimum training wage for teen-agers.
Quayle says he now supports a $4 minimum wage, but says what the
working poor really need is better training and education, not a
higher minimum wage.
   There will be no increase in the minimum wage this year,
however. Faced with the threat of a Republican filibuster and
unwilling to accept a sub-minimum wage for teens, Senate Democrats
recently dropped efforts to raise the minimum to $4.55.
   Bentsen votes most of the time with the Democratic majority, but
he has broken ranks to support Reagan requests on Contra aid, SDI
and the MX mobile missile.
   Quayle was an outspoken opponent of legislation to ban the use
of lie detectors in the workplace, and he complained when the White
House dropped its opposition last March that it had ``caved like a
house of cards.'' Bentsen supported the bill.
   Bentsen and Quayle were on opposite sides of the Senate's May 9,
1985 vote for a one-year budget freeze _ including Social Security
_ that passed 50-49, with Bush casting the tie-breaker. But while
Bentsen voted against a freeze on that occasion, he voted twice in
1984 and 1985 for other freeze proposals that would have delayed
Social Security cost-of-living increases for six or 12 months.
   On other issues:
   _Bentsen has voted in favor of prayer in public schools and for
a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget _ both of which
are opposed by Dukakis and supported by Bush and Quayle.
   _Bentsen, the Texan, also favors an oil import fee, which
Dukakis, Bush and Quayle oppose.
   _The Democrat senator sided with Quayle and most Republicans to
kill a six-month extension of the amnesty period for illegal
immigrants.
   _Quayle voted for the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme
Court; Bentsen voted with the Senate majority to reject it.
   _The Republican led a successful fight in 1986 to win
confirmation of Daniel Manion to a seat on a federal appeals bench
in Indiana. Critics had challenged the conservative lawyer's
credentials. Bentsen voted against Manion.
   Quayle says he opposes abortion except to save a mother's life,
and he has voted for an anti-abortion constitutional amendment and
against federal funding of abortions. Bentsen also says he
personally opposes abortion and federal funding except in cases of
rape, incest or to save a mother's life. But he has often voted
against restrictions on funding and has voted against a
constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
   The centrist Bentsen got identical ratings from the AFL-CIO and
the American Conservative Union in 1986: 50 percent from each.
Quayle got a grade of 82 percent from the conservative group, but
only an 8 percent from the labor federation.

   If Pinocchio were running for president, he'd
have a mighty long nose.
   Evasions and distortions seem to be standard fare, both on the
campaign trail and when the candidates come together to debate.
   A case in point:
   Democrat Michael Dukakis said in last Sunday's debate that
George Bush's administration had ``cut and slashed and butchered''
nutrition and education programs and ``hurt kids all over this
country.'' He charged it ``has cut federal aid to education, has
cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity
on youngsters all over this country.''
   Bush, who says he wants to be ``the education president,'' shot
back: ``The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the
federal government. It is up, not down.''
   The fact is that the U.S. Department of Education's budget has
grown since 1981 from $15 billion to nearly $21 billion _ but it is
no thanks to Reagan, who sought repeatedly to slash up to $5
billion from education.
   The Pell Grant budget grew from $2.4 billion in 1980-81 to $3.7
billion for 1987-88. The College Board says total federal student
aid, including loans, has grown from $14.4 billion to $18.4
billion, a 28 percent increase. But after inflation, the aid is
actually down 4 percent.
   Education groups and Democrats in Congress say that although
they beat back most of the Reagan cuts, the education budget has
lost ground to inflation.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., the chairman of the House
Education and Labor Committee, said Bush's statement was ``at best
... very misleading.''
   In the debate, Bush, while attacking Dukakis' national health
insurance plans, suggested that he himself would ``permit people to
buy into Medicaid,'' and he promised ``full enforcement of the
catastrophic health insurance.''
   But he has not said how his Medicaid suggestion would work, and
the catastrophic health insurance he mentioned is only for the
elderly or disabled workers on Medicare.
   Bush frequently attacks Dukakis' record as governor of
Massachusetts, accusing him of presiding over ``the Massachusetts
mirage,'' and not ``the Massachusetts miracle'' that the Democrat
boasts about.
   Bush and his running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, have
depicted Massachusetts as a veritable economic basket case, ranking
40th out of the 50 states in job growth, having lost 36,400
manufacturing jobs since 1982 and having piled up a $7.4 billion
debt _ ``more debt than all previous governors of Massachusetts
combined,'' Quayle said.
   Dukakis' economics adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, charged that
Bush has shown ``an astonishing disregard for even the most basic
economic arithmetic.''
   Total employment in Massachusetts has grown by more than 400,000
since 1983 and the state's 3.3 percent unemployment rate is the
lowest of the big industrial states.
   Although Massachusetts encountered trouble balancing its budget
this year, so did other states in the wake of last year's sweeping
changes in the federal tax code. It has kept its high bond rating,
and Moody's Investors Service says its economy remains ``among the
strongest in the country.''
   The state's current debt is actually $3.9 billion, not $7.4
billion.
   In their Sept. 25 debate, asked about Dukakis' charge that Bush
``never met a weapons system that you didn't like,'' the vice
president replied: ``I can tell him some I'm against: A6F, for
example, DIVAD, and I can go on and on. ... I mean, there's plenty
of them that I oppose.''
   It turned out that the A6F was a new version of an existing Navy
bomber, killed by Congress last year as too expensive, and the
DIVAD, or Sgt. York, gun was an anti-aircraft weapon scrapped by
then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in 1985.
   Dukakis, for his part, under fire from Bush for once supporting
a nuclear freeze, said in their debate: ``Back in the spring of
1982, Mr. Bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he
seems to be today.''
   The Dukakis campaign cited a Bush speech in April 1982 warning
against ``partisan demagoguery'' in the debate over nuclear weapons.
   But Bush also reiterated Reagan administration arguments that a
freeze would lock in place Soviet missile superiority in Europe.
Bush helped line up support among the allies in Europe for the U.S.
negotiating position that eventually helped produce the
intermediate nuclear forces treaty with the Soviets.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's sudden overhaul
of the Kremlin power structure reinvigorates his reform drive and
signals his determination to best the bureaucracy he blames for
slowing him down.
   The Soviet leader's swiftly executed power play Friday and
Saturday elevated him to the presidency, put him in charge of the
government as well as the ruling Communist Party and left the
Kremlin with no clear No. 2.
   In action-packed top-level meetings, Gorbachev practically
established a mandatory retirement age by pushing all but one
septuagenarian off the party's ruling Politburo and sent an
unmistakable message through the vast Soviet bureaucracy that he
expects a similar pruning of dead wood at all levels.
   At the same time, by easing the 79-year-old President Andrei A.
Gromyko into retirement with praise and a televised swan song, he
opened the way for Soviet officials to leave office gracefully, a
necessary prelude to the institution of fixed terms of office for
party and government officials.
   The sole survivor from the Old Guard is Vladimir V.
Shcherbitsky, 70, whose power base built during 16 years as
Ukrainian party boss apparently continues to insulate him from
Gorbachev's campaign to replace old blood with new.
   The new face in the 12-man Politburo, Vadim A. Medvedev, 59, was
catapaulted over eight candidate, or non-voting, Politburo members
to full voting status. He was given responsibility for ideology,
which by previous custom would make him second to Gorbachev.
   Medvedev, an economist regarded by Western analysts as a
proponent of radical economic reform and a member of Gorbachev's
perestroika ``brain trust,'' will share equal rank with five other
party commission chiefs, four of them strong Gorbachev supporters
and reformists.
   ``It was certainly spectacular to jump him into the senior
rank,'' said one senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition he
not be identified.
   It was even more meteoric than the rise of another Gorbachev
confidant, Alexandr N. Yakovlev, who spent only six months as a
candidate before rising to full membership on the ruling Politburo
last year.
   One Western analyst, also speaking anonymously, cited the
historical importance of ideology in the communist system. He
predicted Medvedev would be charged with redefining socialism to
permit Gorbachev to introduce market forces in the economy without
violating the tenets of prevailing communist political thought.
   The same source said giving former No. 2 Yegor K. Ligachev
responsibility for the farm sector of the economy ``is the start of
the process of easing him out.''
   Ligachev, widely viewed as Gorbachev's principal conservative
rival, nonetheless is moving to a field the reform-minded Soviet
leader considers central to his campaign to improve Soviet living
standards. And it is not yet clear how the new agriculture chief
will execute Gorbachev's proposals to reinstitute family farming.
   Diplomats have noted that Ligachev has spoken often about farm
problems in recent months, and the 67-year-old former ideology
chief has boasted of his record in improving food production during
his years as a regional party boss in central Siberia.
   During a stunning televised put-down of former Gorbachev protege
Boris Yeltsin last June, Ligachev told the national party
conference his old region had been self-sufficient in food for ten
years, whereas ``the district where you, Boris, worked for nine
years now has food rationing.''
   The suddenness of Gorbachev's move was not explained. It served
as a reminder that his encouragement of open discussion of problems
and more democratic electoral procedures have done little to lift
the lid of near total secrecy that shrouds the actions at the top
of the Soviet power structure.
   One diplomatic source said Gorbachev's key decisions may have
been approved at an unannounced Politburo meeting on Monday. The
party chief then hastily summoned the 300-member Communist Party
Central Committee and 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, or parliament,
to Moscow to ratify his choices before his plans could unravel.
   Ligachev, the source said, was on vacation outside of Moscow for
about two weeks and apparently did not attend the Monday session.
   But the report could not be confirmed, and the source himself
expressed some doubt about its accuracy.
   ``Gorbachev is a master of surprise,'' observed the longtime
analyst of Soviet affairs. ``He pulls rabbits out of the hat with
disturbing frequency.''

<HEAD>Students Defy Ban On Speeches; More Deaths Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SEIN WIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students on Saturday defied a strict ban
on public gatherings and gave anti-government speeches in the
capital, but the speakers and listeners quickly scattered when
security forces showed up.
   State-run Radio Rangoon said troops shot to death six people.
That brought to about 430 the official death toll since hard-line
Gen. Saw Maung staged a coup Sept. 18. Diplomats say the death toll
is much higher.
   In some of the first displays of defiance since the coup, about
10 students stood atop a parked truck and delivered speeches.
Witnesses said about five students attempted to stage a similar act
of defiance nearby.
   But in stark contrast to earlier mass demonstrations that led to
violence with heavily armed troops, both speakers and listeners
fled the scene quickly as security men arrived.
   Radio Rangoon said five people were killed while trying to
pilfer two government warehouses. It said a gambler was shot as
security personnel dispersed a group of gamblers in central Rangoon.
   Soldiers using loudspeakers asked the capital's residents to
surrender all illegal weapons and looted material and urged parents
to ``prevent children from going astray for fear of arrest.''
   The plea was aimed at stopping an exodus of young people toward
the Thai-Burmese border, where students are linking up with
minority rebels who are also fighting the central government.
   Some of those fleeing to the border said they saw troops line up
anti-government protesters and shoot them, but military authorities
said they had no intention of arresting students.
   Students were at the forefront of massive demonstrations that
failed to topple 26 years of authoritarian rule instituted by Ne
Win.
   Ne Win resigned in July and was replaced by Sein Lwin, a
hard-line military man. He too resigned after massive
anti-government protests and was replaced by Maung Maung, a
civilian who was ousted by Saw Maung.
   Over a public address system, soldiers told residents to turn in
all weapons previously announced as illegal. These include firearms
as well as crude homemade weapons like slingshots that fire darts
known as ``jinglees.'' The soldiers promised that no action would
be taken against those who surrendered material looted from
government warehouses.
   Shoppers were seen in downtown Rangoon in fairly large numbers,
although the capital's busy and colorful street life has sharply
diminished due to a shortage of money, lack of fuel for vehicles
and a ban on the once ubiquitous street vendors.
   The government ordered all civil servants and workers in Burma's
state-run factories to return to their jobs Monday or face
dismissal. Most government employees have been on strike since Aug.

<HEAD>Reporters Call His Plane ``Sky Pig'' But Dukakis Likes the Thing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD SKY PIG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has Air Force One. George
Bush has Air Force Two. Michael Dukakis has ``Sky Pig.''
   That inelegant and unofficial name has stuck as the campaign's
handle for the Democratic presidential nominee's chartered campaign
jet. The name has even appeared on a printed campaign schedule.
   The plane is a Presidential Airways Boeing 737 _ an aging,
relatively small jetliner that Dukakis has used since Republican
Bob Dole faded from the presidential race in the early spring and
relinquished it.
   Dukakis, by all accounts, has grown attached to the familiar
plane _ even though to some aboard it no longer seems adequate for
a presidential campaign.
   ``It's our plane of choice,'' said top aide Nick Mitropoulos.
   The question is: Why?
   At this stage of past campaigns, presidential nominees were
traveling in Boeing 727s or their equivalent _ larger, sleeker
aircraft, with more seats and longer range.
   Sky Pig is unable to fly coast-to-coast without a refueling
stop. It has seating for only about 100, compared to 130 or more
for a 727. Sometimes luggage has to be loaded onto a larger, second
plane that follows _ so the 737 can keep within takeoff and landing
limits.
   And Sky Pig has its idiosyncracies, like a tendency to drip
water from the ceiling through condensation on hot days. It has no
facilities for heating food.
   The name was coined by network television crews who have
accompanied the candidate for months. On its lumbering takeoff
rolls they sometimes yell encouragement: ``Up pig, up.'' There's
even a song, to the tune of the 1960s rock song ``Wild Thing.'' It
goes: ``Sky Pig, you make my heart sink.''
   The second plane _ an even older 727 _ follows Sky Pig, carrying
the spillover of staff, reporters, Secret Service agents, and
television crews and producers. But because it's faster, Dukakis
sometimes switches to the American Trans Air plane to save time on
a trip across the continent.
   Still, he always returns to the familiar plane.
   Press Secretary Dayton Duncan said Dukakis simply likes the
plane.
   He is comfortable, sitting in first class seats in the front
row. Behind him it is more crowded.
   Campaign insiders say he also likes the name Presidential
Airways on the side of the aircraft.
   The regular crew of flight attendants sometimes come along to
his campaign events.
   They always have aboard a box of Raisin Bran cereal, Dukakis'
favorite, and they keep a supply of Orange Crush, the candidate's
soda of choice.
   He seems puzzled that anyone would want to dump The Pig.
   ``Well, we've been on this plane for a long time,'' he said. ``A
long time.''

<HEAD>Father Of LSD Helping Raise Money To Improve Drug's Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The psychedelic drug LSD is 50 years old this
year, and the Swiss chemist who discovered the now-illegal drug
that influenced a generation is trying to help raise money to
spruce up its image.
   Albert Hofmann made the first batch of lysergic acid
diethylamide-25 in 1938. But it wasn't until April 19, 1943, that
he took the first LSD trip, by accident.
   ``Some trace entered my body,'' he said. ``I don't know by which
way, maybe a drop of the solution came on my fingers.''
   While riding his bicycle home from the lab, Hofmann started to
feel like he was losing his mind.
   But as the dosage dissipated, he said, he started to ``enjoy the
experience. Then I realized it was an important discovery.''
   The mind-altering drug eventually fueled millions of trips and
inspired a new wave of poets and musicians, before a government ban
on LSD filled the streets with rivers of bad acid.
   Hofmann, 82, is touring Southern California to raise money for a
foundation that is seeking to improve LSD's image and hopes to
build a Los Angeles library in his name, dedicated to LSD and the
psychedelic movement.
   Dr. Oscar Janiger, a professor at the University of California,
Irvine, who has taken the drug 13 times, is the founder of the
Albert Hofmann Foundation.
   He said his research between 1954 and 1962 on LSD and creativity
showed the drug has important scientific applications.
   ``It was a very valuable tool because it allowed us to make some
inferences about how brain chemistry works and how the mind really
functions in perceiving things around us,'' said Janiger. ``It was
a very important adjunct to neuroscientific research, and it was
used in that way.''
   The foundation's board of advisers include poet Allen Ginsberg,
who first took LSD in a 1959 government experiment; Ram Dass, once
known as Harvard professor Richard Alpert; neuroscientist John
Lilly; and Laura Huxley, widow of author Aldous Huxley.
   Janiger envisions the library as a ``world information center''
for the study of inner space, complete with lectures, seminars,
workshops and a newsletter.
   Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the library as Janiger.
   ``If it is strictly a research thing, you can't have enough of
that,'' said Michael Pavlick, head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's Dangerous Drug Unit in Washington. ``But with the
people involved, I hope they are not going to glorify it.''

   Protesters aiming to shut down Atlanta abortion
clinics face a tougher, less hospitable police force in their
planned repeat this week of the summer blitz that landed more than
750 of them in jail.
   Organizers say they expect hundreds of demonstrators for the
planned week-long protest. They say they'll find out where
abortions are being done and try to stop them, and that those
arrested were once again being asked to refuse to give their names
to authorities.
   Police plan to be ready and vow to keep the clinics open.
   ``They're going to see a different Atlanta Police Department
(this) week,'' said liaison officer Richard Hyde. ``We're tired of
getting on our knees and asking grown men and women to get on the
bus.''
   Atlanta police were fairly lenient during the summer
demonstrations, which began during the Democratic National
Convention, carrying protesters gently away from the clinics.
   ``We know how to move a person from point A to point B without
putting him on a stretcher,'' said police Maj. Kenneth Burnette, in
charge of the Atlanta precinct where some of the clinics are
located. He said the demonstrators violate constitutional rights of
women who seek a legally available service.
   ``This time, they're going to go to jail and they're going to be
treated like criminals,'' Burnette said.
   Advocates of legalized abortion are also preparing
counter-demonstrations and vigils and are training escorts to take
women wanting abortions through the lines of demonstrators at the
clinics.
   Protest organizers accused the police of threatening violence as
an intimidation.
   ``We are afraid of what the police are planning to do,''
Operation Rescue official Joseph Foreman said Friday.
   Also Friday, the city asked a Fulton County Superior Court to
declare the demonstrators public nuisances and restrain them from
blocking clinic entrances or coming within 15 feet of anyone
entering or leaving a clinic. The court did not immediately rule on
the request.
   Juli Loesch of Eire, Pa., spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, said
the New York-based anti-abortion group is ``expecting people in the
heavy hundreds to come to Atlanta, and there will be Atlanta
people, too.''
   ``We'll do what we did last time. We will find out (in advance)
which clinics are having abortions on a given day. These are not
symbolic actions. We are trying to stop abortions from happening.''
   Organizers say they plan to end this string of Atlanta sit-ins
Friday.
   The first Operation Rescue protest began on the second day of
the July Democratic convention, and the demonstrations continued
long after the Democrats left. Through the summer, Atlanta police
arrested 765 demonstrators at 17 sit-ins before the protests
slacked off in September.
   Most of those arrested did not carry identification and gave
authorities aliases of ``Baby John Doe'' or ``Baby Jane Doe,''
making it impossible for police to free them on bond. The aliases,
protesters said, were to symbolize their link to what they consider
to be the anonymous victims of abortion.
   Several demonstrators spent a month or more in jail, and three
were still there Saturday, including two men who have spent more
than two months in jail. Ms. Loesch said those who could take the
time to stay in jail would be encouraged to use the same no-name
tactic this week.
   Arrests and jail expenses in the summer protests came to about
$500,000 for the city of Atlanta, which gradually toughened its
stance against the protests. Police started dragging protestors to
jail-bound buses instead of carrying them. Vans of protesters en
route to targeted clinics were given traffic tickets. The
convention expedient of freeing identified demonstrators on
recognizance bonds ended, and the courts began demanding cash or
surety bonds of up to $2,000.
   Nationwide, Ms. Loesch said, 6,364 Operation Rescue protesters
have been arrested in about 30 cities this year. The group
maintains that its actions have persuaded about 370 women not to
have abortions.

   A black horde of tiny toads invaded
a retirement complex again Saturday, literally blocking doors and
conjuring up memories of horror films.
   ``The whole yard looks like its moving. They just completely
cover everything. It's unreal,'' Donna Abshier, assistant
administrator of the Forest Glen Lodge, said of the plague that
began Friday.
   ``It put me in mind of those movies, `The Bees' and `The Birds'
or something,'' Ms. Abshier said. ``I can't believe how many there
were. We couldn't open the doors because they'd hop in.''
   ``It was so bad you couldn't even see the road out here,'' said
her colleague, Bonnie Martakis.
   ``They're smaller than my fingernail,'' Ms. Abshier said. ``We
wonder what their destination is.''
   Although the invading horde looked like frogs, close inspections
showed they were baby toads, a byproduct of flooding in parts of
Pasco County, said Bob Steiger, county agricultural extension agent.
   ``There are millions of them out there right now,'' Steiger
said. ``We've had a couple of dozen calls about them. They're
saying the ground's alive with them.''
   ``They're totally harmless,'' he said. ``They're actually a
benefit because they'll eat up all these mosquitoes we've had.''

   President Reagan, saying that ``all the ...
work is done,'' announced today that he'd signed all 13 spending
bills that fund the federal government.
   ``I'm happy to report that today, Oct. 1, marks the beginning of
the fiscal year and at this hour, for the first time in years, all
the government's budgetary work is done,'' Reagan announced in his
weekly radio address.
   ``The last of the government's 13 appropriations bill have been
delivered to me and I have signed them,'' Reagan said in his
address from the Oval Office.
   The president noted that ``it was touch and go for a while.''
   In a statement released by the White House, Reagan lauded the
lawmakers.
   ``Congress deserves a pat on the back for completing all 13
separate appropriations bills for a fiscal year. They worked long
and hard to meet this year's deadline,'' the statement said.
   With just three minutes to spare after a frantic day-long
session, Congress wrapped up its work on all 13 appropriations
bills before the new fiscal year began this morning.
   The achievement marked the first time since 1976 that Congress
has passed separately all the appropriations bills, which keep
federal agencies functioning, before the beginning of the new
fiscal year.
   ``We just barely beat the midnight deadline, but we did,''
Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., told his colleagues
early today, minutes after they agreed to House language on a $14.3
billion foreign aid measure. ``We can all feel good about that.''
   Reagan said he'd signed the six remaining appropriations
measures early today. He received a bill for the Commerce, Justice
and State departments on Tuesday and signed a seventh spending
bill, a $10.8 billion measure for transportation, earlier Friday.
   Reagan had hoped to sign the last of the bills Friday night upon
returning to the White House from Chicago, but they had not been
cleared by Congress by the time the president retired for the
evening.
   At three minutes before midnight Friday, senators accepted by
voice vote House language on the foreign aid measure, finishing a
marathon day in which Congress cleared five appropriations bills.
   Two minutes later, a puffing House clerk ran into the Senate
chamber carrying the House legislation, technically sealing the
agreement reached by the vote minutes earlier.
   Budget fights between Congress and the president have been the
rule since 1976, resulting in some or all of the spending measures
being wrapped together. Presidents object to that because as the
bills grow to cover more and more federal agencies, the political
consequences of a veto become more serious.
   Last year saw Reagan sign a single bill covering all federal
agencies worth more than $600 billion. He promised to veto anything
ressembling it this year and lawmakers strove from the beginning of
the year to avoid a replay.
   There would have been little discernible immediate impact if the
spending bills were not completed Friday. Few federal employees
work on weekends, and essential workers like air traffic
controllers and soldiers are required to report anyway.
   Had Reagan signed all the bills before midnight, it would have
been the first time since 1948 that all appropriations bills were
enacted before the start of the new fiscal year.
   But they were not ready when the president shortly before 11
p.m. returned to the White House where a formal signing ceremony
had been scheduled for the Oval Office but then canceled.
   Reagan decided to criticize the lawmakers, instead.
   ``I had hoped that we could mark the end of the
dog-ate-my-homework era of congressional budgetry, but it was not
to be,'' he told reporters.
   The other bills lawmakers finished Friday were measures
providing $282 billion for defense, $46.6 billion for agriculture,
$14.3 billion for foreign aid, $3.2 billion for the District of
Columbia, and $1.8 billion for Congress' own coffers.
   As lawmakers neared the end of their work, they gave two
standing ovations to Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., the 87-year-old
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee who is retiring
from the Senate after this year.
   ``I'm proud, but it's not really the chairman who's entitled to
the credit,'' the courtly Mississippian said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev grasped the top government
and Communist Party authority in his own hands Saturday, succeeding
President Andrei A. Gromyko to climax a breathtaking two-day
assault on the Kremlin's Old Guard.
   The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet unanimously elected Gorbachev
president just 25 hours after a hasty gathering of the Communist
Party Central Committee streamlined the party apparatus and made
the biggest personnel changes since Gorbachev became party leader
3{ years ago.
   The Kremlin shake-up fuels Gorbachev's drive to restructure the
Soviet economy and government and signals his determination to
dominate the entrenched bureaucracy he blames for slowing him down.
   A somber Gorbachev promised the Supreme Soviet _ the nominal
parliament _ that government bodies will take on a greater role in
everyday management of the country while the Communist Party
confines itself to policy matters.
   ``The soviets (government councils) must become the highest
authority on their territory and eliminate the shortcomings of
stagnation,'' Gorbachev said. ``The party will facilitate the
enhancement of the role of the soviets.''
   ``The soviets will take on their shoulders the major burden of
state work,'' he said in a brief address after the vote. ``As the
situation changes, we must change accordingly.''
   In its 42-minute session, the Supreme Soviet also approved
without debate or dissent the selection of a new KGB chief, career
officer Vladimir Kryuchkov, and Gorbachev's recommendation for a
new vice president, Anatoly Lukyanov.
   On Friday, Gromyko retired from the 12-man ruling Politburo. The
party's policy-making Central Committee also removed another aging
full member of the Politburo and two candidate, or non-voting,
members and reorganized the powerful Central Committee secretariat.
   Gorbachev installed supporters in key Central Committee jobs and
appeared to demote Yegor K. Ligachev, said to be a conservative
Politburo rival, by putting him in charge of agriculture.
   The cream-colored walls of the Supreme Soviet echoed in
thunderous applause at the end of the 79-year-old Gromyko's
farewell address, in which he urged party unity and thanked the
deputies for their faith in him.
   Gromyko, a Communist Party and government stalwart from the time
of Stalin through the first several years of Gorbachev's reforms,
served 28 years as foreign minister before being elevated to the
largely ceremonial presidency in July 1985, four months after
Gorbachev took power.
   ``The star of socialism since October 1917 has constantly shined
and given light,'' he said. ``Thank you, comrade deputies, for the
trust you've granted me in the past and now. I have very deep
respect for it,'' he said.
   Gromyko then returned to his seat on the dais facing the
deputies and sat expressionless, abstaining from the vote that
removed him from office.
   When selected party leader in March 1985, Gorbachev chose not to
take the top government job, as his predecessors had. He held a
position as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the
country's highest executive body that Gromyko headed. That gave
Gorbachev sufficient ceremonial standing to conduct affairs of
state.
   But in June, the Soviet leader proposed creation of a new, more
powerful presidency in line with his efforts to strengthen the
government and limit the Communist Party's involvement in
day-to-day management.
   Gorbachev proposed that the new president be chosen by a
reorganized parliament.
   Communist Party officials have instructed the Supreme Soviet to
make the reforms between October and next spring. It was uncertain
how Gorbachev's sudden assumption of government power affected
those plans.
   That may become more certain at another meeting of the Supreme
Soviet scheduled for the end of the month.
   The unification of top party and government jobs also raised an
issue that was debated hotly at the June party conference.
   Gorbachev urged then that party leaders be chosen heads of their
local soviets as well. He said that would enhance the status of the
soviets and make party leaders more accountable to the people.
   Other officials argued that such a system only continues the
party's long-time interference in everyday government affairs.
   It was not known why Gorbachev acted so suddenly to make all but
two of the 12 full and eight candidate members of the Politburo his
appointees.
   A diplomatic source said the key decisions may have been
approved at an unannounced Politburo meeting on Monday.
   The sudden call for a gathering of the 300 members of the
Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet brought Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov and other
officials scurrying home from abroad.
   Illustrating the suddenness of the changes, the Tass news agency
reported Saturday that a visit to North Korea planned by Gromyko as
Soviet head of state for the middle of October was postponed. The
visit was announced Monday in the government newspaper Izvestia.

<HEAD>Townsfolk Recall 1958 Racial Bombing Of East Tennessee School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLINTON, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty years ago, Pat Johnson recalls, the
windows rattled and knickknacks skittered about, rousing her from
sleep. When she and her family ventured out into the cool fog they
saw a fire a mile away downtown.
   Three separate explosions had distroyed her high school,
climaxing two years of race riots and tension in this otherwise
quiet town in mountainous eastern Tennessee.
   As Johnson and others crept toward the heaps of bricks and
mangled lumber and duct work, she zeroed in on the ripped-apart
steel lockers _ one of them hers _ and the wildly flung books.
   ``It was so scary. You just thought, what if they'd done it when
people were there?'' said Ms. Johnson, 45, who was in the ninth
grade then and now works for the Clinton Police Department.
   Clinton High School was one of the first public schools in the
South to be desegregated under court order.
   Eleanor Davis, who taught English at the school, says the Oct.
5, 1958, bombing was an ugly climax that ironically drew together
townsfolk who had splintered into factions and spat insults at each
other over the issues of integration and law and order.
   ``There were divorces over the question of sending the kids to
the school,'' Mrs. Davis said in a recent interview. ``We were
divided. ... There were all these hurt feelings around.
   ``That was one thing the bombing did. All factions came
together. We didn't want anyone to destroy our schools,'' she said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1954 ruled that segregated public
schools were unconstitutional. In August 1956, Clinton High was
ordered to admit blacks.
   The violence began, and the small police force did little to
stop it. Bombs exploded in blacks' yards. Those who wanted to obey
the law, even if they didn't agree with it, found their cars
overturned.
   On enrollment day in the fall of 1956, a dozen black students
who previously had been bused to an all-black school in Knoxville
walked past jeering bystanders to the red brick building followed
by reporters, photographers and the National Guard.
   The students, both blacks and whites, were quiet and
rule-abiding, although the races didn't mingle socially in the
school, Johnson recalls.
   ``They more or less stayed to themselves and we stayed to
ourselves. We didn't talk to each other,'' she said. ``Inside the
school, we didn't have any problem. It was the adults from the
outside.''
   Gov. Frank Clement eventually called in the National Guard and
100 state troopers, but not until after numerous riots and small
bombings, and incidents such as the beating of a Baptist minister
who escorted black children through a crowd of protesters at the
school's front door.
   Johnson remembers walking to school under the gaze of armed
Guardsmen in their jeeps. She also recalls the race-scored plight
of her next-door neighbors.
   ``They had an adopted child who had dark skin but was not black.
They were afraid even to let her go outside,'' she said. ``They let
her hide on the floor (of their car) when they went out to get
groceries.''
   The tension eased in the wake of the 1958 bombing, but nobody
was ever arrested. The FBI essentially dropped its investigation
when two main suspects died.
   The day after the explosions, the school's 800 students picked
their way through the piles of brick and shards of glass to gather
in the gymnasium and learn what to do next.
   The same week they began their orderly bus rides to Linden
Elementary School in already-integrated Oak Ridge, where they sat
in tiny desks and drank from knee-high water fountains until a new
Clinton school was built.
   ``We didn't miss a day of school because of the bombing,'' said
Mrs. Davis.

   Army troops and police reported an
uneasy calm in two southern cities Saturday, one day after ethnic
violence left at least 172 people dead.
   Officials said Sindhi nationalists in apparently coordinated
attacks fired Friday from moving cars on Mohajir immigrants in
buses and marketplaces, killing at least 140 in Hyderabad and 32 in
Karachi.
   Area hospitals, however, reported a higher toll _ 217 fatalities
and 400 injuries, including several Sindhis killed in retaliatory
shootings Saturday by Mohajirs who set up roadblocks.
   Army troops eventually drove the rioters from the streets of
Karachi by nightfall.
   ``The situation is returning to normal,'' Chief Minister Akhtar
Ali Kazi, the top executive of Sind province, said in a statement.
   Both Hyderabad and Karachi, Pakistan's largest city with 8
million residents, have been the scene of bloody ethnic clashes
between Mohajirs and Sindhi separatists who want Sind province to
be independent of Pakistan.
   The 107 million people of this Moslem nation, carved out of
predominantly Hindu India at the end of British rule in 1947, form
a patchwork of rival ethnic groups stretching south from the
Himalayas to the Indian Ocean.
   Pakistan officially recognizes nationalities of its four
provinces: the Pathans of the northwest province bordering
Afghanistan, the Baluchis of arid Baluchistan, the Punjabis of
Punjab in the east and the Sindhis of Sind province in the south.
   But the weekend massacre involved a fifth major group: the
Mohajirs, who immigrated mostly from India and, in the last decade,
from Bangladesh.
   The increase in Mohajirs, especially in Sind province, has led
to repeated clashes in recent years with the Sindhis, Pathans and
Punjabis.
   The most militant Sindhis are members of the Jeay Sindhi
Movement, which is campaigning for an independent state of
``Sindhudesh.''
   The Mohajirs, who dominate the province's cities, have formed
the Mohajir Quami Movement to press for official recognition as a
fifth nationality.
   Ali Hassan, a Hyderabad resident who saw the violence, told The
Associated Press by telephone: ``It was hell.
   ``The markets were full of people. ... When bullets were sprayed
from a moving car, there was panic and people started running for
shelter,'' Hassan said.
   Hassan said about 10 cars and jeeps opened fire in several
different parts of the city _ at public gatherings, a wedding,
movie houses and bus stops.
   ``It was a very well-planned attack and executed with
perfection,'' Hassan said.
   Officials said the Hyderabad massacre was the worst in history
for the city of 1 million.
   The highest death toll ever reported previously in that city was
18 in riots last July that followed an unsuccessful attempt by
Sindhi student radicals to assassinate Mohajir Mayor Aftab Sheikh.
   Clashes between Mohajirs and Pathans started in Karachi in 1985
over a fatal traffic accident. Riots continued for nearly six weeks
and left about 60 dead.
   The worst violence in Pakistan's history was in late 1986 when
the two groups battled almost daily for months. Authorities said
about 200 people died but unofficial estimates were much higher.

   As hundreds of NASA

   The $3.5 billion pad, standing next to the Pacific Ocean on the
central California coast, was intended to give the Air Force a way
to launch shuttles into polar orbit _ in which they circle the
globe north to south, instead of east to west.
   The Air Force still needs to put its satellites into polar
orbits, because that is the path best suited for satellites to spy
on the Soviet Union, but not necessarily with the shuttle. The
explosion of the Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, convinced the Air
Force that it should not rely on the shuttle but should turn to
unmanned, expendable rockets to launch its satellites.
   The decision halted a mammoth effort begun in 1979, building
enormous movable structures as well as a harbor. It also guaranteed
that a shuttle will not be launched from Vandenberg for many years,
if ever.
   One casualty was the nearby coastal community of Lompoc, which
was forced to trade shuttle launches for flower festivals as its
main tourist attraction.
   Shuttle launches were expected to draw throngs of people to the
scenic community of 32,000 that is surrounded by fields of flowers.
But when it became clear a shuttle might never be launched from
Vandenberg, Lompoc pinned its hopes for the future on the town's
distinction as producer of more than half of the world's flower
seeds.
   After Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldridge declared in July
1986 that sole reliance on the shuttle was ``a major mistake for
this country,'' work on Space Launch Complex 6 slowed.
   The complex was dropped into ``minimum facility caretaker''
status, a level costing $40 million to $50 million annually and
requiring four years to reactivate.
   The Air Force soon downgraded the pad again and began
mothballing. The estimate of how long it would take to reactivate
slipped to the indefinite.
   ``We've never put a number on it but it's well over four
years,'' said Lt. Col. Dennis Masson, director of the Engineering
and Facilities Management Launch Facility Program Office. ``I would
guess, personally, you're probably talking about six years easily.''
   One of the premises of mothball status was that much of the
equipment would be sent to NASA and elsewhere, and Masson has been
doing that, giving away everything from computers to screwdrivers.
   The Navy got M.V. Independence, a small ship that would have
retrieved expended booster rockets from the Pacific Ocean and
returned them to a small harbor on the shore of the 154-square-mile
base.
   Nearly 22,000 components worth about $85 million have been given
away: $75 million to NASA and about $10 million to the Navy and
other Air Force agencies.
   ``We know, for instance, when we ever start launching shuttles
here, I think we're going to have a whole new computer system. So
our computers are basically not worth anything to us,'' Masson said.
   The change to a new computer system means the pad will be far
from ready if it is needed.
   ``We could not just walk in and turn the buttons on,'' Masson
said. ``We'd have to go through a rather rigorous procurement
process.''
   The Air Force also would have to bring the launch site into step
with the current engineering of the space shuttle system. NASA has
made changes to the orbiter and ground equipment since the mothball
decision, and because most of Vandenberg's engineers have left, new
engineers would have to be brought in to assess the impact of the
changes on the launch site. That would add two or three years to
the reactivation process, Masson said.
   At the peak of construction there were 4,300 workers. In October
1986, when the site was put in ``minimum facility caretaker''
status, there were about 2,100 workers. Those plus 400 more from
Kennedy Space Center would have been needed for launches.
   Keeping the system in mothballs will cost $10 million annually
and require 40 or 50 workers, about half of them painters and paint
chippers. Layoffs and attrition have reduced the work force to 250
so far.
   Much of the maintenance will be inspections of the systems and
protection of enormously expensive items such as the 27-story,
8,000-ton mobile service tower.
   ``It would cost us a fortune, something in the area of over a
hundred million dollars to replace that particular structure,''
Masson said.

<NOTE>EDs: New material throughout with emergency over, satellite
ejecting nuclear reactor into high orbit.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials called off a nationwide
alert Saturday after the nuclear reactor from a Soviet military spy
satellite ejected into high orbit, obviating the danger of
radioactive debris raining to earth.
   ``The emergency is over,'' said Peg Maloy, spokeswoman for the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had coordinated
extensive preparations to deal with any danger that might be posed
by the satellite, Kosmos 1900.
   She said pieces of the satellite had begun disintegrating in the
earth's atmosphere, but added: ``It's just an ordinary drop _
there's no nuclear radiation involved.''
   ``Right now everyone is breathing a real sigh of relief,'' Ms.
Maloy said.
   Maj. Alex Mondragon, a spokesman at the U.S. Space Command's
Space Surveillance Center in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., said the
center ``is now tracking multiple objects in orbit apparently
associated with a change in status in Kosmos 1900.''
   ``There is debris in low orbit previously associated with Kosmos
1900, and now there is also new debris in a much higher orbit. The
additional debris is being catalogued and monitored by the U.S.
Space Command, but preliminary analysis indicates that the object
in higher orbit would remain there for many years,'' he said.
   Mondragon said that ``the larger, previously untracked object is
currently assessed to be the reactor section, with associated
debris.'' He said the reactor was orbiting the earth every 99.3
minutes at an altitude of about 433 miles to 476 miles.
   One piece of Kosmos 1900, he said, came down Saturday morning
over the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa, while
another piece was orbiting at an altitude of about 91 miles. ``It's
a small enough piece that we expect it to burn up,'' he said.
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass confirmed that Kosmos
1900 had shut down its reactor and separated with it when an
automatic safety system began functioning.
   ``The remaining part of the satellite (instrument compartment),
which will shortly burn up in the dense layers of the atmosphere,
poses no radiation danger,'' Tass said.
   Earlier, civil defense officials, working with 15 other federal
departments and agencies, had made preparations to open an
emergency center at the Department of Health and Human Services in
Washington, and to help coordinate state and local efforts.
   The Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda has called Kosmos
1900 a research satellite ``to observe the surface of oceans,'' but
U.S. experts say it is part of the Rorsat series the Soviets use to
track U.S. warships.
   Rorsat carries a radar-imaging device that beams radar waves to
earth then analyzes the return signal to spot objects as small as
destroyers. The nuclear reactor provides the enormous power needed
for the radar.
   The satellite was designed to automatically fire rocket engines
twice a week to correct a degrading orbit. Western experts noticed
in April that the rockets were not firing, and after reports
appeared in the U.S. and British media, the Soviets acknowledged
that they had lost radio contact with Kosmos 1900.
   The Soviets issued contradictory statements within the past week
on when they lost radio contact with the satellite. The Soviet
atomic energy committee statement said that ``in April 1988 radio
communication with this satellite was interrupted.''
   But the Communist Party newspaper Pravda ran an article by Prof.
V. Serbin on Thursday saying that ``radio communications with it
stopped last June.''
   Two earlier Rorsat satellites have fallen from orbit. The first
was Kosmos 954, which spewed radioactive flakes over 20,000 square
miles of northwestern Canada on Jan. 24, 1978.
   The Soviets redesigned the satellite, and most subsequent
Rorsats ejected their nuclear reactors into a ``graveyard orbit''
600 miles above the earth while the satellites themselves largely
burned up on re-entry, said Oberg.
   That system failed on Kosmos 1402, which splashed into the
Indian Ocean on Feb. 7, 1983. However, a backup system apparently
ejected the nuclear reactor from the main body of the satellite and
it disintegrated into dust on re-entry, according to American
scientists.
   Robert Leifer of the U.S. Energy Department's Environmental
Measurements Laboratory wrote in the October 1987 edition of
Science magazine that the reactor disintegrated in the stratosphere
47 miles over the Indian Ocean.
   Samples collected by a high altitude balloon accounted for 97
pounds of the 110 pounds of uranium and related isotopes that
Rorsat is thought to have carried, wrote Leifer.
   That means that radioactive dust settled slowly out of the
atmosphere in concentrations too thin to endanger human life, he
said.
   After Kosmos 1900 falls, the Soviets will have no Rorsats in
orbit, a condition that prevails about half the time, said Oberg.
   The United States has considered launching satellites with
nuclear reactors aboard, but has never done so and it not believed
to have a radar-imaging satellite in orbit.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of Andrei A. Gromyko's farewell
speech to Saturday's session of the Supreme Soviet, which replaced
him as Soviet president. The speech was translated by The
Associated Press:
   I would like to express my gratitude to the General Secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party Mikhail Sergeyevich
Gorbachev for everything he said yesterday at the plenum of the
Central Committee while addressing me, for the evaluation of my
work which included my work as chairman of the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet. The Central Committee plenum supported my request
to resign due to age.
   What else can I say _ my work is well-known. Nearly all the
time, starting with my appointment to the diplomatic service, this
work has been conducted in full view. The length of my service is
nearly half a century. I express deep gratitude to you, comrade
deputies, for our work together in these first years of the great
restructuring.
   All our people, the party of Communists, are busy with the
implementation of grandiose plans. New tasks arise and the elected
representatives of the people, the deputies, must take on the
modernization of the political system, the completion of the
creation of the social and legal state. It will demand tremendous
effort, but the Communist Party and its Central Committee are fully
determined to fulfill the daring and well-founded program for the
country's development.
   The enrichment of Soviet democracy and openness is a mighty
source for the Soviet people to derive strength for new
achievements both in domestic life and for the implementation of
the Leninist peace policy in international affairs.
   I believe in the tremendous strength of our ideas and
principles. Armed with this belief our people traversed the
difficult but heroic path after the Great October (revolution). We
all know what sacrificies were made at various stages of history of
the Soviet state. But our land of socialism not only survived, but
gained the power to move forward with a sure step.
   Yes, in the history of our country there have been failures;
they are well-known. We justly and surely condemn them. But the
star of socialism has been shining brightly ever since October
1917. It was kindled in the land of the Soviets never to be dimmed.
   People today expect the soviets on all levels to contribute to
perestroika. Such a contribution is worthy of the grandiose plans
set by the party.
   Experience shows that for solving the great tasks that confront
the country, our Leninist party needs not only a clear head and
sturdy shoulders but unity in its ranks as well. This necessity has
been proved by our history since October. The unity of the party,
its unity with the people, are as necessary for solving our great
tasks as air is to a human being. We have this unity in the Central
Committee, as well as in the Politburo.
   Surveying our great country, I would like to share a feeling
that is constantly with me _ confidence in tomorrow. What gives me
this confidence? First of all, the remarkable people living in the
country who can solve the most complicated problems. Second, we
have a wise and sagacious party closely linked to the people.
Third, the leadership that has been consolidated is worthy of the
great tasks the country faces at this turning point in the
development of Soviet society, and at this turning point in the
development of the international situation.
   The party and country, together with other fraternal parties and
countries, will continue the tireless struggle for peace among
nations. This is our main task, the essence of our life, and of the
lives of our children and grandchildren.
   Thank you, comrade deputies, for the trust you have given me.
   I appreciated and appreciate this trust.

   Hundreds of hot air balloons of every
color and stripe were launched into clear skies Saturday to kick
off the 17th Annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.
   About 150,000 people turned out shortly after dawn to watch the
mass ascension that traditionally marks the beginning of the
nine-day event, said spokeswoman Jean Jordan.
   The first wave of about 100 balloons drifted aloft shortly after
7:30 a.m., followed by four more waves for a record launch of an
estimated 580 balloons, Jordan said.
   ``It's a astronomical event,'' she said. ``Balloon Fiesta Park
is very jammed and really, really crowded.''
   Old balloon favorites like Tony the Tiger and Mickey Mouse were
joined this year by newcomers such as the Financial Times' balloon,
a cone-shaped affair that depicts a rolled-up newspaper.

   While most people prefer a ride in a
limousine to cap off their wedding day, William Beamish and
Jacqueline Erickson say a Greyhound bus was more their style.
   ``I think this will be etched in our memory banks for many
years,'' Beamish said as the couple and their wedding party walked
off the bus Friday. ``I'm sure everybody on the bus will remember
it. It's not something that happens every day.''
   Family and friends were chauffered to the wedding in the bus,
and after the couple tied the knot, everyone was treated to an
evening ride on the bus.
   Beamish and Erickson met through their jobs. Both are
Minneapolis-based Greyhound drivers.
   They've known each other for six or seven years, but romance
flowered between runs one night in Hibbing.
   ``We went dancing and fell in love. It was a surprise to both of
us,'' Erickson said.
   Since then, they have tried to catch a moment with each other on
all points of their bus runs between Minneapolis, Fargo, N.D., and
Madison, Wis.
   ``I'll think we'll have a perfect marriage. We'll probably see
each other once or twice a week,'' Erickson joked.

   Wayne County Jail inmates can obliterate
electronic enemies, flail at punching bags and wind up behind the
8-ball with some of the $129,000 of new recreational equipment
installed in two downtown lockups.
   Five new video games were installed Friday in the old jail
building, and pingpong tables, weight machines, pool tables and
other items have been installed in the new jail building next door.
   ``Clearly, we are no longer in an Eighth Amendment situation of
cruel and unusual punishment,'' said Sheriff Robert Ficano.
   The equipment was installed in part to satisfy court orders
giving jail inmates expanded recreational opportunities. County
officials said they also hoped the equipment would defuse tensions
among inmates and make the facility safer for guards.
   Inmates welcomed the new weight equipment. Said one: ``You can
go crazy in here, especially if you've got a case that's kind of
shaky.''

   A Discovery astronaut photographed
tiny protein crystals Saturday that are growing aboard the shuttle
in an experiment seeking clues for better drugs against AIDS,
cancer and arthritis.
   The crystals, if formed perfectly, would reveal the proteins'
complex molecular structure _ a needed step in drug engineering.
Without knowing what a protein looks like, scientists develop drugs
in a sort of hit-or-miss fashion.
   Crystals can be grown on Earth, but gravity distorts them and
they are small. Scientists have been successful at growing bigger
and more nearly perfect crystals in zero gravity.
   The crystals are expected to grow to about the size of table
salt grains before Discovery returns to Earth on Monday.
   Mission specialist George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson, who is in charge
of the experiment, took photographs of it several times Saturday to
document its various stages. It is one of 11 scientific experiments
aboard Discovery.
   The experiment consists of several samples of 11 different
proteins, including the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Once the AIDS
virus gets into a human cell, it uses the enzyme to take over the
genetic pattern of the cell and turns the cell into a factory that
spreads the virus throughout the body.
   With a knowledge of the protein's structure, researchers would
have a better chance of someday developing a drug that would stop
reverse transcriptase from working _ theoretically stopping the
AIDS virus in its tracks.
   The AIDS experiment, developed at Burroughs Wellcome in Research
Triangle Park, N.C., was approved to fly on the shuttle late this
summer after NASA officials were convinced there was no threat to
the astronauts.
   Dr. Tom Krenitsky of Burroughs Wellcome said the experiment is
``very promising.'' But he cautioned that even if the test produces
perfect crystals of reverse transcriptase, a new drug could still
be 10 years away.
   The experiment's apparatus has 60 chambers that house protein
solution samples in syringes. Once in orbit, Nelson turned a crank
to extrude the solution and start the growing process. A droplet of
protein hangs from the syringe and the crystals form within.
   The drops will be retracted before reentry Monday and the entire
apparatus will be turned over to an investigating team for analysis.
   The other proteins in the experiment include elastace and human
renin. Elastace is an enzyme involved in the degradation of lung
tissue in people suffering from emphysema and human renin is
produced by the kidneys and plays a major role in the chemical
reaction that controls blood pressure.
   Dr. Charles Bugg of the University of Alabama-Birmingham,
principal investigator for the entire protein crystal growth
experiment, said another substance is purine nucleoside
phophorylase, or PNP.
   PNP, he said, is found in large concentrations in the blood and
chews up anti-cancer agents injected into patients. It also is
involved in that part of the immune system that rejects tissue
transplants and in auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

   Truong Chinh, a hard-line Marxist
ideologue who helped found Vietnam's Communist Party and served as
its leader, died from injuries suffered in a fall, the Vietnam News
Agency said Saturday. He was 81.
   Communist literature once lauded Chinh as ``the first builder
and commander of the Vietnam revolution.'' He served twice as the
Communist Party chief, once in the 1950s and again in 1986.
   U.S. government documents described him as Vietnam's most hated
leader, having the mind of a ``fanatic.'' French historian Bernard
Fall estimated 50,000 people were executed in Chinh's drive to
``reform'' the North Vietnamese countryside during the 1950s.
   The official news agency said Chinh died at his Hanoi home
Friday of severe hemorrhage more than one hour after an accidental
fall. Five days of official mourning begin Sunday.
   Chinh began his political life 63 years ago and was one of the
last of Vietnam's Old Guard revolutionaries. He belonged to a
passing generation of leaders who founded the country's Communist
Party, fought four wars and united the nation in 1975.
   His death leaves only Pham van Dong, Le Duc Tho and Vo Nguyen
Giap among a group of near legendary figures who fought the French,
Japanese, Americans and Chinese but failed to bring prosperity or
personal freedoms to Vietnam once the wars were won.
   Except for a brief eclipse after the disastrous land reforms,
when he resigned as Communist Party chief, Chinh remained near the
pinnacle of power from the 1930s. He long held the No. 2 spot in
the party's Politburo and in 1981 was named chairman of the newly
created State Council, the most powerful government organ.
   He took over leadership of the party again on July 14, 1986
after the death of another top Old Guard revolutionary, Le Duan.
   Chinh was replaced as the party's general secretary in December
1986 when reformers led by his successor, Nguyen Van Linh, gained
the upper hand.
   He had since served as an adviser to the party.
   The official reason for his resignation was old age and
declining health, but failure to pull Vietnam out of serious
economic problems was widely believed to be the real reason.
   Chinh made his name as a party organizer and Marxist ideologue.
   Once regarded as pro-Chinese rather than pro-Soviet, he changed
his name of Dang Xuan Khu to Truong Chinh, meaning ``Long March,''
because of his admiration of the epic march of Chinese leader Mao
Tse-tung.
   According to his official biography, Chinh was born in the
northern province of Ha Nam Ninh, began political activities in
1925 and joined the Revolutionary Youth League. In 1930 he became
one of the founding members of the Indochinese Communist Party.
   Like many of his colleagues, he was imprisoned by the French
colonial rulers and at the outbreak of World War II fled to China
where he helped organize forces.
   Under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, they entered Hanoi in
triumph at the end of the war and proclaimed the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam in 1946.
   In the ensuing war against the French, Chinh directed the
propaganda machine. By 1953, he was second to only ``Uncle Ho''in
the power hierarchy.
   His stature increased as the United States entered the war in
South Vietnam. Rather than throwing regular North Vietnamese units
into the conflict he advocated a ``protracted guerrilla war'' and
greater emphasis on political struggle.

   President Reagan signed on Saturday the last
of 13 spending bills for fiscal year 1989, praising Congress for
passing them on schedule and avoiding the ``perils of Pauline
budget games'' of previous years.
   ``For the first time in years, all the government's budgetary
work is done,'' Reagan said in his weekly radio address.
   ``The last of the government's 13 appropriations bill have been
delivered to me and I have signed them,'' he said hours after
Congress approved the money to keep federal agencies operating.
   The usually rancorous budget process was eased this year because
Congress and the White House had cut deals that virtually
guaranteed approval of the spending bills even before Reagan
introduced his budget.
   Lawmakers finished work on the bills minutes ahead of Saturday's
start of the new fiscal year. It was the first time since 1976 that
the House and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, had passed the
bills separately and on time.
   ``Congress deserves a pat on the back for completing all 13
separate appropriations bills for a fiscal year,'' Reagan said.
``They worked long and hard to meet this year's deadline.'
   Reagan said ``it was touch and go for a while,'' and added: ``I
hope the last 24 hours proved historic and marked the end of the
`perils of Pauline' budget games that Congress played for so long.''
   He criticized as minimal the amount of humanitarian aid granted
the Contra rebels of Nicaragua, and chided Congress for its
approval of a ``protectionist'' textile bill that he vetoed earlier
in the week.
   ``Nevertheless, simple getting timely Congressional action is a
great achievement. So, in conclusion, let me express again my
thanks and that of the nation to the members of both houses for
their conscientiousness in making this historic break with the
recent past,'' Reagan said.
   Had Reagan signed all the bills before midnight as he had hoped,
it would have been the first time since 1948 that all
appropriations bills were enacted before the start of the new
fiscal year. Last year Reagan signed a $600 billion catchall
spending bill, but he threatened to exercise his veto if a similar
measure was put on his desk this year.
   Reagan signed six appropriations bills Saturday, including a
$282 billion defense spending bill and a $14.3 billion foreign aid
measure. The other bills were signed earlier.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said in the Democratic
radio response that ``this early legislative action on the budget
has established a discipline that we haven't seen in perhaps 40
years.''
   Easing the way for completion of the 13 spending measures that
pay federal agencies' bills was the summit pact between Reagan and
congressional leaders last November.
   In that deal, broad spending totals were set for defense,
domestic and foreign aid programs, and an agreement was reached
that there would be no new 1989 taxes. That eliminated the
differences over which many lengthy, bloody budget battles have
been fought, and produced a tone that was less confrontational than
in the past.
   ``The credit should go to that summit agreement we reached last
year,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   The usual ferocity over spending priorities was tempered by the
desire of the administration and congressional Democrats to avoid a
repeat of last year's embarrassing budget finale.
   The result of year-long fighting was a $600 billion measure
covering all federal agencies, and promises from Reagan and
Congress to avoid that outcome again.
   ``Both sides saw the benefit to programs of the government and
to the orderly functioning of government to rise above any kind of
political advantage,'' said Foley.
   There was another element to this year's budget process.
   ``This is the year of the big wink, the high art of blue smoke
and mirrors,'' said Rep. Don Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee last February on the day Reagan's
$1.1 trillion budget reached Congress.
   At the time, he was referring to a series of agreements on the
accounting methods that would be used to measure the federal
deficit that ensured the red ink would seem smaller than it might
otherwise.
   Those accounting formulas will have a helpful impact when it
comes to determining whether the fiscal 1989 deficit is within the
$146 billion ceiling set in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   Even with those favorable accounting methods, the
administration's Office of Management and Budget estimated on
Thursday that the deficit stood at nearly $145.9 billion.
   If the deficit should surpass $146 billion when it is measured
on Oct. 15, spending would have to be cut across-the-board by at
least $10 billion, an amount that would cause political pain for
lawmakers in an election year.

<HEAD>Former Wife of Late Beatle Also Denounces New Lennon Bio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cynthia Lennon joins the throng denouncing the
new, unauthorized biography of her late former husband, John
Lennon, as written by a money-hungry author capitalizing on
untruths.
   ``People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as far
as I'm concerned, they're gravediggers, no more, no less,'' Mrs.
Lennon says on the CBS show ``60 Minutes'' scheduled for broadcast
Sunday evening.
   ``Grave robbers, body snatchers, you name it, they are it.''
   The biography by Albert Goldman, ``The Lives of John Lennon,''
depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs
who raged his way from Liverpool to New York. It was released Sept.
14.
   Goldman, who defends his Lennon book and said it is based on
1,200 interviews, also has written controversial biographies of
comedian Lenny Bruce and Elvis Presley.
   Lennon was murdered outside his Upper West Side home on Dec. 8,
1980, by Mark David Chapman.
   ``All I know and all the people that love John know that we had
our years (and) that nobody, no film, no book will ever complete
what went on in our lives. That's our part of our hearts that has
to stay with us, must not be public,'' Mrs. Lennon said.
   ``I love John. I've always loved John because he was my first
love. But, I mean, I've loved him in different ways. I love his
memory. I loved what he did. I understood his madness, his phases.
I just feel that I understood.''
   The couple divorced a few months before Lennon married Yoko Ono
in 1969.
   Ms. Ono already has trashed the book, calling it ``totally
fiction'' in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the release
of the book. She too was interviewed on the ``60 Minutes'' show,
entitled ``The Two Mrs. Lennons.''
   ``These people in this book are not us. It's not John and me,''
Ono said in the taped radio broadcast.
   Cynthia and John's son, Julian Lennon, also denounced the book
on the radio taping, calling it ``lies, untruths,'' and adding that
``the whole thing is just sickening.''
   Sean Lennon, the son of Yoko and John who is now 12, added his
voice on the CBS broadcast, rebutting charges that his father was
inattentive to parenting.
   ``I think he did a lot of fathering in the five years that I
knew him,'' Sean says. ``He spent so much time with me not just at
home, but everywhere, you know.''

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, giving from the White House Oval Office on Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, in the past few weeks you and I and all
Americans have won some major victories here in Washington. These
victories didn't come easily, but each will help shape our nation
in the years ahead.
   One of the most important has to do with the federal budget.
Only once since 1948, has all of the budgeting of the United States
government been approved by Congress and signed by the President on
or before the beginning of the fiscal year, and too often when the
budget process has reached an impasse, appropriations have been
dumped into massive continuing resolutions.
   The worst of these came along last year. Congress poured all the
government's appropriations into a single bill. The bill was 1,057
pages long, weighed 14 pounds, and arrived over two months after
the fiscal year began.
   Not even Congress knew what was in it.
   I said in January that the next time Congress pulled such a
stunt: Well, never again. Well, I'm happy to report that today,
October 1st, marks the beginning of the fiscal year, and at this
hour for the first time in years, all the government's budgetary
work is done.
   The last of the government's 13 appropriations bills have been
delivered to me and I have signed them. It was touch and go for a
while whether we would actually meet the deadline. The
appropriations bill for the District of Columbia provided financing
of abortions long after most other federal abortion financing has
stopped. We said public money should not be used for abortions.
Many liberals said it should be. We won.
   The defense appropriations bill was also a close call. As you
know many liberals are opposed to our Strategic Defense Initiative.
Why they would want to deny America a defense against nuclear
missiles, a defense that the Soviets have been candid enough to say
they're building for themselves, why the liberals would want to do
that, I don't know.
   They have through various devices restricted how we spent money
on SDI research and development.
   These restrictions could have crippled critical parts of the
program, but early this week we got the restrictions removed from
all bills, and research will go forward to find a way to end the
nightmare of nuclear terror. I hope the last 24-hours prove
historic and mark the end of the ``Perils of Pauline'' budget games
Congress played for so long.
   Another recent historic accomplishment is passage of a bill
implementing the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement. When similar
legislation is enacted in Canada, North America will be on its way
to becoming the world's largest open market.
   Thanks in part to our successful policy begun the day George
Bush and I took office of opening markets around the world to
American goods, America is today in the longest peacetime economic
expansion on record. Canada is also growing strongly. Opening our
mutual border to uninhibited commerce will help that unprecedented
expansion continue into the next decade and the next century.
   This week, we won one other major victory in Congress and took a
giant step toward reform in the welfare system that is a trap for
too many of our fellow citizens.
   Now, I've often said that genuine welfare reform must be geared
to making people independent of welfare, and that means, among
other things, that those who receive welfare must be required to
work. Too many liberals have fought this idea every step of the
way. But yesterday, we prevailed, and the welfare reform
legislation that will arrive on my desk shortly includes a work
requirement.
   Even as we can take pride in these great victories, a couple of
other legislative battles continue to rage, over the textile bill,
which I vetoed this week, and the drug bill.
   On the textile bill, the problem is that the bill is
protectionist and would draw foreign retaliation against American
products. With America exporting more than ever, protectionism
means destroying American jobs, and I won't allow it.
   The House-passed drug bill provides for a federal death penalty
for drug-related killings. Liberals in Congress oppose the death
penalty and other necessary improvements in the law and plan to
kill the bill in the Senate. They've also recently cut funding for
the federal agencies that enforce our drug laws.
   It's time the liberals realized that the fight against drugs is
not ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' but a serious and dangerous
business. And our law enforcement officers should have all the
tools they need to do their job.
   I urge the Senate to follow the House's lead and give America a
strong drug bill. I urge Congress to act swiftly this week to
restore full funding to drug law enforcement.
   With your help, in the end, what is best for the nation will win
out. It has in many ways in the past few days. Let's hope Congress
will do what's right on the textile and the drug bills.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   A man who falsely claimed
responsibility for a fatal traffic accident because his son had
been driving without insurance has been sentenced to jail along
with the son.
   Ronald Haw, 49, a Culver City engineer, was sentenced to one
year in county jail Friday and three years' probation by Orange
County Superior Court Judge James K. Turner.
   Haw was convicted of conspiracy and a misdemeanor charge of
filing false information with a police officer concerning the
accident, which killed a 17-year-old bicyclist.
   Haw's 25-year-old son, Gary, was sentenced to two years in state
prison for his role in the Sept. 8, 1987, accident. He was
convicted in August of felony hit-and-run driving and conspiracy.
   Gary Haw was not insured to drive his father's turbocharged
Porsche. He admitted at trial that he lied to authorities about who
was driving at the time so the insurance would cover the damage.
   The younger Haw testified that he had not seen the bicyclist.
   He said that after the accident he called his father and asked
him to come to the scene. He told police his father was driving but
had gone for help after the crash and probably had become
disoriented and lost.
   The judge ordered Gary Haw taken into custody upon sentencing,
expressing concern that he might flee, said Deputy District
Attorney Pat Donahue.
   The prosecutor said the younger Haw deserved prison because,
among other things, ``He lied about the death of a boy, and also he
encouraged others to participate in this charade he planned.''
   Donahue said he also sought jail time for the father ``because
of the callous attitude he showed during the trial, the nature of
the lie and the fact that he was lying about the death of a boy for
insurance reasons.''

   President Reagan, saying ``I am the same man I
was when I came to Washington,'' contended Saturday that his
beliefs have been vindicated by the success of his superpower
policies.
   In an address at Georgetown University, Reagan said his policies
have brought about ``the receding tide of totalitarianism'' during
his two terms as president.
   The president said he's been ``steadfast and unapologetic,'' and
unwilling to accept Soviet nuclear superiority, the Soviet
occupation of Afghanistan or the presence of Soviet and Cuban
proxies in Angola and Nicaragua.
   Reagan said his principles hadn't swerved at all, even though
some conservatives had been leery about the administration's move
to ease relations with the Soviet Union in order to achieve the
first treaty banning an entire class of nuclear weapons.
   ``Contrary to some of the things you've heard, I am the same man
I was when I came to Washington. I believe the same things I
believed when I came to Washington. And I think those beliefs have
been vindicated by the success of the policies to which we held
fast,'' Reagan said.
   ``Yes, at every point on the map that the Soviets have applied
pressure, we've done all we can to apply pressure against them,''
Reagan said. ``And now, we are seeing a sight many believed they
would never see in our lifetime: the receding tide of
totalitarianism.''
   Reagan made the unusual weekend appearance at a school to help
celebrate the bicentennial of the nation's oldest Catholic
university. Accepting an honorary doctorate of humane letters,
Reagan spoke on the celebration's theme, ``Learning, Faith and
Freedom.''
   ``America is what she is because she is guided by all three,''
the president said. ``Americans know the truth of those words. We
still believe in our creator, we still believe in knowledge, we
still believe in freedom.''
   The president contended that rulers ``who enslave and victimize
the people of the Earth'' are coming to envy America's freedom.
   ``We prosper economically only because people are free _ free
not only to speak and read and think but also to create and build
and barter and sell,'' Reagan said.

   As the Congress heads into its final days before adjournment in
October, it seems a good time to reflect on these last two years.
The 100th Congress has been a landmark Congress. Guided by the
historic bipartisan budget summit of November last year, Congress
moved constructively and effectively to bring about a signficant
reduction in the national deficit that so threatens the country's
future and the economic security of every individual American.
   The Congress is determined to continue on this path of reducing
the federal deficit and moving further toward a balanced budget.
This year, we fully complied with the requirements of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. But, American society,
like the individual American, is compassionate. And Congress, as
the representatives of a compassionate people, moved to address a
series of longstanding needs that our nation could be better poised
to meet the challenges it faces.
   The congressional leadership set a goal last January to pass all
13 appropriation bills in time for the new fiscal year. This will
avoid the necessity of having to lump all federal spending together
in one major bill called the continuing resolution. We are well on
our way toward completing action on these bills and sending them to
the president for signature.
   The spending cuts contained in these bills will enable Congress
to meet the goals of last year's budget summit. They also enable
the 100th Congress to cut the budget deficit by some $70 billion
over the last two years. The deficit for fiscal year 1989 will be
about 20 percent less than it would have been without the
congressional budget actions, and this early legislative action on
the budget has established a discipline that we haven't seen in
perhaps 40 years.
   At the beginning of the 100th Congress, Speaker Jim Wright
announced an ambitious legislative agenda to deal affirmatively and
constructively with problems the public identified as being the
most serious. In terms of passing important new legislation, this
has been the most productive Congress in decades.
   Here are just a few of the landmark bills we passed: a clean
water bill to combat the pollution that has endangered our water
supply; a highway bill to mprove safety and mobility for the
traveling public; a trade bill to help reverse the crippling trade
deficit that has robbed our nation of so many good jobs; a
plant-closing bill to give American workers the same right to
notice before a lay-off that workers in most other industrial
countries enjoy; an education bill to increase the government's
commitment to quality schools; a housing bill to ease the
difficulties that young people face in purchasing their first home;
a Medicare improvement bill to protect beneficiaries from the
impact of financially catastrophic hospital and physician expenses;
a homeless aid bill to provide help to the most unfortunate
citizens among us; and a drought relief bill to help the thousands
of family farmers hurt by the crippling effects of drought.
   And before we adjourn, we hope to complete action on two other
major American priorities _ anti-drug legislation to give the
government new tools to carry out the war against drug abuse; and a
welfare reform bill to give welfare recipients the training and
supportive assistance they need to obtain and keep a job.
   As holders of the public trust, I think most of us in Congress
feel that these last two years have set a record the 100th Congress
can be proud of. But, let's be fair, Congress probably shouldn't
write its own report card. I'm confident, however, that in the
months ahead, the American public will look at the record and
conclude that these last two years have been a story of promises
made and promises kept _ that our major legislative goals have been
achieved and that we have built a firmer foundation for America's
future.
   Thank you.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to

   Good afternoon. I'm Tom Foley, the House majority leader and a

   Two experiments performed Saturday
aboard Discovery ended a long wait for a couple of students whose
projects originally were destroyed in the Challenger explosion more
than 2{ years ago.
   For Lloyd C. Bruce, who watched while his metal-melting
experiment finally was performed in zero gravity, the wait was well
worth it.
   ``It was great. I had a lot of fun. I've been working quite a
while on it, but I'm patient,'' he said.
   Bruce, a senior at the University of Missouri-Columbia, was at
the Johnson Space Center on Saturday and conducted his experiment
along with Discovery astronaut John M. Lounge.
   Richard S. Cavoil's experiment was performed later by astronaut
George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson. Cavoli was not at JSC because he
couldn't take time out from his medical school studies at the State
University of New York at Buffalo.
   Both 24-year-olds were high school students _ Bruce at Sumner
High School in St. Louis and Cavoli at Central High School in
Marlboro, N.Y. _ when their experiments were among those chosen as
possible student projects for future shuttle missions. Both
projects were assigned to the Challenger mission, which exploded
Jan. 28, 1986.
   After the tragedy, President Reagan promised Cavoli during his
1986 State of the Union address that his experiment would fly on a
later shuttle mission.
   Cavoli's experiment involved growing lead iodide crytals. The
experiment consisted of clear tubes that contained two chambers
separated by a membrane.
   Lead acetate was in one end and a solution of potassium iodide
was in the other chamber. The solutions were allowed to meet at the
membrane, where they formed crystals.
   Bruce's experiment consisted of a small furnace to test the
effects of weightlessness on melted titanium, a metal used in
airplanes and atomic power plants. He also conducted the experiment
on Earth so differences between the two can be later studied.
   At the same time, Bruce and Lounge flipped power switches that
heated one wire at a time. A closeup television view from Discovery
showed the titanium wires glowing brightly after they were heated.
   After the experiments were completed, Bruce said the one done in
space seemed to have performed as expected with two of the wires
melting and then breaking.
   And Bruce said he hopes it isn't the end of his participation in
the space program.
   ``I hope to be an astronaut,'' Bruce said, adding he plans to
apply for NASA's mission specialist program after he earns a
master's degree. ``This is one of my dreams.''
   Yes, Saturday was fun, but he added: ``It's not like being
there, I want to be there.''

   Entertainer Kenny Rogers' ranch in eastern
Georgia is for sale for $12.5 million _ complete with many extras,
as they say.
   Called Beaver Dam Farms, it has 332 rolling acres, a
15,000-square foot main house, a guest house, a couple of
picturesque lakes, five stables with a pool for the horses, and a
golf course in the front yard.
   The main house includes 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms and has a
complete photography laboratory. There's also a main barn with 46
stalls, luxury apartments and office space; a small 12-stall barn
with a two-bedroom apartment; an equipment barn; and the
six-bedroom, four-bath guest house.
   ``To use the word `barn' is stretching the meaning,'' said
Morris Bullock, a real estate agent handling the sale. The main
barn also has an automatic car wash and a laboratory for the care
of the horses.
   Rogers, who bought about 1,200 acres of pasture and woods in
Colbert seven years ago, originally put the property up sale about
three years ago. At that time the price tag was $11 million, but
that was before the par 72, 6,200-yard golf course was built.
   The country singer intended to raise Arabian horses on the farm,
but changed his mind.
   ``This is where I live,'' said Rogers, who is on the road much
of the time. ``But I don't have any more use for the barns
anymore.'' He said he still plans to live in Georgia after the sale.
   ``There's nothing ordinary about this place,'' he said.

   It was billed as Rosa Parks' retirement, but the
veteran civil rights figure doesn't plan to relax anytime soon.
   Parks, 75, retired Friday as an aide to Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich. But she said she would devote more time to the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute, which works with city youth. She founded
the institute last year, a decade after her late husband Raymond
died.
   ``I'm not going to be idle by any means,'' said Parks, who
triggered the modern U.S. civil rights movement in 1955 when she
refused to move to the back of a segregated city bus in Montgomery,
Ala. ``I hope to expand my activities. I will continue to move on
with whatever pace I have.''
   ``She is a legend in her own time,'' said Conyers, who employed
Parks in his Detroit office since 1965.

   Prince Andrew, the Duke of York,
reviewed the largest peacetime gathering of warships in Sydney
harbor, while 200,000 local people thronged the shores Saturday to
review the Prince and his Duchess.
   More than 17,000 sailors from 16 nations on 61 warships took
part in the Bicentennial Naval Salute, part of ongoing celebrations
to mark the 200th anniversary of European settlement of Australia.
   Prince Andrew; his wife, the Duchess of York; and Prime Minister

   The six, wearing wetsuits, plunged into the sea from the

police and arrested.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's Saturday radio address, given by House Majority
Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
   Good afternoon. I'm Tom Foley, the House majority leader and a
congressman from the state of Washington.
   As the Congress heads into its final days before adjournment in
October, it seems a good time to reflect on these last two years.
The 100th Congress has been a landmark Congress. Guided by the
historic bipartisan budget summit of November last year, Congress
moved constructively and effectively to bring about a signficant
reduction in the national deficit that so threatens the country's
future and the economic security of every individual American.
   The Congress is determined to continue on this path of reducing
the federal deficit and moving further toward a balanced budget.
This year, we fully complied with the requirements of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. But, American society,
like the individual American, is compassionate. And Congress, as
the representatives of a compassionate people, moved to address a
series of longstanding needs that our nation could be better poised
to meet the challenges it faces.
   The congressional leadership set a goal last January to pass all
13 appropriation bills in time for the new fiscal year. This will
avoid the necessity of having to lump all federal spending together
in one major bill called the continuing resolution. We are well on
our way toward completing action on these bills and sending them to
the president for signature.
   The spending cuts contained in these bills will enable Congress
to meet the goals of last year's budget summit. They also enable
the 100th Congress to cut the budget deficit by some $70 billion
over the last two years. The deficit for fiscal year 1989 will be
about 20 percent less than it would have been without the
congressional budget actions, and this early legislative action on
the budget has established a discipline that we haven't seen in
perhaps 40 years.
   At the beginning of the 100th Congress, Speaker Jim Wright
announced an ambitious legislative agenda to deal affirmatively and
constructively with problems the public identified as being the
most serious. In terms of passing important new legislation, this
has been the most productive Congress in decades.
   Here are just a few of the landmark bills we passed: a clean
water bill to combat the pollution that has endangered our water
supply; a highway bill to mprove safety and mobility for the
traveling public; a trade bill to help reverse the crippling trade
deficit that has robbed our nation of so many good jobs; a
plant-closing bill to give American workers the same right to
notice before a lay-off that workers in most other industrial
countries enjoy; an education bill to increase the government's
commitment to quality schools; a housing bill to ease the
difficulties that young people face in purchasing their first home;
a Medicare improvement bill to protect beneficiaries from the
impact of financially catastrophic hospital and physician expenses;
a homeless aid bill to provide help to the most unfortunate
citizens among us; and a drought relief bill to help the thousands
of family farmers hurt by the crippling effects of drought.
   And before we adjourn, we hope to complete action on two other
major American priorities _ anti-drug legislation to give the
government new tools to carry out the war against drug abuse; and a
welfare reform bill to give welfare recipients the training and
supportive assistance they need to obtain and keep a job.
   As holders of the public trust, I think most of us in Congress
feel that these last two years have set a record the 100th Congress
can be proud of. But, let's be fair, Congress probably shouldn't
write its own report card. I'm confident, however, that in the
months ahead, the American public will look at the record and
conclude that these last two years have been a story of promises
made and promises kept _ that our major legislative goals have been
achieved and that we have built a firmer foundation for America's
future.
   Thank you.

   A drizzle was falling on the Kremlin, wreathing
the thick red walls of the ancient fortress in mist, as the last
seconds in nearly a half-century of public life ticked off for
Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko, the Cold War's ``Mr. Nyet.''
   The chimes in the Spassky Tower tolled noon Saturday as a
glum-faced Gromyko and the 12 members of the ruling Politburo filed
into the cream-colored hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace to open a
special meeting of the Soviet parliament.
   Fifteen minutes later, the 79-year-old Gromyko retired from his
job as president, ostensibly at his own request, at any rate with
fulsome public praise from the man who succeeded him, Communist
Party chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gromyko's exit was the end of an era in Soviet political life,
one that began with wartime U.S.-Soviet collaboration and then
turned into the superpower brinksmanship epitomized by the Berlin
Wall and the Cuban missile crisis.
   Gromyko entered his country's diplomatic corps in 1939 and later
served as Soviet foreign minister for 28 years. His poker-faced
countenance became a symbol of Soviet intransigence worldwide, and
he was around for the East-West honeymoons as well as the quarrels.
   He served under Stalin and under all of the men who succeeded
Stalin as Communist Party chief: Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid
Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, Konstantin Chernenko and Gorbachev.
   In his three years as a permanent representative on the U.N.
Security Council, Gromyko cast 26 vetoes, sounding out his ``nyet''
_ no _ when it came his turn to vote.
   But four months after taking power in March 1985, Gorbachev
replaced Gromyko as foreign minister and relegated him to the
mostly ceremonial job of president. Gromyko retired Friday from the
Politburo.
   ``Thank you, comrade deputies, for the trust you have granted
me,'' Gromyko said Saturday from the Supreme Soviet rostrum. ``I
appreciated, and appreciate, this trust.''
   A loud ovation tore through the high-ceiling hall. Gorbachev
helped Gromyko back to his seat. Then the 1,500-member parliament
voted to retire him. There were no opposing votes.
   Gromyko sat in silence beside Gorbachev at the dais, facing the
deputies, as the Supreme Soviet members raised their right hands en
masse to send him into retirement.
   He did not take part in the vote that ended his political
career, but slouched in his green-upholstered seat, wearing an
inscrutable look.
   It could have been a smile. But it also could have been a
grimace. With Gromyko, it never was easy to tell the difference.

   NASA briefed members of
the shuttle recovery convoy Saturday and planned for a simulated
shuttle landing to prepare for Discovery's return to Earth on
Monday.
   The NASA-Air Force convoy of more than 200 people in an
assortment of vehicles will rush onto the hard, unpaved surface of
Rogers Dry Lake when the shuttle touches down.
   The convoy will spend about an hour ``safing'' the orbiter to
make sure hazardous vapor levels are below dangerous levels and
attaching lines to cool the orbiter and purge it of fumes.
   When the procedure is complete, Vice President George Bush will
be whisked out to greet the five astronauts at the bottom of a
stairway outside the shuttle.
   ``We're going to take him out to meet the crew,'' National
Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Ralph Jackson said.
``Once we determine it is safe, we will take him out.''
   The shuttle was scheduled to end its four-day, 55-minute mission
_ America's first manned space flight since the explosion of
Challenger killed seven crew members 32 months ago _ with a 9:33
a.m. PDT landing.
   Bush staff members, who arrived in a large motorhome bearing a
photocopied sign displaying the presidential seal and marked
``Official White House Vehicle,'' met with NASA officials Saturday
to work out details of the visit. Bush said last week he would
attend in his official capacity as vice president, not as the
Republican presidential contender.
   NASA planned to conduct a full-scale drill Sunday by simulating
a shuttle landing.
   Other NASA crews will ``do a runway walkdown, looking for debris
that might be on the runway _ wood or nails or whatever,'' said
Charlie Baker, shuttle area manager for NASA's Dryden Flight
Research Facility at this Mojave Desert military base.
   Asked how he felt about Discovery's landing, Baker replied:
``Let's get her down and get on with it!''
   On Friday, the orbiter will be lifted atop a modified Boeing 747
jet for its return flight to Cape Canaveral, Fla.

   The soviets will be able to tackle the new tasks only if they,
first and foremost, restructure themselves, the style and methods
of work.
   Each session, a meeting of the permanent commision, the
executive council and every day of deputy's work is to be filled in
with substantial work. The solution of the issues, put by the life
itself, should be brought under control.
   A great amount of work is in store for the soviets at all
levels, which is connected with the development of our state as a
rule-of-law one and a qualitative leap in society's legal
consciousness.
   It is precisely this way, through the extension and development
of the role of the soviets, that we will reach a rational
separation of rights and duties among the party and soviet bodies,
economic and public organizations.
   It is my conviction that under the current state of affairs,
this decision is the optimum way to promote perestroika, raise the
efficiency of the soviets and form a rule-of-law socialist state
basing on the unity of goals and everyone's responsibility for
one's work.
   It is precisely these criteria and the progress of perestroika
that we will apply to appraise all our future activities.
   Comrade deputies, it is an imperative of life, that the
remaining term of the current USSR Supreme Soviet be used to the
greatest advantage. A new impulse is needed to improve performance
of the Supreme Soviet, its Presidium, commissions and deputies.
   In accordance with the decisions of the 19th party conference,
the drafting of laws on changes and amendments to the constitution
and on the election of people's deputies is nearing completion. The
draft laws will soon be published for a nationwide discussion and
in November they are to be submitted for consideration to the
Supreme Soviet.
   Preparation for elections to the supreme body of power will
begin after the adoption of those laws. The newly elected congress
of people's deputies will form a new structure of central bodies of
power, with similar work to be carried out later at the republican
and local levels.
   This is a crucial task demanding thorough consideration by the
whole of our party. We will have to face many new problems and
adopt new approaches and methods of work, particularly in the light
of the separation of duties between the party and state bodies.
   The party will be most active in promoting the role of the
soviets, their self-dependence, initiative and responsibility in
attaining various economic, social and cultural goals.
   The soviets will take on their shoulders the major burden of
state work and energetically execute the party's economic, social
and nationalities policies at all levels.
   As we are beginning our effort to enhance the role of the
soviets, we should, of course, rely on the vast experience of the
Supreme Soviet and all soviets nationwide.
   At the same time, new forms required by perestroika should be
introduced boldly, as the old arsenal will not suffice here. The
new time we are living through today, the new conditions are posing
new objectives of greater scope.
   While tackling major domestic issues, the Supreme Soviet will
equally increase efforts in conducting the USSR foreign policy
which has in recent years acquired a dynamic and vigorous nature.
   Our international course is clear. It is the course of averting
the danger of a nuclear catastrophe, normalizing international
relations, establishing relations of equality and mutual benefit
between the world's countries and peoples, broad cooperation in
various spheres and securing every nation's right to freely choose
its destiny.
   This policy is fervently approved by the Soviet people,
supported by our socialist friends, meets with ever growing
understanding among large sections of the international public, and
is already bearing fruit.
   We will continue to unswervingly pursue this policy.
   The role of the Supreme Soviet, its Presidium and standing
commissions, and the parliamentary group is exceptionally great in
the pursuance of Soviet foreign policies.
   I count on your support for my work.

   With a boost from Kremlin chief Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, Estonians on Saturday opened a congress of a popular
movement pushing for economic, cultural and political autonomy for
their tiny republic.
   Gorbachev sent his endorsement to the more than 3,000 delegates
of the People's Front through his protege, Vajno Vyalyas, leader of
Estonia's Communist Party.
   The opening session in the Town Hall of Estonia's capital,
Tallinn, occured as Gorbachev was elected president by the Supreme
Soviet in Moscow. He replaced Andrei Gromyko, who resigned.
   Vyalyas expressed Gorbachev's ``greetings and wishes for
success'' and was greeted by the delegates with applause.
   The main demands of the nationalist People's Front are to make
Estonian the republic's official language; give it the right to
trade with foreign countries; allow the republic to conduct
business within the Soviet Union independent of Moscow's control;
and limit migration of Russians into Estonia.
   Officials say 28 percent of the front's members also are members
of the Communist Party. The front claims membership of 60,000 of
Estonia's 1.5 million people.
   Leaders of the People's Front, formed in April, said they
recognize the primacy of the Communist Party in Soviet society and
do not seek to break out of the Soviet Union.
   ``The People's Front is not a party. It is a movement and it
will remain a movement,'' Edgar Savisaar, one of the group's
founders, said in a speech Saturday.
   But many members say privately that their ultimate goal is full
independence from the Soviet Union.
   The two-day session was called to adopt a political platform and
formally elect leaders. Similar groups have sprung up in the other
two Baltic republics, Lithuania and Latvia.
   The People's Front organized a demonstration by hundreds of
people Saturday night. They linked arms in a human chain along the
cobblestone streets of Tallinn and chanted ``Estonia is in our
hands.''
   The chain stretched across the old town to the castle-like
government building.
   There, demonstrators were asked to look toward the building in a
symbolic gesture in support of demands that the flag of the
formerly independent republic be flown together with the Soviet
Estonian flag.
   The congress got under way with the sounds of two horns played
by an elderly man and boy wearing Estonian national costumes on
Town Hall's huge stage.
   ``The country and its children are waiting for action,''
declared the opening speaker, Estonian stage actor and director
Mikk Mikiver. ``The future of Estonia is in our hands.''
   Vyalyas, whose ties to Gorbachev go back to the 1950s when they
were leaders of the Young Communist League, met with Gorbachev in
Moscow on Wednesday to discuss the republic's reforms.
   Vyalyas, a native Estonian, on June 16 replaced the unpopular
and non-Estonian party chief Karl Vaino. He said the Moscow
leadership has firmly backed movements like the People's Front, as
long as they in turn support Gorbachev's ``perestroika,'' or
restructuring program.
   The Baltic people, the most westward-looking of Soviet
nationalities, have seized upon Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, to assert demands for preservation of their culture and
economic independence.
   Estonia has surged into Gorbachev's drive to revive the economy
and to address grievances of the country's more than 100
nationalities.
   The Baltic republics were independent countries from shortly
after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 until 1940, when they were
absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   Under Gorbachev's more tolerant policies, Baltic residents have
taken to the streets to protest the secret pact between Nazi
Germany and the Soviet Union that divided Eastern Europe and led to
the Soviet takeover.

   _Andrei A. Gromyko and Mikhail S. Solomentsev were retired from
the ruling Politburo. Gromyko also retired as Soviet president and
was replaced by party boss Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Solomentsev was
replaced by Latvian party boss Boris Pugo as head of the Party
Control Commission, which investigates breaches of discipline in
party ranks.
   _Vadim A. Medvedev, a Communist Party secretary, was named a
full Politburo member.
   _Two alternate, or non-voting, members of the Politburo,

   _Three new alternate Politburo members were appointed: Alexandra
P. Biryukova, the highest-ranking woman in the Soviet hierarchy;
Lukyanov, a Central Committee secretary; and Interior Minister
Alexander V. Vlasov, the nation's top policeman. Biryukova and
Lukyanov lost their jobs as party secretaries, but Biryukova was
named deputy prime minister.
   _Former ambassador to the United States, Anatoly F. Dobrynin,
retired from his position as a secretary of the Central Committee.
   _KGB chief Viktor M. Chebrikov was made a secretary of the
Central Committee to go along with his Politburo status. Vladimir
A. Kryuchkov was named by the Supreme Soviet to replace him as head
of the KGB.
   _Ivan V. Kapitonov, the head of the party's Central Auditing
Commission, was retired.
   _Nikolai V. Talyzin was removed as first deputy prime minister,
and made top Soviet envoy to the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance, the trade bloc grouping the Soviet Union and its allies.
   _The Supreme Soviet also retired Alexei K. Antonov, a deputy
prime minister.

<TEXT>
   A small earthquake beneath the San Gabriel
Mountains shook parts of the San Fernando Valley on Saturday, the
first anniversary of a deadly temblor that caused millions of
dollars in damage in Los Angeles County.
   The 10:56 a.m. earthquake measured 3.5 on the Richter scale,
said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   The earthquake occurred on a different fault than the
destructive Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier quake and was unrelated, Finn
said.
   Seismologists pinpointed the quake's epicenter at 19 miles north
of downtown, about five miles northwest of the Sunland district.
The location is in Angeles National Forest under the south slope of
the San Gabriels.
   The 1987 earthquake was centered in Whittier Narrows, southeast
of Los Angeles. It measured 5.9 on the scale and was followed by a
5.3-magnitude Oct. 4 aftershock. The two quakes caused eight
deaths, 200 injuries and $358 million in damage.
   An earthquake measuring 3.5 can cause slight damage in the local
area. Quakes measuring 5 and 6 can cause considerable to severe
damage.
   Residents and workers in the vicinity of Saturday's quake did
not report any damage.
   ``I'd almost describe it as if someone was just jumping up and
down on the roof a couple of times. We had a slight jar,'' said
Betty Smith, who works in the golf shop at the course in the Hansen
Dam recreation area. The dam is unused.
   Three Burbank residents called police to ask about the quake,
but nobody at the police station felt it, said said Sgt. Rick
Madrid.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has begun seizing the
assets of deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle, an affluent
businessman, the judge in charge of the confiscation said Saturday.
   Judge Lorenzo Parker Dupuy said the Treasury Department issued
the order after Delvalle was formally accused of acts ``harmful to
the people of Panama,'' including asking the United States to
freeze $54 million the National Bank of Panama had on deposit in
U.S. banks.
   The freeze, which helped bring the Panamanian economy to a near
standstill this spring, coincided with an unsuccessful opposition
drive to force Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's de facto
ruler, to resign.
   Parker said he began confiscating Delvalle's assets on Thursday.
He said the government seized 18 racehorses stabled at the
Hipodromo President Remon in the capital.
   The judge said he did not know the value of the horses or the
rest of Delvalle's assets.
   The Santa Rosa sugar firm, one of Delvalle's main businesses,
will be confiscated Monday, Parker told The Associated Press.
   Parker said Treasury Secretary Orville Goodin has ordered every
bank in Panama to freeze Delvalle accounts and turn over his
records by Oct. 7. Goodin also ordered all public registries and
notaries to turn over any information they have on Delvalle's
business interests, he said.
   Delvalle, 50, served as president from Sept. 27, 1985, to Feb.
26, 1988.
   Noriega had the National Assembly replace him in February after
Delvalle tried to remove Noriega as head of the Defense Forces.
   Delvalle tried to get rid of Noriega after a U.S. grand jury
indicted Noriega on charges of drug trafficking and money
laundering. Noriega has denied the charges.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle, who has been in
hiding since his ouster, as Panama's president.
   Parker said the sugar firm, which includes a mill in Aguadulce,
110 miles from the capital, will continue to operate. Parker said
he will ``protect the interests of investors and workers.''
   Parker said seizure orders were also issued against the assets
of two Delvalle associates: Juan B. Sosa, a former ambassador to
the United States, and Alberto Garcia de Paredes, consul general in
New York. Both are still recognized by the United States.
   The judge said the assets of Gabriel Lewis Galindo, another
former ambassador to the United States, will also be seized.
Galindo is a key opposition leader.

   VLADIMIR A. KRYUCHKOV _ A career KGB officer, the 64-year-old
Kryuchkov was appointed by the Supreme Soviet on Saturday to become
the new secret police chief. Little is known about Kryuchkov other
than information released by the Tass news agency in a brief
biography Saturday. Kryuchkov has been deputy chairman of the KGB
since November 1978. Tass said he held the rank of army general and
had held senior posts in the KGB for more than 20 years. He trained
as a lawyer and worked several years as a prosecutor. He also
served on the Central Committee staff from 1959 to 1967.

   For the second time in four months in
the Denver area, a United Parcel Service driver has foiled the
getaway of a suspected robber, police said.
   UPS driver Jeff Pryor was stopped at a traffic light Thursday
when he saw a suspected thief fleeing a jewelry store, said officer
Gordon Madonna.
   Pryor jumped out of his truck, chased the man and held him until
police could arrive, Madonna said.
   ``Without the UPS guy, the (suspect) would have gotten away,''
Madonna said.
   Police in Mountain View expressed similar sentiments in June
when another UPS driver, Tom Swartz, used his truck to ram a
getaway car being used by three people who robbed a store.
   Swartz at first was threatened with disciplinary action by UPS,
but later was honored as a hero.
   In Thursday's incident, a man took a $14,000 Rolex watch from
Williams Jewelers and ran, Madonna said. A store clerk chased the
man but was losing sight of him when Pryor joined in the chase.

   Discovery commander Frederick Hauck
soaked a piece of cotton in his mouth and then stored the fiber in
a sealed vial. That simple gesture may help NASA take another small
step toward landing people on Mars.
   The cotton soaked with saliva, which will be analyzed later on
the ground, is part of a major new NASA effort to determine how to
keep people healthy while living in space for many months.
   Dr. Michael W. Bungo, a researcher in space medicine, said the
medical community will have to gather a vast body of new knowledge
before it is clear that humans will be able to sustain the stresses
and physical changes that a two-year voyage to Mars would require.
   ``We know the human body changes in space, but we don't know if
it could adapt to 24 months of weightlessness that would be require
for a Mars voyage,'' he said. ``Right now, we are only confident
that people can stay in space (safely) for about 180 days.''
   A Soviet cosmonaut has stayed in orbit for 326 days, he said,
but NASA needs to collect similar experience.
   The agency also needs to learn how to deal with medical
emergencies in orbit.
   ``There will be injuries and illnesses in space and we must
learn how to deal with them,'' said Bungo. ``There is much right
now that we don't know.''
   A first step, he said, is to determine the type of medical
facilities required on the space station, a proposed NASA
laboratory that will house astronaut crews for many months, and to
explore the use of pharmaceuticals.
   Bungo said it is known that the human body changes quickly when
exposed to the weightlessness of space and these changes may cause
medicines to work differently than on Earth.
   ``Drugs may have to be handled differently, but how?'' said
Bungo. ``That's one of the answers we've got to find. Antibiotics,
for example, may be absorbed differently. You really don't know how
it's going to work.''
   Bloodflow through critical organs changes, he said, particularly
to the liver and the spleen, and this could affect the
metabolization of drugs.
   To explore this question, the Discovery crew members are acting
as test subjects. They have taken medicines which leave traces in
the saliva. By testing their saliva before, during and after the
mission, doctors hope to learn about drug absorption. The
experiment will be conducted on a number of shuttle flights.
   Bungo said the shuttle flights also will be used to test
surgical equipment, and experimental surgery may be conducted in
orbit on some future mission using animal subjects.
   So little is known about how to perform surgery in space, said
Bungo, that any surgical emergency aboard the space station will
require a quick return to Earth.
   ``There will be no major surgery in the early stages of the
space station,'' said Bungo. ``Nothing more than suturing of minor
lacerations is being considered.''
   Surgery in space is a problem, he said, because blood tends to
form sheets, instead of flowing away from the wound, and the
surgical field is obscured. Microbes also tend to float in space,
making it more difficult to keep surgical wounds free of infection.
   Even the surgical table may be a problem, said Bungo, until a
way is found to keep the patient and the surgeon from floating
around in zero gravity.
   ``There is so much we don't know how to do,'' Bungo said.

<HEAD>Hebron Residents Strike; 10 Wounded In West Bank, Gaza Strip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians started a three-day general strike
Saturday in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron, which army kept
closed to outsiders after violence left two Arabs dead.
   Soldiers shot and wounded at least 10 Arabs who hurled rocks at
Israeli patrols and blocked roads with burning tires in the West
Bank towns of Bethlehem and Nablus and the occupied Gaza Strip, a
military spokeswoman said.
   But a Gaza reporter said six were wounded in the strip, where
the army clamped a curfew on most of Rafah town to restore order
after school boys left classes to demonstrate in the open-air
market. Among the wounded was a 60-year-old woman shot in the
abdomen, the reporter said.
   In other developments, Israeli radio said a reserve army captain
would be reprimanded by his commander for tying a handcuffed Arab
protester to the bumper of a patrol car in the Gaza Strip. The
incident occurred days after the anti-Israeli uprising erupted Dec.
8 and was widely publicized.
   A military police investigation into the captain's behavior
concluded the officer did not mean to humiliate the youth and only
tied him to the jeep because there were no spare seats inside the
car, the radio said.
   News reports at the time indicated the boy was being used as a
live shield, to deter others from throwing rocks.
   In Jerusalem, a city spokeswoman said Arab school children from
grades 5-12 would return to classes this week.
   Grades 1-4 have already started school, but the beginning of the
academic year was delayed for the higher grades because police
suspected activists were using classrooms as gathering points for
violent protests.
   Schools and universities in the occupied West Bank will remain
closed till at least mid-November.
   Arabs in Hebron called the strike and closed city hall to
protest the shooting death of Kayed Hassan Salah, a shopkeeper
killed Friday when Jewish settlers and soldiers chased Arabs who
stoned an Israeli car. It is still not clear how Salah died.
   A second Arab, 18-year-old Said Hafez Karaki, died of bullet
wounds Friday when soldiers opened fire on a group of masked youths
who threw rocks on their patrol, hospital officials said.
   Large numbers of soldiers patrolled desolate city streets by
foot and armored vehicle Saturday to maintain a curfew that
restricted Arabs to their homes in the morning but was lifted later
in the day, the army said.
   The army closed the city to reporters Friday and kept it
off-limits to outside visitors after lifting the curfew.
   An Arab reporter, who lives in Hebron, said Jewish settlers took
to the streets of the old city Saturday morning to sing and dance,
possibly in celebration of the weeklong Feast of Tabernacles. The
holiday, which ends Monday, commemorates the biblical exodus of the
Jews from Egypt.
   The Jewish community in Hebron is home to 60 Jews who live among
70,000 Palestinian residents.
   The nearly 10-month uprising in the occupied lands has cost 280
Palestinian lives. Six Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip
from Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War.

   Seventeen people were killed when
eight rockets slammed into Afghanistan's eastern city of Jalalabad
on Saturday, Radio Kabul said.
   The state-run radio gave few details of the rocket attack. A
military correspondent with Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news
agency reported ``old men, women and children'' were among the
dead, said Radio Kabul.
   The report, monitored in Islamabad, said 34 people were injured.
   No one claimed responsibility, but Radio Kabul blamed ``criminal
extremist opposition,'' apparently referring to U.S.-backed Moslem
guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan.
   Radio Kabul also reported the deaths of two high-ranking Afghan
army officers. The two, General Abdul Rehman and Colonel Ghulam
Mustafa, were killed last month in the eastern province of Paktia,
the report said.
   The report did not give an exact date of the deaths or any other
details.

<TEXT>
   Antoinette Giancana, daughter of slain mob boss
Sam Giancana, plans to let people in on the favorite recipes, wines
and other culinary secrets of 35 well-known Chicago gangsters.
   While her previous work, ``Mafia Princess,'' let people in on
the bedroom activities of mobsters, Ms. Giancana's new project, to
be named ``Mafia Cookbook,'' will look at their talents in the
kitchen.
   She said the book will go beyond Italian cuisine.
   ``Just like my father, these men didn't enjoy just Italian
food,'' Ms. Giancana said. ``They wanted the creme de la creme
wherever they went and they got it _ steak divine, crab imperial.''
   Her father, one of the nation's most powerful organized crime
figures, was shot seven times in the head and killed in 1975.
   Ms. Giancana, 53, who fixed meals for her father's friends when
they visited, said she plans to add profiles on the mobsters who
ate the dishes and the reasons they asked for them.
   One source in the book will be Mike Fish, 85, who said he often
ate at the Chicago home of gangster Al Capone's mother.
   ``She was a wonderful cook,'' Fish said. ``Al was a heavy eater
who liked rare steaks. His mother would prepare a dozen types of
pasta, but Capone preferred spaghetti and meat sauce, heavy on the
cheese.''
   Ms. Giancana's autobiography, ``Mafia Princess,'' was published
in 1984 and later made into a television movie.

<HEAD>Escaped Activist Leaves U.S. Consulate For Medical Treatment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black activist who escaped
to the U.S. Consulate after police allegedly tortured him left his
refuge Saturday to get medical treatment, his lawyers said.
   Activist Clifford Ngcobo holed up in the consulate on Sept. 21
after spending five months in detention without being charged. He
filed a civil court action alleging that police assaulted him and
tortured him with electric shocks while he was in custody.
   The government said Ngcobo will not be redetained under
emergency regulations, but he faces possible prosecution on a
charge of illegal weapons possession.
   Ngcobo had joined three prominent anti-apartheid leaders who
took refuge at the consulate after escaping on Sept. 13. The three,
all held without charge for more than a year, say they will not
come out until all political detainees are released.
   The law firm, Cheadle, Thompson and Haysom, said doctors who
examined the activist at the consulate determined that he required
long-term therapy for anorexia and anxiety.
   The law firm said the decision for Ngcobo to leave the consulate
was based partly on the Law and Order Ministry's assertion that he
would not be redetained.
   ``The immediate and most pressing reason for his departure from
the consulate, however, was to ensure that he received proper
medical care and to interact with people in a normal environment to
facilitate his recovery,'' the lawyers' statement said.
   ``He is very fearful of redetention after his experience at the
hands of the security police.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Say Court Ruling Weakens Nicaragua Trade Embargo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAREDO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3-year-old embargo on trade with
Nicaragua was weakened by a judge's ruling that the Reagan
administration has been improperly enforcing the law, say opponents
of U.S. policy in Central America who sued the government.
   U.S. District Judge George P. Kazen said in a ruling released
Friday that the president has no authority to regulate or prohibit
U.S. citizens' donations to foreign countries ``which the donor
intends to be used to relieve human suffering.''
   The ruling limits the scope of the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act, the basis for the administration's economic
embargo on Nicaragua, plaintiffs in the suit said.
   ``I think it (the ruling) weakens the embargo,'' said Margaret
Ratner, an attorney with the New York-based Center for
Constitutional Rights, which helped file the suit in Laredo on
behalf of the Veterans Peace Convoy Inc.
   The convoy group has had difficulty taking aid for Nicaraguan
civilian groups, especially vehicles, across the border.
   ``There's no question it puts it (the embargo) on a level of
disrepute,'' Ms. Ratner added. ``Here we have a federal judge
explaining that the administration is using trade regulations in an
illegal, political manner.''
   Justice and State Department spokesmen had no immediate comment
on the ruling, because they had not seen it, but Justice spokesman
Brad Marman said the department always abides by court rulings.
   Although the Economic Powers Act containing the Nicaragua Trade
Control Regulations contains an exemption for humanitarian aid, the
Reagan administration had been interpreting it on a case-by-case
basis, and refusing to allow export of certain items including cars
and trucks, the court said.
   The Foreign Assets Control Office, part of the Treasury
Department, cited the act in June and July when it stopped the
Peace Convoy at the border and prevented its members from
continuing with a donation of vehicles to Nicaraguan schools,
hospitals and churches.
   The judge ruled that Foreign Assets Control, which wanted convoy
members to sign agreements that they would return the vehicles to
the United States within 30 days, ``may not regulate or prohibit,
directly or indirectly, such donations by requiring the donor to
seek and obtain a license prior to exportation.''
   Convoy spokesman Gerry Condon also welcomed the judge's ruling.
   ``It makes arbitrary regulation of aid impossible and it does in
a sense poke a hole in the embargo,'' Condon said. ``Ultimately, we
want to see the embargo lifted because it causes more suffering for
the people of Nicaragua than the Contra war.''
   The U.S. government has supported the Contra rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua.
   The Veterans Peace Convoy collected donations in 100 cities in
42 states last spring before converging in Laredo on June 7.
   After being repeatedly turned back by U.S. Customs at the Mexico
border, the convoy eventually was able to quietly take 32 of the
group's 38 vehicles across the border at Laredo in July and August.
Most of the vehicles now in Nicaragua, according to the court.

<HEAD>Singer John Denver Says Soviets Promise 1989 Space Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet space officials have promised John Denver
a chance to fly in their space program in December 1989, making a
seven-day visit to their space station Mir, the popular singer says.
   There is still a $10 million fee standing between Denver and the
trip, but that fee could be waived through the intercession of
politically powerful friends in the Soviet Union, Denver told the
Houston Chronicle in a telephone interview Friday.
   ``They told me I would have to make up my mind by November 1,
yea or nay, on whether I would pay them $10 million for my training
and housing and other needs for the trip into space,'' Denver said
from his home in Aspen, Colo.
   Denver said he wanted to conduct a television show from the Mir
``that I would host and would be broadcast all over the world.
   ``I want to talk to children all over the world,'' Denver said.
``... I think the next step is to have some experience of us as a
human family and a global community. And maybe my flight could be a
sign of that kind of experience.''
   Denver said the Soviets told him he could begin training for the
1989 mission in April or May of that year.
   The singer recently took a pre-flight physical at Johnson Space
Center and had a closed meeting with astronauts to explain why he
wants to fly in space.
   ``I'm not out for publicity,'' he said. ``But I think I have a
big enough voice to communicate things that should be done in
space.''
   In the past, he has not entirely ruled out paying the $10
million himself if that is the only way to go into space, but he
has said it would be a major obstacle to the trip.
   Denver said Friday that he thinks he has enough high-ranking
friends in the Soviet government to help him get around the $10
million payment that Glavkosmos, the civilian and commercial arm of
the Soviet space program, has asked him to pay.
   ``I met (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev on his visit to the
United States,'' Denver said, adding that his Soviet space venture
also had the approval of a leading Soviet space planetary scientist
who is a friend of Gorbachev's.
   Denver said U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer, who has close ties
to the Soviet government, also approved of his space venture.

<HEAD>Chiefs Say Code Of Machismo Led To Academy Dehydration Epidemic</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for AGAWAM, Mass.-dated story on AM-News Digest.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN LUMSDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Machismo and a curriculum that aims to
harden police officers to the stresses of their jobs may have been
behind last month's outbreak of illness among recruits at an
academy for local police forces.
   Sixteen recruits out of a class of 50 were hospitalized for
exhaustion and dehydration. Some needed kidney dialysis, and two
remained hospitalized Saturday, including one who had to have a
liver transplant and remained in a coma in critical condition.
   The state attorney general's office is investigating. Two state
troopers who were running physical and stress training for the
class deny mistreating the recruits but have been temporarily
reassigned at their own request.
   ``We categorically deny that we did anything that was not part
of the regular training regimen, and believe that we will be
vindicated by any objective investigation,'' the troopers, Blake
Gilmore and John Richardson, said in a statement.
   Doctors said the recruits suffered kidney failure and other
problems because of too much exercise and too little water.
   One recruit who dropped out of the program said they were given
only a small amount of water. Some officials theorized that
machismo may have kept cadets from asking for more.
   ``When you want to be a police officer, you've got a lot of
pride,'' said Pittsfield Chief William M. Dermody. ``I wouldn't go
to the bubbler first, either.''
   Gary Egan, executive director of the group that runs the state's
police academies, said last week, ``We have no one to date who was
denied permission to have water on request.''
   According to reports pieced together from recruits and police
chiefs, on the first day of class, Sept. 19, there were two breaks
for water in the morning at which the cadets were required to stand
in line and fill paper cups from a fountain.
   Some chiefs said they spoke about the academy off the record,
saying they feared state trooper instructors would take revenge on
their cadets. There has traditionally been tension between state
and local police in Massachusetts.
   ``It's a conspiracy of silence,'' said one of the nearly dozen
chiefs interviewed. ``I've got to send cadets down there and the
troopers will get 'em.''
   ``We don't buy that kind of excuse,'' Egan said about chiefs who
would talk only off the record. He is executive director of the
Criminal Justice Training Council, a group of 23 law enforcement
officials that runs the police academies.
   The ailments that struck the cadets might still be secret if not
for an anonymous caller who told The Associated Press on Sept. 22
to check on cadets in local hospitals and then hung up.
   Pittsfield Mayor Anne Wojtkowsi said she is seeking national
attention to the case so that there is ``no way the state can cover
up this thing.''
   The academy, one of five in the state, opened in 1984 to provide
training for officers in the 74 towns and cities of western
Massachusetts.
   The outbreak of illness was not the first time trouble has been
alleged at the academy. In previous years, one cadet claimed he was
hit with a club, another said she was taunted while her head was
shaved and another said he was forced to do pushups with a bucket
on his head.
   A member of the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination
looked into the academy four years ago, following discrimination
claims by two minority women.
   Commissioner Frederick Hurst said the women told the truth about
head shaving, humiliation and overexertion, but he denied they were
singled out for punishment.
   Michael Purcell dropped out of the academy and quit the
Northampton police force after watching Timothy Shepard collapse
from heat stroke Sept. 19.
   Purcell claimed troopers pushed cadets to the limits of their
endurance with pushups and laps and allowed them only a few small
cups of water until Shepard collapsed.
   Shepard, 25, of Pittsfield, underwent a liver transplant Tuesday
at a Pittsburgh hospital and remained in a coma Saturday.
   According to the chiefs and recruits, the cadets got an extended
water break after Shepard collapsed and was taken to a hospital.
But others who faltered were required to do more exercises, they
said.
   The Criminal Justice council's manual on stress training
recommends that troopers verbally abuse cadets for performance
failures and shout confusing orders.
   ``The cadets have to learn to control themselves and their
emotions so they can handle the street,'' said Judy Crossen,
director of training for the state's five regional police academies.
   Barbara Kopans, assistant secretary of public safety, said the
aim of the program was to condition recruits against overreacting.
   ``If they are eventually assigned to a riot situation, we don't
want them to overreact if someone is throwing rocks at them,'' she
said. ``We want them to learn not to let their anger carry them
away.''
   ``We are not doing it just to be mean. There is a reason for
it,'' she said.
   She said the physical training of the Agawam class has been put
on hold during the investigation, but the recruits are still
subject to verbal punishment and induced stress.
   Some military trainers say abuse is counterproductive. ``There
was a time when Army training was abusive,'' said Lt. Col. Gregory
Rixon, a Pentagon spokesman. ``That's gone by the wayside. There's
no use in calling somebody `maggot' or `meathead.'''
   Some of the western Massachusetts police chiefs who voted
unanimously in 1984 to support the academy's tough training say
they now wonder about the wisdom of the program.
   ``We don't need Marine Corps recruits,'' said one chief. ``We
need compassionate human beings trained to handle situations, and
you don't get that with a lot of Gestapo storm troopers humiliating
people.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis kept up his attack against George Bush
on the evironment Saturday, saying the Democrats would win the
White House and put an end to years of ``desecrating our heritage.''
   Republican Bush was taking the weekend off from campaigning
before flying to California on Monday to welcome back the space
shuttle and its astronauts.
   The vice presidential candidates, Sens. Lloyd Bentsen and Dan
Quayle, spent much of Saturday preparing for their only
face-to-face debate of the campaign, Wednesday night's nationally
televised confrontation in Omaha, Neb.
   A Quayle spokesman said the Indiana senator met with President
Reagan at the White House and later had a mock debate with Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., standing in for Bentsen. Spokesman David Prosperi
said of the meeting with Reagan, ``The senator was looking for
advice and counsel from the president who has participated in quite
a few presidential debates in his lifetime.''
   Bentsen spoke briefly to reporters in Washington after a
strategy session with four fellow Democrats in Congress. He said
simply, ``Their advice is to be myself'' in the debate.
   Former Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson urged a
crowd at a voter-registration rally in Chicago to support Dukakis
over Bush, whom he called ``mean-spirited.''
   Jackson said Bush's attacks on Dukakis for being a member of the
American Civil Liberties Union amounted to ``a back-handed swipe at
the entire civil rights community, not just the ACLU.''
   ``You see, Mr. Bush, you call people who fight for liberty
subversive,'' Jackson said, accusing Bush of being on an ``ugly and
mean side of history.''
   Dukakis was the only candidate on the campaign trail Saturday,
pledging at a rally near the Golden Gate Bridge to declare more
than half California's coastline ``marine sanctuaries'' to protect
it from offshore oil drilling.
   ``Our environment can't take four more years of damage and
neglect,'' Dukakis said. ``Starting on Jan. 20, 1989, we're going
to stop desecrating our heritage and start preserving and
protecting our environment once again.''
   Dukakis spoke while standing before fog-shrouded San Francisco
Bay and Golden Gate Bridge, addressing a crowd of 2,000 people or
more at a sandy stretch of U.S. Park Service-protected land.
   He has previously opposed offshore oil drilling in areas along
California's coast, and in the spring Bush changed his position to
back a temporary halt in the sale of drilling leases in sections of
the state. Aides said Dukakis does not oppose drilling in all areas
but in those deemed ``environmentally sensitive.''
   Dukakis renewed his blasts at Bush's environmental record,
saying the vice president had supported controversial Interior
Secretary James Watt, had supported vetoes of the Clean Water Act,
had fought to keep harmful lead in gasoline and ``still supports
drilling for offshore oil in the most environmentally sensitive
areas.''
   ``George Bush is trying to throw his environmental record
overboard in this campaign,'' Dukakis said. ``That's a case of
ocean dumping we're going to stop right now.''
   Dukakis said he would designate sanctuary along the coast from
Big Sur, south of Monterey, north to the Oregon border, an area
covering more than half the 1,200-mile shoreline that California
environmentalists have sought to have protected from drilling. He
also promised to consider portions of other coastal states.
   He has been focusing on the environment in his bid to become the
first Democrat since 1964 to carry California. On his last trip to
the state, Dukakis pledged to make the Environmental Protection
Agency a Cabinet department.
   The Massachusetts governor also has been critiized by Bush on
the environmental issue, in television ads blaming Dukakis for
pollution in Boston Harbor.
   Dukakis answered back in his speech, ``I'll tell you one kind of
garbage the people of Boston won't harbor _ and that's George
Bush's claim to be an environmentalist.''
   Earlier, Dukakis stopped at a children's soccer field in
Sacramento, where he talked with the kids and kicked a soccer ball,
kicking two balls into the goal and sailing one over it.
   Elsewhere in California, at Edwards Air Force Base, a Bush
campaign spokesman said the vice president wanted to be the first
person to greet the returning astronauts when they get out of the
space shuttle Discovery after landing there Monday.
   Bush figures to gain favorable publicity by his appearance at
the end of a space mission widely hailed by Americans. However, his
spokesman said Bush would be there by virtue of his office, not as
a candidate for the presidency.
   Bush himself said last week that inviting Dukakis to the event
would turn it into a political event.
   Dukakis declined to comment directly when asked about former CIA
Director Stansfield Turner's contention that Turner took Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Noriega off the agency's payroll when he took over from
Bush but that Bush reinstated Noriega after becoming vice president
in 1981.
   The Democrat did say, ``Maybe at the next debate we'll get a few
straight answers out of Mr. Bush'' about his relationship with
Noriega.
   Bush spokesman Steve Hart said Friday that Turner's allegation
that Bush had reinstated Noriega was ``absolutely untrue.''

   The information section in a new Yellow
Pages directory mislabels a couple of interstates, describes a
thousand-foot tower visible ``from miles away'' that in fact was
never built, and in general contains so many goofs that the
red-faced publishers are just going to start all over.
   ``We're not sure just what form it will take, but we will
reprint it in some way, shape or form,'' said Charles O. Yokum, a
spokesman for the Ameritech Publishing Co.
   ``We're in the community to stay, so we have to make it right
and fix it so these kinds of errors don't happen again,'' Yokum
said.
   The 56-page InfoPages section is in the front of the 900,000
newly printed Indianapolis Yellow Pages directories. Yokum figures
the cost of reprinting the section will be at least $100,000.
   The ``Things to See and Do'' section of the ``InfoPages''
contains the biggest error, or, at least, the tallest. It directs
visitors to Indiana Tower, and describes it in great detail.
   ``Rising to a height of 1,000 feet, it is the centerpiece of
White River State Park, a landmark attraction,'' the description
reads. The only problem is the tower was deleted from the original
plans for the park.
   The section also has mislabeled interstate highways and an
alphabetized directory of city and county streets with
corresponding maps that don't have grid letters and numbers.
   It defines the Indiana University Natatorium, the indoor
swimming and diving complex, as ``a track and field stadium with
numerous tennis courts and a bicycle racing track.''
   ``There are too many mistakes for us to live with,'' Yokum said.
``So we will do it no matter how much it costs.''

<HEAD>Jackson Attacks Bush's Comments on ACLU, Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson urged his supporters to vote for
fellow Democrat Michael Dukakis on Saturday, calling Republican
George Bush ``dangerous and mean-spirited'' and condemning Bush's
remarks about the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``You see, Mr. Bush, you call people who fight for liberty
subversive,'' Jackson said in remarks to about 1,000 people at a
voter registration rally at Operation PUSH headquarters. He said
the Republican presidential nominee was on an ``ugly and mean side
of history.''
   He said Bush's attacks on the organization are ``a back-handed
swipe at the entire civil rights community, not just the ACLU. ...
He was taking a back-handed swipe at the entire civil liberties
community.''
   ``There is something dangerous and mean-spirited about Bush,''
Jackson said.
   He also took Bush to task for the vice president's comments
during last Sunday's debate that many of the nation's homeless
people ``are mentally sick.''
   ``Bush assumes the homeless are homeless because something is
wrong with them emotionally,'' Jackson said, calling that ``a
contemptuous way the rich look down at the poor.
   ``I would remind Mr. Bush that Christmas, which we celebrate not
far from now, is not about big gifts for rich friends, it is not
about Santa Claus and reindeer. Christmas, Mr. Bush, is about a
homeless couple,'' Jackson said.
   Homeless people are simply poor and unemployed and need help,
the former Democratic candidate said.
   ``Mr. Bush turns his back on the homeless, following a tradition
of abandoning the homeless,'' Jackson said. ``The homeless are not
helpless and they must not be hopeless because they can hope. Hope
is on the way.''
   He said he supports Dukakis because there is a need to ``choose
a new direction'' in next month's presidential election.
   Jackson praised Dukakis' call for a national health insurance
program and criticized Bush for opposing it.
   ``When the president or vice president or the Supreme Court
justices or members of Congress get sick, the government takes them
to Walter Reed (Army hospital) and takes care of their medical
bills,'' he said.
   ``If it's good enough for the president, it's good enough for
all the people,'' Jackson said.

   Showers and thunderstorms developed Saturday along a weak
weather disturbance moving slowly across the Mississippi Valley,
and over the Southeast and the southern Plains.
   The showers and thunderstorms associated with the weak
disturbance extended from the central Gulf Coast to Indiana,
western Ohio and eastern Wisconsin.
   Thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain and a flash flood
watch was issued for southwestern Alabama.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered along the southern
Atlantic Coast, and across central Oklahoma and north-central
Texas. A thunderstorm in central Oklahoma produced hail the
diameter of nickels southwest of the town of Minco.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 96 at Palm Springs,
Calif. Saturday morning's low was 17 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
ahead of a cold front from the Gulf Coast region to the northern
Atlantic Coast states and the Great Lakes region.
   Highs only in the 50s were predicted from North Dakota to Upper
Michigan; below 70 from Montana through the northern and central
Plains to northern New England; in the 80s across much of the
nation west of the Rockies, and across southern Texas, the central
Gulf Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast states; and in the 90s
in the desert Southwest and the valleys of southern California,
with readings above 100 degrees at some locations.

   Police are looking for a man in a van who

the county on Long Island four times between Sept. 13 and Sept. 27,
Engles said.
   He has engaged the children in conversations, taken pictures of

   But during his conversations the blond man in his late 20s has

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitians and Western diplomats
Saturday praised the military government's unexpected ouster of a
powerful colonel who faces drug charges in the United States.
   The removal of Col. Jean-Claude Paul as commander of the feared
Dessalines Barracks could prompt Washington to resume $60 million
in annual aid. The funds were cut off after last year's
election-day massacre in which thugs believed to be supported by
Paul's soldiers killed 34 people at the polls.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said she was told Paul was
replaced by his second-in-command, Lt. Col. Guy Francois.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said
``recent developments, including the retirement of Col. Paul, are
steps in the right direction. The departure of Col. Paul in
particular will improve prospects for cooperation in anti-narcotics
efforts.
   ``Our objectives in Haiti remain the same: transition to a
freely elected government, respect for human rights, economic
justice and cooperation in anti-narcotics activities. Reinstatement
of aid continues to depend on concrete progress in all of these
areas,'' she said.
   Paul has been linked to the Tonton Macoutes, the hated personal
forces of the Duvalier dictatorship.
   In March, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in Miami on
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.
   Bursts of gunfire were heard late Friday night when the
government television announced Paul's forced retirement, but
Port-au-Prince was calm Saturday and it was quiet at the 700-man
Dessalines Barracks.
   ``A fine maneuver, a masterstroke,'' a Western diplomat said of
Paul's ouster. The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he was told Paul was no longer in the barracks, but his
whereabouts were not known.
   Also Saturday, members of the Presidential Guard appeared on
state television with four handcuffed men, accused by the soldiers
of being Tonton Macoutes
   The soldiers said the men participated in the Nov. 29 election
massacre with weapons personally supplied by Paul. All denied
participation in the massacre.
   Paul, very popular among his troops, was the only major unit
commander to remain in power following the Sept. 17 enlisted men's
coup that overthrew Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy and placed
Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power.
   Last week, the rank-and-file soldiers removed nearly 60
unpopular officers with ties to the Duvalier family regime.
   The television announcement said Paul's dismissal was signed by
Avril and Col. Carl Dorsainvil, minister of defense and interior.
   ``Perhaps his retirement is in response to the demands of the
Americans, but at the same time, there is a general cleanup in the
army,'' Communist Party leader Rene Theodore said Saturday.
   As head of the most brutal unit in Haiti's 7,000-member army,
Paul had been considered one of the most powerful figures in the
military. Soldiers who staged the coup against Namphy said they
wanted to name Paul armed forces chief, but decided not to because
of the drug charges.
   Haitian and diplomatic sources said Paul's ouster would likely
lead to renewed U.S. aid to Haiti. But the State Department has
conditioned a resumption of aid on democratic reforms and has said
Paul should answer the drug charges in court.
   Namphy reassigned Paul to an administrative position in June,
but Paul refused and was backed by President Leslie Manigat. Namphy
ousted Manigat, accusing him of meddling in army affairs, and Paul
remained head of his battalion. Paul did not intervene when
soldiers ousted Namphy on Sept. 17.
   Haitian politicians hailed the forced retirement after it was
announced Friday. They said it showed the 2-week-old government was
moving in the right direction.
   Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier ruled from 1957 until his death
in 1971, when his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, assumed
the presidency. On Feb. 7, 1986, after months of civil disorder,
Jean-Claude fled to exile in France.

   A white teen-ager was shot and seriously
injured by a black early Saturday in this city scarred by recent
race riots but police said they didn't think it was a racial
incident.
   Todd Spillers, 17, a sophomore at Woodlawn High School, was on a
respirator but improving in the intensive care unit at
Willis-Knighton Hospital, where he underwent surgery, said his
mother, Kathy Ellerd.
   Mrs. Ellerd said she was told that Spillers was shot by one of a
group of blacks who shouted ``This is for Hot Biscuit!'' as they
drove off.
   The Hot Biscuit Restaurant was the site of what police said was
an unprovoked racial shooting in August of a black teen-ager by a
young white man. One man has been charged with second-degree murder.
   Police said they did not believe race was the main reason
Spillers was shot, but would give little other information about
the case. No arrests had been made Saturday.
   ``I don't feel it was a racial incident at this point,'' Police
Sgt. Milton McGrew said early Saturday. ``It was just bad words
that had passed between them.''
   Mrs. Ellerd said her son and two other white youths were walking
to a store when a group of blacks drove by in a car, firing a shot
out of the window.
   ``Todd and his friends thought it was a blank or a capgun. They
didn't think anything about it,'' she said. ``The black boys
hollered something. I think Todd hollered something at them when
they were passing by. They went three blocks, turned around and
came back.''
   Mrs. Ellerd said the youths told her that blacks got out of the
back seat and the front passenger seat.
   ``There was talking or words or whatever. Someone hit Todd. From
what I understand, the next thing is that he was shot,'' she said
in a telephone interview from the hospital.
   Police said no additional information would be available until
public information officer Cindy Butts went on duty Monday. Her
telephone number could not be found through directory assistance,
and Chief Charles Gruber's number is unlisted.
   The neighborhood was at least 10 miles from the Cedar Grove
neighborhood where blacks rioted Sept. 20-21 after a white
teen-ager killed a black in what police said was a drug deal gone
sour. The young girl has been charged with second-degree murder in
that killing.

   Two men who admitted they attended
illegal cockfights at a ranch the night of a reported gang rape
have been charged with animal cruelty.
   Duval County Attorney Abelardo Garza said charges were filed
Thursday against Eloy Gonzalez and Jose Francisco Briones.
   In a cockfight, two roosters are outfitted with metal spurs,
pitted against each other and usually fight to the death.
   The men testified last week in the trial of Orlando Garza, 24,
who was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman the
night of March 26. The woman told police as many as 23 men raped
her that night on the hood of a car. Ten men have been charged in
the case.

   Saying ``the time is now,'' Mormon Church
President Ezra Taft Benson on Saturday challenged members to flood
the world with the message of the faith's most cherished scripture.
   Addressing the opening session of the church's 158th Semiannual
General Conference in halting phrases, the 89-year-old ``prophet,
seer and revelator'' of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints sounded what has been the theme of his three-year presidency.
   ``Now my good saints, we have a very great work to perform in a
very short time. We must flood the earth with the Book of Mormon _
and get out from under God's condemnation for having treated it
lightly,'' Benson said.
   Considered the ``keystone'' of the Mormon faith, the 531-page
volume was published by church founder Joseph Smith in 1830. Smith
said he translated the work from gold plates given him by an angel
named Moroni.
   The church's 6.5 million members believe the book is a history
of ancient peoples who came to the Americas from the Middle East
and were visited by a resurrected Jesus Christ shortly after his
crucifixion.
   ``I do not know fully why God has preserved my life to this age,
but I do know this: that for the present hour he has revealed to me
the absolute need for us to move the Book of Mormon forward now in
a marvelous manner,'' said Benson, who was U.S. secretary of
agriculture in the Cabinet of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   ``We have the Book of Mormon, we have the members, we have the
missionaries, we have the resources and the world has the need,''
he said. ``The time is now.''
   Benson acknowledged he was ``getting older and less vigorous,''
but expressed gratitude for the prayers and support of the
membership.
   His keynote address for the two-day conference in the 6,000-seat
Tabernacle on Temple Square was beamed by satellite to more than
2,000 chapels in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.
   During the afternoon session, Richard G. Scott was appointed a
member of the Council of the Twelve, an advisory body to the
governing First Presidency. He fills a vacancy created by the death
of Marion G. Romney, 90, president of the Twelve.
   Scott, 59, was a member of the presidency of the First Quorum of
the Seventy and executive director of the church's vast Family
History Department. J. Richard Clarke, a member of the Seventy, was
named to replace Scott.
   The First Presidency also added four members to the Seventy,
which assists the Twelve and supervises 35,700 full-time
missionaries. The five-year appointments of Monte J. Brough, Albert
Choules, Lloyd P. George and Gerald E. Melchin brought Seventy
membership to 66.
   Other members of the church's all-male hierarchy condemned drug
abuse, gambling, government-run lotteries and television
advertising for beer and wine coolers.
   Elder Russell M. Nelson said the worldwide plague of drug
addiction won't be eradicated by government or law, but by personal
commitment.
   ``The solution to this problem ultimately is neither
governmental nor institutional. Nor is it a question of legality.
It is a matter of individual choice and commitment,'' Nelson said.
   Mormons in good standing do not smoke or drink alcohol, tea or
coffee.

   Fledgling Tropical Storm Isaac lost its punch
Saturday and was downgraded to a depression, then a tropical wave,
prompting cancellations of storm warnings for six Caribbean islands.
   Isaac, which formed Friday in the tropical Atlantic just as
Hurricane Helene was reclassified as a bad storm in the far North
Atlantic, was clipped by strong winds in the upper atmosphere.
Those winds scattered Isaac's strength.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Isaac was classified a tropical wave after losing
its surface circulation. At noon, it was located about 770 miles
southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. The wave was moving toward the
west away from the Windward Islands, said forecasters at the
National Hurricane Center.
   But forecaster Bob Case said showers and thunderstorms could
dump heavy rains on parts of the Windward Islands through Saturday
night. He advised small craft in the Lesser Antilles to remain in
port until winds and seas subside.
   When Isaac weakened, tropical storm warnings were canceled for
the islands of Barbados, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, St. Lucia,
Dominica and Martinique. Trinidad and Tobago discontinued tropical
storm watches earlier Saturday.
   Also Saturday, forecasters were watching a westward-moving
tropical wave in the Atlantic midway between northwestern Africa
and the Lesser Antilles.
   Tropical waves become depressions if winds start moving in a
circular pattern around cores of low pressure. They become named
storms if winds hit 39 mph, and hurricanes if winds reach 74 mph.
Isaac was the ninth named storm of the six-month Atlantic hurricane
season, which started June 1.

   An 18-year-old student pilot took a small
airplane from an airport, landed it on a turnpike, then stole a car
in his attempts to flee police early Saturday morning, authorities
said.
   ``He didn't even solo yet,'' said Scott Buchanan of the novice
who took the two-seat Cessna from the flight school where Buchanan
is employed.
   The student, Douglas Ellison, of Lee, faces numerous charges,
including illegal use of an airplane, auto theft and resisting
arrest. He was released on bail on Saturday, police said.
   Police Officer Timothy Morgan, who arrested Ellison after
chasing him back to the airport, said the incident capped off a
three-week investigation at Allen Flying Service, which owned the
plane.
   The service had complained that someone was using its planes
after hours, he said.
   Morgan said he spotted the plane flying erratically during a
nighttime check at Skyhaven Airport in southeastern New Hampshire.
   He said Ellison landed at the airport, but apparently noticed
the police cruiser and started to take off again.
   Morgan said he chased the plane down the runway, driving
parallel to the plane and flashing his blue lights, but didn't
manage to prevent the escape.
   ``He must have at least read the (flight training) book,''
Buchanan said. ``That's not easy.''
   Police said they had to close part of the highway for half an
hour because of the incident. Ellison allegedly stole the car after
fleeing through a woods.

   The crew of the first shuttle flight in 32 months also tested an
infrared communications system designed to keep space snoops from
eavesdropping. Mission specialist George ``Pinky'' Nelson conducted
radio checks with the device throughout one orbit and his voice was
clearly heard in Mission Control.
   Earlier, Nelson and commander Frederick H. Hauck wormed their
way into bulky orange pressure suits designed to protect shuttle
astronauts who are forced to bail out of a disabled spacecraft.
   ``It's a struggle to get into these things,'' said Nelson after
he had donned his suit. ``It doesn't take very long. And they are
warm. No doubt about that.''
   On a televised view of the rehearsal, Nelson's face was streaked
with perspiration.
   Nelson also helped Hauck into his suit, while their crewmates,
pilot Richard Covey and mission specialists David Hilmers and John
M. Lounge, watched and timed their progress.
   In the television view, Hauck was seen to put on the bottom of
the suit both legs at a time, causing Covey to note, ``Oh, the
wonders of zero G (gravity).''
   Although the astronauts spent hours on Earth practicing with the
equipment, the suits had never been donned in the weightlessness of
space.
   Nelson also practiced installing a long, bulky pole that would
be used as a kind of fireman's slide to speed the crew's exit from
a disabled shuttle.
   The equipment was designed in the aftermath of the Challenger
explosion, although it would not have helped the seven crew members
who died when that shuttle blew up on Jan. 28, 1986. The system,
which includes explosives to blow open a hatch, gives astronauts an
escape if the craft is in stable, gliding flight but unable to make
a runway landing.
   Mission Control reported that Discovery continued to function
smoothly as it flashed past the halfway mark of a four-day flight.
The first shuttle mission since Challenger is to end on Monday at
12:33 p.m. EDT when Discovery touches down at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.
   Flight controller Milton Heflin said experts were studying a
balky cabin cooling system that iced up shortly after launch.
Mission Control turned on heaters to thaw the ice away, but Heflin
said even if the problem persisted there was another system that
could keep the cabin cool during its return to Earth.
   Cabin temperatures have hovered in the 80s while the ice has
been thawing, but Heflin said the crew appeared to be comfortable.
   Earlier, Hauck took television time to read what he called a
``particularly meaningful'' letter from Phillip J. ``P.J.'' Morgan,
a Brooklyn, N.Y. high school student.
   In the letter, the student described himself as a ``worried
14-year-old that is worried about the future.''
   ``I feel some of America's future is riding on you and your
crew's shoulders,'' the letter said.
   Hauck said he called Morgan before Discovery's launch on
Thursday and said the youth was concerned ``whether we were still
capable of doing the things that make us a great country.'
   The astronaut said he hopes youngsters everywhere ``can see we
are back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits that
will come in the future.''
   Discovery's astronauts were awakened at 4:37 a.m. EDT when
Mission Control radioed a Beach Boys tune that included lyrics
adapted for the space travelers:
   ``'Round, 'round. We orbit 'round. And we're going to town.
   ``Well, we're racking up the miles with a whole lot of power.
We're going seventeen thousand, five hundred an hour.''
   The wireless intercom system that Nelson tested operates through
the use of invisible infrared lights that are pulsed by the spoken
voice. Receivers detect the light pulses and convert them back to
sound, providing wireless, invisible communications.
   Engineers developed the system to avoid the possibility that
radio intercom talk inside the shuttle could escape to space and be
picked up by spy satellites. Secure communications are a concern of
the Department of Defense since the shuttle is increasingly to be
used for secret Air Force missions.
   The astronauts also helped Reagan keep a promise by operating
new versions of two student experiments that were destroyed on
Challenger.
   One was designed by Richard S. Cavoli, a student mentioned by
Reagan during his 1986 State of the Union address. In the speech,
Reagan promised Cavoli that the experiment destroyed on Challenger
would fly on a later shuttle mission.
   Cavoli's experiment consisted of tubes that contained two
chambers separated by a membrane. In one end of the tubes was lead
acetate and in the other a solution of potassium iodide. When the
fluids were allowed to meet at the membrane, they were expected to
form crystals of lead iodide.
   Nelson operated the experiment and after just five minutes
reported, ``the crystals are going at a good rate.''
   A closeup television view showed a grouping of yellow crystals
clustered on the membrane.
   Cavoli created the experiment while a student at Central High
School in Marlboro, N.Y. He now is a medical student at the State
University of New York in Buffalo.
   Lounge operated an experiment that had been devised for
Challenger by Lloyd C. Bruce, a St. Louis student.
   Bruce designed a small furnace to test the effects of
weightlessness on melted titanium, a metal used in airplanes and
atomic power plants.
   A close television view beamed from Discovery showed wires of
titanium glowing brightly, one by one, as Lounge turned on the
power. As planned, two of the wires melted, then broke.
   Bruce, now a senior at the University of Missouri, watched the
performance of the experiment from Mission Control and said it went
as planned. Bruce devised the experiment while a student at Sumner
High School in St. Louis.
   Engineers and scientists are interested in the effects of
weightlessness on melted metals because of the theory that the
absence of gravity may cause the molten metal to cool with larger
crystals. This would give more strength to the material.

<TEXT>
   Muriel Snowden, co-founder of the non-profit
Freedom House that pushed for integration and self-help in Boston's
predominantly black Roxbury section, has died at the age of 72.
   Mrs. Snowden, who died at home Friday night of cancer, won a
prestigious MacArthur Foundation grant last year.
   She and her husband, Otto, began Freedom House in 1949 after
calling 17 people to their home to confer about how black and white
residents could unite on common problems.
   They ran the organization from their home for three years, then
bought a building that had been a church and a teachers college.
   When the Snowdens retired in 1984, they had made Freedom House a
catalyst for urban renewal, job fairs, affirmative action and
innovative school programs. They were also a force for calm during
the school integration crisis of the 1970s.
   ``The work of an organization like ours is never done,'' Mrs.
Snowden once said.
   In June 1987, she was one of 32 people awarded ``no strings''
grants by the John D. and Catherine T. MarArthur Foundation.
Fellows receive annual stipends for a five-year period, ranging
from $30,000 to $75,000 a year.
   In June, the Boston School Committee voted to rename a high
school in her honor.
   Mrs. Snowden is survived by her husband, a daughter and a
granddaughter.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose son and daughter-in-law returned
from the Soviet Union last week said Saturday the couple plans to
move back to Moscow because they believe U.S. officials have
mistreated them.
   ``They are going back because of the lies that have been told,''
said Lavera Branch.
   Theodore and Cheryle Branch, after suffering financial setbacks
in Pennsylvania and Florida, moved to Moscow 10 months ago. They
said Soviet officials gave them a furnished apartment, jobs and
medical benefits.
   They said they were enticed to return to the United States by
U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow who promised to give them a place
to live, find jobs for them and reimburse $3,000 in travel
expenses. They also said the embassy offered help enforcing a court
judgment awarding them eight weeks' back wages from a Florida
broadcaster.
   But the State Department said no such promises were made.
   They plan to talk with Soviet officials in Washington, D.C., to
discuss entering the Soviet Union again, Lavera Branch said.
   Theodore and Cheryle Branch could not be reached Saturday at the
motel where they have been staying. Last week, Branch said the
couple might return to the Soviet Union but they were ``tired of
moving back and forth across the ocean at somebody's whim.''
   Branch's mother said the couple has been harassed by neighbors
about their decision to live in the Soviet Union.
   ``I'm afraid some people turned against them,'' she said. ``They
just take for granted that people who go to Russians are no good.
It's like we've all been brainwashed to believe that all the
Russians are terrible. But they're nice people just like
Americans.''

<HEAD>Brawley Advisers Call News Leak Illegal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a black teen-ager said Saturday
that it was illegal to publish information leaked from a grand jury
investigating the girl's reported kidnap and rape.
   Attorney Alton H. Maddox Jr. contended at a news conference that
news organizations can be prosecuted for possession and publication
of grand jury materials.
   Special State Prosecutor Charles J. Hynes, who is investigating
the leak, said Friday that he would try to speak informally to
reporters for The New York Times, but that he would not force them
to talk if they invoke the privilege provided journalists under the
state's shield law.
   Maddox referred to an article Tuesday in the Times, which was
based on evidence summaries from the special grand jury in Dutchess
County investigating the reported kidnap and rape of Tawana Brawley
in Wappinger Falls.
   It said that state investigators have concluded Miss Brawley
lied about being abducted and sexually assaulted by white men last
November.
   ``On behalf of Ms. Tawana Brawley and (her mother) Ms. Glenda
Brawley, I am demanding the immediate arrest of The New York Times
Co. and all journalists whose names appear on an article entitled,
`Evidence Points to Deceit by Brawley,''' Maddox wrote in a letter
to Hynes.
   The newspaper would have no immediate comment, said an editor
who asked that his name not be used.
   Miss Brawley, 16, and her mother refused to cooperate with
prosecutors. Maddox and the family's other advisers accused state
and local officials of engaging in a cover-up, without providing
evidence to back up their claims.

<TEXT>
   A 76-year-old woman has opened her eyes for
the first time since Aug. 31, when surgeons put her in a coma and
stopped her heart to remove an egg-sized aneurysm near her brain.
   Cecilia Duffy of Pittsburgh has been comatose since the
operation, during which surgeons reduced her body temperature by 40
degrees, drained her blood and placed her in a sort of suspended
animation that lets surgeons cure high-risk aneurysms once
considered inoperable.
   The early signs of eye movement came last weekend and by week's
end therapists reported Duffy is ``holding her head up and she's
tracking with her eyes,'' said Dr. Julian E. Bailes, a neurosurgeon
at Allegheny General Hospital.
   Bailes said the development does not mean Duffy is en route to a
full recovery. He said she may continue to improve in coming months
or may show no further change.
   ``She has suffered some neurologic injury,'' Bailes said. While
a return to her previously independent lifestyle is possible,
Bailes said, ``at this point I wouldn't bet on it.''
   Within the next several days, Duffy is expected to begin
rehabilitative therapy designed to help the injured brain heal.

<HEAD>Mulroney Calls Elections In Bid To Save Free-Trade Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS one graf to include Senate appoinment process; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Saturday
dissolved Parliament and announced elections Nov. 21 in a bid to
keep alive his free-trade agreement with the United States.
   Mulroney is gambling that his majority Progressive Conservative
government will be the first to return with a majority since the
Liberals did it in 1953.
   ``I invite Canadians to judge our record,'' he said outside
Government House after consulting with Governor General Jeanne
Sauve.
   Flanked by three Maple Leaf flags, he promised the Progressive
Conservatives will offer ``an agenda of confidence for Canada,''
with the free-trade pact ``very much a centerpiece'' of the
campaign.
   The main opposition Liberals and the socialist New Democratic
Party oppose the trade agreement and say it would destroy Canada's
sovereignty.
   Liberal Leader John Turner welcomed Mulroney's announcement. He
accused Mulroney of trying to make Canada ``a colony of the United
States'' with the plan.
   ``We're going to be saying to Canadians: This is more than an
election, this is your future,'' Turner said.
   Turner's Liberals control the unelected Senate and have been
blocking the free-trade deal there. The agreement has been passed
by the House of Commons but must get Senate approval before taking
effect.
   Turner has promised the Senate blockade will be lifted if
Mulroney wins a majority in the election for the 295 seats in the
Commons.
   Mulroney had been waiting for an encouraging sign before calling
the election. The sign came Thursday with the release of a poll
indicating the Conservatives with 40 percent support, compared with
31 percent for the Democrats and 26 percent for the Liberals.
   Mulroney began his fourth year in office on Sept. 17, and under
the Constitution, could have served five years.He became leader of
his party in 1983 and scored a landslide victory in 1984.
   In the last election, the Conservatives won 204 seats in the
Commons. The Liberals had 38, the Democrats 32, Independents 3,
Independent Liberals 1, and four seats were vacant. Because of
redistribution, 13 seats will be added for the November election.
   If Mulroney wins in November, the world's two largest trading
partners will proceed with plans to create a North American free
trade zone on Jan. 1. The pact will eliminate tariffs and a number
of other trade curbs over 10 years.
   If Mulroney loses, the Liberals and the Democrats, led by Ed
Broadbent, say they will tear up the deal.
   The trade agreement was approved by the U.S. Senate on Sept. 19
and signed by President Reagan but remains frozen until Canada's
Senate also passes it.
   Mulroney said the agreement would create more jobs in Canada.
   During his speech Saturday, he also called for an agreement with
the United States to cut emissions that cause acid rain, and he
urged a nationwide effort to curb pollution in Canada.
   In addition to he free-trade deal, other issues expected to
dominate the election include integrity in government. Mulroney
faced a number of scandals involving cabinet ministers and party
members.
   Jobs will likely be a major issue. Since Mulroney came to power,
the Conservatives say 1.3 million jobs have been created. The
opposition says the figures were doctored to make it look as if job
creation worked.
   All candidates are likely to be hounded by the issue of
abortion, made legal in January when the nation's Supreme Court
struck down the existing law restricting access to abortion as
unconstitutional.
   Neither Mulroney nor Turner has a clear-cut position on the
matter. Broadbent believes abortion is a woman's right.
   Senate members are appointed by the Governor General who, by
constitutional convention, acts on the advice of the prime
minister. Senate seats are apportioned on a regional basis.

   Hundreds of thousands of people jammed a
broad avenue Saturday to call for the rejection of President
Augusto Pinochet in a nationwide referendum this week.
   Organizers said 1.2 million people packed a working class
neighborhood about five miles south of the center of Santiago for
the demonstration marking the official close of the opposition's
campaign.
   After the rally ended, small groups marched downtown and clashed
with police, who dispersed them with water cannons. Police said
more than 20 people were arrested.
   Police did not give an estimate of the size of the crowd at the
rally, but reporters on the scene said it was in excess of 350,000.
   Chileans are to vote Wednesday to approve or reject Pinochet,
the 72-year-old president and army commander who seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup. Elected President Salvador Allende, a Marxist,
was ousted and died in the coup.
   Pro- and anti-government forces have been waging ardent but
relatively peaceful campaigns.
   The opposition gathering was the largest of the campaign and one
of the biggest gatherings in memory in Chile. Long columns of
people marched from various points of the city, many carrying
Chilean flags and opposition signs and chanting anti-government
slogans.
   Patricio Aylwin, leader of a 16-party coalition opposing
Pinochet in the referendum, told the festive rally that an
opposition victory would pave the way to ``a peaceful, fast and
orderly transition to democracy'' after 15 years of military rule.
   Aylwin called on the military to ``facilitate the respect to the
people's will,'' if the opposition wins the presidential vote.
   He promised that if the government wins and the vote is fair,
the opposition will accept the result.
   ``We are going to win, and that will bring us democracy,'' said
Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic party.
   If a majority approve Pinochet as president, he will begin a new
eight-year term in March. If he is rejected, democratic elections
are to take place in December 1989, with Pinochet remaining in
power until a new president takes office.
   In either case, elections for congress, suspended since 1973,
are planned for 1990.
   Virtually all opposition figures from left to right attended the
rally, including Hotensia Bussi de Allende, widow of the former
president.
   Pinochet on Saturday traveled to the agricultural city of
Rancagua, 50 miles south of Santiago, and led a rally by thousands
of supporters in a local stadium.
   At the stadium he told the crowd the opposition was directed by
``the same people who in the past tried to destroy the patrimony
and who halted our development, relegating thousands of Chilean to
poverty.''
   The government forces were preparing their own campaign closing
rally for Sunday in Santiago. According to election law, all
campaign activities must cease by midnight Sunday.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday denied a
report that President P.W. Botha had promised the unconditional
release of jailed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   Roland Darroll, a spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Department,
disputed a French news report that quoted President Mobutu Sese
Seko of Zaire as saying Botha made the promise during the two
leaders' summit meeting Saturday in northern Zaire.
   Darroll said Mobutu, if quoted properly, was overstating the
gist of the summit discussion and ``may not have appreciated the
qualifications'' set out by Botha regarding Mandela.
   Botha has frequently said he would release Mandela in exchange
for a renunciation of violence. Mandela, currently in a clinic in
Cape Town recuperating from tuberculosis, has refused to repudiate
the violent tactics of the outlawed anti-apartheid movement he led
before his imprisonment in 1962.
   Darroll, speaking by telephone from Pretoria, noted that Mobutu
and Botha has issued a joint communique which said that Mobutu
``was encouraged by the flexible approach taken by President
Botha'' regarding Mandela's release.
   Mandela, 70, is widely considered the most popular leader among
South Africa's disenfranchised black majority.
   Since his hospitalization for tuberculosis in August, there has
been speculation that the government might free him even without an
explicit renunciation of violence.
   The joint communique issued by Botha and Mobutu also touched on
another major political controversy in South Africa, the fate of a
group of black prisoners on death row known as the Sharpeville Six.
   According to the communique, Botha reiterated that would
consider granting clemency to the six, but only after completion on
an ongoing appeal process.
   The six, five men and a woman, were sentenced to hang for
complicity in the 1984 mob killing of a black township official.
   The case has stirred controversy because a key state witness now
claims he was coerced by police into giving false testimony and
because there was no evidence the six contributed physically to the
death. They were convicted under the doctrine of ``common
purpose,'' which held them responsible because they allegedly were
active participants in the mob.
   Botha, on his return flight from Zaire, told reporters he
planned more diplomatic initiatives in Africa this year but
declined to give specifics.
   ``Africa is talking to South Africa,'' he said.

   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire met
Saturday with South African President P.W. Botha in Mobutu's
ancestral village and agreed to visit South Africa soon.
   After two hours of talks at Mobutu's palace near the border of
the Central African Republic, the Zairean leader told reporters he
accepted Botha's invitation to visit South Africa.
   ``Our relations are on a new path,'' Mobutu said, adding they
talked ``frankly and in great depth.''
   No black African leader has gone to South Africa since Botha
took power of the white-controlled government in 1978. No date was
set for the visit.
   Botha said he was ``most impressed'' with Mobutu's knowledge of
southern Africa affairs, calling the get-together ``a most
successful morning.''
   On his return flight to South Africa, Botha told reporters he
planned more diplomatic initiatives in Africa this year.
   ``Africa is talking to South Africa,'' said Botha.
   A joint statement released after the meeting said the two also
discussed jailed black South African activist Nelson Mandela and
the fate of six black South Africans facing the death penalty in
the 1984 mob killing of a black township official.
   Roland Darroll, a South African Foreign Affairs Department
spokesman, denied a report that Mandela was about to be released.
The report, from the French news agency Agence France-Presse,
quoted Mobutu Saturday as saying he had obtained Mandela's
``liberation, soon and without conditions.''
   Mandela, 70, leader of the anti-apartheid African National
Congress, was sentenced to life in prison in June 1964. Botha has
said he would release Mandela if he renounces violence, and Mandela
has refused.
   The statement also said Botha reiterated to Mobutu that he would
consider granting clemency to the six jailed South Africans, who
critics say have been wrongly implicated in the slaying, but only
after the appeals process is completed.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp., meanwhile, reported Mobutu
and the leaders of Gabon, Congo, Angola and Zambia planned to meet
in the Zambian capital of Lusaka on Thursday, apparently to discuss
developments in the Angolan war.
   In Kinshasa, the Zairean capital700 miles to the southwest,
where Botha's plane stopped to refuel, troops opened fire on about
200 students demonstrating at the University of Kinshasa against
his visit.
   Witnesses said at least two students were injured, one struck in
the neck by a bullet and another hit in the leg. Both were taken to
the university clinic for treatment but their conditions were not
known.
   The meeting was Botha's first with Mobutu and his third summit
in black Africa during his 10 years in power _ all of them the past
three weeks.
   On Sept. 13, Botha met with President Joaquim Chissano of
Mozambique, a longtime adversary of South Africa. The next day he
visited President Kamuzu Banda of Malawi, the only African country
to maintain full diplomatic relations with Pretoria.
   One of Botha's foreign policy goals has been to broaden ties
with black Africa without having to make substantive political
concessions to the disenfranchised black majority in his own
country.
   Botha told reporters he and Mobutu spoke about the latest round
of U.S.-mediated talks in the Congolese capital of Brazzaville,
aimed at a peace agreement between South Africa and Angola.
   ``We discussed peace in Africa and in southern Africa
especially. We discussed the Angolan question, which is of vital
importance to all of us, and we discussed the South-West Africa,
Namibia problem which is being dealt with in the near future,''
Botha said.
   Despite the lack of formal relations, Zaire and many other
African countries trade with South Africa and rely on its ports and
railroad lines for handling imports and exports.
   South African products are sold in Zaire, and more than a third
of Zaire's main export, copper, is routed through South Africa.
   The Brazzaville talks between South Africa and an Angolan-Cuban
delegation adjourned Thursday without agreement on a timetable for
withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola
supporting the government.
   South Africa has offered to begin implementation on Nov. 1 of a
United Nations plan for independence for South-West Africa, or
Namibia, if a Cuban withdrawal from Angola can be negotiated.

educators and an Indian instructor said Saturday they will release
one hostage to increase U.S. support for Palestinians in the
Israeli-ocupied territories.
   The announcement came in a handwritten statement in Arabic from
a group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.
   The statement did not identify the hostage to be freed nor set a
specific deadline for his release.
   ``We shall free one of the hostages. It's a difficult decision
for us, but we shall ascertain our good intentions and our
seriousness in this matter,'' the statement said.
   ``This should be a clear signal for Washington to carry out what
it should do in the area'' to support the 10-month Palestinian
uprising against the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, the statement added.
   It said the group's decision to free one hostage was designed to
``win more public sympathy for the uprising of our people to wrest
their rights.''
   The four hostages being held by the group are Alann Steen, 49, a
journalism teacher; Jesse Turner, 41, a professor of mathematics
and computer science; Robert Polhill, 55, a lecturer in accounting;
and Indian Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a professor of finance and a
legal resident alien of the United States.
   They were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the campus of the
U.S.-affiliated Beirut University College by gunmen posing as
police.
   The 22-line statement from Islamic Jihad was accompanied by a
photograph showing Steen and Turner with their arms around each
other and holding cigarettes.
   It was the fourth statement on the four hostages since Sept. 15
from the group, which is believed made up of Shiite Moslem zealots
loyal to Iran and sympathetic to Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The first statement said the kidnappers were willing to free the
four if the United States undertook an initiative in support of the
Palestinian uprising.
   The following two expressed dismay at the U.S. failure to
declare outright support for the Palestinian right to
self-determination.
   There are 17 foreigners believed held in Lebanon, including nine
Americans. Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   The statement on Saturday also said: ``The American
administation is still denying the simplest human values toward our
people. We have repeatedly stated our demand in this regard and we
want public opinion and the international community to record this
American precedent.
   ``But in spite of everything, we are determined and shall go
ahead with our initiative and plan to resolve this problem.
However, the continuation of progress is linked to the emergence of
new and positive elements in the Middle East.
   ``Finally, we call on the families of the hostages to come to
Lebanon to participate in the festivity of the release of the
hostage.''
   Three of the hostages' wives currently are living at the Beirut
University College and Mrs. Steen, now in the United States, said
she was planning to leave Wednesday for Beirut to return to her
teaching job there.
   Steen's wife called the report ``the most wonderful thing in the
world.
   ``I'm sitting on pins and needles right now,'' Mrs. Steen, 32,
said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in New York
from her hometown of Clark Lake, Mich.
   Turner's Lebanese wife, Badr, said, ``We hope all of them are
going to be released. ...I hope they're going to be released soon.''

<HEAD>Resigns from Yugoslavia's Presidium Membership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former president of the Yugoslav
communist party resigned from the party Presidium on Saturday and
said he was unhappy with the simmering ethnic unrest over a
disputed province.
   The resignation of Bosko Krunic was reported by the official
Tanjug news agency. It is the second time a top Yugoslav official
has stepped down recent days.
   The changes appear to boost the chances of Serbia's hard-line
party chief Slobodan Milosevic in his bid to gain tighter control
over the republic's two autonomous provinces, Vojvodina and Kosovo.
   Krunic, 59, was known to have opposed Milosevic's centralist
plans.
   Franc Setinc, a member of the 23-man top party body, resigned
Monday after warning against ``the destructive avalanche engulfing
the country.''
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have demonstrated in recent weeks in
support of Milosevic's drive. More rallies were reported Saturday.
   Krunic, who held the rotating one-year post as president of the
ruling League of Communists until July, told a Presidium session on
Saturday that in recent months he was ``exposed to many
unprincipled hecklings and unsubstantiated charges, including
slanders in some (Yugoslav) media and at public rallies,'' Tanjug
said.
   As a former party leader, he felt responsible for the
``unsuccessful settlement of acute problems in (Yugoslav) society
and for inadequate results in the work of the Presidium,'' Tanjug
quoted Krunic as saying.
   Krunic said he was displeased with the daily rallies held in
Serbia, where Slavs were protesting alleged ethnic Albanian
harassment in the restive province of Kosovo, which borders Albania.
   Most of the Slavs are Christian while most Kosovo Albanians, who
make up 90 percent of the population in that province, are Moslem.
   
   Milosevic' opponents claim he is using the rallies to further
his plans for control over the autonomous provinces.
   The split in the top Yugoslav leadership over possible solutions
to end ethnic strife in Kosovo is expected to dominate a meeting of
the party's Central Committee set for Oct. 17.

   Emperor Hirohito received a blood transfusion after
suffering more internal bleeding Sunday, but doctors said the
87-year-old monarch's condition was stable.
   The tranfusion was the second since Hirohito's condition
suddenly deteriorated Saturday, when worsening internal bleeding
caused his blood pressure to plummet.
   Relatives rushed to his bedside, but his condition stabilized
after a transfusion on Saturday, doctors said.
   The Imperial Household Agency said that the emperor was given
another 0.4-pint transfusion Sunday after discharging a ``small
amount'' of blood through his bowels.
   The palace reported that as of 9:00 a.m. (8 p.m. EDT) the
world's oldest monarch was resting and in stable condition, with
his temperature only slightly above normal.
   The setback on Saturday came hours after doctors fed Hirohito
some porridge, his first food in nearly two weeks. Court officials
said then his condition was moving ``in a very good direction.''
   
   But Hirohito suddenly discharged a large volume of blood from
his bowels, and his blood pressure dropped dangerously for about 30
minutes, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
Officials said the discharge was not related to the food.
   Crown Prince Akihito, Crown Princess Michiko and other court
officials were summoned to the Imperial Palace in a sudden flurry
of activity seen by reporters stationed there since Sept. 19, when
Hirohito vomited blood from an intestinal hemorrhage.
   Prince Aya, Akihito's second son, arrived in Tokyo after being
called back from his studies at Oxford University in England and
immediately visited his grandfather.
   Hirohito's blood pressure and pulse returned to previous levels
after doctors gave him an emergency blood transfusion of 1.3 pints,
followed by another transfusion of 0.4 pints, Maeda said.
   ``Something that we hoped wouldn't occur did occur,'' chief
imperial physician Akira Takagi said. ``But the emperor's body
responded quickly to the emergency blood transfusion. As chief
physician, I can relax a bit now since his condition has
stabilized.''
   Saturday's transfusions brought the total amount of blood
Hirohito has received since Sept. 19 to 9.8 pints, more than his
body's normal total, news reports said.
   Doctors are worried that the volume of transfusions needed to
compensate for Hirohito's internal bleeding may have side effects.
They say is losing strength because intraveneous feeding alone
cannot supply enough nutrients.
   Other than five or six spoonfuls of porridge Saturday morning
and two small ice cubes more than a week ago, the emperor has been
unable to eat or drink since the crisis began.
   Newspapers reported Saturday that palace doctors also were
worried about Hirohito's worsening jaundice and said his hands and
feet were swollen because of a malfunctioning kidney.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper, said doctors
feared his internal bleeding spread from the intestine to other
organs.
   Several news reports have said Hirohito has cancer of the upper
intestine. Palace officials have refused to comment and urged the
media to refrain from speculation.
   Maeda said Hirohito's temperature Saturday evening was 99.5,
compared with his normal reading of about 95.9. His pulse was 84
and his blood pressure 142 over 72, he said. Both levels were
similar to those before Saturday's bleeding.
   Under the Constitution, the emperor is a symbol of the state
with little real power. His duties include receiving foreign
dignitaries and placing official seals on government documents.

   A band of student protesters set fire
to an Olympic welcoming sign with firebombs and fled before police
could catch them, a news report said Sunday.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said several protesters
hurled about 10 firebombs at the 23-foot-high welcoming sign in
front of a government building in western Seoul late Saturday night.
   The billboard collapsed after it was damaged by fire.
   The attack followed a brief street demonstration by some 30
students several blocks from the sign, denouncing the Olympics
under way in Seoul as ``divisive,'' the report said.
   Tight security is in force in Seoul after a radical student
group threatened to disrupt the Olympics unless a jailed leader is
released. The Games end Sunday.
   The Seoul Olympics have attracted a record 160 countries,
including most communist-bloc nations, but radical students have
demonstrated against the Games because North Korea is boycotting
them.
   Communist North Korea, a bitter rival of South Korea, is
boycotting the Olympics after its demand to co-host the Games was
rejected by the International Olympic Committee. The IOC said the
Olymics are awarded to a single city and cannot be shared.

   Iran and Iraq resumed peace talks
Saturday, and Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar offered new
proposals to break a stalemate over navigation rights, a senior
European diplomat said.
   The talks lasted about four hours and concluded at about 10 p.m.
Diplomats said the sides remained deadlocked over the crucial
Shatt-al-Arab waterway and Iran's policy of searching ships for
Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said the sides would
meet again on Monday. He said negotiators were discussing the
provision in a U.S. cease-fire accord that calls for Iran and Iraq
``to withdraw all forces to the internationally recognized borders
without delay.''
   A spokesman for the Iraqi delegation said the talks were ``still
on square one.
   ``There was no tangible progress in the Iranian position'' since
Aug. 25th, when the talks began in Geneva, he added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   U.N. spokeswoman Nadia Younes said Perez de Cuellar will contact
both delegations Monday about holding separate talks.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz had no comment upon his
departure, and Perez de Cuellar left by a separate exit, avoiding
reporters.
   The Iranians and Iraqis were in separate rooms and Perez de
Cuellar shuttled between them with proposals and counterproposals.
   Aziz and Velyati met separately Friday evening with Perez de
Cuellar and his special mediator, Swedish U.N. Ambassador Jan K.
Eliasson.
   The major issue separating the two sides is the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, which forms the nations' southern border.
   When talks broke off Sept. 13 in Geneva, Iraq was insisting that
the Shatt-al-Arab be cleared of sunken ships and silt to be made
navigable again. The waterway is Iraq's only outlet to the Persian
Gulf.
   Iraq also wanted Iran to cease halting neutral ships in the gulf
to inspect them for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   The Geneva talks opened Aug. 25, five days after a truce in the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war began.
   Perez de Cuellar has advanced new proposals to break the
stalemate, said Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, chairman
of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the 12 European Community
nations.
   ``Efforts have been undertaken on the part of the
secretary-general to resolve the deadlock that has evolved in that
area, and always there is hope that the deadlock will be
overcome,'' Papoulias said Friday after meeting Aziz and Velayati.
   ``After so many years of war, the issues cannot be overcome from
one day to another,'' he said.
   Aziz said he was hopeful of a breakthrough but offered no
specific reason for his optimism.
   Velayati told reporters: ``We do hope that during these talks
that are taking place in New York, we could reach a tangible
result, and we hope that we could reach a concrete conclusion for
the implementation of the other provisions of Resolution 598.''
   Resolution 598, passed last year by the U.N. Security Council,
calls for a cease-fire, the exchange of war prisoners and a return
to international borders.
   Iraq has agreed to only one negotiating session in New York and
wants the talks shifted back to Geneva.

<HEAD>Convicted Smuggler To Open AIDS Hospice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge with a tough reputation
has tentatively agreed to let a man who helped import 11 tons of
marijuana to run a hospice for AIDS patients in lieu of a maximum
15-year prison sentence.
   U.S. District Judge Gene Carter said he would agree to the
alternative sentence for Harvey Prager pending submission of
additional papers from attorneys. He set sentencing for Oct. 7.
   Carter has a reputation for imposing severe sentences in drug
cases. And Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Groff III said the
judge had accepted alternative sentencing only a few times and
``never to this magnitude.''
   But then, ``no one has ever volunteered to live in an AIDS
hospice, either,'' said Groff, who recommended a prison term.
   Carter tentatively accepted Prager's proposal to open an AIDS
hospice and act as resident manager, with his wife, for five years,
after hearing several witnesses who work on AIDS projects in Maine.
   The judge said he had thought more about Prager than he had
about any other defendant during his years on the bench. He called
his decision ``supremely difficult.''
   Prager, 41, of Yarmouth, helped smuggle marijuana into Maine at
Little Deer Isle during the summers of 1979, 1980 and 1981. He was
arrested in London last fall and was returned to Maine, where he
pleaded guilty in January to charges of conspiracy, possession and
importation of marijuana.
   Prager's involvement in smuggling was a ``very serious offense
against basic human decency,'' Carter said.
   No one could answer the question of whether it is ``an
acceptable trade-off'' to permit someone to do something good for
society, rather than go to prison, the judge said.
   Carter questioned several people who appeared in court on
Prager's behalf.
   ``If I have anything to do with it, he will not fail,'' said Dr.
Michael Bach, an AIDS specialist at Maine Medical Center. ``We are
in desperate need of a hospice, and we will have one within six
months'' if Prager were allowed to proceed.
   Prager has been working with Bach to help terminally ill AIDS
patients.
   Carter said he was concerned about how the public would view
Prager's atonement for such a serious crime. But Dr. Owen B.
Pickus, also an AIDS specialist in Portland, said the public
``would not view this is an easy-out option.''
   The judge also asked Prager why he should not go to jail.
   ``I have been given enormous gifts,'' Prager said. Although he
``squandered those gifts inexcusably'' he was confident he could
``make so much more of a contribution by going forward with this
alternative sentencing proposal.''
   More than 20 other people connected with the smuggling operation
have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years. Groff said
he talked with several of them and none objected to Prager's
alternative sentence.

   Three Haitian soldiers armed with rifles and
seeking political asylum forced their way onto an American Airlines
jetliner in Haiti Saturday and flew to New York, officials said.
They were arrested when the plane landed at Kennedy Airport.
   No one was injured in the incident, said American Airlines
spokesman Jim Brown. The three men had surrendered their weapons
before the airplane left Port-au-Prince.
   Airport security and the FBI were waiting when the plane, with
224 passengers and a crew of nine, arrived about 8:15 p.m in New
York. The three men were arrested without incident, Brown said.
   ``They intended no harm to anyone, there was no threat of
violence,'' said James Fox, director of the FBI's New York office.
``They just said they wanted to leave Haiti for New York City.''
   The men were identified as Edouine Noel, 24; Nicolas Mormil, 23;
and Jean Charlston Beinamie, 23, said FBI spokesman Chris Favo. All
three were taken to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower
Manhattan pending a hearing Monday on their request for asylum, he
said.
   They men were regular army personnel who did not want to be part
of the recent coup in Haiti, said Port Authority Detective William
Ahrens.
   American Airlines Flight 658 took off at 4:40 p.m. after the
three soldiers slipped under a wire fence that surrounds
Port-au-Prince International Airport and ran aboard the plane,
airport employees said.
   Radio Haiti Inter said the plane's captain agreed to fly the
three men to New York, the plane's destination. The station said
the men made no political statements.
   Eric Boucicault, director of American Airlines in Haiti, said
``three soldiers on duty entered at the end of the line of
passengers with a determined air. We could not refuse their
entrance. As a result of negotiation, they deposited all their
arms, pistols and rifles, in the pilot's cabin.
   ``Now they are seated calmly in their seats, and normal service
is being maintained,'' he said before the airplane landed in New
York.
   Flight 658 runs daily between New York and the capital city of
Port-au-Prince, where it arrives about 2 p.m. and leaves after 4
p.m.
   ``The pilot did a super job,'' said passenger Cameron Smith of
Boston. ``He negotiated a deal with them. He put them up in first
class and tended to them the rest of the way.''
   Other passengers were not immediately let off the plane as
authorities questioned them. The approximately 200 people who were
waiting for the flight's arrival said they were not told about the
incident until the plane landed.
   ``They were pointing M-16's already cocked,'' said the Rev.
Eugene Bryant, a Brooklyn minister who performed missionary work in
Haiti. ``It was all in French. We were just watching.''
   Many people refused to give their names for fear of retaliation
by the new Haitian regime.
   ``I went there for two weeks. It was the scariest two weeks of
my life,'' said one woman passenger, declining to give her name.
``I thought I was going to get a break, but the plane ride was no
break.''
   Haiti has been beset by turmoil in recent weeks.
   A Sept. 17 coup by lower-ranking soldiers led to the ouster of
Lt. Gen. Henry Namphy. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril was installed as
president and the coup triggered a huge military uprising that led
to the ouster of military commanders loyal to Namphy and the
Duvalier family dictatorship that preceded him.

   Dogs adopted from the same animal
shelter have attacked two children, killing one and seriously
injuring the second in separate incidents a week apart.
   Bobby Ivy, 5, needed 25 stitches to close facial wounds suffered
when he was bitten Thursday by an old English sheepdog named
Tinkerbell, who was adopted a day earlier, said the boy's mother,
Hope Ivy of Fort Walton Beach.
   Nathan Carpenter, 4, was killed Sept. 23 by a large mixed-breed
at nearby Wynnhaven Beach. A neighbor had adopted the dog named
Chief about two hours earlier.
   Both dogs were from the Panhandle Animal Welfare Society, known
as PAWS.
   ``I'm going to have the (PAWS) board review our adoption
policy,'' said the shelter's executive director, Mike Zoller. ``At
this point, if someone tells us a dog has any history of any
aggression, we're not going to put it in the (adoption) program.''
   Zoller described Chief as a lovable dog, and said when Chief's
owners dropped him off Sept. 12, they didn't mention any aggressive
tendencies.
   In the first attack, Chief escaped from his new owner's yard and
was found by the victim's mother, Sharon Kay Carpenter. She noticed
the PAWS tag, put the animal in her yard where her son was playing
and phoned the shelter to find out who owned the dog. The attack
began while she was on the telephone.
   Tests found Chief was not rabid after a sheriff's deputy shot
the dog.
   Tinkerbell was back at PAWS Friday under a 10-day quarantine,
although she is up-to-date on rabies shots, Zoller said. She
probably will be destroyed after the quarantine, he said.
   A record number of bite cases have been reported to the shelter
since the fatal attack last week, Zoller said.
   ``We must have eight or nine dogs in quarantine now,'' he said.
``I think it must be because people are acting strange around the
dogs now and the dogs can sense it.''

   John Sweezy's had enough of 1988. When 1989
comes, he says, maybe strangers will stop calling.
   His office telephone number's last four digits are 1-9-8-8.
   ``I've had this number for years, and all of the sudden the year
is in and I get calls,'' said Sweezy, chairman of the Marion County
Republican Party.
   His phone number is close to the number of the campaign offices
of Democrats Evan Bayh and Frank O'Bannon, the Democratic
candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively.
   It also is similar to the phone numbers for the campaign
headquarters of Republican gubernatorial candidate John Mutz. And
the re-election campaign of Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., also has
a telephone number ending with 1988.
   The Republican chairman simply tells the callers they have the
wrong number.
   But Robert Meyne, president of Hoosier Celebration `88, a group
that celebrates the state's history and promotes its future, has
another reply. His phone number is similar to the political
campaigns'.
   ``I just tell them to send the money to Rob Meyne,'' he said.

   Students were sent outside. An office was
barricaded. And officials throughout the Eisenhower Elementary
School walked with a light step.
   The emergency?
   A sleeping skunk.
   When school counselor Noama Barnard arrived at her office
Thursday, she encountered the skunk, which was curled up for a
quiet nap.
   ``I heard some rustling in some papers and saw it move,'' Ms.
Barnard said. ``I decided I'd get out of there _ very slowly.''
   Next door to the counselor's office is the school lunchroom, and
officials led students outside.
   Folding chairs were used to barricade the counselor's office
until Enid animal control officers arrived and removed the animal.
   School Principal Mary Butler said the skunk may have entered
when the custodian left the door open during evening cleaning.
   The doors will be shut at night from now on, she added.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's leading producer of public-service
announcements released a national advertising campaign Friday
urging sexually active Americans to use condoms to prevent the
spread of AIDS.
   U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop endorsed the campaign at a
news conference, noting that it may be controversial but calling on
the media to carry it. The three major television networks said
they would.
   ``The public service campaign of The Advertising Council may
offend some people. I'm truly sorry about that,'' Koop said. ``You
cannot ignore people who might not have your own morality.'
   Critics of such advertising in the past have said it was
preferable to stress abstinence and monogamy, rather than the use
of condoms, to halt the sexual transmission of the AIDS virus.
   Koop, however, called abstinence ``not a viable option for most
people'' and said many people also are not monogamous.
   The Ad Council, a not-for-profit organization that has been
producing public service promotions since 1942, has produced
several highly successful public service campaigns, such as the
``Take a Bite Out of Crime'' promotion.
   At least two other national advertising campaigns have urged the
use of condoms against AIDS, one sponsored by the federal Centers
for Disease Control and another from the American Medical
Association. Some of those ads were broadcast on network television.
   The council, sponsored by the advertising and communications
industries, distributes its ads to media outlets for use at their
discretion.
   ``This is not the first time we will be airing PSAs that deal
with that subject directly,'' said Dom Giofre, NBC's spokesman.
``What is significant here is that The Ad Council, which is a
major, very thorough group, is getting into this thing.''
   Spokesmen for ABC and CBS said they, too, would broadcast the
announcements. ABC and NBC ran spots with a similar message last
year, but CBS did not. Cable News Network spokesmen said they had
not seen the spots yet.
   The project includes three spots in English and Spanish for
television, radio, print and outdoor transit display.
   In one TV ad, a youth standing in the rain says: ``My brother
wouldn't listen to me. I told him: `You have sex, you use condoms
so you don't get AIDS.' He laughed and said condoms weren't macho.''
   The youth then crumples to a sitting position, his back against
a tombstone. ``My brother,'' he says. ``He was so macho.''

   As ``Strawberry Fields Forever'' played on
speakers, hundreds of fans gathered Friday on Vine Street to
celebrate the late John Lennon as the former Beatle received a star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
   At a news conference before the dedication ceremony, Lennon's
widow Yoko Ono said her husband had dreamed about receiving a
sidewalk star.
   ``I remember John and I walking in Hollywood, and John was
pointing out and reading all the names and wondering why he wasn't
there,'' she said.
   Hundreds of fans, mostly middle-aged, crowded against barricades
in front of Capitol Records, the Beatles' original label, for the
ceremony, holding ``John Lennon Forever'' signs and bouquets of
roses.
   The star dedication coincides with the Oct. 7 release of the
David Wolper film documentary on the former Beatle's life titled
``Imagine: John Lennon.''
   Ono said she wasn't disturbed that the star was vandalized
earlier this week with paint and the scrawled words, ``I buried
John,'' because she was too excited about the movie, which focuses
on the couple's life.
   Lennon was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 8, 1980.

   One Palestinian was killed and
three wounded Friday in violence triggered by a confrontation
between a Jewish settler and Arabs who stoned his car, officials
and witnesses said.
   In addition, the army said an 18-year-old boy was killed in
Hebron when soldiers opened fire after they were stoned by a group
of masked Arab youths. Hospital officials said Zain Hafez Karaki
died of bullet wounds to the chest and arm.
   There were conflicting reports about what caused the death of
the other Arab.
   Palestinian witnesses said the man was shot by one of about 15
Jewish settlers who gathered in downtown Hebron at the site where
settler leader Rabbi Moshe Levinger's car was stoned.
   But police spokesman Mordechai Barakat said an investigation
showed Levinger only fired a single shot in the air.
   An army spokesman said an autopsy would be performed to
determine the cause of death. She said one report indicated the
Arab died when he fell from a roof while fleeing gunshots.
   The army declared Hebron a closed military area and blocked
reporters from entering the city.
   Mukassad Hospital officials identified the dead man as Kayed
Hassan Salah, 38, who owned a shop near site of the shooting. They
said he died of bullet wounds to the back and left shoulder.
   The three wounded were a 14-year-old boy shot in the pelvis and
left thigh, a 20-year-old man shot in the right thigh and a
23-year-old man shot in the left shoulder, officials at Hebron's
Alia Hospital said.
   Seven other Palestinians were wounded Friday in clashes around
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, reports said.
   Levinger opened fire after about 30 Palestinians stoned his car,
Arab witnesses said. They said about 15 Israeli settlers joined
Levinger in firing their weapons.
   The city, where about 60 Jewish settlers live alongside 70,000
Arabs, has been the site of frequent clashes between Jews and Arabs
since the Palestinian uprising began in December.
   Levinger's wife Miriam told The Associated Press her husband
fired in the air when his car was stoned but said he was not
responsible for the Arab fatality and three other casualties.
   Mrs. Levinger, who emigrated to Israel from Brooklyn, N.Y., said
three of her children and a grandchild were in the car with her
husband but that she did not witness the incident herself.
   Abdul Rahman Abu Shekhadem, a Palestinian college student who
suffered a broken arm in the confrontation, said one of the Jewish
settlers sprayed the area with gunfire.
   ``He started shooting. He didn't know where he was shooting or
who he was shooting,'' Abu Shekhedem, 21, said from his bed at
Jerusalem's Mukassad Hospital.
   The deaths raised to 280 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israel's 21-year occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip began Dec. 8. Six Israelis have also died in the
violence during the same period.
   Also Friday, Israel extended the closing of West Bank schools
and universities to Nov. 15 to try to prevent an expected rise in
violence by student activists, said Olivier Rafowicz, a spokesman
for the military administration.
   The 1,198 schools and universities attended by about 300,000
students were to have opened Sept. 1.
   The army also extended the closing of the Arab-run Palestine
Press Service for another year, the defense ministry said. The
service, closed in March for allegedly inciting violence, monitored
events in the occupied lands and was a key source for foreign
reporters.

   The pilot of a hijacked Brazilian
jetliner said Friday that he took his plane into a dive before
landing in an effort to dislodge the hijacker's gun.
   The hijacker, who killed a co-pilot and wounded three others
before he was shot and captured Thursday, wanted to crash the VASP
Airlines Boeing 737 a government building in the Brazilian capital,
officials said. He was hospitalized in stable condition Friday,
authorities said.
   Raimundo Conceicao, 28, wounded three other crew members. He
held 98 passengers and another three crew members hostage for eight
hours before police shot him as he walked toward a getaway plane
with the pilot.
   The pilot, Fernando Murillo Silva, told TV Globo on Friday that
before landing in the central city of Goiania ``with only five
minutes worth of fuel left, I took the plane into a dive, hoping
the hijacker would fall on his head and release the gun.''
   Conceicao stumbled but held on to the gun and pointed it at the
pilot's head.
   As the plane landed at Goiania's Santa Genoveva airport,
Conceicao shot and killed co-pilot Salvador Evangelista and wounded
a flight engineer and a steward.
   Using his fingers to simulate the weapon, Silva described how
the hijacker put the gun to the co-pilot's head and pulled the
trigger.
   ``It was horrible,'' he said.
   A federal police spokesman, Paulo Marro, said the gunman
probably will stand trial for homicide and for endangering the
lives of those aboard.
   Marra said police did not have details on Conceicao's
background. Air Force Minister Octavio Moreira Lima earlier called
the hijacker ``a psychopath.''
   ``The hijacker told negotiators he wanted to settle accounts
with the president over the country's economic policies,'' Moreira
Lima said.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma said the hijacker told the
control tower he wanted ``to slam the Boeing 737 into a ministry
building in Brasilia.''
   Inflation for this year is forecast at 800 percent under
President Jose Sarney.
   Alcir Pereira, spokesman for the Santa Genoveva Hospital in
Goiania, said Conceicao had been successfully operated on and was
recovering. ``He is out of danger,'' he said.
   TV Globo showed Conceicao handcuffed to his hospital bed.
   Conceicao hijacked the twin-engine jet minutes after it left the
southeastern city of Belo Horizonte for Rio de Janeiro. He barged
into the cockpit and demanded that the pilot fly to Brasilia.
   After circling Brasilia, the pilot was told that because of
security reasons he could not land there, and the plane headed for
Goiania, 125 miles away.
   Air Force spokesman Col. Eden Avolinsque said Sarney gave orders
not to negotiate with the hijacker nor refuel the plane.
   As hundreds of heavily-armed police and army troops sealed off
the Goiania airport, Conceicao agreed to get off the airliner,
release the passengers and fly to Brasilia on a small turboprop
plane _ taking only the pilot as a hostage.
   As the hijacker was walking toward the smaller plane, special
police agents fired and wounded him. Conceicao then spun around and
shot Silva, wounding him in the leg.

<HEAD>Lower-Than-Expected Press Turnout For Discovery Launch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer than half the journalists who
requested credentials for the Discovery launch actually showed up,
and NASA on Friday blamed new restrictions on access for the lower
turnout.
   ``There were many who told us they were not coming when they
learned of the creation of a new press site on the causeway,'' said
a statement from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The new site provided a view more than 6 miles from the shuttle,
whereas the Launch Complex 39 press site is just over 4 miles away.
   NASA said 2,318 news people picked up their accreditation
badges, compared to the 5,200 who requested credentials.
   The final number on hand for the launch _ the first U.S. manned
spaceflight since the 1986 Challenger disaster _ fell short of the
record 2,700 journalists who covered the Apollo 11 and Apollo 17
moon missions and the first space shuttle flight.
   Because of Air Force studies following Challenger that warned of
casualties that could be caused by falling debris from another
post-launch accident, Air Force officials responsible for range
safety at Kennedy Space Center recommended that only essential
personnel be allowed at the main press complex.
   Veteran space journalists were angered by the restrictions,
which they feared could lead to future tightening of coverage
allowed, especially for secret military missions.
   NASA and the Air Force finally compromised to allow 1,800 news
media representatives at the near site, giving larger allotments to
the news media with the tightest deadline pressures and need for
staff. The others had to watch from the causeway, without telephone
lines or computers at hand.
   However, Jay Barbree, who has covered the space program for
three decades for NBC News radio, said he thought the Discovery was
one of the most extensively reported launches. He said the amount
of time its coverage was carried on the national networks was the
most he could recall.
   ``A lot of the people who get accredited are really coming here
to watch. So the tourists didn't come because of the restrictions,
but the working press covered it comprehensively,'' Barbree said.
   Reporters at the secondary site said their view was excellent,
but that their separation from communications equipment was a
handicap.

   An experiment similar to shaking up
oil and vinegar turned out to be more like mixing an ``egg white in
an egg yolk'' when astronaut David C. Hilmers and fellow Discovery
crew members performed the test Friday.
   Hilmers and George D. ``Pinky'' Nelson spent part of the morning
working on the experiment known as phase partitioning, and some of
their activities were broadcast on NASA's satellite television
channel.
   ``It's a little experiment that tries to look at the fluid
dynamics of separating two different phases of materials,'' Hilmers
said.
   Researchers hope the experiment will help them better understand
the role gravity and other physical forces play in separating
unmixable liquids. During the experiment, two polymers are
dissolved in a saline solution and they then separate.
   on Earth, the heavier material floats on top of the other, but
the outcome is much different in space where there is no gravity.
   ``Pinky and I have been shaking up this phase partitioning
experiment. It's a lot like shaking up vinegar and oil _ in 0 g
(gravity) it has a somewhat different mixing. It's more like an egg
white in an egg yolk,'' Hilmers added, and laughter followed from
another astronaut.
   In all, there are 11 experiments the astronauts will conduct
during their four-day mission, including two student projects.
   The first post-Challenger flight's main purpose _ to deploy a
communications satellite _ was completed early Friday when a
two-stage booster rocket pushed the satellite into its final orbit.
   NASA grounded shuttles missions after the Challenger exploded
Jan. 28, 1986, and the disaster also halted researchers' efforts to
test their theories in space for more than 2{ years.
   Hilmers said the phase partitioning experiment was a good
example of the need for manned spaceflights.
   ``I guess one of the things this (experiment) can show is the
use of people in space. We can look at the experiment, see if there
are any unique changes and observe them. We can take pictures as we
see unique changes, and possibly modify the experiment,'' he said.
   An experiment completed earlier Friday was the aggregation of
red blood cells, which consists of blood samples donated by people
with various illnesses such as cancer and diabetes.
   During the experiment, a pump flushes each blood sample through
a system in an effort to study how red blood cells collect in 0
gravity. Two 35mm cameras photograph the experiment, and Nelson
said the device seemed to be working.
   ``We could hear it whirling and taking pictures all night
long,'' he said.

   Hog farmers continue to expand production,
with inventories in the major pork states this fall the largest in
five years, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   As of Sept. 1, the inventory of hogs and pigs in the 10 major
pork states totaled an estimated 45.1 million head, up 5 percent a
year ago and 14 percent more than two years ago, the report said.
That was the biggest 10-state inventory on Sept. 1 since 1983.
   The report also included for the first time a total U.S.
inventory figure for Sept. 1 _ 58.3 million head.
   In the 10 biggest states, which account for about 77 percent of
the U.S. total inventory, the number of breeding hogs was up 3
percent and 12 percent from Sept. 1, 1987 and 1986, respectively,
to 5.47 million head. That indicated further production increases
in the coming months.
   Officials said the 10-state Sept. 1 inventory of market hogs _
animals headed for slaughter and the consumer market _ totaled 39.6
million head, up 5 percent and 14 percent from the previous two
years, respectively.
   The 10-state pig crop during the summer months of June, July and
August was 17.9 million head, up 2 percent from the same period a
year ago and 11 percent more than in the summer of two years ago.
   Looking a future prospects, the report said hog farmers surveyed
in the 10 states intend to have 2.35 million sows give birth in
September, October and November, up 4 percent from farrowings a
year ago and 11 percent more than in 1986.
   The following list shows the Sept. 1 inventory. The first
number, in thousands, is the total number of hogs in the state, the
second is the Sept. 1 figure's percentage of a year earlier.

   The deaths of three children and two teen-agers in
a house fire have been ruled homicides and investigators continuing
seeking leads Friday to the identity of the arsonist who started
the blaze.
   One of the victims of Wednesday's blaze had earlier spoken about
receiving threatening telephone calls, his girlfriend said.
   Keyana Thompson, 14, a friend of victim Bernard Jordan, said he
told her that the caller once said: ``I'm going to burn your house
up and you're going to be in it.''
   Jordan, 16, became so fearful of the caller that he planned to
leave town and left a note for Thompson in case anything happened
to him. Jordan's friends and relatives said they did not know who
was threatening him.
   ``We're checking out all those leads. We're trying to verify
that,'' Dallas Deputy Fire Chief T.W. Oney said.
   Oney declined to say what evidence was gathered to lead to the
arson ruling. ``We're talking to anyone that's got something to
say. We've picked up a lot of information,'' he said.
   He declined to say if there was a specific suspect.
   The Dallas County Medical Examiner's office ruled the deaths
homicides Thursday.
   Oney said firefighters were hampered in their attempts to battle
the blaze by anti-burglary bars on the windows and a love seat
pushed against the door.
   ``We had to break in the house. This was very tragic. It's worse
because it is an arson situation and it was children,'' said Oney.
   Investigators said they weren't sure if the love seat was
purposely pushed against the door, or if it was knocked there when
the victims tried to escape. Investigators also found a charred
1-gallon gasoline can in the house; it was purchased by the family
recently for use with a lawn mower but was supposed to be on the
porch, officials said.
   The father of one of the victims was arrested when he tried to
run to her side in an ambulance.
   Police Chief Mack Vines ordered an internal investigation to
determine if departmental procedure was violated when officers
wrestled Homer Hutchins to the ground and placed him in a neck
restraining hold after he illegally parked his truck and tried to
run to his 2-year-old daughter, Jasmas, whose 18-year-old mother
also died in the fire.

   Twenty-seven pilots accused of lying about
drug and drinking convictions on license applications were indicted
Friday in a government crackdown on unreported abuses among the
nation's pilots.
   Among those charged are 12 current or former commercial pilots,
including a pilot for Delta Air Lines. That pilot and a former Pan
American World Airways pilot were the only ones identified as
employees of major passenger airlines.
   The indictments issued Friday also named two student pilots, 10
private pilots and three others. All but three are from Florida.
   ``These indictments are the first in a special nationwide
project ... to vigorously pursue this abuse in a critical sector of
the nation's transportation system,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert
Genzman.
   Genzman said authorities knew of no mishaps involving those
charged.
   In Washington, Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley said
hundreds of indictments were expected as a result of the nationwide
investigation. He said the charges were ``indicative of the serious
problem of drug and alcohol abuse which has permeated all walks of
life and all professions in our society.''
   The Transportation Department has proposed a broad range of drug
tests, including random tests, of commercial airline pilots and
other flight crew personnel.
   A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said the
past convictions would not have necessarily precluded the pilots
from obtaining a medical certificate and pilot's license.
   But, said spokesman Fred Farrar, the fact that the applicants
had past convictions for drug- or alcohol-related offenses would
have caused an FAA medical examiner to ``look long and hard at the
circumstances.''
   Friday's indictments were the result of a two-year investigation
that began with an audit of the national driver's registry to
uncover alcohol or drug-related traffic violations, said Ben Lorigo
of the Department of Transportation inspector general's office in
Washington.
   Painstaking computer checks of 711,000 pilots around the country
revealed 10,200 had had driving privileges revoked in the previous
seven years and 750 of them had failed to report it on the required
FAA medical forms, he said at a news conference in Tampa.
   The 27 indicted Friday, if convicted on all charges, could each
face at least five years in prison and fines ranging from $5,000 to
$250,000 for making false statements to the FAA on medical
certificates.
   The concealed convictions included drunken driving, trafficking
in cocaine and possession of marijuana.
   Genzman said there was an amnesty program within the last
several years to allow those who had withheld information on their
forms to come forward. Some did, but the number was very low,
Genzman said, indicating to federal authorities the problem was
widespread.
   Of the former and current commercial pilots charged, Lorigo said
some may be retired or fly as a sideline, and not as a career pilot.
   The Delta pilot, Fred Kopec, 27, of Orlando, was charged with
failing to reveal a drunken driving arrest in Lee County, Ala., in
January 1984.
   Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate in Atlanta confirmed Kopec worked
for the airline, but said Delta had not yet been formally notified
of his indictment.
   When Delta is informed, ``we will take the appropriate action,
which would be to suspend the pilot,'' Ms. Pate said.
   Another Delta spokesman, Jim Lundy, said Kopec has worked for
Delta for two years and is a second officer for L-1011 jetliners.
   Kopec could not be reached for comment Friday. A telephone
number in Orlando for Kopec could not be located.

   The safety of Department of Energy nuclear
reactors came under heavy criticism at a congressional hearing
Friday, with one department official comparing the situation to the
ill-fated space shuttle Challenger.
   ``There are currently some senior managers within the department
with an attitude toward production reactor safety which on the face
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program
prior to the Challenger accident,'' said an internal memo released
at the hearing.
   The Sept. 16 memo was written by Richard Starostecki, a deputy
assistant secretary, to his boss, Ernest Baynard III, the assistant
energy secretary for environment, safety and health.
   Starostecki said the safety office staff is often challenged to
prove that the department's reactors, which produce nuclear
materials for the Department of Defense, are unsafe before
officials will act on the office's concerns.
   His memo did not identify the senior managers, but it did say
that Secretary John Herrington and Deputy Secretary Joseph Salgado
had taken ``steps to overcome this attitude and lack of technical
inquisitiveness.''
   This and other memos critical of the operations of department
facilities were distributed at a joint hearing by the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Government Operations
subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources.
   The focus of the hearing was an incident in August when there
was an unexpected power surge during the restarting of one of the
reactors at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina.
   Witnesses said employees of the plant's operator, the du Pont
Co., ignored the surge _ caused by some partially activated tritium
left in the reactor vessel _ and continued to power the reactor,
which eventually shut itself down.
   The department's safety office and outside consultants later
concluded that no procedures for such a situation had been
established during the 30 years the plant has been operating.
   Dexter Peach of the congressional General Accounting Office said
there was no danger of the reactor going out of control, ``but
nobody knew it at the time.''
   ``This could have been another Chernobyl if they had guessed
wrong,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. ``If I didn't know what was
going on in a nuclear reactor, I would shut it down.''
   Asked to characterize the overall safety ethic at the Savannah
River Plant, Robert Keller, a senior nuclear engineer with the
safety office, replied: ``I would use the term seat-of-the-pants,
or cavalier.''
   Added Robert Smith, the safety office's representative at the
plant: ``They do not have the technical understanding of basic
principles to allow them to make a good decision, to put the
reactor in a safe condition if it was in an unsafe condition. These
operators do not have the knowledge.''
   The officials said that although Westinghouse Corp. is taking
over for du Pont next year, many of the control room people will be
remaining on the job.
   Starostecki, who said he lacked confidence in the control room
personnel, testified that had the power surge occurred at a
commercial nuclear power plant, federal rules would have required
an immediate shutdown.
   He said that in the last 17 years, problems at Savannah River
reactors have forced about 9 to 12 shutdowns a year. ``A commercial
reactor would have difficulty with three or four a year,'' he said.
   He said inspections have turned up ``several hundred
deficiencies'' at the plant's P reactor and that ``portions of the
plant have been operating in a very poor condition for years.''

   Gov. Buddy Roemer said Friday he cannot
accept a Pardon Board's recommendation of a six-month sentence for
a convicted killer who escaped from prison 18 years ago and built a
new life in Tennessee.
   Henry Staggs, who fled from a state prison at DeQuincy in
southwestern Louisiana in 1970, wound up in Columbia, Tenn., where
he operated an auto repair ship as Douglas Gillette.
   His freedom ended Feb. 5 when FBI agents arrested him.
   When he escaped, Staggs had been serving a 15-year sentence for
manslaughter in the 1969 shooting death of a nightclub bouncer in
Port Allen, across the Mississippi River from Baton Rouge.
   The Pardon Board recommended the six-month sentence and five
years of supervised parole for Staggs, 41, who is free on bond in
Tennessee.
   Roemer, who can either accept or reject the board's
recommendation, said Friday that he had returned the case to the
board.
   ``I was not comfortable with their recommendation, just speaking
very bluntly. A human life was taken, an escape from prison was
involved,'' he said. ``That was offset in part from apparent good
behavior over time. I say apparent. Who knows? But I was not happy
with the decision and have returned it to the board for another
look.''
   The governor did not indicate what recommendation he would
accept, saying he would work with the Pardon Board.
   During a Pardon Board hearing, Staggs said he remembered almost
nothing of the killing of George Ballas. He blamed the shooting on
alcoholism that developed while he served in the Army in the 1960s.
   Staggs said he decided to escape after learning of his father's
declining health in his home state of Tennessee.
   His wife, Bridget, said she knew nothing of his past until his
arrest. She said he was dedicated to her and their three children.
   The Pardon Board received letters and petitions from about 2,000
Tennessee residents asking that Staggs be allowed to remain free.

<HEAD>Senate Sends Reagan $46.6 Billion Farm Money Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved Friday and sent President
Reagan a $46.6 billion agriculture money bill that limits a
three-year-old export subsidy that has spurred overseas sales of
U.S. grain.
   The bill, approved 90-4 by the Senate in the final congressional
vote, contains $46.6 billion in budget authority for a wide array
of programs ranging from farm payments to food stamps.
   The budget authority level was down from $56.2 billion last year
while outlays under the bill would total only $26.9 billion.
   Farm appropriations often reflect a wide gap between budget
authority and actual outlays. For one thing, the $8.8 billion
earmarked for the government's Commodity Credit Corp. is really a
reimbursement for a revolving fund and not counted as an outlay.
The Commodity Credit Corp. operates the Agriculture Department's
major crop subsidy programs.
   Other big-ticket items included in the measure: $13.6 billion
for food stamps; $1.929 billion for the nutrition program for
women, infants and children; $1.48 billion for humanitarian food
exports, and $1.864 billion for the Conservation Reserve Program.
   The Conservation Reserve Program pays farmers to take highly
erodible acreage out of crop production for a decade.
   The measure provides for $770 billion under the Export
Enhancement Program. The program makes in-kind payments of surplus
crops to exporters to send American wheat, feed grains and other
commodities overseas.
   A substantial increase in sales is attributed to the program,
which was established under wide-ranging 1985 farm legislation. In
return, the government has paid more than $2 billion worth of
commodities to the world's largest grain companies and other
exporters.
   The House, in quest of budget savings, had sought to cap the
program at $900 million for the fiscal year getting under way
Saturday. But House-Senate conferees ended up adopting the Senate
level.
   The bill also held to $200 million spending under the 1985
Targeted Export Assistance Program. It pays for advertising and
other promotion of American agricultural products in overseas
markets.
   It had been authorized at $325 million in the upcoming fiscal
year, but Appropriations Committee lawmakers slashed out $125
million after the program came under criticism within the House for
using taxpayer funds to advertise specific brands of agricultural
products.
   The measure also attempts to close a loophole under which the
nation's commercial honey producers have been circumventing a limit
of $250,000 a year for any individual on gains through forfeiture
of price-support loans.
   Under normal farm programs, farmers use their crops for
collateral to obtain the loans and then deliberately forfeit if
that would yield them greater earnings than selling on the open
market. The Commodity Credit Corp., in effect, becomes the buyer
and supports a price set by the government rather than by the
market.
   Lawmakers thought they had capped the benefits at $250,000
several years ago, but the nation's commercial beekeepers were able
to find a perfectly legal route around the restriction.
   The Senate also sent the money bill to the president amid
complaints about the job status of George Dunlop, the assistant
secretary of agriculture for natural resources and environment.
   Dunlop got into a political rumpus with powerful House
Appropriations Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., and the panel
erased Dunlop's job from the bill. The Senate refused to go along
and the fate of the former aide to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., became
a painful point between the two chambers.
   Meanwhile, Capitol Hill wags produced lapel buttons that said:
``Save George Dunlop.''
   ``The House was, in effect, trying to do away with his job and,
in effect, to do away with him,'' Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said.
He said, however, that House and Senate conferees had agreed on two
other job titles that Dunlop could get with the approval of
Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle took time out from staff briefings Friday to raise money and
tour a fire equipment exhibition before a weekend of mock debates
leading up to his confrontation next week with Democratic
countrpart Lloyd Bentsen.
   The Indiana senator boarded his campaign plane clutching some
briefing notebooks after a day in which he underwent questions and
answers from his aides in what a spokesman said was a preliminary
run-through of the format for debate Wednesday in Omaha, Neb.
   ``We're ready,'' Quayle told reporters at the exhibition of fire
engines, fire boats and hooks and ladders.
   In a reference to the media scrutiny he has faced since becoming
George Bush's running mate, Quayle told the audience of several
hundred firefighters: ``I want you all to know I'm very accustomed
to putting out fires. I've learned that in my trade.''
   ``We look forward to the competition of ideas in the debate
ahead of us because we're going to debate the future,'' he said.
   Spokesman David Prosperi said that on Saturday, Quayle would
conduct a formal mock debate with Sen. Bob Packwod, R-Ore., who is
standing in for Bentsen in the debate preparations. The sessions
will be videotaped and Quayle will review them over the weekened.
   He is getting advice from Roger Ailes, George Bush's media guru,
who sat in on Friday's sessions. The sessions are being held at an
undisclosed office building in the Washington area.
   Aides say the strategy for the debate will be to concentrate on
Michael Dukakis, not on his running mate.
   ``I think Bentsen has to try and explain the positions of his
running mate and convince the viewing audience and others that
Dukakis is in the mainstream,'' Prosperi said. ``Bentsen is not the
issue. The issue is the qualifications of his running mate.''
   The circle of aides that participated in Friday's briefings
included Stuart Spencer, Quayle's campaign manager; Ken Khachigian,
his speechwriter; Jim Cicconi, his research director; Mitch
Daniels, former White House political director; Prosperi and Ailes.
Packwood also sat in on the session, Prosperi said.
   ``We are just trying to familiarize him with the format, the way
the debate is set up, and discuss how to deal with probable and
possible attacks by Sen. Bentsen ,'' @e cav.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's sudden overhaul
of the Kremlin power structure reinvigorates his reform drive and
signals his determination to best the bureaucracy he blames for
slowing him down.
   The Soviet leader's swiftly executed power play Friday and
Saturday elevated him to the presidency, put him in charge of the
government as well as the ruling Communist Party and left the
Kremlin with no clear No. 2.
   In action-packed top-level meetings, Gorbachev practically
established a mandatory retirement age by pushing all but one
septuagenarian off the party's ruling Politburo and sent an
unmistakable message through the vast Soviet bureaucracy that he
expects a similar pruning of dead wood at all levels.

   President Reagan signed on Saturday the last
of 13 spending bills for fiscal year 1989, praising Congress for
passing them on schedule and avoiding the ``perils of Pauline
budget games'' of previous years.
   ``For the first time in years, all the government's budgetary
work is done,'' Reagan said in his weekly radio address.
   ``The last of the government's 13 appropriations bill have been
delivered to me and I have signed them,'' he said hours after
Congress approved the money to keep federal agencies operating.
   Lawmakers finished work on the bills minutes ahead of Saturday's
start of the new fiscal year. It was the first time since 1976 that
the House and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, had passed the
bills separately and on time.

   George Bush holds an Electoral College edge

   ``It's not over yet by any stretch of the imagination,'' said
Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas. ``But he's got to go on

   Republicans say the vice president has hit his stride and the
issues are working in his favor. ``Dukakis won the primary on his
Massachusetts miracle claim, but now people are remembering what
government, the economy, was under Jimmy Carter,'' said Tony
Feather, executive director of the Republican Party in Missouri,

   Two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper
and iron-ore mining scene of far northern Michigan.
   It started as a glint in a Dow Chemical Co. metallurgist's eye.
First Dow, and now a Colorado company, Crystal Exploration Inc.,
entered the search for diamonds in the state's Upper Peninsula.
   Seven Kimberlite pipes _ volcanic rock shafts that can yield the
earth's hardest mineral _ have been discovered.
   Core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sand-grain sized
diamonds, too few and too small for commercial production. But the
explorers say the search is young.
   The pipe formations are in a 40-mile area around Iron Mountain
and Crystal Falls, at the western end of the Upper Peninsula along
the Wisconsin border.
   In the few places on earth they are found, Kimberlite pipes
occur in clusters of up to several dozen, said James Huml, a Dow
research associate.
   Huml, a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation, said
he thinks there are more than a dozen Kimberlite pipes in the Upper
Peninsula.
   Dow has searched for six years. Now more exploration and mining
expertise is needed, Huml said. ``Dow is not a hard-rock mining
company.''
   Dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data, for an
undisclosed amount, to Crystal Exploration Inc., a Colorado
subsidiary of Sydney, Australia's Restech International Ltd.
Restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in
western Australia.
   It will carry on the search, while Dow holds onto an option to
take part in the exploration and development, and to share in any
profits.
   Occasional diamond finds in Ohio farm fields in the late 1800s
and early 1900s long had geologists looking to te north, said
Crystal Exploration's president, Sigfried Muessig.
   Muessig said a Kimberlite pipe, named for Kimberly in the
diamond-mining region of South Africa, is the only formation known
to produce the gems.
   ``It is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up
120 miles from the bowels of the earth, and the heat and pressure
have formed the diamonds,'' he said.
   ``It's a very rare occurrence,'' Huml said. Other Kimberlite
pipes have been found in Arkansas, Kansas, Wyoming and Colorado.
None commercially produce diamonds.
   There were no volcanic remnants in Ohio, so geologists thought
glaciers carried the diamonds there from Canada, Muessig said.
   But he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the U.S. Geological
Survey found a Kimberlite formation _ the Lake Ellen Pipe _ about
10 miles northeast of Crystal Falls.
   It was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200
million years ago in the Upper Peninsula, and possibly generated
the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind.
   The glaciers flattened the volcanoes, but since 1981 Dow has
found six more Kimberlite pipes _ several hundred feet across at
the surface and covered by volcanic debris, Huml said.
   In Dow's explorations, he said, ``We have found microdiamonds,
generally small, less than a millimeter in diameter. They are
grain-sized.''
   But the explorers still think the western Upper Peninsula was
the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south. ``We
think there is good potential, because of the historical finds,''
Muessig said.
   Crystal Exploration will do more sampling in the already
discovered pipes in the next year, Muessig said, and will continue
exploring for more Kimberlite formations, ``in hopes the next pipe
we discover will have gem-quality stones.''

<HEAD>Toni Childs: Singing Words From Within</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer-songwriter Toni Childs leafs through
a stack of press clippings comparing her favorably to Joan
Armatrading, Phoebe Snow, Janis Ian, Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega,
Miriam Makeba and Laura Nyro.
   She's been seeing a lot of stories like that since her first
album, ``Union,'' was released by A&M Records in the spring.
   ``I can give you more,'' she says with a sublime smile and a
hint of frustration. ``Grace Slick, Bette Midler, Annie Lennox,
Janis Joplin _ every female that anybody's ever liked, I think.''
   The smile reflects her unswaying confidence that new singers
will one day be compared with Toni Childs. The frustration suggests
the comparisons are flattering but imprecise.
   Using images that flow _ sometimes subconsciously _ from her own
extraordinary experiences, and a songwriting style that relies more
on intuition than technique, Childs has set herself apart from the
current crowd of women singers.
   For one thing, she says she often writes and performs in a
trance.
   Half a lifetime ago, the 30-year-old singer left an unhappy home
for a journey that took her through a Northern California commune,
federal prison, Europe and the arms of musician David Ricketts. She
moved in with Ricketts in 1985, on the day she signed her contract
with A&M and shortly before Ricketts and David Baerwald hit it big
with David & David's highly successful ``Boomtown'' album.
   The love affair failed but the painful break-up inspired several
of the songs of self-discovery on ``Union,'' and she and Ricketts
remain close friends. They worked together on Childs' first album,
and she said he will play a big role in her second.
   Childs is planning to travel with Ricketts to Africa, Bali and
India in search of ``tones'' that will shape her second LP. They
have already begun work on some new songs, but she said the themes
and most melodies will be a product of her upcoming trek.
   ``All I know is that there are certain places I want to go
because of the tones, that I'm being drawn there because of the
tones. The tones always dictate to me what's really going on. So
I'm going to be true to that for whereever it's going to take me,''
she said in an interview.
   ``Maybe that's a really cosmic way of doing it. But the tones
hit parts of me that make me release things, or make me see things,
or maybe make me ask the questions that I wouldn't ordinarily ask.
And then I get answers that I find out for me.''
   She not only instinctively selects her destinations, but relies
on instinct when writing her songs, a process which has as much to
do with solving private mysteries as with making music.
   ``Your subconcious speaks to you really strongly, and when
you're doing something like music ... it's like dream time ... and
it's good to kind of pay attention to it,'' she said.
   Although her songs often sound like poems set to music, only one
song from the first album _ ``Zimbabwe'' _ actually started out
that way. The others extended from improvising with Ricketts on a
combination of ``groove and melody and mood.''
   ``You just kind of get in this trance with it and then these
words start coming out and, for me, the challenge is to find out
what ... I'm telling myself,'' she said. ``It unlocks some sort of
side of you that sometimes you might not have the courage to take a
look at.''
   That sort of spontaneity doesn't always translate well to a
stage performance, but Childs drew ovations at San Francisco's
famed Fillmore auditorium as she rocked through powerful versions
of songs that sounded more gentle on the album. No wonder the
comparisons to Joplin, Slick and Lennox.
   ``My sort of thing is to get in my trance,'' she said of her
live shows. ``(To) go back to the same place that the song
actually, originally came from _ that's my goal.''
   Although her introspective lyrics often ``haunt'' her, Childs
said her music has been most important to her as a way of looking
at her life.
   ``You know, on a pressure cooker it has that little place where
the steam escapes,'' she said. ``Well that's been my out, (a way)
to take a look at my life and the mistakes I've made, the choices
I've made or what choices I want to make.
   ``That's really what the music's about.''

   Host David McCullough promises there will be no
quiz after the new American history series, ``American Experience.''
   ``There are no lessons. It's never pedantic. It's never preachy.
No dates to memorize. None of the sort of horror sense that many
people have about history,'' he said.
   ``It's my experience that if you simply tell what happened, it
is so fascinating, it is so human, that you don't have to sugarcoat
the pill, you don't have to devise means to bring people into the
subject. They'll come in, because there's nothing more interesting
than what happened to people, and that's all history is.''
   The first installment in the anthology series, premiering on the
Public Broadcasting Service on Tuesday, is ``The Great San
Francisco Earthquake.'' A fascinating film produced by Tom
Weidlinger and narrated by F. Murray Abraham, it incorporates rare
footage taken just after the 1906 disaster as well as present-day
interviews with people who were there and compelling still
photographs.
   The film captures the vastness of the biggest natural disaster
to ever befall a North American city, but also the essence of good
ol' American pluck.
   In one of the stills, a chalked message is scrawled on a lone
standing wall amid the rubble: ``Bill McClure will find family at
West Berkeley.'' Another hastily constructed sign in front of a
toppled building says, ``A little disfigured but still in the ring.
MEN WANTED.''
   ``These films, which is why I'm so excited about the series,
these films are often extremely moving,'' said McCullough. ``You
can look up any past event in the encyclopedia or the almanac or a
history textbook, but there's no feeling. These films have feeling,
and you vicariously become part of the experience.''
   The series, underwritten by Aetna, has been funded for two
years, though the producers are hoping it will catch on and last a
long time, as soon as viewers realize it's a hodge-podge of tales
about individual events and people, not chapters from a textbook.
   ``We want to say certain things to the viewer very much the
first year,'' said executive producer Judy Crichton. ``We want to
say, we are eclectic, we are going to tell you stories about the
past, like Geronimo, and we're going to tell you stories about the
near present. We're going to tell you stories that resonate in
terms of contemporary life, and we're going to do it in a number of
different forms.''
   The second film, on Oct. 11, is ``Radio Bikini,'' an Academy
Award-nominated documentary about the atom bomb tests on Bikini
Atoll in the South Pacific.
   The story of Angie Debo, a historian who revealed injustices
against Oklahoma Indians, will be told in the Oct. 18 installment,
``Indians, Outlaws and Angie Debo.''
   On Oct. 25 there's a nice essay by CBS commentator Eric
Sevareid, who describes his physical and intellectual journey from
the isolated heartland of America to involvement in a war against
fascism in Europe, an individual metamorphosis that also mirrored a
societal change of heart.
   McCullough, author of such best-selling and award-winning
histories as ``The Path Between the Seas,'' about the Panama Canal,
and ``Mornings on Horseback,'' a biography of young Theodore
Roosevelt, finds the link between film and history a natural one.
   ``I got involved in writing history because of photography,'' he
said. ``Because of visual images. I saw some photographs one time
which got me interested in the subject, which led to my writing a
book on the subject. So I know when these imaginative and talented
people start nosing around in archives of old films and old still
photography, they're going to tell us things, reveal aspects of our
nature as a people that we haven't even thought about before.
   ``The reason most people aren't interested in history,'' he
said, ``is they've either had teachers or read books by people who
aren't interested in people. And there's nothing more interesting
in the world than our fellow human beings, and the fact that these
human beings lived in a different time from us doesn't mean that we
should be cut off from them.''

   HUGH'S PLACE _ ``Frank's Place'' executive producer Hugh Wilson
has signed a deal to develop new programming for Columbia Pictures
Television. Wilson, who produces ``Frank's Place'' at Viacom, won
an Emmy for writing the low-rated but critically acclaimed CBS
comedy. It is due back on the air sometime this season, but Wilson
hasn't been too optimistic about the fate of his character piece in
the high-pressure world of network ratings. Wilson also produced
the CBS sitcom ``WKRP in Cincinnati'' and directed the hit comedy
movie ``Police Academy.'' ...

   ``All our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance, All our
ignorance brings us nearer to death, But nearness to death no
nearer to God,'' T.S. Eliot, ``The Rock.''

   His poetry reflected the anguish of life, and his
pessimism was viewed archly by some. Still, T.S. Eliot was embraced
by the world as one of the major 20th century poets in the English
language.
   This year, his centenary year, has witnessed an outpouring of
celebrations for the late Nobelist, who himself considered William
Butler Yeats the greatest poet of our time.
   Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St. Louis on Sept. 26, 1888. He
lived in London from 1914 and became a British citizen in 1927. He
won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1948 and died in London on
Jan. 4, 1965. His poetic gift was extraordinary, from the
despairing early works _ ``The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,''
``The Waste Land'' _ to his later, more hopeful visions, such as
``Ash Wednesday'' and ``Four Quartets.''
   He also was a critic and dramatist, and his plays include
``Murder in the Cathedral,'' ``The Family Reunion'' and ``The
Cocktail Party.''
   On the 100th anniversary of his birth, Westminster Abbey held a
service at which admirers read from his works and his widow,
Valerie, laid a wreath at his memorial tablet.

   ``When the evening is spread out against the sky

   There have been other readings from Eliot's works throughout
England, two sessions filling London's Queen Elizabeth Hall and
Palace Theater with Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and veteran poet
Stephen Spender taking part.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. is airing five radio programs on
Eliot's long poem, ``Four Quartets,'' and performing four of his
plays.
   Eliot's work is the centerpiece of Europe's largest annual
literature festival, Oct. 1-16 at Cheltenham in western England.
Irish poet Seamus Heaney, considered one of the outstanding living
English-language poets, is giving the major festival lecture called
``On Learning From Eliot.''
   ``Quotations from Eliot like `the skull beneath the skin,' and
`in my end is my beginning' are found everywhere in literature and
the arts. You don't realize how much other poets and playwrights
have used him,'' said festival director Tim Sargeant.
   ``Eliot in his centenary year was the obvious choice for the
festival and he appeals to such a wide range of people.
   ``He wrote poems for children as well as the deep and involved
poetry of `The Waste Land.' His `Old Possum's Book of Practical
Cats' is the basis of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, `Cats'; Eliot
was affected by music, and composers in their turn have been
affected by him,'' Sargeant said.

   ``April is the cruelest month, breeding
   ``Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   However, centenary celebrations were marred by a protest over
three distinguished Jews, including Oxford philosopher Sir Isaiah
Berlin, lending their names to a trust fund appeal in Eliot's name
by the London Library, of which he was president.
   Critics recalled the anti-Semitic expressions in some of Eliot's
poetry and letters.
   In the 1927 poem ``Burbank With a Baedeker: Bleistein With a
Cigar,'' Eliot wrote: ``The rats are underneath the piles. The jew
is underneath the lot.''
   The poet also said in a lecture in January 1933, as Adolf Hitler
was about to take power in Germany: ``Reasons of race or religion
combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable
... and a spirit of excessive tolerance is to be deprecated.''
   
   Some critics say Eliot in time put aside anti-Semitism and that
it had no role in his later life.
   ``Eliot is much in favor these days because his ideas are now
fashionable,'' said poet Harry Gilonis. ``He was a classicist, a
monarchist, an Anglo-Catholic and very conservative, while in his
poetry he was a modernist, attacked in his day for pessimism and
formlessness.
   ``Eliot wasn't appreciated by the public then but he is admired
now, and with paperbacks for a mass market, more and more people
are reading his work.''

   ``Love is most nearly itself
   ``When here and now cease to matter
   ``Old men ought to be explorers
   ``Here and there does not matter.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The BBC stressed that while Eliot's pessimism has been much
criticized, when he was at the height of his powers Europe was in
political torment, and doubt was cast on the very survival of the
continent's civilization.
   Newspapers have run a steady stream of articles about Eliot's
poetry and what The Times of London called his ``messy, bewildering
and unpredictable'' life: Eliot's first wife, Vivien Haigh-Wood,
constantly complained of being ill and was eventually committed to
a mental institution.
   But The Times said in an editorial that Eliot was ``still an
inspiration'' for justifying and reinforcing European culture,
which was for him ``a congregation of ideas and values.''
   The centenary eve saw a memorial service in St. Michael's
church, East Coker, the Somerset village home of Eliot's ancestors
who went to America and where his ashes are interred. He
immortalized East Coker in ``Four Quartets.'' Eliot joined the
Faber publishing house as an editor when it was started in 1925.
Its first catalog included his poems from 1909-25.
   ``His books have sold in millions around the world and the
numbers are incalculable,'' said Joan Mackle, a publicist at Faber,
which sells all Eliot's works, which annually earn $2.5 million,
according to Forbes magazine.

   Actress Helen Mirren, like thousands of
Britons before her, traveled to the seaside spa of Bournemouth to
inspect the little cottage where the murder took place 53 years ago.
   Mirren's visit to the house beside the English Channel was
different from those of the merely curious. She was researching her
role as accused murderess Alma Rattenbury in ``Cause Celebre,''
which can be seen on PBS' ``Mystery!'' in two parts, Thursday and
Oct. 20.
   Rattenbury, 38, was accused, along with her teen-age lover,
George Bowman, of bludgeoning her elderly husband to death in 1935.
Their trial in London's Old Bailey caused a sensation, and
Rattenbury was widely reviled in England.
   ``I went to the house and I could feel the terrible trauma the
people felt,'' said Mirren. ``The house hasn't changed its
character since the tragedy took place. Bournemouth is a very
middle class, bourgeois, narrow-minded, smug town.''
   Ever since, the little house in Bournemouth has drawn the
curious who still seek out the house and visit the cemetery in
search of the unmarked graves.
   Francis Rattenbury is buried apart from his wife. She was
acquitted of the charge of murder, but within days stabbed herself
four times in the heart. Bowman was sentenced to death, but the
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He served seven years.
Bowman, now 72, still lives in Bournemouth.
   ``I think I feel more strongly about `Cause Celebre' than any
other piece of work I've done,'' said Mirren. She has starred in
such movies as ``White Nights,'' ``Excalibur,'' ``Age of Consent,''
``The Mosquito Coast,'' ``2010,'' ``The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu
Manchu'' and the new release, ``Pascali's Island.'' She recently
completed an as-yet untitled movie with Paul Scofield.
   She has also acted extensively on the stage in her native
England, where one critic called her the ``sex bomb'' of the Royal
Shakespeare Company.
   ``When you do Shakespeare, as I've done often,'' she said, ``you
work on an epic scale of emotions. But to do all that and know it
actually happened is quite something. Crimes of passion involving
ordinary people are fascinating. You can't identify with
psychopaths, but you get caught up in stories about real people.
You feel a sense of responsibility bringing back to life someone
whose life I feel close to.
   ``I loved Alma. The woman who now lives in her house loves her
in the same way. The only people who reviled her were the people
who didn't know her. People hated Alma because she had an affair
with a man 20 years younger. Women especially were afraid of that
element in her and felt she should be punished.''
   Mirren says her research has convinced her that Alma Rattenbury
did not participate in the murder.
   ``She instigated it because of what she was,'' she said. ``Alma
and George were tried together, but each confessed to the crime and
said the other was innocent. She was tried only because she
confessed in an effort to protect George.''
   The two-hour drama also stars Harry Andrews as Francis
Rattenbury, David Morrissey as George Bowman, David Suchet as the
defense counsel and Norma West as Irene Riggs, Alma's housekeeper
and close friend.
   Mirren lives in the United States, but still visits and works in
England frequently. She grew up in Southend, which she calls
England's Coney Island. Her first job, while still in convent
school, was as a sideshow barker. Her first acting role was Caliban
in ``The Tempest'' at the age of 13.
   ``I still do a lot of theater in England,'' she said. ``I find
it difficult to work on the stage in Los Angeles. They have good
theater, but it's just not a part of the lives of people here. They
think of theater as an audition for television or film. I hate to
see it debased.''
   Mirren also learned to speak with an American accent so that she
could do more films here. She first tried it out in ``The Mosquito
Coast.''
   ``Pascali's Island,'' about the final days of the Ottoman Empire
of Turkey before World War I, was filmed on the Greek island of
Rhodes off the coast of Turkey.
   ``It's an extraordinary part of the world,'' she said. ``You
feel that history so powerfully. Whenever I go on location I like
to take a book that takes place in that part of the world. So I
took some books by Mary Renault. They're set in classical times.
When I did `The Mosquito Coast' in Belize I took along some books
by Joseph Conrad.''
   She spent this past summer in Baton Rouge, La., with a friend
producing a movie. Afterwards, they toured Civil War battlefields
in the South. She didn't say what she took along to read.

<HEAD>Michael Caine Makes American TV Debut in `Jack the Ripper'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Caine, in period costume of long sideburns
and tweed coat, settles into a Victorian chair in the quiet drawing
room of the 18th-century mansion.
   It's an appropriately chilly, rainy London day. But the next
room is blazing bright under the quite 20th-century lights of the
movie company filming CBS' ``Jack the Ripper.''
   The two-part miniseries, airing Friday and Sunday, Oct. 21 and
23, marks the centennial of the grisly, unsolved serial killings.
Writer-director David Wickes used Scotland Yard files that had been
sealed for a century to develop a theory of the killer's identity
that will be revealed at the end of the film.
   The miniseries is Caine's first television role in more than 20
years, his first on American TV.
   The last time he did television at all, Caine recalls, he
co-starred with Christopher Plummer in a British production of
``Hamlet.''
   ``Of course, I didn't play Hamlet in that. This time I do,'' he
says with mock smugness.
   He plays the central character in the drama, Scotland Yard
Inspector Frederick Abberline. The miniseries co-stars Armand
Assante and Jane Seymour.
   Caine said he was completely disinterested in returning to TV
until the miniseries genre came along.
   ``Over a period of time, the miniseries had become a very valid
way of filming things that wouldn't fit into an hour and 50 minutes
or two hours and 10 in the movies,'' he said. ``And so, therefore,
it gained a lot of prestige as far as I was concerned, where you
could do good stuff, rather than just television slop.
   ``I wouldn't have done it if it had been done with five TV
cameras and everybody rushing around trying to change Velcro suits,
because I did all that. That's what I remembered television as,
because I did about a hundred shows, different plays live on
television, and all I remember is a very inefficient nightmare. And
if you remembered all the dialogue you were a genius, never mind if
you got the performance. That didn't make any difference.
   ``Then this script came along, which I liked particularly, and
it was a kind of definitive Jack the Ripper, because we do catch
the guy. There's been a lot of Jack the Ripper movies, but there's
never been an ending. Now we've got the real ending.''
   Jack the Ripper was the nickname for the unknown killer who
stalked and eviscerated five East London prostitutes. The killings
came to an abrupt end on Nov. 9, 1888. The identity of the Ripper,
according to Wickes' theory, will be revealed when the
American-British co-production airs in England Oct. 18. Until then,
even Caine won't know the ending, because Wickes filmed four
different ones.
   Abberline diligently investigated the Ripper case but never made
an arrest. Wickes maintains he was thwarted by a coverup that
extended to the highest offices of the land.
   Caine found Abberline to be ``a very tenacious, bulldog copper,
kind of rough. He wasn't adverse to smacking someone around in the
cells or anything like that to get what he wanted if he figured
they were villains.''
   Caine had recently finished playing another detective, a comical
version of Sherlock Holmes in the movie ``Without a Clue,'' due out
this month. Ben Kingsley plays Watson, who in this premise has
invented Sherlock Holmes as a front. When forced to produce him, he
hires a ne'er-do-well actor (Caine) to play the part.
   Working on ``Without a Clue'' and ``Jack the Ripper'' in England
allowed Caine to help his family adjust to their recent move back
to his homeland after nine years in Los Angeles. Caine, 55, was
born Maurice Micklewhite in a Cockney district of London. He
decided to leave Los Angeles after wearying of the monotonous
weather that prevented him from fully indulging his passion for
gardening.
   Later, Caine was off to the south of France to co-star with
Steve Martin in ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' which he described as
a comedy about two ``not very efficient con men trying to live off
old ladies.''
   In 1987, he starred in two British spy thrillers, ``The Fourth
Protocol,'' for which he was executive producer, and ``The Whistle
Blower.'' He also starred in the critically acclaimed 1983 British
film ``Educating Rita'' and had a supporting role in ``Mona Lisa''
in 1986. But much of Caine's success had been in American movies,
among them ``Too Late the Hero,'' ``The Man Who Would Be King,''
``Sleuth'' and ``Jaws IV _ The Revenge.''
   His supporting role in Woody Allen's 1986 Best Picture ``Hannah
and Her Sisters'' won him his first Oscar after three previous
nominations. Caine said he would like to work with Allen again, but
has no idea if the reclusive director liked him enough to write him
into another film. Even after winning an Academy Award for the
picture?
   ``That doesn't matter to him at all. He doesn't believe in
them,'' Caine said, adding over his shoulder as he headed back to
the set, ``Probably because I won the Oscar he won't give me
another part.''

   An Associated Press correspondent based in

the way many people do on the Aran Islands in Ireland's Galway Bay.
It is one of a series of periodic dispatches by Associated Press

<DATELINE>KILRONAN, Aran Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The people out here in Galway Bay
are often thought of as the most Irish of the Irish. That's because
they haven't changed much from the past even though telephones,
television, tourists and airplanes leave them less isolated.
   An outsider, touring on a bicycle, soon finds that out.
   The ride across Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands,
began brightly at noon but, fittingly Irish, the lowering mist
brought a soft rain that fell ceaselessly until nightfall.
   The sprightly pony traps, two-wheeled carriages, lined up near
the harbor at Kilronan, Inishmore's main village, would have been
more comfortable; so would one of the tour buses that hurtle along
the narrow roads.
   But to get the real flavor of life in the gray labyrinth of
centuries-old limestone walls, the bicycle works best for a
close-up view of the remnants of an ancient Gaelic culture that has
largely vanished on the Irish mainland.
   The incursion of modern appliances has left the 1,300 islanders
largely unchanged and the government keeps the Irish language alive
here by paying families to speak it.
   The playwright J.M. Synge, who made his reputation with his rich
dialogue sketches of Aran peasant life, wrote in 1907 that here
``one is forced to believe in a sympathy between man and nature.''
   The Aran archipelago _ Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer _
stretches across the mouth of Galway Bay in western Ireland. It
attracts a steady flow of visitors _ ``strainseiri'' (strangers) to
the islanders.
   When Christianity was dawning in Ireland, the islands were a
retreat for ascetics and scholars, and even today, schoolchildren,
academics and civil servants arrive every summer to immerse
themselves among the islanders.
   The treeless landscape of rain-polished limestone is strewn with
granite boulders, scored with deep fissures, adorned with 437 known
species of wild flowers. The walls separating patches of green
pasture are stippled with orange lichen.
   The land, bounded by wave-pounded craggy cliffs, is littered
with prehistoric forts, crosses, stone huts and ecclesiastical
ruins. Inishmore has one main road.
   ``There's nothing on Inishmore but scenery and people,'' said
Doreen Meagher, a Dublin drama teacher who has owned a house here
since 1967. ``There's nothing laid on for you, no hurdy-gurdy, no
concerts or theater _ just fresh air, unpolluted water, lovely
scenery.
   ``They're a race apart and will never integrate,'' she said of
the islanders. ``They're frightfully clannish. They must have got a
talking-to by the tourist board _ they're more friendly this year
than they have been.''
   Indeed, the islanders seem to have plenty to say, often
switching from Irish to English in mid-sentence. The government
pays child and housing allowances to families whose children are
fluent in Irish.
   While Aran traditions might be under assault, the strong
community spirit remains intact. Fishermen still use currachs,
canvas-covered boats, or fish from the high cliffs with twine on a
stick.
   But no longer do they clamber down cliffs at night to snatch
sleeping puffins for their feathers. Aran sweaters are still
handknitted, and snapped up by tourists. But the brown-sailed
``hookers'' that carried turf from Connemara are gone, as are the
rope makers, basket weavers and coopers.
   Most people still live off fishing and farming, but tourism is
slowly filling Kilronan with bed-and-breakfast guesthouses,
restaurants, gift shops and pubs named Lucky Star or American Bar,
where Budweiser beer is available alongside Irish stout.
   A civic hall offers the tourists daily screenings of ``Man of
Aran,'' the vivid 1934 portrait of Inishmore by Robert Flaherty, an
American pioneer of film documentary.
   On the smaller island of Inishmaan stands ``Synge's Chair,''
slabs of rock arranged on the cliffside spot where the playwright
had written of ``perpendicular cliffs under my ankles and over me
innumerable gulls that chase each other in a white cirrus of
wings.''
   Once on the eight-mile uphill road out of Kilronan, the
windswept barrenness becomes complete. Visitors walk the last mile
of rocky land to Dun Aenghus, a prehistoric fort with three
concentric enclosures on the edge of a 300-foot cliff, where the
relentless rain seeps through every layer of clothing.
   The fort's keeper had retreated to Diriane's pub where, between
sips of Guinness stout, he taught two soaked German tourists to say
``It's a wet day'' in Irish: ``Is la fliuch e'' (pronounced iss law
floo-uck ay).
   In the American Bar, 85-year-old Antoine O'Briain welcomed a
newcomer with a knuckle-bumpy handshake.
   ``In my youth, we always used to be out on the ocean,'' he said.
Speaking Irish through an interpreter, he recalled how in World War
II German U-boats would surface inside rings of currachs to evade
radar detection by British warships, and U-boat crews would be fed
tea and sandwiches.
   ``There isn't anybody here who hasn't had someone who drowned,''
said lobsterman Michael Joyce, 35.
   Four of his 13 classmates have died at sea, but Joyce said he
would live nowhere else, because only here can he raise his four
children his own way.
   ``Here, it's a whole village,'' he said. ``If you have a
problem, you tell it to the first person you meet in the morning.''
   Breandan O hEithir, 58, welcomes the modern conveniences:
electricity, TV, telephones, motorcycles in place of donkeys.
   ``What I see vanishing is picturesque stuff that appeals to
tourists, but really the people are surprisingly unchanged in their
attitudes,'' said O hEithir, an Inishmore native and columnist for
the Irish Times, a Dublin-based national newspaper.
   In his youth, the highlight was the arrival of the Galway ferry
on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Now, ferryboats make the 10-mile
crossing from Connemara every hour or two, and Aer Arann flies
daily to all the islands.
   ``It can be black enough, the whole business of isolation,'' O
hEithir said. ``But the isolation is gone now and that's a good
thing.''

   For the first time since the 1970s, automakers
are back in the business of making cars and trucks with a
vengeance, and their offerings for 1989 show it.
   Performance, handling, and wind-cheating styling are required
just to get into the game.
   For 1989, engines are fuel-injected, turbocharged, supercharged,
multivalved or just plain bigger and faster. Many cars have
anti-lock braking, a computerized system that prevents lockup;
advanced suspension systems aimed at a variety of driving tastes;
more responsive four-speed automatic transmissions and styling that
makes the large and small econoboxes of the early 1980s nothing
more than a bad memory.
   Buyers looking for plain, basic transportation can still find
it. But for 1989, the pure pleasure of driving is once again a key
factor in the automotive equation.
   Here are highlights of what's new for 1989:
   GENERAL MOTORS=
   CHEVROLET: Chevy's imports _ the Suzuki-made Sprint minicar,
Isuzu-built Spectrum subcompact and Toyota-GM Nova, along with the
new Suzuki Tracker sport-utility vehicle _ will be sold under the
lineup name Geo at Chevrolet dealerships beginning in 1989. Geo is
the result of Chevy's various attempts to sell imports to buyers
who don't usually shop its dealers. For 1989, the three-cylinder,
50 mpg Sprint becomes the Metro and the Toyota Corolla-based Nova
becomes the Prizm.
   During 1989, Chevrolet will get its first member of the GM-10
midsize car family, a four-door called Lumina. Chevrolet's midsize
Corsica sedan, introduced as a 1988 model, gets a hatch-back
version with fold-down rear seat for 1989. Another option, the LTZ
touring sedan, has a 130-horsepower, 2.8-liter V6 engine and sport
suspension.
   The Cavalier subcompact will be the first car with GM's
so-called ``self-aligning'' steering wheel, which sits on legs that
collapse on impact, flattening the wheel against the driver's torso
to evenly distribute impact force and reduce chest injuries.
   The big 22-year-old, rear-drive 1989 Caprice full-size sedan
comes with a 5.0-liter V8 engine and air conditioning.
   For 1989, Chevy's Corvette sports car gets the most powerful
small-block V8 ever at 5.7 liters, a six-speed manual transmission,
bigger wheels and, on the Z51 performance model, adjustable
suspension. Convertibles will get an optional removable hard-top.
   Like most of its competitors, Chevy's compact S-10 pickup trucks
and Blazer sport-utility vehicles come with standard rear anti-lock
brakes for 1989. Big 4.3-liter, V6 engines are offered on both.
Chevy full-size pickups and Astro rear-wheel-drive compact van also
get rear anti-lock brakes.
   PONTIAC: The Grand Prix coupe, Pontiac's GM10 model, starts the
model year with a 2.8-liter V6 engine, upgraded to a 3.1-liter
engine later in 1989. Air conditioning is standard. Also later,
Pontiac will offer a limited-edition McLaren Turbo Grand Prix, with
a turbocharged 3.1-liter engine and automatic transmission and
anti-lock brakes, both standard.
   Anti-lock brakes also are available on the Pontiac Bonneville
sedan, which has GM's 3.8-liter, 165-horsepower V6 engine on all
versions.
   Pontiac's Grand Am, its best-selling model, is slightly restyled
for 1989. Engine choices, all four-cylinder, include a 2.5-liter, a
turbo-charged 2.0-liter and a 16-valve 2.3-liter.
   For 1989, the 20th anniversary for the Trans Am sports coupe,
Pontiac is offering a limited edition with a turbo 3.8-liter,
250-horsepower engine, automatic four-speed transmission and white
exterior.
   OLDSMOBILE: In mid-1989, Oldsmobile's GM10, the Cutlass Supreme,
also gets the 3.1-liter V6 engine. Anti-lock brakes are standard on
the Trofeo coupe and Touring Sedan and optional on Toronado,
Ninety-Eight and Cutlass Supreme. Oldsmoile also offers
International Series versions of Cutlass Cierra and Cutlass Supreme
and Cutlass Calais, more powerful engines than the base models,
computerized driver information systems and, on the Supreme, a
compact-disc player.
   BUICK: Buick's Riviera coupe and midsize Century are restyled
and Riviera is longer and more graceful. Century gets an optional
3.8-liter V6 engine. Later in the year, Buick moves further upscale
with the Park Avenue Ultra. Ultra will have an all-leather interior
and power front seats. Regal, Buick's GM10, shares the 3.1-liter
engine with its sisters at mid-year and an optional CD player. All
Buick models will have Dynaride suspension, which Buick says is
more responsive while still offering a smooth boulevard ride.
   CADILLAC: ``Bigger is better'' is the motto of GM's luxury-car
division, which has lengthened both the Fleetwood and DeVille for
1989. Allante, the nearly $60,000, Italian-bodied convertible
coupe, has a more powerful 4.5-liter V8 engine, shared with the
rest of the lineup. Allante also has sportier handling and larger
wheels with a self-adjusting suspension system. Other goodies
include a rapid-melt windshield option, personalized remote entry
system and a rear-view mirror that automatically adjusts itself to
glare from other vehicles' headlights.
   FORD=
   FORD: The big news is the sleeker, lower all-new Thunderbird
midsize coupe. The 1989 image model is the Thunderbird Super Coupe,
replacing last year's Turbo Coupe. The Super Coupe is
super-charged, a mechanical system that unlike turbo-charging gives
the engine extra boost at all times rather than only after reaching
highway speed. It also has big, easy-to-read, black-and-white
analog dashboard gauges. The 1989 T-bird has four-wheel independent
suspension, automatic adjustable suspension and a 3.8-liter V6
engine. Options include anti-lock brakes and a compact disc player.

   Ford introduced another 1989 model, the Mazda-engineered and
Mazda-built Ford Probe, in May. The two-door hatchback has a
standard three-valve-per-cylinder, four-cylinder 2.2-liter engine
with an optional turbo-charged 2.2-liter GT version. Transmission
is five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. The GT also has
automatic adjustable suspension, fog lamps and optional anti-lock
brakes and CD player. This reasonably priced car has been sold out
for months and Mazda is squeezing all it can from its Flat Rock
assembly plant.
   Ford also will offer a high-performance version of its Taurus
midsize sedan later in the year. The Taurus SHO _ for Super High
Output _ will have a 24-valve, 3.0-liter, 220-horsepower
fuel-injected V6 engine developed by Ford and Yamaha, five-speed
manual transmission, standard air conditioning and other touches.
   Ford has restyled its Ranger compact pickup and Bronco II
compact sport-utility vehicle for 1989. Both get standard rear
anti-lock brakes and a new 2.3-liter dual-spark plug engine.
   LINCOLN-MERCURY: The 1989 Mercury Cougar shares all features of
the Thunderbird, and like the Super Coupe, the high-performance
Cougar XR7 is supercharged. The 1989 Lincoln Continental luxury
sedan will be the first domestic-made car with airbags on both the
driver and passenger side. The '89 Lincoln Mark VII coupe has a
5.0-liter, 225-horsepower V8, anti-lock brakes and keyless entry
system.
   CHRYSLER=
   CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH: After nearly a decade, Chrysler is replacing
its venerable, stodgy, fuel-efficient front-wheel-drive K-car with
the more updated Plymouth Acclaim. Acclaim is a roomy, if sparse,
four-door family sedan with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine
and optional 2.5-liter turbo or 3.0-liter V6 with four-speed
automatic transmission. Acclaim's styling is smoother and more
rounded than the K-cars but still conservative. Its suspension
includes gas struts and provides increased control and comfort.
   Chrysler also adds an optional turbo-charged four-cylinder
engine for is Voyager minivan along with the existing optional V6
by Mitsubishi.
   Plymouth's Mitsubishi import, the Colt, is completely restyled
for increased aerodynamics. The two-door Colt hatchback has an
optional turbo-charged engine.
   Plymouth also will get a sporty, Probe-fighting Laser subcompact
coupe during 1989. Laser will be made at Diamond-Star, a joint
venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   DODGE: Dodge's version of the Acclaim is the Spirit. Dodge also
shares the Colt and sells it under the same name. Like Voyager, the
Caravan minivan gets an optional turbo engine. Most Dodge trucks
get standard rear anti-lock brakes. A new 5.9-liter, in-line
6-cylinder Cummins diesel engine is optional on many 1989 full-size
Ram trucks. The Mitsubishi-built Raider sport-utility vehicle gets
an optional six-cylinder engine. The Dakota midsize truck also gets
a more powerful engine for 1989.
   JEEP-EAGLE: The Mitsubishi-built Summit sedan (a version of the
Mitsubishi Mirage) joins the Eagle lineup. For 1989, Jeep Cherokee
and Wagoneer have optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, while
Wrangler comes in a new Islander version that offers bright new
colors and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder or 4.2-liter six-cylinder
engine. Jeep-Eagle also will get a version of the Plymouth Laser,
possibly in 1989.
   NISSAN: Two new models will allow Nissan to re-enter the
competition. The rear-wheel-drive 240SX sports coupe has a
multi-valve four-cylinder engine and comes in notchback and
fastback versions. The upscale Maxima sedan gets a V6 engine and a
Nissan-Bose sound system, optional on some versions. Both offer
options including heads-up display, which projects critical
dashboard information such as speed onto the windshield so the
driver doesn't have to refocus by looking from the road to the
gauges.
   MAZDA: 1989 offerings include a rear-wheel-drive minivan.
   MITSUBISHI: Chrysler's Japanese partner will sell two all-new
products through its own dealerships. The 1989 Mirage is a
subcompact sedan that has an optional turbo-charged, 16-valve
four-cylinder engine. The Galant is a compact upscale sedan; its
top model has a 16-valve engine and electronically controlled
suspension, along with optional anti-lock brakes. In early 1989,
Mitsubishi will introduce its Diamond-Star Eclipse sporty coupe as
a 1990 model.
   Mitsubishi's new four-door Montero compact sport-utility vehicle
has a V6 engine and four-wheel-drive. It is longer and wider than
its two-door predecessor, which also gets a the 3.0-liter V6 that
Mitsubishi shares with Chrysler.
   PEUGEOT: The French automaker is fighting for a U.S. comeback
with two luxury-oriented models, the new front-wheel-drive 405
midsize sedan and the larger, restyled 505 sedan and station wagon.
Engines on the 405, Europe's Car of the Year for 1988, include a
four-cylinder multi-valve version. The 505 comes with
four-cylinder, V6 or turbo-charged four-cylinder engines. Anti-lock
brakes are standard on most 505 models and optional on some 405s.
   PORSCHE: The German luxury-sports car maker adds anti-lock
braking, Blaupunkt digital cassette stereo, electric-tilt removable
sunroof, central locking and alarm system and electric seat
adjustment as standard equipment on its 944, 944 S2 and 944 Turbo
models. The alarm system and other touches also come on 911 and 928
models.
   VOLKSWAGEN=
   AUDI: Audi replaces its 5000 luxury sedan line with the 100 and
200 series, both available in a Quattra all-wheel-drive version.
All have five-cylinder engines, with a 130-horsepower version on
the 100 and 162-horsepower edition on the 200. All Audi models,
including the smaller 80 and 90 sport sedans, now come with the
``Audi Advantage,'' a package that includes a three-year
bumper-to-bumper warranty, free routine maintenance for three years
and guaranteed trade-in value.
   VOLKSWAGEN: VW brings three new models from Europe during 1989.
The aerodynamic, all-wheel-drive Passat midsize family sedan and
wagon, the wide-track GTI Rally specialty performance hatchback and
the Corrado, a $20,000 sports car all will reach these shores
during 1989 but probably sell as 1990 models.

   With little advertising and less fanfare, the
Ford Probe is speeding through dealer showrooms, keeping most
buyers waiting at least six weeks for delivery of a car that may be
carving its own market niche.
   Since its formal introduction last May, the Probe, built beside
the Mazda MX-6 at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA Corp.'s Flat Rock
plant south of Detroit, is being sold three months in advance of
assembly line runs, Ford Motor Co. analyst Ray Windecker said.
   Delivery time can vary depending on what kind and color
automobile a customer wants.
   The American car-buying public got a dose of what Ford had in
mind months before its formal introduction. The news media,
specifically the automotive magazines, sang the car's praises.
   ``By the time the cars were introduced, more than one-third of
the car-buying age populous was aware of the car,'' Windecker said.
   ``I don't think there's been that much excitement about a
domestic car since a Taurus,'' another Ford that was introduced in
December 1985, said Beth Fusco, an auto analyst with Moody's
Investor Services in New York City.
   ``They did a lot of advance promotion for the car in
magazines,'' she said. ``I thought that was a pretty sophisticated
send-off. I think they did a good job promoting it, and I think the
car is selling itself.''
   Probe's base price is $11,490 with a 2.2 liter, four-cylinder
engine. The car, with hidden headlamps and a swept-back rear deck,
can be upgraded with a turbocharged engine and option packages to
$17,292.
   Earlier this summer, scores of Probes reached the end of the
assembly line at Flat Rock needing repairs.
   Mazda quality control manager James G. Bouck said the quality
problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant _
a joint-venture between Ford and Mazda _ and some workers were
retrained and moved from one shift to another.
   Bouck, who moved to Mazda from General Motors Corp., said Mazda
has more stringent quality demands that some other automakers. That
can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped
to dealers.
   ``Our repair inventory is about 300 now,'' he said, calling it
an expected number.
   Probe sales have grown at a steady clip _ about 600 cars more
are sold each month than in the preceding one. No one at Ford would
reveal projected sales figures, but Windecker said demand has
outstripped those projections.
   It's too early to tell exactly where Probe will fit into the
American car market.
   ``They are creating a different niche for themselves,'' Fusco
said. But, she cautioned, ``I think you have to be really careful
when you're creating a niche.
   ``Look what GM did with Fiero,'' she said, referring to the
Pontiac two-seater that sold well in its first few years on the
market before falling off dramatically. GM stopped making the car
earlier this year.
   Analysts said the Probe has capitalized on the No. 2 and most
profitable automaker's strengths _ solid design, careful marketing
and reliability.
   ``They have done many things right,'' said Richard Henderson, an
analyst with the Pershing Division of Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette in New York City. ``It's a combination of many, many
little factors, some borrowed from Europe, some from North America
and some borrowed from Mazda.
   ``Combine that with a nice fit in its product mix ... and you've
got a very successful car,'' Henderson said.
   Like other newly introduced cars, Probe's engineering initially
may take a back seat to its looks.
   ``What is there out there in that price range that looks that
neat?'' asked Fusco. ``I think people buy cars because they look
good, and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty
is good.''
   Like other Fords, Probe carries a one-year bumper-to-bumper
warranty and a six-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.

   The nation's automakers and suppliers are
offering a growing array of anti-theft devices in an effort to stem
the growing number of stolen vehicles.
   Most of the devices marketed by the Big Three, Honda, Mazda,
Nissan and Toyota involve alarms that honk the horn and flash the
headlights to scare off a would-be car thief. Others systems
disengage starter motors.
   Most of the devices supplied by automakers as standard equipment
come on the maker's more expensive cars. The systems are optional
on many less-expensive models.
   Then there are devices that an owner can pick up at a local auto
parts store _ things that fit around the steering column like a big
doughnut, menacing-looking hooks that lock the steering wheel to
the brake pedal, and still other systems that detect motion and
sound, such as breaking glass.
   Despite all the technology put into anti-theft systems by
automakers and parts suppliers, there was a 5.3 percent rise in the
number of car thefts in the nation from 1986 to 1987, the latest
annual figures available from the FBI.
   And the National Auto Theft Bureau in Chicago says while those
devices may stymie thieves, most of the cars stolen nowadays fall
into two categories _ cars in which keys were left in the ignition
and cars that were simply towed away.
   ``Approximately 13 percent of the recovered (stolen) vehicles
still had the owner's keys in the vehicles ...'' said Tim Kett of
the organization. ``About 10 percent of the vehicles were towed.
This is a common technique used (by thieves) in urban areas.''
   When tow trucks aren't used by thieves, there are a variety of
products offered outside dealerships designed to keep a driver's
car where the driver left it.
   Collars that cover ignition switches and joints in steering
columns can prevent the plastic covering from being easily removed,
exposing wiring for the column controls, including the ignition.
   Alarms that sound when a door is pried open when windows are
smashed or when the car moves also are available.
   Motion detectors have caused some headaches, especially in
heavily urban areas, when they can be activated by a nudge from a
passerby or another vehicle, for instance.
   Aaron Lowe, director of government affairs for the Vehicle
Security Association, a trade organization for makers and marketers
of alarm and vehicle protection systems, said the security industry
is beginning to make more sophisticated and less-sensitive motion
detectors.
   There are some systems available in the after-market which can
alert a driver through a pager that someone may be trying to get
into a car. There are systems which interrupt the electrical or
fuel systems when a door, hood or trunk is opened.
   ``There are a wide range of things a consumer can get, depending
on where they are and what they want to protect,'' Lowe said.

   The likelihood of injury from a car accident
ranges widely among different car models, but for the most part
safety increases with automobile size, according to an insurance
industry report.
   The report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows
that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records, while
station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection.
   According to the insurance group, the Mercedes-Benz SDL-SEL
sedan, which is equipped with a driver-side airbag, had the best
safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than
the average for all cars. Close behind was the Pontiac Safari
station wagon.
   The least safe car was the 4-door Chevrolet Spectrum which had
injury losses that were 78 percent above average, followed by the
4-door Chevrolet Sprint and 4-door Hyundai Excel, both of which had
losses 67 percent above average, the report said.
   Of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record, nine were
categorized as ``large'' cars including five station wagons and
vans. The Saab 9000 was the only ``mid-size'' car in the top 10
vehicles, ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower
than average.
   The 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in
the small sedan or small sports car category.
   Exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least
protection include another Saab model, the Saab 900, as well as the
Volkswagen Vanagon, the Toyota van, Porsche 944 coupe and Mercedes
Benz 380-560 SL convertible. All are in the ``small'' category but
had better than average injury loss records.
   But except for the Saab 900, all 60 of the ``small'' sedan
models had higher injury losses than average.
   The report by the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
industry research group, covered 1985-87 model cars, but spokesmen
said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles
as well.
   ``The loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model
year to another,'' said Brian O'Neill, the institute's president.
   The report said the results were adjusted to take into account
various ``non-vehicle factors'' such as types and ages of drivers
that might be associated with particular vehicles.
   The 2-door Chevrolet Cavalier was the only mid-size car to have
``substantially worse than average'' injury losses _ 36 percent
worse than average for all vehicles.
   All but two of the 35 ``large'' cars, station wagons, vans and
speciality cars had lower than average injury losses. The 4-door
Oldsmobile Delta 88 and Cadillac Fleetwood-Deville were the
exceptions, ranked as average.
   Of the 207 cars and vans included in the study, 40 had safety
records that were characterized as ``substantially better'' than
average, while 32 were ``substantially worse.''

   Here are the cars ranked as having
``substantially better'' and ``substantially worse'' injury loss
records, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute, an insurance
industry research group.
   These vehicles have injury loss records of at least 30 percent
greater or 30 percent less than the average for the 207 vehicles
examined.
   The number in parenthesis after each vehicle represents the
relative injury loss rate. The lower the number the better the loss
rate; 100 is the average for all vehicles. For example, a 40 would
mean a loss rate of 60 percent below average. A 140 would be a loss
rate of 40 percent greater than average.

   Driving speed will not have much effect on tire performance or
wear, according to test engineers at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.
   ``In terms of getting from point A to point B, the increase in
speed will compress the time needed to make the trip, but it won't
have any appreciable effect on either tire wear or performance,
unless you engage in sharp cornering, braking or similar maneuvers
at high speed,'' says Walt DeVinney, director of tire testing.
   Goodyear also had this advice:
   _ ``Cold'' air pressure readings on your tires should not exceed
the maximum air pressure specified on the tire sidewall, 35 pounds
per square inch on most cars. Tire inflation checks should be made
often.
   _ Tires on automobiles and light trucks should be rotated at
6,000 to 8,000 miles and again at 18,000 to 24,000 miles, except
when the manufacturer advises otherwise. Rotation usually will mean
more even treadwear, says Goodyear.
   _ All four tires should be of the same type of construction,
except winter tires on drive wheels, or temporary spares supplied
with the wheels.
   _ If replacing tires and you need only two, mount the newest and
best-treaded on the drive wheels.

   With winter, and its rain, snow, sleet and sub-freezing
temperatures in the offing, car care becomes especially important.
   Motorists are advised to have a professional technician check
for signs of wear on the car.
   Walt Alley, director of training at the Midas Insitute of
Technology in Palatine, Ill., suggests checking these car service
areas:
   _ Brakes. Checks brake pads and shoes for wear.
   _ Exhaust system. Look for holes in the muffler, exhaust or
tailpipe.
   _ Oil and lube. Use the proper winter weight motor oil and give
your car a lube job to help protect suspension and steering parts.
   _ Shocks. Worn-out shock absorbers can hinder braking,
especially during sudden stops, and allow excessive body rolls on
curves.
   Alley also suggests assembling a ``winter survival'' kit to keep
in the trunk, to include booster cables, shovel, tow chain, rock
salt or sand, emergency flares, flashlight, and first-aid kit.
   Racing driver Alan Kulwicki advises car owners also check tires,
the gas tank _ running out of gas and flat tires and the two
leading non-mechanical causes of highway breakdowns, he says _ and
antifreeze.
   ``Check your antifreeze to make sure both that you have enough
and that the system is clean,'' says Kulwicki, who drives his own
racing cars for the Zerex racing team. ``A good habit to get into
is to check the antifreeze every time you check the oil, especially
if you've been driving hard.
   ``Always be sure the ignition is off and the engine cold when
opening the radiator,'' he says.
   If the coolant looks dirty, he says, have the cooling system
flushed and replace the antifreeze. If the level is low, add some.
   A 50-50 mix of antifreeze and water usually provides the best
protection against overheating, Kulwicki says.

   Many motorists who wear seat belts are still
exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly,
according to a federal study that says women, children and
motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk.
   The National Transportation Safety Board study raised questions
bout the way some belt users wear the safety devices after
examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted.
   Twenty-one percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much
slack in the shoulder harnesses, and 7 percent of the occupants,
often children, wore belts that were improperly routed behind the
back or under an arm.
   Thirty-one states have laws requiring use of safety belts. But
NTSB Chairman Jim Burnett said, ``We have a lot of misuse and that
problem has to be tackled.''
   Overall, the safety board said, lap-shoulder belts provide
excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants
suffering minor or no injuries. But the study suggested the results
could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of
belts.
   The NTSB study was not a random sample and, therefore, does not
necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists,
said Lynne Smith, who was involved in writing of the report. But,
she added, the data are consistent with previous findings of
widespread misuse.
   The four-member safety board urged the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration to require that safety belts meet standards
for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt
systems be equipped with a ``pre-tension'' device that
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash.
   The safety board questioned the widespread use among U.S.
carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt
out to its full length without it automatically retracting. Most
foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps
the belt snug against the occupant, but which has been criticized
as being less comfortable and, therefore, less likely to be used.
   The safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged
50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to
misuse belts, especially wearing them too loosely. Ms. Smith said
that, generally, slack equal to no more than the width of a fist
should be allowed in the shoulder belt.
   A particularly high misuse of belts was found among children.
One-third had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm.
   ``Such misuse ... seriously degrades the protective capabilities
of the lap-shoulder belt, reducing it to a lap-only belt with
inferior crash protection,'' the safety board said.
   NHTSA, which issues auto safety regulations, was reviewing the
NTSB report, said spokeswoman Betsy Tyson.

   Cars, pickups, jeeps, trucks, recreation vehicles _ and now,
conversion vans.
   One more option in considering wheels in an auto-conscious
country is the conversion van, a full-size utility and minivan that
is shipped without windows and seats and such and then converted to
a passenger vehicle.
   Some van converters start with a sheet metal box, a motor and
wheels and add seating, sidewalls, insulation, wiring, seat belts,
wood trim, radios and TVs, windows, and exterior trim.
   Conversion van sales increased 13 percent in 1987, according to
the Automotive News.
   ``We posted a 38 percent increase and are projecting even
greater interest in the 1989 model year,'' says William T. Becker,
vice president of marketing, advertising and consumer relations for
Glaval Inc., an Elkhart, Ind., conversion company.

   The 1929 Duesenberg J., the 1931 Bugatti Royale and the 1928
Isotta Fraschini are among the 12 classic automobiles in the
Franklin Mint Precision Model collection.
   Model-makers at the Franklin Mint near Philadelphia sculptured
prototypes of the luxury cars on a 1:43 scale, noting details
inside and out, including tiny instruments and gauges on the
dashboards.
   Matching dies were made for each of the components, at least 50
parts for each model, which was then painted and hand-polished.
   Among the models is that of the 1931 Bugatti Royale, which
weighed in a 7,150 pounds and now valued at more than $8 million,
with some estimates over $20 million.
   Tom Monaghan, whose businesses include Domino's Pizza and the
Detroit Tigers baseball team, paid $8.1 million in 1986 for one of
six Bugatti Royales ever manufactured, said to be the only one not
housed in a museum.

   The name game was played at the recent Greater New York
International Automobile Show: Would a car by any other name sell
as well?
   Can you guess where the names come from?
   Volkswagen Jetta was named after the jetstream, as the Scirocco
came from the Italian for a North African wind, and the Golf from
the German ``golfstrom,'' for gulfstream.
   Celestial bodies were the source for the Toyota Corolla, the
sun's outer edge, and the Subaru Alcyone, part of the star cluster
Pleiades (which adorns the Subaru hood).
   The Bentley Mulsanne S was named for the Mulsanne straightaway
at Le Mans, site of five Bentley racing wins, and a region in
southern France inspired the Rolls-Royce Corniche.
   A more scientific approach is taken by NameLabs, a San
Francisco-based consulting firm that sorts through thousands of
morphenes _ a small, meaningful word part _ to create an image the
automaker wants to project. The company has blended word parts to
come up with names like Sentra and Acura, among others.
   Then, of course, there's Henry Ford's choice, the Edsel, named
after his son.

   Texans seem to be driven by stronger passions
than the rest of the nation when it comes to cars and trucks,
according to a new survey. They like pickups, custom paint jobs,
car telephones and big hood ornaments.
   ``The survey throughout the whole country shows that cars are
important in other areas, but Texans really seem to be turned on
about their cars,'' said Rick Williams, a marketing specialist for
Chevron U.S.A. Inc., which commissioned the survey.
   ``The freewheeling tradition that people like Sam Houston and
Davy Crockett carved out years ago continues to this day,''
Williams said.
   The telephone survey, taken in late May, questioned more than
1,000 Americans, roughly half men and half women.
   Participants were asked to pick the vehicle they wanted from
several choices given and to rate how well their choice fit their
lifestyle.
   Another question listed several areas such as performance, fuel
economy, appearance and maintenance asked people to rate how
important it was.
   A third listed several things, such as the hood ornament, and
asked how much each appealed.
   Among Texans, 50 percent found a luxury car like a Cadillac fit
their lifestyle at least moderately well. That's nearly 10
percentage points more than Americans overall.
   Texans also favored utility vehicles (72.3 percent vs. 50.6
percent), pickup trucks (71.2 vs. 53.2), sports cars (40 vs. 33.6)
and basic American sedans (67.6 vs. 63.7).
   On the other hand, 39.6 percent of Americans found European
luxury sedans like a Mercedes very well-suited to their lifestyle,
while 37.8 percent of Texans surveyed agreed.
   Some 37.2 percent of Texas drivers love their car phones, the
survey found, while the devices found favor with 20.6 percent of
Americans overall. Custom paint work was favored by 20.2 percent of
the Texans, while only 12.7 percent of Americans found the paint
mattered a lot.
   Overall, 9.2 percent of respondents said they liked ornate hood
ornaments, while 14.5 percent of Texans replied in the affirmative.
   The margin of error for the overall survey was plus or minus 3
percent; a higher margin of error would apply to subgroups like
Texans.

   It is too early to say whether higher speed limits on rural
interstate highways are unsafe, but preliminary figures show only a
1 percentage point difference in traffic fatality rates, the
Transportation Department reported. The department said that during
the first nine months of 1987, traffic fatalities on highways with
the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlier in the 37
states that had adopted the higher speed, compared with a 17
percent increase in 11 states that had not.
   However, ``The 65 mph speed limit has not been in effect long
enough to determine its long-term impact on safety,'' said the
report to Congress, required by a law allowing states to exempt
some rural highways from the 55 mph national speed limit.
   Most of the states raised their speed limits in April and May of
last year. Arizona, California, Louisiana and New Mexico accounted
for 70 percent of the fatality increase in states that raised the
rural speed limit, the study said.
   From Jan. 1, 1987, to the time of the speed limit change,
fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period a
year earlier. After the speed limit was raised through Sept. 30,
1987, fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier, the
study said.
   The increase was statistically meaningful, but the study
cautioned against applying it to broad conclusions about the
long-term effects of the higher speed limit.
   While Americans debate the pros and cons of a 55-mph speed
limit, most West Europeans legally drive much faster than that, and
they've been doing so with a lower fatality rate than the United
States.
   West Germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system
known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules,
such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes.
   Elsewhere in Western Europe, speed limits range from 86.6 mph in
Italy to 55 mph in Ireland, which does not have an extensive
superhighway system.
   The latest statistics of the 12-nation European Economic
Community, for 1986, when a uniform 55-mph limit was still in
effect in the United States, indicate a highway fatality rate of
14.4 per 100,000 population in contrast to 19.9 in the United
States that year.
   The 1986 highway death toll for EEC nations, with a total
population of 320 million, was 46,046; in the United States, with a
popultion fo 242 million, the motor vehicle fatalities numbered
47,900.
   This past March, however, the U.S. Department of Transportation
said traffic fatalities in the United States for 1987 were the
lowest in history, as measured by 100 million miles of travel. It
put the rate by that measurement at 2.4 deaths compared to 2.5 in
1986, 3.3 in 1980 and 24.08 in 1921, the first year the calculation
was made.
   The department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving.
   Seat belts are required in most West European countries, as they
are in 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Italy plans to
require seat belts by September, 1989.
   Many European countries also have stiff penalties for drunken
driving.

   Safety will be among the choices new car buyers will have this
year, according to the National Coalition to Reduce Car Crash
Injuries.
   Air bags and anti-lock brakes are two of the major safety
devices that many manufacturers are offering. Three-point rear seat
belts will also be more commonplace this model year, the Coalition
points out.
   Eleven of the world's 17 largest automobile manufacturers will
offer inflatable air restraint systems as either standard or
optional equipment, according to a study conducted by Ralph Nader,
consumer advocate.
   Four other manufacturers have committed to air bags beginning in
1990 and General Motors _ which offers them as options on the Delta
88 _ says it will offer 3 million cars with air bags by 1992.
   Anti-lock brakes were offered as standard or optional equipment
by 17 of 23 auto manufacturers recently surveyed by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.
   Cary Corbin, Coalition coordinator, says most auto manufacturers
are phasing in standard rear seat shoulder harnesses in the 1989
model year and by model year 1990, virtually all cars sold in the
United States will have shoulder belts for the back seat.

   ``Comparison shopping'' for an auto insurer can result in
sharply reduced insurance costs.
   ``While all auto insurance policies may appear similar, quite
the opposite is true,'' says Charles F. Wright, assistant vice
president, Aetna Life & Casualty, ``and a smart consumer can often
save hundreds of dollars.
   Some of the money-saving discounts offered by various companies,
he says, include:
   _ A ``total account'' credit to those who insure both car and
home with the same company. The credit differs from state to state,
Wright says, but is usually 10 percent off the auto premium, or 5
percent off both auto and homeowner premiums.
   _ Some companies offer a ``first accident forgiveness'' which,
after five continous accident-free years, guarantees that rates
will not go up after a first at-fault accident.
   _ Car pool commuters often qualify for discounts.
   _ Installing anti-theft devices in your car may qualify you for
a discount. ``A 5 percent credit is typical for an alarm-only
device or an active disabling mechanism which prevents the car from
starting,'' says Wright. Some companies offer a 10 percent credit
for a passive disabling device that automatically prevents the car
from starting.
   _ You can save money by insuring children who drive infrequently
because they are away at school on the parents' policy rather than
separately.
   _ Check the companies that make discounts available to females
between 30 and 64 years old who are the only drivers in the
household.
   _ Good driver discounts are offered by some companies to drivers
with accident-and-violation free records and to motorists driving
fewer than a certain number of miles a year.
   _ Some states require discounts be given to drivers who take
driver training or defensive driving courses.
   _ Drivers still at school may be entitled to a ``good student
discount'' program by maintaining a high scholastic average.

   A new, easier to read road map of Texas denotes major cities in
type more than one-quarter inch high, with small town names more
than twice as large as national road atlases.
   The 203-page Texas Road Atlas and Recreation Directory, which
has 79 pges of large-scale sectional maps of the state, is produced
by Rand McNally's Austin, Texas, branch.
   ``Our Austin cartographic people didn't make the maps at such
large scale because we thought Texans had more eye problems than
the rest of the country,'' said Michael Dobson, director of
catographic services for Rand McNally. ``Rather, it's because the
population is aging throughout the country.
   ``Also, everyone at times has to read maps under dim lighting
conditions. Under the dome light of a car or truck at night, for
example. The only practicl format for such easy-to-read maps is a
state atlas,'' he said.

   Frustrated by the pokey performance of the stock
and bond markets lately? You won't get much sympathy from fans of
another staple investment, gold.
   The price of gold, which was hovering in the range of $450 to
$460 per troy ounce heading into the summer, made news recently
when it slipped below $400 for the first time in more than a year
and a half.
   The timing of this weak showing made it especially hard for
gold's admirers to swallow.
   First of all, it came against a background of widespread
inflation worries, which were given voice by no less an authority
than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Gold is
supposed to thrive on inflation fears.
   Secondly, gold has not benefited from all the shakeup investor
confidence has suffered through in the nearly 12 months since the
stock market crash last October. Gold is supposed to serve as a
haven from shocks in other investment markets.
   ``A combination of forces has recently ganged up on the price of
gold,'' observed Charles Eaton, an analyst at Nikko Securities
International Inc., in a recent report on the subject.
   Among them, he cites rising interest rates around the world; an
upswing for the dollar in foreign exchange; falling oil prices; and
softness in prices of some other commodities, which suggest that
inflationary pressures are not intensifying the way many people
thought they would.
   ``Gold is international money as defined by the free markets,''
Eaton said. ``When gold is strong, the dollar is weak, and when
gold is weak, the dollar is usually strong.''
   At the same time, high ``real'' interest rates _ that is,
nominal interest rates compared to the rate of inflation _ have
been a drag on the gold market.
   When real interest rates stand at generous levels, they offer
investors an attractive alternative to owning gold, which pays no
interest and in fact may carry a ``negative yield'' in the form of
carrying charges, storage fees, insurance and other costs.
   Many Wall Street analysts have watched the recent drop in gold
prices with undisguised delight.
   After all, it suggests that much-ballyhooed fears of an
overheating economy are not warranted and that the Federal Reserve
is apparently succeeding in its campaign to keep inflation at bay.
   John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. sees ``a major change
from the recent consensus holding that an inflationary surge is
inevitable.''
   That line of thinking would point to good things for both the
stock and bond markets.
   But there is a darker version of the same picture _ that ``the
weakness in gold may well be forecasting a period of deflation and
debt liquidation in the months ahead,'' as Eaton says.
   That possibility, rather than an immediate revival of inflation,
now seems to be emerging as the bullish case most often advanced by
gold advocates these days.
   ``Given the size of the worldwide debt problem and the potential
for a credit contraction, we would expect the Federal Reserve to
flood the system with liquidity (i.e., loanable funds),'' Eaton
argues.
   In such circumstances, he says, the dollar will naturally be
cheapened and ``gold will soar.''
   That fits with gold's image as a kind of financial insurance
policy. Like most other insurance policies, it is a bet that many
people, even as they make it, hope they are not going to win.

<HEAD>Takeover Fever Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The biggest action in the stock market these
days isn't the buying and selling of shares in companies but the
buying and selling of the companies themselves.
   This is takeover fever, and rather than diminishing as forecast
it seems to be intensifying. Involved in the action are corporate
raiders, corporations seeking new assets, leveraged buyout funds
and big financial institutions.
   The reheating of leveraged buyout fever was measured again last
week when Manufacturers Hanover Corp., once a staid old banking
operation, announced formation of a buyout fund that could amount
to as much as $2 billion.
   Large as that figure is, it belies the true buying power. When
used to buy out shareholders of a target company, it can be
leveraged at a ratio of from 5-to-1 to even 10-to-1, or $10 billion
to $20 billion.
   Such an amount is sufficient to frighten the management of all
but the biggest companies in the United States, but it is only a
small part of the pot. An estimated $25 billion to $30 billion is
controlled by buyout specialists.
   The activity itself _ and the potential for more _ is generating
concern not just from business and investment people, but from
other interested parties who fear that the long-term soundness of
the economy is endangered.
   High on the list of concerns is that sound companies, slowly
built over many decades, are falling into the hands of manipulators
rather than managers, and are prone not only to immediate
dissection but also to eventual destruction.
   Enhancing the power _ and perhaps the danger _ of leveraged
buyout money are ``junk bonds,'' which are high-risk debt
securities paying high rates of interest. A major role of such
bonds is to substitute long-term debt for equity.
   Debt does wonderful things for those seeking to buy existing
companies, but it is generally thought to be more dangerous than
equity to deal with. And, the critics say, those dangers may be
worsened by other activities of the buyers.
   One of these activities is to think short term _ to sacrifice
distant strength for immediate financial results _ and that, say
critics, can get any company into trouble. Such buyers also seek to
lessen debt by selling off parts of the company, perhaps weakening
it in the process.
   The debt itself can become the biggest problem of all,
especially in a downturn. Costly to begin with, it can become
destructively so in a recession or period of high interest rates,
when even strong companies may teeter.
   There is another, more positive, view of the scene: Leveraged
buyouts sometimes get rid of poor management, and they provide a
premium over market prices for shareholders of the company taken
over.
   During 1986, for example, 31 percent of all deals were completed
at a 50 percent or better premium. In 1987, 38 percent of all deals
were at prices at least 50 percent higher than those that prevailed
a month earlier.
   Such short-term benefits cannot be denied. The question only
time can answer is whether these immediate benefits provoke distant
problems.
   ``The transformation of billions of dollars of equuity into debt
is eroding the financial footing of U.S. industry,'' says Wright
Investors' Service. It worries about the economic consequences in a
downturn.
   Concern also is expressed by many critics about the market
volatility and instability that have increased as a result of
takeover fever, with some stocks rising or falling 10 percent in a
day on takeover speculation.
   It was, Wright says, one of the underlying causes of the stock
market collapse of last October, and it also seems to be high on
the list of reasons why many individual investors have abandoned
the market, perhaps for good.

<HEAD>Cars and Trucks: Good '88; Softer '89 Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The end of the 1988 model year is producing
surprisingly strong sales results for the nation's biggest
automakers but raising tough questions for the future.
   Sales results due out Tuesday are expected to show around 15.5
million vehicles _ roughly two-thirds cars and the rest light
trucks _ were sold during the model year. That would be up slightly
from last year, and down from the industry record of 16.1 million
vehicles sold in 1986.
   Up ahead _ in 1989 and beyond _ looms a softer market, analysts
said this past week.
   High on the minds of analysts and consumers are how much cars
and trucks will cost and what kind of incentives automakers will
create in the coming months to lure people into dealerships.
   ``Nobody buys cars without incentives,'' said analyst Kathleen
Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc.
   ``It's another way of life _ sort of like frequent-flier
programs in the airlines,'' said Mike Kobayashi of PaineWebber Inc.
He added that incentives would be part of marketing all kinds of
cars and trucks.
   Analysts agreed consumers are expecting to be offered cash
incentives, and there's a chance that cut-rate financing, which
dropped as low as 1.9 percent just over a year ago, may return if
fears of higher interest rates and modest inflation in 1989 later
prove true.
   But Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. said consumers
may be offered enticements earlier. ``We could come into the
calendar year with some kind of incentive,'' he said.
   Beyond that, there is some question about how domestic and
foreign car makers can convince consumers that their vehicles are
the best and the most affordable. Warranties may come into play,
leasing may be more attractive and safety could be a big concern.
   Estimates of 1989 sales by more than a dozen analysts ranged
from a high of about 15 million vehicles to a low of about 13
million.
   ``I think 1989 (sales) will be flat, but a relatively good year
for the Big Three,'' said Joshuah Harari of Standard & Poors Corp.
   For the past several years, General Motors Corp. has seen its
share of the American vehicle market slip as buyers turned to Ford
Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and the imports. The analysts expect to
see GM arrest that slide in the next model year as, among other
things, the world's largest corporation gives each of its divisions
more distinctive personalities.
   ``They've lost the equivalent of a Chrysler-size company (in
sales) in the last three to four years,'' said David Healy of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``GM stopped the hemorrhaging in terms of market share, but
there's still some blood on the Band-Aid,'' said Joseph Phillippi
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Generally, the No. 1 automaker is aiming Chevrolet at the
economy and modestly priced end of the market; Pontiac is being
tagged as the performance car division; Oldsmobile is getting the
lion's share of GM's high-tech work and Buick and Cadillac are
offering the company's top-of-the-line cars.
   Some experts doubt whether Ford can continue its phenomenal
earnings pace of the first half of the year. The nation's No. 2
automaker has set industry earnings records during the last two
quarters _ each well over $1 billion.
   ``They are awash in liquidity,'' said Beth Fusco of Moody's
Investor Services.
   ``Ford continues to roll on ... but their quality seems to be
slipping a little,'' Phillippi said. ``I've seen dirt in the paint
of cars on showroom floors.''
   Healy agreed. ``One of the things I worry about at Ford is
they've been running full (capacity) for so long ... you wonder if
they're vulnerable to some quality problems,'' he said.
   Quality and customer satisfaction are major concerns at
Chrysler, where Gerald Greenwald, chairman of the corporation's
car-making arm Chrysler Motors Corp., conceded the company would
have to struggle to hold on to its 1988 car sales levels in 1989.
Big benefits for the No. 3 automaker have been its Jeeps and
trend-setting minivans.
   ``God bless minivans and Jeeps,'' Ben Bidwell, Chrysler Motors'
marketing president said late last month during the corporation's
1989 model introduction.
   Chrysler was the most involved in last year's incentive fire
sales, and it lost money in the process. But some analysts suggest
that offering incentives was the only thing Chrysler could do at
the time, and since then, the company's market share has crept up a
bit.
   ``They bought market share (whose cost) is pretty high,'' said
Don DeScenza of Nomura Securities Inc.
   But consumers are mainly concerned about one thing _ price. And
it appears that prices are going up this coming year, generally
averaging 3 percent to 4 percent above 1988 sticker prices.
   However, said Dick Henderson of the Pershing Division of
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.,``I can't see how prices on new
vehicles are going to be higher than inflation.''
   ``It's going to be interesting to see how the customer reacts to
the pricing,'' Phillippi said.
   Beyond 1989, though, auto analysts see some dark days.
   ``The big cloud on the horizon is ... aren't we due for a
recession?'' wondered Charles Brady of Oppenheimer & Co.
   ``It's going to be bad in '90 and '91,'' Harari predicted.

<HEAD>Survey: Bankers' Confidence in World Credit at All-Time Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The confidence of international bankers in the
creditworthiness of the world's nations has sunk to a 10-year low,
Institutional Investor magazine said Friday.
   Every six months the magazine polls about 100 international
commercial banks to rank the creditworthiness of 112 nations on a
scale of 0 to 100.
   Its September survey found Japan again garnered the most
confidence, with a rating of 94.8. Switzerland was second at 93.9,
West Germany third at 93.1 and the United States fourth at 89.7.
   At the bottom of the heap were Nicaragua, with a 5.2 rating, and
North Korea, with 4.5.
   The average rating of all 112 nations, Institutional Investor
said, hit an all-time low of 38.7.
   ``The new global low is the culmination of a long-term downward
trend in the 10 years that this magazine has been compiling country
credit ratings,'' it said. ``The decline of two tenths of a point
since March 1988 ... seems to reflect an instinctive pessimism,
even a worldweariness, rather than any specific developments.''
   Average country credit ratings have been sinking at a
particularly fast clip since August 1982, when Mexico's
announcement that it could not meet its foreign debt payments
signaled the beginning of a Third World debt crisis that continues.
   Third World debtor nations now owe an estimated $1.2 trillion to
foreign banks, governments, international credit institutions and
other global creditors. The total debt continues to grow as the
debtor nations fall further behind on their payments of principal
and interest.

<HEAD>Survey: Service Sector CEOs the Highest Paid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief executive officers at service companies
are the highest paid executives in the country, according to a
survey released Sunday.
   The survey found that the median compensation _ salary plus
bonuses _ for chief executives in 24 service companies was $649,000
from 1986 to 1987. That means half earned more than $649,000 and
half got less.
   The Conference Board, a business-financed research organization,
listed computer services and software, health care and
entertainment-oriented and real estate firms among the service
companies in its survey.
   ``The position of diversified services at the top of the
compensation ladder reflects the significant growth of this
country's service economy,'' said Charles Peck, who studies
compensation for the Conference Board.
   CEOs at 254 manufacturing firms ranked second in compensation,
with a median of $642,000, and executives in 31 energy and natural
resource firms were third with a median of $525,000.
   Ranking fourth were 33 retail and wholesale trade company chief
executives, with a median of $413,000; fifth were 93 commercial
bankers, at $412,000; and sixth were 91 insurance CEOs, at $398,000.
   In seventh place, at the bottom of the list, were 111 utility
executives, whose median salary was $355,000, the Conference Board
said.
   ``The low compensation standing of utilities clearly reflects
the heavy degree of regulation in this industry,'' Peck said.
   ``Compensation in banks and insurance firms has been rising as
these industries become more deregulated and the scope and
responsibilities of the top jobs increases,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ramada Considering Options to Maintain Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc. is considering restructuring its
operations as an alternative to a friendly buyout offer made
earlier this month by the Pritzker family of Chicago, the
Phoenix-based company said Thursday.
   Among Ramada's options are selling some divisions or assets or
negotiating a management buyout, according to securities analysts.
The Pritzker family owns 7.2 percent of Ramada's stock and is the
corporation's largest shareholder.
   Ramada Chairman Richard Snell met Tuesday in Chicago with Jay
Pritzker, president of HCC Corp., an affiliate of the Hyatt hotel
chain. HCC had offered $100 a share, but Ramada's directors
rejected that Sept. 16.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday in
Washington indicated that Pritzker reaffirmed the $368 million
offer for Ramada. The filing said Snell believed there was no
substantial difference between a deal discussed Tuesday and the
rejected offer.
   Daniel Lee, vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York, said he was not surprised that Pritzker did not raise his bid.
   ``Why should he be negotiating against himself?'' Lee asked.
``Nobody else has made a higher offer.''
   Lee also said that Ramada may not get a better offer. Ramada's
stock closed Thursday at $9.62{, up 12{ cents from Wednesday, in
New York Stock Exchange trading. Early Friday afternoon, it was
trading at $9.75, up another 12{ cents from Thursday's close.

<HEAD>Gold Coin Sales Soar Following Metal's Drop Below $400</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be followed later in cycle with an ADD containing weekly
price trends</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Olympic athletes aren't the only ones going for the gold lately.
   Precious-metals dealers say sales of gold coins soared as much
as 60 percent in the past week after the yellow metal's price fell
below $400 a troy ounce.
   The jump in demand hasn't been strong enough to push gold's
price back above $400, a key psychological barrier it cracked on
Sept. 21 for the first time in more than 19 months. But many
investors, from individuals to managers of large corporate
portfolios, believe gold below $400 represents a buying opportunity
too good to ignore.
   ``Thank goodness, considering there was virtually no demand for
gold coins before gold dipped below $400,'' said Bruce Kaplan,
senior vice president of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., a large
dealer based in Santa Monica, Calif.
   ``We've seen a tremendous surge in demand for the U.S. Eagle,
the Canadian Maple Leaf and the Australian Nugget coins,'' he said.
   Kaplan said A-Mark's sales of gold, silver and platinum were up
40 percent during the seven business days ending Thursday compared
with the previous seven business days. Most of that business was in
gold, he said.
   Kaplan said buying activity didn't really take off until gold
dropped to $395 an ounce on Sept. 23. Prices inched higher for most
of the past week, then fell again on Friday.
   Gold for October delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange
settled Friday at $394.40 a troy ounce.
   Gold was valued at around $440 an ounce in early July and at
about $490 in late December.
   James Blanchard, chairman of New Orleans-based precious-metals
dealer Blanchard & Co., reported a 60 percent increase in sales
during the period Sept. 23-28 compared with the previous four
business days.
   ``A lot of people who invest in precious metals are people who
look for bargains and they figure this is the time to go,''
Blanchard said.
   New York-based Deak International Inc. reported an estimated
sales gain of 30 percent to 50 percent in September compared with
August. Spokeswoman Jerri Eskow said most of the orders were from
new customers, many of them first-time buyers.
   Gold's plunge from around $430 an ounce just one month ago was
precipitated by government reports that indicated the U.S.
economy's growth had slowed substantially after the brisk expansion
of the first half.
   Gold is seen as a investment hedge against inflation, which
typically rises in a rapidly expanding economy. The recent signs of
slower economic growth stifled demand for gold, so its price
dropped.
   Most analysts expect gold prices to bottom out somewhere between
$360 and $390 an ounce, so speculators have been buying on price
dips.
   But analysts recommended caution. Richard Levine, vice president
of the precious metals and foreign exchange group of Elders Futures
Inc., said that at current price levels, small investors interested
in gold should spend no more than 50 percent of what they are
prepared to commit to gold or gold products.
   ``I would not commit more than 50 percent because I think the
market is going to have one more major selloff,'' he said.
   ``I think I'd begin to buy on a scaled-down basis,'' said Bette
Raptopoulos, precious-metals analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``Realistically speaking, it's not that clear that it's going to
gallop up again, but I'd begin buying from here on into the
(presidential) election,'' she said. ``Then I think that toward the
end of the year, you'll begin to see a shift'' toward higher prices.
   One-ounce coins are the most popular form of gold ownership, and
the U.S. Eagle enjoys the greatest favor among buyers in this
country. Other coins include the Maple Leaf, the Nugget, the
British Brittania and the Chinese Panda.
   Buying and selling is as easy as picking up a telephone and
giving the dealer your credit card nubmer. Many banks and coin
dealers also sell gold coins.
   Dealers generally charge a 5 percent or 6 percent premium over
the spot gold price, plus an additional fee of $3 or $4 for
customers who want to take physical possession of their gold. The
other option is to have the dealer store the gold for you.
   ``A lot of people want something they can touch,'' said Diane
Meagher, manager of Deak International's Chicago office. ``We want
our customers to feel comfortable with what they're holding.''

   If a stockbroker friend of yours isn't in
especially good spirits right now, please understand. October has
arrived.
   For the average citizen, October has a lot going for it: the
World Series, colorful foliage in much of the country, Halloween.
   But as even the most casual follower of finance knows, October
has been witness to a disproportionate amount of disasters in the
stock market.
   For starters, there was the Great Crash in 1929. Back-to-back
selloffs in the late 1970s came to be known as the ``October
massacres.''
   And then, of course, there was October 1987, when stocks endured
a collapse that culminated in a record 22.6 percent drop in the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials on Black Monday, Oct. 19.
   This year, the market begins the month still bearing a lot of
scars from that rout. Trading volume, and morale, have both been
running at low levels lately on Wall Street.
   And with all the attention the first anniversary of Black Monday
is certain to get, it is almost a foregone conclusion that stocks
are going to be tough merchandise to move for the next several
weeks.
   Just why October should hold so many pitfalls for the market is
not known. Statistical studies in the past also have focused on
May, June and September as trouble spots for investors.
   To many an observer, most calendar ``tendencies'' of this type
are no more than random phenomena lacking any predictive value for
the future.
   Some market-watchers who describe themselves as ``contrarians''
suggest that the crash memories haunting Wall Street this month may
actually produce a chance to buy stocks at bargain prices.
   If you want to pick up stocks cheap, the old argument goes, you
need to buy them when nobody else wants them.
   ``The market is suffering from buying failure, not liquidation
(of stocks),'' contends Gene Jay Seagle, an analyst at Gruntal &
Co. ``It is thoroughly liquidated already.''
   Given the current degree of pessimism, says the investment
advisory service Market Logic, ``the possibility of a buying panic
that could follow an abrupt easing of the Federal Reserve's current
tight-money policy exceeds the likelihood of a replay of last
fall's plunge.''
   The ``bargain-hunters'' made their presence felt in the past
week, as the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.23 to
2,112.91, moving within hailing distance of the post-crash high of
2,158.61 it reached on July 5.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.19 to 153.57;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.72 to 387.71; and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 2.52 at 301.63.
   Volume on the Big Board remained sluggish, averaging 134.94
million shares a day against 140.23 million the week before.
   Most market optimists' views right now are based on the
assumption that the economy is losing some of the momentum it
developed in the first half of 1988, but still growing enough to
steer clear of recession.
   One problem with that view, say the skeptics, is that slower
growth may mean disappointments in corporate earnings over the next
several quarters.
   ``The flattening profit trend will be a negative influence on
equity markets,'' say economists David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy in
the current edition of their newsletter Industry Forecast.
   ``Wall Street, however, is deeply concerned with interest rates
and inflation. The growing realization that inflation will not
become virulent and the consequent expectation that interest rates
will come down will become positive influences on the stock
market.''

<HEAD>New Rule Phases Out Bearer Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new rule that could phase out municipal bearer
bonds spells good news for the industry but not necessarily for
people who have been using them to conceal income from the Internal
Revenue Service or who like their privacy.
   Under an industry rule that took effect Sept. 18, all
interchangeable securities will be registered in a person's name
when traded, rather than the traditional ``blank check'' form under
the old method.
   A bearer bond carries no owner's name on the issuer's books and
no name on the certificate. Since no record of ownership exists,
bearer bonds have been favored by investors wishing to illegally
avoid gift, estate or other taxes.
   The holder of a bearer bond can redeem it by taking the bond
coupon to a bank or brokerage for payment and remain anonymous in
the process.
   The latest rule change was prompted by Wall Street brokers who
wanted to cut costs and make processing of the bonds more
efficient, said Angela Desmond, general counsel for the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board, the industry regulatory group that
passed the new regulation.
   It stemmed from the 1983 tax reform act that banned the issuance
of new bearer bonds.
   Since all tax-free municipal bonds sold since 1983 have been
registered with ownership recorded in computerized form, dealers
reason that it would be easier and more cost-effective to deliver
all bonds in registered form.
   In addition, registered bonds carry lower risk for all parties
involved, said Bill Rybak, senior vice president of operations with
Van Kampen Merritt Inc.
   ``It's easier to track them down if they're lost or stolen,''
Rybak said. ``If you misplace a bearer bond, the next person who
has it has a negotiable instrument. It's like picking up a $5 bill
on the ground.''
   Indeed, bearer bonds figured in a big securities heist in May
1987, when three men were arrested trying to rob a billion-dollar
shipment of no-name bonds outside the Depository Trust Co.
   The new rule gives Depository Trust, keeper of most of the
municipals held in depositories, sole discretion to decide whether
to convert some $75 billion of bearer bonds to registered form,
said Barry Zucker, president of J.B. Hanauer & Co.
   Depository Trust likes the idea of being able to clear out its
cluttered vaults so the rule is likely to lead to a phasing out of
bearer bonds.
   The change gives people who desire the anonymity of bearer bonds
little choice except to hold the bonds themselves, some analysts
say.
   Most bond buyers turn their securities over to their brokers,
who in turn hold them in the Depository Trust or some other
depository.
   Because of the anonymity factor as well as supply and demand,
bearer bonds at one time commanded a premium price, analysts said.
But the 1983 reforms changed all that.
   ``We're in a registered environment now,'' Desmond said. ``If
people are paying more for bearer bonds, that will change soon
because there really isn't any intrinsic value to holding a bearer
bond.''
   However, many people prefer keeping their investments
confidential, whether to conceal income from the IRS or for other
reasons, so the new rule can be disquieting, analysts say.
   ``People feel it's a privacy factor, a matter of anonymity''
Zucker said, adding that concealing income is not the main reason
people are opposed to the rule since banks are required to make
redemption reports.
   Bearer bonds account for about one third of the muni market now,
but that is expected to shrink by 1992, when many existing issues
will pass their 10-year call dates.

<HEAD>Financial Observer-West Accused of Taking Money from Companies it
Touted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of an investment newsletter was
accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of failing to
reveal he took thousands of dollars from companies he touted, the
Los Angeles Times reported.
   The allegations were obtained in a consent decree with the SEC
in which Robert A. Dresser and his company, Financial
Observer-West, agreed to refrain from violating securities laws,
the Times reported Friday. In entering the agreement with the SEC,
Dresser didn't admit guilt.
   The SEC accused Dresser, 59, of Glendale, of accepting fees
totaling more than $100,000 from eight publicly traded companies
which were covered in his publication, Stockbroker Special
Situations Newsletter. The newsletter described itself as an
independently reported publication.
   Neither Dresser nor his firm had listed telephone numbers in
Glendale and so could not be reached for comment.
   Without identifying the companies, the SEC alleged that since
1986, eight firms paid the newsletter fees ranging from $14,000 to
$17,000 in exchange for a favorable article recommending that
readers buy the company's stock.
   The newsletter ``purported to analyze the operations, management
and potential growth of a small publicly traded company,'' the SEC
complaint said, but the articles ``contain almost exclusively
favorable comments on the growth prospects of the featured
companies.''

<HEAD>Leading Indicators and Home Sales Up, Oil Prices Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest batch of government figures suggest the economy is
growing modestly and will avoid recession through 1989, but
investors were more concerned with falling oil prices.
   The Commerce Department said Friday its chief forecasting gauge
of future economic activity rose a moderate 0.4 percent in August,
indicating to analysts that growth will continue through next year,
but at a slower pace.
   The gain in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators follows a
0.6 percent drop in July and a 1.5 percent jump in June. The index
is intended to predict economic activity six to nine months in
advance.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said new
single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
713,000 units in August, up 0.1 percent from July and unchanged
from June.
   It was the best three-month performance since February-April
1987, when long-term mortgage rates dipped below 9 percent and
spurred a housing sales boom.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the reports were
``good news for the economy'' and ``suggest continued economic
growth.''
   But those reports were largely bypassed in the financial
markets, where strategists were trading on news that oil prices had
skidded to nearly $13 a barrel in panicky trading, the lowest level
in more than two years.
   The oil decline was caused partly by speculation that Saudi
Arabia, the world's largest exporter, might flood the world with
crude and wrench prices down drastically.
   Reverberations from the oil selloff spilled into the currency
market, where the dollar fell sharply on trader fears that
declining energy prices would ease inflation pressure and thereby
depress interest rates in the United States. Gold also fell on the
prospect of lower inflation.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation and
interest rates, prices rose sharply and yields on the key 30-year
Treasury issue fell to 8.98 percent from 9.06 percent.
   But investors in the stock market reacted indecisively to the
oil decline, reflecting a wariness that has pervaded Wall Street in
the nearly one year since the Oct. 19, 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up about 18
points at its midsession high, closed with a 6.40 loss at 2,112.91.
The broader market was mixed.

<HEAD>Crude Prices Hit Two-Year Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panic trading sparked by renewed fears of an
oversupply of world oil sent crude prices to the lowest level in
more than two years, and some analysts say prices will continue
weakening.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, the contract for
November delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, closed down 55 cents at $13.37 a 42-gallon barrel after
dropping to a session low of $13.25.
   It was the lowest closing level since Aug. 4, 1986, when the
near-term contract settled at $13.29 a barrel.
   Analysts said indications that Saudi Arabia is flooding the
market with oil in an effort to discipline other members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries renewed investor
anxieties about weakening oil prices.
   Predictions from OPEC Secretary-General Subroto that prices
could hit $5 a barrel created panic selling, analysts said.
   Subroto's statements followed a report by an industry
publication that the OPEC is producing about 3 million barrels a
day over their implied ceiling of 17.5 million barrels.
   Many analysts predicted that prices will weaken further in the
near future.
   ``Prices will continue to decline,'' said James Steel, an
analyst with Refco Inc. ``But they should hold around $12 a
barrel.''
   In other trading activity Friday, wholesale unleaded gasoline
prices rose to settle at 47.89 cents a gallon, compared with
Thursday's closing price of 46.42 cents a gallon. Other contract
months declined.
   Analysts said the gains in gasoline stemmed partly from the
recent hurricane threat in the Gulf of Mexico when refineries and
oil rigs halted operations.
   Production statistics released this week showed that although
gasoline inventories were up 2.2 million barrels on a weekly basis
to 219 million barrels, they were 10 million barrels below the same
period a year earlier.
   Heating oil fell 1.50 cents to end the day at 38.04 cents.
