   Democrats, while losing the White House by
almost landslide proportions, managed to boost their majority in the
Senate by at least one vote, and possibly two, depending on the
outcome of a cliff-hanger race in Florida.
   More than 24 hours after the polls opened for Tuesday's election,
there still was no winner in the race for the Senate seat in Florida
being vacated by Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   With only a portion of an estimated 100,000 absentee ballots
still uncounted among 4 million cast, Republican Rep. Connie Mack
overtook Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay and began building a slight
lead.
   A victory by Mack would leave Democrats with 55 of the 100 Senate
seats, up one from the 54-46 majority they held during the last
Congress. Should MacKay win, Democrats would hold a 56-44 edge.
   Democrats lost seats in Montana and Mississippi; Republican seats
changed parties in Connecticut, Nebraska, Nevada and Virginia.
   Even if Democrats were to lose in Florida and Connecticut, where
a recount is possible, they still would have the majority, which
carries with it the chairmanship of every committee and the right to
set the Senate's agenda.
   Some key lawmakers indicated that does not necessarily spell
trouble for President-elect George Bush.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said he and other chairmen ``are prepared to work with
President Bush and do that straight up, no holds barred, and find
whether he means what he says when he says that he expects to have a
close relationship with the Senate and the House.''
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., predicted budget issues will dominate
the attention of the Senate and House next year. The new president's
oft-repeated opposition to higher taxes ``will be the big sticking
point'' in his dealings with Congress, Domenici added.
   Bush, who regularly reviled liberals during his campaign, will
find himself having to deal with some powerful Senate liberals who
easily won re-election.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor and Human
Resources Committee, took 66 percent of the vote in winning a fifth
six-year term. Sens. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., Banking Committee
chairman, and Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., who heads the Environment and
Public Works Committee, were re-elected with 61 percent each.
   Another prominent liberal, Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, one of
three senators vying to become majority leader in the new Congress,
won a second full term with 81 percent of the vote.
   In fact, landslides were the order of the day in the Senate
races. Twenty-two of the 33 seats up for grabs were won with at
least 57 percent of the vote.
   Charles Robb, son-in-law of former President Johnson, was elected
in Virginia, taking the seat given up by one-term Sen. Paul Trible,
a Republican. In Minnesota, a famous son, Hubert H. Humphrey III,
failed in his bid to unseat Republican David Durenberger, who has
served in the Senate since 1978.
   The most liberal Republican senator, Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut, who served 18 years, lost by 10,052 votes to Democrat
Joseph Lieberman, the state attorney general, who campaigned as a
backer of some initiatives of the Reagan administration. There had
been talk of a recount, but the final spread was not close enough to
warrant that.
   In Montana, Democratic Sen. John Melcher, first elected to
Congress in 1969, was upset by Conrad Burns, a former farm
broadcaster who accused Melcher of being too liberal. Burns becomes
the state's first GOP senator in 36 years.
   Veteran Republican Rep. Trent Lott defeated Democratic Rep. Wayne
Dowdy to win the seat being vacated by the Senate's most senior
member, Democrat John C. Stennis.
   Nevada voters retired Republican Sen. Chic Hecht after one term,
replacing him with Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan.
   In Nebraska, appointed Sen. David Karnes, a Republican, lost to
Bob Kerrey, a popular former governor and Vietnam war hero.
   While 10 new senators were elected Tuesday, there will be 11 new
faces when the Senate convenes in January. The governor of Indiana
will name a successor to Sen. Dan Quayle, who was elected vice
president.
   The other results:
   ARIZONA: Sen. Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat and one of the
wealthiest senators, won 61 percent of the vote and a third term.
   CALIFORNIA: First-term Republican Sen. Pete Wilson had an
easier-than-expected time defeating Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy.
   DELAWARE: Republican Sen. William V. Roth, co-author of the
Reagan-era tax cuts, easily won a fourth term.
   HAWAII: Democrat Spark Matsunaga rolled up 79 percent of the vote
in winning a third term.
   INDIANA: Republican Richard Lugar, a former chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, won a third term with a 68 percent
mandate.
   MARYLAND: Liberal Democrat Paul Sarbanes, first elected in 1976,
won a new term with 62 percent of the vote while his former law
school classmate, presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, was losing
this traditionally Democrtic state.
   MISSOURI: Republican John C. Danforth, who barely squeaked
through six years ago, won a third term with 68 percent of the vote.
   NEW JERSEY: Liberal Democrat Frank Lautenberg won a second term,
beating one of the Republicans' glamour candidates, Pete Dawkins, by
a 54-46 margin.
   NEW MEXICO: Democrat Jeff Bingaman was given a second term and 63
percent of the vote.
   NEW YORK: Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, an expert on social
issues, won a third term with his biggest margin, 67 percent.
   OHIO: Howard Metzenbaum, the liberal Democrat most irksome to
Republicans, piled up 57 percent in defeating Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich for a third term.
   PENNSYLVANIA: Republican John Heinz, who sometimes gets under the
skin of GOP leaders, took a 2-1 victory for a third term.
   RHODE ISLAND: Two-termer John Chafee, in line to be senior
Republican on the Environment committee, walked to an easy win.
   TENNESSEE: Democrat Jim Sasser, expected to become chairman of
the Budget Committee, approached a 2-1 victory margin in winning a
third six-year term.
   TEXAS: Lloyd Bentsen, who was swamped in the race for vice
president, had a million-vote victory in winning a fourth term.
   UTAH: Conservative Orrin Hatch, senior Republican on labor and
education matters, won 68 percent and a third term.
   VERMONT: Folksy Rep. James M. Jeffords easily won the seat being
given up by fellow Republican Robert T. Stafford.
   WASHINGTON: Republican Slade Gorton, unseated two years ago, won
a new term over liberal Democratic Rep. Mike Lowry.
   WEST VIRGINIA: Democrat Robert C. Byrd, first elected in 1958,
was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote. He is giving up the
majority leader's post to become president pro tem and
Appropriations chairman.
   WISCONSIN: Democrat Herbert Kohl spent $5 million of his own
money to spread his anti-establishment message and beat Republican
Susan Engeleiter by a 52-48 margin to succeed Democrat William
Proxmire, who is retiring.
   WYOMING: One of the most conservative Republicans, Malcolm
Wallop, won a second term by 1,300 votes, but Democrat John Vinich
is refusing to concede.

   Maryland's landmark law banning cheap handguns
won surprisingly easy approval Tuesday, a victory that gun control
forces say could reignite their movement in other states.
   With 82 percent of the precincts reporting, those favoring the
law totaled 656,598 or 58 percent, to 482,974 or 42 percent against.
   The law was winning by wide margins in urban areas to offset
heavy support for repeal in rural counties.
   The gun law battle provoked a bitter political fight that become
the most expensive in state history. The National Rifle Association
spent more $4 million to repeal the Maryland statute.

   Here is the text of the statement of
Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen from his campaign
headquarters at the Driskill Hotel:
   How wonderful to be with our friends. We're just delighted to be
home in Texas. I've about given this voice away crossing this great
country of ours, but I'm so pleased to be home with our family.
   And in the back room, in the room back there where they can't see
us _ and I know _ there they are.
   Well, this evening is still early, but it's not _ boy, my voice
is just about gone _ the last speech was at 3:00 this morning at a
rally here in Austin. I think yesterday we did four states and eight
rallies, and I don't know how many interviews, that sort of thing.
It's been an incredible experience.
   The evening is still early, but it's not too early to claim
victory in my re-election to the United States Senate. Those returns
are not complete, but they sure are conclusive. And I didn't want to
wait a minute longer to thank the people of Texas for their
wonderful and generous support and their commitment to me.
   I'd also like to make a comment about Mike Dukakis. He and I
waged a campaign that's worthy of the American people. We told you
the truth, and we stepped up to those issues. We challenged America
to do better. We fought fair, and we never quit. And we never lost
our faith in the truth. That's what you need in a campaign. I have
never seen a candidate that worked any harder, or in those last
three or four weeks delivered a message any stronger than did Mike
Dukakis in those closing days.
   And he made me proud to be his partner. He made me proud to be
his running mate and he made me proud to be an American. But right
now I want to focus on Texas, because Texas is our home. This has
been an unusual campaign. I recognize the difficulties that you had
to go through as friends of mine and supporters of mine, I think
truly unlike any campaign that's gone before. Every hazard was
there, every difficulty was twice as hard and victory is twice as
sweet in that Senate race.
   And your efforts are very important because there is still a lot
of work to do. A lot to be done for this great state of ours that's
really taken some hits. It's been through one of the toughest
decades in the history of our great state. But we all know that the
people of Texas have been through crises before, from the Alamo, to
the dust bowl, to the great depression, the boom and bust of the
energy industry, we have always solved those problems and we have
always come back, tougher than before, because the people of this
great state, they have spirit.
   They're risk takers, you bet. They are risk takers who work hard
to overcome any adversity and to build for the future. That's
Texans. Our state is rich in resources, but our richest resource,
the people that I see before me and across this great state of ours.
B.A. and I have spent most of our lives working with you, with the
wonderful people of this great state to create opportunity and
justice and prosperity for all the people of this state.
   We have a secret weapon in those battles _ the support of friends
like you. To know that we've earned your support, that you'd be here
tonight, and we have some them at two o'clock in the morning, this
morning. Can you imagine that, out there? But that's the great
reward of public service, to have that kind of support and
satisfaction from you. It made us realize how rich we are in
friends, how much you mean to us.
   So I want this last word in this campaign to be a word of thanks
to you, to all of you who have made it possible, who have given us
the strength and the kind of support to run and to win. Thank you
very much.

   Here is the text of Michael Dukakis' concession
speech Tuesday night:
   Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you all very, very
much. Kitty and I and our family can't even begin to express our
gratitude to you and to hundreds of thousands of people like you
across this country who have given so much to us and to the American
people in the last 18 months.
   Just a few minutes ago, I called Vice President Bush and
congratulated him on his victory. And I know I speak for all of you
and for all the American people when I say that he will be our
president, and we'll work with him. This nation faces major
challenges ahead, and we must work together. And I extended my best
wishes to him and to Mrs. Bush and to the members of the Bush family.
   Kitty and I also had a chance to talk to Lloyd and B.A. Bentsen _
and we _ and I know we express your feelings when I say that he and
she were superb running mates. They're wonderful friends. I'm so
proud of that choice. So proud of both of them and we have formed a
friendship which will last as long as we live on this planet. They
are two wonderful people and Lloyd Bentsen has been one of the great
assets of this campaign.
   Just 18 months ago, on what some of you will recall was a cold
and snowy April day, I asked you for your support in running what I
called a marathon for the highest honor that the American people can
bestow on anyone. I said there'd be good days, and we had a lot of
good days, didn't we? And I said there'd be not-so-good days, and we
had a few of those, too. And I talked about another marathon that I
had run in April of 1951, when I found myself struggling up a hill
or two, and people saying to me, ``Looking good Duke, go to it.''
That is what you have done, and I'm very grateful to you. We had
those good and not so good days. We reached Heartbreak Hill and
overcame it, and then we found the strength to make that final kick.
And tonight my heart is filled with gratitude that everyone who has
made this extraordinary experience of ours possible _ from my
friends and neighbors here in Massachusetts to those 3,000 people
who were waiting for us at 3 o'clock this morning in Des Moines,
Iowa.
   As I think back on this marathon I'll never forget the beauty of
this magnificent land from those beautiful colonial villages of New
Hamphsire to the farmland of Iowa to the magnificence of Yellowstone
and the California coast. But most of all I'll remember the people
I've meet, their strength, their values, their generosity, and their
hospitality to Kitty and me and to our family. And it is very
important that we continue to fight for them and for families all
across America.
   We've got to fight for that young family in Levitown on Long
Island, New York, that wants to buy a home in the community in which
they grew up and can't afford it.
   We've got to fight for that family in Sioux City, Iowa, that
can't afford health insurance to pay the bills for its young son.
We've got to fight for those high school students in Los Angeles who
are saying `no' to drugs and `yes' to their future.
   We've got to open up that door of college opportunity to every
young person in this country who is qualified to do college work.
We've got to fight to end the shame of homelessness in this country
and this great and good nation ought to be able to do that.
   We've got to fight for those unemployed steel workers in
McKeesport, Pennsylvannia, and Youngstown, Ohio, who ought to be
able to have a good job at a good wage to support themselves and
their families. And we've got fight for those families I met with in
Glen Avon, Calif., whose children today are permanently crippled
because they happened to live next door to one of the worst toxic
waste dumps in the United States of America.
   This campaign has not been just about me and Lloyd Bentsen. It's
been about these families and the challenges they face every day of
their lives. It's been about all of us and the values and the ideals
that we share. That's what we've been fighting for and that is what
we must continue to work for every day and every week and every
month of our lives.
   I'm going to continue to work for these goals with you, with my
fellow governors, with the Democratic Congress, and I'm proud to say
that we not only will continue to have a Democratic Congress but it
looks as if a strengthened Democratic Senate. We'll be working with
the new administration and above all I'll be working with the people
of Massachusetts.
   Let me say thank you to many, many people in this counrty, those
who gave us their support, those hundreds of thousand of volunteers
who worked so hard and so long and so tirelessly.
   I want to thank the members of the world's oldest and greatest
party, the Democratic Party, for all that they did. I want to thank
this wonderful family of mine, Kitty and John and Andrea and Todd
and Lisa and my mother and Kitty's dad. They've been terrific.
   And let me simply conclude by saying this to all of you and to
people like you all across the country, and especially to those of
you who are young people, and there are many young people here.
There is nothing you can do in this world more fulfilling and more
satisfying than giving of yourself to others and making a
contribution to your community and your state and your nation and
your fellow citizens.
   And one of the things that I'm proudest of in this campaign is
the thousands and thousands of young people who are involved. I
don't want you to be discouraged; I want you to be encouraged by
what you've done in this campaign. I hope many of you will go into
politics and public service. It is a noble profession, a noble
profession.
   Remember what my dad used to say to me over and over again: Much
has been given to you and much is expected of you. Much has been
given to the young people of this country, the opportunity to live
and grow up in the greatest nation on the face of this earth, and
you have a responsibility to give something back.
   Our hearts are full. We love you all. We love this country. And
we're going to continue to fight with you and with the American
people so that every citizen of this country can be a full
shareholder in the American dream. Thank you all very, very much.

<TEXT>
   The controversy over exit-polling was raised
again during Tuesday night's election coverage when the networks
once again called the presidential race before polls had closed on
the West Coast.
   The networks had a handshake agreement with Congress, which is
considering a law setting a uniform poll-closing time, that they
would not call a race in a state until that state's polls had closed.
   However, they also said if projections in states where polls had
closed indicated a candidate with the 270 electoral votes necessary
to win, they would project that candidate the winner.
   At 9:17 p.m. EST, CBS was the first network to call the election,
an hour and 43 minutes before polls closed on the West Coast. ABC
followed suit three minutes later. NBC called it at 10:30. CNN
called it at 10:42, but based on counted votes, not exit polls.
   Bruce Herschensohn, a commentator for KABC, ABC's owned station
in Los Angeles, complained about his own network's projection. ``I
understand it when the networks want to report the news,'' he said.
``But this isn't the news. They're making the news ... and then
reporting the news that they made. I think that it's terribly unfair
to the Western states.''
   The networks based the projection on exit polls, interviews with
voters after they cast ballots.
   Exit polling and network projections have been a controversy
since 1980, when NBC projected Ronald Reagan the winner at 8:15
p.m., almost three hours before polls closed on the West Coast.
Critics complain that such projections discourage voters who still
have time to vote and can affect the outcome of local races and
referendums. The networks counter that projections are news.
   Congress has considered a uniform poll closing time nationwide to
counter the effects of exit polling.
   John Tunney, another KABC commentator and former Democratic U.S.
Senator, said he was ``furious.'' ``Once again, we see the East
Coast networks treating us out here in the West as though we don't
count. We count a lot.''
   On KCBS, the CBS owned station in Los Angeles, Bob Naylor,
chairman of the California Republican Party, said on the air, ``I
think it's a real injustice to have the early projections that might
depress voter turnout in California.''
   CBS' Dan Rather stressed that it was important for voters on the
West Coast to go to the polls if they hadn't already.
   ``Let me pause and say that is our CBS News estimate ... Our
headline of the moment is that George Bush has been elected,'' he
said. ``It does make a differenece, those of you in states where
polls haven't closed, whether you vote.''
   Fifteen minutes after calling the race, ABC's Peter Jennings
offered what almost amounted to an apology on the air. ``I must
confess, I'm feeling a bit defensive,'' Jennings said to his
colleague David Brinkley.
   CBS had Bush with 277 electoral votes to Michael Dukakis' 76 and
ABC 271 for Bush and 72 for Dukakis, based on projections in states
where polls had closed. At the same time, NBC still had Bush with
only 214 electoral votes. Only a small fraction of the popular vote
had been counted. By 10:30, NBC finally called the presidential
race, estimating Bush had 279 electoral votes to Dukakis' 72.

<HEAD>Heinz Locks Up Third Senate Term in Pa., Helps Bush Win</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with Bush victory.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A landslide victory by Republican Sen. John
Heinz for a third term Tuesday helped George Bush win Pennsylvania's
prize of 25 electoral votes by a razor-thin margin.
   In an unusual twist of the coattails scenario, Heinz' popularity
as heir to his family's ketchup and pickle fortune boosted Bush's
fortunes in a state where heavy industry has declined and Democrats
hold a voter registration edge.
   With 91 percent of the precincts reporting in one of the state's
closest presidential elections ever, Bush had 1,990,346 votes, or 50
percent, while Dukakis had 1,974,795 votes, or 50 percent.
   In the Senate race, Heinz had 2,376,281 votes, or 66 percent, and
Vignola had 1,238,261 votes, or 34 percent.
   Heinz, 50, raised $5 million for his re-election, 10 times the
amount spent by Vignola, 39, a former Philadelphia city controller.
   Bush's attack on Democrat Michael Dukakis' positions on gun
control and abortion appeared to have helped the vice president in
conservative central Pennsylvania, as well as in the traditionally
Democratic northeastern region.
   Dukakis won key sections of northeastern and southwestern
Pennsylvania, but did not do as well in Philadelphia as Walter
Mondale did four years ago. Philadelphia's black community needed an
enthusiastic turnout to help push Dukakis over the top statewide.
   In the congressional races, all 23 incumbents were re-elected,
keeping the Democratic edge at 12-11.

   Michael Dukakis, his long race for the presidency
ending in disapointment, offered George Bush his congratulations
Tuesday night and told supporters he will continue to fight for
``the values and the ideals we share.''
   ``This campaign has not been just about me and Lloyd Bentsen,''
Dukakis told a crowd of 3,000 supporters who gathered for what they
had hoped would be a victory celebration at Boston's World Trade
Center.
   ``It's been about all of us, the values and the ideals that we
share. That's what weve been fighting for and that's what we must
continue to work for every day,'' he said.
   Dukakis, standing with his wife Kitty and family members, said he
had telephoned Bush ``to congratulate him on his victory,'' bringing
a chorus of boos from the crowd.
   ``I know I speak for all of you and all of the American people
when I say he will be our president and we will work with him,'' he
said. This nation faces major challenges and we must work together.''
   Dukakis spent the day at home, not sleeping despite a 48-hour
sleepless campaign finale criss-crossing America. He took an
afternoon walk and raked leaves in his back yard.
   But with aides saying his race was tight, he spent an hour and a
half in the late afternoon doing interviews with television stations
in selected states, by satellite from a Boston TV studio.
   Dukakis spent the evening at his Brookline duplex, watching the
returns on three television sets tuned to each of the networks.
   Top aide Kirk O'Donnell, asked what the mood was among Dukakis
and his family as he emerged from the home, said ``very upbeat,
considering.''
   He traveled by motorcade to the trade center, where comedian
Robert Klein had warmed up the crowd and a laser light show
accompanied Dukakis' campaign theme song, Neil Diamond's ``Coming to
America.'' In laser art, the words ``We Love the Duke'' and ``Thank
You America'' appeared on a screen.
   After speaking, Dukakis went into a private meeting with staff
and major contributors before heading home to his Perry Street
duplex.
   His supporters cheered ``92, 92,'' in reference to another quest
for the presidency in four years. But Dukakis made no reference to a
repeat of his candidacy. And his mother, Euterpe Dukakis, had a
quick answer when asked if she wanted him to run again: ``No.''
   Arriving in Boston Tuesday morning, the Democratic presidential
nominee and his family went first to their polling place before
heading home for the first chance to sleep in bed since Saturday
night.
   ``I voted for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen and I'm proud of
it,'' Dukakis said as he left the polling booth in a Brookline
housing project with his wife, Kitty, and their three children. His
mother, Euterpe Dukakis, raised her hand in a V for victory sign.
   Dukakis ended his campaign with a pair of huge rallies in
California on Monday and a through-the-night flight eastward. He
stopped in Des Moines, Iowa, for a 3:30 a.m. rally, where as many as
3,000 people showed up to see him speak on an airport tarmac. He
stopped again in Detroit for a dawn rally in the rain before flying
home.
   ``I think tonight we're not only going to surprise a few people,
but we're going to be doing the celebrating,'' Dukakis told several
hundred cheering supporters that greeted him at the airport in
Boston. ``It's been an incredible experience.
   ``Let's go out and make sure that tonight we're popping those
champagne corks,'' he said in Detroit.
   John Sasso, a top campaign official, said Dukakis had been at his
best in the final weeks and had presented America with an image of
``a fighter. ... That's why we feel so good about the last three
weeks.''
   ``Enough talk about polls,'' Sasso said. ``It's in the hands of
the American people.''
   Dukakis struck sentimental notes at his final stops, telling the
crowds he loved them and reflecting on his long campaign.
   On board his chartered campaign jet, the one nicknamed ``Sky
Pig'' for its lack of speed and range, Dukakis strolled back and
spoke with reporters, telling them he had enjoyed knowing and
working with them.
   ``You all look like the walking wounded,'' he said with a smile
to the reporters who had been with him along 8,500 miles of travel
in the final 48 hours. Though he had to be tired, he insisted, ``I
feel great.''
   Dukakis spent both Sunday and Monday nights criss-crossing the
continent in furious final campaigning.
   Asked what he had learned about himself in the long campaign,
Dukakis said, ``I'll tell you in about a week.''

<HEAD>Jackson Urges Democrats To Find Common Ground With Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with additional quotes, background; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson said Tuesday it is too early to
start talking about the 1992 election and that Democrats should be
looking for ``some common ground'' with Republican George Bush.
   Asked in an interview on ABC-TV whether he would start
campaigning immediately for the next presidential race, Jackson said
at a Democratic election-night gathering, ``It's much too early,
premature and downright immature, to be talking about 1992 politics
on this night.''
   Jackson is a veteran of two unsuccessful bids for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Jackson said in an interview published in
Sunday's Chicago Sun-Times, ``If Michael Dukakis loses on Tuesday,
the next political season will begin on Wednesday.''
   With Bush poised to win the White House, Jackson _ hoarse and
visibly tired after a long day of campaign rallies in four states _
sounded conciliatory toward the vice president.
   ``At the top of the ticket, it is not looking good, but certainly
Mike Dukakis has run a gallant race with integrity,'' said Jackson,
who returned to his Chicago base to await election returns.
   With a Bush victory, he said, ``all of us will reach out for some
common ground agenda.''
   Recalling Bush's pledge at the Republican National Convention for
a ``kinder, gentler nation,'' Jackson said, ``I hope people will get
the campaign behind us and look at that kinder, gentler agenda as it
relates to health care and day care and workers and family farmers.''
   But he said the vote did not mean Americans were rejecting the
Democratic platform.
   ``(The vote) certainly can't be against the message,'' Jackson
said. ``Michael Dukakis ... certainly had the right message. I
believe that the Dukakis-Bentsen priorities were good for America.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Keeps Nuke Plants, ``Prevailing Wages''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters on Tuesday decided to keep Massachusetts'
two nuclear plants in operation, upheld a ``prevailing wage'' law
and rejected a measure aimed at protecting farm animals from cruelty.
   With 854 of 2,140 precincts reporting, or 40 percent, the measure
to shut the Yankee Rowe and Pilgrim plants failed by 605,125 votes,
or 69 percent, to 270,617 votes, or 31 percent.
   The utility-backed campaign spent more than $8 million to sway
voters.
   Anti-nuclear groups said the plants, located respectively in
western Massachusetts and in Plymouth, endanger surrounding
communities. By closing them, the production of radioactive waste
would be curbed.
   With 40 percent of the precincts reporting returns on the
prevailing wage law, unofficial returns showed the statute being
upheld by 563,336 votes, or 60 percent, to 382,904 votes, or 40
percent.
   The construction industry was a main backer of the attempt to
repeal the law, which requires non-union workers on all public works
projects be paid the same wages as occur under existing collective
bargaining agreements.
   Also with the 40 percent reporting, the measure that asked voters
to enact regulations for more humane treatment of farm animals lost
by 658,633 votes or 71 percent, to 268,231 votes or 29 percent.
   Massachusetts farmers insisted that the new regulations would
impose an overwhelming financial burden on them.

   One fifth of Japanese companies with capital of more
than $80,000 evaded corporate taxes during the year that ended in
June, the National Tax Administration Agency reported.
   Nearly 5,000 of the country's 25,000 ``large companies'' did not
declare income totaling $3.67 billion that they earned during the
period, the agency reported Tuesday. The amount, the worst in
history, was up $180 million or 5.1 percent from last year.
   The agency said that when it rechecked more than 5,000 companies
on suspicion of tax evasion, it found that 97 percent had evaded
corporate taxes.
   The total amount of declared corporate income for the 25,000
firms was $22.3 billion, the agency reported. It said the firms paid
a total of $8.3 billion in corporate income taxes.

   A triumphant George Bush hailed his presidential
victory and vowed to work to heal wounds opened by a harsh, negative
campaign, saying an election clears ``the way for harmony and
peace.''
   ``I know that we'll come together, as we always have,'' the
president-elect told several thousand cheering supporters at a
victory party where he also pledged to ``reach out and work
constructively'' with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   ``A campaign is a disagreement and disagreements divide, but an
election is a decision, and decisions clear the way for harmony and
peace,'' Bush said.
   ``I mean to be a president of all the people,'' he said. And to
those who did not vote for him, Bush said: ``My hand is out to you.
And I want to be your president too.''
   Bush added: ``Thank you, New Hampshire,'' referring to his
comeback Republican primary victory last winter that put him on the
path to becoming the first sitting vice president to win the
presidency in more than 150 years.
   Bush, surrounded by nearly two dozen family members, told
campaign workers who filled a convention center that he had received
a call from defeated rival Michael Dukakis.
   ``I want you to know he was most gracious. His call was personal.
He was genuinely friendly and in the great tradition of American
politics,'' he said.
   Bush also received calls from President Reagan, GOP vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle, Democratic vice presidential
candidate Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat Jesse Jackson and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.
   The new president-elect voiced special praise for the man he will
succeed, Reagan, for ``turning our country around and being my
friend, and for going the extra miles on the hustings.''
   ``He is certainly one of the most decent men I have ever met.''
   Repeating a favorite campaign theme, Bush told his audience:
``When I said I want a kinder and gentler nation, I meant it and I
mean it.''
   ``This is a moving night for all of us,'' Bush said. ``And you
can't help but be moved when your country endorses your hopes and
your candidacy, and the feelings are so personal that the decision
is larger than that.''
   On Dukakis, Bush said, ``I think I know how Governor Dukakis
feels. I lost a few along the way myself and it hurts.''
   Asked by reporters when he would begin making decisions on a Bush
administration, the vice president said, ``Tomorrow.''
   Earlier, as he cast his ballot at a hotel set up as a precinct
polling place, Bush shied away from predicting victory because ``it
brings you bad luck.'' The Republican presidential nominee cites
another Houston hotel as his legal voting residence.
   Arriving with his wife shortly after the polls opened at 7 a.m.,
Bush gave a thumbs-up sign to reporters.
   ``I feel as if I wish there was a decision,'' he said. ``It's a
nervous stage, so we'll just have to wait and see.''
   He spent most of the rest of the day with family and friends at
the Houstonian Hotel, where the Bushes lease a suite, and he went
for a morning jog in a nearby park.
   Bush was to appear at a rally late Tuesday in Houston's
convention center. On Wednesday morning, he was to conduct a news
conference in Houston, then fly back to Washington for a
welcome-home rally.
   Despite Bush's reluctance to predict a win, campaign officials
were clearly joyous. ``It looks good,'' said press secretary Sheila
Tate.
   At the polling place, the Bushes punched out paper ballots and
handed them to election officials. As the vice president chatted,
his wife urged ``let's move on'' because others were waiting to vote.
   Outside, several dozen demonstrators held protest signs,
including one that said, ``Hunger isn't kind or gentle.''
   Bush also went to the local Republican headquarters, where he
spoke to volunteers and made a few get-out-the-vote calls.
   ``Wonderful.'' he said into the phone during one call. ``Now I
know I'll get at least three votes, because Bar and I already
voted.''
   Speaking with reporters, he said, ``I saw some of the very same
people with whom I started in politics 24, 25 years ago _ people on
the telephone, volunteers getting out the vote, putting up signs,
very inspirational.''
   Bush said the GOP volunteers were very optimistic about his
chances, although he added: ``But you expect your strong supporters
to feel that way.''
   When Bush left the polling place, a French-speaking television
reporter shouted questions at him.
   ``Je peux parler un peu de Francais,'' (I speak a little French),
Bush replied.
   ``Tres heureux aujourd'hui,'' (very happy today), he added.
   But when Mrs. Bush was asked in French how she felt, she
responded in Spanish: ``muy bien,'' (very good.)
   ``Au revoir,'' Bush shouted to dozens of waiting news media
representatives as he climbed into his limousine.

<HEAD>Ban on State-Paid Abortions Approved in Michigan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan voters on Tuesday called a halt to
state-funding of abortions for poor women by overwhelmingly
approving a hotly contested referendum.
   With 11 percent of the state's 6,887 precincts reporting,
unofficial results showed 219,162 voters, or 63 percent, in favor,
and 127,688, or 37 percent, opposed to the ban.
   Barbara Listing, chairwoman of the Committee to End Tax-Funded
Abortions, said the victory was a rejection of ``a policy that kills
unborn children.''
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority,
termed the defeat for pro-choice forces ``tragic.''
   ``Down where it counts, it means poor women will be injured,''
said Ms. Smeal, a former president of the National Organization for
Women.
   Passage of the measure ends the state's expenditure of $5.8
million a year for about 18,600 Medicaid abortions and makes
Michigan the 37th state to ban state payments for the procedure.
   Anti-abortion and pro-choice forces waged a $3.8 million battle
over the abortion measure.

<HEAD>Roseanne Barr's New ABC Show Moves to Second Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' is becoming television's
favorite whine as Roseanne Barr's new comedy placed second in the
Nielsen ratings for the week ended Nov. 6.
   Barr's show of working class parents has been a hit since its
premiere show came in behind NBC's World Series coverage and ``The
Cosby Show.'' Now, only Cosby separates Barr from the top.
   NBC kept its grip on first place, but all of its new shows except
``Empty Nest'' fell out of the Top 10. The critically acclaimed
comedy ``Dear John'' was 16th for the week.
   NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' now a series after a number of
specials, was 32nd. NBC's new drama series ``Tattingers'' plummeted
to 54th after placing 26th the week earlier. Another new show,
``Baby Boom,'' was 48th.
   NBC had an average rating of 14.6 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey.
ABC was second with 13.0 and CBS was third with 12.7. A ratings
point represents 904,000 homes with television. The share is a
percentage of the sets in use.
   An early lead in the November sweeps also went to NBC.
   In five days counted by Arbitron the ratings were NBC 14.5, CBS
13.2 and ABC 12.0. In four days counted by Nielsen the ratings were
NBC 15.1; CBS 13.7 and ABC 11.3. For the season to date, NBC leads
with a rating of 16.7. ABC is second with 13.1 and CBS is third with
12.1.
   The last two episodes of NBC's political thriller ``Favorite
Son'' made the Top 20. The second part tied for 19th place with CBS'
``Knots Landing'' and the third part was 16th. The first part of
another NBC miniseries, ``The Great Escape II: The Untold Story,''
was 27th.
   The first chapter of CBS' ``Internal Affairs,'' a police mystery
in which Richard Crenna reprised world-weary detective Frank Janek
from an earlier miniseries, ``Doubletake,'' was 17th. The second
part of the CBS miniseries ``Dadah Is Death'' was 52nd.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC`s ``The Cosby Show;'' ABC's
``Roseanne;'' NBC's ``A Different World'' and CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
tied; NBC's ``The Golden Girls;'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss;'' NBC's
``Cheers;'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote;'' NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and
ABC's ``Growing Pains.''
   ABC's ``Head of the Class'' took 13th place with a one-hour
expanded episode in Moscow.
   Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore are back on CBS with new
shows, but it may be for only short visits.
   ``The Van Dyke Show'' was in a three-way tie for 61st place and
Moore's ``Annie McGuire'' was 64th.
   CBS had the lead among the evening news shows. The ratings: CBS
11.7, ABC 10.9, NBC 10.2.
   The lowest-ranked show in 70th place was NBC's ``Decision '88.''
The bottom shows were: ABC's ``88 Vote,'' CBS's ``West 57th
Street,'' CBS' ``Raising Miranda,'' CBS' ``Simon & Simon'' and NBC's
``Decision '88.''

   With 79 percent of the precints reporting, the bond issue
proposal led by 1,704,659 votes, or 54 percent, to 1,477,287 votes,
or 46 percent. As expected, the bond issue passed because of strong
support in New York City and its suburbs.
   The proposal was strongly backed by Gov. Mario Cuomo and leaders
of the Legislature as the best way to finance road and bridge
repairs. Interest on the borrowing was calculated at $2.1 billion
during the next 30 years.
   The proposal came five years after New Yorkers agreed to Cuomo's
request to borrow $1.25 billion for transportation projects.
   With the money from that bond issue due to run out in March, New
York still has 1,600 miles of highway considered in poor condition
by its inspectors, 660 miles of roads that aren't big enough to
handle their traffic and 7,400 bridges rated unacceptable.
   Cuomo had argued that borrowing was the only way to pay for
repairing highways without raising taxes and avoiding another
tragedy like the collapse of a state Thruway bridge last year in
which 10 people died.

   Here is the text of the victory speech delivered
Tuesday night by Vice President George Bush:
   I have just received a telephone call from Governor Dukakis. And
I want you to know that he was most gracious. His call was personal,
it was genuinely friendly and it was in the great tradition of
American politics.
   And we can now speak the most majestic words a democracy has to
offer: The people have spoken. And with a full heart and with great
hopes, I thank all of the people throughout America who have given
us this great victory.
   And I thank Ronald Reagan. I thank him for turning our country
around and for being my friend and for going the extra mile on the
hustings. It was just like him. He is simply one of the most decent
men I have ever met.
   I want to thank my friend, my running mate Dan Quayle and his
family. And they have shown great strength under fire, campaigned
incessantly, and I am proud of him and proud of his family.
   I want to thank my great friend, Houston's son, Jim Baker, and
our campaign chairman, Lee Atwater, and the men and women of the
campaign, the national staff, the RNC (Republican National
Committee), all of our state chairmen and chairwomen, and all of the
organizations and the political clubs, and I especically thank the
young people who were always up at night putting up the signs, the
people at those telephone banks and the ones who canvassed door to
door.
   And there's a large gathering of volunteers right now at the
Washington Hilton and, folks, my heart is with you and many, many
thanks for all you've done from our nation's capital.
   And I want to talk to you about my family. Fact is, I'd be
nothing without them, our four sons, our daughter Doro, and my own
Barbara Bush and I guess _ I guess I shouldn't say she's my own
anymore, for soon she'll be the first lady of all the United States.
   And I _ I thank God for the faith he's given me, and as I grow
older, as I grow older, I'm more aware of the spiritual element in
life and I ask for God's help.
   And I thank _ and I thank, the men and women of Texas, there are
people, people right here I recognize and started out with me in
politics with me in 1962, and you never lost faith, you never left
me and you're a source of my strength.
   And this is a moving night for all of us, and you can't help but
be moved, when your country endorses your hopes, and your candidacy,
and the feelings are so personal. But the decision is larger than
that, and now we will move again, for an America that is strong, and
resolute in the world, strong and big-hearted at home. And when I
said _ when I said I want a kinder, gentler nation, I meant it. And
I mean it.
   A campaign _ a campaign is a disagreement, and disagreements
divide, but an election is a decision, and decisions clear the way
for harmony and peace, and I mean to be a president of all the
people, and I want to work for the hopes and interests, not only of
my supporters, but of the governor's and of those who didn't vote at
all. To those who supported me, I will try to be worthy of your
trust, and to those that did not, I will try to earn it. And my hand
is out to you, and I want to be your president too.
   But I, I think I know how Governor Dukakis feels _ lost a few
along the way myself, and it hurts. But we both went into the arena
and we fought long and hard. The governor can take great
satisfaction in the fact that his valiant family _ Kitty and Kara
and Andrea and John _ did him proud. And now, and now I know that
we'll come together as we always have, 200 years of harmony in the
oldest, greatest democracy in man's time on earth.
   And I _ and I've traveled many miles and reached for many hands.
And it's occured to me that what we were having, the people of
America and I, was a conversation, a back and forth, a mutual
dialogue, and it cannot go away. Not now, not when I need it most.
And so I mean to keep the conversation going, to keep walking
towards you, talking with you, and reaching for the hands. And
another thing, I'll do my level best, to reach out and work
constructively with the United States Congress.
   And a final word _ and a final word about what you mean to me, my
friends in this room, every time Barbara and I come to Texas, it's a
homecoming. We were young here, started out here 40 years ago,
summer of '48, worked in the oil fields, and you know, started a
business, and went into politics. Forty years. Forty years of work
and caring and friendship and now I'm going to take that love and
friendship.
   It's all right here in this room, put it in my pocket, take it
with me to Washington, D.C., where it's sometimes cold, but always
gracious, and where God knows there's lots of work to do. So thank
you, God bless you. And one other thing, once in days that were a
little darker, I made a promise, and now I'll keep it.
   Thank you New Hampshire, thanks for everything, and God Bless
America.
   Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you all.

with four 600-horsepower diesel engines.
   Johnson finished second in the superboat class. He drove a

   Soul singer James Brown pleaded innocent to
traffic and weapons charges.
   Brown's lawyer, Albert H. ``Buddy'' Dallas, entered the pleas
Tuesday for his client, who is on tour in Europe, and asked for a
jury trial.
   Brown's trial probably will begin in January. The singer is
scheduled to return to the United States later this month.
   The charges against Brown, a resident of nearby Beech Island,
S.C., stem from a Sept. 24 incident that began in the Augusta
building housing his office.
   According to police, Brown entered an insurance seminar in the
building, armed with a shotgun and a pistol, demanding to know who
gave participants permission to use restrooms in his office. He
proceeded to lead Georgia and South Carolina authorities on a
two-state chase, police said.
   In Georgia, Brown faces charges of reckless driving, having no
state tag, driving with a suspended license, fleeing or attemption
to elude police officers, carrying a pistol without a license,
carrying a deadly weapon to a public gathering and simple assault.
All are misdemeanors.
   South Carolina charges include two counts of assault and battery
with intent to kill, failing to stop for patrol car sirens and
revolving lights, and driving under the influence.

   Boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, upbeat after his
knockout victory over Donny Lalonde, says he's not about to retire.
   The triumph for Leonard, who was knocked down in the fourth
round, made him the World Boxing Council super middleweight and
light heavyweight champion and the first man to win at least pieces
of titles in five weight classes.
   ``A guy who doesn't have it any more couldn't have beaten Donny
Lalonde,'' Leonard said Tuesday.
   The 32-year-old fighter, who has announced his retirements three
times before, said he will take some time to reflect on his win.
   ``Right now I just want go home and relax and watch the tape of
the fight and evaluate myself,'' Leonard said.

   Golfing great Jack Nicklaus says he's
unable to play with a degenerative back condition, and will seek
further medical advice before deciding his future.
   A doctor's examination Monday confirmed a disc problem in
Nicklaus' lower back.
   ``The next step is to get opinions from other specialists in
several different fields on whether surgical procedures are
advisable at this time,'' the 48-year-old golfer said, adding that
he will be examined by three specialists.
   At best, he said, ``I'll be able to play like Jack Nicklaus used
to play.''
   At worst? ``I'm done. My body just won't let me practice enough
to be competitive,'' said Nicklaus, who has won a record six
Masters, five PGAs, four U.S. Opens and three British Opens, as well
as 71 American PGA Tour titles.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle pledged in
triumph Tuesday night to serve the nation with ``devotion and
dedication'' under George Bush and proclaimed the Republican Party's
victory an endorsement of the changes President Reagan has brought
to America.
   Standing under the glare of lights in a hotel ballroom packed
with some 4,000 well-wishers, Quayle also promised, ``I won't rest
ever in my determination to serve our next president, George Bush.''
   ``You have truly made this the most memorable night of our
lives,'' said Quayle, who got off to an uneven start as the No. 2
man on the ticket. As he left the hotel, he said he felt ``great.''
   Quayle, 41, was accompanied on the stage by his wife, Marilyn,
and their three children, Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 9.
   ``You did it, we did it and George Bush did it,'' he said.
   Quayle said he would give Bush all the help he could to help him
``have the constant and personal strength to lead America into the
1990s.''
   ``You need never question the devotion and dedication I will
bring to this job,'' he said.
   The crowd had waited for several hours for Quayle to make his
appearance, which did not come until after midnight. But the
enthusiasm wasn't diminished as men, women and children waved flags,
snapped pictures and cheered vigorously as he delivered his victory
speech.
   Quayle awaited a televised statement by Bush from Houston before
before entering the hotel ballroom in Washington.
   ``It is our task to fall behind George Bush, to give him the
fullest measure of our assistance and commitment as he receives the
mantle of the most powerful position on earth,'' Quayle said in a
statement which he later delivered to the ballroom crowd.
   ``I know that my obligation to our Consitution and to our people
is sacred. The vice presidency is not a job. It is a trust created
by each of you. I will never violate that trust.''
   Quayle had been a controversial choice because of his youth,
military record and other reasons. However, questioning of voters
leaving polls on Tuesday showed no overwhelming impact on the
presidential voting.
   According to NBC-Wall Street Journal exit polling, 21 percent of
voters said they had reservations about Quayle but voted GOP anyway;
16 percent said they might have voted for Bush but Quayle's presence
on the ticket helped them decide to vote for Dukakis.
   However, NBC poll analyst Sheldon Gawiser said almost all the 16
percent were Democrats, leading him to conclude Quayle actually had
little effect.
   Some 63 percent said Quayle's selection did not affect their vote
for president.
   Tuesday night, Quayle entertained about 50 supporters and friends
from Indiana, and his parents, James and Corinne Quayle, were at his
side, along with the three Quayle children, aides said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Quayle cast his ballot, took a walking tour in
his hometown and visited his 97-year-old grandmother.
   ``I'm not voting against someone. I'm voting for George Bush,''
the GOP vice presidential nominee said after emerging from the
polling place at the Huntington County Courthouse in Indiana.
   ``Well, we got one sure vote,'' Quayle said when asked whether he
voted for himself. ``Two,'' added his wife, Marilyn, who accompanied
him to the polls.
   Quayle began his day by going to his hometown dentist to get his
teeth cleaned. He said he had done that on election days in the past
and thought it was a good luck charm.
   After casting his vote, he walked through a part of the downtown,
surrounded by cheering townspeople.
   Before flying east to await the election results at a Washington
hotel, he visited his grandmother, Martha Pulliam, at a nursing home
in Franklin, Ind.
   ``She said to keep going in the right direction, but don't do
anything you shouldn't do,'' Quayle said when asked what advice she
had given him.
   During his October debate with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle had
cited his grandmother as someone who had been an inspiration to him
in his early life.

   Voter turnout this year appears to have been at
least as low as turnout in the 1948 presidential election when
slightly more than 51 percent of eligible voters went to the polls,
according to preliminary figures.
   Curtis Gans of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate said voter turnout could be as low as it was for the 1924
election, which he pegs at around 48 percent to 49 percent.
   He predicted early Wednesday that voter turnout would be
somewhere between the figures for 1948 and 1924, ``and we may just
barely escape being below 50 percent.''
   Gans said his preliminary prediction was based on analysis of 16
states that by early Wednesday had 90 percent or more precincts
reporting. Of those 16 states, all were showing declines in voter
turnout from the previous election, ``and some of them quite sharp.''
   Gans said several factors account for the low turnout.
   ``We had a horrible election in a variety of ways ... and the
people responded accordingly,'' he said. ``There are a combination
of factors, like people feeling their vote doesn't make a
difference, a declining allegiance to (political) parties, and the
conduct and coverage of the campaign.''
   The Committe for the Study of the American Electorate is a
nonpartisan, nonprofit, tax-exempt research and public policy
organization looking into voter turnout.

   Here is the text of the victory speech
delivered Tuesday night by Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle:
   Thank you very much, and the only thing I can say is that you did
it, we did it and George Bush did it.
   Thank you very much. You have truly made this the most memorable
night in our lives, and believe me, Marilyn, Tucker, Benjamin and
Corinne and I, we will never forget this night. We won't forget what
you did for me and what you have done for George Bush.
   For nearly three months since our convention in August, we have
witnessed first-hand the dedication and professionalism of literally
thousands of supporters, volunteers and staff members everywhere,
through 38 states and for more than 235 separate appearances. So
tonight, a salute to all who we never had a chance to meet or to say
hello, Marilyn and I thank you so much for all you have done.
   And let me say a special thanks to a great wife, a great mother
and a great campaigner _ Marilyn Quayle.
   A special thanks to my Senate staff, my campaign staff, and to
all those back at headquarters who committed all their energies and
devotion to the cause of this campaign. And before I say anything
else, I think we in Washington ought to let them hear us in Houston,
Texas.
   To George and Barbara Bush and their family we say
congratulations. Mr. Vice President, or better yet, I like the sound
of Mr. President-elect, from all of us _ from all of us in
Washington, and on behalf of Republicans, Democrats, and
independents across the country who helped you, we wish to salute
you for the vigor, forcefulness and fairness with which you've
conducted your campaign.
   And now all of us have another task. It is ours to fall behind
George Bush as president _ to give him the fullest measure of our
assistance and commitment as he assumes the mantle of the most
important position on this earth. And we will give him along with
our commitment our prayer that _ that he will have the constant
personal strength to lead America into the 1990's.
   And let me add _ there is no doubt in my mind that George Bush
will lead America to new greatness, preserve the security of our
blessed land, and build for each of our citizens a life of hope and
opportunity. My friends, I pledge all of us to help him in that task.
   Then, none of us can forget someone very important. And I hope he
is listening right this moment, because we did win one for the
Gipper. President Reagan enlisted me and millions like me in the
ranks of the revolution he created. We were foot soldiers for the
crusade he began and in which he brought George Bush to his side.
   Mr. President, America is greater, better, and more secure
because of what you and George Bush did.
   It is more than we, Republicans, who raise this to you. But it is
all of us, an entire nation who expressed deep gratitude for what
you and our first lady, Nancy, have given to America.
   And now, finally, I want to thank all of you out there _ the
citizens of this beautiful country _ for this opportunity. I want
you to know that while I serve as vice president of the United
States, you need never question the devotion and dedication I will
bring to this job.
   I not only will bring you two committed hands to take up the
toll, but all of my heart.
   There has never _ there has never been a nation like ours in the
history of civilization. Our people are unlike any who have joined
together. I know that my obligations to America, to our
Constitution, and to our people are sacred.
   The vice presidency is not a job, it is a trust created by each
of you. I will never violate that trust.
   And more, I won't rest ever in my determination to support our
new president, help him in the cause of our nation, and be your
devoted public servant. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
   God bless you, and God bless America.

   A proposed smoking ban that would have
given Oregon the nation's toughest anti-smoking law was rejected by
voters Tuesday.
   With 36 percent of the ballots counted, the measure was rejected
by 210,907 votes, or 61 percent, to 135,862, or 39 percent.
   Although many jurisdictions have passed anti-smoking laws,
Oregon's proposal would have been the strictest in the nation
because it would have wiped out designated smoking areas and imposed
an outright ban on smoking in virtually all indoor work areas and
enclosed places frequented by the public. Violators would have faced
a $250 fine.
   ``I don't think it was just an issue of smoking; I think it came
down to an issue of fairness,'' said Mark Nelson, who headed the
opposition.
   Proponents blamed their loss on an advertising blitz financed by
more than $2 million in contributions, largely from tobacco
companies.
   ``Frankly, a contract was let on Oregon and a hit was made,''
said Bob Neely, chairman of Cleaner Indoor Air for Oregonians. ``The
tobacco industry bought an election.''
   Nelson called that ``hogwash.''
   ``We had a difficult job of educating the public on what this
measure did,'' Nelson said. ``That took money.''
   Neely said the anti-smoking campaign would be carried to the
Legislature.
   ``The bill is already drafted and in Salem,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Former Chief Justice Warren Burger defended
prison furloughs but waited to speak out on the issue until just
hours before the election of fellow Republican George Bush, who had
campaigned for months against a furlough program in his opponent's
home state.
   Burger, in a statement released to The Associated Press on
Tuesday, contended that the furlough issue had become ``very much
garbled'' during the presidential campaign.
   The campaign left a ``general impression that furloughs are
bad,'' the former chief justice, who now chairs the Commission on
the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, said in a
telephone interview. He said he doesn't believe that either Bush or
defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis actually opposes prison furloughs.
   ``Unfortunately, the issue of corrections is never likely to
become adequately treated in any political campaign,'' Burger wrote.
   His statement was issued late Tuesday afternoon, just hours
before polls closed on the East Coast.
   ``I don't want to get into anything relating to the campaign
itself,'' said Burger, who was appointed chief justice in 1969 by
then-President Nixon and retired in 1986 to head the bicentennial
commission.
   Burger declined to say whether he approved of Bush's campaign
tactic of attacking Massachusetts' prison furlough program and
repeatedly citing the escape of furloughed inmate Willie Horton, who
later raped a woman and attacked her fiance.
   However, the former chief justice said, ``Before this campaign
ever started, there was some public confusion about the idea of
furloughs, and now there may be more.''
   Burger's statement said ``the system of `prison furloughs' is
useful and should be continued.''
   ``The issue raised in the campaign was not whether furloughs are
basically a good idea and a useful tool in the field of corrections
but whether it was administered properly,'' he said.
   In the interview, Burger said: ``There really wasn't any debate
on corrections here (during the campaign). There was the single
episode that was referred to.''
   ``I don't think either of these men (Bush or Dukakis) would
disagree'' that prison furlough programs are a good idea, he said.
   In the statement, Burger wrote: ``Any prison furlough system must
be administered with great care when it is applied to persons found
guilty of serious crimes of violence or when it is sought to be
applied to a serious repeat offender.''
   Burger said the United States should move away from ``prison
warehouses'' and instead build ``factories with fences'' in which
inmates learn a marketable skill so they can earn a living after
release.
   ``So long as we continue to casually allow so many prisons to be
simply warehouses, we can anticipate that many of the inmates will
be worse when they leave than when they entered,'' he said.
   In Scandinavian prisons, ``everybody works and everybody gets
paid,'' said Burger, who was part of a team that studied prisons in
those countries about five years ago.
   ``There they have weekend furloughs consistently,'' he said in
the interview. ``They are administered very, very carefully. If they
don't come back by Monday morning at 7 o'clock, they get a penalty
that is almost as bad as the original crime. As a result, they come
back.''
   The American people have ``got to be prepared to spend a lot more
money on corrections,'' Burger said, ``But 30 years of experience
convinces me it would pay off in the long run.''
   Burger said he decided to speak out on the prison furlough issue
after being contacted by prison experts and by a number of inmates.

   President Daniel Ortega said late
Tuesday that he expects George Bush's presidential victory will mean
better relations between the United States and Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government.
   ``We hope in this case Bush doesn't commit the same errors that
(President) Reagan did,'' Ortega told a news conference.
   Ortega said ``it wouldn't be strange'' if the new Republican
president requests renewed military aid for Nicaraguan rebels but
said that would be ``a very serious error.''
   Bush has said he backs renewed Contra military aid, which ended
Feb. 29 and the Democratic-led U.S. Congress has refused to renew.
Most rebel fighters have since moved to bases in neighboring
Honduras.
   Asked about prospective relations with the Bush administration,
Ortega said: ``I think that Mr. Bush doesn't have the commitment
that President Reagan had with the counterrevolutionary project.''
He said earlier Tuesday that Reagan is obsessed with overthrowing
the Sandinistas.
   Ortega, in a later interview with the NBC-TV network, said, ``I
hope Mr. Bush has a more realist policy to follow, so that he can
reach an understanding with Nicaragua. What I hope is that I find in
him the will to find a solution to the Central American crisis.
   ``He was part of the problem, now he must be convinced that that
was a mistaken policy because it is a policy that has failed.''
   Ortega said Bush's first step should be to resume talks with
Nicaragua that the United States cut off in 1985.
   The Reagan administration says Nicaragua is a beachhead for
communism that threatens U.S. security, and cut off aid in 1981. It
began financing rebels, called Contras, that year and imposed a
trade embargo in 1985.
   Rebel commander Enrique Bermudez said Tuesday the Contras would
continue fighting even without the U.S. military aid suspended.
Contra-Sandinista talks aimed at ending the 7-year-old conflict have
had little success.
   ``If the United States abandons its friends who fight for
democracy ... we will continue the fight,'' he said on clandestine
Radio Liberacion. ``Our fight is not based on support from the
United States.''

   Following his wife's example, Soviet human rights
activist Andrei Sakharov underwent a heart examination as part of
his first trip to the West.
   The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner, who was examined
Tuesday, might receive a pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat before
returning to Moscow, a family member said. Sakharov suffers from
chronic angina, or chest pain.
   His wife, Yelena Bonner, came to the same hospital, Massachusetts
General, for heart bypass surgery in 1986.
   The hospital said it would not release test results or provide
any other medical information for the next 10 to 14 days, at the
request of Sakharov's family.
   His son-in-law, Efrem Yankelevich, says if doctors decide a
pacemaker is needed, Sakharov will undergo surgery before returning
to the Soviet Union later this month.
   The physicist is scheduled to fly home Nov. 18, but relatives and
colleagues have said his visa is flexible and could be extended.
   Yankelevich said last week that pacemakers, which are implanted
under the skin, are not generally available in the Soviet Union.
   Though frail, Sakharov has maintained a demanding schedule and
appears to be in generally good health.
   He is believed to have suffered a minor stroke when Soviet
authorities force-fed him during a 1985 hunger strike.
   That fast, which lasted several weeks, prompted the Soviet
authorities to allow his wife to come to Boston for heart surgery.
She had suffered two heart attacks.
   Sakharov was also weakened by a hunger strike in 1981, said
Joshua Rubenstein, an Amnesty International specialist on Soviet
dissidents. That 18-day fast forced the Soviets to allow a young
woman, Elizaveta Alekseyeva, to emigrate to the United States to
marry Sakharov's stepson, Alexei Semyonov.
   ``But it wasn't just the hunger strikes themselves that caused
the damage,'' Rubenstein said. ``It was the psychologcial pressure,
the isolation, being force-fed, the stroke. Being force-fed is a
form of torture, after all.''
   Sakharov has commented little on his physical condition. Asked at
a news conference Monday about his health, he said only that ``it
hasn't changed either way'' recently.
   On Friday, he is scheduled to travel to New York City for a
luncheon given by the Union of Concerned Scientists. From New York,
he plans to go to Washington for a board meeting of the
International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity, of which he is a director.
   On Monday, Sakharov plans to visit President Reagan at the White
House.
   In two public appearances since his arrival four days ago,
Sakharov has called attention to Soviet political prisoners and
warned that perestroika, the restructuring of his country's
political and economic system, faces a grave threat from new laws
restricting demonstrations and increasing police powers.
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for championing
human rights, was banished to the closed city of Gorky in 1980 for
his opposition to Soviet presence in Afghanistan. Sakharov's living
conditions during his internal exile were harsh and he frequently
carried a 30-pound bag with his possessions, Rubenstein said.
   In 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev allowed Sakharov to
return to Moscow.

<BYLINE>His Troubles Aren't Over: Delayed Revenge Await Dukakis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In ancient Greece, the Spartans sent their warriors
off to battle with the cry: ``Return carrying your shield or lying
upon it.'' Words with fresh meaning for returning governor Michael
Dukakis.
   Now that voters have sent the governor home to Massachusetts from
the battlefield of national politics, he may need a shield to
protect himself from the second-guessing, delayed revenge and flat
out sense of disappointment felt by an ambivalent populace and an
openly restive legislature.
   ``It's going to be unpleasant,'' state Rep. William Galvin, a
Boston Democrat who is part of the House leadership, said of
Dukakis' return to the Statehouse.
   Others compare Dukakis' plight to the Boston Red Sox, another
home team that fell short this year in pursuit of a national title.
Boston can be a fickle town, and having done no better in the big
leagues than the baseball team, Dukakis could be in for a long, cold
winter.
   Even before Tuesday's voting, speculation was rampant in the
Statehouse hallways about Dukakis' future in Massachusetts. Two
years remain in his gubernatorial term.
   Most observers said he would be well advised to keep his options
open, to avoid the political weakness of a lame duck. If he chooses
to seek an unprecedented fourth term in 1990, Dukakis would probably
scare off a few politicians, but he could still face challengers.
   Just two years after winning a landslide re-election, Dukakis
held onto his home state in the presidential voting by just 8
percent over Bush. He fell far short of the 35 percent margin he ran
up in the 1986 governor's race.
   To make matters worse, Massachusetts voters endorsed a ballot
question repealing a 1987 government pay-raise package. That will
cost Dukakis $10,000.
   ``Wednesday could be even worse than Tuesday,'' said Galvin,
citing the state's fiscal problems, including last week's news of
tax collections falling behind projections and the state's overdraft
at the Bank of Boston last month by as much as $190 million.
   But John DeVillars, the governor's deputy chief of staff,
maintained that Dukakis was in good shape before he lost to
Republican George Bush.
   He cited the governor's endorsement by The Boston Globe, the
administration's success in sustaining Dukakis' budget vetoes and
the signing of an auto insurance reform bill along lines proposed by
Dukakis.
   But the governor's aide acknowledged that the state's revenue and
cash-management problems would force Dukakis to ``make some very
tough choices and momentarily unpopular decisions.''
   Publicly, the state's leading Democrats closed ranks behind
Dukakis late Tuesday, with Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn saying Dukakis
``had nothing to be ashamed of'' and state party chairman Rep.
Chester Atkins adding, `He's really put his all on the line, and I
would hope that's appreciated and rewarded.''
   But Republican David Locke, the state Senate minority leader and
a Massachusetts co-chairman for Bush, saw a ``seething discontent
within the Democratic Party for Dukakis.''
   Locke said most Bay State politicians have gone easy on Dukakis
in recent months, because ``they knew he was going to be either
president or governor, and elected officials did not want to get on
the wrong side.'' Now, though, Locke said his colleagues in the
Legislature smell blood in the water.
   The problem, according to most observers, is not ideological.
Instead, Dukakis appears to be the victim of his status as a chief
executive and of his own political style.
   As governor, he is a lightning rod for all sorts of discontent
and gets blamed for everything from unheated subways to a potential
budget deficit caused by giving Massachusetts residents a tax break
last year. ``If there's a blizzard this winter he'll get blamed for
it,'' Galvin said.
   Locke cited the governor's ``arrogance, his aloofness from the
crowd'' as a factor. ``He's never been one of the boys.
Consequently, I do not think he has the broad base of goodwill that
others in his position might have.''
   As he slid in the national polls, Dukakis also took a battering
at home throughout September and October.
   A majority of House members voted to override his budget vetoes,
the Boston Herald ran a three-part, front-page endorsement of Bush,
a federal court ruled that the governor could not block National
Guard training assignments and the state had to borrow another $225
million to pay its bills.

<HEAD>Bush's Opening Acts: Olive Branches to Congress, Outreach to
Kremlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush likely will open his presidency by
offering an olive branch to Congress, calling a summit with NATO
allies and seeking an early meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev so each can size up the other.
   Moreover, Bush promises a global conference about the
environment, a hemispheric summit on illegal drugs and a meeting
with the nation's governors to discuss educational standards.
   Yet, whatever Bush hopes to accomplish with all these meetings is
mostly a mystery, hidden by the cloud of campaign smoke from
emotional issues such as gun control and the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Even some Republican strategists are puzzled about his aims.
   ``Now that he's gotten elected, he's got to figure out what are
the critical issues he wants to deal with,'' said Thomas Griscom,
onetime White House communications chief for President Reagan.
   ``It ain't gonna be about Willie Horton and the American flag,''
Griscom said. Horton was the Massachusetts murderer whose furlough
from prison was used by Bush as a symbol of Michael Dukakis'
supposedly soft stand on crime.
   Lyn Nofziger, who was Reagan's first White House political
director, said of Bush, ``I think he likes the idea of being
president. I don't think he has any bold ideas.''
   Griscom observed, ``Maybe you don't have to have broad, sweeping
ideas. Maybe stability is enough.''
   In 73 days, Bush will take the oath of office. His presidency
promises to be a change largely of style rather than substance. Bush
made his campaign a referendum on Reagan's stewardship and pledged
to stay the course, with minor changes.
   A president known as the great communicator will be replaced by
one who acknowledges he's not a great speaker and may lack charisma.
   There may be some surprises, especially in staffing the Bush
administration. After all, no one expected Bush to pick Sen. Dan
Quayle as his running mate.
   And when Bush takes the oath of office, three liberal judges on
the Supreme Court will be 80 years old. Bush has promised to appoint
moderate persons of conservative views.
   Whatever is on his agenda, Bush will have to deal with a Congress
still firmly in the hands of Democrats. There is a widespread
expectation Bush will try to make peace with the Democrats after a
nasty campaign.
   ``His problem is that there's going to be virtually no
honeymoon,'' said GOP consultant David Keene. ``The Democrats in
Congress are of the opinion that the Republicans took over in 1980
and they had their honeymoon, and now it's business as usual and
partisan warfare from day one.''
   Bush pledged Tuesday night, ``I'll do my level best to reach out
and work constructively with the United States Congress.''
   Bush, whose political anchor has never been set in concrete,
promises to bring to the White House a less ideological brand of
leadership than Reagan.
   He likely will be more of a hands-on manager than Reagan, more
involved in the day-to-day operation of government but not as deeply
absorbed in the mechanics as Jimmy Carter was.
   Bush is a delegator. He believes that the best way to develop
goals and get things done is to put the right people in the right
places.
   ``I suspect that George Bush will want a staff that includes sort
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around
him,'' said Keene, who once worked for him.
   James A. Baker III, the former Treasury secretary who was Bush's
campaign chairman, is expected to play a major role in selecting the
people and planning the policies for a Bush administration.
   Baker is considered a sure bet to wind up as secretary of state.
Former Sen. John Tower of Texas has been campaigning hard to be
secretary of defense.
   Bush is expected to keep Nicholas Brady as treasury secretary,
Dick Thornburgh as attorney general, Lauro Cavazos as education
secretary and Ann McLaughlin as labor secretary or in another
Cabinet post.
   Craig Fuller, who is Bush's chief of staff, is considered a top
candidate to be White House chief of staff. However, New Hampshire
Gov. John Sununu also is considered a contender for that job, or
else to be secretary of energy.
   The first appointments on Bush's post-election agenda are with
visiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday. They both will be in
Washington for talks with Reagan.
   Mrs. Thatcher would like to see next June's scheduled NATO
foreign ministers' meeting upgraded to a full NATO summit to develop
strategy for dealing with a rapidly changing Kremlin. Bush already
has proposed a NATO summit, so it's likely they'll be talking on the
same wave length.
   That could pave the way for Bush to meet with Gorbachev. Bush
said recently he would like to meet the Soviet leader at ``the
earliest time'' so they can size each other up and determine how to
move ahead with strategic and conventional arms talks and deal with
other problems.
   Among the first major domestic problems facing Bush are the
budget deficit and the national debt. Interest payments alone on the
debt will hit $160 billion in the fiscal year 1989.
   Bush has promised to personally lead negotiations with Congress
on deficit-reduction and has called for a ``flexible freeze'' on all
federal spending except Social Security that would allow programs,
including defense, to grow no faster than inflation.
   But he hasn't said what programs would be cut to free money for
increases in spending on education and child care that he promised
during the campaign.

<HEAD>Regulators Worried About Banks' Role In Takeover Lending</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are growing increasingly
concerned about the vulnerability of banks participating in
``leveraged buyouts,'' or corporate takeovers in which the buyer
uses mostly borrowed funds to make the acquisition.
   A spokeswoman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which regulates 4,450 nationally chartered banks, said Tuesday that
the agency's examiners will receive new guidelines within the next
several weeks requiring them to evaluate financial institutions'
risk from making loans in leveraged buyouts.
   ``We want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis of
exactly what the risks are,'' spokeswoman Lee Cross said.
   Leveraged buyouts have become increasingly common in recent years
amid an explosion of corporate takeovers.
   Two weeks ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
whose agency regulates bank holding companies, told the Senate
Banking Committee he has warned banks making leveraged buyout loans
to consider borrowers' prospects ``in a range of economic and
financial circumstances.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures commercial bank deposits, has said the
proliferation of leveraged buyouts is increasing the risk to the
financial system.
   In a leveraged buyout, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s
$20.6 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group uses
mostly borrowed money to purchase a company. The debt is repaid
either with the acquired company's cash flow or with money raised by
the sale of some of its assets.
   Often the investors are the target company's managers, who are
acting to thwart a threatened takeover by outsiders.
   The popularity of such deals and the resulting mushrooming of
debt has led to concern about the ability of debt-burdened companies
to withstand an economic downturn.
   Critics of the financing trend say most of the deals have been
put together since 1982, when the economy began expanding, and have
not been tested by a recession.
   If a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn, the value of
its stock falls. However, a highly leveraged company could be forced
into bankruptcy after a setback to pay creditors.
   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company which
monitors large bank loans to corporations, banks have lent $70
billion to highly-leveraged transactions since mid-1987. Leveraged
buyout and takeover lending comprised 59 percent of the banks big
corporate loans in the July-September quarter.
   Ms. Cross said the comptroller's office began revising its
leveraged buyout guidelines after surveying the practices of 11
large money center banks and five regional institutions in late
spring and early summer.
   ``We found that so far the banks that have been involved seem to
have taken a pretty reasonable approach. ... No bank was perfect ...
but we did not see any really substantial problems,'' Ms. Cross said.
   But, she said, ``Our concern now is going forward as competition
in this area heats up.''
   The new examiniation guidelines will not impose limits on
leveraged buyout lending, but Ms. Cross said they will direct
examiners to determine if a banks' policies include limits on such
lending as a whole and limits for single deals.
   One problem in developing the guidelines is that banks have
widely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveraged
lending, she said.

   The high-level advisory commission on the
federal budget deficit probably will miss its self-imposed deadline
for producing a plan to reduce the government's red ink, one of the
panel's co-chairmen says.
   Democrat Robert Strauss says the recommendations from the
National Economic Commission may not be delivered to the Bush
administration and Congress until March 1 or even later.
   The commission will hold a full day of hearings on Nov. 16, with
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan heading up a list of big
names expected to testify.
   This hearing had been billed as a showcase that would launch the
panel into a month of intensive deliberations aimed at coming up
with a deficit reduction plan by Dec. 21, in time to influence the
next administration's first budget submission to Congress.
   But Strauss said Tuesday those plans will likely be scrapped in
favor of a more leisurely approach to the budget deliberations, if
that meets the wishes of President-elect George Bush.
   The 12-member commission, created by Congress last December, was
viewed by many as offering the best hope of breaking through the
seven-year political deadlock over reducing the federal budget
deficit.
   Supporters hoped the commission would be able to come up with a
package of spending cuts and tax increases that would be acceptable
to Congress and the next president.
   But Bush has already said he will ignore any recommendations for
higher taxes to reduce the deficit.
   At its first meeting last May, the commission announced it had
agreed to an accelerated schedule that would have a final report
completed by Dec. 21 so the panel's recommendations could help shape
the Bush administration's first budget package. The law set a March
1 deadline while giving the president the option of extending the
deadline to Sept. 1.
   Strauss' comments Tuesday at a conference sponsored by the
American Stock Exchange were the first public confirmation of
reports that the commission would not meet its self-imposed
deadline. He conceded the panel was ``going to have a hard time''
coming up with an acceptable package.
   Two Republican members of the panel, former defense secretaries
Caspar Weinberger and Donald Rumsfeld, want faster growth in
military spending but at the same time oppose higher taxes.
   Another panelist, Dean Kleckner, president of the American Farm
Bureau Federation, has said he will work to block recommendations
for tax increases.
   In comments to reporters after his speech, Strauss said he was
not totally ruling out an attempt by the commission to complete its
work before Christmas, but he said such an effort would not be
launched without approval from Bush, who will appoint the final two
members of the panel.
   ``Whatever he wants, he can have,'' Strauss said of the
president-elect.

   The government may seek a search warrant or
subpoenas to get documents from Cornell University before the FBI
tries to interview the graduate student who is the focus of a
computer ``virus'' probe, federal law enforcement sources say.
   Thomas Guidoboni, the lawer for Robert Morris Jr., said Tuesday
he hasn't been contacted by the FBI since informing the bureau that
he was representing the 23-year-old Morris.
   ``The ball's in their (the FBI's) court, we're waiting to hear
from them,'' said Guidoboni.
   Prior to the Morris family's retaining Guidoboni, the bureau had
sought to question the student, said his father, Robert Morris Sr.
of Arnold, Md.
   Guidoboni said he didn't think ``we'll have enough information by
the end of this week'' to determine whether to talk to the FBI and
that he wants to talk more with his client before deciding what
course of action to take.
   The possibility of seeking grand jury subpoenas or a search
warrant for data at Cornell that could shed light on the computer
virus incident was considered Tuesday within the FBI. It was
discarded as being unnecessary and then revived in discussions with
Justice Department lawyers, said the sources, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   M. Stuart Lynn, the university's vice president for information
technologies, reiterated that Cornell will cooperate fully with the
investigation.
   The virus paralyzed more than 6,000 university and military
computers nationwide last Wednesday and Thursday.
   A computer virus is a tiny program that invades data processors
and disrupts normal operation of the machines. A virus duplicates
itself, spreading into other programs in the computer and infecting
one computer after another as users share floppy disks or link up
over telephone lines.
   The virus last week apparently rapidly duplicated itself, thereby
slowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.

   Weary but happy after three sleepless final days
and two years of raising money, Bob Farmer was ready to rest.
   Farmer, the finance guru of Michael Dukakis' campaign, helped the
Democratic Party raise $56 million _ five times what Walter Mondale
raised in 1984 and a record amount for the traditionally
cash-strapped party.
   ``I am very happy we provided the Democratic Party with the
ability to compete on a level playing field for the first time in
history with the Republicans,'' Farmer said at an election night
party for 500 thrown by his party's finance committee.
   The Democrats' so-called Victory Fund '88 exceeded its $50
million target with 325,000 donors, an average of more than $150 per
contribution.
   But it was the fat cats who mattered most. At least 142
individuals donated $100,000 or more, many of them Greek-Americans
with immigrant roots like the Democratic presidential nominee. In
New York state alone Greek-Americans gave $1 million.
   ``We felt a great deal of pride that one of our own could have a
chance at bat for the greatest office in the world,'' said John
Catsimatidis, a first-generation Greek-American and chairman of the
$2 billion Red Apple supermarket chain.
   Farmer's relentless telephone-calling and other financial
hectoring paid off for Dukakis. The Massachusettts governor dwarfed
his Democratic rivals in the primaries, raising $27 million.
   By June 30, 1987, the campaign already had raised $4.2 million, a
three-month record for a Democrat.
   ``People felt it was going to be an important part of the primary
race and that turned out to be true,'' said Stanley S. Shuman, a New
York investment banker and $100,000-plus contributor who grew up
with the governor in Brookline, Mass.
   The Republican Party again proved richer, raising $92 million.
But on election night the Democratic contributors didn't care,
especially the Greeks.
   ``Regardless of what happens tonight, we are very proud,'' said
Clay Constantinidou, a 37-year-old lawyer from Colt's Neck, N.J.,
who grew up in Cyprus and chaired Dukakis' New Jersey finance
effort. ``We are winners.''

   Nebraskans on Tuesday narrowly approved a
constitutional amendment allowing 17-year-olds to vote in primary
elections if their 18th birthday is before the general election.
   With 1,698 of 1,878 precincts reporting, or 90 percent, 264,056
voters, or 51 percent, supported the amendment, and 253,034, or 49
percent, opposed it.
   The amendment makes a person eligible to vote ``for the calendar
year in which such citizen has attained the age of 18 years.''
   The measure generated spirited debate in the Legislature, which
put the question to voters.
   Proponents said teens who turn 18 after the primary but before
the general election are disenfranchised by the existing law, which
requires they be 18 before the primary.

<HEAD>Text of President's Thanksgiving Proclamation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Reagan's
Thanksgiving proclamation for 1988:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The celebration of Thanksgiving Day is one of our nation's most
venerable and cherished traditions. Almost 200 years ago, the first
president of these United States, George Washington, issued the
first national Thanksgiving Day proclamation under the Constitution
and recommended to the American people that they ``be devoted to
service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent
Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.''
   He called upon them to raise ``prayers and supplications to the
Great Lord and Ruler of Nations,'' not merely for continued
blessings on our own land but on all rulers and nations that they
might know ``good government, peace and concord.''
   A century ago, President Grover Cleveland called for ``prayers
and song of praise'' that would render to God the appreciation of
the American people for his mercy and for the nation through the
labor of its farmers, shopkeepers and tradesmen.
   Both of these proclamations included something else as well: a
recognition of our shortcomings and transgressions and our
dependence, in total and in every particular, on the forgiveness and
forbearance of the Almighty.
   Today, cognizant of our American heritage of freedom and
opportunity, we are again called to gratitude, thanksgiving and
contrition. Thanksgiving Day summons every American to pause in the
midst of activity, however necessary and valuable, to give simple
and humble thanks to God.
   This gracious gratitude is the ``service'' of which Washington
spoke. It is a service that opens our hearts to one another as
members of a single family gathered around the bounteous table of
God's Creation. The images of the Thanksgiving celebrations at
America's earliest settlement _ of Pilgrim and Iroquois Confederacy
assembled in ferstive friendship _ resonate with even greater power
in our own day.
   People from every race, culture and creed on the face of the
Earth now inhabit this land. Their presence illuminates the basic
yearning for freedom, peace, and prosperity that has always been the
spirit of the New World.
   In this year when we as a people enjoy the fruits of economic
growth and international cooperation, let us take time both to
remember the sacrifices that have made this harvest possible and the
needs of those who do not fully partake of its benefits.
   The wonder of our agricultural abundance must be recalled as the
work of farmers who, under the best and worst of conditions, give
their all to raise food upon the land. The gratitude that fills our
being must be tempered with compassion for the needy.
   The blessings that are ours must be understood as the gift of a
loving God Whose greatest gift is healing. Let us join then, with
the psalmist of old:
   O give thanks to the Lord, call on His name,
   Make known His deeds among the peoples!
   Sing to Him, sing praises to Him,
   Tell of all His wonderful works!
   Glory in His holy name;
   Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice!

Abortions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout, adds early returns from California ballot
issues, and deletes extraneous material</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Maryland handed the gun lobby a major setback on Tuesday,
abortion foes won key victories in Michigan and Colorado, and
Massachusetts and Nebraska residents gave votes of confidence to
nuclear power.
   In California, meanwhile, a record $60 million media blitz by car
insurers seemed to be paying off as voters were rejecting four
propositions aimed at cutting auto premiums and reforming
rate-setting practices, including one measure backed by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader that would have slashed rates by more than 20
percent.
   Early returns also showed Californians rejecting an anti-AIDS
measure backed by Paul Gann that would force doctors to tell health
officials the identities of AIDS sufferers. It was losing by 61-39
percent with 21 percent of the precincts reporting. But a rival
measure requiring AIDS testing for persons accused of certain crimes
was getting voter approval in the early going.
   But 58 percent of California voters were endorsing a 25-cent hike
in the cigarette tax, with 14 percent of the vote in. Proceeds of
the tax would go toward promoting health.
   In other major ballot contests, Oregonians rejected what would
have been the nation's toughest anti-smoking law, Florida and
Colorado made English their official state language, New Yorkers
approved a record $3 billion borrowing to repair roads, and the tax
revolt failed to catch fire in Colorado and Utah.
   With 82 percent of the precincts reporting, 58 percent of
Maryland voters upheld a 6-month-old state law effectively banning
cheap handguns known as ``Saturday night specials.'' The National
Rifle Association had poured more than $4 million into a media
campaign to repeal it.
   In Michigan, voters approved a ban on state-financed abortions
for poor women except to save the life of the mother. With 28
percent of the precincts reporting, 560,900, or 61 percent favored a
ban, while 357,765, or 39 percent were opposed.
   Coloradans likewise voted against state-funded abortions by a
62-38 percent margin, with 20 percent of the vote in. With one-third
of Arkansas' vote tallied, a proposed amendment that would protect
life beginning at conception and forbid state-financed abortions had
a slim, 51-49 percent lead.
   With 56 percent of the vote in, 68 percent of Massachusetts
voters rejected an initiative, opposed by Gov. Michael Dukakis,
effectively shutting down the state's two nuclear plants.
   Another Massachusetts initiative aimed at protecting farm animals
from cruelty was being trounced by a 71-29 percent margin, with 56
percent of the vote tallied; 58 percent of that state's voters were
rejecting a measure that would have repealed the ``prevailing wage''
law requiring union wages on public projects.
   In all, voters in 41 states faced 238 statewide ballot questions
_ 29 in California alone.
   Elsewhere, Kentucky voters overwhelmingly endorsed a proposed
lottery by a 61-39 percent margin, and Indianans likewise passed a
lottery measure. Idaho and Minnesota also had lottery proposals on
their ballots.
   In Florida, 83 percent of voters decided to declare English the
official state language with 79 percent of the tally in. Coloradans
endorsed a similar amendment by a 62-38 percent margin with 20
percent of the vote in. The vote was closer in Arizona: 53 percent
in favor, 47 percent opposed, with 8 percent of the vote in.
   Among the more stringent tax-cutting measures, South Dakotans
were rejecting Proposition II, which would roll back property taxes
and limit future increases, by a 63-37 percent margin. Opponents,
including Gov. George Mickelson, warned the measure cold cost
government up to $112 million.
   Coloradans defeated Amendment 6, the so-called ``Taxpayers Bill
of Rights Amendment,'' which would cut income taxes about 10
percent, limit property taxes and require voter approval on future
hikes except in emergencies. The measure was losing, 57 percent to
43 percent, with 20 percent of the vote tallied.
   In Utah, voters overwhelmingly rejected three tax initiatives
that together would have lowered state and local revenues by $329
million. One would have limited property taxes, the second would
have rolled back income, sales, gasoline and cigarette taxes, and a
third would have grant tax credits for private education.
   Nevadans voted on a constitutional prohibition on income taxes.
   On the other side, Arkansas residents rejected a ``Fair Tax
Amendment'' that would have made it easier for the legislature to
raise certain taxes. With 33 percent of the vote in, it failed by
62-38 percent.
   Among other major ballot contests:
   _ Florida residents rejected an amendment limiting liability
claims for bodily injury to $100,000 for non-economic losses such as
pain and suffering.
   _ New Yorkers approved a record $3 billion borrowing to repair
roads and bridges. With 79 percent of precincts reporting, 1,704,659
or 54 percent were in favor, 1,477,287 or 46 percent were against.
   _ South Dakotans were endorsing a ban on corporate hog farming by
a 62-38 percent margin.
   And early returns showed voters in that state in favor of a
measure legalizing gambling in Deadwood, a Black Hills town where
Wild Bill Hickok died playing poker and where townspeople are now
anxious for money to preserve wild-west architecture.
   A third South Dakota measure requiring strip miners to restore
land to original counters where possible was failing by a 58-42
percent margin with 158 of 1,149 precincts reporting.
   Kentucky residents strongly endorsed a measure restricting
strip-mining rights. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, the
vote was 868,634 yes, 192,240 against.
   _ In Nebraska, residents decided against becoming the first state
to withdraw from an interstate nuclear waste compact.
   _ Montanans decided whether to repeal that state's year-old seat
belt law. Oregon voters rejected a new seat belt ordinance.
   Montana residents also voted on whether to become the tenth state
to enact a ``bottle bill'' requiring return deposits on beverage
containers.
   _ In Oregon, voters rejected an anti-smoking ordinance that would
have banned smoking in most public places. With 36 percent of the
ballots counted, Measure 6 was failing by a 61-39 percent margin.
   _ Another California proposal required restoration of funds for
the state's Occupational Safety and Health Agency dismantled last
year by Gov. George Deukmejian.
   _ Washington voters chose between two rival measures dealing with
hazardous waste disposal.
   _ With 46 percent of the vote in, Oregon voters overturned Gov.
Neil Goldschmidt's order protecting homosexual state workers from
discrimination by a 54-46 percent margin.
   Fort Collins, Colo., voters turned down a proposed gay rights
initiative by a 56-43 percent margin, with 67 of 164 precincts
counted.
   _ Among other notable local contests, residents of Cape Cod,
Mass., were approving limits on development by a 2-1 margin, and
some two dozen California communities considered similar curbs.
   San Francisco voters decided whether to allow the homeporting of
the USS Missouri, site of the Japanese surrender during World War II.
   Boston residents voted on whether to permit predominantly black
neighborhoods to break off as a separate city to be named after
South African black nationalist Nelson Mandela.
   And the college towns of Berkeley, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass.,
had referendums supporting Palestinian rights and demanding Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza.

<TEXT>
   The networks leaped up in the middle of the first
act of Tuesday night's election drama and shouted, ``The butler did
it!''
   Once again, television projected the winner in the presidential
race, thanks to those dreaded exit polls, before many voters had a
chance to cast their ballots.
   CBS led the way at 9:17 p.m. EST, an hour and 43 minutes before
polls closed on the West Coast. ABC followed at 9:20. NBC was the
most restrained of the big three, waiting until 10:30 to call the
race for George Bush. CNN called it at 10:42, based on counted votes.
   ABC's computer did misfire, calling Maryland for Dukakis. The
network later retracted the projection and put it in Bush's column.
   Network projections based on sophisticated exit polling _
interviews with voters who have already cast ballots _ have been a
controversy since 1980, when NBC called the race for Ronald Reagan
at 8:15. There were reports from California of voters walking off
lines at polling places, figuring their votes didn't count anymore.
The critics' complaint is that those voters could have made a
difference, if not in the presidential race, then in local races and
referenda.
   The networks will argue the projections are news. They are news _
news created by the networks. What's next? Seeding clouds, then
breathlessly reporting rain?
   Election night is getting to be an exercise in anticlimax. The
poll-crazy networks, as well as the rest of the news media, called
the race days, if not weeks ago. ABC led its Sunday newscast with a
projection that 439 electoral votes were in or leaning toward Bush's
column while Dukakis could count 30. CBS' news on Election Day
morning led with a poll showing Bush leading Dukakis by 9 percent.
   Then Tuesday night, the networks reported low turnout in many
states and sent correspondents out into the field to ask voters why
they were so apathetic.
   Polls are like predicting the sex of the baby. Some of us would
rather wait to find out after nature takes its course.
   Over at CNN's waiting room, there was more traditional pacing.
CNN called races the old-fashioned way _ they stuck their neck out
and guessed, based on small percentages of the vote already counted.
   CNN's reporting was superb. It covered issues region by region,
examined key congressional races, interviewed key politicians. Races
were called with all appropriate speed, but it was leisurely,
informative, good ol' reporting.
   And it entertained. CNN's bumpers were beautifully edited
snippets from the year's campaign coverage, enough to make even the
most cynical voter look back a little mistily: Dukakis throwing a
football; cut to Bush catching one. Bush staring into a fish tank,
surrounded by kindergarteners, insisting, ``I can talk to fish.''
Dukakis gritting his teeth while an insistent tot yanks painfully on
his tie.
   Over on CBS, Dan Rather was slinging the similes like, well, an
anchorman on election night: ``George Bush is sweeping through the
South like a tornado through a trailer park!'' ``Some of these
Senate races are crackling like a hickory fire!'' Occasionally one
got away: ``Bush is jumping off like a rabbit with a ... a real fast
headstart!''
   Since the primaries, Dan has expanded into metaphors, however:
``The buzzards are beginning to circle over Dukakis' chances.''
``George Bush turns out to be the best milker on the farm (in
Nebraska).''
   After CBS had called the race, Rather assured voters their
ballots still counted. ``Let me pause and say that is our CBS News
estimate. ... Our headline of the moment is that George Bush has
been elected,'' he said. ``It does make a difference, those of you
in states where polls haven't closed, whether you vote.''
   Minutes later he was asking Jesse Jackson how it felt now that
the Democratic ticket was ``not only going to lose but going to be
absolutely swamped.''
   Aware that his competition had long since called it, NBC's Tom
Brokaw seemed to go slightly haywire at one point, declaring that
123 states had gone to George Bush.
   Fifteen minutes after calling the race based on exit polls, ABC's
Peter Jennings offered what almost amounted to an apology on the
air, remarking to colleague David Brinkley, ``I must confess, I'm
feeling a bit defensive.''
   On CNN, where such things could be spouted, former network
correspondent Linda Ellerbee vented her spleen at exit polling and
the networks' ``scoop mentality.'' Echoing Chicago columnist Mike
Royko's suggestion of 1984, she called for right-thinking citizens
to foil pollsters by fibbing to them.
   ``You lie your head off,'' she suggested, ``from one end of the
ballot to the other, from sea to shining sea. Imagine if television
called the wrong winner. Maybe we can't teach television manners,
but we can teach it a little humility.''

<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito's condition stabilized and he
appeared to be feeling better today despite another discharge of
blood, palace doctors said.
   On Tuesday, the 87-year-old monarch suffered his worst crisis
since Sept. 19, when was bedridden with internal hemorrhaging.
   Officials quoted Grand Steward Shoichi Fujimori as saying
Hirohito appeared to be feeling better today. Fujimori said the
emperor asked him to express his ``best regards to all the people
who have come to pay their respects.''
   A steady stream of well-wishers has visited the Imperial Palace
in central Tokyo daily since Hirohito fell ill.
   Kenji Maeda, spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency, said
Hirohito discharged some blood Tuesday night, and that doctors gave
him 0.42 pints of blood in a transfusion.
   This morning, the emperor's blood pressure was 118 over 58, a
sharp improvement from Tuesday evening's 68 over 30 reading. A
normal blood pressure reading is 120 over 80. Hirohito's fever,
which rose to 103.2 degrees on Tuesday, was 99.7 this morning, Maeda
added.
   Doctors said the emperor slept well Tuesday night, contributing
to his stabilizing condition. Physicians have been on emergency
standby since Sunday, with three doctors staying overnight at the
palace.
   Palace sources say it's become difficult to continue bloody
transfusions because doctors are having difficulty finding suitable
veins to administer the transfusions.
   Hirohito, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has received
41.56 pints of blood since Sept. 19. Doctors say he is bleeding
internally in the upper intestinal area.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm reports that Hirohito
has cancer.

   George Bush owes his victory to the votes of
white, American males. If women and blacks had had their way,
Michael Dukakis would be president-elect today.
   That picture emerged from exit polls the networks conducted with
tens of thousands of voters Tuesday.
   The Republican vice president stitched together much of the old
Reagan coalition, despite some defections that allowed his
Democratic rival to make a far more respectable showing than Jimmy
Carter in 1980 or Walter Mondale in 1984.
   The exit polls showed Bush's strong suits were the economy, a
strong defense and experience. He routed Dukakis in the South, but
the Democrat ran strongly in the West.
   NBC News pollster Sheldon Gawiser said the economy was foremost
in voters' minds. ``People are pretty pleased with the way things
are,'' he said.
   An ABC News exit poll of 22,000 voters found Bush was the choice
of men, 54-44 percent, while women preferred Dukakis, 52-47. Blacks
went for Dukakis, 89-9, but they were only 8 percent of those polled
by ABC.
   Bush carried the white vote, 55-44 percent, while Dukakis won the
Hispanic vote, 68-31, according to ABC, which said its poll had a
margin of error of two percentage points.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, drew high marks for his
vision, concern for the poor and honesty _ but fewer people were
concerned about those qualities.
   Dukakis got 52 percent of the blue-collar vote, once a gimme for
the Democrats. Bush got 47 percent.
   Voters from union households went for Dukakis, 67-32, while
people with no family tie to a union were in Bush's camp, 53-46, ABC
said.
   Dotty Lynch, chief political editor for CBS, said Dukakis ``fell
down in the industrial rust belt areas. The yuppier areas he did
well in.''
   The CBS-New York Times poll of more than 10,000 voters, with a
two-point margin of error, also showed Bush winning among men,
55-43, and losing among women, 51-48.
   ``What basically happened was that Dukakis failed to carry men
and his margin with women was not enough to offset the problem,''
said Lynch.
   In the ABC poll, one voter in four cited the candidates'
experience as a foremost issue, and they went with Bush, 93-6.
   Those who felt strongly the presidential candidate ``cares about
people like me'' were Dukakis supporters, 87-12.
   A third of those polled by ABC said the abortion issue was very
important; they went for Bush, 54-45. One in nine said prison
furloughs were a very important issue; they were for Bush, 83-16.
Among the one-in-five who ranked Social Security among the uppermost
issues, Dukakis was the choice, 59-39, ABC said.
   CBS's Lynch felt the crime issue worked for Bush. In the CBS-New
York Times poll of more than 10,000 voters, 25 percent of Bush
voters cited crime as a top reason for voting for Bush.
   Dukakis gained back some of the Roman Catholic votes that
deserted the Democrats for Reagan. Catholics chose Dukakis, 54-46,
and Jews went with the Democrat, 71-28, according to ABC. But Bush
pulled a formidable 59-40 majority of the Protestant vote.
   Bush pulled in 16 percent of the Democrats' vote _ less than
Reagan's 24 percent _ and carried the independents, 53-45, while
Dukakis got 8 percent of the Republicans, ABC said.
   Bush won handily among college-graduates (56-43), while Dukakis
carried those with only a high school diploma (51-48) and dropouts
(62-37), ABC said.
   Dukakis won, 58-41, among voters from families making less than
$20,000 a year. Bush won those in the $20,000-to-$40,000 bracket by
51-48, and those above $40,000 by 58-41.
   Bush won among voters in their late 20s and 50s and led narrowly
among those in their 30s and 40s, ABC said, while Dukakis had a
narrow edge among the youngest voters (under 25) and oldest (60 or
older).
   An ABC analyst, who asked that his name not be used, said,
``Clearly the American electorate made up its mind early.'' While
Dukakis got up to 62 percent of the votes of those who made up their
minds in the race's closing days, Bush won, 53-46, among the
4-out-of-5 voters who decided more than a week ago.
   Bush's choice of Dan Quayle, the 41-year-old Indiana senator,
apparently changed few votes, the polls indicated.
   In the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll of 11,700 voters, with a
three-point margin of error, opinion was evenly divided on Reagan's
economic policies. Among those who thought they were doing better
than eight years ago, 84 percent backed Bush; of those doing worse,
80 percent backed Dukakis.
   ``This is very much an economic election. People are in fact
voting their pocketbooks,'' said Gawiser.
   By 50-44 percent, voters in the NBC-Journal poll said they wanted
the country to change rather than continue its course. Bush got 91
percent of those who opposed change; Dukakis got 82 percent of those
who favored change.

   Blacks picked up a long-coveted House seat in
New Jersey on Tuesday, but the elections brought no major gains for
minorities and women seeking to expand their influence in a Congress
dominated by white males.
   In the race for an open Senate seat in Wisconsin, state Senate
Minority Leader Susan Engeleiter was unable to wrest victory from
Democrat Herbert Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team,
although the race had tightened near the end.
   President Reagan campaigned for Mrs. Engeleiter in Wisconsin last
week. ``I believe the Senate could use a mother's perspective,'' he
said. Mrs. Engeleiter, the mother of two, would have been the only
female senator with growing children.
   The Wisconsin race was one of this year's most expensive, even
though the retiring incumbent, Democratic Sen. William Proxmire,
spent just $145.10 to win re-election in 1982.
   The other female candidate for the Senate, Republican Maria
Hustace, was easily outdistanced by Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.
   The only two incumbent women in the Senate, Nancy Landon
Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., were not up for
re-election this year.
   Black Republican candidates Alan Keyes of Maryland and Maurice
Dawkins of Virginia challenged popular white Democrats and lost by
wide margins, ensuring the Senate will be all white for at least
another two years.
   Throughout history, just three blacks have won election to the
Senate. The only one since Reconstruction was Edward Brooke, a
Massachusetts Republican who was defeated in 1978.
   In the House, all 23 female and 22 black incumbents were
re-elected, including the chamber's only black woman, Democrat
Cardiss Collins of Illinois, who was unopposed. A 23rd black, Walter
Fauntroy, the non-voting delegate to Congress from the District of
Columbia, was easily re-elected.
   The numbers of women and blacks were at their high-water marks in
the expiring Congress.
   Blacks picked up a seat in New Jersey, where two black men
competed to succeed Democratic Rep. Peter Rodino, a 40-year House
veteran and staunch civil rights supporter who was pressed to make
way for a black congressman in the minority-dominated district.
   Newark Councilman Donald Payne, a Democrat, handily defeated
Republican Michael Webb, a vocational education administrator, to
replace Rodino. The victor will be the state's first black member of
Congress.
   Among female incumbents, a first-term Democrat, Rep. Elizabeth
Patterson of South Carolina, held on to her seat despite stiff
competition from Republican Knox White, a Greenville attorney and
city councilman.
   Among female challengers, black attorney Faye Williams, a
Democrat, lost out in her repeat match in Louisiana against white
Rep. Clyde Holloway, a freshman Republican who outpolled her 51
percent to 49 percent in 1986. This time, Ms. Williams lost by a
57-43 margin.
   In a strong challenge to incumbency, Nita Lowey, a former New
York assistant secretary of state, was running slightly ahead of
two-term Republican Rep. Joseph DioGuardi but thousands of absentee
ballots remained to be counted. Lowey declared victory and retired
for the night, but DioGuardi refused to concede and admonished:
``Stick by me. We're not finished yet.''
   In Washington, Democratic state legislator Jolene Unsoeld was
running neck-and-neck with Republican Bill Wight to succeed Rep. Don
Bonker, who ran unsuccessfully in a Senate Democratic primary.
   In California's high-income Silicon Valley, Democrat Anna Eshoo,
a county supervisor, was trailing in a big-money battle with
Stanford law professor Tom Campbell, who beat GOP Rep. Ernest Konnyu
in the primary.
   Overall, there were 58 women _ 32 Democrats and 26 Republicans _
running as major-party candidates in 55 House districts this year,
and 35 blacks _ 26 Democrats and nine Republicans _ running in 31
districts.

<HEAD>From Corn, Carrots And Beans A State Supreme Court Blue Laws Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It started quietly with a few cans of sweet corn
illegally sold on Sunday. But before long, the contraband bought
from Cape Cod retailers grew to include carrots and green beans, and
the case wound up in Massachusetts' highest court.
   ``I knew which items to buy because I checked with the D.A.,''
state Trooper James Palth said with a wink.
   The case went before the Massachusetts Supreme Court on Tuesday.
   Several plainclothes officers, including Palth, caught a number
of retail stores in the act of violating the state's blue laws,
which were imposed by the Puritans about 1650 and restrict retail
sales on Sunday, the legislated day of rest.
   ``In some towns we found no violations, but some stores chose to
stay open and were taken to court,'' Palth said. Most violators
resolved the issue in district court by paying a $40 fine, he said.
   But the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., whose A&P stores
allegedly violated the blue laws, took exception to the code.
   ``A lot of people might want to buy their canned carrots on
Sunday and that's fine,'' said Thomas Yonce, assistant district
attorney in the Cape Cod city of Barnstable. ``Prosecutors in the
case were basically just looking for guidance from the highest court
in the state as to the meaning of the particular clause in
question.''
   At issue is the interpretation of a blue laws amendment, which
was adopted in 1982 and, A&P attorneys argue, liberalized
restrictions placed on Sunday retail sales.
   Attorneys for the supermarket chain maintain stores that are
authorized to sell one exempt item, such as a newspaper or film, are
authorized to sell any and all items without restriction.
   ``If that's the case, then anyone that sells film is now
exempt,'' Associate Justice Paul Liacos on Tuesday told attorney
Evan T. Lawson, who presented the defendants' briefs. ``Do you think
that's what the Legislature had in mind?''
   Attorneys agree the amendment is vague. It specifies only that
``any store or shop which qualifies for exemption under this clause
but does not qualify for exemption under any other clause in this
section shall not open for business on Sunday prior to the hour of
noon.''
   The Supreme Court took the matter under advisement, and plans to
issue a ruling later.
   The case puts the state in a win-win situation, Yonce said. ``The
commonwealth can't lose in this case,'' he said. ``It will clarify
the legal issues.''
   Attorney Eugene Richards, who helped prepare the case for law
firm Lawson & Wayne in Boston, said more was at stake for his client.
   ``It is humorous in a way, but it's an important issue to the A&P
in that it's a big service for the stores to be open on Sunday
morning, particularly in summer when people want to shop before
going to the beach,'' he said. ``They do a tremendous amount of
business in the mornings and on the weekends.''
   Lt. John Symington of the Dennis Police Department on the cape
said his officers were duty bound to enforce the law when they
received a complaint.
   However, Symington said that in at least one case retail
competitors tipped authorities off to the blue law violation.
   ``There's always been a great amount of controversy over the blue
laws,'' he said. ``Retail establishments feel they shouldn't be in
place. But I'd say it's a dangerous thing for police agencies to
determine what laws are or aren't going to be enforced based on
their perceived popularity.''

<DATELINE>PELOPI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a handful of people sat through the
night in a cafe in this mountain village that calls itself Michael
Dukakis' hometown, listening to news of the Democratic candidate's
defeat.
   Huddled in overcoats around a wood-burning stove in the
``Nukterida'' cafe, they drowned their disappointment in glasses of
ouzo and cognac as the radio broadcast results.
   Around dawn, when it became clear the Massachusetts governor had
lost his bid for the U.S. presidency, they decided to go home. A
Dukakis victory, the villagers believed, would have brought them
prosperity.
   ``I feel pretty gloomy,'' said one, Haralambos Maniatoglou.
   The 700-odd villagers, mostly sheep and goat breeders who make
around $1,500 a year, had pinned their hopes on a Dukakis presidency
to develop tourism in Pelopi.
   ``We're disappointed, we thought Michalis would make it. But I
hope (President-elect George) Bush doesn't take a grudge against
Greece for backing him,'' said Michalis Kamiris, vice president of
the village council.
   Dukakis' grandfather was born in Pelopi, on the northeastern
Aegean island of Mytilene, also known as Lesvos. The Democratic
candidate has been Michalis to the villagers ever sinceices, I always said
a prayer for our
Michalis. I dreamed of his electoral victory,'' said the Rev.
Giorgos Apostolou, who wore a ``Mike Dukakis-President'' button
pinned to his black robe.
   In Mytilene town, three second cousins who are Dukakis' closest
Greek relatives said they were disappointed but still proud.
   ``Michalis did everything he could. We're sorry he didn't win but
he still did well,'' said Patra Stefanidou, whose grandfather in
1913 arranged for Panos Dukakis, the governor's father, to emigrate
to the United States.
   Costas Stefanou, president of the Pelopi village council, said
the villagers' offer to Dukakis of a plot of land high up on the
mountains for a summer home still stands.
   He said plans for a hotel in Pelopi also would go ahead.
   ``We'll have to be glad he got as far as he did. Life goes on,
and he's still the story of our village,'' Stefanou said.

<HEAD>Democrats Expand House Control; Voters Turn Out Incumbents Under

   Democrats rode a tidal wave of incumbent
victories to renewed control of the House of Representatives Tuesday
as voters turned out a Democratic chairman dogged by ethical
controversy and a two-term Republican under indictment.
   By early morning, Democrats appeared likely to pad their 257-178
margin of control, perhaps by as many as four seats. A
record-breaking 99 percent of incumbents were re-elected or leading,
compared to 98 percent in 1986.
   A total of 396 incumbents had won and seven were leading. Only
two incumbents were trailing their challengers and only three had
lost.
   By early morning, the Democrats had won 254 seats and were
leading for another seven. The Republicans had won 170 and led for
four. But in a couple of undecided races, the leads were razor thin.
   The apparent Democratic gain in the face of the broad victory by
Republican presidential nominee George Bush marked the first time in
28 years that the party that won the White House lost House seats.
In 1960, John F. Kennedy became president but the Democrats lost 20
seats.
   Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House Banking
Committee, was buried in his bid for a 15th term by political novice
Ronald Machtley, a lawyer. St Germain, down 44-56 percent with all
votes counted, was the first committee chairman to lose since 1980,
when Oregon voters turned out House Ways and Means Chairman Al
Ullman.
   Justice Department documents unsealed late last month said a
department investigation had uncovered ``substantial evidence of
serious and sustained misconduct'' in St Germain's dealings with
financial industry lobbyists. The department's criminal division
declined to prosecute but referred its findings last May to the
House ethics committee, which has not said how it is handling the
matter.
   In Georgia, former actor Ben Jones, a Democrat, defeated two-term
Republican Rep. Pat Swindall in a bitter rematch in their suburban
Atlanta district. Jones, a recovered alcoholic, played ``Cooter'' on
the TV series ``Dukes of Hazzard.'' Swindall is fighting perjury
charges stemming from a drug money laundering probe. With 89 percent
of the vote counted, Jones led 61-39 percent.
   The third incumbent who lost, in another hard-fought rematch, was
Rep. Mac Sweeney, R-Texas. His 1986 opponent, Democratic attorney
Greg Laughlin, held a 53-47 percent lead with more than 90 percent
of the vote counted.
   Four-term Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., was trailing Democratic state
Rep. Mike Kopetski in the Salem area in another tight race testing
the power of incumbency. Kopetski held a 51-49 percent lead with
two-thirds of the vote tallied.
   There were only 27 districts this year in which no incumbent was
running _ 12 of them held by Democrats and 15 by Republicans during
the past Congress.
   Democrats picked up one open seat previously held by a
Republican, and the GOP picked up a formerly Democratic open seat in
Florida.
   In Nebraska, Democrat Peter Hoagland, a former state senator,
defeated Republican Jerry Schenken, a pathologist, in the Omaha
district formerly represented by Hal Daub. In Florida, Republican
Cliff Stearns, a motel executive, defeated State House Speaker Jon
Mills in the Gainesville district formerly represented by Buddy
MacKay, a Senate candidate.
   And in the Texas district vacated by unsuccessful GOP Senate
candidate Beau Boulter, Democratic state Sen. Bill Sarpalius was
leading Republican Larry Milner, president of the Amarillo Chamber
of Commerce.
   Ethical problems colored a number of House races.
   Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., whose administrative assistant committed
suicide this year after revelations about his treatment of male
staff aides, won a narrow victory over Republican Wayne Gilchrest.
Dyson was also scrutinized in connection with a probe of Pentagon
procurement fraud but has denied any wrongoing. With 99 percent of
the vote counted, Dyson had a lead of about 1,500 votes.
   Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., another member whose name came up in
connection with the ongoing Pentagon investigation, was also locked
in a close race. Chappell has denied any wrongdoing and no charges
have been filed. With all but absentee votes counted, he was leading
Republican attorney Craig James by 1,800 votes out of 231,000
tabulated.
   But Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn., coasted to an easy victory in
Memphis despite having been indicted last year for bank fraud, mail
fraud and conspiracy. He is awaiting trial.
   Assessing the outcome, Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the renewed
Democratic majority signaled public approval of the party's
congressional agenda. ``They gave us their vote of confidence,'' he
said. ``The future of the country will be guided by Democrats in the
House and Senate.''
   But House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., maintained that
``it's still the presidential race means more than anything.''
Michel handily defeated labor lawyer Douglas Stephens, who came
within 6,125 votes of defeating him six years ago.
   Black House members increased their number by one, to 23, with
the re-election of all 22 incumbents and the victory of Democrat
Donald Payne, a Newark, N.J., city councilman, in the district
represented by retiring Rep. Peter Rodino.
   All 23 women in the House won re-election. The victors included
two freshmen once thought to be at risk _ Reps. Connie Morella,
R-Md., and Liz Patterson, D-S.C. Incremental gains were possible.
   Democrat Jolene Unsoeld was locked in a see-saw battle for an
open, formerly Democratic seat in Seattle. Unsoeld led Republican
Bill Wight, a former Senate aide, by about 1,600 votes out of
173,000 tallied.
   And Democrat Nita Lowey was leading by about 2,300 votes in her
bid to unseat two-term Rep. Joseph DioGuardi of Westchester County,
north of New York City. With several thousand absentee ballots
uncounted, Lowey declared victory but DioGuardi refused to concede.
   Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., who won re-election in 1986 by 47 votes,
more comfortably defeated the same opponent _ Democratic lawyer Tom
Ward _ this year. Rep. Clyde Holloway, R-La., won a rematch against
Democrat Faye Williams. Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., again fended off
populist farmer Wayne Cryts.

   California voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly
rejected an emotionally charged AIDS initiative which would have
forced doctors to report AIDS patients and required health
professionals to trace others who might have infected.
   But a second AIDS measure, Proposition 96, was approved by voters
by 63.6 percent to 36.4 percent margin. It will allow AIDS testing
of people arrested for certain crimes.
   The approved measure was designed by Los Angeles County Sheriff
Sherman Block to help protect rape victims and law enforcement
officials who fear they may have been exposed to AIDS or other
communicable diseases.
   ``I think the voters have rejected the introduction of politics
into public health in California,'' said Dr. Michael Gottlieb, an
AIDS research pioneer who resigned from Gov. George Deukmeijian's
AIDs commission after the governor backed Proposition 102.
   With 39.3 percent of precincts reporting, Proposition 102, whose
main supporter was former tax rebel Paul Gann who is now suffering
from AIDS, failed by 63.9 percent to 36.1 percent.
   Homosexuals expressed disappointment at the success of 96, and
peaceful marches were staged both in San Francisco and in Los
Angeles. About 1,500 homosexuals and supporters marched to the State
Building near San Francisco City Hall and about 30 people marched in
the West Hollywood area.
   Susan Jester, Southern California campaign manager of the No on
102 campaign, credited a coalition of gay groups and medical
professionals for the proposition's defeat.
   ``Once again the voters of California have said no to an
initiative that was mean-spirited and ill-advised and have given the
California Medical Association and AIDS researchers their vote of
confidence,'' she said.
   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Fullerton, sponsor of Proposition 102,
said, ``The cornerstone of being able to deal with an epidemic is
reportability in confidence to public health authorities.''
   He said he would press for adoption of a similar policy next
year. He did not say what form his move would take.

<TEXT>
   Scot Ebbinghaus knew he wanted to be a
doctor when he graduated from high school in 1982, but he hoped to
begin his medical education immediately rather than spend four years
at a liberal arts college.
   Ebbinghaus applied to University of Missouri-Kansas City's School
of Medicine, whose concentrated program turns freshmen into
physicians in just six years.
   ``The school gave me the ideal opportunity to get right into
medicine,'' he said recently. ``And I liked the idea of not having
to reapply for medical school after four years in college.''
   The school has been attracting students like Ebbinghaus since
1971, when Dr. E. Grey Dimond organized a program that still is
considered significantly different from typical medical education.
   ``I felt from the beginning that the country needed a different
approach to training our doctors,'' Dimond said. ``I think our
program anticipated some of the problems that are being discussed
today. Our results, our students, have shown this program can work.''
   Today there are about 25 six-year medical schools in the United
States.
   Missouri-Kansas City differs from most by giving students
clinical experience early _ in the first week of classes _ and in
its so-called docent system.
   Students are organized into small groups with a permanently
assigned physician-teacher called a docent. Each docent is assigned
12 students and follows them throughout their educations.
   Docent teams make rounds together for two months of each of the
last four years. Fifth- and sixth-year students within the groups
are assigned third- and fourth-year students as partners.
   Ebbinghaus, a sixth-year student, has been paired with third-year
student Barbara Bumberry.
   ``It is nice to have one central figure who can be an adviser and
a role model,'' she said. ``And having Scot as a partner helps
because it hasn't been that long since he's been in my shoes.
Sometimes it's easier to talk to someone closer to your age.''
   Students in the program learn a way of life, not just medical
facts, said Dr. Stephen Hamburger, assistant dean of the medical
school and chairman of the department of medicine.
   ``Much of medical knowledge changes about every five years,'' he
said. ``So we try to integrate the factual knowledge with a personal
sense of being a good doctor, of knowing how to be a problem solver
and how to best help a patient.''
   In order to earn a bachelor of arts degree and a medical degree
in six years, students attend classes 11 months each year and have
some classes on Saturday.
   ``We were not trying to create a lightweight, quick school,''
Dimond said. ``The 11 months was a deliberate decision. It's one way
to get medicine into their bones. It helps them mature, rather than
letting them spin off into summer ennui every year.''
   In the past five years, the school has averaged about 450
applicants. It accepts 100 students every year, based on class rank,
standardized test scores, extracurricular activities and interviews
with a physician and a lay person.
   About 82.5 percent of the students graduate, and all pass their
National Board of Medical Examiners examinations, the school said.
   ``We have been rich with brilliant students,'' said Dimond. ``But
we can't objectively measure our success yet. We want them to become
leaders among physicians. That is still down the road a little, but
we think that goal will be reached.''

<HEAD>Government Wants $1 Million Bail Revoked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lawyer accused of leading a Colombian drug
cartel's U.S. operations could easily flee and live abroad, a
prosecutor said in asking that the man's $1 million bail be revoked.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Lyons said Tuesday that J.T. Prada
might have used Panamanian banks to stash some of the millions of
dollars he is accused of making through the Medellin cartel.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson took the no-bail request
under consideration. He said that before ruling he would listen to
tapes of conversations in which two co-defendants and an undercover
drug agent discuss Prada's activities.
   Prada was one of 21 people named in a federal indictment issued
Oct. 19 in connection with a cocaine ring authorities said imported
as much as a ton of cocaine into the United States per month.
   He is charged with conspiracy to distribute and conspiracy to
import cocaine. The defendants are from San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Miami, New York and Phoenix.
   Prada's bail originally was set at $350,000, then raised to $1
million.
   Lyons sait that, according to the taped conversations, Prada
received a $2 million annual salary from the cartel and worked to
lower bail for eight Colombians arrested on drug charges, then
helped them escape to South America on flights he arranged.
   In one conversation, Lyons said, Prada talked about buying planes
``under the table'' to import cocaine. In another, a co-defendant
allegedly said Prada had worked five years for the cartel and its
chieftain, Colombian soccer team owner and co-defendant Jose
Rodriguez-Gacha, who is a fugitive.
   Co-defendant Paul Eugene Smith, a private investigator who
sometimes worked for Prada, also is reported to say on a tape that
Prada had stashed some of his drug earnings in Panamanian banks.
   Defense attorney Michael Abzug criticized the government for not
presenting any documentation, such as Panamanian bank records, to
support their claims.

   The Soviet Union said today that it expected to be
able to work for peace and disarmament with George Bush, who it
characterized as a close follower of President Reagan.
   The official news agency Tass reported in a brief dispatch early
today that Bush had won Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.
   In a later broadcast, official Radio Moscow said: ``The Soviet
Union proceeds from the understanding that a dialogue between the
two countries will be continued with a new administration in the
interests of nuclear disarmament and world peace.''
   It said observers noted that the election of Bush was decided
``first and foremost by the improvement in the national economy
which took place lately under the present administration, a
reduction of inflation and the number of jobless.''
   Radio Moscow said Bush had promised during the campaign to follow
Reagan's course in both domestic and foreign policy, including
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Improving superpower relations helped Bush, but so did his
promise of a strong America, the radio report said. In contrast, it
said, Democrat Michael Dukakis was portrayed as a liberal who was
weak on foreign policy issues.
   The Soviet media had not expressed a preference for either
candidate.
   ``We prefer the winner,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov told a briefing last week.
   He said the Soviets would like a prompt summit meeting with the
next U.S. president, something observers in Washington say Bush
would like as well.
   The two sides reached agreement on a treaty to eliminate both
superpowers' intermediate-range nuclear missiles, but talks have
slowed considerably as the Reagan administration comes to a close
and the U.S. focus turned to selecting his replacement.

   Voters in Michigan, Arkansas and Colorado dealt a
blow to pro-choice forces by overwhelmingly approving bans on
tax-financed abortions for poor women.
   Prior to Tuesday's election, pro-choice advocates had lost only
one of 22 referendums around the country.
   In Michigan, the measure banning state-funded abortions won by a
60-40 margin, with 36 percent of the vote counted early today.
   Anti-abortion and pro-choice forces waged an intense struggle
over the proposal, which ends the expenditure of $5.8 million a year
for about 18,600 abortions for low-income women. Passage of the
measure makes Michigan the 37th state to refuse to pay for the
procedures.
   Barbara Listing, chairwoman of the Committee to End Tax-Funded
Abortions, said the vote showed Michigan voters' ``commitment to the
unborn child.''
   ``The victory is truly a grass roots victory. The people in the
communities have won despite opposition from the (Gov. James)
Blanchard administration and despite the opposition from the
abortion industry both here in Michigan and also nationwide,'' she
said.
   Coloradans endorsed a ban on state funding of abortion by nearly
a 2-1 margin.
   In a much closer vote, Arkansas voters approved a similar
amendment, which also established as state policy the protection of
unborn children. The state's voters had turned down a similar ballot
issue in 1986 by just 519 votes.
   ``We're elated,'' said Rob Shafer of the Unborn Child Amendment
Committee, one of the measure's chief authors. ``There is no way to
measure the sacrifices made, the personal sacrifice of time to
circulate petitions. It was a grassroots effort. We didn't have the
budget. We relied on our supporters.''
   With 95 percent of the precincts reporting, the vote for the
amendment was 382,161, or 52 percent, to 354,926, or 48 percent.
   Pro-choice forces in Michigan refused to concede defeat early
today, but an official of one national group watching the vote said
low-income women will suffer.
   ``In essence, it's tough on poor women and it's tragic,'' said
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority.
   ``We're going to come back. We're not going to desert poor women.
We're going to keep fighting until we have choice for all classes,''
Smeal said.

Challenge</HEAD>

   His resume crowned with an unsurpassing entry,
George Bush now confronts the challenge of matching it with
performance as 41st President of the United States.
   After a bitter campaign, the president-elect must take command of
a divided government so burdened with debt that options are scarce,
with a long agenda of problems that cannot wait, and with little
guidance from the voters because they seldom were consulted on the
issues of governing.
   And Bush, the multi-job Republican appointee who became an
eight-year understudy, must prove that his resume of government jobs
has prepared him for the presidency as President Reagan said it had.
For the first time since he left Congress 18 years ago, Bush is
beholden to no boss except the voters. He hasn't told them a lot
about what he intends to do, but he must tell them soon.
   Symbolism, slogans and lip readings won't suffice. They belong to
a campaign that never did turn kinder, gentler or very instructive
about either candidate's blueprint for the future.
   Bush won a hefty majority of Tuesday's popular vote, and that
translated into an electoral vote landslide. With it, he overcame
what he'd jokingly called the curse of Martin Van Buren, the last
sitting vice president elected president, 152 years ago.
   Bush captured about 54 percent of the popular vote, and 426 of
the 538 electoral votes that actually elect a president.
   Conceding defeat in Boston, Gov. Michael Dukakis promised to
cooperate with Bush. ``This nation faces major challenges ahead and
we must work together,'' he said. At the same time, he noted
pointedly that Congress remained solidly Democratic, on both sides
of the Capitol.
   Bush is well aware of that. ``I'll do my level best to reach out
and work constructively with the United States Congress,'' he said.
   He'll have to do without the kind of political clout Reagan
carried during his first term. Reagan's 1980 election helped fashion
Republican gains in Congress _ and produced a GOP Senate majority
that lasted six years. Bush showed no such coattails. While his
Republican ticket was winning, the Democrats were strengthening
their congressional majorities a bit.
   Clearly, the first mission for the president-elect was to bury
the hatchet he'd been using on Dukakis all fall, in a campaign that
concentrated on negatives _ on showing that the other candidate
didn't deserve the job.
   Democratic grudges won't be forgotten soon, so the Bush
peacemaking effort is not going to be easy. He wasted no time in
getting started. His election-night celebration was a rally with a
sermon.
   ``A campaign is a disagreement and disagreements divide,'' he
told supporters in Houston. ``But an election is a decision and
decisions clear the way for harmony and peace. And I mean to be
president of all the people.''
   He said he would seek to be worthy of the trust of his supporters
and to earn the trust of his opponents. ``My hand is out to you,''
he said. ``I want to be your president, too.''
   The policy proposals so lacking in the campaign fare will have to
follow quickly. Bush must fill in the blanks in his oxymoronic
``flexible freeze'' of the federal budget. He still has some
persuading to do to convince even Republicans that the deficit can
be curbed with _ ``read my lips'' _ no new taxes.
   One campaign specific was his call for a cut in the capital gains
tax which Dukakis denounced as a tax break for the rich. Bush said
it would spur investment and create jobs. Now he will have to make
that case to Congress and, in particular, to Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
of the Senate Finance Committee. While losing as Democratic vice
presidential nominee, Bentsen was overwhelmingly re-elected to the
Senate in Texas.
   Candidate Bush promised to maintain the foreign policy and
economic achievements he credited to Reagan's leadership. Reagan
said the new GOP administration has a mandate to ``continue the
changes that create jobs, prosperity and peace for all Americans.''
   President-elect Bush must define the changes he will indeed
continue _ and those he will change.

   Americans stayed away from the polls in droves
again this year, probably pushing voter turnout levels below that of
the 1948 election when 51.1 percent of eligible voters cast ballots,
preliminary figures showed today.
   Voter turnout could even dip below the 50 percent mark, said
Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and public policy
organization.
   Gans predicted turnout would end up between the level of the 1948
election and the low reached in the 1924 election, pegged at around
48 percent to 49 percent.
   ``We had a horrible election in a variety of ways ... and the
people responded accordingly,'' he said. ``There are a combination
of factors, like people feeling their vote doesn't make a
difference, a declining allegiance to (political) parties, and the
conduct and coverage of the campaign.''
   Gans based his preliminary prediction on analysis of 29 states
and the District of Columbia that by early Wednesday had 90 percent
or more precincts reporting.
   ``With the exception of possibly Mississippi and New Hampshire,
which may equal their turnout in 1984 but not substantially exceed
it, in every other state and the District of Columbia turnout is
down, and sharply in some,'' he said.
   Gans said it was unclear whether the television networks' early
calls of the election had any effect on turnout in Western states.
   CBS, the first network to proclaim Bush the winner, called the
race at 9:17 p.m. EST, an hour and 43 minutes before polls closed on
the West Coast. Gans noted that in 1984 and 1980, the networks
called the race two-and-a-half to three hours before the polls
closed in the West.
   Gans said the apparent decline broadly reflected voting patterns
of the past three decades.
   ``We've had a sliding turnout since 1960, with the exception of a
slight uptick in 1984,'' he said.
   Turnout was 53.1 percent in the last presidential election,
slightly up from the 52.6 percent in 1980 after steadily declining
since 1948, the year of Harry S. Truman's upset victory over Thomas
E. Dewey.
   ``We've had nothing but negative elections since 1964 on the
presidential level,'' he said. Americans went to the polls to vote
against the Vietnam War, against Watergate and against Jimmy Carter,
among other things, he said.
   He said voters are also turned off by images of government
officials being sent off to jail and by television coverage that
makes people spectators to politics instead of participants.
   ``I've seen people turn out in high numbers'' in a few isolated
races in recent years, ``and they all had something in common,'' he
said. ``People will vote when they have something to vote about,
when there's something important to decide.
   ``But increasingly ... nonvoting is becoming a rational act, and
a response and protest to the politics they see.''

   Pollsters said voters cited their belief that the economy was
doing well as the major reason they opted to continue Republican
control of the White House.
   ``This is very much an economic election,'' said NBC News
pollster Sheldon Gawiser. ``People are in fact voting their
pocketbooks.''
   Bush worked off a solid Southern base and picked off several of
the Northern industrial states essential to Dukakis' dream of an
upset.
   When Ohio, Michigan, and New Jersey fell into the Republican
column, it was apparent that Bush was headed for victory. Then he
scored a narrow victory in Pennsylvania, once considered part of the
Democratic base, and closed with a narrow win in California.
   Pickings were slim for Dukakis. He carried his home state of
Massachusetts and the solidly Democratic District of Columbia. Then
Rhode Island, New York, Minnesota, Iowa, West Virginia, Wisconsin,
Oregon, Washington and Hawaii voted for him.
   Twelve states elected governors and Democrats replaced
Republicans in Indiana and West Virginia. In Montana, the Republican
was leading in the race to succeed Democratic Gov. Ted Schwinden,
who did not seek re-election.
   Two other Republican Senate losers were David Karnes of Nebraska
who was trounced by former Gov. Bob Kerrey and Chic Hecht of Nevada,
defeated by Gov. Richard Bryan.
   Former Democratic Gov. Charles Robb of Virginia easily defeated
Republican Maurice Dawkins in a race for the seat being vacated by
Republican Paul Trible.
   Republican Rep. Trent Lott won the seat of retiring Democratic
Sen. John Stennis of Mississippi; that Deep South state will have
two Republican senators for the first time in this century.
   House seats proved safe for incumbents with 99 percent winning
new terms.
   The most prominent loser was Banking Committee Chairman Fernand
St Germain, D-R.I., whose bid for a 15th term was shaken by
disclosure of a Justice Department document which cited
``substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct'' in the
congressman's dealings with financial industry lobbyists.
   Another loser was two-term Georgia Republican Pat Swindall who
was under indictment for perjury. He lost to Democrat Ben Jones, a
recovered alcoholic, who played ``Cooter'' in the television series
``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   Despite a $4 million campaign by the National Rifle Association,
Maryland voters overwhelmingly endorsed a law banning cheap handguns.
   Voters in Michigan and Colorado approved measures banning use of
state funds for abortions. Massachusetts voters rejected a proposal
that would have shut down the state's two nuclear power plants.
   Bush's victory culminated a quest that began in 1979. Early in
1980, he upset favored Reagan in the Iowa caucuses only to be
crushed a month later in the New Hampshire primary.
   Bush was Reagan's 11th hour choice for a running mate. The GOP
victory over incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter placed Bush
firmly in the shadow of one of the nation's most popular presidents
for the next eight years.
   Giving Reagan total loyalty, the vice president won his boss's
gratitude and the grudging support of many conservatives. Holdouts
on the Republican right looked for alternative candidates for the
presidential nomination, but when the battle was joined in 1988 none
could overcome Bush's identification with Reagan.
   ``I felt like I was running against Reagan,'' complained Dole
after a series of primary election defeats earlier this year.
   The son of an investment banker from Greenwich, Conn., Bush was
derided early in the campaign as a wimp and as a politician with no
vision of his own. But he underwent a remarkable transformation at
the Republican convention.
   After trailing Dukakis in the polls early in the summer, Bush
went on the attack and by Labor Day the race had changed
dramatically. The Democratic candidate paid a heavy political price
for refusing to respond to the attacks on his record on crime and
the environment as well as on his patriotism.
   By the time Dukakis shifted his tactics, it was too late and Bush
was on his way to victory.

<TEXT>
   Kingman Brewster Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to
Britain who as Yale University president led a school demonstration
against the Vietnam war in Washington and launched a black studies
program, has died at age 69.
   Brewster died Tuesday of a brain hemorrhage at an Oxford
hospital, U.S. Embassy officials said.
   Since 1986, he had been master of University College, which dates
from the 13th century and is Oxford University's oldest college.
   Brewster, a lawyer and former Harvard University law professor,
was appointed by former President Jimmy Carter as ambassador to the
Court of James's in 1977 and held the post until 1981.
   The Times of London said in an obituary today: ``Brewster ... was
an Anglophile and ... was much admired by those with whom he came
into contact for his perceptive analysis of the British political
and social scene.''
   Born in Longmeadow, Mass., on June 17, 1919, Brewster graduated
from Yale in 1941 and received a law degree from Harvard University
in 1948.
   He was a professor of law at Harvard from 1950 to 1960, was Yale
provost from 1961 to 1963 and was president of Yale from 1963 to
1977 during a period of upheaval in many American universities.
   ``Kingman Brewster was the pre-eminent university president of
his day _ a man who stood for equity as well as excellence, change
as well as continuity, and understanding as well as courage,'' said
Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. ``Yale will ever be a better
institution because of his spirited leadership.''
   During Brewster's tenure at Yale, the university admitted more
women and more minorities and started a department of black studies.
Brewster opposed the war in Vietnam and led a Yale anti-war
demonstration in Washington.
   Brewster's ancestor William Brewster sailed to what is now
Plymouth, Mass., aboard the Mayflower in 1620, vowing with 100 other
fellow-pilgrims to recover the religious freedoms they began losing
in the England of Queen Elizabeth I.
   During his ambassadorship, Brewster received 11 honorary degrees
from British universities.
   Daniel Cunningham, a former Senior Fellow at University College,
said Brewster had not been well since taking the post at Oxford.
   ``We feel absolutely shattered by his death because he was such a
good Fellow. We shall miss him greatly both as a colleague and as a
close personal friend,'' Cunningham said.
   Asked if he believed there was a special relationship between
Britain and the United States, Brewster was quoted as saying, ``I
think it's very real.
   ``Each country has a stake in the success of the other in solving
its problems. They share with Canada, Australia and New Zealand a
devotion to the art of balancing freedom and order. ... Between the
two countries there is a very special spiritual or ideological
dependence.''
   Brewster is survived by his wife, the former Mary Louise
Phillips, three sons and two daughters. Funeral arrangements were
incomplete.

   With ``a full heart and great hopes,'' George Herbert Walker Bush
today claimed a presidential mandate from American voters who
tempered his triumph by strengthening the Democratic opposition's
control of Congress.
   After a campaign in which many voters expressed dismay over their
choice between Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, the
president-elect vowed to work for the respect of those who opposed
him and moved to spell out some of his plans for his presidency.
   He planned a news conference today in Houston and then a trip to
Washington to talk over the election _ and the future _ with Ronald
Reagan in the Oval Office.
   Bush won the election easily _ the third straight convincing
Republican presidential victory _ but he fell short of the 49-state
sweep by Ronald Reagan four years ago.
   That was little consolation for the Democrats who now have lost
five of the last six presidential elections.
   ``He will be our president and we'll work with him,'' Dukakis
said Tuesday night in a gracious yet unbowed concession speech.
   ``God knows, there's lots of work to do,'' said the Republican
president-elect, looking ahead to next January when he will succeed
Reagan after eight years as loyal understudy.
   ``The people have spoken,'' he told cheering supporters in
Houston. ``And with a full heart and with great hopes, I thank all
of the people throughout America who have given us this great
victory. ... To those who supported me, I will try to be worthy of
your trust. And to those that did not, I will try to earn it.''
   Bush became the first sitting vice president to win the
presidency since Democrat Martin Van Buren in 1836. An ominous note
for Bush: Van Buren was defeated for re-election.
   According to surveys of voters as they left polling places, a big
factor working for Bush was the continued popularity of his boss.
   Speculation was that Bush campaign chairman and former Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III would be the next secretary of state
and that current treasury secretary Nicholas Brady, a Bush
confidant, would remain in his Cabinet job.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos also are good bets to keep their posts in a Bush
administration.
   Dukakis closed out his campaign with an exhausting 48-hour race
from state to state with no break for sleep. All the same, he was
out power-walking on Election Day and when he appeared before
supporters for his concession speech they chanted, ``92, 92, 92,
92.''
   The weary candidate looked not quite ready to plunge into the
next presidential campaign.
   In the popular vote, with 93 percent of the precincts reporting,
Bush had 44,539,772 or 54 percent. Dukakis had 37,957,059 or 46
percent.
   In the critical tally of electoral votes, Bush won 40 states for
426 electoral votes. Dukakis won 10 states and the District of
Columbia for 112 electoral votes.
   But Democrats were padding their advantages in both houses of
Congress _ by two seats in the Senate for a 56-44 edge, and with a
likely pickup of four more in the House for a 261-174 advantage
there.
   Not all the storm clouds for the 41st president formed in the
opposition ranks.
   Republican Senate leader Bob Dole of Kansas lost no time chiding
Bush for not campaigning more for GOP Senate candidates.
   ``We could have used a little help from the vice president in
some of those states,'' said Dole, who waged a bitter fight with
Bush last winter for the Republican presidential nomination.
   Hard-line conservatives also were already demanding that Bush
replace Thornburgh, too moderate for their tastes.
   Two veteran senators lost their seats _ Republican Lowell Weicker
Jr. of Connecticut and Democrat John Melcher of Montana.
   Weicker, a maverick to the end, refused to concede to Democrat
Joseph Lieberman and a recount appeared likely. Lieberman's margin
in the unofficial count was 4,897 votes out of more than 1.3 million
cast.
   Melcher was defeated by Republican Conrad Burns, a former farm
broadcaster.
   Bush and Dukakis ended their campaign, noteworthy for its
bitterness, with words of conciliation and cooperation.
   Bush said he had received a call from Dukakis ``and I want you to
know he was most gracious. His call was personal, it was genuinely
friendly and it was in the great tradition of American politics.''
   Dukakis also referred to the conversation and told his
supporters, ``This nation faces major challenges ahead and we must
work together.''
   The Massachusetts governor's running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas, easily won re-election to the Senate seat from the Lone Star
state.
   Bentsen said he and Dukakis ``waged a campaign that's worthy of
the American people. ... We fought fair and we never quit.''
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle told supporters in Washington
that ``you need never question the devotion and dedication I will
bring to this job.''
   Bush's selection of the Indiana senator as his running mate was
one of the most controversial acts of the campaign and one that many
observers thought would cost the Republicans votes. But polls showed
the Quayle factor had little impact on the results.

   Mike Larimer, whose house is full of snakes
and other unusual pets, is the first to admit he doesn't view the
slithery serpents the way most folks do.
   ``There's a lot of people who just don't understand snakes,''
Larimer said. ``It really bothers me. They do a lot of good. They
kill a lot of rats and spiders and keep the rabbit population under
control, too.''
   He has plenty of chances to see snakes up close at home. Some
stay coiled up in tanks and cages. Sheba, a 50-pound python, has her
own room.
   ``Sheba's a little too big for a cage,'' Larimer said during a
recent interview at his home.
   Larimer's 10-foot prize pet could grow three times as long if she
eats enough of the live rabbits he keeps around for snake food.
   ``I'm really proud of her,'' Larimer said.
   In addition to the snakes, Larimer has a neon-green iguana named
Charlie, a tarantula dubbed Octy II, a pair of piranhas and some
frogs.
   ``Everything I've got but Charlie and my python came from the
woods,'' he said. ``Why buy it from the pet store when you can get
it for free? It's a lot more fun that way, too.''
   Larimer likes other animals, but says there's something special
about a scaly pet that slithers and hisses instead of barking all
night.
   ``Once you get over your fear of them, they make just as good a
pet as a cat or a dog,'' he said. ``They're a lot more interesting
to watch. They make nifty knots.''

   A three-legged cat dubbed Tripod
after its rescue from a drain pipe last month has a new home and a
new name.
   Connie Moon, one of 15 people who helped rescue the animal Oct.
22 after a leg got caught in a trap, adopted the cat last week and
renamed it Bandit.
   Mrs. Moon's sister, Amy, started the cat rescue effort when she
spotted the feline walking down a street, dragging the leg trap.
   Amy Moon said Monday that she tried to follow thet cat to see if
she could help it, but the animal darted away. Others joined in the
search for the hurt cat, including a police officer, three
firefighters, a humane society official and the Moon sisters.
   Connie Moon adopted the cat from the South Wood County Humane
Society, which cared for the animal and arranged for the amputation
of the right front leg injured by the trap.
   She said Bandit appears to be getting along with her other cat,
Precious.
   ``They didn't like each other at first, and hissed at each
other,'' Mrs. Moon said. ``But now they`re drinking out of the same
bowl.''

   Western Michigan University, recognizing
that mom no longer asks you if you've done your homework once you're
on campus, has found a way to help bewildered freshmen make the
transition to college life.
   The course in the basics of higher education is called University
101.
   The course teaches students skills such as studying, taking tests
and behaving in class, and provides emotional support. More than 350
students enrolled this fall.
   Dropout rates at Western Michigan have dropped from about 30
percent to 21 percent since the course was introduced four years
ago, said Susan B. Hannah, assistant vice president for academic
affairs.
   ``Clearly it works,'' she said. ``It's been proven. Giving
students an introduction to the skills they will need to survive in
college improves the chances that they'll continue past their
freshman year.''
   Hannah said many of incoming freshmen are ill-prepared. ``I'm not
proud of it, but that's life _ and we have to deal with the
customers who walk across our campus.''

<HEAD>Minorities, Women Look For Incremental Gains In Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks picked up one House seat and
congresswomen at least held their ground on Election Day but both
groups failed to bolster their ranks in the all-white, mostly male
Senate.
   New Jersey elected its first black congressman and all 22
incumbent blacks were returned to the House, bringing the total to
23 for the next Congress. All are Democrats.
   All 23 female House members were re-elected, as well, and women
were ahead in the race for an open seat in Washington and possibly
ousted an incumbent male in New York.
   Victory eluded the two women and two blacks who sought to join
the Senate, meaning the chamber will remain all white and hold
steady at just two female members.
   Feminist leader Eleanor Smeal blamed the slow progress on a
political system that is weighted in favor of incumbents.
   ``It's locking out women and blacks,'' she said. ``We've got to
do something about the rules. These are incumbent protection clubs
the way the rules are working.''
   The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Mervyn
Dymally, D-Calif., said the results for blacks were ``not
encouraging at all'' despite the slight gain on Tuesday.
   ``The problem is this: blacks vote for whites in large numbers in
the South but whites do not vote for blacks,'' said Dymally.
   It was a vacancy in Washington's House delegation where
Democratic state legislator Jolene Unsoeld sought victory. She was
leading Republican Bill Wight in the race to succeed Rep. Don
Bonker, who ran unsuccessfully in a Senate Democratic primary.
   And in a strong challenge to incumbency, Nita Lowey, a former New
York assistant secretary of state, was ahead of two-term Republican
Rep. Joseph DioGuardi with thousands of absentee ballots yet to be
counted.
   Lowey declared victory and retired for the night, but DioGuardi
refused to concede and admonished: ``Stick by me. We're not finished
yet.''
   Women were trailing in two other close races. Democrat Anna Eshoo
was losing to Republican Tom Campbell in California's Silicon
Valley, and Democrat Lana Pollack was behind Rep. Carl Pursell,
R-Mich.
   The best hope for adding another woman to the Senate had been
Wisconsin state Senate Minority Leader Susan Engeleiter, a
Republican. She was unable to catch Democrat Herbert Kohl, owner of
the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, although the race narrowed at
the end.
   The other female candidate for the Senate, Republican Maria
Hustace, was easily defeated by Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii.
   The two incumbent women in the Senate _ Nancy Landon Kassebaum,
R-Kan., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. _ were not up for re-election.
   In New Jersey, two blacks had competed to succeed Rep. Peter
Rodino, a 40-year House veteran and staunch civil rights supporter
who was pressed to make way for a black congressman in the
minority-dominated district.
   ``I believe this will make all of the people feel ... part of
this great nation,'' said Newark councilman Donald Payne, who
defeated Republican Michael Webb. ``The House of Representatives
should be truly representative.''
   The only other district where blacks had a good shot at picking
up a seat was in Louisiana, where black attorney Faye Williams
fought a losing rematch with first-term Rep. Clyde Holloway, a white
Republican. Ms. Williams lost by a 57-43 margin this time, compared
to a 51-49 defeat two years ago.
   Linda Williams, a political analyst at the Joint Center for
Political Studies, which focuses on black political affairs, said
future gains for blacks will be hard to come by, since most
black-dominated districts now have black congressmen.
   ``It's going to be slow as a tortoise for a good while to come,''
she said. ``It really comes down to (blacks) winning a lot of white
votes.''
   The last black to serve in the Senate was Edward Brooke, a
Massachusetts Republican who was defeated in 1978.
   Overall, there were 58 women _ 32 Democrats and 25 Republicans _
running as major-party candidates in 55 House districts this year,
and 35 blacks _ 26 Democrats and nine Republicans _ running in 31
districts.
   Also re-elected was Walter Fauntroy, a black who is the
non-voting delegate to Congress from the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Dollar Moves Lower In Europe, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved lower in Europe this morning as
the market digested the victory of George Bush in the U.S.
presidential election.
   Gold prices rose slightly.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Italy said they expected traders to
test the dollar's lower ranges today, as Bush's victory underlined
what they saw as voters' lack of enthusiasm for the new president.
   One trader in Milan with a U.S. commercial bank predicted that
the dollar will continue to fall through November, unless Bush
quickly indicates that he intends taking tough measures to reduce
the U.S. budget deficit.
   She predicted that the dollar will come under further pressure
this morning and could even move below a support level of 1.7700
marks.
   ``Bush faces big problems with the (U.S.) budget and trade
deficit, which a popular Reagan could avoid addressing,'' the
Milan-based trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.08 yen to a closing 124.65 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 124.71 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7752 West German marks, down from 1.7990
   _1.4930 Swiss francs, down from 1.5005
   _6.0600 French francs, down from 6.1065
   _1.9980 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0190
   _1,319.25 Italian lire, down from 1,330.00
   _1.2333 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2350
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7818, compared with
$1.7707 Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.10 a troy ounce, up
from $418.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $419.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $420.25, up from $418.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.20 to close at a bid $421.32.
   Silver was quoted in London Wednesday at a bid price of $6.39 a
troy ounce, down from Tuesday's $6.41.

   Sen. Dennis DeConcini fended off last-minute
accusations of financial impropriety and defeated a GOP challenger
in a state that has now gone Republican at the presidential level 10
consecutive times.
   With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Vice President George
Bush had 679,844 votes, or 61 percent, to 431,303 for Dukakis, or 39
percent.
   In the Senate race, Deconcini had 630,017 votes, or 58 percent,
to 436,616, or 42 percent, for Republican Keith DeGreen.
   DeConcini easily won a third term despite advertisements late in
the campaign raising questions about the purchase by a DeConcini
family partnership of land in the path of a federal water project
that later was sold to the government at a huge profit.
   DeConcini denied any wrongdoing, maintaining he had no inside
information about the project and that its path was public
knowledge. He also pointed out that DeGreen had failed to vote in
the last three federal elections.
   In House races, Arizona's Democratic Rep. Morris Udall and four
Republicans won re-election.

<HEAD>Four Firms Raided for Counterfeiting Circuit Breakers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 1 graf to ADD that companies could not be reached for

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission raided four
Southern California firms that sold used and mislabeled circuit
breakers to nuclear power plants, the federal agency said.
   The used breakers were refurbished, given false manufacturing
labels and trademarks, then sold as new, Robert Marsh, director of
the NRC's office of investigations in San Francisco, said after
Tuesday's raids.
   It was unclear how many wound up in nuclear plants, but a
preliminary investigation found none in critical areas, Marsh said.
   However, he said the same type of device is used in many
capacities in such plants, including activating emergency safety
systems.
   Records seized in the raids should help authorities discover
which nuclear plants bought the counterfeit parts, Marsh said.
   Records and circuit breakers were seized at Panelboard
Specialties in Lake Elsinore, Rosen Electric Equipment in Pico
Rivera, Dan Luckow Electric in Van Nuys and Luckow Circuit Breaker
in Santa Ana.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration took part in
the raids because some counterfeit circuit breakers have been found
in computers and other equipment at Kennedy Space Center in Florida,
said Daniel Bromley, director of the NASA Office of the Inspector
General at the Jet Propulsion Laboratories in Pasadena.
   Officials at the companies could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush and Democratic Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum brought opposing political views before Ohio
voters and both came away big winners.
   Bush won Ohio's 23 electoral votes Tuesday after a campaign
deriding his opponent as liberal. Metzenbaum, who has never shunned
the liberal label, gained a third term against Republican challenger
George Voinovich.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Metzenbaum had
2,452,533 votes, or 57 percent, to 1,849,627, or 43 percent, for
Voinovich, the mayor of Cleveland.
   Bush had 2,356,987 votes, or 55 percent, to Dukakis' 1,905,880,
or 45 percent.
   Peter Harris, Metzenbaum's campaign manager, said he was not
surprised many Ohioans apparently voted for both Bush and Metzenbaum.
   ``I don't think people are that ideological,'' Harris said. ``I
think if you work hard and people think you are working for them,
ideology doesn't make that much difference.''
   Metzenbaum, 71, had spent more than $7 million, a record for
Ohio, on what he said would be his last campaign.
   Voinovich declined to comment on his political future once his
term expires next year, but he has been mentioned as a possible
candidate for governor or a prospect for Bush's Cabinet.
   The 11-10 majority held by Democrats in Ohio's U.S. House
delegation stayed intact as state Senate President Paul Gillmor, a
Republican, captured the seat being vacated by Rep. Delbert Latta,
who is retiring after 30 years in Congress.

   Six days before the election, Kirkman was indicted by a county

   Republican Stan Stephens, who came to the
United States from Canada to harvest wheat in 1949 and stayed,
parlayed 16 years in the state Senate and Montana's economic
doldrums into a term as the state's chief executive.
   Stephens, 59, was the first announced candidate to succeed
retiring Gov. Ted Schwinden. He won the GOP nomination in an upset
over a young representative from the state's largest city, Billings.
   The Havre resident made leaner government a campaign theme,
saying the economic plans of his opponent, former Democratic Gov.
Thomas Judge, would lead to increased state bureaucracy.
   Stephens pledged to reduce certain property taxes and government
regulation of business in an effort to reinvigorate the private
sector.
   Stephens' appearances on the stump followed years of
behind-the-scenes work in the Legislature, where he served as a
respected and admired mediator on key bills.
   His smooth speaking style often was used on the Senate floor to
summarize opposing views on an issue and bring debate to an end.
   A native of Calgary, Alberta, Stephens is a retired radio
broadcaster and former owner of two cable television companies.
   He left his Canadian high school in his senior year to enroll in
a broadcast training program. After moving to Montana, he began
working at a Havre radio station, and served with the U.S. Army in
the Korean War as a combat correspondent.
   Stephens became a U.S. citizen in 1954, the same year he married
Ann Hanson. They have two daughters.
   Stephens was first elected to the Legislature in 1968. He served
as majority leader in 1979 and 1981, before being chosen Senate
president in 1983.

   New Hampshire voters gave Republicans
another lock on top state offices, including the governorship, and
favored George Bush by a nearly 2-1 margin over neighboring Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Four-term U.S. Rep. Judd Gregg won the governor's seat once held

succeed Gregg in the 2nd Congressional District, while Republican
Rep. Robert Smith won a third term in the 1st District by handily
defeating Joseph Keefe, a former state Democratic vice chairman.
   Bush garnered 279,818 votes, or 63 percent, to Dukakis' 162,370
votes, or 37 percent. New Hampshire has not sided with a Democratic
presidential candidate since 1964.
   Gregg had 264,669 votes, or 61 percent, to McEachern's 170,584
votes, or 39 percent.
   Gregg, 41, a Greenfield lawyer and son of 1953-55 Gov. Hugh
Gregg, said his record and adherence to frugality and lean
government best qualified him to manage the state's finances and its
rapid growth.
   McEachern, 50, a lawyer, was making his third bid for governor.

   Kentuckians, turning against one of their
mainstay industries, overwhelmingly approved a constitutional
amendment that would allow landowners to veto strip mining under
certain mineral deeds.
   The amendment affected deeds that conveyed mineral rights, but
not surface ownership. Agents used hundreds of the deeds to buy up
mineral rights in eastern Kentucky from about 1880 to 1940, before
the advent of strip mining.
   Kentucky courts, unlike courts in other states, consistently
ruled that the deeds allowed coal companies to destroy the surface
to remove their coal and that landowners did not have to be
compensated.

   The amendment to Nebraska's constitution makes a person eligible

   The measure generated spirited debate in the state Legislature,
which put the question to voters.
   Proponents of the measure said teens who turn 18 after the

   The minister for a couple whose
premature infant was snatched from a hospital asked the kidnapper to
``place the child in a warm and safe place'' and call him.
   The Rev. Dennis Edwards made the plea during a live televised
news conference Tuesday night as the baby's mother left the hospital
to return home without her son.
   ``I have reason to believe that the person who took this child
would like to see this child returned safely,'' Edwards, pastor of
St. John Baptist Church, said without elaborating.
   ``Please return this baby to his parents, Willie and Annette
Jones. Place the child in a warm and safe place, and then call me
immediately,'' said the minister, who then gave his home telephone
number.
   Christopher Michael Jones, born six weeks premature, was taken
from his mother's room at Doctors Hospital Nov. 1 by a woman
impersonating a nurse.
   Doctors say the baby needs immediate medical attention and he may
die.
   ``The doctors have assured me that the chance of harm to this
child continue to increase every day,'' Edwards said. ``Christopher
Jones needs continual medical help.''
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones, 32, was able to keep her composure through
many news conferences but broke down earlier Tuesday and wept as she
left the hospital with her husband.
   She issued an impassioned plea to the kidnapper to ``call a
friend, call the police, call a minister and tell them ... `I've
done something wrong.'''
   Police Lt. R.L. ``Bert'' Jenkins said the Police Department had
received as many as 400 calls about the case, but all produced dead
ends.
   ``A number of calls looked very promising when we got them, but
fizzled out,'' Jenkins said after the news conference. He said
police were ``not a whole lot closer to finding the baby'' than they
were Nov. 1.
   Mrs. Thomas-Jones said she would never give up hope her son would
be found.
   ``I leave with a charge to continue the search, continue the
fight,'' she said. ``Once my health gets to the stage where I can
physically, if it's necessary, search every home in Little Rock, I'm
going to find my child.''
   ``We're very disappointed'' to be leaving without the baby, said
the boy's father, Willie, 39.
   On Nov. 1, a woman dressed in a white sweater and white pleated
skirt posing as a nurse went to Mrs. Thomas-Jones' room and took the
baby, saying he needed to be weighed, officials said. A hospital
employee discovered the baby missing about a half-hour later and
notified police.
   Hospital administrator Perry Kinder said the hospital has
received more than 100 calls on a hotline ``some with specific tips
on suspicious situations'' and others with theories about the
kidnapping. About 30 percent of the calls were from people offering
support for the family and the hospital.
   Kinder said a $26,500 reward for the baby's safe return would be
in effect indefinitely. He said the hospital would continue to
provide assistance to the family in keeping the case before the
public ``as long as it takes.''

   Democratic Sen. George Mitchell easily
captured a second term with 81 percent of the vote, and Vice
President George Bush, who summers by the sea in Kennebunkport, won
the state's four electoral votes.
   With 91 percent of the precincts in, Mitchell had 398,988 votes,
or 81 percent, to 92,061 votes, or 19 percent, for Jasper Wyman, a
former Democratic state legislator turned Republican.
   Wyman, head of the conservative Maine Christian Civic League, ran
against Mitchell after more established GOP figures declined.
   In the presidential race, Bush had 269,911 votes, or 56 percent,
to 214,902 votes, or 44 percent, for Democrat Michael Dukakis. The
state has voted Republican in all but three presidential elections
in the past century.
   Both congressional incumbents won re-election _ Democrat Joseph
E. Brennan, a former two-term governor, and Republican Olympia J.
Snowe.

   New Hampshire voters gave Republicans
another lock on top state offices, including the governorship, and
favored George Bush by a nearly 2-1 margin over neighboring Gov.
Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
   Four-term U.S. Rep. Judd Gregg won the governor's seat once held
by his father, beating Democrat Paul McEachern in Tuesday's
balloting to replace retiring three-term Republican Gov. John Sununu.
   Former state Supreme Court Justice Chuck Douglas topped
Democratic Nashua Mayor James Donchess in a bitter campaign to
succeed Gregg in the 2nd Congressional District, while Republican
Rep. Robert Smith won a third term in the 1st District by handily
defeating Joseph Keefe, a former state Democratic vice chairman.
   Bush garnered 279,818 votes, or 63 percent, to Dukakis' 162,370
votes, or 37 percent. New Hampshire has not sided with a Democratic
presidential candidate since 1964.
   Gregg had 264,669 votes, or 61 percent, to McEachern's 170,584
votes, or 39 percent.
   Gregg, 41, a Greenfield lawyer and son of 1953-55 Gov. Hugh
Gregg, said his record and adherence to frugality and lean
government best qualified him to manage the state's finances and its
rapid growth.
   McEachern, 50, a lawyer, was making his third bid for governor.

   Nebraskans sent a Democratic former governor
to the U.S. Senate but gave their electoral votes to Republican
victor George Bush.
   Democrat Bob Kerrey, a Vietnam war hero and popular former
governor, won election to the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, ousting
incumbent Republican David Karnes, who was appointed last year after
the death of Democratic Sen. Edward Zorinsky.
   Kerrey, a 45-year-old Medal of Honor winner who lost part of a

governorship in his first bid for public office in 1982. Karnes, at
39 the youngest member of the Senate, was appointed in March 1987 to
fill the vacancy left by the death of Democrat Ed Zorinsky.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Kerrey had 371,155 votes,
or 57 percent, while Karnes had 272,031 votes or 42 percent.
   In the presidential race, Bush had 388,908 votes, or 60 percent,

<HEAD>Art Institute Returns Stone Carving To Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Art Institute of Chicago says a 1,000-year-old
stone carving of a Hindu god, which vanished from Thailand and later
was displayed at the museum, will begin its return journey to
Bangkok on Thursday.
   The ancient lintel will be installed over an entrance to the
recently restored Phnom Rung temple in northeast Thailand, the Art
Institute said Tuesday.
   The 2-by-3 foot carving, depicting the god Vishnu reclining on
water, disappeared from a Thai temple in the 1960s and later was
donated to the Art Institute by the Chicago-based Alsdorf Foundation.
   Thailand's government has been seeking its return for more than a
decade but was unable to negotiate a settlement with the Art
Institute, which wanted other Thai objects to display in return.
   The Cheney Foundation, which has helped the institute previously,
agreed to provide funds for a piece of comparable artistic merit,
said museum spokeswoman Eileen Harakal.
   After the lintel disappeared from the temple, it was purchased by
a dealer in Bangkok, who sold it to a New York dealer, who finally
sold it to the Alsdorf Foundation. It was on loan to the Art
Institute from 1967 until 1983, when the foundation donated it to
the institute.

   Tradition-minded Virginia voters have once
again passed a gambling referendum, chosen a Republican for
president and elected Charles S. Robb to an office.
   But the results of Tuesday's balloting also have a new slant _
Robb became Virginia's first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate race in
22 years, and voters gave their first approval for horse-track
wagering.
   Robb, whose 1981 election as governor ended a string of GOP
victories, took more than 1.4 million votes to finish 42 percent
ahead of Republican Maurice A. Dawkins.
   ``How sweet it is,'' Robb said at his victory celebration. ``When
we made that comment seven years ago, it had been 16 years since we
won the governor's mansion. When we make that comment tonight, we
close 22 years of history.''
   The pari-mutuel referendum took 56 percent of the vote. ``I think
Virginia has really won on this issue,'' said Del. Raymond R. Guest,
the General Assembly sponsor of pari-mutuel.
   George Bush took 60 percent of the presidential vote. The GOP has
carried Virginia in every White House race since 1968.
   All 10 House incumbents won re-election, none in close races.

   George Bush got the nod from Tennessee
voters who also sent Democratic Sen. James Sasser back to Washington
for a third term with a landslide reminiscent of Republican Howard
Baker's 1972 victory.
   Sasser overwhelmed political newcomer Bill Andersen, by a 2-to-1
margin. Andersen is a law partner of Baker, former White House chief
of staff and senator.
   Bush pocketed the state's 11 electoral votes with 937,966 votes,

   ``We knew George Bush was right on the issues. We've gotten that
feedback from Tennessee voters, and they've proved it,'' said Jon
Thomas, Bush's state campaign chairman.
   Sasser called his triumph ``a victory of the last few months of
campaigning, of the last 12 years of hard work.'' He is in line to
become chairman of the powerful Senate Budget Committee.
   Sasser had 1,019,720 votes, or 66 percent, while Andersen had
535,067, or 34 percent.
   The Democrats maintained their 6-3 margin in the U.S. House

<TEXT>
   The Utah Supreme Court will reconsider an
appeal for a self-proclaimed prophet who said God ordered him to
kill his sister-in-law and her infant child.
   The state's highest court said Tuesday it will reopen portions of
an appeal filed on behalf of condemned killer Ronald Lafferty
because the court did not have the complete trial transcript at the
first hearing.
   Lafferty, 46, was sentenced to die by firing squad for the July
24, 1984, throat-slashing deaths of his sister-in-law, Brenda Wright
Lafferty, and her 15-month-old daughter, Erica, at their American
Fork home.
   Lafferty, who claimed to be a prophet and advocated polygamy,
testified that God ordered him to kill the two. His brother, Dan
Lafferty, also was convicted in the slayings but was sentenced to
two life prison terms.
   The justices, who rejected Lafferty's appeal in January,
tentatively scheduled a hearing for early next year. The court did
not indicate if the ruling was unanimous.
   In oral arguments Monday, Lafferty's attorney, Michael Esplin,
said the 550 pages of transcripts the court did not see dealt with
Lafferty's competence to stand trial, his waiver of an insanity
defense and his ability to effectively assist his attorney during
the 1985 trial.
   Deputy Attorney General Sandra Sjogren, who argued against the
motion, said the missing 550 pages would do nothing to change the
court's decision to deny the appeal.
   A stay of execution will remain in place pending further
proceedings.

   Louisiana voters cast their ballots
according to broad philosophical concerns, not specific issues,
producing a solid victory for George Bush, the vice president's
state campaign director says.
   U.S. Rep. Richard Baker, Bush's state campaign chief, said
Democrats hoped Louisiana's troubled economy, caused by the collapse
of gas and oil prices, would prompt residents to vote for Dukakis.
But the strategy failed.
   U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston, another Republican, analyzed Tuesday's
outcome differently. Dukakis, he said, is ``a classic Northeastern
liberal from a state that consumes energy and has little sympathy
for those who produce it.''
   With all the state's precincts reporting, Bush had 879,423 votes,
or 55 percent, to 714,843 votes, or 45 percent, for Dukakis, keeping
Louisiana in the GOP column for the third consecutive presidential
election and giving Bush 10 electoral votes.
   Republican U.S. Rep. Clyde Holloway of the 8th District defeated
Democrat Faye Williams in a rematch of their 1986 runoff. Williams
had hoped to become the first black elected to Congress from the
state since Reconstruction.
   Seven other state congressional races were settled in the Oct. 1
primary.

   Valentine, 44, an Albuquerque dentist and state senator, said his

early polls showing Bingaman with a mighty lead.
   ``If any of you are looking for a dentist, I'm certainly going to

   Incumbent Democrat Bill Richardson won re-election in the 3rd
District and incumbent Republican Joe Skeen was re-elected without

<HEAD>Newspaper's Drug, Alcohol Testing Policy Ruled Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge ruled that the
Star Tribune engaged in an unfair labor practice by imposing drug
and alcohol testing policies without bargaining with the newspaper's
union.
   The company's refusal to provide information about the policy's
enforcement at the union's request also constituted an unfair labor
practice, the judge, Wallace Nations, said in his ruling last week
in Washington.
   Such testing meets legal definitions of issues that must be
negotiated between employers and unions, the judge said.
   Nations recommended the newspaper offer a job to any applicant
rejected under the policy since it was imposed in January 1987 and
to pay the applicant for related losses. He also recommended that
the company rescind any punishment that might have been imposed on
employees under the policy and compensate them for their losses.
   Diane Williams, assistant director of the National Labor
Relations Board's information division, said the ruling may set a
national precedent because the board has not ruled on appeals of
such matters.
   The Star Tribune's policy requires a medical exam, including drug
and alcohol screening, for applicants to whom the company offers a
job. If applicants test positive for drug use, the company will
withdraw the job offer.
   Under the policy, current employees also may be asked to undergo
screening when management believes job performance or conduct is
impaired by alcohol or drug abuse.
   John Dennison, vice president of labor relations for the
newspaper, said Monday that no employee has been tested under the
policy since it took effect Jan. 1, 1987, and that he knew of one
job applicant who had withdrawn after learning about the policy.
   The newspaper also was urged by the judge to revoke its drug and
alcohol testing policies covering applicants and employees in guild
jobs and to negotiate future policies with The Newspaper Guild of
the Twin Cities. The guild's Local 2 represents about 350 newsroom
and circulation employees of the Star Tribune.
   Dennison said the company was disappointed by the ruling but had
not decided whether to appeal to the full NLRB.
   Joe Moore, the board's deputy executive secretary, said that if
the company does not appeal Nations' ruling by Dec. 1, the board
will adopt it, probably in early December, and the recommendations
will take effect. If the company does appeal, a panel or the full
board will consider it.

   Evan Bayh was elected the nation's youngest
governor, but his sweeping Democratic victory did not prevent the
home state of another youthful candidate, Sen. Dan Quayle, from
falling solidly behind George Bush.
   Bayh, the 32-year-old secretary of state and son of former Sen.
Birch Bayh, defeated two-term Republican Lt. Gov. John Mutz on
Tuesday to end 20 years of Republican control of the governorship.
   Two-term Republican Sen. Richard Lugar also was re-elected by
1,407,568 votes, or 68 percent, to Democrat Jack Wickes' 671,527
votes, or 32 percent, with 99 percent of the precincts reporting.
   Bayh tallied 1,124,163 votes, or 53 percent, and Mutz had 994,359
votes, or 47 percent. GOP Gov. Robert D. Orr, 70, had been barred
from seeking a third term.
   ``I'm feeling a whole lot older right now,'' said Bayh, who when
he is inaugurated on Jan. 9 will be the nation's youngest governor
at 33. ``It's been a long campaign.''
   Mutz, a 53-year-old veteran of Hoosier politics, admitted he was
taking the defeat hard, saying he was ``too old to cry and it hurts
too much to laugh.''
   In the presidential race, Vice President Bush, a Republican, had
1,281,940 votes, or 60 percent, to Democratic Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis' 848,931 votes, or 40 percent. The victory gave Bush
12 electoral votes.
   Indiana voters also repealed the state's 137-year-old
constitutional ban on lotteries.
   In House races, Indiana Democrats managed to protect their 6-4

<HEAD>American Says Hijackers Robbed Passengers</HEAD>

   Confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali
Hamadi and his accomplice stole money and jewelry from passengers
after commandeering a TWA jet, an American testified today.
   The Lebanese Shiite Moslem is charged with murder, air piracy and
robbery in the 1985 seizure of the Athens to Rome flight. U.S. Navy
diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage
for 17 days during the ordeal.
   ``The two hijackers were going up and down the plane relieving
passengers of jewelry. They took a diamond ring from me and more
than $9,000 in cash money,'' said former passenger Jimmy Dell
Palmer, a 51-year-old American.
   Palmer, an air conditioning technician, said he was returning
from a job in Saudi Arabia and had been paid in cash.
   ``The hijackers robbed the passengers. Hamadi conducted the
search,'' Palmer testified. ``I was in fear of my life from the
beginning. I was very scared. Hamadi seemed to be the leader. He
seemed to be giving orders.''
   Palmer did not provide his hometown under guidelines set by the
court to protect witnesses. Palmer lived in Little Rock, Ark., at
the time of the hijacking.
   Hamadi's accomplice struck Palmer once on the head and he lost
consciousness briefly, the former passenger said. The accomplice,
Hassan Ezzeddine, is a fugitive.
   Hamadi's parents, Fatima and Ali Hassan Hamadi, were in the
spectators' section of the courtroom today, separated from the
defendant and judges by bulletproof glass.
   On Tuesday, when his mother entered the heavily guarded courtroom
in Preungesheim prison and began answering questions from the chief
judge, the defendant broke into tears.
   ``I know that my son is innocent. I know that he's very young and
that we live under terrible conditions'' in Beirut, Hamadi's mother
told the court in a soft and shaky voice.
   Suddenly, Hamadi cried and kept his head low as he wiped his eyes
with a handkerchief.
   Hamadi's father told the court his son was younger than 21 when
the hijacking began June 14, 1985.
   ``He was born on Lebanon's Independence Day, Nov. 22, in 1964. I
can remember because it's a holiday and I did not have to work that
day,'' the 59-year-old father told the court.
   The issue of age is important in determining the length of prison
sentence if Mohammed is convicted. If he was not yet 21 when the
hijacking occurred, he would receive a more lenient sentence.
   Prosecutors say Mohammed was born June 13, 1964, and that he
turned 21 the day before the hijacking and is not entitled to
leniency.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. He has
admitted taking part in the hijacking, but says another hijacker
killed Stethem.
   In the week after Mohammed's arrest, two West Germans were
kidnapped in Beirut in an attempt to force West German authorities
to free him.
   The defendant's brother, Abbas Hamadi, 29, was arrested at
Frankfurt airport on Jan. 27, 1987. He was convicted by a
Duesseldorf court in the kidnapping of the two West Germans and
sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   The West German hostages since have been released.

   George Bush won Colorado as expected, but the
effort put forth by Michael Dukakis gave new hope to the state's
Democrats.
   Dukakis won 14 of Colorado's traditionally Republican 63
counties, equaling what former President Jimmy Carter did in 1976,
and doing far better than Carter and Walter Mondale did in
subsequent presidential elections.
   Dukakis outdrew Bush during simultaneous appearances in Denver
last Sunday, a fact that apparently contributed to Bush's
narrower-than-expected margin.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting Republican Bush had
727,228 votes, or 54 percent, to lock up Colorado's eight electoral
votes. Democrat Dukakis had 620,833 votes, or 46 percent.
   Colorado's three Democratic and three Republican congressional
incumbents were re-elected.
   Voters also outlawed state-paid abortions, made English the
state's ``official'' language and rejected an initiative that would
have required voter approval of future tax increases.

   Republican Rep. Don Young was re-elected to
a ninth term Tuesday despite his opponent's attack that he was tied
to special interests, and George Bush won the state's three
electoral votes.
   ``I think Bush's victory in Alaska is understandable,'' said Gov.
Steve Cowper. He attributed it to Dukakis's failure to endorse oil
and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and his
endorsement of gun control, an unpopular position in a state where
handguns outnumber people.
   In the congressional race, with 66 of 438 precincts reporting, or
15 percent, Young, Alaska's lone congressman, had 8,688 votes, or 62
percent, to 5,359 votes, or 38 percent, for Democratic challenger
Peter Gruenstein.
   Gruenstein, 41, a former prosecutor from Anchorage, attacked the
incumbent as beholden to special interests. Young, 44, stressed his
16 years of experience in Congress.
   In the presidential race, with 15 percent of precincts reporting,
Republican Bush had 7,995 votes, or 56 percent, to 5,607 votes, or
39 percent, for Democrat Michael Dukakis.

   Democrats easily swept North Dakota's key
statewide races in what a re-elected Democratic senator called ``a
tremendous victory across our state.''
   But Republican George Bush won the state's three presidential
electoral votes.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, 80, overcame questions about his mental and
physical fitness to win a fifth full term by defeating Republican
Earl Strinden, the longtime majority leader in the state House of
Representatives.
   Gov. George Sinner was given a second four-year term, even though
he pushed the largest tax increase in state history through the
Legislature two years ago, and Rep. Byron Dorgan won a fifth term in
the state's lone U.S. House seat.
   ``This is a tremendous victory across our state. ... Now we must
fulfill our mandate,'' Burdick said Tuesday night.
   Burdick led Strinden by 61 percent to 39 percent with 92 percent
of the state's precincts reporting. Dorgan led Republican Steve
Sydness 72 percent to 28 percent, and Sinner was also well ahead of
GOP challenger Leon Mallberg 60 percent to 40 percent.
   Bush led Dukakis 56 percent to 44 percent.

<HEAD>Soldiers Enforce 24-Hour Curfew After Moslem Riots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers enforced a 24-hour curfew in
Nigeria's northwestern town of Sokoto today after 10 people died and
buildings were set afire in three days of rioting over a new Moslem
leader.
   Quoting police sources, state-owned Radio Nigeria said 10
civilians were killed and five policemen were seriously injured in
violence that began Sunday after Ibrahim Dasuki was appointed Sultan
of Kano.
   It is a powerful position, commanding the 50 million Moslems who
make up 43 percent of the population of Nigeria, Africa's most
influential and populous nation. The sultan also is revered by
Moslems in neighboring West African states and his opinions are
sought by Nigerian leaders of the other religions, Christian and
animist.
   Reporters in Lagos said people in Sokoto believed the military
forced the committee of Moslem elders that selected the new sultan
to choose Dasuki instead of the eldest son of the late Sultan Sadiq
Abubakar.
   Abubakar led Nigeria's Moslems for 50 years. He died last week at
age 85.
   A Radio Nigeria correspondent reported police Monday fired live
ammunition into a crowd near Nargata College in Sokoto, where Dusaki
went to school. They hit one person in the head, another in the jaw
and a third in the stomach, the reporter said. He did not disclose
the fate of the victims nor say how the others died.
   The radio said shops and government offices remained shuttered.
It made no mention of 2,000 inmates the rioters freed from the local
prison. The radio said Tuesday the inmates had been set free.
   The military government sent soldiers to patrol streets and
ordered everyone to stay indoors Tuesday after policemen failed to
stop rioters.
   Tension in the predominantly Moslem town, 465 miles north of
Lagos, started Friday after the local radio made contradictory
announcements about the succession.
   State-owned Rima Radio first reported Abubakar's eldest son,
Muhammadu Maccido, had been named sultan. Police arrested the
station's general manager and four of its employees. There has been
no news of them.
   The station then announced the nine-member selection committee
had not reached a decision.
   Thousands of Maccido supporters, wearing amulets and wielding
daggers, took to the streets Monday chanting ``Ba Mu So,'' which
means ``We don't want'' in local Hausa.
   Police fled as the rioters set fire to the Rima Radio building,
marched on the prison, then torched a Health Ministry building and
the local branch of the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. Dasuki is chairman of the bank's local board.

<HEAD>Voters In Four States Reject Tax Reform Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Utah rejected measures that would have slashed taxes on
income, sales and cigarettes, Coloradans defeated an amendment to
cut income taxes by 10 percent and voters dumped tax-reform efforts
in Arkansas and South Dakota.
   Nevadans overwhelmingly approved a constitutional prohibition on
personal income taxes. The measure, backed by the casino industry,
was approved 83 percent to 17 percent.
   South Dakotans rejected Proposition II, which would have rolled
back property taxes and limited future increases, by 61-39 percent,
with 96 percent of the precincts reporting.
   Coloradans defeated a ``Taxpayers Bill of Rights Amendment,''
which would have cut income taxes about 10 percent, limited property
taxes and required voter approval on future hikes except in
emergencies. The measure lost, 58 percent to 42 percent, with 99
percent of the precincts reporting.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer celebrated the defeat. ``It's good to get
that one behind us,'' he said.
   ``It would be bad for Colorado. I see two messages here. Citizens
want to prepare for the future, and we need to continue to be as
efficient and frugal as we can continue to be.''
   In Utah, voters overwhelmingly rejected three tax initiatives
that together would have lowered state and local revenues by $329
million. The measures would have limited property taxes, rolled back
income, sales, gasoline and cigarette taxes, and granted tax credits
for private education.
   A ``Fair Tax Amendment'' that would have made it easier for the
Arkansas legislature to raise certain taxes failed 62-38 percent
with 95 percent of the precincts reporting.

   Gov. Madeleine Kunin won a third term and
Republican Rep. James Jeffords breezed into the Senate, while
Republican Peter Smith narrowly defeated a Socialist's bid for a
seat in Congress.
   In the presidential race, George Bush all but confined
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis to his back yard, carrying
Vermont along with the New England states of Maine, Connecticut and
New Hampshire.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting Tuesday, Democrat
Kunin had 126,952 votes, or 55 percent, and GOP state legislator
Michael Bernhardt had 102,276 votes, or 44 percent. A third-party
candidate had 2,630 votes, or 1 percent.
   Kunin saw the vote as an affirmation of her philosophy of
government and her campaigns to improve the environment and
education. Bernhardt's campaign was based on local government
control. Kunin also hopes the victory will inspire other women.
   ``I hope it provides an example to others to enter the fray,''
she said.
   In the race for Vermont's three electoral votes, Republican
George Bush had 119,969 votes, or 52 percent, to 111,879 votes, or
48 percent, for Dukakis.
   In the Senate race, Jeffords had 157,735 votes, or 70 percent, to
68,616 votes, or 30 percent, for Democrat William Gray, a former
U.S. attorney making his first run for statewide office. Jeffords
had been heavily favored.
   In the race for Jeffords' old House seat, Smith, a former
lieutenant governor, had 96,059 votes or 42 percent. He was trailed
by Bernard Sanders, Burlington's Socialist mayor running as an
independent, with 87,318 or 38 percent, and Democrat Paul Poirier,
with 43,769, or 19 percent.

   George Bush took South Dakota's three
electoral votes and U.S. Rep. Tim Johnson won a second term with the
widest margin of victory posted by any Democrat in the state's
99-year history.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Republican Bush had
165,003 votes, or 53 percent, to Democrat Dukakis' 145,252 votes, or
47 percent.
   Johnson, the state's sole member of the U.S. House, defeated
state Treasurer David Volk. With 99 percent of the precincts
tallied, Johnson had 223,071, or 72 percent. Volk had 88,041, or 28
percent.
   Johnson said his victory was proof that voters base their
decision on the candidate, not the party. ``I don't think anybody
can rely on their party affiliation any longer,'' he said.
   By a margin of 64 percent to 36 percent, voters approved a plan
to allow limited gambling in the western city of Deadwood, where
Wild Bill Hickock was gunned down 112 years ago while playing poker.
A proposed constitutional amendment that would have rolled back
property taxes and limited future increases was overwhelmingly
rejected.
   Voters also rejected two laws aimed at protecting the Black Hills
from surface mining.

   With 96 percent of precincts reporting, Bryan had 173,174 votes,

   Bush took the state with 60 percent of the vote to Gov. Michael
Dukakis's 38 percent.
   Bryan had begun the campaign with a 30-point lead in opinion
polls, but was hurt by President Reagan's visit and by Dukakis's
decision, late in the campaign, to accept Congress' designation of
Nevada as the site for the nation's first high-level nuclear waste
repository.
   In congressional races, incumbent Republican Rep. Barbara
Vucanovich easily withstood a challenge from Democrat Jim Spoo,
winning with a 58-40 percent margin. And Democrat Rep. Jim Bilbray

   Palestinians blocked roads with burning tires,
unfurled outlawed national flags and shut businesses today in a
general strike marking the start of the 12th month of their uprising
against Israel.
   Soldiers shot and wounded three Arab teen-agers in clashes in the
occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   In Gaza City's Mograbi Quarter, soldiers who were being stoned
responded with a favorite weapon of Palestinian youths, the
slingshot, before opening fire with guns, an Arab witness said.
   A 17-year-old Palestinian boy later was wounded in the hip with a
plastic bullet in that incident, said an official at Ahli Arab
hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Another youth, also 17, suffered a serious chest wound from a
plastic bullet in the Nozeirat refugee camp, the official added. A
third youth was reported grazed in the head in a clash in Gaza City.
   Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
meanwhile, published demands that the government take tougher action
against Palestinian rioters. The demands came after a 52-year-old
woman settler was injured in the head by a stone.
   The stoning attack occurred Tuesday while the victim was in a car
just inside Israel that had come from the West Bank, Israeli news
reports said.
   The victim, Margaret Rosner, was in serious condition today in
Beilinson Hospital near Tel Aviv, a hospital official said.
   Public transportation was halted and shops closed in the latest
strike against the Israeli occupation of the territories captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, activists sprayed walls with
slogans praising the PLO's plans to declare Palestinian independence
at a meeting of the Palestine National Council which begins Nov. 12.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 10-member inner Cabinet also
debated the upcoming PLO meeting, including ways of responding to an
expected increase in Palestinian violence, Israel radio reported.
   Twelve Palestinians were injured Tuesday during clashes with
soldiers, Arab hospital officials said.
   Violence broke out in the Arab village of Taibe in northern
Israel, where residents set tires ablaze and hurled firebombs and
stones to protest the demolition Monday of 15 illegally built houses.
   Hundreds of police responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Two police officers and an Arab were injured, Israel radio said.
   It was the first serious riot by Israeli Arabs since January
protests in solidarity with the revolt by Palestinians in the
occupied lands against Israel's 21-year rule. At least 309
Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died since the uprising began Dec.
8.
   The latest fatalities came Monday when an Arab laborer stabbed to
death an Israeli soldier and was shot to death by another soldier.
   On Tuesday, the army said it bulldozed about a dozen shacks of
Palestinian migrant workers in the West Bank shantytown of Jiftlic,
25 miles northeast of Jerusalem, in retaliation for the stabbing.
   About 100 people were left homeless, Arab reports said.

   The collection was established by Carlotta Monterey, O'Neill's
third wife, whom he married in 1929. She left to Yale all surviving
play material, including manuscripts, notes, drawings for sets, plot
summaries, photographs, drafts of correspondence and memorabilia.
   O'Neill, the author of ``The Iceman Cometh,'' ``A Moon for the

<HEAD>Dispatcher Held Call on Fire in Which 5 Died, Police Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police dispatcher has resigned after he
mistakenly held a call for more than 30 minutes about a house fire
that killed five people.
   Police Chief Mack Vines said Tuesday the 911 call was received at
10:31 p.m. Sunday, but the dispatcher held it, believing whoever was
on the other end had hung up.
   Fire trucks responded at 11:07 p.m. after a neighbor reported the
fire.
   Killed were Mary Graham, 75; two of her grandchildren; and two of
her great-grandchildren, officials said.
   Dispatcher James D. Mercer was in his fifth week of six weeks of
dispatch training.
   Mercer called his failure to act swiftly a ``mistake'' that he
blamed on inexperience.
   ``I feel very distraught and very sad,'' he said.
   ``This was a priority one call, and I should have dispatched it
earlier, but I neglected to,'' Mercer said.
   The dispatcher said he had no available patrol cars to send at
first, and then ``overlooked'' it as other calls came in. ``I had
held calls like that before. Everybody does. You have to when you
don't have (officers available). Many times in the five weeks that
I've been there, we've been 15 to 20 calls behind. There are not
enough offices to answer the calls.''
   Vines said he doesn't know if quicker action could have saved any
of the victims.
   ``It's difficult to say, obviously, because we don't know the
time of death, the time or origin of the fire,'' Vines said. ``But
we are an emergency center, and we are compelled to dispatch people
on an emergency basis.''

<HEAD>English: Voters Make it Official Language in Three States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida, Colorado and Arizona voters made English their official
state language, settling a war of words that prompted lawsuits and
the resignations of key proponents, including Walter Cronkite.
   Seventeen states have now passed laws or amendments designating
English their official language.
   In Florida, where the U.S. Justice Department had joined
unsuccessful efforts to remove the measure from the ballot, 84
percent of voters decided to declare English the official state
language with 98 percent of the tally in. Opponents had complained
that petitions weren't circulated in Spanish in six of Florida's 67
counties.
   Florida's Amendment 11 designates English the state's official
language and gives the Legislature authority to pass laws enforcing
that status.
   Coloradans endorsed a similar measure, which won by a 61-39
percent margin with 99 percent of the precincts reporting.
   The vote was closer in Arizona, where it was approved 51-49
percent with 97 percent of the precincts counted.
   Arizona's Proposition 106 requires state and county governments
to conduct all business in English, with certain exceptions in the
areas of education, public health and safety, the justice system and
federal election law.
   Opponents of the official-English movement said the stakes were
especially high in Florida.
   ``We want to turn the heat on this one and try to slow it down,''
said Jeff Browne, statewide coordinator of Speak Up Now For Florida,
which opposes the amendment. ``If it passes in Florida, I think it
makes Texas, which is the next target state, more likely to pass
this type of law.''
   Browne had contended that English is already the de facto
official language of both Florida and the country and that the
amendment would threaten fundamental liberties.
   In an action growing out of the campaigns, former CBS anchorman
Cronkite resigned on Oct. 13 from the advisory board of U.S.
English, a group founded in 1983 by John Tanton and former Sen. S.I.
Hayakawa of California to promote a U.S. constitutional amendment.
   Cronkite said he believed the Arizona proposal could hurt
minorities, though he said he remains opposed to bilingualism.
   On Oct. 17, Linda Chavez, a former White House aide during the
Reagan administration, resigned as president of U.S. English, citing
a report that at least one major contributor to the group has
advocated forced sterilization. She did not elaborate.
   That same day, U.S. English co-founder Tanton resigned. Both
Cronkite and Ms. Chavez had expressed concern over a 1986 memo
Tanton wrote suggesting that too many recent immigrants have been
Roman Catholics and that Hispanics bring with them a trend toward
corruption.

<TEXT>
   The death toll from Typhoon Skip
climbed today to at least 90, and officials said the storm left tens
of thousands of people homeless as it tore through the central
Philippines.
   The latest figures brought to more than 500 the number of people
known killed by three storms that have ravaged this archipelago
nation in the past two weeks.
   The government weather service today downgraded Skip to a
tropical storm and said it was in the South China Sea, headed for
Vietnam. Peak winds had declined to 68 mph, compared with 108 mph
when the storm struck the central island of Samar on Monday.
   Skip's center moved across the islands about 100 miles south of
Manila, sparing the capital the widespread damage it suffered when
Typhoon Ruby crossed land on Oct. 24.
   The Social Services Department said at least 1 million people
were affected by Skip, meaning their homes or property were
destroyed or damaged. The Office of Civil Defense said about 70,000
people were left homeless.
   Reports from the government's Office of Civil Defense and the
Philippine Red Cross showed 36 people were killed on Palawan, where
Skip triggered widespread flooding. At least 70 more people were
reported missing on the island.
   The next hardest hit area was Camarines Sur province on
southeastern Luzon, where 26 people were killed in landslides and
tornadoes. The civil defense office said at least 13 more were
listed as missing in an avalanche that killed 20 people in the
municipality of Pasacao, 160 miles southeast of Manila.
   At least 13 people drowned in three Manila suburbs that were
flooded by the swollen lake Laguna de Bay, officials said.
   The other deaths reported were on the islands of Panay, Cebu,
Marinduque and Mindanao.
   Skip was the 20th cyclone to hit the Philippines this year and
the third since Typhoon Ruby ravaged virtually the entire country
during the last week of October.
   Officials said Typhoon Ruby killed at least 181 people on land
and at least 64 others perished and more than 200 are missing from
the passenger ship Dona Marilyn that sank.
   They said Tropical Storm Tess, which swept through the Visayas
Islands on Saturday, caused floods that killed 11 people.

<HEAD>Palm Beach Council Votes to Ban Movie-Making During Party Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Movie stars from around the world are
still welcome at this exclusive resort during its annual party
season; they just won't be allowed to make any movies under a
proposal before the Town Council.
   The council Monday passed on first reading an ordinance that
would ban all movie-making at Palm Beach from Nov. 15 to April 15,
the months when an international set of wealthy sun-seekers flood
the island.
   If it receives final approval next month, the ban would extend to
``B.L. Stryker,'' the new series of television action films that
Burt Reynolds is shooting in Palm Beach County.
   Reynolds had asked for permission to use the Palm Beach police
station as a principal location for the ABC-TV show. But Palm Beach
officials refused, and the Boca Raton police station will be used
instead.
   ``The season is our busiest time of the year,'' Councilman
Bernard Heeke said. ``We don't want any unnecessary disruptions.''
   Not being able to film at Palm Beach for the duration of the
season when more than 100 balls and luncheons crowd the calender
would be a problem for ``B.L. Stryker'' series producer Alan
Barnette.
   In the show, Reynolds' ex-wife lives on the island and the Palm
Beach police chief is a regular character.
   ``I would really have to sit down and consider our options,''
Barnette said.

<HEAD>New Director Moves Quickly To Overhaul Police Curriculum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TRUDY TYNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal for totally revamping the
state's police training program, which is blamed in the death of a
cadet, will be unveiled by month's end, the new director of training
has promised.
   Peter W. Agnes Jr., assistant secretary of public safety, took
over the Criminal Justice Training Council following the resignation
Nov. 2 of director Gary Egan. That same day, Timothy Shepard, 25,
died. The cadet had lingered for 44 days and undergone a liver
transplant after collapsing with heat stroke on the first day of
training at the state's Agawam academy.
   ``I have attended a number of police funerals, and never have I
felt the depth of feeling as in that church and outside,'' Agnes
said of Shepard's funeral Monday. ``As the Bishop (Joseph Maguire of
Springfield) said in his eloquent message, we can't miss the
opportunity to use this tragedy.''
   ``We have a great need to demonstrate to the public quickly and
in a most decisive way possible that the training programs will be
made safe and the best they can be,'' Agnes said Tuesday in a
telephone interview from his Boston office.
   State Attorney General James Shannon has sought an inquest into
Shepard's death to determine whether criminal charges should be
brought against State Police instructors. Shannon blamed the
rigorous day of stress training and inadequate water for the
hospitalization of Shepard and 15 other cadets in the class of 50.
   Agnes immediately outlawed the use of physical activity as
punishment.
   He said Tuesday that he planned to have an outline for the new
curriculum ready for the council's Nov. 30 meeting. It could be
launched as a pilot program begining in January.
   ``It would be a terrible mistake to put this on hold and study it
for a year,'' Agnes said.

   The winners sang ``Amazing Grace'' in Georgia.
   In Massachusetts, in a Sons of Italy hall already set up for
tonight's bingo game, red-haired, red-faced Paul Casey's victory _
he became the first Democrat sent to the state legislature from tony
Winchester in at least 50 years _ was marked by a rendition of
``Toura, Loura, Loura,'' played on a banjo.
   A crowd of about 100 chomped on cold cuts and swigged Budweisers
as the favorable results trickled in.
   No matter that a TV in the corner, its sound turned down, was
reporting that another son of Massachusetts, Michael Dukakis, was
losing another race.
   The song in New Jersey, where Sen. Frank Lautenberg defeated
Republican Pete Dawkins, was Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the USA.''
   And in Nebraska, former Gov. Robert Kerrey, who lost part of his
right leg in Vietnam, fulfilled a longstanding promise by serenading
supporters with an a capella version of ``Waltzing Matilda,'' a song
about an Australian soldier who loses a leg in battle.
   Kerrey, a Medal of Honor winner, said he had promised members of
his Navy SEAL team that he'd sing the song if he won the Senate seat.
   He sang for five minutes. Then, ``we'll waltz tonight and work
tomorrow,'' he said _ and the quiet auditorium erupted into cheers.
   Election Day 1988 transformed weary campaigners into energetic
winners and singers. Losing candidates became philosophers. And,
sometimes, bitter rivals became peacemakers, willing to bury the
hatchet.
   ``I'm not tired, I'm ready to go out and answer the bell for the
next round,'' said Lautenberg while the band belted out the
requisite Springsteen anthem.
   Dawkins, who had frequently accused his opponent of using his
office for personal gain, offered his congratulations. Lautenberg,
who had accused Dawkins of deceiving voters, suggested they get
together for coffee.
   ``A battle lost is often the strongest beginning,'' said Dawkins,
the loser.
   ``In my view, we have won,'' said his wife.
   ``Amazing Grace'' was the song Democrat Ben Jones chose to sing
at the Omni Hotel in Atlanta, where he celebrated his U.S. House
victory over Republican Rep. Pat Swindall.
   Jones is a former TV star who once battled alcoholism. Swindall
is under indictment for perjury.
   The contest had reached a memorable crescendo when Jones told
Swindall: ``Being called dishonest by you is like being called ugly
by a possum.''
   On election night, Swindall was all smiles. ``Ben won it fair and
square. Let's all wish, seriously, Ben and Vivian Jones the very
best for the next two years,'' he said.
   In Kentucky, a long winning streak grew a bit longer. Democratic
Rep. William H. Natcher held fast to the 2nd District seat he first
won in a special election 35 years ago.
   The victory also will enable Natcher to add to his record string
of consecutive roll-call votes on Capitol Hill: 15,902, an
achievement that has earned him a spot in the Guiness Book of
Records.
   ``I've been to the post 46 times (in) primary and November
elections,'' Natcher said. ``I'm in excellent health and they spent
a lot of money against me, but my blood pressure is good. They don't
scare me.''
   Natcher refused to engage in an open campaign with his Republican
opponent, who was reduced to traveling the district with a cardboard
cutout of Natcher's likeness. The incumbent, who accepts no campaign
contributions, said he spent $2,564 of his own money, compared to
the $78,000 spent by his Republican opponent, Martin A. Tori.
   ``Some more are going to run and spend some money,'' said
Natcher. ``But with the help of the people of the 2nd District,
we'll entertain 'em.''

   A team of Laotian and U.S. experts will
excavate a U.S. warplane crash site next month to search for remains
of missing American servicemen, a U.S. official said today.
   The search will take place Dec. 10 in Nong district of the
central Laotian province of Savannakhet, the official Laotian news
agency KPL said Tuesday. It gave no more details on the crash site.
   The report, seen in Bangkok today, quoted a news release from
Laos' Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   It would be the fourth joint excavation in the communist nation
and the second this year. The U.S. official, who requested
anonymity, said Laos has pledged to conduct three joint excavations
this year.
   In May, U.S. and Laotian soldiers searched a remote hillside in
Savannakhet but failed to find the remains of two fliers missing
after their plane was shot down in 1966.
   The United States is seeking to account for 2,387 American
servicemen and civilians missing in action, or MIA, from the war in
Vietnam, which also spilled over into neighboring Laos and Cambodia.
Most of those unaccounted for are airmen who crashed.
   The war that cost 58,000 American lives ended with communist
victories in all three countries in 1975.
   Officials have made good progress on the MIA issue this year.
   On Nov. 3, Vietnam returned what it believes to be the remains of
23 Americans. That brought to 100 the number of suspected remains
Vietnam has repatriated since agreeing in August 1987 to hasten
cooperation on the issue.
   Also this month, U.S.-Vietnamese teams completed the second joint
field investigations in the countryside to find out the fates of
American airmen shot down over northern Vietnam.
   The teams found no remains, but an informed source said today
that they retrieved some personal effects that may have belonged to
missing Americans, including a helmet that villagers had been using
to grind rice.
   He said the teams surveyed a crash site and otherwise
investigated a few cases in mountainous areas of Ha Son Binh, Hai
Hung and Son La provinces near the national capital of Hanoi.
   They interviewed villagers with information about the missing
men, but the source said the sites must be excavated before the
cases could be resolved.

<HEAD>GOP Wins Fifth Consecutive Presidential Victory in Michigan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with last congressional race decided and approval of
state-paid abortions, new vote totals.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan gave Republicans their fifth straight
presidential victory, sending George Bush to the White House with 20
electoral votes from the nation's industrial heartland.
   But voters Tuesday sent Democrat Donald Riegle back to the U.S.
Senate with a vote of landslide proportions.
   They also re-elected 11 Democrats and seven Republicans to the
U.S. House, leaving the state's congressional lineup unchanged, and
approved a ban on state-paid abortions for poor women.
   In the presidential race, with 92 percent of the votes counted,
Bush had 1,759,346 votes, or 53 percent, and Michael Dukakis had
1,531,019, or 47 percent.
   The political year began with a bitter battle between mainstream
and conservative Republicans for control of the party.
   The Bush nomination, however, brought unity. ``We pulled together
the whole campaign,'' said state Republican Chairman Spencer Abraham.
   State Democratic Chairman Richard Wiener said Dukakis was hurt by
his failure to respond early to attack ads run by the Bush campaign.
   ``I wish he would have kicked back sooner,'' Wiener said.
   The Dukakis loss came despite strong support for the Democratic
ticket from the United Auto Workers, the state's most powerful union.
   In the Senate race, Riegle received 1,921,074 votes, or 61
percent, against 1,205,590, or 39 percent, for his GOP opponent,
former U.S. Rep. Jim Dunn.

   Oregon voters rejected what would have been
the nation's strictest anti-smoking law and handed Democrat Michael
Dukakais a consolation victory.
   The initiative measure would have banned smoking in most
workplaces and indoor public accommodations. With 99 percent of the
precincts reporting, 61 percent of the votes said ``no.''
   Tobacco companies had spent $2.5 million to persuade Oregonians
that such a measure would go too far and infringe on smokers' rights.
   Dukakis garnered Oregon's seven electoral votes Tuesday in his
losing bid for the White House. With 98 percent of the precincts
reporting, Dukakis drew 567,752 votes, 53 percent, to 512,387, or 47
percent for Republican George Bush.
   Voters approved a measure to repeal Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's order
barring state government discrimination against homosexuals. They
rejected measures to require seat belt use by all motorists and to
increase cigarette and beer taxes to pay for college sports.
   In a U.S. House race, Democrat Mike Kopetski scored an apparent
upset victory over four-term Republican Rep. Denny Smith. Complete
unofficial returns gave Kopetski a 1,273-vote victory out of more
than 205,000 cast. A number of absentee ballots were yet to be
counted.

   Heavily outspent pro-lottery forces eked out
a narrow victory, while traditionally conservative voters
overwhelmingly gave their four electoral votes to George Bush.
   The state's two congressmen also won easy re-elections Tuesday
over relatively minor challenges.
   Bush swamped Democrat Michael Dukakis by nearly 2-1, almost the
same margins by which Democrat Rep. Richard Stallings and Republican
Rep. Larry Craig retained their seats. With 99 percent of precincts
reporting, Bush had 253,461 votes, or 63 percent, to Dukakis'
147,384 votes, or 37 percent.
   A constitutional amendment authorizing a state-run lottery
prompted a massive advertising blitz by opponents.But with 870 of
875 precincts reporting, 210,532 voters, or 52 percent, approved the
measure, while 196,268, or 48 percent, opposed it.
   ``We were under a barrage of media messages to the tune of
three-quarters of a million dollars,'' said Larry LaRocco, leader of
Idahoans for the Lottery. Randy Furniss, director of the
anti-lottery umbrella group Consider, said his group was looking
into legal challenges to the vote.
   The Legislature has approved a bill establishing a lottery next
year, contingent upon passage of the ballot measure.
   A 1986 lottery initiative was voided by the courts as an illegal
attempt to bypass the constitutional lottery ban.
   Lottery backers, outspent by more than 200-1, relied on a federal
equal-time provision to get out their message. They discounted
warnings that a lottery would lead to casino gambling, and
emphasized a lottery's economic value to the state.

<TEXT>
   Wounded Lebanese militia commander Antoine Lahd
was in intensive care today after suffering a setback while
recovering from an assassination attempt, a hospital official and
news reports said.
   The 61-year-old Lahd's condition deteriorated Tuesday night and
his blood pressure plummeted, said Dr. Zvi Ben-Ishai of Rambam
Hospital in Haifa.
   Lahd was wounded in the arm by the bullet Monday in an attack in
south Lebanon. He suffered massive bleeding because a major blood
vessel was hit, Ben-Ishai said.
   The national Itim news agency, quoting Dr. Shimon Burstein,
director of the hospital intensive care unit, said Lahd was on a
respirator. Itim quoted Burstein as saying the militia leader's his
condition stabilized this afternoon after he received blood
transfusions.
   Burstein was quoted as saying it could take up to two weeks for
Lahd's condition to improve, adding that his ``chances of
recuperating are strong,'' Itim said.
   The Maariv daily reported Israeli troops blew up the home of a
21-year-old Lebanese woman, Soha Fayez Bishara, who allegedly shot
Lahd at his home in Marjayoun in south Lebanon. Ms. Bishara is from
the nearby village of Deir Mimas.
   The army denied it destroyed the woman's home.
   Dr. Caesar Sakr, an aide to Lahd, said the woman and Lahd were
drinking coffee together when she suddenly pulled out a pistol and
shot him.
   The Israeli army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, was
quoted as saying Tuesday that Lahd ignored warnings that Ms. Bishara
was a security risk. She got to know Lahd by acting as a dance
instructor for his wife, Minerva.
   Lahd heads the South Lebanon Army militia, whose 2,000 fighters
help Israeli soldiers patrol a six-to-10-mile-wide security zone in
Lebanon that Israel created to protect its northern border.
   Responsibility for the attack on Lahd was claimed by a coalition
of Syrian-backed leftist groups in Lebanon. The coalition, called
the Lebanese National Resistance Front, said in Beirut on Tuesday
that the shooting was in support of the Palestinian uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

   Rescue workers still have not been able to reach
thousands of victims of an earthquake that left more than 100,000
people homeless three days ago, officials told aid agencies today.
   More than 1 million people live in the affected area and hundreds
are seriously injured, the Ministry of Civil Affairs told the U.N.
Development Program and World Food Program.
   Chinese officials told the agencies they do not know whether many
people are trapped alive in wreckage in the mountainous,
jungle-covered region, said Trevor Page, the World Food Program
representative in Beijing.
   The Yunnan provincial government said the injured were being
treated at the scene because there was no way to transport them to
Kunming, the provincial capital 240 miles to the northeast.
   Sunday's quake struck 16 square miles of a remote southern region
along the border with Burma.
   Helicopters were ferrying medical teams and supplies into the
area today, according to official reports. Page said the ministry
reported some roads had been reopened but others remained cut.
   Page said officials did not raise the death toll from Tuesday's
938, but said 607 of the dead were at the epicenter. The official
China News Service issued a new count of 1,986 injured.
   The ministry officials told the aid agencies China would welcome
food and medicine for the victims, mainly farmers of the Lahu, Dai
and Va minorities.
   According to Page, offers of plastic sheeting, medical supplies
and food would be welcome. Page said his agency could not help
because it was committed to other emergencies worldwide.
   The ruling Communist Party and the State Council, China's
Cabinet, in a statement sympathized with quake victims and urged
them to rebuild their homes and restore production. The central
government has allocated $54 million for rescue work.
   State-run Beijing Radio said 5,000 temporary shelters had been
erected and large quantities of materials for building more were
being sent to the region.
   It said about 1,000 soldiers were deployed as rescue workers.
   China's nationally telecast evening news Tuesday showed rows of
collapsed houses in an unidentified village and bodies being lifted
from the debris.
   Sunday's earthquake registered 7.6 on the Richter scale _ a major
quake capable of causing widespread, heavy damage. The Richter scale
is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by
the ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   By this morning, 184 aftershocks had been felt and Li Xuanhu of
the State Seismological Bureau in Beijing said more shocks measuring
6.0 on the Richter scale were likely.
   China's worst quake of modern times, which leveled the
northeastern city of Tangshan and killed 242,000 people in 1976,
measured 7.8 on the Richter scale.

   Pressing for gains in the Senate, Democrats won 19 of 33 seats up
this year and were ahead in one other race _ Florida. They grabbed
Virginia, Nebraska, Nevada and Connecticut seats away from the GOP
and also won in Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio,
Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin.
   Republicans won 13 races _ in Mississippi, where they picked up a
seat that had been held by a Democrat, and in Washington, Indiana,
Vermont, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, Minnesota,
Utah, Wyoming and California.
   The current party split in the Senate is 54 Democrats and 46
Republicans. The election will give the Democrats a 56-44 advantage
in the next Senate.
   Among highlights: Democrats Charles S. Robb in Virginia, Dick

   Democrats bolstered their majority control of
the Senate by ousting three-term GOP maverick Lowell Weicker of
Connecticut, who refused to concede defeat, and by capturing
Republican seats in Virginia, Nevada and Nebraska.
   Democrats won four seats previously held by Republicans and the
GOP captured two seats held by Democrats, raising the Democratic
margin of control to 56-44, a two-seat gain if Democrats hold on to
Florida.
   Several races were decided by narrow tallies, and the contest in
Florida remained extremely tight and too close to call. By
midmorning, Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay's 8,000-vote lead over
conservative Republican Rep. Connie Mack had dropped to about 5,300
with 100,000 absentee ballots to be counted later in the day.
   ``We might have a couple of recounts before we're done,'' said
Tom Mason, a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
   The GOP's wins came in Montana where former farm broadcaster
Conrad Burns edged out Democratic Sen. John Melcher, who was seeking
a third term, and in Mississippi, where Rep. Trent Lott, the deputy
House Republican leader, defeated Rep. Wayne Dowdy for the seat
being vacated by Sen. John Stennis, the Senate's senior Democrat.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who went down to defeat with Michael
Dukakis as the Democratic vice presidential candidate, did not end
Election Day empty-handed. He won re-election to a fourth Senate
term.
   The election decisions give President-elect George Bush the
prospect of opening his administration with Congress solidly in
Democratic hands.
   ``It's going to be tougher,'' said Senate Minority leader Bob
Dole of Kansas, conceding that the GOP's numbers in the Senate would
be shaved in the 101st Congress. ``We're going to have fewer than we
had last year.''
   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he believes that Bush
will find a cooperative spirit on Capitol Hill because ``the
problems are too important for Congress not to work with the
president.''
   Connecticut Attorney General Joseph Lieberman edged Weicker by a
paper-thin margin after a hard-fought campaign in which he accused
the senator of pursuing his own brand of liberal politics while
ignoring home state concerns.
   Weicker, who first gained national attention as a gruff,
outspoken member of the Senate Watergate Committee and who became
one of the Senate's most liberal and independent members, refused to
concede.
   ``I wish I were here to declare a victory or defeat,'' Weicker
told supporters. ``Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to do either
right now.''
   But he added: ``No matter how all this turns out, I don't have
one single gripe.''
   Lieberman portrayed him in television commercials as a sleeping
bear who missed important votes. The attack undermined Weicker's
winning coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats.
   The Senate race in Florida remained too close to call, and
Republicans had high hopes of picking up the seat of retiring
Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   The race was so tight that a decision might rest in the counting
of an estimated 100,000 absentee ballots. The Mack campaign said
they expected to do better than MacKay since traditionally a large
number of such ballots are cast by military personnel, a group that
Mack considers among his constituency.
   Mack's strategists said they would request an automatic recount
of the ballots, a process to which they are entitled under Florida
law if the winner and loser are separated by half a percentage point
or less.
   Dole, who lost to George Bush in the party's presidential
primaries, was critical of the Republican winner for doing too
little to help GOP Senate candidates.
   ``We could have used a little help from the vice president in
some of the states _ Florida,'' Dole said. ``We pleaded with them to
go to Florida.''
   In Washington, former Republican Sen. Slade Gorton succeeded in
his comeback try despite strong opposition from Rep. Mike Lowry, a
liberal Democrat. Gorton will succeed Sen. Daniel Evans, who is
retiring.
   Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, one of the chamber's most
conservative members, withstood an unexpectedly strong challenge
from state Sen. John Vinich, a populist Democrat. With 99 percent of
the vote counted, Wallop led 89,388 to 88,504 _ easily the closest
outcome of the year's 33 Senate races.
   Vinich had accused Wallop of being out of touch with Wyoming's
economic problems.
   Millionaire Wisconsin businessman Herb Kohl, who spent millions
of dollars on his own race and declared his money gave him an
independence few could claim, defeated Susan Engeleiter, the GOP
leader in the State senate. Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., had held
the seat since 1957.
   In New Jersey, Democratic incumbent Frank Lautenberg withstood a
determined challenge by Republican Pete Dawkins, beating the former
Rhodes scholar, football star and Army brigadier general in what
many described as the nation's most negative campaign.
   Brushing aside the issues of his age and health, 80-year-old Sen.
Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., who underwent surgery in August for colon
cancer, defeated state House Republican leader Earl Strinden, 56, to
keep the seat he has held since 1960.
   In Virginia, former Democratic Gov. Charles Robb, the son-in-law
of the late President Lyndon B. Johnson, crushed black GOP candidate
Maurice Dawkins for the seat of retiring Republican Paul Trible.
Robb's reaction: ``How sweet it is.''
   In Nebraska, Republican Sen. David Karnes, who was appointed to
the job, was defeated by former Democratic Gov. Bob Kerrey who won
the Congressional Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War. Kerrey reacted
to victory by bursting into song, singing a rendition of Australia's
``Waltzing Matilda'' with its poignant words about a wounded soldier.
   ``Let's waltz tonight and begin work tomorrow,'' Kerrey said.
   In Nevada, Democratic Gov. Richard Bryan narrowly defeated
freshman GOP incumbent Chic Hecht after a seesaw battle. Hecht bore
the brunt of criticism accusing him of ineffectiveness in blocking
plans to locate a nuclear waste dump in the state.
   Ohio's Howard Metzenbaum, a liberal two-term Senate Democrat,
turned back a challenge by heavily financed Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., survived a strong challenge from
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy in the nation's most expensive
Senate race.
   Rep. James Jeffords, a moderate Republican who has been Vermont's
sole House member for the past 14 years, won easily in his bid to
claim the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Robert Stafford.
   In both parties, most incumbents easily won new terms.
   Democratic winners included Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who is
leaving his post as Democratic leader but will take over the
chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee; Kennedy, chairman of
the Labor and Human Resources Committee; Sen. George Mitchell,
D-Maine, one of three senators seeking to replace Byrd as Democratic
leader; Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Paul Sarbanes of Maryland; Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York; Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico; Donald
Riegle of Michigan; Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, and Spark Matsunaga
of Hawaii.
   Republican incumbents winning re-election included Sens. John
Heinz of Pennsylvania; Richard Lugar of Indiana; John Danforth of
Missouri; William Roth of Delaware; John Chafee of Rhode Island;
Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Minnesota's David Durenberger who defeated
state Attorney General Hubert ``Skip'' Humphrey, son of the former
senator, vice president and 1968 Democratic presidential candidate.

   A former Farm Bureau worker armed with two
rifles, a pistol and gasoline held 13 people hostage at a bureau
office but released them unharmed and surrendered today after being
told he could meet with a bureau executive.
   The gunman, identified as M.L. Shaw, walked into the Farm Bureau
office in this southern Mississippi town of 9,000 about 7 p.m.
Tuesday and freed the last of his hostages about 2:30 a.m. after
negotiations with two clergymen and the police chief, police said.
   ``They persuaded him he was going to have his hearing,'' Mayor
Steve Pittman said.
   ``I'm pleased it was handled where nobody was injured,'' he said.
``Obviously, after many hours he was obviously tired.''
   Seven men and a woman _ the bureau manager, the president and
members of the board of directors, the board secretary and the board
president's son _ were held for 7{ hours. Four hostages were
released earlier because of age and health problems. Another escaped
soon after Shaw walked into the Farm Bureau office brandishing his
weapons and carrying two 5-gallon containers of gasoline.
   During the siege, Shaw had the office secretary call authorities
on the telephone to relay his demands.
   Pittman said Shaw was never specific in his demands other than to
say he wanted to speak with a Farm Bureau executive.
   Anna Nixon, an employee of the bi-weekly Columbian Progress
newspaper, said one of four men released early on, Ed Kendrick, had
identified the man as a former manager of the Farm Bureau office.
   ``He is demanding seven years' back pay and that's the number of
years since the man apparently left the Farm Bureau,'' Nixon said.
   Police Chief Joe Sanders said Shaw, who lives in the Bunker Hill
community just outside of Columbia, had worked at the Farm Bureau
office for about 25 years, and left about seven years ago because of
his health.
   After the hostages were released, authorities escorted Shaw out
of the building to take him to meet with an official of the state
Farm Bureau's office who was en route from Ruleville, Pittman said.
   Authorities didn't say what charges, if any, would be filed
against Shaw.
   However, Sheriff Webbie McKenzie said Shaw would be taken to the
State Hospital at Whitfield, a mental hospital.

   West German Jews today led their
fellow citizens in a day of atonement on the 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, and hecklers jeered Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a
solemn ceremony.
   In Austria, Parliament observed a minute of silence for
Kristallnacht victims, and American Jewish activists re-enacted the
Nazi practice of forcing Vienna Jews to wash city streets with
toothbrushes.
   Israel's president, Chaim Herzog, said Kristallnacht laid the
groundwork for ``the tragedy of the Jewish people,'' and he urged
Israelis to work together to avoid a repeat of the tragedy.
   On the night of Nov. 9-10, 1938, Nazi thugs beat and murdered
Jews, ransacked their homes and businesses, and destroyed
synagogues. The rampage left city streets littered with glass _
hence the name Kristallnacht, which means Crystal Night in German.
   On the eve of Krstallnacht ceremonies, right-wing extremists
spray-painted swastikas and pro-Nazi slogans on a synagogue in a
small Bavarian village, police said. The incident occurred early
Tuesday in Binswangen, in southern West Germany.
   Jews objected to Kohl's presence at the Frankfurt ceremony,
citing his 1985 visit to the Bitburg cemetery where 49 Nazi SS
officers are buried, and his alleged insensitivity to Jewish
concerns.
   ``Mr. Chancellor, what about Bitburg!'' one of two hecklers in
the balcony of Frankfurt's West End synagogue shouted as Kohl spoke.
   ``Mr. Chancellor, why are you lying? We want our rights!'' both
men shouted.
   ``Let me finish,'' Kohl interjected.
   Other voices were heard from the main floor of the synagogue, but
it was not clear what they were shouting.
   ``Even today, the wounds of this conflagration are not fully
healed,'' said West Germany's Jewish community leader, Heinz
Galinski.
   Galinski, a 75-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz death camp,
delivered the main address in a service televised nationwide from
West End, the only synagogue in Frankfurt that was not destroyed on
Kristallnacht.
   The synagogue was badly damaged but has been completely
refurbished, with its stone walls, majestic pillars and sweeping
arches returned to their former splendor.
   West German police surrounded the building to guard against
possible attacks on the politicians, church representatives and
other guests inside.
   ``The younger generation _ just as we ourselves _ are always on
guard against a return of the indescribable,'' Galinski said.
   ``Remembering _ not forgetting _ must be our command, the command
for all,'' he said.
   An estimated 6 million Jews died during the Nazi Holocaust.
   Vienna's Parliament president, Leopold Gratz, said ordinary
Austrians who were ``rapacious anti-Semites'' or obsessed with the
``evil spirit of Nazism'' joined Nazis in the fearsome pogrom 50
years ago.
   In the shadow of Vienna's landmark St. Stephen's Cathedral, Rabbi
Avi Weiss, Glenn Richter and Bernie Glickman of the New York-based
``Coalition of Concern'' donned yellow stars like those the Nazis
forced Jews to wear.
   The three used a giant yellow toothbrush to rub away a ``Nazi
Waldheim'' slogan they scrawled on the sidewalk. Weiss said any
commemoration of Kristallnacht in Austria was ``false'' and ``form
without substance'' as long as Kurt Waldheim is president.
   Waldheim has been accused of participating in war crimes when he
served with the German army in the Balkans in World War II. He
denies the allegations.
   Israel's president, during a ceremony at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial, urged Israelis to maintain unity despite sharp
political disputes.
   ``We have to work together so this dark period will never return,
and that those who today follow in the path of the Nazis will not
reach their goal,'' he told about 200 people in Yad Vashem's Hall of
Remembrance, a bare room with an eternal flame and the names of
death camps imbedded in the floor.
   West German Justice Minister Hans Engelhard said 91 Jews were
murdered during the Kristallnacht porgram, while 267 synagogues were
destroyed. Generally accepted figures say about 7,500 Jewish
businesses were ransacked and 30,000 Jews were sent to concentration
camps.
   Communist East Germans also were marking Kristallnacht, with the
main ceremony scheduled in East Berlin, but President Horst
Sindermann has rejected responsibility for the Nazis' murder of the
Jews.
   For years, the East German government has argued that because it
only came into existence as a nation in 1949, it did not have a
legal responsibility for the atrocities of the Nazi regime.

   Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop won a third
term early today, but his margin over Democratic challenger John
Vinich was so slim that the votes may be recounted.
   George Bush easily carried Wyoming to take the state's three
electoral votes.
   State law calls for an automatic recount when votes are less than
1 percent apart. With all precincts reporting, Wallop had 90,330
votes, for 50 percent, and Vinich, a state senator, had 89,161
votes, also 50 percent.
   But still out were absentee ballots in Fremont County that were
being counted by hand.
   Wallop was optimistic he'd maintain a lead, but Vinich refused to
concede.
   ``I think we still have a chance. I don't figure it will be
determined for another week,'' Vinich said today in a telephone
interview from his home in Hudson. ``I think there's still a chance
of coming out on top.''
   In the presidential race, Republican Bush collected 105,858
votes, or 61 percent, while Democrat Michael Dukakis had 66,573, or
39 percent.
   The state's lone House seat was retained by Rep. Dick Cheney, a
Republican, who coasted to a sixth term over Democrat Bryan Sharratt.

   The Soviet Union said today that George Bush's
election shows that Americans support the Reagan administration's
arms control efforts, and that an early summit with the new
president is likely.
   ``Such summits have become normal phenomena in our relations,''
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told a briefing
when asked about a meeting between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   ``I can be absolutely confident that such summits would follow,
but I can't provide concrete information as to the next summit,'' he
said.
   ``We note with satisfaction that the American electorate express
their view with regard to the continuation of arms control
negotiations and for expanding cooperation between the U.S.A. and
the Soviets in all possible areas,'' Perfiliev said.
   The Soviets had not expressed a preference in the election, but
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said last week the
Soviets would like a prompt summit with whomever won.
   Correspondents of the official Tass news agency reported from
Washington that Bush's election victory over Democrat Michael
Dukakis showed Americans were satisfied with Reagan's economic
policies and pleased with his progress on arms control.
   They noted that Bush ``committed himself to the policy of the
current incumbent of the White House, Ronald Reagan.''
   Tass referred to the treaty signed in Washington in December by
Reagan and Gorbachev under which the superpowers agreed to eliminate
their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Negotiations toward a 50 percent cut in strategic weapons are
continuing, but slowed considerably as the Reagan administration
comes to a close and the American focus turned to selecting his
replacement.
   Tass said Bush also had campaigned on a platform calling for
negotiations with the Soviet Union from a position of strength
through strengthening NATO, and upgrading nuclear forces.
   Tass reported in a brief dispatch at 7:45 a.m. that Bush had won
the presidential election in the United States. The official media
reported more details of the election for the White House, Congress
and governorships throughout the day.
   Soviets who passed by the U.S. Embassy on the busy Garden Ring
Road stopped and looked at a pictoral display about Bush, including
a biography with the headline ``New President.''
   The afternoon daily Izvestia ran a front-page story about Bush's
victory headlined ``George Bush _ President of the U.S.A.,'' along
with his biography and a portrait.
   In its reports, official Radio Moscow said, ``The Soviet Union
proceeds from the understanding that a dialogue between the two
countries will be continued with a new administration in the
interests of nuclear disarmament and world peace.''
   It said observers noted that the election of Bush was decided
``first and foremost by the improvement in the national economy
which took place lately under the present administration, a
reduction of inflation and the number of jobless.''
   Radio Moscow said the Republicans successfully portrayed Dukakis
as a liberal who was weak on foreign policy.

   Employees at two small shipyards in Gdansk
called off strikes today after Solidarity leader Lech Walesa urged
workers to end protests against a government plan to close the Lenin
Shipyard.
   Several hundred workers gave up their strike and took down
banners at the Wisla Shipyard after receiving a promise that
employees who took part in the strike would not be fired, a strike
leader said.
   At the Repair Shipyard, 200 workers held a morning rally, then
ended their strike after several appeals by Walesa, strike
participants said.
   They also said they acted after management threatened to fire
them, and police arrived and tore down their signs at the yard
gates. ``We decided to leave because it made no sense to fight,''
said striker Krzysztof Kamolak.
   The strikes began Tuesday at the Wisla and Repair yards in this
Baltic port to protest the government's plan to close the nearby
Lenin Shipyard, bithplace of Solidarity, the outlawed free trade
union movement.
   On Tuesday night, workers at both yards defied an earlier appeal
by Walesa to end their strikes and stayed put overnight in
near-freezing weather.
   Last week, communist authorities said they were closing the Lenin
Shipyard Dec. 1 because it is losing money. Solidarity leaders said
the plan to close the shipyard was an attempt to cripple Solidarity
at a time the government says i wants to negotiate.
   Walesa, after meeting with the Lenin Shipyard management on
Tuesday, indicated he would not insist on an immediate reversal of
the closure plan before talks open with the government. He said he
was told at the meeting it could take two years or more to close the
yard.
   ``At first we had one month. Now we have two years,'' said
Walesa, an electrician at the yard and winner of the 1983 Nobel
Peace Prize.
   ``We will fight for it (the Lenin Shipyard) and we will save
it,'' he said. ``But the blade is not at our throats... We have time
and we can talk about the shipyard later.''
   Strike leaders said Tuesday that they were protesting both the
closure order and the delay of government-opposition talks on
Solidarity's future. Leaders of the movement are demanding its legal
reinstatement.
   ``This is a warning to the authorities that we want the
government to set about talks right away,'' said Jan Stanecki, a
protest leader at the Wisla yard, which has about 1,000 workers who
make yachts and river craft.
   He said 400 to 500 Wisla workers supported the strike. Some of
the strikers at the plant's gates huddled over fires roasting
sausages Tuesday night as police vans were posted at the entrances.
   About 150 strikers at the 4,500-worker Repair Shipyard, which
renovates ships, also vowed Tuesday night to stay off the job ``to
the end,'' according to one worker in a group standing at the gate.
   Through emissaries, Walesa urged the strikers to end the
protests. He said there was time to solve the Lenin Shipyard dispute
and strikes could hinder resolution of the issue of talks with the
government.
   But he also said that to improve the climate for the talks
officials must reinstate 100 coal miners in southern Poland fired
after strikes in August.
   The government promised the negotiations in exchange for Walesa's
help in ending those strikes, Poland's worst labor unrest in seven
years.
   But both sides have since disagreed on the agenda and the
government objects to longtime Solidarity advisers Adam Michnik and
Jacek Kuron as members of the opposition's delegations.
   Authorities told Walesa in August that Solidarity's future would
be on the agenda, along with broader issues of political and
economic reform.
   Poland's centrally planned economy is in disarray, with inflation
at 60 percent so far this year.
   Solidarity, the only free trade union movement ever allowed in
the Soviet bloc, was chartered by the government in 1980. It was
crushed in a December 1981 military crackdown and later outlawed.

   An Air Force F-15C fighter has disappeared
in low clouds and mountainous terrain, and a civilian reported
hearing explosions after seeing the jet fly over Kodiak Airport.
   The Air Force said the plane was presumed down.
   Ground and air search teams suspended their effort Tuesday night
because of low visibility and the treacherous terrain, said Coast
Guard Lt. Tom Saint.
   ``There have been no communications with it of any sort,'' Saint
said. ``We'll go out again at first light.''
   The plane was practicing instrument landing approaches at the
Kodiak Airport, the Air Force said. Weather at the time of the
aircraft's disappearance was six miles visibility but cloud cover
was only 1,200 feet, officials said.
   Gil Nyerges, a commuter pilot with Herman-MarkAir, said he heard
a jet approaching the airport.
   ``And I thought, `Gee whiz, I'd hate to be over the airport
moving toward the mountains right now because of the weather.'
   ``About that time, I looked up and saw a military jet ... I said
I hope this guy has enough altitude to clear Barometer Mountain
because it sits right at the end of the runway. Then I heard a loud
explosion followed by four or five popping noises.
   ``I ran inside in a big tizzy and nobody else heard it. There was
a lot of fog in the area, so I think that soaked up a lot of sound
and reverberation.''
   ``When I saw this fellow go overhead, he was on a course and at
an altitude that would have taken him into the mountain,'' Nyerges
said.
   ``There was speculation by a lot of people that what I heard
wasn't an explosion but an afterburner kicking in and the secondary
explosions were (engine) compressors not kicking in,'' he said.
   The plane was based at Elmendorf Air Force Base at Anchorage,
said Staff Sgt. David Haulbrook. The pilot's name was not released.
   More than 30 of the single-seat jets are assigned to the 21st
Tactical Fighter Wing at Elmendorf.
   Capt. Janice Mullan, a spokeswoman for the Alaskan Air Command,
said F-15s have been involved in at least four accidents in Alaska
from 1982 to 1985.

   California continued its ticket-splitting
politics, voting for Republicans George Bush and Pete Wilson for
president and U.S. Senate while re-electing Democratic majorities to
Congress.
   Voters also faced a bevy of ballot propositions.
   With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Bush had 4,643,372 votes,
or 52 percent, to Dukakis' 4,359,502 votes, or 48 percent. Bush won
California's 47 electoral votes _ the largest number of any state.
   Sen. Wilson garnered 4,722,437 votes, or 54 percent, for his
re-election victory to 3,981,271 votes, or 46 percent, won by his
Democratic challenger, Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy.
   Auto insurers, lawyers and consumer advocates waged a record $75
million media battle over five conflicting insurance-related ballot
measures.
   By a 3-1 margin, voters rejected a no-fault auto insurance
initiative. Voters also rejected three of the four other
propositions, including one that would limit attorney fees in
insurance cases. But a Ralph Nader-backed measure that would slash
rates by more than 20 percent was leading, 51 percent to 49 percent,
with 97 percent of the precincts reporting.
   A $15 million television campaign by the tobacco industry failed
to defeat a proposition to hike the state tax on cigarettes by 25
cents per pack, as voters approved the tax by a 16 percentage point
margin.
   By a 2-1 margin, voters rejected an emotionally charged AIDS
initiative that would have forced doctors to report AIDS patients in
order to trace everyone they might have infected. But voters
approved a referendum allowing AIDS testing for people accused of
certain crimes.
   Doubt lingered on some of the contests because of an unknown
number of absentee ballots.
   Voters approved $3.2 billion in education, water, prison, housing
and library bonds.
   California's 45 congressional races produced no change in the
current 27-18 Democratic majority in the state's U.S. House
delegation, as every congressional incumbent on the ballot was
re-elected. However, the delegation will have three new faces _ all
Republicans _ replacing two Republicans who retired and one who was
defeated in the June primary.

   Right-wing extremists
spray-painted swastikas and pro-Nazi slogans on a synagogue in a
Bavarian village on the eve of ceremonies marking the Kristallnacht
anniversary, police said today.
   The swastikas and words ``Heil Hitler'' were sprayed Tuesday on
the synagogue's outside wall in large letters with black paint,
police in Binswangen said.
   Binswangen is a small village in southern West Germany.
   Police said they removed the swastikas and Nazi slogan in time
for a 50th anniversary Kristallnacht ceremony in the synagogue today.
   The Binswangen synagogue was one of hundreds of Jewish houses of
worship attacked by Nazis on Nov. 9, 1938. The Moorish-style
synagogue was reconstructed after the war.
   Police said they had not identified any suspects.

<HEAD>Italy to Withdraw Naval Fleet from Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy will withdraw its naval task force from the
Persian Gulf by the end of the year, the government announced today.
   A communique issued after a meeting between Premier Ciriaco De
Mita and Defense Minister Valerio Zanone said the decision was taken
in view of ``the progressive consolidation of stability in the
area.''
   Other Western nations with fleets in the gulf were consulted
about the decision, the statement said.
   Italian frigates will stop escorting Italian merchant ships
through the waterway by the end of November and the entire fleet
will return home by Dec. 31, the communique said.
   Until then, exploration and anti-mine activities will continue,
the statement said.
   There are currently five Italian ships in the gulf, according to
the Naval Ministry.
   Italy sent its task force to the Persian Gulf in September 1987
to protect Italian commercial ships after an Italian freighter was
attacked by an Iranian speedboat. The task force originally
consisted of four frigates and four support ships.
   The fleet has been gradually scaled back as a result of reduced
tensions in the region. Italy withdrew one frigate in August
following the Iran-Iraq cease-fire agreement.
   The gulf war cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. No ship has been
attacked in the gulf since then and Iran has dramatically reduced
its interceptions of vessels.

   South Dakota dealt a victory for legalized gambling in Deadwood,
the Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down while
playing poker 112 years ago, and state lotteries won in Kentucky,
Indiana, Idaho and Minnesota.
   In South Dakota, voters Tuesday approved a constitutional
amendment that gave the Legislature the power to set rules and
regulations for legalized gambling in Deadwood. With 95 percent of
the precincts reporting, the measure was approved by 179,136 to
99,138 votes, or 64-36 percent.
   Deadwood voters ultimately would have to approve the idea by 60
percent.
   The plan would permit slot machine and card games, with proceeds
helping finance historic preservation in the town.
   In Kentucky, voters approved an amendment allowing a lottery by
61-39 percent. With all but three of the state's 3,228 precincts
reporting, 687,246 people voted to lift the constitutional ban on a
state lottery and 439,198 people voted against it.
   The vote was, ``victory for Kentucky's children, senior citizens
and Vietnam veterans,'' Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said during a
celebration in Tuesday night. He then asked the General Assembly to
enact legislation for a lottery during a special session beginning
Nov. 28.
   In Indiana, voters overwhelmingly approved a lottery amendment,
but opponents said they will continue to fight it.
   With 93 percent of precincts reporting early today, 62 percent of
voters were in favor of the proposition that would remove the state
constitution's ban on lotteries and other forms of gambling.
Thirty-eight percent were opposed.
   ``We're not finished,'' said Paul R. Oakes, chairman of Indiana
Citizens Against Legalized Gambling. ``The legislators still have to
approve a lottery. We're going to make a prediction that it's
possible in Indiana that we may have parimutuel horseracing and no
lottery.''
   Debate will begin in January as legislators decide how a lottery
will be run and how to spend the projected $150 million in annual
revenues.
   In Idaho, pro-lottery forces turned back an intense media drive
by well-financed opponents and narrowly won support for a
constitutional amendment authorizing a state-run lottery.
   ``We were under a barrage of media messages to the tune of
three-quarters of a million dollars,'' Idahoans for the Lottery
leader Larry LaRocco said.
   With all but five of the state's 875 precincts reporting, the
lottery had 210,532 votes, or 52 percent. Opponents garnered 196,268
votes, or 48 percent.
   ``We were pleased with the results when we went to bed,'' said
the Rev. Ken Wilde, chairman of the anti-lottery umbrella group
Consider. ``I suppose we'll rally our forces and consider what to do
next.''
   In Minnesota, a state lottery measure was approved by 1,205,858
votes, or 59 percent, to 835,256 votes, 41 percent.
   Since approval of a constitutional amendment requires a majority
of all voters who cast ballots, a 60 percent majority is generally
considered the minimum needed to ensure passage because large
numbers of voters traditionally skip the constitutional questions.
   The Legislature now must decide whether a lottery will actually
be established in Minnesota.

   Thousands of Americans and foreigners around the
world watched U.S. election returns early today at parties featuring
everything from hot dogs to a red, white and blue cocktail called a
Bushakis Fizz.
   From Hong Kong, Istanbul and Tel Aviv to Rome, Paris, Bonn and
London, the partisan and curious came to watch live television
coverage of Republican George Bush's defeat of Democrat Michael
Dukakis.
   ``I'm trying to find out the names of the candidates _ I gather
there's a Mr. Brush and a Greek gentleman,'' deadpanned British
comedian John Cleese, one of 1,500 guests at a bash at the U.S.
Embassy in London.
   Andrew Lloyd-Webber, composer of the hit musicals ``Cats'' and
``Phantom of the Opera,'' who was at the London embassy with his
wife, singer Sarah Brightman, said he was ``a Bush man.''
   ``But I must say, there's only one president of the United States
_ Mrs. Thatcher,'' he joked, referring to Britain's strong-willed
prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.
   As votes were being counted, it was breakfast in Hong Kong where
300 people gathered at the Furama Hotel over Danish pastries and
coffee, some holding American flags handed out by Boy Scouts.
   In Cairo, election results were broadcast live at 2 a.m.,
following a party at the Nile Hilton.
   Israeli TV also broadcast through the night _ interrupted by
thrillers and comedy series _ and the American Cultural Centers in
Jerusalem and Tel Aviv invited the public to a morning-after party
featuring live satellite coverage over coffee and cake.
   All-night election parties were held at the Minerva eating club
at Leiden University in The Netherlands and at hotels in Istanbul,
Ankara and Geneva, where dinner featured prime rib flown in from New
York and entertainment included Swiss yodelers and a country music
band.
   At the American Community Club in Bonn, several hundred people _
most of them Germans _ watched the returns, munched hot dogs, drank
beer and listened to a Dixieland band.
   ``We're talking pure Americana here,'' said Neal Walsh, spokesman
for the U.S. Embassy, which sponsored the party.
   Film director Franco Zeffirelli, fashion designer Renato Balestra
and Italian politicians were among more than 1,000 people at Rome's
Excelsior Hotel for a U.S. Embassy party.
   In Paris, the liveliest party was at Harry's New York Bar near
the Opera. Hundreds who couldn't get in spilled in to the Rue Daunou
and neighboring bars to watch election results on TV.
   ``It's surprising. You don't expect this overseas,'' said Roy
Cobleigh of Imperial, Calif., who is in the U.S. Navy and taking
advantage of shore leave of several weeks to tour Europe.
   ``People here are real knowledgeable. They know as much as we do
about American politics,'' said fellow sailor Kevin Lanpher of
Barry, Vt.
   Jim Mallen, 83, an American who said he participated in the
Normandy landings and liberation of Paris in World War II and has
lived in the city for the past 28 years, was at a quieter party at
Pershing Hall, the American Legion headquarters in Paris.
   ``I have voted for two Republicans in my life _ Reagan and
Bush,'' Mallen said. ``I feel Bush is going to keep my life the way
it is.''
   In London, Democrats and Republicans Abroad and a host of
organizations threw a party for 500 at the National Liberal Club
that featured an Uncle Sam greeter and the winner of an
election-night cocktail competition _ the Bushakis Fizz made from
blue liqueur, champagne and a maraschino cherry.
   Other cocktails in the competition included the Bush Charisma,
made from tap water but no ice, and the Quayle Ale, which consists
of any bottle beer.

<HEAD>Court Rules ID Cards Not Required In Pakistani Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a victory for the main opposition
party, a provincial court has ruled the government cannot force
people to show identity cards before voting in national elections
Nov. 16.
   The Lahore High Court ruled Tuesday that such cards are not
required by the constitution, which says the right to vote can only
be limited by a person's age, citizenship, residence and competency.
   ``No further qualification, conditions or limitations ... can be
put on his constitutional right or franchise by any subordinate
legislation,'' the court said. The federal government said it will
appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The Lahore court encouraged people to bring some form of
identification to polling places, where their names will be checked
against a list of registered voters.
   The main opposition Pakistan People's Party, which has a large
following among the poor, said during the three-day court hearing
that many lower-class people do not have identity cards and would
thus be barred from voting.
   Some women have identity cards but without the required
photographs because they come from strictly Moslem famlies that do
not allow women to be photographed, the party said.
   The government said the use of identity cards would reduce voter
fraud.
   Earlier this year, the Pakistan People's Party won another legal
victory when a court ruled that candidates can run affiliated with
political parties.
   The government had ordered they must run as individuals. People's
Party leader Benazir Bhutto said that order favored the governing
party.
   Ironically, it was Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who
as prime minister in 1973 demanded all Pakistanis carry an identity
card.
   He ruled until 1977 when Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq ousted him in a
coup. He was executed in 1979. Zia died in a plane crash Aug. 17
after calling the Nov. 16 general election. A government inquiry
found the plane was sabotaged, but the probe was unable to say
exactly how it was done or by whom.

<HEAD>Woman Becomes Living Heart Donor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A living woman's healthy heart has been
removed and transplanted into another patient, and the donor then
was given the heart and lungs of a girl who died in a fall.
   Doctors said Tuesday they decided to do a heart-lung transplant
on the St. Paul woman and give her heart to someone else rather than
replace just her damaged lungs because it is an easier operation.
   It is one of only a handful of such ``domino transplant''
procedures done since the first one at Johns Hopkins University
hospital in Baltimore 1{ years ago, said Dr. Robert Emery, head of
transplant surgery at Abbot Northwestern Hospital.
   ``The important thing is that the donor organs were used
maximally,'' said Emery. ``We kind of got two for one on this. The
second patient might have had to wait a long time, so the timing was
nice.''
   Late Sunday, doctors from Abbott Northwestern obtained the heart
and lungs of an unidentified brain-dead 17-year-old girl.
   Surgeons then removed the heart of Barbara Tremble, 28, of St.
Paul, and transplanted it into Eva Hallberg, 61, of Roseville, whose
heart had been badly damaged by several heart attacks.
   Tremble's lungs, left almost useless by cystic fibrosis, were
then removed and she was given the 17-year-old's heart and lungs.
   Tremble was in critical condition late Tuesday, breathing with
the help of a respirator. Emery said he expects her recovery to be
slow.
   Emery said Tremble knew her chances of surviving the operation
were only 50-50 because she had been weakened by cystic fibrosis, a
genetic disease that attacks the lungs, and by diabetes.
   Hallberg was reported in good condition Tuesday.
   Tremble transferred to Abbott Northwestern's transplant waiting
list several weeks ago because of a personnel shakeup in the
University of Minnesota's lung and heart-lung transplant program.
She had been on a waiting list at the university for about a year.
   Emery said doctors talked to Tremble about the possibility of
donating her heart to someone else well in advance of her surgery.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon held a
narrow lead today in Puerto Rico's gubernatorial elections, but
rival Baltasar Corrada del Rio refused to concede victory even as
late results showed it would be hard to catch up.
   Hernandez Colon favors the island's continued status as a
commonwealth, while Corrada del Rio supports statehood.
   ``Triumph is here. Victory is here,'' Hernandez Colon told
hundreds of cheering supporters outside party headquarters.
   But Corrada del Rio, the mayor of San Juan, said before official
counting was temporarily suspended that it was ``imprudent and
immature'' to call the race because not all results were in from his
strongholds of San Juan and the suburb of Bayamon.
   ``I will not accept that Hernandez Colon has won the election,''
he said.
   With results from 1,650 of 1,754 voting centers, official results
gave Hernandez Colon 853,013, or 48.7 percent; Corrada del Rio
802,438 votes, or 45.8 percent. An estimated 200,000 votes were
still out when official counting was suspended temporarily.
   First elected in 1972 and re-elected in 1984, Hernandez Colon,
51, wants wants Washington to grant Puerto Rico more autonomy in
immigration, foreign trade and labor matters.
   Corrada del Rio, 53, led an aggressive campaign and managed in
the last weeks to cut into Hernandez Colon's lead.

<HEAD>Red Cross Proposes POW Exchange This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said
today that it has proposed that Iran and Iraq begin releasing sick
and wounded prisoners on Nov. 20.
   The Red Cross said the exchange would include a total of 1,569
disabled prisoners captured by both sides during their 8-year-old
war.
   ``Technical talks are still under way to undertake the
exchange,'' Red Cross spokesman Juerg Bischof said. ``We have
proposed Nov. 20 as the starting date but we have not received a
formal answer from the two sides.''.
   Iraq announced Tuesday that it was ready to begin immediately
with the repatriation of sick and wounded Iranians the Red Cross has
identified in Iraqi camps, provided Iran also agrees to send home
disabled Iraqi POWs.
   Iran had said Oct. 21 that it was prepared to release the sick
and wounded ``should Iraq be willing to reciprocate.''
   Bischof said the Red Cross has registered 1,158 disabled Iraqi
POWs and 411 Iranians.
   In a note to both governments on Oct. 4, the agency encouraged
them to proceed with the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners,
and the registration of all prisoners, estimated to total more than
100,000, ``as a matter of priority.''
   Tehran and Baghdad described their offers to return the sick and
wounded as ``humanitarian'' initiatives. As signatories of the
Geneva conventions, both countries already were pledged to
repatriate them.
   The Red Cross has registered a total of 50,182 Iraqi POWs in Iran
and 19,284 Iranians in Iraq, but estimates that each side holds
another 20,000 to 30,000. It has urged both governments to supply
complete lists and insists that all prisoners be interviewed by Red
Cross delegates to make sure repatriation is voluntary.
   Reports in the Iranian press said that about 20,000 Iraqis want
to stay in Iran. About 2,500 Iraqis have torn up their Red
Cross-issued identity cards in front of Red Cross delegates. Iranian
POWs who publicly announced their opposition to the revolutionary
government may also be reluctant to accept repatriation.
   In the U.N.-mediated peace talks that began Aug. 25, five days
after the cease-fire took effect, Iraq has been pressing for the
release and repatriation of all POWs, independently from the
negotiations on consolidating the truce.
   Iran insists that such global release be linked to other
provisions in the U.N. cease-fire resolution 598. It urges that
priority be given to the withdrawal of forces to ``internationally
recognized borders.''
   That border is disputed since Iraq, a few days before the
outbreak of the war, repudiated a 1975 treaty delineating it. The
issue has stalled the peace talks since they began.

Montana</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th graf pvs, `The youngest ...' to CORRECT youngest

<TEXT>
   Voters ended 20-year control over the governor's office by
Republicans in Indiana and by Democrats in Montana, rejected GOP
Gov. Arch Moore's bid for a fourth term in West Virginia and
narrowly re-elected embattled Republicans in Utah and Rhode Island.
   The bottom line Tuesday: the Democrats registered a net gain of
one seat and hold 28 of the 50 governorships.
   Indiana's Evan Bayh was elected the nation's youngest governor at
age 32, and Moore was the only incumbent unseated as 12 states
elected governors. The Republicans retook only Montana, a seat being
vacated by a Democrat.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete overcame allegations of unethical conduct in
Rhode Island to defeat a Democratic businessman for the second time
in two years, while fellow Republican Norm Bangerter was re-elected
in Utah after trailing by wide margins in public opinion polls for
most of the campaign.
   GOP incumbents won more easily in Delaware, Missouri and North
Carolina; Democratic incumbents were returned by wide margins in
North Dakota, Vermont and Washington, and a new Republican replaced
an old one in New Hampshire.
   The governor's results in some cases seemed to bear little
relation to the presidential outcome. Bayh won despite a GOP
landslide for George Bush and Sen. Richard Lugar in vice
presidential candidate Dan Quayle's home state. A Republican won in
Rhode Island, where Democrat Michael Dukakis prevailed.
   The son of former Sen. Birch E. Bayh became Indiana's first
Democratic governor in 20 years by defeating Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz.
With 99 percent of the vote reported, Bayh received 1,107,327 votes
or 53 percent to Mutz's 989,699 votes or 47 percent.
   Bayh, Indiana's secretary of state, called his victory ``the
honor of a lifetime.''
   The youngest governor in office is Ray Mabus of Mississippi, who
was not up for re-election. He is 40.
   In financially ailing West Virginia, Democratic newcomer Gaston
Caperton, an insurance executive, denied Moore an unprecedented
fourth term. Caperton called the outcome ``a great victory for those
of us who want change.''
   With all precincts reporting, Caperton won with 382,639 votes or
59 percent to 267,943 votes or 41 percent for Moore.
   ``The people of West Virginia have been very kind over the years
to the Moore family in our public service. We believe as a family we
gave them our heart and soul and all the years of our service,''
Moore said in conceding.
   In Montana, former GOP state Sen. Stan Stephens wrecked a
comeback attempt by one-time Gov. Thomas Judge. With 98 percent of
the precincts reporting, Stephens received 183,893 votes or 53
percent to Judge's 163,175 or 47 percent.
   Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and three Democrats _ were on
the ballot. Indiana's Robert D. Orr was barred by law from a third
term; Montana Democrat Ted Schwinden and New Hampshire Republican
John Sununu are retiring.
   In Rhode Island, communications executive Bruce Sundlun had
raised questions about DiPrete's private business deals, alleged
favoritism in awarding of contracts and the hiring of the ex-wife of
a reputed mobster for a state job.
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, DiPrete received 195,283
votes or 51 percent to Sundlun's 188,984 votes or 49 percent.
   ``I know this has been a tough campaign on all of us, especially
on our families,'' the governor said. ``These past few months have
given me a renewed appreciation for your basic sense of fairness,
and you are a fair people.''
   The Sundlun campaign said it would seek a recount; approximately
16,000 absentee ballots remained to be counted.
   Utah's Bangerter, stigmatized by a record $166 million tax
increase, battled back from a 30-point deficit in the polls and
reached Election Day in a tight race against Democrat Ted Wilson,

<HEAD>Moslems Appoint Acting Army Commander</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moslem half of Lebanon's dual
government appointed a new commander of the Lebanese army even
though Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian prime minister, still holds
the post.
   Adel Osseiran, defense minister in the Moslem Cabinet, announced
the appointment today of Moslem Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib as acting
commander of the Lebanese army.
   But with Aoun still claiming the post, the move could hasten the
disintegration of the 42,000-member regular army along religious
lines and solidify Lebanon's partition into sectarian territories
after 13 years of civil war.
   Osseiran told reporters in Moslem west Beirut that the post of
the army commander ``is considered vacant because the original
commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, has taken up other duties.''
   Asked whether his move means the Lebanese army will have two
rival commanders, Osseiran said: ``Khatib is appointed in an acting
capacity. Gen. Aoun is the original commander. He has the right to
return to his post once his other duties are over.''
   Aoun, a Maronite Christian, was named prime minister of a
caretaker military cabinet by President Amin Gemayel when his term
expired Sept. 23. Gemayel's decree stipulated that Aoun would also
retain his post as army commander.
   But Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions rejected Aoun's
premiership, charging it violated a 1943 unwritten national covenant
that gave the premier's post to Sunni Moslems, the presidency to
Maronites and the parliament speaker's position to Shiite Moslems.
   They pledged allegiance to the government of Sunni Moslem Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, which ruled under Gemayel.
   Lebanon's parliament has been unable to meet to elect a successor
to Gemayel.
   Aoun, who considers the Hoss Cabinet and its decisions
illegitimate, made no immediate comment on Osseiran's decision.
   But the Lebanese Front, the coalition of Christian groups opposed
to Syria's military presence in Lebanon, rejected Khatib's
appointment.
   ``This appointment is illegitimate because it comes from an
illegitimate authority,'' the Front said in a statement.
   Khatib, 55, a retired Sunni officer, announced his acceptance of
the new post, saying ``I shall exercise this job in a way that will
serve the unity of the army and the country.''
   In reality, however, Khatib will have authority over five
predominantly Moslem army brigades stationed in Moslem-controlled
areas.
   Five other brigades stationed in the Christian heartland north
and northeast of Beirut remain under Aoun's control.
   Khatib had served as figurehead commander of the all-Syrian Arab
Deterrant Force, which intervened in Lebanon at the behest of the
Arab League in 1976 with a mandate to end Lebanon's civil war.

   Washington voters gave Michael Dukakis a slim
majority, overwhelmingly endorsed a second term for Democratic Gov.
Booth Gardner over an evangelical conservative, and awarded Slade
Gorton a Senate comeback.
   With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Dukakis had 844,554
votes, or 51 percent, to George Bush's 800,182 votes, or 49 percent.
   Gardner had 1,055,467 votes, or 63 percent, to 628,006 votes, or
37 percent, for Republican challenger Bob Williams, a conservative
whose populist campaign never caught on with voters.
   Republican Gorton vindicated his 1986 defeat by Democratic Sen.
Brock Adams by beating liberal Democratic Rep. Mike Lowry. Gorton
will replace retiring Republican Sen. Dan Evans.
   Gorton had 840,017 votes, or 51 percent, to 814,873 votes, or 49
percent, for Lowry.
   The state's U.S. House delegation remained at five Democrats,
including Majority Leader Tom Foley of Spokane, and three
Republicans.
   Two open U.S. House seats were filled by Democrats. State Rep.
Jolene Unsoeld won the 3rd District seat, and Jim McDermott, a child
psychiatrist and former chairman of the state Senate Ways and Means
Committee, captured Lowry's 7th District seat.
   Voters approved a ballot measure backed by environmentalists to
create a state Superfund to clean up toxic waste dumps, rejecting a
weaker version boosted by business and enacted by the Legislature.
   Voters also overwhelming approved a measure to hike the state
minimum wage to $3.85 an hour as of Jan. 1 and $4.25 a year later.
The current state minimum wage, $2.35 an hour, covers employers such
as some small businesses not covered by the federal minimum wage of
$3.35 an hour.

   A soldier opened fire with an automatic
rifle inside a mosque at a military base, killed an undetermined
number of worshipers and committed suicide, the Defense Ministry
said today.
   The ministry said the shootings occurred Tuesday night at an air
base near Jessore, 85 miles southwest of Dhaka.
   ``Some casualties among the devotees occurred as a result of the
indiscriminate firing without any apparent reason,'' the ministry
said. It said the attacker shot himself to death immediately after
shooting the worshipers.
   Unconfirmed reports said eight to 10 people, mostly air force
personnel, died.
   The assailant was only identified as being an air force man. His
name was not disclosed.
   Witnesses in Dhaka said a funeral was held in the capital today
for some ``uniformed personnel.''

   Rockers Billy Idol, Julian Lennon and other
friends of a disc jockey killed by a hit-and-run driver staged a
tribute concert to raise an additional $10,000 in reward money for
leads to the killer.
   Lee Selwyn, 26, was riding his motorcycle last month when he was
run down by a motorist in a pickup truck. He died Oct. 8.
   ``They've got to catch a guy like that who might be doing it to

   Friends have offered a $10,000 reward for information, and they
hoped to at least to double that amount once the books on Tuesday's
concert at the Palace nightclub are closed.
   ``He was a very sweet, a very wonderful man,'' said Lennon.
   ``He was a very nice guy,'' added Idol who, with Lennon and five
local bands performed for a sold-out audience.
   Idol said he and Selwyn shared a common bond of music and a
fascination with motorcycles, riding for fun in groups that often
included celebrities.
   Selwyn spun records at such trendy Los Angeles nightclubs as
Durango, Angel City, and Le Hot Club. On Oct. 5, he opened his own
club, Triple X.
   ``There was big, big excitement,'' recalled business partner
Robert Kalafut. ``It was our baby. It worked out great. Everything

   A senior PLO official today pledged to do ``all we
can'' to gain the release of Terry Anderson, the longest-held
hostage in Lebanon.
   Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the PLO's political department, said the
organization supports efforts to free Anderson, 41, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press.
   Kaddoumi, known as the foreign minister of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, spoke to the Foreign Correspondents' Club
of Japan. Anderson was a member of the club when he worked in the
Tokyo AP bureau before his assignment to Lebanon.
   He was kidnapped in Lebanon on March 16, 1985 and is one of 14
foreigners, including nine Americans, held hostage.
   Asked whether the PLO could help, Kaddoumi said the PLO was
``ready to do all we can do in order to release Mr. Anderson, and
make sure also I will present this to the Palestinian ledership ...
to do their utmost effort in order to release Mr. Anderson.''
   The PLO, however, has little influence over the pro-Iranian
Islamic Jihad group that is holding Anderson.
   Islamic Jihad released a statement Friday accusing the United
States of delaying the release of hostages by reneging on ``pledges

<TEXT>
   Two-term Democratic U.S. Sen. John Melcher
lost to a Republican county commissioner and Republicans captured
the Montana governor's mansion after 20 years of Democratic control.
   Republican George Bush won the state's four electoral votes.
   Conrad Burns, a commissioner from Montana's most populous county
which includes Billings, became the first GOP senator from Montana
in 36 years.
   Burns said taxes and the Montana wilderness bill sponsored by
Melcher but vetoed last week by President Reagan were keys to his
victory Tuesday.
   ``The 101st Congress is really going to have to knuckle down and
go to work on this deficit,'' he said.
   Melcher said he'd only been campaigning for about 18 days and ``I
never really had a good feel for the race.''
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Burns had 184,789, or
52 percent, and Melcher, 170,149, or 48 percent.
   In the governor's race, Republican Stan Stephens, a former state
senator, defeated former Democrat Gov. Tom Judge, who was seeking
his third term after losing in his party's primary eight years ago
to retiring Gov. Ted Schwinden.
   ``I'd like to think we won the contest because people realize we
represent change,'' said Stephens, a Canadian immigrant who came to
Montana to harvest wheat 39 years ago.
   Stephens had 185,256 votes, 53 percent, to Judge's 164,111 votes,
47 percent.
   Bush collected 185,688 for 53 percent, Democrat Michael Dukakis
had 163,507 for 47 percent.
   Montana's two congressmen, a Republican and a Democrat, were
re-elected.

   A razor-thin margin of several thousand votes out of
nearly 3.8 million cast separated Democrat Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay
and Republican Connie Mack III in Florida's U.S. Senate race.
   ``We're a long way from being finished,'' Dot Joyce, state
supervisor of elections, said today.
   The race could hinge on an estimated 100,000 absentee ballots,
she said. The final tally was expected later today, subject to
recount.
   ``We'll just have to wait it out,'' MacKay said today.
   Mack, 48, the conservative grandson of the Hall of Fame baseball
manager, hoped to follow George Bush's smashing triumph. Bush swept
61 percent of the vote to claim Florida's 21 electoral votes.
   The Senate race pitted two congressmen trying to succeed
three-term incumbent U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles. With 99 percent of
precincts reporting unofficial returns, MacKay had 1,953,753 votes,
or 50 percent, to Mack's 1,949,715 votes, also 50 percent.
   ``It looks like I'm winning. I'll be comfortable declaring myself
the winner when all the votes are counted,'' MacKay, 55, said after
midnight.
   ``We're not stopping now,'' Mack vowed.
   The presidential race was never in doubt. Bush became the eighth
Republican in the last 10 elections to carry Florida, getting
2,500,313 votes, or 61 percent, to 1,615,193 votes, or 39 percent,
for Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   The Democrats lost MacKay's 6th District seat when businessman
Cliff Stearns, 47, beat state House Speaker Jon Mills, 41.
   Former state Senate President Harry Johnston, a Democrat, won the
14th District seat vacated by five-term Democratic Rep. Dan Mica,
who also ran for the Senate. Johnston defeated hardware magnate Ken
Adams.
   Mack's 13th District seat was won by Republican Porter Goss over
Democratic civil rights activist Jack Conway.
   Incumbent Democrat William Chappell was in a close race against
Republican attorney Craig James, 47, for the 4th District seat
Chappell has held 20 years. Chappell, 66, chairs the House Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee.

   California voters approved deep cuts in car insurance rates
despite a record $60 million campaign against the measure, while
Maryland upheld a landmark ban on cheap guns and abortion foes won
major victories in Michigan, Colorado and Arkansas.
   In other election results, California voters overwhelmingly
rejected an emotionally charged AIDS initiative that would have
forced doctors to report AIDS patients in order to trace everyone
they might possibly have infected. However, they also approved a
referendum allowing AIDS testing for people accused of certain
crimes.
   Massachusetts and Nebraska residents Tuesday gave votes of
confidence to nuclear power; the tax revolt suffered setbacks in
Colorado and Utah. Oregonians rejected what would have been the
nation's toughest anti-smoking law, while Californians approved a
25-cent increase in cigarette taxes with the proceeds used to
promote health. Florida, Colorado and Arizona made English their
official state language. New Yorkers approved a record $3 billion
borrowing to repair roads.
   In all, voters in 41 states faced 238 statewide ballot questions
_ 29 in California alone.
   In California, where auto insurers, lawyers and consumer
advocates waged a record $75 million media battle over five
conflicting insurance-related ballot measures, voters rejected four
of those propositions.
   A Ralph Nader-backed measure that would slash rates by more than
20 percent was narrowly approved by 51.2 percent to 48.8 percent.
The vote on that measure was 4,528,783 to 4,320,205 with nearly 98.9
percent of the precincts reporting.
   The AIDS measure that would have forced California doctors to
report the identities of AIDS sufferers was defeated by 66-34
percent with 93 percent of the precincts reporting. The plan was
backed by tax rebel Paul Gann, who contracted acquired immune
defiency syndrome in 1982 from a blood transfusion.
   The other AIDS measure, which won by 62-38 percent, is designed
to help protect rape victims and law officers who fear they may have
been exposed to AIDS or other communicable diseases.
   In Maryland, the state's 6-month-old law that bans cheap handguns
known as ``Saturday night specials'' won by 58-42 percent despite a
more than $4 million media campaign by the National Rifle
Association, which feared it will encourage gun control elsewhere.
   In Michigan, voters approved a ban on state-financed abortions
for poor women except to save the life of the mother. With 84
percent of the precincts reporting, the ban won by 58-42 percent.
   Coloradans likewise voted against state-funded abortions, by
60-40 percent. An Arkansas amendment that protects life beginning at
conception and forbids state-financed abortions was approved by a
52-48 percent margin, with 96 percent of the precincts reporting.
   In Massachusetts, voters rejected an initiative that would have
shut the state's two nuclear power plants. With 79 percent of the
precincts reporting, 68 percent voted against the plan that was
opposed by Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Nebraskans decided against becoming the first state to withdraw
from an interstate nuclear waste compact.
   Among the more stringent tax-cutting measures, South Dakotans
rejected Proposition II, which would have rolled back property taxes
and limit future increases, by 61-39 percent.
   Coloradans defeated a ``Taxpayers Bill of Rights Amendment,''
which would have cut income taxes about 10 percent, limit property
taxes and require voter approval on future hikes except in
emergencies. The measure lost, 58 percent to 42 percent.
   In Utah, voters overwhelmingly rejected three tax initiatives
that together would have lowered state and local revenues by $329
million. The measures would have limited property taxes, rolled back
income, sales, gasoline and cigarette taxes, and granted tax credits
for private education.
   Nevadans overwhelmingly approved a constitutional prohibition on
income taxes. The measure, backed by the casino industry, was
approved 83 percent to 17 percent.
   A ``Fair Tax Amendment'' that would have made it easier for the
Arkansas legislature to raise certain taxes failed 62-38 percent
with 96 percent of the precincts reporting.
   Oregon voters rejected an ordinance that would have banned
smoking in most public places. The measure was defeated by 61-39
percent.
   But 58 percent of California voters endorsed a 25-cent hike in
the cigarette tax, with 93 percent of the vote counted. Proceeds of
the tax would go toward promoting health.
   In Florida, 84 percent of voters decided to declare English the
official state language. Coloradans endorsed a similar amendment by
a 61-39 percent margin with 99 percent of the precincts reporting.
The vote was closer in Arizona, where it was approved 51-49 percent
with 97 percent of the precincts counted.
   Oregonians overturned Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's order protecting
homosexual state workers from discrimination by a 53-47 percent
margin. Fort Collins, Colo., voters rejected a proposed gay rights
initiative by 56-43 percent, with 67 of 164 precincts counted.
   State lotteries were approved in Kentucky, Indiana, Idaho and
Minnesota.
   South Dakota voters approved a measure legalizing gambling in
Deadwood, a Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok died playing
poker and where townspeople are now eager for money to preserve
wild-west architecture. The measure won 64-36 percent.
   A Massachusetts initiative aimed at protecting farm animals from
cruelty was trounced by a 71-29 percent margin, with 79 percent of
the precincts reporting.
   South Dakotans were endorsing a ban on corporate hog farming by a
62-38 percent margin.
   In other major contests:
   _ Florida residents rejected an amendment limiting liability
claims for bodily injury to $100,000 for non-economic losses such as
pain and suffering.
   _ A South Dakota measure requiring strip miners to restore land
to original contours where possible was defeated by a 59-41 percent
margin. Kentucky residents strongly endorsed a measure restricting
strip-mining rights. With 99 percent of precincts reporting, the
vote was 868,634 yes, 192,240 against.
   _ Montanans rejected a repeal of the state's year-old seat belt
law, while Oregon voters rejected a new seat belt ordinance.
   Montana rejected a measure that would have made the state the
10th to enact a ``bottle bill'' requiring return deposits on
beverage containers.
   _ Washington voters chose between two rival measures dealing with
hazardous waste disposal. Voters approved a toxic waste initiative
drafted by environmentalists over one drafted by big business and
favored by state leaders. The margin was 55 percent to 45 percent,
with 88 percent of the precincts reporting.
   _ Californians approved a proposal requiring restoration of funds
for the state's Occupational Safety and Health Agency, which was
dismantled last year by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.
   In local contests, residents of Cape Cod, Mass., approved limits
on development, and two dozen California communities considered
similar curbs.
   Cambridge, Mass., approved a referendum supporting Palestinian
rights and demanding Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, but another college town, Berkeley Calif., rejected a measure
that would have established a sister-city relationship with a
Palestinian refugee district in the Gaza Strip.

America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY GIBBS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NORMAN, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An archaeologist says he has dug up
primitive tools that suggest humans lived in North America 13,500
years earlier than the date commonly accepted by scientists.
   Don Wyckoff, director of the Oklahoma Archaeological Survey, said
Tuesday he is convinced his preliminary dating is accurate, but that
expensive testing is needed to prove the age of the tools unearthed
along with bison bones at a site near Alva in September.
   Carbon-dating tests on the bones were inconclusive, but Wyckoff
said the same test on snail shells found at the same level indicates
an age of 25,000 years.
   Based on current evidence, scientists have thought that ancient
humans first lived in North America about 11,000 to 11,500 years ago.
   Experts say carbon-testing on snail shells can be inaccurate
because snails incorporate old carbon molecules in their shells.
   ``These are the kind of dates that often turn out to be
inaccurately old,'' said Donald Grayson, professor of archaeology at
the University of Washington.
   Wyckoff acknowleges the problem, but said he is confident that
the discovery 30 miles west of Alva in northwest Oklahoma will prove
to be the oldest evidence of human inhabitation of North America.
   ``I feel pretty comfortable about the whole thing. The geological
context is good. I look at this location and I say it's got to be
old,'' Wyckoff said.
   The state agency he heads is affiliated with the University of
Oklahoma and uses its students for research and field work.
   Wyckoff reported on his initial findings last weekend at a
meeting of the Plains Anthropological Conference in Wichita, Kan.
   He said a resident came across bones in June 1986 while digging a
pond, and called the archaeological survey.
   A University of Kansas archaeologist, Larry Martin, who was
visiting at the time, recognized the skull of an ancient bison.
   ``We really weren't thinking that the site had anything to do
with people. We were just looking to get a look at what Oklahoma
looked like in the Ice Age,'' Wyckoff said.
   After more than a year of tedious sifting of dirt from the site,
the archaeologists turned up two flakes identified as debris from
resharpening of a stone tool.
   They then tried radiocarbon dating on the bones, but when that
didn't work, ``out of desperation we submitted a group of aquatic
snails that were present around the bison skull,'' Wyckoff said.
   The test, completed in October 1987, showed they were 31,150
years old _ give or take 700 years.
   Wyckoff said he allows another 20 percent for possible carbon
contamination to come up with the age of about 25,000 years.
   ``It would be very rare for a snail shell to be more than 20
percent contaminated,'' he said.
   The National Geographic Society turned them down for funding to
do the expensive accelerator dating, saying the few flakes were not
evidence enough of a human site.
   ``So we just decided we'll get a bunch of volunteers, go back up
and dig a few more squares. We did that in September, and recovered
a good broken tool as well as part of another tool and more
flakes,'' Wyckoff said.
   Wyckoff said it costs $600 a sample for testing by accelerator
dating, based on extracting specific proteins from tiny amounts of
material.
   Meanwhile, Wyckoff said he is awaiting the results, expected by
week's end, of another dating test based on the presence of uranium
thorium in the bison teeth.
   The Southern Methodist University doctoral student conducting
that test said that while his results aren't complete yet, ``he felt
like ... it was going to be fairly compatible with our'' age of
25,000 years, Wyckoff said.
   If so, he said it would be the most important archaeological find
in the last 60 years.
   ``If it is that old, it would be that important,'' said Grayson,
the Washington archaeologist.
   ``There's good reason to believe people were here earlier but we
haven't proved that yet,'' Grayson said.

<HEAD>Police Find Valuable Steiner in Raid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The violin was made in 1676 by Austrian
Jakob Steiner. It may be as valuable as a Stradivarius. And it was
left behind by burglars in a run-down apartment raided by police.
   Police believe the violin was stolen from the home of a family
that has owned it for five generations and values it at $800,000.
   Detective Tom Ryan said Tuesday he found the violin as he
searched an apartment in neighboring Daytona Beach for jewelry, guns
and other items taken in a string of house burglaries in the last
two weeks here and in adjoining Ormond Beach.
   Two men arrested last week tipped off police to the apartment,
which they said also had been used by two other men as a stash house
for stolen property. Ryan said he suspects the other men took the
violin in an Oct. 20 burglary.
   Violins made by Steiner, who died in 1683, may be even rarer than
those of the Italian Antonio Stradivari because Steiner made fewer
of them, according to some collectors.
   According to library records, Stradivari made about 650 violins.
   The series of about 18 burglaries netted the crooks between
$35,000 and $50,000 in jewelry and guns, police said.
   The two arrested, Jason Lee Signore, 18, and Edward Revas, 20,
were picked up in an unrelated burglary, detectives said.

<TEXT>
   A flash fire that killed an infant undergoing
heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center was not linked to the
fact the surgery took place outside an operating room, health
officials ruled.
   ``There is no reason to believe that this incident would have
been any different had it taken place ... in an operating room,''
said Robert Karp, program manager for health facilities at the Los
Angeles County Department of Health.
   However, Karp said health officials are studying whether such
future procedures should be limited to approved operating rooms.
   The Oct. 6 fire at Cedars-Sinai took place in a patient care room
while doctors were attempting to close a small vessel between the
15-day-old baby's pulmonary artery and aorta, major blood vessels
near the heart.
   It was believed caused when a small electric cauterizer, used to
seal off blood vessels, emitted a spark that ignited something in
the room's oxygen-rich atmosphere.
   Hospital officials said the same surgical team had performed the
operation safely dozens of times. They characterized the fire as a
freak accident.
   Health Services officials said they were surprised to learn the
operation was not performed in an operating room. Hospital officials
responded that many medical facilities perform such surgeries
outside operating rooms and that they had permission to use the room
for surgery.

<TEXT>
   A man who fathered 13 children with three of his
daughters has pleaded guilty to sexual assault and indecency with
those children, the last of several charges pending against him.
   Lewis Charles Elliott, 53, had been scheduled to stand trial
Tuesday on one of the remaining charges when his attorney, Pat
Robertson, and prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement.
   Elliott, of Dallas, was sentenced to 20 years on seven charges of
indecency with a child and three of aggravated sexual assault, and
forfeited parental rights under terms of the agreement.
   ``He got to talk to the family and say goodbye to all of them,''
Robertson said. ``This takes care of all the other 10 cases and he
gets to appeal his 50-year case.''
   Last week, Elliott was sentenced to 50 years in prison following
his conviction of sexual assault involving one of the children.
   Last year, Elliott was assessed 10 years in prison after pleading
guilty to three charges of incest involving the three daughters.
   The children range in age from 1 to 8, and the mothers are
between 25 and 30, authorities said.
   Assistant District Attorney Lynne Ann Cartsunis said she and
fellow prosecutor Dorothy Reid accepted the plea agreement because
Elliott was willing to forfeit his paternal rights, saving them that
extra legal step.
   ``We were concerned about the children, having to put all those
children through one trial after another,'' Ms. Cartsunis said. ``We
wanted to let the family get on with their lives without him.''
   Ms. Cartsunis called the 50-year sentence for a man of Elliott's
age ``just short of a life sentence.''

<TEXT>
   A disappointed Lloyd Bentsen, returned by
the voters to the U.S. Senate, says he'll work to help George Bush,
but he's offering no apologies for the losing campaign he waged for
the White House with Michael Dukakis.
   ``He and I waged a campaign that's worthy of the American
people,'' said the Democratic vice presidential candidate, who often
criticized vice president George Bush for running on lies and
distortions.
   Surrounded by family as he addressed supporters at the historic
Driskill Hotel, where Lyndon Johnson watched his national elections
in 1960 and 1964, the Texas senator's voice cracked from the strain
of near-marathon campaigning in the final days.
   ``We told you the truth and we stepped up to those issues. We
challenged America to do better,'' he said. ``We fought fair, and we
never quit. And we never lost our faith in the truth _ that's what
you need in a campaign,'' he said.
   Bentsen called off plans for a morning news conference and went
to see a doctor because he lost his voice, spokeswoman Ellen
Moskowitz said today. He planned to return to Washington later in
the day.
   Unlike Johnson in 1960, Bentsen was unable to deliver his home
state of Texas for his Massachusetts running mate.
   During the campaign, Bentsen sometimes was critical of Dukakis
for failing to respond sooner to GOP attacks on his character and
record. But Bentsen had kind words as he ended his campaign.
   ``I have never seen a candidate that worked any harder. Or in
those last three or four weeks delivered a message any stronger than
did Mike Dukakis in those closing days.
   ``And he made me proud to be his partner,'' he said. ``He made me
proud to be his running mate and he made me proud to be an
American.''
   Bentsen's voice was nearly gone by the time he spoke later at a
party for his campaign workers. He struck a note of conciliation
toward the Republican victors.
   ``I'm committed to help George Bush,'' said the chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee. ``I think the time for partisanship comes
at elections.''
   Under an unusual Texas law, Bentsen ran for both the Senate and
the vice presidency. He claimed victory in his Senate race, which he
won handily over Rep. Beau Boulter, R-Texas.
   Jack DeVore, Bentsen's long-time Senate spokesman, said the
election results were bittersweet.
   ``On the one hand, there's gratitude to the people of Texas. On
the other hand, there's not,'' he said.

   About 1,800 county jail inmates were evacuated
when a fire started by a welder's torch erupted in a seventh-floor
narcotics evidence room at the Hall of Justice.
   No one was seriously injured, but 30 firefighters and six
sheriff's employees were sent to hospitals Tuesday for precautionary
exams because of exposure to the smoke, said Fire Department
spokesman Dean Kathey.
   Sheriff Sherman Block said narcotics, particularly cocaine,
burned in the 45-minute blaze.
   There was concern that runoff water might have been contaminated
by material stored in the 20-by-30-foot room, said fire spokesman
Greg Acevedo.
   At the height of the fire, smoke poured from the roof of the
13-story building, which has cells on the six upper floors.
   The prisoners were escorted by deputies and court bailiffs
through underground tunnels to the Criminal Courts Building. They
were then transported to other lockups, officials said.

<HEAD>Democrats Retain Control Of Most State Legislatures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrats retained their control of most state legislatures, but
Republicans made small inroads as the parties looked ahead to the
battle over redistricting that will follow the 1990 census.
   GOP state legislators did not do nearly as well as in the
previous two presidential elections. In 1980 the Democrats lost 302
seats and 10 chambers, and in 1984 they lost 330 seats and seven
chambers.
   ``We would obviously have liked to pick up some more seats,''
said Molly Gaylord, a field director of the Republican National
Committee. She said she hoped Republicans would pick up more seats
in 1990, the last elections before the legislatures' redistricting
battles of 1991.
   Based on early results of Tuesday's voting, Republicans picked up
roughly 16 to 30 seats in state legislatures, according to the
Republican National Committee.
   Republicans lost control of the New Mexico Senate to Democrats,
but took control of the Montana Senate, which had been Democratic,
the committee said.
   Republicans split evenly with Democrats in three houses that had
been Democratic, the committee said: the Oregon House and the
Vermont House and Senate.
   Democrats strengthened majorities in the legislatures of at least
five states, gained in the Republican-dominated houses of New York
and in Indiana _ Vice President-elect Dan Quayle's home state _ and
retained control in Southern strongholds.
   ``We're doing extremely well,'' said Timothy Dickson, a
strategist in the Democratic State Legislative Leaders Association.
``This points out George Bush not only doesn't have coattails, he
doesn't have any coat.''
   The Democrats control two-thirds of all state legislative
chambers. But the makeup of the legislatures is especially important
this year because it is the last election before the 1990 census,
which will be used to redraw congressional districts.
   Much of the power in influencing how those districts are
reshaped, which can result in lost seats for either political party,
lies in the statehouses.
   In New Mexico, voters ousted five Republicans, giving the
Democrats a 26-16 majority and stripping Republican Gov. Garrey
Carruthers of the only legislative advantage he has had the first
half of his term.
   In Ohio, where Democrats lost a seat in each house, strengthening
the Republican control of the Senate to 19-14 and weakening the
Democrat majority in the House to 59-40.
   ``First of all, we obviously got a boost from George Bush running
well. Second of all, we got a real boost from (Michael) Dukakis
picking Lloyd Bentsen,'' said James Tilling, the chief GOP
strategist in Ohio. He referred to the decision to pass over popular
Ohio Sen. John Glenn as a vice presidential candidate.
   In Iowa, Democrats held a 29-21 Senate majority and a 58-42 House
majority over Republicans prior to the elections. Late returns
showed Democrats were virtually assured of holding those margins and
possibly strengthening leads.
   The Rhode Island Senate was 38-12 Democrat and now will be 41-9
Democrat. The House was 80-20 Democrat and will be 83-17 Democrat.
   In Kentucky, which went solidly for Bush, Republicans lost one
seat each in the Senate and House. The new Democratic majorities are
30-8 in the Senate and 72-28 in the House.
   Democrats easily retained control of Connecticut's General
Assembly. Incomplete returns showed Republicans gaining just three
seats _ two in the House and one in the Senate _ compared with the
average of 23 seats the GOP has picked up in previous presidential
election years since 1968.
   Among Southern states, the Democrats maintained or strengthened
dominance in the Mississippi, South Carolina and West Virginia
statehouses.
   In North Carolina, Republicans toppled nine incumbent House
Democrats and picked up at least one Senate seat. That narrowed the
Democrat advantage in the House from 84-36 to 71-45 and in the
Senate from 40-10 to 39-11.
   The Democrats' advantage also shrank slightly in Georgia, from
46-10 to 44-9 in the Senate and from 151-29 to 138-29 in the House,
with several races still undecided.
   Likewise in Arkansas, the Democrats lost a few House seats but
still retained dominance with an 88-11 majority. The House balance
of 31 Democrats and four Republicans was unchanged.
   In Delaware, unofficial returns showed Senate Democrats
apparently retained their 13-seat majority over the eight
Republicans, while in the House, Republican control of 22-19
increased by three, giving the GOP 25-16 advantage.
   In Illinois, Democrats held on to control of both chambers of the
General Assembly. They have a 67-51 majority in the House and a
31-28 majority in the Senate.
   In Texas, Democrats remain in firm control despite losing a
Senate seat. The Democratic majority is 24-7. In the House,
Democrats have a 94-56 edge, the same count as before the election.
   In Nevada, Democrats picked up a seat in the Nevada Assembly and
have a 30-12 edge in the lower house. Republicans increased their
control of the Senate to 13-8 by gaining one seat.
   Arizona Republicans lost a net of two state Senate seats and two
House seats but appeared to have retained control of both chambers,
where they have held majorities since 1974.

   The cruise ship Song of America was forced to return
to port after an engine seized up and started a small fire, but no
one was hurt, the ship's owner said today.
   The ship left Miami on Sunday with about 1,300 passengers on a
Caribbean cruise.
   On Tuesday, a few hours out of Cozumel, Mexico, one of its four
engines seized up, touching off a fire in the engine room, said
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line spokesman Rich Steck.
   ``Any time you have a fire it's a big deal, but it was quickly
brought under control,'' Steck said. The passengers were mustered on
deck while crew members doused the blaze, but then allowed to resume
the evening's activities, he said.
   The 705-foot ship turned around and returned to Cozumel on its
remaining three engines to replenish firefighting supplies, Steck
said. Passengers stayed aboard, and the Song of America will return
to Miami on Thursday or Friday.
   All passengers will be offered early flights home, along with
full refunds or the chance to book another cruise, Steck said.

   World leaders congratulated George Bush on his
presidential triumph with a series of positive reactions that cut
broadly across party and ideological divisions.
   The Soviets said they expected they could work with Bush.
   European and Japanese leaders looked forward to continuity of
U.S. policy set by President Reagan.
   Israel and Egypt welcomed Bush's victory and the Palestine
Liberation Organization hoped Bush would champion Palestinian
aspirations to statehood.
   Nicaraguan and Costa Rican leaders expressed some optimism, but a
pro-government newspaper in Managua chided the Bush win.
   In many countries, local radio and television stations carried
results and live broadcasts through the night.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, asked in
a telephone interview whether a summit was likely early in the Bush
administration, replied: ``Yes, it is quite possible in my view _
quite possible.''
   Another ministry spokesman, Vadim Perfiliev, told a news briefing
in Moscow, ``We note with satisfaction that the American electorate
express their view with regard to the continuation of arms control
negotiations and for expanding cooperation between the U.S.A. and
the Soviets in all possible areas.''
   In China, where Bush had served as U.S. ambassador, the official
news agency said the president-elect ``boasts a rich experience in
public service unmatched by most of his predecessors.'' The Foreign
Ministry cabled ``our warm congratulations'' and hoped Bush would
help U.S.-Chinese relations develop ``in a stable and healthy
manner.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, senior stateswoman
of the Western alliance, stayed up all night watching results on
television and pledged her country's ``staunch support'' for Bush.
   She came to the doorstep of her residence at No. 10 Downing
Street, telling reporters she ``wanted to be among the first to
congratulate him.''
   ``I believe the same positive policies (of Reagan) will continue,
so I think that we can look forward to the same close relationship
that we've had in the past,'' the conservative prime minister said.
   In Nicaragua, where U.S.-supported rebels are fighting the
government, El Nuevo Diario quoted President Daniel Ortega as saying
the Bush administration could pave the way for talks and improved
relations.
   The same newspaper announced the Bush victory with the proverb,
``a one-eyed man is king in a country of the blind.''
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica said he expected full support
from Bush in implementing his Central American peace plan.
   ``Bush was my guest in August 1986, when he visited Costa Rica.
In that period, we talked about the peace plan for Central America
and he agreed that we must seek a peaceful solution to the crisis in
our region. ... I expect big support from Bush for our plan, because
we do not believe in war.''
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said his socialist
government sent congratulations, and he told French radio that Bush
``is serious, a hard worker with a lot of experience in foreign
affairs. He's very attentive to Europe and has a good relationship
with President (Francois) Mitterrand.''
   Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac, a former conservative premier,
cabled: ``Mr. President, my dear George, bravo for this magnificent
victory, which for my part I never doubted.''
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, whose controversial World War
II service in Hitler's army led the U.S. Justice Department to place
him on a watchlist of undesireable aliens, sent best wishes to Bush.
   He expressed his conviction that Bush's administration would use
``its great humanitarian abilities and means, not only for the
American people, but also for all of humanity, so as to contribute
to the maintenance and the continuation of peace and freedom in the
world.''
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry statement expressed confidence that
``Japan-U.S. relations will be further strengthened and developed in
the new era.''
   President P.W. Botha of South Africa cabled Bush his hopes that
U.S.-South African relations would be ``strengthened on the basis of
mutual respect and understanding.''
   State Radio South Africa editorialized that ``there will once
again be a president in the United States who is opposed to further
sanctions against South Africa.''
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino said she hoped Bush's
leadership ``will set up another milestone'' in U.S.-Philippines
relations.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said he did not expect
major changes in U.S. policy. ``I know Mr. Bush as a full-blooded
internationalist and as an accessible man.''
   Denmark's conservative prime minister, Poul Schlueter, said he
had met Bush several times and found him ``a highly perceptive and
competent statesman.''
   Norway's socialist prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, cabled
Bush: ``The U.S.A. is our most important ally. Together we shall
continue work for peace and to improve the context of peace. We must
continue cooperation to reduce the world's economical, political and
social dividing lines.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel said he expected Bush to
launch a new Mideast peace initiative, while Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir was said by a spokesman to be ``confident and hopeful that
the excellent ties with the United States will continue as they are
now.''
   Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, Butros Ghali,
said: ``Egyptian diplomacy welcomes the election of George Bush. ...
Egypt hopes he will succeed in efforts to bring peace and stability
to the world, particularly the Middle East.''
   Farouk Kaddoumi, the PLO's foreign policy chief, noted that U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz had recently modified his position
and put more emphasis on Palestinian political rights.
   Kaddoumi, in Tokyo on a visit, said: ``I hope Mr. Bush will
further this statement.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle paid a visit to
his transition office today, saying he's anxious to sit down with
George Bush and ``start things rolling'' for a new administration.
   Looking relaxed, but somewhat tired after a long Election Day,
Quayle traveled to a four-story white townhouse facing Lafayette
Park, across the street from the White House.
   Chatting briefly with reporters as he left his home in suburban
McLean, Va., the senator said his aim was to get started
``assembling thoughts, conversing with people.''
   But he said he had no specific tasks planned at the transition
office. A source close to Quayle, who declined to be named publicly,
said that Dan Evans, an Indianapolis lawyer and friend who managed
Quayle's 1980 Senate campaign, had been picked to head up the
transition office.
   On his arrival at the transition office, Quayle was asked to
describe his first order of business. ``Get organized,'' he replied.
Asked whether that would be difficult, he said, ``a cinch.''
   On Tuesday night, Quayle vowed to be a ``devoted public servant''
and said that he won't worry about changing his image to please
those with lingering doubts.
   Showered with affection from some 4,000 Republicans jammed into a
hotel ballroom on Election Night, Quayle basked in the glory, but
emphasized that he was eager ``to fall behind'' President-elect
George Bush.
   Quayle's selection last August surprised many political experts,
and the senator immediately encountered problems stemming from his
youth, his stumbles during interviews and questions about his
military and academic background.
   Through the election campaign, various public opinion polls
showed that the 41-year-old senator was a drag on the Republican
ticket. Quayle said Tuesday that a strong Bush-Quayle victory would
represent ``a vindication'' of Bush's judgment in selecting him.
   Quayle planned to greet Bush later on when the vice president
arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. The pair was expected to meet
with President Reagan at the White House.
   Quayle said he hoped Americans would ``give me a chance'' to
prove himself, but said he could not let himself be preoccupied with
people's perceptions of him.
   ``If, in fact, I was concerned about shaping or reshaping my
image, I'm going into probably the worst office to do that, and
that's being the vice president of the country,'' he said. ``The
vice president submerges himself and implements the policies of the
president. That becomes your sole goal and your challenge in your
job.''
   During an informal chat before the polls closed, Quayle said he
had not given any thought to whom he would name as his transition
director. He said he felt that would be ``putting us ahead of
ourselves.''
   But at least two of Quayle's key campaign lieutenants _ former
White House political director Mitchell Daniels and issues adviser
Jim Cicconi _ are leaving to return to private law practice.
   Chief spokesman David Prosperi said he did not know whether he
would remain in the new administration. Two other aides,
speechwriter Kenneth Khachigian of California and scheduler Lanny
Wiles, were brought in from California and Florida, respectively,
and are believed ready to go back.
   Other questions hover over the new vice president-elect. Quayle
must resign his Senate seat, and the senator has indicated he will
do that well before Indiana Democratic Gov.-elect Evan Bayh is sworn
in next January. Quayle has not said precisely when he would step
down, however.
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, also have been questioned
repeatedly about reports that Mrs. Quayle would accept an
appointment to serve out the unfilled term of her husband. Neither
has been willing to discuss a prospect that has Indiana political
leaders engaging in rampant speculation, although Quayle said last
week that ``it's (Gov.) Bob Orr's decision to make.''
   Quayle's triumphant appearance in the chandeliered ballroom of
the Washington Hilton hotel climaxed a checkered campaign for the
vice presidency, which started the day after the Republican National
Convention with an extraordinary, no-holds-barred
question-and-answer session with reporters covering his homecoming
appearance in Huntington, Ind.
   The senator was questioned repeatedly about indications he may
have used family influences to get into the Indiana National Guard
and avoid combat at the height of the Vietnam War. Quayle also faced
questions about his academic performance at DePauw University and
the circumstances under which he was admitted to law school with an
undergraduate grade average of ``C.''
   Although public opinion polls showed a large degree of anxiety
over Quayle, even up to Election Day, they evidently did not figure
very much into the results.
   Quayle surmounted his tough period in late August and early
September, and his latest Huntington homecoming, on Election Day,
was a more festive occasion. Townspeople turned out in droves,
elementary school children marched at the senator's side and sang,
cheering and clapping along the way through the downtown.

   President-elect George Bush turned to an old
tennis partner and long-time political ally, James A. Baker III, for
the chief foreign policy job in the new Republican administration.
   At his first news conference as president-elect, Bush announced
this morning that he would nominate Baker, his campaign chairman, as
secretary of state. The appointment had been widely expected.
   The partnership between Bush and Baker dates back to 1970, when
Bush asked Baker, still grieving over the death of his first wife,
to help him in his run, albeit unsuccessful, for the Senate from
Texas. From that evolved an 18-year political alliance.
   A prized photo that Baker keeps on his office wall tells the
story. Underneath a smiling portrait of Bush is the autograph,
``What would we do without real friends?''
   Bush told reporters today that Baker had ``distinguished himself
in every position he has held in the Reagan administration.''
   Baker served as chief of staff during the first four years of the
Reagan administration and then in a celebrated job switch took over
the Treasury post in 1985 when former Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan became chief of staff.
   Baker resigned from the Cabinet in August to take over as Bush's
presidential campaign chairman. He was succeeded at Treasury by
Nicholas Brady, who is widely expected to retain that post in a Bush
administration.
   The vice president revealed no other Cabinet choices at his first
press conference since winning the election.
   Bush saluted Secretary of State George Shultz for giving the
country the ``highest possible standards of public service'' during
his tenure at the State Department.
   Shultz in turn saluted the man designated to succeed him.
   At a Washington news conference, Shultz said Baker ``will hit the
ground running.''
   ``His close, warm and productive relationship with
President-elect Bush makes him just the guy to serve as the
president's chief foreign policy adviser, and as chief spokesman for
the president and for our nation's interests in the new and bright
era we have entered,'' Shultz said.
   While Baker is chiefly known for his skills in negotiating deals
with Congress, Bush cited his experience in foreign affairs gained
as a member of the National Security Council during the Reagan
administration.
   ``His 7{ years as a member of the National Security Council, his
proven skills as a negotiator and the personal respect in which he
is held will allow him again to demonstrate the highest standards of
performance as our next secretary of state,'' Bush said.
   In making the announcement, Bush said that he had encouraged
Baker, then a Houston attorney, to first come to Washington to serve
as undersecretary of Commerce in the Ford administration.
   Baker headed up his friend's losing presidential campaign in 1980
just as 10 years earlier he had been campaign chairman in Bush's
losing bid for a Senate seat in Texas, a race won by Democrat Lloyd
Bentsen.
   The Senate race marked the first time Baker had dabbled in
politics, taking time out from a successful corporate law practice
to help his friend and tennis partner at the Houston Country Club.
   Bitten by the political bug, Baker, then a Democrat, became a
Republican at Bush's urging and their careers have been intertwined
every since.
   At Treasury, Baker amassed more influence than any other recent
holder of that Cabinet post.
   Baker was credited with steering the 1986 tax-overhaul bill
through Congress, just as he had maneuvered the Reagan tax cut
through a Democratic Congress in 1981 as chief of staff.
   Baker won plaudits internationally for persuading U.S. allies to
coordinate their economic policies in a managed effort to devalue
the dollar, an effort widely credited with dramatically improving
the fortunes of U.S. industry by making their goods competitive once
again on overseas markets.
   However, Baker achieved less success with the so-called Baker
plan, an effort announced three years ago to solve the Third World
debt crisis by providing more loans to countries willing to adopt
free-market programs.
   Despite the new initiative, the $1.2 trillion debt burden of poor
countries remains as intractable as ever.
   Still, Baker has a reputation as one of the Republican Party's
craftiest political strategists.
   Many Baker admirers claims that some of the problems afflicting
the Reagan administration over the past few years _ including the
Iran-contra arms sales _ might not have happened had Baker remained
on as chief of staff, with his immense attention for detail.
   Both Baker, 58, and Bush, six years his senior, came from wealthy
families. Both went to prep schools in the East and both graduated
from Ivy League Colleges _ Baker from Princeton and Bush from Yale.

   An insurance reform measure backed by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader that sharply cuts California auto premiums was
narrowly approved today.
   With nearly 98.9 percent of precincts reporting, Proposition 103
won by 51.2 percent to 48.8 percent.
   Proposition 103, one of five ballot issues on California ballots
dealing with car insurance, lowers almost all rates by an immediate
20 percent below November 1987 rates. It requires an additional 20
percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers.
   The Nader-backed measure also gives an elected insurance
commissioner control over future rate increases, limits use of
territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subjects the
industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws.
   Also Tuesday, voters rejected industry-backed alternatives as
well as a measure supported by trial lawyers.
   The insurance industry mounted an unprecedented $60 million
campaign, but apparently was unable to persuade voters to back its
measure creating no-fault insurance.
   The industry's no-fault initiative, Proposition 104, was
trounced, getting just 25 percent yes votes to 75 percent against.
   ``This isn't over yet,'' said Proposition 103 author Harvey
Rosenfield. ``The fact the insurance and trial lawyers' measures
failed is an indication that people are sick and tired of special
interests meddling with the initiative process.''
   Proposition 100, the initiative sponsored by consumer groups and
trial lawyers that would have given good drivers a 20 percent car
insurance discount, was soundly rejected with 41 percent yes votes
to 59 percent no.
   Proposition 101, a measure sponsored by a Democratic assemblyman
and an independent insurance company to cut the bodily injury
portion of auto insurance rates, was defeated in a landslide with 13
percent yes votes to 87 percent no votes.
   Insurers' Proposition 106, which would have limited trial
lawyers' contingency fees, had 47 percent voting yes to 53 percent
no.

   Here is the text of President-elect George Bush's
news conference Wednesday.
   Thank you all. Good morning, and I hope everybody had a good
night's sleep. I did not. I have a relatively short opening
statement, and then I'd be delighted to take your questions.
   Let me say at the outset, once again as I did last night, how
thankful I am for the help and support of our family, of our
president, of my running mate and his family, and all those who
worked so hard on this long campaign, and particularly the American
people. I also want to thank Martin Van Buren for paving the way.
It's been a long time, Marty.
   Let me also add a word of thanks to you in the press,
particularly those in our traveling squad. We've had a bump in the
road here and there, and differences, but that's natural. And I know
_ I think _ as a result of this, the last couple of years, better
than most Americans, how hard you must work and the dedication that
it requires, and how much the health of our whole system depends on
that, depends on that dedication. You may not know it, but you
who've traveled with us are going to miss (campaign aides) Alixe
Reed and Bruce Zanca. It's a little early, but I know you will.
   We've just come from a church service at our home parish, St.
Martin's Church, and I've just begun, as a result of that, or just
prior to that to think about the task ahead, and I am certain that
God's help is absolutely essential for anyone chosen to lead this
great country of ours.
   To my opponents, again _ our opponents _ I offer my
congratulations for a hard-fought campaign. Both the governor and
Senator Bentsen have given a major portion of their own lives to
public service, and I have the greatest respect for that commitment,
and I know that each one is going to serve the public interest as
they see it with the same energy and conviction that they
demonstrated so well in this campaign. The very real differences
between have been highlighted by the glare of the television lights.
But for my part, I've never had any doubt that we share a common
interest in building a better America. And that's fundamentally what
the American election is all about.
   Now, just a few comments on the business of transition. I'm
pleased to announce the following initial set of appointments.
   I've asked my current chief of staff, Craig Fuller, and my senior
campaign advisor, Bob Teeter, to serve as co-directors of the
Bush-Quayle transition. Working closely with them will be the
counsel to the vice president, Boyden Gray, who will serve as the
transition's legal adviser and will be my general counsel in the
White House. My former executive assistant and secretary of the
Navy, Chase Untermeyer, who will serve as the transition's personnel
director, and I expect him to continue that after the transition.
And campaign Press Secretary Sheila Tate will now serve as the press
secretary of the transition.
   The transition organization will of necessity grow over time, but
it is nevertheless my intention to return to the tradition of a
somewhat leaner transition organization than we had in 1980, just
given the nature of what has to be done. I've asked my friends Bobby
Holt of Midland, Texas, and Penny Corth of Washington to co-chair
the Inaugural Committee, and they've generously agreed to serve.
   And today I can inform you of my first decision regarding my
Cabinet. I talked to Secretary of State George Shultz this morning,
and he told me that he enthusiastically endorsed my choice for the
next Secretary of State. George Shultz has given a great deal of
extraordinary service to this country, a distinguished career. And
he's given us the highest possible standards for public service, and
he has helped our president achieve many foreign policy successess.
And I salute him.
   As his successor, it is my intention to name James A. Baker III.
I first persuaded Jim Baker to leave Houston and come to Washington
many years ago in the Ford administration when he first came up to
the Commerce Department. And since then, he has distinguished
himself in every position that he has held. In the Reagan
administration, he set a new standard of excellence in his our-year
tenure as White House chief of staff and then over three years as
secretary of the Treasury in that experience. His 7{ years as a
member of the National Security Council, his proven skills as a
negotiator and the personal respect in which he is held will allow
him again to demonstrate the highest standards of performance as our
next secretary of state.
   He has big shoes to fill but will get the job done. And I know he
feels, as I do, about the distinguished men and women in our Foreign
Service. He will lead them and he will work constructively with them
to achieve our foreign policy objectives. In these coming months,
Jim Baker will not only prepare for his responsibilities, but he'll
also serve as an adviser to me on key aspects of the transition.
   That said, on the subject of appointments, I note the obvious.
President Reagan is still the president of the United States, and I
will not be using the transition to try to make or unduly influence
decisions that are properly the president's. And, rather, I will be
using the transition to assemble the very best possible team to meet
the challenges that lie before us, while also doing what I can to
help bring us together after this long and difficult campaign.
   As I said in the campaign, I will, for the most part, bring in a
brand new team of people from across the country, and in my view
that will reinvigorate the process. It will in no way reflect lack
of confidence in those who have served President Reagan so well.
After this press conference, we head back to Washington, D.C., for a
day or two, and then probably on Friday morning, I will head South
for perhaps four days and nights, and then back to Washington. I'll
be glad to respond to questions. Gene?

<HEAD>HOUSTON: questions. Gene?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. Vice President, last night, when you celebrated your
victory here in Houston, you spoke of reaching out to all Americans,
including those who did not support your candidacy. Other than
simply calling for unity, what specifically do you intend to do to
achieve it?
   And, secondly, how do you intend to approach Congress'
cooperation you will need, after spending so much of your campaign
bashing the Congress?
   A: Well, I think the way to heal is to have meetings with various
people, maybe those who have not supported us, make very clear
through this forum, and others, that I mean what I said, and the
American people are wonderful when it comes to understanding when a
campaign ends and the work of business begins.
   I don't think I was particularly in a ``Congress bashing'' mode
for the most of the campaign, but I will _ I have my principles, the
American people, in voting for me, voted for certain things.
   Congress understands that, and I understand the Congress. I've
served in the Congress. And so, I don't think it will be _ you know,
that they'll do everything my way, and _ but I will try very hard
because I start with a great respect for the institution in which I
serve. Yeah, Terry?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, what kind of job will you give Dan Quayle
in your administration? Will he have the same access to the _ all
the papers that you saw from President Reagan? And will he _ if you
could just describe what he would be able to _ what he'll do.
   A. I haven't formulated in detail, but certainly he will have
access to the papers, access to the intelligence, access to the
information because it is essential that a vice president be up to
speed on every sensitive matter involving the government lest
something happen to the president. These two, right on the aisle.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, a lot of people said in 1980 President
Reagan was able to really accomplish objectives in his first term
because he had a game plan that he moved swiftly on in the first 90
days. Will you have a game plan, and, if so, sir, can you give us
some sense of what it will be?
   A. I will have a game plan. Part of what the transition is about
is to spell out the priorities. I spelled them out in broad terms,
in terms of keeping the economic expansion going, and in terms of
world peace, but the election ended yesterday.
   We will now have 70-whatever days it is to formulate a game plan
, a first 100 days' priorities, if you will, and they'll be
specific, and I will do my level best to fulfill my commitments to
the American people. Dave?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, in your campaign, you laid out a very
ambitious agenda to deal with the Soviet Union _ eliminate chemical
and biological weapons, conventional weapons, finish the work on
strategic arms. Can any of this go forward as long as the Soviets
delay their withdrawal from Afghanistan? Do you see any linkage
between your plans, looking ahead, and the reality?
   A. I would not throw any firm linkage there but, clearly, one of
the things I've addressed myself to in this campaign is the need for
continued reduction of regional tension. And if the Soviets made a
determination not to pull out of Afghanistan, which I doubt they
will do, that would throw a complicating factor over the whole
relationship. I believe that the Soviets will keep their commitment.
Yes, Saul, and then Britt.
   Q. You said a few days ago, but haven't mentioned since, that
you're going to be trying to seek an early meeting with Mr.
Gorbachev. Now that you've named Jim Baker, do you expect that he
will begin at some point soon to try to seek that meeting?
   A. Not before January 20th. And I said would _ I would have the
secretary meet with the NATO leaders _ his counterparts in NATO, and
that then he would meet with Mr. Shevardnadze, and that then he
would make clear to the Soviets that I would be willing to meet with
Mr. Gorbachev and that is about the way _ but, I don't think, Saul,
that would start, you know, before the president _ before I become
president of the United States.

   An Air Force bomber pilot was hailed as a
hero for maneuvering his burning B-1B away from houses and trailer
parks and into the cow pasture where it crashed after all four
crewmen bailed out.
   The crash in west Texas on Tuesday afternoon was the third since
B-1 aircraft began flying four years ago as America's first
long-range bomber in more than 25 years. Four crewmen died in the
earlier accidents.
   The $204 million aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff for a
routine training flight from Dyess Air Force Base, where 29 B-1Bs
are based, Air Force officials said.
   Three crewmen bailed out, then Capt. Michael E. Waters turned the
smoking four-engine aircraft toward an unpopulated area and flew
about a half-mile before ejecting, Air Force spokewoman Maj. Beth
Kilgore said today.
   ``In my mind, what that pilot did was not only save the lives of
his crew but the lives of civilians in the area,'' said Walter
Gilstrap, who drove a pickup truck though fields to rescue the men.
   The pilot avoided a sparsely populated area of farm houses and
trailer parks eight miles west of Abilene.
   ``He rode it out for as long as he could and set it down where no
one would be hurt,'' said Gilstrap. ``They ought to give that man a
Distinguished Flying Cross.''
   The Air Force set up a roadblock to seal off the site and would
not speculate on the cause of the crash. Military investigators
intended to examine the wreckage today, said Air Force spokeswoman
Beverly Foster.
   The wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles,
said Al Dostal, another Air Force spokesman.
   Waters and his crewmates _ Capt. George M. Gover; Capt. Charles
M. Zarza, offensive systems operator; and 1st Lt. Anton Eret Jr.,
defensive systems operator _ were all in good condition today at the
base hospital, said Air Force spokeswoman Linda Gellnere.
   The plane was flying about two miles north of Interstate 20 near
Tye when smoke spewed from its left engine, said witness Lou Paulsen.
   ``At first there was just a puff of smoke, then fire,'' Paulsen
said. ``It looked like it started to go out, then it flared up big.''
   Gilstrap said he was near the Tye Truck Stop, where he has a
knife-sharpening stand, when people around him started yelling about
a plane on fire.
   ``I looked out the window and saw three parachutes and I knew
what was happening,'' he said. ``So I got in the truck and drove _ I
kind of had the coordinates figured out _ I drove to where I thought
they would be.''
   Gilstrap found the three crewmen scattered about one field and
the pilot a half-mile away in a different pasture.
   ``They were all in shock,'' Gilstrap said. ``They hugged me and I
hugged them and two of them asked me to call their wives.''
   Gilstrap said there were flames in the field where he found the
crewmen, but not close enough to burn them. Other witnesses said
flames from the crash rose 10 stories into the air, and smoke was
seen 20 miles away.
   In all, 100 aircraft in the B-1 series have been built.
   The B-1Bs were built at a cost of $204.1 million apiece in 1987.
They are intended to be the mainstay of the U.S. bombing force, able
to penetrate well-defended enemy territory in a nuclear war.
   On Sept. 28, 1987, another Dyess-based B-1B crashed at a training
range in Colorado when the jet, built by Rockwell International
Corp., ran into a flock of migrating birds at 600 feet. Three
crewmen died.
   Since that accident, the Air Force has budgeted $40 million to
make the B-1B less vulnerable to birds by adding deflectors near
sensitive hydraulic equipment.
   In August 1984, one of four prototype models designated B-1A
crashed at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., killing one man and
injuring two others.

   Q. Mr. Vice President, a subject dear to the hearts of
conservatives, but less dear to the hearts of Democrats in Congress,
in Democrats who still control Congress, is aid, military aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   You have supported it consistently throughout your campaign, yet
you didn't emphasize it consistently throughout your campaign. How
high a priority will aid to the Contras be in a Bush administration?
   A. It will have a high priority because freedom and democracy in
this hemisphere has a high priority, and I know these leaders in
this hemisphere. I can't say I know Daniel Ortega that well, but I
met him a time or two.
   And I will press to keep the pressure on the Sandinistas to keep
their commitment to the Organization of American States, the
commitment being one to democracy and freedom. Yeah, Lisa?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you spoke during the campaign about your
desire to eradicate bigotry, yet you campaigned hardly at all in
black neighborhoods and didn't receive very many black votes.
   Specifically, what are you prepared to do to assure these
Americans that the next four years will not be a continuation of the
last eight? And what would you try to do to reduce the number of
racial incidents that have occurred in recent years?
   A. Well, I hope I didn't understand the question properly because
if you suggest the last eight have been eight years of bigotry, I
just don't agree with that. I will do everything I possibly can.
That's not legislative necessarily. It's using the bully pulpit of
the White House to speak out against the kinds of incidents you're
talking about.
   But, when you look back at the history of the United States of
America, I think there are far fewer incidents that build on bigotry
than there have been. But, I would certainly do my level best to
make very clear from that White House that bigotry has no place in
America.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, let me follow up on a story on the
question about the summit. When Jim Baker talks to Soviets, is he
going to place any conditions on terms for you meeting with
President Gorbachev, or will you strictly get together with him for
a get-together _ get-acquainted session in the first 100 days or six
months?
   A. I am acquainted. I'm acquainted with him. And what I want to
do is see progress. And so, I would have the secretary of state do
exactly what I've said, that there's no _ I've never supported
meetings just for the sake of having a meeting. I want some progress
to take place, but it doesn't have to be progress on START or on one
category or another.
   We have arms control; we have human rights; we have regional
differences. And I can see reasons to talk about any provided
there's reason to believe there will be progress. I would like to
see my secretary of state continue that which George Shultz has done
in terms of the numbers of meetings with the Soviet foreign
minister. I think that's been very, very helpful. Jesse?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, how are you going to communicate with the
American people? You're a person who writes notes all the time, and
you like to telephone all the time. But with the demand on your time
as president, how are you going to talk to the people?
   A. Reach out and touch someone, use a telephone. And I'm not
going to change in terms of my belief that the more personal contact
you have, the better. I recognize there's _ the parameters of this
job are quite different, but I will continue to do what I've done in
terms of contact. And I'm one who works with _ closely with the
people that I've, you know, associated with on my staff, not just
one person I talk to. I will continue, just by way of example, what
I've been doing as vice president, and in terms of being briefed
directly by the Central Intelligence Agency every single day. It's a
little bit of a departure, but that's the way I'm going to do it,
and it puts me in contact more with the experts. But I'll try to
keep touch as best I can. Ann?

   President Reagan, described as satisfied that
he did ``all he could'' to help George Bush to his election victory,
directed his staff today to begin working immediately on the
transition to the new administration.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president
designated his chief of staff, Kenneth N. Duberstein, to head a
transition team that is expected to hold its first meeting with
representatives of the president-elect on Thursday.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, planned planned a public greeting for
Bush and his wife, Barbara, in the Rose Garden late today, followed
by a private meeting of the two men in the Oval Office to discuss
the transition and other issues.
   Fitzwater said Mrs. Reagan telephoned Mrs. Bush Tuesday night,
shortly after Reagan called the vice president, to express her best
wishes. He said he believed Reagan also planned to call
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the losing Democratic
presidential candidate.
   Asked whether Reagan believes he made the difference for Bush in
California or other states where he campaigned, Fitzwater said, ``I
think the president feels that he did all he could. I know he is
gratified by the California victory. That was very close when we
went there.''
   Aides named to serve with Duberstein on the transition team were
Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser;
M.B. Oglesby, his deputy chief of staff; A.B. Culvahouse, the White
House counsel, and John Tuck, director of the office of chief of
staff.
   Fitzwater said the president's Cabinet would have a breakfast
with Duberstein Thursday to discuss the transition and activities
for the remainder of the president's administration.
   He said Reagan would have a full Cabinet meeting later in the
day, at which the transition would be discussed. Also on the agenda
was discussion of the final budget Reagan will submit to Congress on
Jan. 9.
   Fitzwater said the Bush transition office would be located in
3{-floors of a Washington office building with enough room for a
staff of about 400. He said this would be the same size staff as for
the Reagan transition in 1980.
   Congress appropriated $3.5 million for the transition.
   Fitzwater said weekly planning meetings for the transition had
been under way since August.
   After the polls closed in California late Tuesday, Reagan called
both Bush and his running mate Dan Quayle, speaking to each for a
few minutes and ``offering his congratulations to both,'' said
Fitzwater.
   After telephoning the victors, Reagan released a statement
saying, ``Nancy and I congratulate Gerge Bush and Dan Quayle on
their historic victory. Their mandate will continue the changes that
create jobs, prosperity and peace for all Americans.''
   Reagan called the contest ``a long and vigorous campaign.
Governor Dukakis and Senator Bentsen represented their party with
strength and tenacity. Now we must pull together and help the vice
president lead America into the 1990s. I look forward to working
with George and his team on a smooth transition.''
   The president and first lady spent the evening watching the
returns on television and eating a buffet supper in the private
quarters of the White House.
   The couple invited Mrs. Reagan's brother, Richard Davis, his
family and several other friends and associates to join them,
including Reagan's daughter, Maureen.
   The president's pollster, Richard Wirthlin, kept the president
current on the election results throughout the day, Duberstein said.
   The president had not spoken with Bush for several days due to
their hectic campaign schedules, Duberstein said.
   Reagan's push on Bush's behalf took him to 30 appearances in 16
states after Labor Day. He wrapped up a 25,000-mile political
odyssey on Monday with a cross-country flight to California for
rallies in Long Beach and San Diego.

<TEXT>
   Q. Mr. Vice President, now that you've been elected, could you
share with us the lessons you learned in the Reagan administration,
and specifically how you'll run your administration differently?
   A. Well, I'll share with you the reason I think our president has
been effective. He takes a principled position and stays with it,
and he fights for what he believes in.
   And true, as somebody suggested, he had the benefit of a
Republican Senate when he started, but progress didn't stop when the
Republican Senate, when the control changed hands. So, I've learned
quite a bit about that.
   Certain principles, fundamental principles, and then fight for
them and stay with them, and that's what I will try to do. And every
president has his own management style, I've learned a lot about
delegation, on the other hand. I also, as I just responded here to
Jessie, I believe that you have to stay in close touch individually
with these people.
   Q. Getting back to Lisa's question, we've noticed as we followed
you in the campaign that you generally stay in rather affluent
suburban areas rather than poor inner cities, and not in black
neighborhoods at all since the convention. And I wonder, as a
symbol, is that a good symbol for a presidency that will try to
reach out and touch these people?
   A. I think the campaign was properly designed, strategically
operated. The message obviously got out to a lot of the American
people and I'm very pleased with the amount of the vote. But, in a
campaign, you obviously have to be sure you get your vote out.
   And that doesn't mean you don't want the votes of others because
you have to turn out your own people and reach out to as many people
as you can. I don't know if you were with us, Saul, at that
breakfast in Baltimore put on by Josh Smith, a black businessperson
there, on very short notice, a magnificent crowd of people there.
   But I had to campaign, set the agenda, set the schedule, and try
to win this election. And that is done now, and I had a very nice
talk, incidentally, last night, and I want to thank him for it here,
from, a phone call from Jesse Jackson, with whom I met as vice
president, in the vice president's residency, at least twice without
any fanfare, talking about common objectives. Yes?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you said in your opening statement that
you plan to bring a brand new team to Washington, but three of the
present Cabinet members, secretaries Brady, Cavazos, and Attorney
General Thornburgh, are regarded as Bush people. Do you plan to keep
any or all of them on in a new administration?
   A. There could be, but I will have announcements of that later
on. There will be, as I think I indicated, a major turnover, but
some people at various levels may be asked to remain. But, as I have
stated over the campaign, I think there is something to be said for
reinvigorating the process by, with new people. Yes?
   Q. During the last weeks of the campaign, you talked about
getting a mandate and about mainstream values in America. Do you
believe, with the closeness of the popular vote, that you have a
mandate, and could you be specific about what that means you will do?
   A. Well, I don't know whether I want to use the word ``mandate.''
I am very pleased with the results, and I don't think it was overly
close. I've got to be careful, because I haven't seen the numbers,
but I thought the latest I saw was around 54 percent, which I think
most people would consider a big win, and with many states.
   I think we exceeded _ well, I don't know, on the electoral vote,
the big, strong support from many, many states. So, I would simply
say the American people have spoken, the verdict was clear, and
therefore I will take what I think the prime issues of the campaign
were, and work constructively with Congress to attain the will of
the people. Yeah?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you said throughout the campaign, and as
recently as last night, that you want a ``kinder, gentler'' nation,
and that you hear voices of the ``quiet people.''
   Two questions, sir. Beyond the rhetoric and afterglow, what
specific programs are you proposing that will make this a ``kinder,
gentler'' nation? And, sir, what are those ``quiet people'', those
``quiet voices,'' telling you?
   A. Well, in the first place, they spoke loud and clear last
night, which I was pleased about. Secondly, I think, to go to the
first part of your question, I think when I talk about investing in
our kids, in the many proposals I've made in that area, that would
be an indication of how I will pursue this objective of a ``kinder
and gentler'' nation. I threw in, as you may remember, the whole
concept of trying to do the best I possibly can with the environment
in that. I used child care as a part of that. Yes?

<TEXT>
   The rightist Folkeflokken party
emerged victorious in elections in the Faroe Islands, a former
Danish colony in the North Atlantic.
   Party leader Sogvan Sundstein began trying to form a coalition
government after the results of Tuesday's elections were announced,
although officials predicted that would take a long time.
   The rightist party now has eight seats in the 32-member Lagting,
or parliament. The Social Democrats, which led the outgoing
three-party coalition, have seven.
   The election was fought over the failing, fisheries-based economy
in the chain of volcanic islands between Iceland and Scotland.
Falling catches and prices has led to mounting deficits in trade and
the archipelago's balance of payments.
   Voter turnout was 87.2 percent in the Faroes, which has a
population of 46,000. The islands have home rule status but foreign
affairs, defense and monetary policy are jointly administered from
Copenhagen.

<HEAD>Sakharov's Trip Largely Ignored by Soviet Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The visit by human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state
media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition
to the U.S. ``Star Wars'' program.
   That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its
international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only
mention made by Soviet media of Sakharov's visit to the United
States, which began Sunday.
   Radio Moscow said Sakharov made the comments about the Reagan
administration's space-based anti-missile program at a Boston news
conference.
   Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled to
spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoing
medical tests and promoting a new international organization he
belongs to.
   A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident
movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal
exile after criticizing the Kremlin's military drive into
Afghanistan.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in
December 1986. Some statements and articles by Sakharov have been
printed in the Soviet media since then, including an article last
week in a magazine that opposed some elements of Gorbachev's
blueprint for political and electoral reforms.
   Other activities by Sakharov have gone unreported here, including
his delivery to Gorbachev of a list of 200 Soviets reportedly held
in prison, labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their
political views.
   The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the
organization Sakharov belongs to _ the International Foundation for
the Survival and Development of Humanity _ held its first session in
Boston the previous day.
   Tass made no mention of Sakharov in its three-paragragh report,
but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by Yevgeny
Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

   Q. Mr. Vice President, you've made it clear that you appreciate
how hard all of us, all of us journalists work. Well, in the last
month of this campaign, you've made our jobs a lot harder by not
holding news conferences very frequently, certainly not frequently
enough for us to feel we can report on you as well as we might. As
president, will you be holding frequent or regular news conferences?
   A. Well, first, I think you've done a superb job reporting on me,
and I know some of you aren't going to believe this, but this is our
208th press conference since I announced for president of the United
States.
   And these aren't just shouted questions; these are where you sit
there like this and take them or go to a rope line and have a
microphone there. Now, recently we haven't had that many, but I feel
you have beautifully reported this campaign and that the message got
out. And I will strive to _ I won't strive to keep up 208 in a year
and a quarter, but I will do my best in terms of press conferences.
   Q. When will you hold regular formal news conferences?
   A. I'm not going to set a date. No, I'm not going to have one
every Tuesday, but I will hold regular press conferences and try to
endeavor, in the future as I have in the past, to answer these
questions. Owen? And then over here.
   Q. Sir, you campaigned against abortion, for voluntary school
prayer, for a line-item veto, for a balanced budget amendment. Would
you make these all top priorities of your administration by pushing
either a constitutional amendment or, if Congress rejects that,
would you lead an effort for a constitutional convention that would
adopt these provisions?
   A. I will be selling, setting out the priorities on these and
many other issues during the transition, and then I will make clear
the major priorities. But on these issues that I've spoken on, I do
feel very strongly about them. I have some real reservations about a
constitutional convention, however. Yes? Working our way down.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you _ in the course of the campaign,
you've spent quite a bit of time ridiculing liberals, who make up a
significant _ a significant number of people in the country consider
themselves liberals. Do you _ and you've created a fair amount of
bitterness as a result _ what specifically can you say to those
people that consider themselves liberals? Are they ...
   A. I said I want to be president of all the people. And I don't
think I've been _ was ridiculing. As a matter of fact, I was just
trying to get the facts out there. And I think the American people
understood that. But I would _ I can't do it their way.
   I don't plan to suddenly say, ``Well, okay, I accept what I call
the liberal agenda.'' That's what this election was about. Come join
us. If you've got some good ideas as to how to move this country
forward, I need them. Yes, Kathy, and then Mark.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, Senator Bentsen complained rather bitterly
about the tone of your campaign and spoke of distortions. You, in
turn, objected to the Democrats raising the issue of racism. What
kind of toll did this race take on your relationship with Bentsen,
and will you be able to work with him as chairman of ...
   A. His call last night, pledging to work together, which is
certainly my objective. And _ look, this campaign is over. There's
no hard feelings about that. The American people are smart. They
know a tough-fought campaign on both sides when they see it.
   So, I'm just going to keep, you know, saying what I've said here
and I've said yesterday, and I think Senator Bentsen's responding
yesterday as he did was extraordinary, and I think he means it.
Yeah. Mark, and then Dave _ and then Tom.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you told the American people to read your
lips _ no new taxes. But some people on Capitol Hill believe that
there will have to be revenue enhancements to reduce the deficit.
You've ruled out income tax increases, but will you rule out revenue
enhancements to reduce the budget deficits?
   A. Well, you'd have to define for me what you mean by ``revenue
enhancement.'' I got into a little flap in the campaign because I
did support the catastrophic health plan, and there was some charge
that that was a tax increase. I don't think it was.
   And I'm talking about holding the line on taxes, and I don't plan
to deviate, and I think the American people must have understood
that when they voted in rather large numbers for my candidacy. Yeah,
Dave?

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with California measures approved and
defeated, CORRECTS that Cape Cod board is countywide, sted
statewide; ADDS 3 grafs with Hawaii growth measures.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cape Cod residents voted to limit growth in their
communities and asked that future development be curbed before it
ruins the region's character.
   In California, where a score of cities were considering various
slow-growth proposals, four such measures on San Diego's ballot were
defeated and another was defeated in Riverside County. Similar
ballot issues were approved in two Orange County coastal cities.
   In Cape Cod, two non-binding ballot questions calling for a
moratorium on future development until a countywide regulating board
can be established were approved by a margin of about 2-1.
   ``I think it's a very strong message that comprehensive and
practical solutions to unfettered growth are being sought after by
the voters of Cape Cod,'' said Susan Nickerson of the Association
for the Preservation of Cape Cod.
   The population on the 65-mile finger of land has grown by 540
percent in the last 60 years, compared with a statewide increase of
only 50 percent during the same period, Nickerson said. About
175,000 people make the Cape their year-round home and in the summer
months, as many as 500,000 people are on the Cape.
   In California, two measures to ensure that the rapidly growing
University of California-Santa Cruz would pay for services needed
for expansion were approved by wide margins.
   In Huntington Beach, Measure J, limiting new development was
defeated 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent. Similar measures were
approved in Costa Mesa and San Juan Capistrano.
   But a Newport Beach measure was defeated 46.2 percent to 53.8
percent.
   And in Hawaii, residents of Oahu and Hawaii islands took
different courses on initiative proposals aimed at blocking
multimillion-dollar developments near two of the state's most
popular beaches.
   On Hawaii Island voters defeated by a 3-to-2 margin a proposal
that would have blocked a 350-room, $329 million resort hotel
adjacent to Hapuna Beach at South Kohala.
   On populous Oahu, however, the vote was nearly 2-to-1 in favor of
a measure blocking a 171-unit housing project across a highway from
Sandy Beach, a popular surfing site.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the maverick
Republican who gained national prominence in the Watergate era,
refused to concede defeat in his bid for a fourth term despite
unofficial totals showing him losing by a paper-thin margin to
Democrat Joseph I. Lieberman.
   A recount appeared likely.
   Connecticut voters also helped Republican George Bush win the
presidency over Democrat Michael Dukakis, handing him eight
electoral votes Tuesday.
   Final, unofficial returns showed Lieberman with 49.8 percent of
the vote to Weicker's 49.2 percent, or 678,191 votes to 669,983. Two
third-party candidates had a total of less than 1 percent of the
vote.
   Weicker's 8,208-vote loss exceeded the trigger that makes a
recount automatic under state law: a margin smaller than one-half of
1 percent and less than 2,000 votes. But the official vote total
wasn't expected to be available until tonight.
   Lieberman's upset came in a campaign that included television
commercials depicting Weicker as a bear who slept through some
Senate votes and missed others while traveling the country to
collect speaking fees.
   ``I wish I were here to declare a victory or defeat,'' Weicker
told supporters, his voice choking with emotion. ``Unfortunately,
I'm not in a position to do either right now. No matter how all this
turns out, I don't have one single gripe.''
   A jubilant Lieberman, the state's attorney general, claimed
victory. ``My friends, the American Dream is alive and well in
Connecticut tonight!'' Lieberman declared at a victory rally in
Hartford.
   Lieberman styled himself the ``people's lawyer'' on consumer and
environmental issues during six years as attorney general.
   In the presidential race, Bush had 735,791 votes to Dukakis'
667,808, or 52 percent to 47 percent. Libertarian Party candidate
Ron Paul had 11,522 votes, or 1 percent of the total.

   Q. Mr. Vice President, you've _ you may well have a chance to
appoint one or more Supreme Court justices in your administration.
You've promised to appoint men of conservative, moderate views.
Would someone who is pro-choice on abortion fit that category in any
way?
   A. I've said I don't have a litmus test for judges. What I have
is a test as to whether, in my view, they will legislate from the
bench, in which case I wouldn't want them, or whether they will
faithfully interpret the Constitution of the United States, in which
case I would. Yeah, Tom.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, a lot of economists keep saying that your
idea of a flexible freeze to reduce the budget deficit is just an
updated version of what somebody once called ``voodoo economics.''
Why are you so confident that the same basic policy that failed to
balance the budget under Ronald Reagan for eight years is going to
have more success under you?
   Q. Because other economists think it will. You can cite some that
think it won't, and I can cite some that think it will, and the
predication is there to have to keep the economy growing, and you
have to have inflation _ control that growth of spending to the rate
of inflation, but there's a lot of good people that think it's a
wonderful idea. So, I will just push for it in the Congress as best
I can. Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, we tend to judge our incoming presidents by
symbols as much as their policies. Have you given any thought to
whose picture you're going to put in the Oval Office, and whether
there is a phrase, a catch-phrase that you'll use for your
administration, like the New Deal, the Fair Deal, the Square Deal?
Will there there be something for the Bush administration we can
hang our hats on?
   A. I have not considered either one of those two things right
now, and there _ probably some thought will be given to the latter
in the transition period, but at this juncture I've not considered
that. Mike?
   Q. Mr. Bush, last night at your victory celebration, you talked
about healing the nation, but at a victory celebration it didn't
look like you were _ had the thrill of victory. I mean, you've been
positioning yourself for this office for more than 10 years. We've
seen you get pretty excited throwing a good horseshoe. You don't
seem to be that up. You said you had some trouble sleeping last
night. How does it feel? Has it hit you yet?
   A. It's beginning to. And you're right about last night because,
when I came over there, there was still some uncertainty _ not
really when we got to the Convention Center but when we were at the
family dinner and went back to the hotel, and there was still some
uncertainty.
   So I've been through a tug-and-pull before it became clear that
the numbers would work out as they have. And, of course, it was a
culmination of a long effort. And I do think that when you realize
that you're elected president of the United States, there must be a
shifting of gears, a recognition that the path ahead is going to be
a tremendous challenge, and you want to do your level best.
   I guess maybe I wasn't jumping with joy as much because my heart
was filled with a certain gratitude to the people that helped me get
here _ not only staff people, campaign people, but family,
particularly. And so, it was an evening of mixed emotion for me.
And, yet, I think you're right, Mike, when the balloons came, they
had a different feeling entirely than a campaign rally. The
exhilaration was underpinning it all.
   But I think the recognition that I've got a tremendous job ahead
and that I need God's help to get it done was also a part of that.
   Q. How does it feel now?
   A. Somewhere in between total exhilaration and recognition that
the challenge ahead is going to be awesome, that I need to get some
rest, and I think everybody involved in this campaign needs to get
some rest. And I will do that.
   But I can't use the word ``exciting.'' I can use the word
``gratified'' at the outcome _ better than many of us thought. But I
will not underestimate the challenge ahead. And there's a
seriousness that takes over right this minute. Yes?
   Q. Mr. Vice President, you said earlier that you were going to
provide the intelligence paper to Vice President Quayle. Do you
intend to set up with Mr. Quayle the same sort of relationship you
had with President Reagan in terms of coming in regularly for lunch
and ...
   A. Yes. I will do that, yes.
   Q. Mr. Vice President, in addition to God's help, you're going to
need Senator Dole's help. And throughout the campaign, he's
periodically given you ...
   A. What order do you place those in?

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush today named campaign
chairman James A. Baker III to be secretary of state and said the
new Republican administration would be ``holding the line on taxes.''
   Barely pausing to savor his smashing election victory, Bush used
a morning-after news conference to make the first handful of
appointments to guide his transition to the presidency. He promised
a ``brand new team'' when he takes over from President Reagan on
Jan. 20.
   Bush said his victory was still sinking in, and described his
personal feelings as ``somewhere between total exhilaration and
recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be awesome.''
   The president-elect said he has no ``litmus test'' for the
Supreme Court or other judicial appointments he will make over the
next four years, but said he didn't want to name anyone to the court
who would ``legislate from the bench.''
   Bush also pledged to work with the new Democratic Congress and
said he thought he could work ``harmoniously'' with Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole, a one-time rival who complained that the
newly elected president hadn't worked hard enough to elect
Republican congressional candidates.
   Bush was flying back to Washington after his news conference to
meet with President Reagan and discuss the transition. Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle was expected to meet the nation's newly
elected leader on his arrival.
   At his news conference in Texas, he renewed his campaign
statement that he was willing to meet Soviet Leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, but added, ``I don't think that would start before I
become president of the United States.'' He noted the superpowers
have differences on arms control, human rights and regional
conflicts.
   He expressed confidence that the Soviets would live up to their
commitment to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan.
   He also said support for the Nicaraguan Contras would have a
``high priority'' in his administration.
   In addition to Baker, Bush appointed chief of staff Craig Fuller
and pollster and senior campaign adviser Bob Teeter as co-directors
of the transition.
   His first Cabinet appointment came as no surprise.
   Bush said Baker, a longtime friend and fellow Texan, had set a
``new standard of excellence'' as White House chief of staff and
Treasury Secretary during the Reagan administration. Secretary of
State George Shultz ``enthusiastically endorses'' Baker as his
successor, Bush said.
   He praised Baker's ``proven skills as a negotiator,'' and said,
``the personal respect in which he is held will allow him again to
demonstrate the highest standards of performance as our next
secretary of state.''
   Bush told reporters as he was departing his 30-minute news
conference that he had spoken with British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher on Tuesday night. The two are expected to meet next week.
   Asked about his oft-repeated anti-tax campaign pledge, Bush
replied, ``I'm talking about holding the line on taxes and I don't
plan to deviate and I think the American people must have understood
that when they'' elected him.
   Queried about whether his insistence on no new taxes also covered
so-called ``revenue enhancements,'' Bush noted he had supported an
increase in Medicare premiums to finance catastrophic health
coverage. ``You'll have to define what you mean,'' he said.
   He also said Quayle would enjoy the same ``access to the papers,
access to the intelligence, access to the information'' that Bush
has had in the No. 2 slot. Bush did not cite specific duties for
Quayle, but said his vice president would meet regularly with him.
   Bush opened his first news conference as president-elect with
thanks for those who had supported him, and praise for the defeated
Democratic ticket, Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen. He also threw
a verbal bouquet in the direction of the reporters who covered his
campaign.
   Bush, who attended church services before mounting the news
conference podium, said he had ``just begun to think about the task
ahead and I am certain that God's help is absolutely essential for
anyone chosen to lead this great country of ours.''
   He moved with unusual speed in making his first Cabinet
appointment but hedged on others.
   Asked whether he would keep Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady or Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos _ all appointed in recent months _ he said, ``It could be.
I'll have announcements on that later on.''
   He also said campaign press secretary Sheila Tate would serve in
the same post for the transition, but said nothing of his plans for
a White House spokesman.
   He said his close aide Boyden Gray would be working closely with
Fuller and Teeter and would become his legal counsel in the White
House.
   At his news conference, Bush said his election was a clear
verdict and said he would ``work constructively with Congress to
obtain the will of the people.''
   As he left his hotel residence on his first morning as
president-elect, Bush said he felt ``just fine, thanks.''
   When a reporter suggested he might encounter a few problems with
the Democrat-controlled Senate next year, Bush replied, ``A few
problems everywhere.'' The Democrats held a 55-45 edge in the new
Senate, with one race too close to call. They had 54 seats in the
outgoing Senate.
   Bush's wife, Barbara, said she felt ``great'' after going to bed
at 1 a.m. and rising at 6 a.m.
   In his election-night speech, Bush said he wanted to bury the
hatchet after the rough campaign in which he had repeatedly bashed
the Democrat-controlled Congress.
   ``I'll do my level best to reach out and work constructively with
the United States Congress,'' he told a room jammed with jubilant
backers.
   One chief supporter, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, said Bush will
need the help of Congress to sell his programs to the public and
that ``he's going to reach out to Congress.'' Gramm predicted
Congress would respond positively but acknowledged there could be
tough times.
   ``Clearly when both husband and wife have to go to work the next
day the honeymoon can be short,'' Gramm said.
   Dukakis telephoned Bush shortly after the president's call, said
Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller.
   Bush also got congratulatory calls from running mate Quayle, an
Indiana senator, Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, Jesse Jackson and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Bush was the first vice president in 150 years to be elected
president.

<NOTE>Eds: Rewrites throughout to UPDATE with afternoon market
developments. A version moved on the financial wire</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The financial markets headed sharply lower today in a
surprisingly cool reaction to George Bush's victory over Michael
Dukakis in the presidential election.
   Economists said several factors depressed the dollar and stock
and bond prices, although uppermost in investors' minds was how the
president-elect would deal with crucial problems such as the budget
and trade deficits and with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   ``I think the markets already thought Bush would win and are
viewing the election as a non-event ... but some uncertainty
remains,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``What's depressing the bonds and stocks is that the dollar is
down pretty hard.''
   The dollar initially rallied overseas after Bush's victory
Tuesday. But it later eased in Japan and Europe, largely on
profit-taking, and it was down in early domestic trading despite
reports of central-bank intervention.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
16.18 to 2,111.31 as of 12:30 p.m EST. The closely watched indicator
had advanced 2.85 points in Election Day trading.
   Interest rates shot up today as bond prices declined. The yield
on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue rose to around 9 percent
for the first time in more than a month by midday, while its price
fell about $7.50 per $1,000 face amount. Short-term rates were up
slightly.
   Stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose
against major foreign currencies Tuesday, partly because of
confidence that Republican Bush would defeat Democrat Dukakis, and
that the victory would mean continuation of the Reagan
administration's economic policies.

<HEAD>New Indiana Governor Says Age Not a Factor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evan Bayh will be the nation's youngest
governor when he takes office in January, but the son of the former
senator says it's just a state of mind.
   ``Age is not relevant,'' said Bayh, the 32-year-old secretary of
state. ``It's ability. It's ideas. It's where you hope to lead
Indiana.''
   Bayh ended 20 years of Republican control of the governor's
office Tuesday when he defeated GOP Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz in the
race to succeed Gov. Robert D. Orr, who was barred from seeking a
third straight term.
   ``I want to hit the ground running,'' the handsome lawyer said of
his transition plans. ``We'll focus first on choosing a top-flight
executive staff, then on setting our legislative agenda and then
we'll scrutinize the budget to try to eliminate waste and
mismanagement.''
   Elected secretary of state in 1986, Bayh quickly kept his
campaign promises _ cutting his staff, rejecting a state-owned car
and running a trouble-free election recount _ and launched his run
for governor.
   Bayh, who will be 33 at his inauguration, is seven years younger
than Mississippi's Ray Mabus, currently the nation's youngest
governor.
   ``I'm feeling a whole lot older right now,'' Bayh said. ``It's
been a long campaign.''
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Bayh had 1,124,176
votes, or 53 percent, to Mutz' 994,842, or 47 percent.
   The gubernatorial victory was a measure of revenge for the Bayh
family. Birch E. Bayh lost his senate seat to Vice President-elect
Dan Quayle in 1980.
   ``To be sure, it's an asset to be well-known and to get people to
take a close look, but since then he's done it all on his own,'' the
elder Bayh said of his son.

   President Reagan on Wednesday vetoed a bill he
said would require unnecessary questions about plumbing, heating and
cooling facilities in housing units as part of the 1990 census.
   In a statement, Reagan said the questions ``would not produce
data sufficiently useful to justify their inclusion'' and would
``increase administrative costs and add to the paperwork burden
imposed on the public by the census.''
   ``Adequate data on plumbing and heating will continue to be
available through the census and other sources,'' the president said.
   The bill also would have required tabulations relating to
Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders as part of the census.
   Reagan said this ``would require the Census Bureau to use a form
of race question that the bureau has tested and found to be less
accurate than the one it plans to use in 1990.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Dissidents Clash With Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters threw firebombs and fought
police during scattered clashes Wednesday as hundreds of
demonstrators demanded that former President Chun Doo-hwan be
arrested on corruption charges.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters in Seoul and the
southern city of Kwangju, an opposition stronghold 188 miles south
of Seoul. A small number of arrests were reported.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!'' protesters shouted.
   In western Seoul, about 200 students hurled hundreds of firebombs
at riot police as the students tried to march out of Yonsei
University after holding a campus rally. About 10 students and
policemen were hurt.
   In the center of Seoul, two separate groups of up to 100
students, throwing rocks and firebombs, also clashed briefly with
with police. A few students were seen being taken away by police.
   About 700 students from five colleges, hurling rocks and
firebombs, fought riot police at Chosun University in Kwangju, the
capital of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's home province, South
Cholla. Police fired volleys of tear gas at the charging students.
   Radicals called for anti-government demonstrations Wednesday in
Seoul to press for Chun's arrest, but the few students and
dissidents who appeared were outnumbered by thousands of riot police
blanketing the area.
   Radical students staged violent demonstrations last week to
demand that Chun be punished for alleged corruption and human rights
violations under his government. Dissidents' groups have called for
another major protest Thursday.
   Chun, who left office in February after an authoritarian
seven-year rule, has come under public criticism for alleged misuse
of power and corruption involving him, his family and associates.
   Chun denied any wrongdoing, but two close family members have
been arrested for involvement in financial scandals. Prosecution
officials indicated Wednesday that two more of Chun's family members
may be arrested soon.
   Chun, who seized power with military backing in 1980, also is the
focus of a parliamentary inquiry into his alleged role in militarily
suppressing a 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju, in which about 200
people were killed.
   A parliamentary committee investigating the Kwangju incident has
voted to hear testimony from Chun and about a dozen other people
during a hearing beginning Nov. 18.
   Other witnesses called by the committee included former U.S.
Ambassador William Gleysteen Jr. and John Wickham, ex-commander of
the U.S. Forces in South Korea. The two Americans served here during
the Kwangju turmoil.
   The United States is accused of helping Chun suppress the Kwangju
uprising. The accusation stems from the fact that Wickham allowed a
South Korean unit under his operational control to be used to put
down the revolt.
   Under a joint command system, all South Korean troops are placed
under the operational control of the top U.S. commander here.
   Gleysteen and Wickham have denied Washington's involvement in the
Kwqangju case. They refused to testify in the South Korean National
Assembly, but said they would send letters clarifying their
positions.

<HEAD>Canadian Immigrant Gains Governorship After 16-Year State Senate
Career</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Stan Stephens says he saw a need
for change after 20 years of Democratic governors. But it took him
nearly two years on the stump to make others see things his way.
   The 59-year-old cable television executive, the first candidate
to announce in the contest to succeed retiring Gov. Ted Schwinden,
soundly defeated former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge to win the
gubernatorial race Tuesday.
   ``I'd like to feel we won the contest because people realize we
represent change,'' Stephens said. ``There was a desire on the part
of Montana to have change, to put someone with business experience
in the executive position of the state.''
   A Canadian immigrant who came to Montana to harvest wheat 39
years ago and decided to stay, Stephens labeled himself and running
mate Allen Kolstad as the candidates of change early in the campaign
and stressed their combined years of legislative and private
business experience in promising to revitalize Montana's ailing
economy.
   Stephens, a former radio broadcaster from Havre, logged 16 years
in the state Senate before retiring in 1986.
   He began his campaign in January 1987 to build statewide
recognition needed to challenge a Democrat as well-known as Judge.
   ``The two-year journey was necessary to market my candidacy and
to let the people know who Stan Stephens is and what he stands
for,'' he said.
   Stephens made leaner government a campaign theme, saying the
economic plans of his opponent would lead to increased state
bureaucracy. He pledged to reduce certain property taxes and
government regulation of business in an effort to invigorate the
private sector.

throughout the nation:
   
   Los Angeles Times:
   George Bush has bashed and slugged his way into the White House.
Now he faces the daunting task of pulling the nation together and
getting on with the business of governing America. ... Bush got to
the presidency by doggedness and not a little nastiness, abetted by
the ineptitude of Michael S. Dukakis' campaign.
   Bush is dragging a whole lot of baggage, perhaps more than any
other modern President-elect. ... He must move quickly and boldly to
assemble an Administration that exudes excellence, competence and
experience. Bush must overcome the doubts about his selection of Dan
Quayle with the appointment of a Cabinet and staff that contain the
best that the nation can produce.
   Bush must move on from the Reagan legacy. ... Unfortunately,
Bush's no-tax vow (not to raise taxes) makes it virtually impossible
for him to deal effectively with the voting public's single apparent
demand for action from the new Administration: to do something about
the budget deficit.

   The Cincinnati Enquirer:
   In winning Tuesday's election, Mr. Bush overcame many obstacles _
the historic jinx on sitting vice presidents who have aspired to the
presidency, the widespread perception of him as a perennial No. 2,
the vague feeling of many Americans that the time had come for a
change.
   That he overcame these and other obstacles suggests that the
weeks since the national convention have produced a new George Bush.
He went into the fall campaign a man of presidential stature in his
own right _ a man with his own vision of what America needs and
wants. That will be the George Bush who moves into the White House
on Jan. 20.

Democratic-controlled, which it all but certainly still is. He has

   Besides, presidential mandates are general and apply only to

   All this goes to show that mandates are worth only what their

   St. Louis Post-Dispatch:
   Apparently a majority of voters were untroubled by the deplorable
campaign conducted by the vice president; worse, perhaps they were
taken in by his insinuations that his opponent was an extremist, was
unpatriotic, belonged to a subversive organization and personally
let murderers out of prison.
   In either case, the first challenge facing the president-elect is
to demonstrate that, notwithstanding his sleazy campaign, his
presidency will not be predicated on appeals to people's worst
instincts. Down the road lies national division and turmoil.
   Mr. Bush, who was perceived through most of his career as a man
of moderate views and tolerant instincts, must move quickly to
reassure the millions of Americans who voted for Mr. Dukakis and
those who voted not at all that he will be president of all the
people, that he will seek to unite, not exclude.

   Almost a month ago, you said, ``I can't even start contemplating

   Chicago Tribune:
   George Bush must swiftly put the uglier moments of the
partisanship behind him. That should come naturally to him. Except
for his brief run in recent weeks as a tart-tongued political
infighter, he's been a liftime model of style and class. ...
   Well before the inauguration, a man with his hard-won sense of
the realities of the office will want to start tussling with the
intractable budget deficit and pushing for a sitdown with Mikhail
Gorbachev to get an update on glasnost and perestroika and the
climate for continued arms negotiation.
   A bipartisan commission is working on proposals to whittle the
deficit, but the new president is going to need help from Democrats
in Congress to work on acceptable compromises. ...
   At least one other high-priority item should be on
President-elect Bush's pre-inaugural agenda. He owes it to Dan
Quayle, his vice president-elect _ and to all of us _ to provide the
41-year-old senator with the best crash course that the brightest
transitional aides can teach to start preparing him for the awesome
possibility that he might have to lead this country.

   This election, (George Bush) told supporters in accepting the

coming years.
   For George Bush, the challenge is his own. Will he reach out

   Atlanta Journal:
   At first they called him a ``wimp''; in the end they were whining
about him being a bully who was too tough on his opponent. The truth
is that from the beginning of the 1988 campaign George Bush showed
admirable strength of character, coming back from defeat in the Iowa
caucus to win his party's nomination, and holding steady throughout
all the apparent ups and downs of the general election campaign. ...
   Since the Democratic Party had found itself unable to nominate a
truly moderate candidate, much less a conservative one, it was the
Democratic Party that defeated itself in 1988. Rather than facing
that reality, some Democrats will blame defeat on the ``unfair''
tactics of the opposition while others will find personal fault with
their candidate.
   The more liberal among them will find it particularly hard to put
the blame on their own wing of the party. But we say the election
was decided on issues _ basic, underlying issues. George Bush won
because he discerned the depths of these issues and stayed on
course; the Democrats did the rest to themselves.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer:
   George Bush attained the pinnacle of his political career with a
sweeping victory over Michael Dukakis last night, ending the
lengthiest and one of the most bitter presidential campaigns in
American history.
   All citizens now must hope that the new Republican
president-elect will succeed in fulfilling his campaign promises, to
seek a ``kinder, gentler nation'' and to build upon the best
elements of the Reagan years. That task will not be easy.
   The negativity of the campaign must be replaced by positive
commitments to raise the hopes and opportunities of those who have
very little of either. As Dukakis put it in his gracious concession
speech, every citizen must become ``a full shareholder of the
American dream.''

   The Indianapolis News:
   George Bush may not have won pretty, but he certainly won big.
   Yesterday, the long and brutal race that has been the 1988
national election came to an end. When the running was done, the man
Republican rivals called ``unelectable'' and Democratic critics
labeled a ``wimp'' had pounded Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
...
   Yesterday, George Bush won a sweeping victory in a hard-fought
campapign. Today, he faces an even tougher challenge than winning
the presidency: Governing the most powerful and complex nation in
the world.
   He and Dan Quayle deserve the support of Americans in both
political parties as they prepare to meet that challenge in the days
ahead. After all, the campaign is over. It's time to get back to
work.

   Nashville Banner:
   To win by such a margin is sweet vindication for Bush, derided
and mocked by the Democrats at their Atlanta convention and
portrayed on the cover of a national magazine as a candidate with
the image of a `wimp.'
   President-elect Bush will have a full agenda in coming weeks. He
will have to put together an administration and begin developing the
policies that will differentiate the Bush administration from the
Reagan administrations.
   As he does so and as the government prepares to shift gears, it
would be good to see from both sides a move toward the ``gentler
nation'' Bush called for in his nomination acceptance speech. ...
This has been a campaign characterized by attacks and accusations.
Now that it is over, some healing is in order.

   Minneapolis Star Tribune:
   The paradox inherent in Tuesday's presidential election suggests
difficulty ahead as George Bush seeks to govern this nation. No one
should find joy in that prospect. All Americans should wish Bush
well, for their future rides with his.
   The paradox is that Bush was chosen president in an election
Michael Dukakis lost and President Reagan won. Bush served as
intermediary, slashing at Dukakis while promoting Reagan policies
that brought deceptive prosperity and peace. Bush now has no Dukakis
to run against and no Reagan to run for. He must govern on his own.

   Japanese business and political leaders Wednesday
hailed George Bush's election as president, saying he is likely to
carry on in the spirit of building mutual trust and cooperation.
   ``The government of Japan expresses its heartfelt congratulations
to Vice President Bush on his election,'' said Keizo Obuchi, who as
chief cabinet secretary is the top government spokesman.
   ``The Reagan administration has constantly tried to strengthen
relations with Japan and the Asia-Pacific region, and has, in
particular, greatly contributed to strengthening U.S.-Japan
relations,'' Obuchi said.
   Japan ``is confident that, with the election of Mr. Bush, ...
Japan-U.S. relations will be further strengthened and developed in
the new era,'' the statement said.
   It called U.S.-Japan ties ``the axis of Japan's foreign relations
and security'' and said Tokyo ``intends to conduct bilateral
relations smoothly in the spirit of cooperation and joint endeavors,
and firmly maintain the relationship of friendship and cooperation
with the U.S.''
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita sent congratulatory messages to
Bush and his running mate, Dan Quayle, pledging to work closely with
the Bush administration toward global peace and close bilateral ties
promoted by the Reagan adminstration, the prime minister's office
reported.
   Japan's position would be little different if Democrat Michael
Dukakis had won the election, said Yukio Okamoto, director of the
Foreign Ministry's First North America Division.
   ``We had no doubt the spirit of our relations would have
continued in the same vein in a Democratic administration,'' Okamoto
told reporters.
   ``We don't distinguish between Ronald Reagan and George Bush,''
Okamoto said. ``They are working toward this noble cause (U.S.-Japan
ties) as a team. There is no reason to think (Bush) would be acting
differently from Mr. Reagan.''
   Japan's finance and trade ministers also welcomed Bush's victory,
praising him for his support of free trade and urging that the two
governments work closely to resolve trade friction and coordinate
economic policies.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the top opposition Japan
Socialist Party, congratulated Bush and urged him to drop U.S. calls
for Japan to strengthen its military capability and liberalize its
rice market.
   Top business executives also reacted favorably and urged Bush to
tackle the burgeoning U.S. budget deficit.
   Japan's financial markets reacted moderately to news of Bush's
win.
   The dollar opened at 125.52 yen Wednesday and moved higher in
midmorning Tokyo trading, receiving support from Bush's early
election lead. It later fell back on profit taking and closed at
124.65 yen, down .08 yen from Tuesday's close.

   George Bush finally won the biggest poker game
in American politics, not so much following the gambler's shrewd
instincts as trusting in the luck of the draw.
   In 1980, Bush heard Kenny Rogers' hit song, ``The Gambler,''
played incessantly on his campaign bus. ``You've got to know when to
hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,'' went the refrain.
   That May, Bush folded his cards and ended his two-year quest for
the presidency. But a couple of months later, he got lucky again. He
was tapped as Ronald Reagan's running mate, and spent the next eight
years as vice president.
   This year, Bush played his hand according to a carefully scripted
media campaign. He bested five Republican primary rivals and then
trounced Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis to claim the jackpot.
   ``You get a good bounce in life, and then one event feeds on
another,'' Bush once told a reporter.
   George Herbert Walker Bush, the resume candidate: Ivy League
education at Yale University, decorated Navy combat pilot in World
War II, successful Texas oilman, two-term House member from Houston,
unsuccessful Senate candidate, ambassador to the United Nations,
chairman of the Republican National Committee, director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, vice president, president-elect.
   Son of a wealthy two-term senator from Connecticut, grandson of
the man who donated the Walker Cup to golf, Bush has sought to
conceal his Eastern Establishment heritage with humor, occasional
annoyance and some good-ole-boy gestures that don't always ring true.
   ``There's a tendency to have you fit into a mold,'' Bush
complained this year. ``The mold for me is a kind of Ivy League
elitist, and I resist it.''
   He resisted by climbing behind the wheel of a tractor-trailer in
New Hampshire and announcing that he liked fried pork rinds. ``This
is the real me,'' he said. ``This is my home turf.''
   But try as he might, Bush had a hard time disguising his preppy
origins.
   Just before his highly publicized truck ride, Bush loped into a
cafe and asked the waitress to bring him ``a splash of tea.'' He
drew hoots when he was defeated in an Iowa GOP straw poll last year
because his supporters were ``off at the air show, they were off at
their daughter's coming-out party, or they were off teeing off on
the golf course.''
   Although Bush declared he was ``not going to mess up'' his
campaign against Dukakis, and largely succeeded, he stirred
controversy when he tapped Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running
mate. But Bush held his cards and rode out the storm over Quayle's
military service and academic performance.
   Bush was an intensely loyal vice president to Reagan. He made few
waves, and submerged any political or personal differences they
might have had.
   ``He's the dog that doesn't bark,'' said Richard Viguerie, the
direct-mail fund-raiser for conservative causes. Viguerie said in
1983 there was little evidence of Bush's impact on White House
policy decisions.
   Bush insisted he was ``out of the loop'' and played no part in
the Iran-Contra affair last year.
   Later, he said he had some misgivings about the arms-for-hostages
deal with Iran, in which weapons profits were diverted to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels. But Bush refused to say precisely what
advice, if any, he gave the president.
   The vice president did not escape criticism so easily when he
praised Ferdinand Marcos at a dinner in Manila, telling the
repressive Philippine president before his ouster that ``we love
your commitment to democracy.''
   Bush also created a furor when, during a visit to NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, he said Soviet tank mechanics
could teach Detroit auto workers a thing or two.
   Perhaps the most controversial entry on the lengthy Bush resume
is his one-year hitch as CIA director beginning in 1976, at a time
when Panama's military ruler, Gen. Manuel Noriega, was on the spy
agency's payroll as an informant.
   Bush has largely avoided questions about any relationship with
Noriega, who was subsequently indicted by two federal grand juries
in connection with his alleged involvement in drug trafficking.
   Bush dismisses suggestions that his CIA tenure would be a
liability as president.
   ``I led something at a very difficult time,'' he says. ``I went
in there when it had been demoralized by the attacks of a bunch of
little, untutored squirts from Capitol Hill ...
   ``And I stood up for the CIA then, and I stand up for it now. And
defend it. So let the liberals wring their hands and consider it a
liability. I consider it a strength.''
   Bush campaigned as a Goldwater Republican when he first ran for
Congress in 1966. When he sought the presidency in 1980, he shifted
to a more moderate position, referring to Reagan's supply-side
proposals as ``voodoo economics.'' He defends those same policies as
vice president.
   Bush has provoked enduring suspicion among some conservatives,
summed up in a 1980 article in the conservative weekly, Human Events.
   ``Bush was not anything close to being a Goldwater
conservative,'' the article said, noting that his ratings by the
conservative Americans for Constitutional Action dropped from a
``respectable'' 83 to 58 in three years as a congressman.
   ``Bush might as well have been in another party,'' the article
said.
   Bush can joke about his standing among conservatives.
   The day in May 1980 when he pulled out of the presidential race,
Bush was serving beer, cheese and crackers to campaign reporters in
the living room of his Houston home.
   Someone teased him about having a copy of William F. Buckley's
conservative magazine, National Review, on top of a pile on his
coffee table.
   ``Well, that doesn't have to be there any more,'' Bush said, and
slipped it to the bottom of the stack.

   Thirteen people escaped unharmed from a
Mississippi Farm Bureau office where an armed man took hostages and
held police at bay for more than eight hours until he surrendered
early Wednesday.
   Authorities said a former employee of the Marion County Farm
Bureau, M.L. Shaw, walked into the Board of Directors meeting
Tuesday night, brandishing a pistol and two rifles and demanding
seven years' back pay.
   ``Although I knew the man, when somebody has a gun and two cans
of gasoline, you don't know him,'' said Mayor Steve Pittman.
   Shaw, 63, released eight hostages about 2:30 a.m., Pittman said.
One man escaped out a back door soon after Shaw walked into the
meeting, and four others were released shortly on the head with a
slapstick.
   The deputies' lawsuit, which seeks $2 million in actual damages
and $1 million in punitive damages for each plaintiff, was filed
late last month in the state court in Sabine County.
   Dees and Cohen represented Garner's family and helped press for
prosecution in the case.
   The deputies' suit claims Dees and Cohen ``wrested control from
the lawfully elected district attorney of Sabine County and
appointed their own agent and servant, John Hannah, to not only
prosecute the Sabine County criminal action but to use his position
to publicly destroy the plaintiffs.''
   Hannah is a former U.S. attorney who was appointed special
prosecutor for the trial.
   The suit also alleges that Dees and Cohen are continuing to
pressure the Smith County district attorney to pursue murder charges
against the three men although a state appeals court ruled earlier
this fall that the trial would represent double jeopardy. Garner
died in a hospital in Smith County.
   The lawsuit also accuses the defendants of ``inexcusable
conduct'' that ended in a fund-raising letter the law center mailed
to many people in Texas.
   ``In only slightly veiled language, the mailing compared (Hyden
and Horton) to the Ku Klux Klan and implied that all southern white
people were racist and, based on this hate mail, they requested the
recipient to send in money to the Southern Poverty Law Center.''

<HEAD>Marine Sergeant Sentenced to Death for Wife's Murder
^Eds: CORRECTS name of facility at Fort Leavenworth in last graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL TORO MARINE AIR STATION, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Marine Corps sergeant
was sentenced to death for murdering his pregnant 24-year-old wife
despite his plea to a court martial to spare his life for the sake
of his children and family.
   ``I realize you have returned a guilty verdict ... for the most
serious of crimes,'' Sgt. Joseph L. Thomas, 28, said Tuesday in a
courtroom at the base, 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   But he added: ``I have worked hard all my life. I ask that you
spare my life for the sake of my children and my family. Thank you.''
   Thomas, a father of two, remarried after his wife's slaying, and
his current wife is nine months pregnant.
   Nevertheless, he was sentenced to death for beating Melinda Jean
Thomas to death on Dec. 9, 1987, and trying to cover up the murder
by staging a fiery car accident.
   ``The crime committed by the accused is so grievous, so
monstrous, so inhuman that the only adequate response is death,''
Capt. Paul McBride, the assistant prosecutor, said in arguing for
the death sentence.
   The prosecutor, Capt. Bradley N. Garber, portrayed Thomas as a
calculating killer who faked the car accident so he could collect
$50,000 from his wife's life insurance policy.
   Execution would be carried out by lethal injection, Marine Corps
spokesman Staff Sgt. Steve Short said.
   The sentence will be reviewed automatically by the commanding
general of El Toro's Third Marine Aircraft Wing and forwarded to the
Marines' court of military review and the Court of Military Appeals.
Thomas also can appeal his sentence to the U.S. Supreme Court, Short
said.
   Thomas joined the Marines in 1983 and was working as a telephone
and radio wiring specialist with a support group of the Third Marine
Aircraft Wing at the time of the murder.
   Thomas was convicted Nov. 3 of beating his wife Melinda Jean
Thomas to death. Her body was found in the burned wreckage of the
couple's Suzuki Samurai on Dec. 10, 1987, and the Riverside County
Coroner at first ruled the death a suicide.
   However, Thomas began to contradict himself months later in
routine follow-up interviews with military officials.
   Thomas' accomplice in the slaying, Lance Cpl. Michael Nelson,
testified during the monthlong court martial that he watched Thomas
beat his wife to death with a tire iron.
   Nelson, who testified in exchange for immunity from prosecution,
said that he helped Thomas load the woman's body into the trunk of a
rented car and drive it to a mountainous area.
   Once there, Nelson testified, he helped Thomas strap his wife's
body into the couple's vehicle, doused the vehicle with gasoline and
sent it hurtling off a 500-foot embankment.
   When the car failed to explode as expected, Nelson said he
climbed down the ravine and set it afire.
   Defense attorney Maj. Mark Stevens maintained that Nelson was the
real killer.
   Thomas has been held in a Camp Pendleton brig since his April 5
arrest. He will eventually be transferred to the U.S. Disciplinary
Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., pending completion of the
military review process.

   Soldiers with orders to shoot
anti-government demonstrators patrolled the capital Wednesday, the
third day of a nationwide strike that has brought commerce to a
standstill.
   The government said the strike was called by a Sinhalese radical
group, the People's Liberation Front, to disrupt Thursday's formal
nominations for the Dec. 19 presidential election.
   Hundreds of foreign tourists left for home after being evacuated
from beach resorts threatened by extremists.
   Radio reports said soldiers were ordered to shoot any
demonstrators, but no protests were reported Wednesday.
   The navy moved sailors into Colombo port, where 25,000 dock
workers have been off the job since Monday.
   ``Workers unite. Avoid a military takeover,'' said
Sinhalese-language leaflets distributed by the ultra-left New Lanka
Socialist Party, whose support is drawn largely from trade unions.
   Commerce in Colombo and most major towns was at a standstill as
banks and shops closed for fear of retaliation by Sinhalese radicals
demanding the resignation of President Junius R. Jayewardene and the
dissolution of Parliament.
   Jayewardene has said he will not run for re-election. His United
National Party's presidential flag bearer is the prime minister,
Ranasinghe Premadasa, and the chief opposition candidate is former
Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
   However, Jayewardene says he will ask for military help from
India if anyone tries to overthrow him. India already has 47,000
soldiers in Sri Lanka trying to end a Tamil separatist war, and last
week the arrival of Indian paratroopers in the Maldive islands
squelched an attempted coup in that tiny Indian Ocean nation by Sri
Lankan Tamil mercenaries.
   More than 9,000 foreign tourists were evacuated from resort towns
on the coast south of Colombo Tuesday after hotel staffers said they
received warnings the hotels would be attacked unless they closed.
The staffers said the threats were issued in the name of the
People's Liberation Front.
   The tourists _ mostly from West Germany, Italy, France and
Britain _ were transferred to Colombo and to Negombo further up the
coast. Many jammed the airport, trying to catch flights off the
island.
   Military officials said a crude bomb was thrown at a state-run
bus in a Colombo suburb Wednesday, injuring two people.
   The government has blamed the People's Liberation Front for the
deaths at of least 550 people in the last 15 months, but no
foreigners are known to have been among the victims.
   The front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the Jayewardene
government's peace efforts with guerrillas from the Tamil ethnic
minority.
   Jayewardene and most top government and military officials are
Sinhalese, the ethnic group comprising 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people.
   The president's offers of some autonomy for separatist Tamils
spurred a backlash in his own Sinhalese community after the
announcement of a July 29, 1987, peace accord designed to end a
Tamil campaign of terrorism.
   More than 8,500 people have died since militant Tamils began
attacking government troops and massacring Sinhalese civilians in
1983.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the population. The militant groups
seek a separate homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka to
counter what they say is discrimination by the Sinhalese.

   Frank Celeste, father of Gov. Richard
Celeste, died Wednesday from complications associated with liver and
colon cancer, the governor's office said. He was 81.
   The governor and other relatives were with him when he died.
   The elder Celeste had undergone surgery for colon cancer last
month at the Cleveland Clinic, said Debbie Phillips, a spokeswoman
for the governor. He died at the hospital.
   In 1955, the elder Celeste was elected mayor of Lakewood, a
Cleveland suburb. He served two terms and lost the Democratic
nomination for attorney general in 1962.
   His last bid for elected office was in 1967 when he ran for mayor
of Cleveland and lost in the Democratic primary to Carl B. Stokes.
Stokes became the first black mayor of a major U.S. city.
   The elder Celeste returned to his business, National Housing
Corp., which specialized in using federal aid to develop housing for
the elderly.
   Besides his sons, Richard and Theodore S., Celeste is survived by
his daughter, Patricia Hoffman, 11 grandchildren, and two
great-grandchildren.
   Plans for a memorial service are pending.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
Wednesday hailed the selection of James A. Baker III as a ``welcome
and heartening event.''
   Shultz, in a brief news conference, said President-elect George
Bush had telephoned him before announcing the selection. ``He will
hit the ground running,'' Shultz said of Baker, a Cabinet colleague
and partner at international economic summit meetings.
   ``His close, warm and productive relationship with
President-elect Bush makes him just the guy to serve as the
president's chief foreign policy adviser, and as chief spokesman for
the president and for our nation's interests in the new and bright
era we have entered,'' Shultz said.
   Shultz and Baker both are considered moderate to conservative in
their political views and are internationally minded. Together, they
tried without much success to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and
strengthen the dollar in world money markets.
   Relations with Moscow under energetic Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is likely to be the primary foreign policy issue facing
the new administration.
   ``Jim Baker is an old friend and a man I have long admired and
worked with closely and intensively,'' Shultz said.
``President-elect Bush's announcement that he will nominate Jim
Baker to be the 61st secretary of state is a welcome and heartening
event.''
   Shultz said, however, without being specific, that there may be
differences as well as continuity in U.S. foreign policy in the Bush
administration.
   ``Of course, the president is the man who sets the foreign
policy,'' Shultz said. ``I think it is important that the secretary
of state be close to the president, and we're fortunate to have this
team of President Bush and Secretary Baker as two people who have
had over a long period of time the closest kind of working
relationship.''
   Shultz added: ``I think that augurs well for our foreign policy.''
   With a little more than two months left on the job, Shultz
apparently plans no major foreign policy initiatives. But he has a
busy schedule, nonetheless.
   On Monday, he will fly to El Salvador for a meeting of the
Organization of American States, where he is expected to reiterate
his concerns about continued Sandinista rule in Nicaragua.
   Shultz also will meet during the week with Andrei D. Sakharov,
the Soviet physicist who has championed the cause of dissidents;
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   Next month Shultz plans to attend a meeting of the foreign
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. In
January, he will attend a meeting on chemical weapons in Paris.
   ``There are a lot of foreign policy issues that simply continue
to move along,'' said State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman.

<TEXT>
   Republican Conrad Burns only has two years
of political experience but the folksy former broadcaster is not
intimidated by the transition from county commissioner to the
powerful U.S. Senate.
   ``There's really no difference. We're just dealing in more zeros.
The responsibility's the same,'' said Burns after writing himself
into Montana history with an upset victory over two-term Democratic
Sen. John Melcher.
   On a day that saw Republicans capture the presidency, the
governorship and the state Senate, Burns became the first Republican
senator from Montana in 36 years and only the second man ever to
defeat an incumbent U.S. senator in Montana.
   ``It's nice to have a personal friend in the statehouse and it's
nice to have a personal friend in the White House,'' Burns said
Tuesday night.
   The 53-year-old Burns is a Yellowstone County commissioner from
Billings, Montana's largest city. He entered politics only two years
ago after a career as a broadcaster, livestock show manager and
field representative for a ranching publication.
   Burns barnstormed the state, meeting voters door-to-door and
telling them his outgoing, friendly style will be more effective in
the Senate than Melcher's ``obstructionist'' tactics.
   Burns campaigned as a conservative, saying Melcher was ``too
liberal'' for Montana and not an effective senator. He also labeled
Melcher a supporter of higher taxes and promised to vote against any
tax increasing, saying the federal deficit can be balanced by
restraining spending.
   ``I always like to win, but I enter all these things realizing
that voters may not approve,'' Melcher said early Wednesday. ``And
if they don't, you have to accept that.''
   The Republican National Senatorial Committee helped recruit Burns
as a candidate and assisted his campaign with money and advice.

   Arizona voters have rejected legislators' request
for a pay hike from $15,000 to $25,000 a year.
   The proposal, defeated by a 59-to-41 percent margin Tuesday, had
the support of the Arizona Bar Association and Chief Justice Frank
Gordon Jr., who presided as chief justice over the Senate
impeachment trial of former Gov. Evan Mecham earlier this year.
   Gordon, who himself received an $11,000 pay raise from the
Legislature, said he was impressed by the lawmakers he dealt with
during the trial.
   In Erie County, Pa., meanwhile, voters chastised Pennsylvania
legislators for accepting a $1,000-a-month ``expense account'' last
year. In advisory votes, residents urged Tuesday that lawmakers
return the money to the state treasury and be forced to hold public
hearings before implementing any future pay raises.
   With the increase, legislators' income increased from $35,000 to
$47,000 a year.

<HEAD>LaRouche Followers Lose in Pennsylvania, Ohio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Disciples of political extremist Lyndon LaRouche who had won
Democratic nominations for U.S. House seats in Pennsylvania and Ohio
were trounced by incumbent Republicans _ to the relief of Democratic
Party officials.
   In Pennsylvania, Donald Hadley, a Drexel Hill sales
representative, had shocked local Democratic party officials in the
5th Congressional District by upsetting the party-endorsed candidate
in the April 26 primary.
   After he lost, a stunned Robert Houchins declared, ``Charles
Manson could run for office and get elected. People better wake up.''
   Apparently they did. On Tuesday, Hadley was soundly defeated by
seven-term Republican Rep. Richard Schulze, who had taken no chances.
   In Ohio, Rep. John Kasich won his fourth congressional term by
easily defeating Democratic challenger Mark Brown. The Franklin
County Democratic Party refused to endorse Brown, 31, because of his
support for LaRouche.

Republican challenger who had called her a ``fairy queen.''
   John Sheppard, 51, is a Scio horse breeder and free-lance writer

   In a news release, Sheppard called Roberts a ``fairy queen'' in
apparent reference to her support for Gov. Neil Goldschmidt's

   Hales, 18, remained at school and left his race for the

Republican Rep. Bruce Holland, the incumbent.
   Even Hales' parents said they voted for Holland.
   ``We voted for Holland because we thought he was the most

   Farrah Fawcett is making a movie about
photojournalist Margaret Bourke-White, and the filming provided a
double thrill for a woman whose 8-month-old son was used as an extra
to sit on Fawcett's lap.
   Loretta Williams of Houma watched her son Derrick from a sideline
seat and chatted with an amiable man sitting next to her.
   ``He kept telling me to relax and then began talking about
Derrick and his children,'' she said Monday. ``It wasn't until I was
walking away that I found out who it was I had been sitting next
to.''
   It was actor Ryan O'Neal.
   ``I tell you what, he is one good-looking man,'' Williams said.
``I could have screamed though, to think I was sitting next to Ryan
O'Neal and talking about Derrick and just everything.''
   ``Margaret Bourke-White,'' the made-for-television movie, stars
Fawcett in the title role of the one-time Life magazine photographer
who covered everything from life in America and the Soviet Union to
World War II combat.
   Derrick's big scene, filmed Friday, may turn out to be a fleeting
appearance after final cuts.
   ``It took them seven hours to shoot that scene,'' Williams said.
``I tell you what, I've got a lot of respect for those people that
do this kind of work now. They really put in a lot of long hours.''

   Wearing his trademark bib overalls, a red-and-blue
baseball cap and hiking boots bought from a New York street vendor,
Paris fashion designer Patrick Kelly arrived to critique designs by
fashion students.
   The designer has come a long way from picking cotton with his
father and grandfather in Vicksburg, Miss., to designing clothes for
Princess Diana and the rock star Prince.
   In July, Kelly became the first American voted into the Chambre
Syndicale, a fashion organization whose members are top names in
French fashion.
   His year-old label, Patrick Kelly Paris, is projecting $7 million
in sales for this year, up from $5.2 million last year, according to
company President Mary Ann Wheaton.
   Kelly considers himself ``a black male Lucille Ball'' of fashion,
who likes to make people laugh with his designs featuring brilliant
colors, buttons and bows, and motifs such as embroidered lips, dice
and musical notes.
   ``I'm not really keen on supersophistication,'' Kelly said
Tuesday. ``I like people to smile.''
   When he found doors closed to him on New York's Seventh Avenue
fashion center, an anonymous donor _ Kelly believes it was a top
model _ gave him a one-way ticket to Paris in 1981.
   In Paris, Kelly sold his hand-sewn clothes on the streets before
free-lancing for other designers. By 1985, he began holding his own
shows.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev congratulated
President-elect George Bush on Wednesday and said he hopes the new
administration will continue developing U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``The Soviet Union is ready to continue and deepen mutually
beneficial Soviet-American cooperation'' on many issues, the Kremlin
leader said in a brief congratulatory message to Bush carried by
Tass, the Soviet news agency.
   ``I express the wish that your work on that high post will serve
to further development of stable and predictable relations between
the Soviet Union and the U.S. and to the improvement of the entire
international situation,'' Gorbachev said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said an early summit
is likely.
   ``Such summits have become normal phenomena in our relations,''
Perfiliev told a regular news briefing when asked about a meeting
between Bush and Gorbachev.
   ``I can be absolutely confident that such summits would follow,
but I can't provide concrete information as to the next summit,'' he
said.
   ``We note with satisfaction that the American electorate express
their view with regard to the continuation of arms control
negotiations and for expanding cooperation between the U.S.A. and
the Soviets in all possible areas,'' Perfiliev said.
   The Soviets had not expressed a strong preference in the
election, but Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said
last week the Soviets would like a prompt summit with the winner.
   Tass correspondents reported from Washington that Bush's election
victory over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis showed Americans
were satisfied with Reagan's economic policies and pleased with his
progress on arms control.
   They noted that Bush ``committed himself to the policy of the
current incumbent of the White House, Ronald Reagan.''
   ``The majority of American voters are satisfied with the
presidency of Reagan, who managed to cut unemployment in the country
to the lowest level of the past 14 years and to curb inflation by
bringing its level to 4 percent a year,'' Tass said.
   ``Under Reagan the first Soviet-U.S. treaty on the elimination of
two classes of nuclear weapons was concluded and way was open to
agreement on halving the strategic arsenals of the U.S.S.R. and
U.S.A.,'' Tass said.
   Tass referred to the treaty signed in Washington in December by
Reagan and Gorbachev under which the superpowers agreed to eliminate
their medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles.
   Negotiations toward a 50 percent cut in strategic weapons are
continuing, but slowed considerably as the Reagan administration
comes to a close.
   Tass said Bush also had campaigned on a platform calling for
negotiations with the Soviet Union from a position of strength
through strengthening NATO, and upgrading nuclear forces.
   Soviets who passed by the U.S. Embassy stopped and looked at a
pictoral display about Bush, including a biography with the headline
``New President.''
   The afternoon daily newspaper Izvestia front-paged a story about
Bush's victory headlined ``George Bush _ President of the U.S.A.,''
along with his biography and a portrait showing the president-elect
smiling and waving.
   Radio Moscow said that observers noted the election of Bush was
decided ``first and foremost by the improvement in the national
economy which took place lately under the present administration, a
reduction of inflation and the number of jobless.''
   Radio Moscow said the Republicans successfully portrayed Dukakis
as a liberal who was weak on foreign policy.

   Dan Quayle was born into a life of privilege
that took him from the golf course and fraternity row to the marble
halls of Congress with wondrous ease.
   At 41, the next vice president is an ardent conservative who is
praised by some for his quickness and derided by others as a
lightweight whose best assets are his blond good looks and capacity
to charm.
   His upbringing as the scion of a Midwestern publishing dynasty
was a comfortable existence, one in which Quayle acknowledged ``I
never had to worry about where I was going to go.''
   James Danforth Quayle was born in Indianapolis, oldest son of
James and Corinne Quayle. His maternal grandfather, Eugene C.
Pulliam, was a self-made millionaire with newspapers in Indiana and
elsewhere.
   As a teen-ager in the small town of Huntington, Ind., Quayle
attended Republican rallies and played golf, which his father called
``his first love and his passion.''
   ``In golf, what it gets down to is you're competing with
yourself,'' his mother said. ``He could be so hard on himself
sometimes.''
   Quayle chose not to apply that competitiveness in the academic
arena.
   At DePauw University, a small private school heavily endowed by
the family, Quayle was only a C student. Affable andsays the size of his
wealth also is exaggerated. While the
Pulliam family trust is reported to approach $1 billion, Quayle
receives no income from the trust's assets until after the deaths of
his step-grandmother and his mother. The assets cannot be dissolved
until 21 years after the death of his oldest son Tucker, now 14.
   Quayle's meteoric rise in politics came after a desultory brush
with the law practice he and Mrs. Quayle set up above his father's
newspaper, The Huntington Herald-Press, where Quayle was also
associate publisher.
   He defeated an eight-term congressman in 1976 and in 1980 ousted
Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh, with a little help from Ronald Reagan's
long coattails. Quayle easily won re-election in 1986.
   Orvas Beers, the GOP official who talked Quayle into running for
the House, calls him ``a real charmer.''
   ``I thought he'd get a lot of the women's vote because of his
friendliness, his personality and his good looks,'' Beers says.
   Charm aside, many Republicans were stunned when George Bush
plucked Quayle from relative obscurity over more senior lawmakers.
On the campaign trail, signs taunted: ``But can he type?'' and
``This Quayle Won't Fly.''
   In Congress, Quayle was never viewed as a heavy-hitter. But he
touts his legislative accomplishments, co-sponsoring a jobs training
act with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and his work on arms control
measures like the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
   He also supported Contra aid, voted to sustain President Reagan's
veto of a civil rights bill, supported the death penalty for drug
kingpins and voted for the Supreme Court nomination of Robert H.
Bork. He opposes abortion.
   Bush's choice was widely seen as a move to appease conservatives
and bring him a malleable vice president without his own political
agenda.
   During the campaign, Quayle demonstrated that he was eager to
please, from his exhortation to Bush at the GOP convention to ``go
get 'em'' to his travels to sometimes obscure rallies selected by
Bush strategists.
   Although occasionally frustrated by the controls imposed by the
Bush camp, Quayle followed his script and played the role of dutiful
No. 2.
   A scandal that brushed Quayle early in his political career
resurfaced during the campaign when a former Washington lobbyist,
Paula Parkinson, claimed he had propositioned her on a 1980 Florida
golf outing with several lawmakers.
   Quayle angrily denied the accusation and said he had gone there
only to play golf.
   Most people who know Quayle say he is a straight arrow who is
devoted to his wife and family. Marilyn Quayle had the last word
during the Parkinson episode with a line she has repeated over the
years: ``Anybody who knows Dan Quayle knows he would rather play
golf than have sex any day.''

<TEXT>
   Ronald Reagan, still the president of the
United States, promises a smooth transition from office as he moves
to a lame duck role in the shadow of his successor, George Bush.
   Reagan's term doesn't end until Jan. 20, but the public's focus
shifted to the next occupant of the White House on Wednesday at a
presidential-like news conference in Houston. There, Bush quickly
followed up his convincing Tuesday night election victory by
announcing his intended secretary of state and the leaders of his
transition team.
   Reagan's top aides, understandably, were reluctant to call down
the curtain on the Reagan era, and insisted their man was no lame
duck, that up until the moment Bush is sworn in, the world will know
the Great Communicator is still in charge.
   ``He's not going to drift off, or ride off into the sunset,''
Reagan's chief of staff, Kenneth Duberstein, insisted. ``He's going
to be active until the very end.''
   Reagan's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, added:
   ``This administration has a while to go before it becomes
history. In the next several months until January 20, there is quite
a bit on our plate. There is quite a bit the president has charged
us to do,'' he told members of the American Stock Exchange this week.
   To bolster that argument, Reagan's top aides have worked
feverishly to fill his dance card in the waning days of his
presidency with a round of speeches, visits by foreign dignitaries,
work on arms control and preparations for the next
commander-in-chief.
   And part and parcel to any Reagan agenda, a couple of nice
California vacations over Thanksgiving and New Year's have been
penciled in, with a groundbreaking ceremony planned in the Golden
State for the Reagan presidential library.
   Duberstein said he and his assistants had studied presidential
transitions over the past 20 years to prepare for the switch of
power.
   ``And whether it was Republican or Democrat,'' he said,
``something they all stressed was that only the president can make
the decisions between now and January 20th.''
   Given George Bush's longtime deference and loyalty to the man who
campaigned so hard on his behalf _ and Reagan's support for Bush _
White House aides predict the transition should go well.
   ``That's the easy part,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   The president and Bush ``are good personal friends. They
genuinely like each other. It should be a very smooth transition.''
   On Tuesday night, Bush was quick to thank Reagan for his help in
the campaign. And it was Bush who made the pilgrimage to the White
House to receive Reagan's congratulations Wednesday _ not a Reagan
visit to the GOP headquarters to offer a blessing, as some had
suggested might occur.
   ``I note the obvious. President Reagan is still the president of
the United States,'' Bush told the news conference Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said the two mens' schedules won't change much in terms
of dealing with each other, ``because they talk constantly on the
phone'' and will continue their weekly lunches over Mexican fare.
   In one area, Fitzwater said, Reagan has a particular interest:
the ongoing arms control negotiations for a U.S.-Soviet pact on
strategic weapons.
   ``There are still problems to address'' until the talks go into
recess, Fitzwater said. ``He wants to give his successor a fast
start and position the U.S. as effectively as possible'' for when
the talks begin anew in the new administration.
   On the domestic side, Reagan must consider the plethora of bills
pushed through the remaining days of the last Congress. And even if
Reagan has ruffled a few feathers with some vetoes _ such as a bill
on limiting advertising on children's television _ so be it,
Fitzwater said.
   ``That's good. It lets Congress know that he's still in charge,''
the spokesman said.
   Duberstein said that even though Congress has ignored Reagan's
past budgets, he intends to oversee the shipment of a final spending
outline to Capitol Hill on Jan. 9.
   The president does not intend to address Congress personally in
another State of the Union speech, the chief of staff said, but he
does plan to begin a series of speeches on such issues as
international trade. Reagan wants to share ``some of the lessons
he's learned,'' Duberstein said.
   Even though he has three months to go, Reagan might hold ``at
least one more'' news conference and can be expected to address the
nation on national television, he added.
   Reagan has scheduled meetings next week with Soviet dissident
Andrei Sakharov, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. Bush also was expected to meet with Kohl
and Mrs. Thatcher.
   Reagan recently has talked about ``hitting the mashed potato
circuit'' after leaving office in order to push for the repeal of
the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which bars a president from
serving more than two terms.
   Even though the president spends little time now dealing with
plans after leaving the White House, it's clearly on his mind,
Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said that on a recent plane ride, the subject of
his post-Oval Office time came up, ``and he got this big smile on
his face and his eyes just lit up.''
   He told Fitzwater: ``Oh, I think I'll find plenty to do.''

<TEXT>
   The English village of Messing, said by
genealogists to be George Bush's ancestral home, celebrated his
presidential triumph Wednesday with a toast at the local pub and a
cake inscribed ``Well done, George.''
   The 19 children at Messing's primary school drew pictures and
congratulatory cards while the grownups gathered in The Old Crown
pub to drink a toast and to cut a cake adorned with elephants.
   ``It has been so exciting. We have been keeping our fingers
crossed but we all knew he'd do it,'' said publican Diana Harris.
   Her husband, David, has written to the brewery chain that owns
the pub, asking permission to change its name to The George Bush.
   Messing, a village of 200 people, is 45 miles east of London, and
two genealogists say Bush's ancestor sailed from there to the New
World in about 1630.
   In June, when Bush's connection to Messing was first reported,
the children wrote to him, said their teacher, Gloria Waymont.
   She said Bush wrote back: ``Although I really don't know a lot
about my English forefathers from Messing, they obviously chose a
lovely area to call home. Perhaps I will be able to see it someday.''
   The teacher said she asked the children to spare a thought for
defeated Democratic rival Michael Dukakis, too. ``We said prayers
for him and I explained all about winning and losing a
competition,'' she said.
   Some villagers hoped the Bush connection would attract visitors
to Messing, in the same way President Reagan put Ballyporeen, his
ancestral Irish village, on the map when he visited there in 1984.
   ``I know there's a lot of interest and we are anticipating quite
a few visitors, particularly from America,'' said Messing's vicar,
Rev. Martin Clarke.
   Roger Carter, chairman of the Messing parish council, said he has
invited Bush to visit. He told the Today newspaper, ``If George Bush
does come to visit, it will be the first time anyone important has
come here in years.''
   Genealogists said Bush comes from a long line of well-off and
powerful relatives, and is related to European royalty.
   ``His family has for hundreds of years been at the top of the
totem pole socially and economically, although not at the
pinnacle,'' Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of the
blueblood directory Burke's Peerage, said in an interview. ``If you
like, they're the second string of the top.''
   He said his research shows that every presidential contender with
royal connections has reached the White House, and that Bush, a
distant cousin to Queen Elizabeth II, has more such connections than
any other.
   ``Even though this is a bit of scholarly nonsense which people in
the street are amused at, it's true and interesting,'' he said.
   Genealogist Hugh Peskett said the new president's family tree is
``not a wimp's pedigree by any means.''
   Peskett said he recently sent Bush research tracing the lineage
to Capt. Timothy Bush, an American revolutionary who fought first
the Indians and then the British under George Washington.
   ``He was larger-than-life, a total non-wimp,'' said Peskett.
   He added that ``fighting the British puts the family in the
United States aristocracy. In the U.S., having an ancestor in the
revolutionary party is about as high as you can get.''
   Brooks-Baker, an American who has also sent his work to the new
president, says Bush is directly descended from King Henry VII, from
one of Charles II's mistresses and from Henry VIII's younger sister,
Mary, who married King Louis XII of France.
   Charles' mistress, Barbara Villiers, who lived from 1641 to 1706,
was sixth cousin of Bush's great-great-great-great-great-great-great
grandmother, Elizabeth Wellington Fay, according to Brooks-Baker.
   He said Bush is related to all 60 royal families on the European
continent, and is the 13th cousin twice removed of the present
British queen.
   Brooks-Baker differs with Peskett, however, on which Bush
ancestor was first to emigrate to America. Burke's Peerage names him
as a Dr. Richard Palgrave who left England in 1630. Peskett opts for
Reynold Bush, son of a Messing farmer.

   They ran neck-and-neck for weeks in their race for

   With more than 3.9 million votes cast, barely 3,000 votes

breakdown of their 20,000 absentee ballots until Thursday. The
results are subject to recount.
   ``Here we're down to Wednesday, right? Almost noon and we have no
idea exactly when we're going to know,'' Mack said in Tampa.
   MacKay, 55, said he would be patient.
   ``Sure, I've got a lot of time invested in this already,'' he
said. ``We'll just have to wait it out.''
   Mack, 48, continued to guarantee victory, saying he believed the
absentee ballots were mostly in counties where he ran well.
   ``I feel quite confident we're going to be declaring victory,''
he said. ``The question is when.''
   The election was to succeed retiring three-term incumbent
Democrat U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   With all precincts in, Mack had 1,977,825 votes, or 50 percent,
to MacKay's 1,974,586 votes, also 50 percent.
   Mack, the conservative grandson of the Hall of Fame baseball
manager, hoped to follow George Bush's smashing triumph. Bush swept
61 percent of the vote to claim Florida's 21 electoral votes.
   The presidential race was never in doubt. Bush became the eighth
Republican in the last 10 elections to carry Florida. With 99
percent of the precincts reporting, Bush received 2,519,778 million
votes, or 61 percent, to Michael Dukakis' 1,624,361 votes, or 39
percent.
   Florida's 19-member congressional delegation shifted from 12
Democrats and seven Republicans to 10 Democrats and eight
Republicans, with one race, expected to go to the Democrats, still
out.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Bill Emerson saw Wayne Cryts
coming this time, and he was ready.
   Emerson, a Republican, used a well-funded campaign and a barrage
of television advertising to turn back the well-known farm activist
by a 58-to-42 percent margin and win a fifth term in Congress on
Tuesday.
   Emerson had defeated Cryts by just 7,500 votes out of about
150,000 cast two years ago.
   This campaign was a bitter one. Emerson complained that Cryts
dwelled on the fact that Emerson had sought treatment for alcoholism
in the past year, and Cryts said Emerson ran a negative campaign.

   The Republican congressman, dean of the six-member South Carolina

<HEAD>Oklahoma, New Mexico Voters Approve Change In Bail Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oklahoma voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional
amendment making it easier for judges to hold suspects without bail,
while New Mexico voters passed an amendment that would allow bail to
be denied for people with a prior conviction.
   The Oklahoma amendment was proposed after the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld a similar federal law. Under the amendment, a judge can
refuse bail in certain drug cases, in violent crimes and for certain
multiple offenses.
   New Mexico's Amendment No. 5, the so-called ``Dena Lynn Gore
amendment,'' will allow bail to be denied for people convicted of a
crime, even if the crime is not a capital offense.
   Dena Lynn Gore was abducted and killed in 1986 by a man free on
bail while appealing his conviction in the earlier rape of a
6-year-old girl.

   GOP Sen. Chic Hecht, unseated despite a
dramatic come-from-behind campaign, said Wednesday he had no regrets
and is ready to unite behind the man who beat him.
   Democratic Gov. Dick Bryan beat Hecht with 175,327 votes, or 51
percent, to Hecht's 161,180 votes, or 47 percent, according to final
unofficial returns.
   The rest of the votes were divided between Libertarian James Frye
and Nevada's unique ``None of these candidates'' ballot option.
   In other races, Republican Rep. Barbara Vucanovich and Democrat
Rep. Jim Bilbray retained their seats, and George Bush won 60
percent of the state's presidential tally and its four electoral
votes.
   Hecht, an upset winner over veteran Sen. Howard Cannon in 1982,
said he offered to help Bryan with the transition period.
   ``It's been a tough campaign. It's behind us,'' said Hecht, 59.
``Let's look to the future. Let's unite behind the new senator.''
   Hecht said he had no regrets about the bitterly contested battle
with Bryan and would ``never look back.'' He also said he had no
future plans except a return to Nevada when his term ends.
   The vote capped an often bitter battle between the two men in the
state's costliest race ever, with an estimated $6 million in total
spending.
   ``This was a tough campaign,'' said the 51-year-old Bryan. ``I've
been involved in a lot of races, faced a lot of formidable
challenges, but this was a very tough one.''
   Bryan, midway through his second term as governor, entered the
race in March. With his win, the governorship will pass to Lt. Gov.
Bob Miller, 43.

   President-elect George Bush is headed for
likely conflict with a strengthened Democratic majority in Congress,
but Republicans say he can still enjoy a honeymoon if he gives
assertive and moderate direction on the budget deficit, housing and
the environment.
   Democrats go into the 101st Congress with slightly greater
majorities in both Houses. In the Senate, the current 54-46
advantage appeared likely to be padded by one or two seats,
depending largely on the outcome of a cliffhanger race in Florida.
And House Democrats appeared headed for a net gain of five seats.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, said he was ``not overjoyed at the results''
and acknowledged: ``The question is, whether there will be a
honeymoon ... Certainly there will be considerable conflict between
their agenda and our agenda.''
   ``I'm not sure what the mandate is,'' he said, adding that by
retaining a Republican White House and a Democratic Congress, voters
are saying ``they're relatively satisfied with the conditions that
they find.''
   And he agreed with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., that
``this race was not about coattails.'' GOP candidates who linked
themselves strongly to Bush lost more than they won.
   But he said major problems need to be addressed in the areas of
the budget deficit, the environment and low-income housing. While
the new president may not get off at a gallop when he takes office
in January, if he ``takes charge of those outstanding issues
quickly, I think he'll start off as president with a canter.''
   Boschwitz said he believed Bush would begin with ``a very
aggressive team'' headed by top adviser James A. Baker III, the
secretary of state-designate. ``Hopefully that will be reflected in
the legislative agenda,'' he said, and there will be a good chance
for success.
   Bush agreed, saying at a news conference, ``The question is,
we've got to get some good support from the Democrats for some of
these ideas.''
   ``If there is one of the messages of the campaign, it is that
liberalism, at least as some people define it, is not as much in
vogue as it was,'' Boschwitz said, noting that Democrats in
Nebraska, Ohio, New Jersey ``ran away from Dukakis.''
   Tuesday's results marked the first time since the 1960 election
of Democrat John F. Kennedy that the party which lost the White
House gained seats in both houses of Congress.
   Democrats unseated GOP incumbents Lowell Weicker in Connecticut,
Chic Hecht in Nevada and David Karnes in Nebraska, and picked up a
previously Republican seat in Virginia. Republicans offset that by
knocking off incumbent John Melcher in Montana and converting
Mississippi's Democratic seat to their column. Florida's race
between Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay and GOP Rep. Connie Mack
remained too close to call and largely dependent on the outcome of
100,000 absentee ballots.
   Democrats agreed that the election's outcome was a mandate for
the status quo, but disagreed with Republicans about what that
meant. They contended the voters called for a continuation of the
past two years, when the Democratic Congress has dictated much of
public policy to a lame-duck GOP administration.
   ``Continuity, over the last two years, has meant Congress setting
the agenda on the budget, trade, clean water, plant closing, welfare
reform and catastrophic health care,'' said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman
for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Democrats will
seek to continue those kinds of priorities, she said.
   One early sign of potential friction came not from the Democrats,
but from Dole, who will be in charge of shepherding Bush's
legislative agenda through the new Congress. As returns rolled in
Tuesday night, Dole criticized Bush for turning aside requests to
help Mack in Florida. And he said when Hecht pleaded for help in
Nevada, Bush ``flew over it.''
   Boschwitz disagreed, saying ``Bush did most of the things we
wanted ... Not all the help, but it's not the nature of things that
you get everything that you want.''
   Dole also has made public comments doubting whether Bush can
honor his ``read my lips'' vow not to increase any taxes, and has
hinted that the Bush campaign's idea to control the deficit through
a ``flexible freeze'' lacks substance.
   Bush dismissed suggestions that trouble was brewing, saying he
would meet with Dole. ``He is an effective Republican leader and I
will work with him ... I think that we can work harmoniously
together,'' he said.
   An unanswered question stemming from Tuesday's voting was what
will happen in Indiana, where Republican Sen. Dan Quayle will leave
his congressional seat to take over the vice presidency. A successor
will have to be appointed by the governor, and it was assumed that
Quayle would resign from the Senate early to allow that choice to be
made by Republican Gov. Robert Orr, whose term expires in January.
   Boschwitz said he would be counseling Orr to select somebody who
can hold the seat when it comes before the voters in a special
election in 1990. Names that have been mentioned include GOP Rep.
Daniel Coats; Lt. Gov. John Mutz, who lost in his bid to become
governor on Tuesday; and Steve Goldsmith, the Indianapolis
prosecutor who ran as Mutz's lieutenant governor nominee. Also
mentioned has been Quayle's wife, Marilyn, but Boschwitz called that
suggestion ``not realistic.''

   The ties between James A. Baker III and George
Bush go back nearly two decades when Baker left his law practice in
Houston to help Bush, a tennis partner, campaign unsuccessfully for
the Senate.
   Their political careers have been intertwined every since and
over the years the two men developed a close friendship.
   Among the mementos cherished by Baker, who was announced
Wednesday as Bush's choice for secretary of state, is a Bush photo
signed by the president-elect with the note: ``What would we do
without real friends?''
   Baker's selection came as no surprise. It had been widely
reported that Baker wanted the job and just as clear that he could
have virtually any post that interested him in a new Bush
administration.
   Secretary of State George Shultz predicted that his successor
will ``hit the ground running'' and told reporters that Baker's
``close, warm and productive relationship'' with Bush ``makes him
just the guy'' to be the president's chief foreign policy adviser
and spokesman.
   Bush said in Houston that Baker has ``distinguished himself in
every position he has held in the Reagan administration.''
   The 58-year-old Baker served as White House chief of staff during
the first Reagan term and took over as treasury secretary in l985.
He resigned from the Cabinet last August to be Bush's presidential
campaign chairman.
   It was 18 years ago that Baker took on a similar job for Bush,
who was challenging Democrat Lloyd Bentsen for a Senate seat. Baker,
then a Democrat, was convinced by Bush to turn Republican, and their
long relationship began.
   Bush was soundly defeated by Bentsen in 1970. Ten years later,
Baker again headed a Bush campaign, this time an unsuccessful effort
against Ronald Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination.
Despite Bush's help, Baker fared no better in his only try at
elected office _ a l978 defeat in a race for Texas attorney general.
   Nevertheless, Baker over the years developed a reputation as one
of the Republican Party's craftiest political strategists.
   In l976, he was credited for turning Gerald Ford's presidential
campaign around after five straight primary defeats. Baker helped
garnering enough delegates to allow Ford to narrowly win the GOP
nomination over Ronald Reagan. As Ford's campaign manager, Baker saw
a 30-point lag in the polls cut to within one percentage point of
Democrat Jimmy Carter.
   When named as Bush's campaign manager last August, one of Baker's
greatest assets was said to be his close relationship with the
candidate. The same relationship is expected to make him one of the
most powerful and influential members of the Cabinet with easy
access to the Oval Office.
   In his autobiography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush provides a hint
of the depth of that relationship, one in which Baker is able to
talk to Bush with frankness.
   Describing the last days of his unsuccessful l980 campaign
against Reagan, Bush wrote that it was Baker who one day brought
home the reality of the situation, saying: ``The campaign is
finished, George. You're the only one who doesn't know it.''
   Bush later became Reagan's running mate and Baker signed on as a
special campaign assistant. When Reagan was elected, he quickly
named Baker as his chief of staff.
   Baker is most frequently described as a moderate Republican and _
like Bush himself _ a pragmatist. While often the target of
criticism from the GOP's ultra-conservatives, he demonstrated an
ability to get along with congressional Democrats. He has been
credited with guiding Reagan's l981 tax cut proposal as well as the
administration's l986 tax-overhaul bill through Congress.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, has described him as ``an honest adversary'' with
``a first class political gut.''
   In l985, Baker, then White House chief of staff, made clear he
wanted a new challenge, prompting a celebrated job swap with
then-Treasury Secretary Donald Regan.
   At Treasury, Baker amassed an unusual amount of influence. While
described as a man who occasionally made mistakes, he also was
characterized as a quick learner who rapidly ``grew into the job.''
   He won plaudits internationally for persuading U.S. allies to
coordinate their economic policies and for negotiating a U.S.
Canadian free-trade pact. He was the architect of a plan, which has
yet to bear fruit, to help ease the Third World debt crisis through
billions of dollars in loans from commercial banks.
   On another international matter, Baker is said to favor
development of a bipartisan consensus on Central America policy.
While supporting aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, he is said to
lack some of the pro-Contra passion evident among many of the other
officials of the outgoing administration.
   Baker and Bush, who is six years his senior, came from similar
backgrounds.
   Both grew up in wealthy families, went to prep schools in the
East and then to Ivy League colleges. They share a love for sports
and Mexican foods.
   Along with the autographed picture of Bush, another Baker memento
is a newspaper clipping from the l930s that quotes his millionaire
grandfather's formula for success.
   ``Work hard, study and keep out of politics,'' his grandfather
was fond of saying. Baker embraced two out of three, but the third
one eluded him. George Bush was the reason why.

   Democrats ousted West Virginia's Arch Moore, the only incumbent
unseated, and won in Indiana for the first time since 1964 behind
Evan Bayh, the nation's youngest governor at 32. The GOP ended 20
years of Democratic control in Montana.
   Embattled Republican incumbents were narrowly re-elected in Rhode
Island and Utah.
   GOP incumbents won more easily in Delaware, Missouri and North
Carolina, and a new Republican replaced an old one in New Hampshire.
Democratic incumbents were returned by wide margins in North Dakota,
Vermont and Washington.
   Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and three Democrats _ were on
the ballot. Three others _ in Indiana, Montana and New Hampshire _
are either retiring or barred by law from a third term.

   Rescuers are being forced to trek on foot through
heavily wooded mountain regions to reach some villages devastated by
an earthquake that killed more than 930 people in southern China,
Beijing Radio said Wednesday.
   ``The obstacles to rescue are much worse than experts at first
believed,'' it said. It said the village of Zhanmapo, believed the
worst hit with 297 dead, was accessible only by a footpath, and that
this had been blocked by a landslide.
   ``The victims can only be helped by air or on foot,'' the radio
said. ``Four planes are air-dropping food, clothing and other
necessities to the hardest hit areas.''
   The quake that struck southwestern Yunnan province Sunday night
was China's worst since a 1976 earthquake that killed 242,000
people. The Yunnan quake measured 7.6 on the Richter scale,
signifying a powerful quake capable of heavy damage, and by
Wednesday morning had been followed by 184 aftershocks.
   Beijing Radio said seismologists had met the day before the quake
and decided to issue a warning of a coming tremor, but they did not
expect it to hit so soon or so strongly. It was not immediately
clear if they had issued any warning.
   The Ministry of Civil Affairs told U.N. relief agencies that more
than 100,000 people were homeless, and the official China News
Service said 1,986 were injured, most of them seriously. The
ministry did not change its count from Tuesday of 938 dead.
   The quake affected 14 counties with a total population of more
than 1 million people, scattered over 16,000 square miles along the
border with Burma.
   Trevor Page, the U.N. World Food Program's Beijing
representative, quoted the Ministry of Civil Affairs as saying
relief workers still have not been able to reach many villages. Most
of the casualties counted so far have been in just one county,
Lancang.
   The ministry also said it would welcome donations of food,
medical supplies and plastic sheeting for temporary shelters, Page
said.
   He said the Chinese specified they were not appealing for help
but ``would welcome any appropriate assistance by friendly countries
or international organizations.''
   The ruling Communist Party and the State Council, China's
cabinet, issued a statement expressing sympathy for quake victims
and urging them to rebuild their homes and restore production soon
in a spirit of self-reliance.
   Lancang is home to the Lahu minority, one of several farming
ethnic minorities that live in the border region.
   China is one of the most earthquake prone countries in the world.
Its last major quake was in August 1985, when 71 people were killed
and 125 injured by a temblor in far western Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region. That quake registered 7.4 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake,
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 7.0 can cause heavy, widespread damage in a populated area.

   For an electorate said to be disappointed in
the candidates and disgusted with the process, American voters
delivered a ringing endorsement Tuesday for the status quo,
enforcing a fresh balance of power on the nation's two political
parties.
   Nov. 8, 1988. It wasn't so much election day as re-election day.
   Nearly everyone in sight _ White House Republicans and Capitol
Hill Democrats alike _ was routinely returned to office.
   By electing George Bush while strengtrats' hand
in Congress, voters hening the Democeffectively put an end to the Reagan
revolution.
A Bush era of pragmatic, bipartisan governance will likely begin.
   President-elect Bush clearly recognized the profound impact of
Tuesday's ticket-splitting: Asked whether he can work effectively
with his acerbic fellow Republican, Sen. Bob Dole, Bush on Wednesday
expressed only casual deference to his party's Senate leader and
then emphasized, ``We've got to get some good support from the
Democrats for some of these ideas.''
   ``Look, this campaign is over,'' Bush said when asked about
working with Lloyd Bentsen, the defeated Democratic running mate who
retains his chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee. ``There's
no hard feelings.''
   The Democrats had n advantages of incumbency, there is no
mistaking voter comfort with this power-sharing arrangement: White
House leadership from the Republicans balanced by purse-string
priorities set by congressional Democrats. For the first time in 28
years, the party losing the presidency actually increased its
standing in Congress.
   During President Reagan's first term _ with a landslide, a
supply-side mandate and a Republican Senate _ the White House called
the tune on Capitol Hill. But in the second term _ winner of 49
states but running behind no specific legislative program _ Reagan
was forced to compromise. The budget was written by congressional
collaboration and practically dumped on the White House door step.
   Bush said Wednesday he'd appoint a ``lean'' transition staff to
set priorities and to fashion a strategy for legislative success. He
indicated that he'll do a lot of jaw-boning to pass his programs,
and he's likely to take advantage of the fact that Congress would
welcome a flexible president with open arms.
   ``I think there'll be a honeymoon,'' said Senate Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden. ``Most of us have known George Bush for a
long time.'' Even so, he acknowledged that ``there will be a little
fence-mending needed'' after the nasty campaign.
   Bush reveled in the margin of his victory Wednesday, but he
seemed to realize that the voters provided no mandate for change, to
him or anyone else. Half those eligible to vote didn't bother, and
those who did vote spoke in one voice which appeared to say, ``Don't
make waves.''
   Status Quo I: The presidency was returned to the Republicans for
the fifth time in the last six elections.
   Status Quo II: The House of Representatives was re-elected en
masse; 99 percent of the members were returned to office, many
without opposition and all but a few without serious struggle. It
almost seemed that the only way for an incumbent to lose an election
was to be brought up on charges.
   Status Quo III: The House was securely in Democratic hands for
the 35th straight year.
   Status Quo IV: The Senate stood still as well. Democrats
increased their majority from eight to nine. A few incumbents were
forcibly removed from office, but voters delivered no significant
message to compete with the 1980 Reagan rebellion which sent 12
Democrats to the sidelines.
   (Aside from Michael Dukakis, the voters' most prominent victim
was Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a maverick lawmaker whose
disappearance from the Senate will do much to enhance party
discipline in the chamber.)
   Status Quo V: Voters were so intent on making no waves that
Marylanders withstood a $4 million barrage from the National Rifle
Association and declined to repeal an incumbent gun control law.
   Several House incumbents did not fare so well. Fernand St
Germain, a power in the House for many years and chairman of the
House Banking Committee, barely survived a Justice Department
investigation which cited ``evidence of serious and sustained
misconduct'' for allegedly accepting favors from lobbyists. He
succumbed at the polls, as did freshman Pat Swindall.
   Swindall, R-Ga., was turned out of office following his
indictment on perjury charges in a drug laundering case.
   A few incumbents were actually turned out without a hint of
scandal. Sens. John Melcher, Chic Hecht, David Karnes and Weicker,
along with Rep. Mac Sweeney, R-Texas, were left to wonder why the
voters singled them out as rare exceptions to the 1988 status quo.

   Emperor Hirohito's vital signs improved Wednesday,

   The world's longest reigning monarch told Imperial Household
Grand Steward Shoichi Fujimori that he was feeling better, but
Fujimori later described Hirohito as tired, the officials said.
   On Tuesday, the 87-year-old emperor's blood pressure plummeted
and remained dangerously low for more than seven hours despite an
emergency blood transfusion. At the same time his temperature and
pulse rate soared.
   Palace officials welcomed Wednesday's improvement, but said they
viewed it as only temporary.
   Palace spokesman Kenji Maeda said Hirohito did not discharge any
more blood from his bowels Wednesday and was not given any
transfusions. But he said doctors believed the emperor is continuing
to bleed in the area of his upper intestine.
   Hirohito has received 41.56 pints of blood, more than four times
the normal amount in his body, since his condition deteriorated on
Sept. 19.
   His blood pressure, which sank to 68 over 30 on Tuesday, was 108
over 50 Wednesday afternoon, Maeda said. A normal reading is about
120 over 80.
   Maeda said doctors remained concerned about possible damage from
low blood pressure, which reduces the flow of blood to the brain and
other key organs.
   ``We would like to endeavor to maintain the emperor's current
condition,'' Maeda quoted chief palace doctor Akira Takagi as saying.
   But doctors say they fear the emperor's internal bleeding may
have spread to a larger area of his upper intestine, where
physicians performed a bypass operation in September 1987.
   Palace sources say it will be difficult to continue giving
massive blood transfusions because doctors are having difficulty
finding suitable veins to do so.
   Palace officials have refused to confirm reports that Hirohito
has cancer.

<HEAD>Oregon Rejects Anti-Smoking Law, California Approves Cigarette Tax
Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of a 25-cent increase in California's cigarette tax
fought off a multimillion-dollar campaign by the tobacco industry,
which helped snuff out an Oregon measure that would have imposed the
nation's toughest anti-smoking law.
   California's Proposition 99, approved by nearly 58 percent
Tuesday, will raise about $600 million a year for anti-smoking
programs in the schools, wildlife protection, cancer research and
health care for the uninsured.
   The tax on a pack of cigarettes will go from 10 cents to 35 cents
on Jan. 1. It is the state's first tobacco tax hike in 22 years.
   ``People want smokers to pay their own way and keep kids from
getting hooked. That's what 99 does in a big way,'' said Jack
Nicholl, director of California's pro Proposition 99 campaign.
   Jeff Raimundo, spokesman for the tobacco industry-backed
Californians Against Unfair Tax Increases, said he believes voters
approved the tax hike because of the Legislature's failure to deal
with the health care crisis.
   ``I think because this year's ballot is one of the longest and
most complicated in the state's history, a lot of voters couldn't
get past the clutter out there and mistook Proposition 99 for a
health initiative,'' he said.
   In Oregon, voters rejected the anti-smoking measure by a 61-39
percent margin. The ordinance would have banned smoking in most
public places and imposed fines up to $250 for violators.
   Proponents blamed their loss on heavy advertising financed by
more than $2 million in contributions, largely from tobacco
companies.
   ``Frankly, a contract was let on Oregon and a hit was made,''
said Bob Neely, chairman of Cleaner Indoor Air for Oregonians. ``The
tobacco industry bought an election.''
   Mark Nelson, who headed the opposition, called that ``hogwash.''
   ``We had a difficult job of educating the public on what this
measure did,'' Nelson said. ``That took money.''

<HEAD>Moslem Defense Minister Replaces Christian Army Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moslem half of Lebanon's dual
government named a new army commander Wednesday even though the
Christian prime minister holds the post.
   The appointment of Maj. Gen Sami Khatib as acting commander of
the army _ made by by Adel Osseiran, defense minister in the Moslem
Cabinet _ could divide Lebanon's army along religious lines.
   Osserin, a Shiite Moslem, stopped short of firing Gen. Michel
Aoun as army commander, but the appointment of Khatib widened the
split between Christian and Moslem units of the nation's fractured
42,000-man army.
   The Lebanese Front, an alliance of right-wing Christians that
recognizes Aoun as prime minister and army commander, rejected
Osseiran's decision, calling it ``illegitimate because it comes from
an illegitimate authority.''
   Grand Mufti Sheik Hassan Khaled, spiritual leader of Lebanon's
Sunni Moslems, said: ``We now have a state of complete partition.
Alas, we cannot even try to stop it.''
   Lebanon has had no president since Sept. 23 when Amin Gemayel's
six-year term expired and parliament failed to elect a successor.
That caused the country's gravest constitutional crisis since
independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, was named prime minister of a
caretaker military Cabinet by Gemayel minutes before he stepped
down. Gemayel decreed that Aoun would also remain army commander.
   But Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions rejected Aoun's
Cabinet, charging it violated an unwritten 1943 national covenant
under which the premiership is held by the Sunnis, the presidency by
the Maronites and the parliament speakership by the Shiites.
   The Syrian-backed Moslem and leftist factions pledged allegiance
to the government of acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, which was
installed during Gemayel's term. Osseiran is a member of Hoss'
Cabinet.
   In announcing Khatib's appointment, Osseiran told reporters in
Moslem west Beirut that the post of army commander ``is considered
vacant because the original commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, has taken
up other duties.''
   Asked if the army now has two rival commanders, Osseiran said:
``Khatib has been appointed in an acting capacity. Gen. Aoun is the
original commander. He has the right to return to his post once his
other duties are over.''
   The constitutional crisis deepened Oct. 18 when parliament failed
to elect a new speaker to succeed Hussein Husseini, a pro-Syrian
Shiite.
   Aoun, who considers Hoss' Cabinet and its decisions illegitimate,
made no immediate comment on Osseiran's decision.
   Khatib, 55, a retired Sunni officer, accepted the post, saying:
``I shall excercise this job in a way that will serve the unity of
the army and the country.''
   In reality, however, Khatib will have authority over five
predominantly Moslem army brigades based in Moslem-controlled areas,
with only nominal control of some units affiliated to Moslem
militias.
   Five other brigades in the Christian heartland north and
northeast of Beirut remain under Aoun's control. They are better
trained and have most of the army's 200 U.S.-made, M-48 tanks and
heavy artillery.
   Khatib served as figurehead commander of the all-Syrian Arab
Deterrant Force, which intervened in Lebanon in 1976 with an Arab
Lague mandate to quell the civil war.

<HEAD>President Vetoes Food Study Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday vetoed
legislation calling for a study of the nutritional quality of the
food Americans eat, saying it would create an ``unnecessary and
complex federal bureaucracy.''
   He said the bill would have established a ``comprehensive plan
for the assessment of the nutritional and dietary status of the
United States population and the nutritional quality of food
consumed in the United States.''
   ``The administration strongly supports the principal goals of
this legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existing
authority to achieve these ends,'' Reagan said in a statement.
``However, enactment of the bill would set up federal nutrition
efforts on the wrong course.''
   ``The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the
bill's goals,'' he said.
   The bill gave shared responsibility for the program to
departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services and would
also have created an administrator of nutrition monitoring, an
interagency board and an advisory council.
   ``The creation of so much new federal bureaucracy would hinder,
rather than aid, performance of federal nutrition-related
functions,'' Reagan said.
   The bill would also ``impose a substantial new burden on the
American taxpayer in future years to pay for federal government
grants'' by requiring that a grant program be established as a
result of the study, he said.
   ``Experience shows that once the federal government begins
handing out money under a new grant program, a political
constituency develops that demands greater funding for that
program,'' the president said. ``Greater security should be given to
the need for the proposed new grant programs before they are locked
in as a future expansion of the federal budget.''

<HEAD>Dole Suggests Eliminating Buyout Deduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole said
Wednesday he wants to help President-elect George Bush avoid new
taxes, and suggested changes in the deductibility of interest
payments for loans used in corporate buyouts as a possible revenue
source.
   The Kansas senator, speaking to an American Stock Exchange
conference for international investors, said he doesn't think either
Democrats or Republicans in Congress are going to be looking for tax
increases.
   But he said corporate buyouts do not contribute to the economy,
and referred to tax deductions on buyout loans as loopholes in the
tax code.
   Dole denied what he said are media assertions that he would make
it difficult for Bush to keep his no-tax pledge. The pledge is
``fine with me,'' Dole said. ``My suggestion is that he'll have to
work that out with the Democrats.''
   He said Bush's plan for a ``flexible freeze'' on expenditures
``makes some sense.''
   Dole also praised Bush's designation of his campaign chairman,
former Treasury Secretary James Baker, as secretary of state, saying
the appointment would be ``well received by the Congress and well
received by the people of the United States.''
   Referring to concern over Bush's selection of Dan Quayle, who is
to be the next vice president, Dole said, ``I think today he
indicated he's going to continue picking top people.'' Dole said of
Baker, ``His reputation is solid.''
   Dole said he probably would have agreed to be Bush's running mate
had he been asked.
   Responding to concerns abroad that Quayle could become president,
Dole said, ``If some tragedy should happen, I believe Dan Quayle
could do it.'' He said Quayle would need a lot of help, but so would
anyone in that circumstance.

<HEAD>Democrats Heap Blame on Dukakis for Losing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats, once again on the wrong end of a
presidential election landslide, took scant comfort Wednesday from
election victories everywhere but at the top of the ticket and were
blaming Michael Dukakis for losing a race they once thought was
theirs to win.
   ``The Dukakis campaign ran the worst campaign of this century,''
said Robert Slagle, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.
   ``Clearly, the Democratic Party is alive and well,'' said Kathy
Vick of Louisiana, a former chairman of the Association of State
Democratic Party Chairs. ``We're in this position where we can elect
everybody but a president.''
   When asked if she thought Dukakis would get a lot of criticism
from party officials, she replied, ``Yep.''
   ``We left Atlanta (site of the Democratic National Convention)
thinking we could win,'' she said. ``Nobody thought it was going to
be a lead-pipe cinch. ... It ended up not being close.''
   While many Democrats were looking back on the 1988 campaign and
expressing frustration and anger, others were already looking ahead
to 1992.
   The morning television talk shows were a parade of potential
Democratic presidential candidates.
   ``Our next political season really does begin today,'' said Jesse
Jackson on the CBS show ``This Morning.''
   ``There are big-city elections in 1989, the census in 1990,
reapportionment in 1991,'' said Jackson, reeling off a list of what
he considered important challenges facing the Democrats even before
attention is turned to the next presidential contest.
   Jackson, who finished second to Dukakis in the race for the
presidential nomination and is considered a good bet to make another
run in 1992, declined to discuss that prospect.
   ``It's much too early to talk about 1992 politics,'' he said.
   Appearing on the same program, Gov. Bill Clinton, another
potential 1992 contender, said, ``There's still a very vigorous
national Democratic Party out there.''
   But the Arkansas governor warned against the ``L word'' that
plagued Dukakis in his campaign against Republican George Bush.
   He said Democrats ``have to articulate a philosphy that is not
perceived as too liberal. The American people are deeply
conservative in general and very progressive in particular. ... What
we have to do is make sure the American people know where the
Democratic Party stands.''
   On the NBC ``Today'' show, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn said the party
ought to ``shorten the overall primary season. I think we've got to
figure out a way to spend less money in the races and I think we've
got to change the procedures substantially so that the primaries
have a profile of voters much more like the general election.''
   In an interview on ABC election night, Nunn said that Bush ``was
able to define Mike Dukakis as a liberal ... he was able to define
what a liberal was until the last couple of weeks when Dukakis
really started defining his own philosophy.''
   ``It's almost become a belief among people that we're weak on
defense,'' said James Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.
``We have to change that.''
   ``This race was winnable,'' he went on. ``And we didn't win it.
But that's more a fault of the campaign that we ran. ... Mike
Dukakis will get a lot of blame, deserved or not deserved, but he
will get it.''
   ``Gun control just really killed us in rural Texas,'' said
Slagle. ``It hurt us badly. And he never adequately answered that
and there was nothing wrong with his position. ... But they didn't
sell it. At our insistence they finally ran one ad on that for all
of a week and then they pulled it down and never would run it
again.''
   ``They just ran a lousy campaign,'' he said. ``There were 101
banks failed in Texas. Did you ever see a single ad in Texas talking
about the instability of the financial situation from the Dukakis
campaign? No. There wasn't one.''

   Shiite Moslem hijackers who seized
a TWA jetliner also stole thousands of dollars in cash, jewelry and
other valuables from passengers, witnesses testified Wednesday at
Mohammed Ali Hamadi's trial.
   ``The hijackers robbed the passengers. Hamadi conducted the
search,'' Jimmy Dell Palmer told the court. ``I was in fear of my
life from the beginning. I was very scared. Hamadi seemed to be the
leader. He seemed to be giving orders.''
   Palmer and his wife, Sammie, were among 39 Americans held hostage
17 days during the June 1985 ordeal. U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was killed.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder, air
piracy and robbery in the seizure of TWA Flight 847. Hamadi
confessed to taking part in the hijacking but denied killing Stethem.
   ``The two hijackers were going up and down the plane relieving
passengers of jewelry. They took a diamond ring from me and more
than $9,000 in cash money,'' said Palmer, 51.
   His wife, also 51, testified the hijackers ``took away all our
valuables.''
   Palmer, an air conditioning technician, said he was returning
from a job in Saudi Arabia and had been paid in cash. The couple and
their 13-year-old son were traveling together when the TWA plane was
hijacked.
   ``It was a systematic search,'' Mrs. Palmer, a nurse, said.
``They took a gold chain, a bracelet and some more jewlry from my
purse.''
   Palmer said Hamadi's accomplice hit him once on the head and he
lost consciousness briefly. The accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, is a
fugitive.
   ``It was a very hard blow,'' said Mrs. Palmer, who testified
after her husband. ``I heard the crack of the gun against the skull
of my husband. It sounded as if it had cracked his skull.'' She said
he was knocked out for about five minutes.
   Other former hostages have also testified about the brutal
beatings of passengers by the hijackers.
   Mrs. Palmer said she heard two gunshots about the time Stethem
was killed.
   ``One shot sounded like it was inside the plane, the other,
shortly afterward, sounded like it came from outside the plane,''
she said.
   Like other witnesses, Mrs. Palmer said she did not see the
shooting. Pilot John Testrake has said he thought Hamadi killed
Stethem, whose body was thrown onto the tarmac of Beirut airport.
   The Palmers did not provide their hometown under guidelines set
by the court to protect witnesses. They lived in Little Rock, Ark.,
at the time of the hijacking.
   Stethem's partents, Richard and Patricia Stethem, have attended
the trial regularly since it opened July 5 in a heavily guared
courtroom inside Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison.
   Also watching Wednesday's session were Hamadi's parents, Fatima
and Ali Hassan Hamadi, who testified Tuesday. Hamadi, who broke down
in tears when his mother testified, frequently looked at them.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport Jan. 13, 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Town Under Curfew After Rioting Kills 10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers patrolled the northwestern town of
Sokoto on Wednesday and the town was under a dawn-to-dusk curfew
after riots sparked by the selection of a new Moslem sultan
reportedly killed 10 people.
   Authorities described the town, site of the sultan's palace, as
calm but tense, and government offices and businesses were closed.
   The new sultan, Ibrahim Dasuki, called a news conference and
urged people to remain calm.
   Dasuki, a 65-year-old millionaire and former civil servant, was
named Sunday to succeed Sadiq Abubakar as sultan in Kano province.
Abubakar, who was sultan for 50 years, died last week at age 85.
   Traditionally, the Kano sultan is the spiritual leader of
Nigeria's 50 million Moslems and is revered by Moslems in
neighboring countries. He is also frequently consulted by Nigerian
politicians, including non-Moslems.
   ``I know it was not possible to get the total support of all the
people because other aspirants had their different sympathizers,''
Dasuki said.
   He said he was confident Moslems supported his appointment
because of his experience as secretary of the Supreme Council of
Islamic Affairs.
   Thousands of people who wanted Abubakar's elder son, Muhammadu
Maccido, to succeed his father took to the streets and burned
several buildings to protest Dasuki's appointment.
   The protesters wore amulets and wielded daggers and chanted ``Ba
Mu So,'' which means ``We don't want'' in the Hausa language.
   Moslems constitute about 45 percent of the population of Nigeria.
   Radio Nigeria said rioters burned buildings, including that of
state-run Rima Radio and the local branch of the Luxembourg-based
Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
   Dasuki is chairman of the bank's local board.
   Soldiers and policemen cordoned off the sultan's palace and twice
beat back crowds who tried to enter.
   Radio Nigeria, quoting police sources, said 10 civilians were
killed and five policemen were seriously injured. It did not say how
the civilians died.
   Reporters in Lagos have said people believed the military
government forced the committee of Moslem elders that selected the
new sultan to choose Dasuki instead of Maccido.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   David Mamet's ``Things Change,'' the second film
directed by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, will open the
32nd London Film Festival which this year features more than 140
films from 35 countries.
   The comedy, co-starring Joe Mantegna and Don Ameche, received
raves when it opened in the United States. It kicks off the 18-day
event at a black-tie screening Thursday. Mamet's first directing
effort, ``House of Games,'' was a hit at least year's festival.
   The festival closes Nov. 27 with ``For Queen and Country,''
Martin Stellman's gritty British film starring Denzel Washington
(``Cry Freedom'').
   ``We think we have a festival of very high quality,'' festival
director Sheila Whitaker said. ``You will be able to see, whether
you like the film or not, why every film is there.''
   The United States and Britain dominate the festival lineup with
50 films between them, but movies are also included from the
Dominican Republic, Madagascar and New Zealand. Two are from Iran.
   Besides ``Things Change,'' major American films making their
local debut at the festival include ``Crossing Delancey,'' Joan
Micklin Silver's tale of a young woman's romantic tribulations in
Manhattan, starring Amy Irving; ``Die Hard,'' John McTiernan's crisp
thriller starring Bruce Willis as a New York police officer; and
Henry Winkler's ``Memories of Me,'' with Alan King and Billy Crystal
as father and son.
   Jazz musician Charlie Parker is the subject of two festival
entries: Clint Eastwood's ``Bird'' with Forest Whitaker,
much-acclaimed at the Cannes Film Festival in May and the New York
Film Festival in September, and Marc Huraux's quasi-documentary
``Bird Now,'' a Belgian-French co-production.
   Other Cannes entries to be viewed in London include Bille
August's ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' which won Cannes' top prize, the
Palme d'Or, and Krzysztof Kieslowski's Polish-language ``A Short
Film About Killing.''
   India is represented with 11 movies, including the French-English
co-production ``Salaam Bombay!'' Directed by Mira Nair, it was a
success at the Directors' Fortnight in Cannes.
   From South Africa comes Oliver Schmitz's ``Mapantsula,'' one of
the first movies directed by a black filmmaker to address apartheid.
Most major films on the topic to reach a wide audience, such as
``Cry Freedom'' and ``A World Apart,'' have been directed by whites.
   Several filmmakers will speak about their work as part of the
yearlong Guardian newspaper lecture series, which continues during
the festival. Frenchman Marcel Ophuls appears Nov. 12 to discuss his
4{-hour documentary, ``Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus
Barbie.''
   Swedish actor Max Von Sydow, starring in a London stage
production of Shakespeare's ``The Tempest,'' appears at the National
Film Theater Nov. 20 to discuss ``Katinka,'' which he directed, and
``Pelle the Conqueror,'' in which he stars.
   One of the most eagerly awaited events is a screening of D.W.
Griffith's 1916 epic, ``Intolerance,'' which will be shown Nov.
11-12 with a new score composed and conducted by Carl Davis.

   The Udall name, a household word in
Arizona and Washington political circles, remains an also-ran in New
Mexico.
   Tom Udall, the son of former Arizona congressman and Interior
Secretary Stewart Udall and nephew of Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz.,
was defeated Tuesday in his bid for New Mexico's 3rd Congressional
District seat.
   Udall, 40, lost a close race with Republican Steven Schiff, the
district attorney in Bernalillo County.
   It was the second time in six years Udall has been defeated in a
bid for a congressional assignment from New Mexico. He finished last
in a four-candidate field in the 1982 primary for the then
newly-created 3rd Congressional District seat.
   Morris Udall, meanwhile, was re-elected in Arizona.

<HEAD>One Prison Goes Down, Another Goes Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Illinois voters narrowly rejected a proposal to build a
$50 million federal prison on Pekin's south side, while residents of
an Ohio town overwhelmingly voted to allow a prison there.
   The city of Warren had agreed to pay for utility hookups to the
prison by using as much as $900,000 in city tax reserves. Tuesday's
initiative would have prevented the city from providing the hookups.
City officials had acknowledged that the state couldn't have built
the prison without the utilities.
   In Pekin, supporters had billed the prison as an economic
development resource that would provide jobs for the city of 33,500,
while opponents argued the prison would mean more crime, violence
and drugs without bringing in significant new revenue or jobs.
   They had hoped to match the success of East Peoria residents who
organized a similar campaign and defeated a prison referendum last
March.

   Two huge petroleum tanks exploded and burned
at an oil refineryy on Wednesday, killing eight people and injuring
about 35, officials said.
   Firefighters brought the blaze under control and maintained an
all-night vigil to keep it from spreading to other tanks, but flames
still could be seen nearly 12 hours after the midday explosion.
   Three nearby tanks were emptied to keep the fire from spreading
to more than 300 others in the 430-acre refinery on the northeast
edge of Bombay.
   ``There was a small explosion followed by a fire,'' said K.R.S.
Narayan, director of the refinery division of Bharat Petroelum Corp.
Ltd. ``A tank can't explode by itself. We are not ruling out
sabotage.''
   Narayan said the blast and fire blew off the roof of a tank
containing 250 tons of naphtha and a nearby tank containing 150 tons
of naphtha soon caught fire. Clouds of black smoke could be seen 12
miles away.
   Naphtha is a highly flammable liquid that, like kerosene and
gasoline, is produced through the distillation of petroleum.
   Officials said eight people died and about 35 were injured.
   ``All I heard was a big bang. By the time I turned around to see
what was happening, my shirt was on fire,'' trucker Abdul Majique
was quoted by the news agency as saying.
   The agency said he suffered burns over 20 percent of his body,
mostly on his arms and legs.

<HEAD>Solid in the South, Bush Won in Every Region, but Party Slipped</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush won the presidency with a solid South and dominated
every other region of the country, but had hardly any coattails to
offer a Republican Party that suffered losses in both houses of
Congress and in state governors' races.
   Bush not only won where he expected to do well, but beat Michael
Dukakis in big states the Democrats had coveted: California, Ohio,
Michigan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
   Dukakis won Massachusetts, the state he governs, and neighboring
New York and Rhode Island, but overall he trailed even in the
Northeast.
   Democrats made a net gain of at least one seat in the Senate,
where they have held a 54-46 advantage, and led in a tight race for
a seat from Florida. They added one seat in the House, which they
are now in control 257-178, and led in four other tight races.
   Democrats also registered a net gain of one governor's office,
giving them 28 nationally, and picked up seats in several state
legislatures.

<HEAD>Bryan's Political Career Began in High School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan's victory over an
incumbent senator caps a political career that began when he was
elected president of the student body in high school.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' Bryan exulted after he defeated GOP Sen. Chic
Hecht. ``This has been a real tough campaign.''
   Bryan has been a well-regarded governor and has demonstrated
considerable media savvy. Hours after a rocket plant exploded in
Henderson earlier this year, he appeared at Las Vegas television
stations to explain what had gone wrong.
   He is something of an independent among Democrats. He supports
strong defense spending, opposes the Equal Rights Amendment and
favors aid to the contras in Nicaragua, all of which put him outside
the Democratic mainstream.
   He has opposed plans to locate a nuclear waste dump in Nevada,
and he took a drubbing from Hecht when Gov. Michael Dukakis said he
stood by Congress's decision to locate the dump there.
   Neither Bryan nor Hecht were shy about spending money: Bryan's
victory came after the most expensive race in Nevada history, in
which the candidates spent an estimated $6 million.
   Bryan collected 50 percent of the vote to Hecht's 46 percent.
Libertarian James Frye received 1.6 percent and 2 percent of the
voters selected ``none of the above.''
   Bryan joins Sen. Harry Reid as Nevada's second Democratic
senator. His win elevates Lt. Gov. Bob Miller to acting governor to
serve out the final two years of Bryan's term.
   Bryan, 51, was elected governor in 1982 to fulfill a dream he had
since serving as president of his sophomore and senior classes at
Las Vegas High School and student body president his senior year at
the University of Nevada-Reno.
   Despite an image his detractors said was bland, Bryan
successfully fought for diversification of Nevada's
tourism-dependent economy and won significant reforms in the state's
educational system.

   INDIANA (12): Quayle country gave Bush 60 percent of the vote,
and Republican Sen. Richard Lugar did 8 points better. However, Evan
Bayh, 33, son of Sen. Birch Bayh (the man Quayle upset in the Reagan

Democrats. Bayh won 53 percent against Republican Lt. Gov. John M.
Mutz.
   IOWA (8): Dukakis by 10 percentage points.
   KANSAS (7): 57 percent for Bush.
   MICHIGAN (20): Bush won by 6 percentage points, while Democratic
Sen. Don Riegle rolled up 61 percent of the vote against former
Congressman James W. Dunn Jr.
   MINNESOTA (10): Dukakis won 54 percent, doing substantially
better thans 88,788,626, but more than 600 precincts were yet to report
final
figures. The Census Bureau estimated there were about 182,628,000
Americans eligible to vote.
   When the final figures are in, Gans expects the voter turnout to
be ``right around 50 percent,'' the lowest percentage of eligible
voters to cast ballots since the 48 percent to 49 percent total in
1924.
   ``The turnout is down in every state of the union and the
District of Columbia, with the exception of Nevada and New
Hampshire,'' Gans said. ``It's conceivable that by the time final
totals are in that Nebraska and Colorado may be up. But if they are
up, they are up marginally.''
   Gans said the turnout in 1948 was 51.1 percent and there was a
steady decline thereafter until 1980 when 52.6 percent of the
eligible electorate cast ballots. In 1984, the number was 53.1
percent.
   The 1988 race ``was a horrible election in a variety of ways,''
Gans said, ``and the people responded accordingly.''
   The low turnout was caused by a variety of factors, but the
primary reason was the conduct of the candidates, the coverage of
the campaign and the use of television advertising, he said.
   ``One candidate refused to say anything about anything but
competence and good jobs for good wages, and then refused to defend
the core values of his party,'' Gans said. ``The other candidate
nominated Dan Quayle and then engaged in fairly low forms of
demagogy without offering reasons for people to vote.''
   He blamed political and television consultants who ran the
campaigns and reduced the flow of information to ``seven-second
sound bites'' and to television commercials ``substituting for
debate.''
   ``The conduct of our campaigns has increasingly been put in the
hands of irresponsible political consultants,'' he said.
   Gans faulted the media for ``making polling a driving force in
the campaign'' and then ``writing off whole regions of the country
for one candidate.'' This, he said, discouraged vast numbers of
voters from going to the ballot box.
   He also criticized television networks for projecting the
eventual winner before polls close on the West Coast.
   ``Right now the West Coast states have by far and away the lowest
turnout,'' but final figures were not in, said Gans.

<HEAD>Afghan Leader Meets With Reagan As US Reiterates Support</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead expected by 4 p.m. EST</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Leader</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP ) _ President Reagan met Wednesday with the leader
of the Afghan resistance in an effort to dramatize U.S. support for
the rebels' drive to topple the communist government in Kabul and
oust Soviet troops.
   ``The fight of the Afghan people to regain and to preserve their
freedom has provided a lesson for free people around the world,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Reagan, meanwhile, posed for pictures in the Oval Office with
Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the Islamic Society guerrilla group.
The Afghan also met with Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   In a statement, Fitzwater sharply criticized the Soviets for
conducting bombing raids against the Mujahedeen guerrillas, who are
on the offensive against government forces. He said the attacks
``call into question Moscow's commitment not to launch offensive
operations in Afghanistan.''
   Fitzwater also indicated the rebels had U.S. approval to maintain
the pace of their offensive, which the Soviets cited last week in
suspending the withdrawal of the Red Army from the country.
   ``We have said we will continue to provide support for the
Mujahedeen as long as the Soviet Union is providing support for the
Kabul government,'' Fitzwater said. ``And we would not intervene to
direct their activities beyond that.''
   Although the amount is secret, the Reagan administration has
provided hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons to the rebels,
including shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft missiles delivered
through Pakistan.
   There were reports Rabbani would ask for additional arms, but a
U.S. official, who spoke earlier this week on condition of
anonymity, said ``they didn't come in pressing for more guns. They
are confident of their ability to see this war to its end.''
   Fitzwater said the administration was ``disappointed'' by the
Soviet decision to suspend troop withdrawals, but he said Moscow was
expected to honor its pledge to pull the last of its 100,000 or more
soldiers from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   ``The commitment of the American government and people to the
Afghan people's cause is not new, and it will not waiver,'' he said.
``It will continue as long as the Afghan people require it to regain
their freedom.''

   With the counting of ballots barely completed in
the U.S. election, bookmakers on Wednesday already were assessing
President-elect George Bush's chances of a second term _ and they
looked good.
   Bookmakers William Hill made him the 5-2 favorite for a second
term, while giving his Republican party as a whole 1-2 odds and the
Democrats 6-4 odds.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., led the field of Democratic contenders
with 6-1 odds followed by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo at 8-1.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, who lost to Bush after a
grueling campaign, was given 20-1 odds, the same as the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who lost the Democratic nomination.
   Actor Clint Eastwood, a former mayor of Carmel, Calif., had 33-1
odds and any woman has 100-1 odds.
   The 5-2 odds on Bush means that if the president-elect wins a
second term, a bet of $2 would win $5 plus the original stake.

<TEXT>
   Residents who had to haul water from a
faucet at the elementary school for three years because their
shallow wells were contaminated say they have learned too well how
precious is pure drinking water.
   Nearly a year after 250 families in the farming town of 1,500
people got together on their own time to build a $4 million water
system, they still show off to visitors their 500,000-gallon storage
tank and basement meters.
   And there are few complaints about the cost _ $3,500 to $5,000
for a connection plus about $300 a year.
   ``We get our water bill, we pay it and we are happy,'' said Irene
Hoynoski.
   About three-quarters of the families signed up for the service in
the town on the Connecticut River in western Massachusetts about 30
miles north of Springfield.
   ``The cost? It's worth it just for the peace of mind,'' said
Eileen Haffey. She was pregnant when the family discovered the house
they had just bought had contaminated water.
   She said her children got so used to bad water that they
automatically asked if they could drink the water when out of town.
   Frank Marchand, chairman of the town Water Resource Protection
Committee, said cars lined up at the elementary school day and night
for water from the outside tap.
   ``I remember there was one poor woman with a station wagon who
came every two days and filled up so many gallon milk jugs that they
stretched from the front seat all the way to the back window,'' he
said. ``She must have had to fill up 50 to 60 jugs every two days.''
   The two major contaminants in the residents' wells were ethylene
dibromide, used on the tobacco fields, and Temik, used on potatoes,
said John Higgins, regional engineer for the state Department of
Environmental Quality Engineering.
   ``But with such shallow wells _ most were six to eight feet deep
_ we could find just about any agricultural chemical we tested
for,'' Higgins said.
   ``Whately is a little unique,'' he said. ``There are small areas
in towns all over the state where shallow wells have become
contaminated. But it's not usual to find it affecting half the
town.''
   The town actually had access to abundant water beneath a
50-foot-thick, protective layer of clay. But residents opted to try
a municipal system with one 190-foot-deep well for fear that the
deep aquifer would become contaminated as well if everyone drilled
through the clay layer, he said.
   The town has no full-time employees, so the water system was all
volunteer labor.
   ``The most amazing thing about Whately is how the community came
and worked together,'' Higgins said. ``Everybody had other jobs and
yet they got that system built as fast as a city that was paying
people full-time to work on the program.
   Money was hard to get. Paul Fleuriel, chairman of the town water
commission, boasts: ``We bullied the state into helping.''
   After three years of negotiations, he managed to wrest from the
state nearly $1.5 million in grants. The rest was covered by town
borrowing and the connection fees.
   Marchand said he would never forget the April 1987 night the
water district was approved by Town Meeting.
   ``It needed a two-thirds majority vote and it got that by one
vote. It was that close,'' he said. ``There were tears streaming out
of people's eyes.''

   Republican Frank F. Fasi has won his fifth term
as mayor of Honolulu, turning back a stiff challenge from Democrat
Marilyn Bornhorst.
   Fasi, 68, advertised heavily during the campaign, stressing his
16 years of administrative experience and amassing a war chest of
more than $2 million.
   First elected in 1968 as a Democrat, Fasi has served continuously
since then except between 1980 and 1984, when he lost in the
Democratic primary to Eileen Anderson, who went on to become mayor.
He regained the office in 1984 as a Republican.
   Bornhorst, a community activist from Makiki, served on the City

<HEAD>Voters Reject Super City Idea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK ISLAND, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in five Rock Island County towns
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to merge into Illinois'
fourth-largest city, despite projected savings of $4 million and
promises of increased political clout.
   The proposal called on residents of Rock Island, Moline, East
Moline, Coal Valley and Hampton to put aside their differences and
link their populations and geographic areas in the fight for
economic revitalization.
   Passage would have created a new community, dubbed Quad City.
   Rock Island Mayor Robert Millett revived the ``super city''
concept about two years ago in a bid to shake the rust-belt blues
and get the attention of the nation's business community.
   A university study estimated taxpayers would save more than $4
million by unifying police, fire, water and sewer, snow-removal
services and purchasing.
   But community pride overcame the touted benefits and voters
refused to give up their hometowns. Merger opponents played on those
loyalties, running newspaper ads showing the names of the five
cities on gravestones.

<HEAD>Bell Goes Back To British</HEAD>

   In a show of good will similar to that
the British Navy showed when it gave a ship bell to Campbelltown,
residents of the central Pennsylvania town have voted to return the
bell to its original owners.
   The referendum won by a narrow 346 to 341 Tuesday.
   The 50-pound shiny brass bell originally hung on a destroyer _
the HMS Campbeltown _ given to Britain by the United States in 1940
to bolster that country's naval defense in World War II, town
officials said. It has been displayed outside their fire hall since
1950, when it was presented to the town by British officials.
   Britain has asked the community to return the bell for a new ship
that will be completed in 1989.

   Aldridge, 50, who has been praised widely for his work in helping
the Air Force recover from the space shuttle Challenger disaster,
said in a statement he had accepted an offer to become the president
of a newly created subsidiary of the McDonnell Douglas Corp., a
major space and military contractor.
   President-elect George Bush has promised to bring a new team of
officials into his administration, and according to defense sources,
there never has been any doubt that the top civilian jobs heading
the Air Force, Navy and Army would change hands.
   Aldridge, a native of Houston who grew up in Shreveport, La.,
said he would depart his job Dec. 16. Air Force Undersecretary James
McGovern will assume the duties on a temporary basis, the Pentagon
said.
   In his letter of resignation to President Reagan, Aldridge
thanked Reagan for providing him ``the most rewarding experience of
my career,'' adding the administration had built ``what is
undoubtedly the greatest Air Force in the world.''
   Aldridge said he would remain in the Washington area to assume
the presidency of the McDonnell Douglas Electronic Systems Co.
   McDonnell Douglas, headquartered in St. Louis, is the nation's
largest defense contractor. It announced just a week ago plans to
split its third-largest unit, the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics
Co., into three new companies.
   Besides the Electronic Systems Co., the other companies created
were the McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. and the McDonnell
Douglas Missile Systems Co. The subsidiary that Aldridge will head
is responsible for the company's electronics work and command,
control, communications and intelligence systems businesses.
   Aldridge, who has served in the Reagan administration for 7{
years and as the secretary of the Air Force since the summer of
1986, held a number of management posts with McDonnell Douglas in
the 1960s. An aeronautical engineer by training, he also has held
private industry jobs with the LTV Aerospace Corp. and the Systems
Planning Corp.
   Aldridge worked in a number of Pentagon posts in the 1970s,
serving at one point as an advisor to the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks in Helsinki and Vienna.
   His tenure as Air Force secretary has been marked by a largely
successful effort to rebuild the service's unmanned space program
and nagging complaints about the service's management of the B-1B
bomber program.
   Aldridge insisted _ and Congress ultimately agreed _ the Air
Force had to start building new unmanned rockets to ensure access to
space in the wake of the Challenger tragedy.
   While Aldridge and Air Force brass maintain the B-1B is the best
long-range bomber in the world, the General Accounting Office has
criticized the service's management of the program. The GAO
maintains the bomber may never meet contract specifications for
radar-jamming capability and is frequently grounded for maintenance.

   The Democrats rose above the Republican tide that carried George
Bush to victory, registering a net gain of one governor's office out
of 12 races, including the top spot in vice president-elect Dan
Quayle's state.
   Twenty-eight of the 50 governorships now are in Democratic hands,
putting the party in good position to influence the congressional
redistricting battles expected to be waged in state legislatures
after the 1990 census.
   ``Historically the party that wins the White House has picked up
some governor's seats. This year they had that loss of one,''
Charles H. Dolan Jr., executive director of the Democratic
Governors' Association, said Wednesday. ``I think there were
absolutely no coattails on George Bush and Dan Quayle.''
   Voters on Tuesday ended 20-year control over the governor's
office by Republicans in Indiana and by Democrats in Montana and
soundly rejected Republican Arch Moore's bid for a fourth term in
West Virginia in favor of a political novice.
   They also narrowly re-elected embattled Republicans in Utah and
Rhode Island.
   GOP incumbents won more easily in Delaware, Missouri and North
Carolina, and a new Republican replaced an old one in New Hampshire.
Democratic incumbents were returned by wide margins in North Dakota,
Vermont and Washington.
   Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors
Association, said she was ``just delighted'' by the outcome,
``especially after we had the Democrats out there crowing that they
were going to get four'' seats, in Rhode Island, Utah, West Virginia
and Indiana.
   The Republican victories in Utah and Montana were a ``clear sign
that there was a positive coattail effect for George Bush, but
frankly those are the only two states where I saw that,'' Ms. Davis
said. Bush won both states.
   Evan Bayh was elected the nation's youngest governor at 32,
defeating Republican Lt. Gov. John M. Mutz, 53 percent to 47
percent, despite a landslide for the Bush-Quayle ticket in Indiana,
Quayle's backyard and a GOP stronghold.
   ``I'm feeling a whole lot older right now. It's been a long
campaign,'' said Bayh, Indiana secretary of state and the son of
former Sen. Birch E. Bayh, who lost his Senate seat to Quayle in
1980. The youngest governor in office is Ray Mabus of Mississippi,
who is 40.
   Bayh _ who ran on a program of fiscal austerity while his
opponent questioned his experience and his sincerity in seeking
office _ said his triumph constitutes ``the vigorous return of the
two-party system here.''
   Republican Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island overcame allegations of
unethical conduct in his private and public business dealings to win
re-election in a cliffhanger, 51 percent to 49 percent. He defeated
communications executive Bruce Sundlun for the second time in two
years.
   ``These past few months have given me a renewed appreciation for
your basic sense of fairness, and you are a fair people,'' the
governor said. The Sundlun campaign said it may seek a recount after
16,000 absentee ballots are counted.
   Republican Norm Bangerter's re-election in Utah robbed the
Democrats of what they regarded as a sure thing. Bangerter,
stigmatized by a record $166 million tax increase, battled back from
a 30-point deficit in the polls. He overtook Democrat Ted Wilson,
former mayor of Salt Lake City, 40 percent to 38 percent.
Independent Merrill Cook, running on a tax-limitation platform, drew
21 percent.
   In West Virginia, Moore, a 65-year-old political warhorse and the
only incumbent unseated Tuesday, was routed by Democrat Gaston
Caperton, 59 percent to 41 percent. An insurance executive who
framed the election as a referendum on Moore and West Virginia's
ailing economy, Caperton called the outcome ``a great victory for
those of us who want change.''
   ``The people of West Virginia have been very kind over the years
to the Moore family in our public service. We believe as a family we
gave them our heart and soul and all the years of our service,''
Moore said in conceding.
   In Montana, former GOP state Sen. Stan Stephens wrecked a
comeback attempt by one-time Gov. Thomas Judge in a battle over how
to rejuvenate the state's troubled farm and railroad economy.
Stephens won the seat being vacated by Democrat Ted Schwinden by a
margin of 53 percent to 47 percent
   Nine incumbents _ six Republicans and three Democrats _ were on
the ballot. Indiana's Robert D. Orr was barred by law from a third
term; Schwinden and New Hampshire Republican John Sununu are
retiring.

<HEAD>Iran Agrees To Nov. 20 For POW Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran on Wednesday accepted a Red Cross proposal to
begin exchanging disabled war prisoners with Iraq on Nov. 20.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, made the
announcement after meeting with Jan Eliasson, the U.N. mediator in
the Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   Eliasson met earlier with the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
who did not immediately announce his response.
   The countries have a total of 1,569 disabled prisoners captured
during the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980. Red Cross
spokesman Juerg Bischof said the agency has registered 1,158 in Iran
and 411 in Iraq.
   The Geneva talks are aimed at consolidating a cease-fire that
took effect Aug. 20. A new face-to-face session is scheduled
Thursday.
   Bischof said technical talks on how to proceed with the prisoner
exchange are under way. He said the Nov. 20 date will give officials
time to make preparations, such as chartering a plane that may have
to be specially equipped to transport the wounded.
   Iraq announced Tuesday that it was ready to begin immediately
with the repatriation of wounded Iranians the Red Cross has
identified in Iraqi camps, provided Iran also agrees to send home
disabled Iraqi POWs.
   Iran said Oct. 21 that it was prepared to release the wounded
``should Iraq be willing to reciprocate.''
   In a note to both governments Oct. 4, the Red Cross encouraged
repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners and the registration of
all prisoners, estimated to total more than 100,000, ``as a matter
of priority.''
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi POWs in Iran and 19,284
Iranians in Iraq, but it estimates each side holds another 20,000 to
30,000. It has urged both governments to supply complete lists and
insists that all prisoners be interviewed by Red Cross delegates to
make sure repatriation is voluntary.
   In the U.N.-mediated peace talks that began Aug. 25, Iraq has
been pressing for the release and repatriation of all POWs,
independent of negotiations on consolidating the truce.
   Iran insists that such global release be linked to other
provisions in the U.N. cease-fire resolution. It urges that priority
be given to the withdrawal of forces to ``internationally recognized
borders.''
   That border is disputed since Iraq, a few days before the
outbreak of the war, repudiated a 1975 treaty delineating it. The
issue has stalled the peace talks since August.

<HEAD>West Virginia's Next Governor Says Business Experience Was
Important</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Virginia's next governor
acknowledges he lacks political experience but says his business
successes show he has vision and can inspire passion in people.
   A jubilant Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton, who upset three-term Gov.
Arch Moore by 59 percent to 41 percent, said he was ``proud of what
my background is and I'm proud of what I've learned from my family.''
   Caperton, 48, built his family business, McDonough Caperton
Insurance Group, into the nation's 18th largest insurance company.
When he assumed control from his father and his uncle, it had 12
employees. Eighteen years later it has nearly 500.
   His business background ``distinguishes me as a person who had
vision, who's worked very, very hard (and) who's been able to
attract and motivate highly capable people,'' he said.
   Few observers thought Caperton had a chance in his first bid for
elective office when he announced he was running for governor on a
Democratic ticket already packed with veteran politicians.
   Despite his lack of government experience, he won the endorsement
of the United Mine Workers and the state's largest teacher's union.
   He put together a campaign organization that included experienced
politicians, such as state Sen. Lloyd Jackson II, the scion of an
old-style political family in southern West Virginia.
   He's married to former Miss West Virginia Dee Caperton, a state
delegate who gave up her legislative seat to help her husband
campaign. They have two sons.
   Caperton, who had spent $3.8 million on the race with 10 days
until the election, makes no apologies for using his wealth,
although he won't say how much he's worth.

   Democratic Vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen was flying
back to Washington from Texas. He won a new term in the Senate, and
as chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, will spend
the next two years negotiating with the Republican administration on
issues such as taxes and trade.
   Bush and the new Congress began warming up to each other,
although no one was underestimating the differences after a long and
bruising campaign.
   ``The question is whether there will be a honeymoon. ...
Certainly there will be considerable confict between their agenda
and our agenda,'' said Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, who
spearheaded the losing Republican campaign to win control of the
Senate.
   ``Look, there's no hard feelings,'' said the president-elect.
   ``Most of us have know George Bush for a long time,'' replied
Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
He said he spoke for all Democratic chairmen in saying he was
``prepared to work with President Bush and do that straight up, no
holds barred and find whether he means what he says when he says
that he expects to have a close relationship with the Senate and the
House.''
   Whatever else happened, the senators knew that Bush carried most
of their states. He won 40 of them _ and nine of the 11 largest _
inluding California, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Florida.
   Dukakis carried New York, Massachusetts and eight other states as
well as the District of Columbia.
   The race to pick a new Senate power broker was under way in
earnest. Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd was giving up his
leadership post in the new Congress, and J. Bennett Johnston of
Louisiana, George Mitchell of Maine and Daniel Inouye of Hawaii were
in a race to succeed him.
   That figured to be a campaign as tough as any waged this year,
and with a tiny number of registered voters _ the ranks of
Democratic senators in the new Congress.
   Speaker Jim Wright of Texas was re-elected without opposition and
will lead the Democrats in the new House.
   All in all it was an election that treated incumbents kindly, yet
one that produced its fair share of fresh faces.
   The new senators included Joseph Lieberman in Connecticut, a
Democrat who ended Lowell Weicker's maverick career after three
terms. Former Govs. Charles Robb in Virginia and Robert Kerrey in
Nebraska turned Republican Senate seats into Democratic ones. Gov.
Richard Bryan of Nevada ousted freshman GOP Sen. Chic Hecht in
Nevada.
   Herbert Kohl was elected Wisconsin's new Democratic senator.
   Conrad Burns in Montana was the only Republican to defeat a
Senate Democratic incumbent. He beat John Melcher, seeking a third
term.
   Other newly elected Republicans in the Senate included Rep. Trent
Lott from Mississippi and Rep. James Jeffords from Vermont, both of
whom won open seats. Slade Gorton of Washington, defeated in a
re-election bid two years ago, mounted a successful comeback.
   One Republican, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, squeaked to a new
term.
   Though a few House incumbents remained locked in tough races on
the afternoon after the election, that didn't change the overall
picture. Incumbency was practically a guarantee of victory.
   The few exceptions to the rule included Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, a 14-term veteran and chairman of the House Banking
Committee. Beset by charges of ethical lapses, he fell to political
newcomer Ronald Machtley.
   Three Republican incumbents were turned out of office, including
Pat Swindall in Georgia, who was defeated by Ben Jones. Swindall
faces perjury charges.
   Other GOP incumbents who fell included freshman Jack Davis in
Illinois and Mac Sweeney in Texas.
   Democrats picked up statehouse offices formerly held by
Republicans, including Indiana where 32-year-old Evan Bayh wrested
control from the Republicans for the first time in 20 years. Gaston
Caperton ousted GOP Gov. Arch Moore in West Virginia.
   Republicans countered with one takeaway of their own when Stan
Stephens won the Montana statehouse for the GOP for the first time
in 16 years.
   Two Republican incumbents survived close calls.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete overcame allegations of unethical conduct in
Rhode Island to defeat a Democratic businessman for the second time
in two years, while fellow Republican Norm Bangerter was re-elected
in Utah.
   Republican Rep. Judd Gregg stepped up to the New Hampshire
governor's office.

   Despite the defeat of Michael Dukakis,
Democrats on Wednesday expanded their majority in the House of
Representatives, where 99 percent of incumbents seeking re-election
were returned to office.
   The day after the elections, three House races were still too
close to call. But all three were led by Democrats, who would end up
with a net gain of five seats if they held those leads.
   Democrats took 259 of the 435 House seats. Republicans held 173
seats, down from 178 in the last Congress.
   That the Democrats kept their majority was no surprise to
analysts in either party. Even Republican incumbents fared well,
with 158 of 163 GOP veterans returning for another two years.
   Overall, 401 of the 408 House members who sought re-election got
their wish. That's a 99 percent success rate for incumbents,
surpassing the previous record of 98 percent in 1986.
   Surprises were few.
   In Rhode Island, Democratic Rep. Fernand St Germain, the chairman
of the Banking Committee, was upset by Republican attorney Ronald
Machtley, ending St Germain's 14-term career in the House. Next in
seniority to become chairman of the committee is Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, who won 72 percent of the vote to defeat his
Republican challenger.
   St Germain, who had been the subject of an earlier ethics
investigation, suffered another blow just two weeks before the
election, when a five-month-old Justice Department letter was
unsealed. The letter referred to ``substantial evidence of serious
and sustained misconduct'' by St Germain for allegedly accepting
favors from lobbyists.
   An ethics issue also helped bring down Rep. Pat Swindall, R-Ga.,
who lost to Ben Jones, a Democrat who once played the role of Cooter
on television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard.'' The bitter campaign
focused on Swindall's election-eve perjury indictment in a drug
money laundering case, and on Jones' past arrests and alcohol
problems.
   There were these lingering undecided contests Wednesday:
   _In Florida's 4th District, Democratic Rep. William V. Chappell
Jr., held about a 1,000-vote lead over Republican Craig T. James
with all but absentee ballots counted.
   _In New York State, with 95 percent of ballots counted,
Democratic challenger Nita Lowey was about 2,000 votes ahead of
incumbent Republican Joseph J. DioGuardi, who was seeking a third
term.
   _In Oregon, Democratic challenger Michael Kopetski led incumbent
Republican Denny Smith by less than 1,300 votes, with some absentee
ballots remaining.
   The only other incumbents denied re-election were freshman
Republican Rep. Jack Davis of Illinois, defeated by former state
Sen. George Sangmeister, and Republican Rep. Mac Sweeney of Texas,
defeated by Democrat Greg Laughlin.
   When the 101st Congress convenes in January, it will mark the
35th consecutive year of Democratic control, and with it, control of
more than two dozen committees and the speaker's chair.
   ``We knew we were going to have a tough row to hoe this year,''
said Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, R-Mich., chaieed for massive changes.''
   Vander Jagt said the fact that 99 percent of the incumbents
seeking re-election won ``demonstrates the awesome power of
incumbency.''
   Vander Jagt's Democratic counterpart, Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark.,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said
voters preferred Democratic policies in Congress. ``They gave us
their vote of confidence,'' Anthony said.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois also cited the
``incredible'' amount of money available to incumbents.
   According to campaign finance reports filed before Election Day,
House incumbents had collected $151 million in contributions,
compared to $32 million for their opponents.
   The most expensive of the House contests was the battle for the
19th District of California, where Republican Rep. Robert
Lagomarsino held on to beat Democratic state Sen. Gary K. Hart _ no
relation to former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart _ to win by just over
2,000 votes.
   Between them, Lagomarsino and Hart spent an estimated $2.3
million to capture the district that will be President Reagan's home
when he returns to California.

   President-elect George Bush appeared to be the
world's favorite winner, and he was welcomed Wednesday as a man of
experience in world affairs who will uphold commitments of the
Reagan administration.
   The Soviet Union said it expects to be able to work for peace and
disarmament with Bush. China cited his wide experience and predicted
he would follow Reagan's policies, but not ``blindly.'' NATO praised
his commitment to the Western defense alliance.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a message of
congratulations, saying he was ``ready to continue and deepen
mutually beneficial Soviet-American cooperation'' and work with Bush
on ``improvement of the entire international situation.''
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said an early summit was
possible.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher offered her ``staunch support.''
She said his ``unrivaled experience of government will be a unique
asset for NATO and will enable America to continue to give the
strong leadership the West needs.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, Reagan's most supportive Western ally, stayed up
through the night watching results on TV and emerged from her home
to tell reporters she wanted to be the first to congratulate Bush.
   Vatican radio said American voters chose the ``more secure path''
and the result was a sign of continuity.
   Bush's selection of his friend and campaign manager James A.
Baker III as secretary of state came as no surprise and won general
approval.
   Foreign officials, particularly diplomats, dislike commenting on
the internal affairs of another country, but a West German official
called Baker ``a good choice'' and a French diplomatic source
described him as ``very professional.'' Both spoke on condtiion of
anonymity.
   A few discordant notes were found in the favorable chorus of
comment about Bush.
   Tehran radio in Iran said the ``true rulers'' of the United
States pursues ``suppression and plunder'' of the Third World
whether the president is a Republican or Democrat.
   In Greece, ancestral homeland of Dukakis, the left-wing afternoon
daily Eleftherotypia reported the results under the headline: ``The
Miracle Didn't Happen, Dukakis Lost.''
   Le Soleil, the daily of the governing Socialist Party in Senegal,
said: ``The defeat of the Democrat Michael Dukakis will be like a
broken dream for Africans. We saw in Michael Dukakis a new
Democratic president who would declare South Africa a terrorist
state as he promised.''
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha of South Africa said: ``It is in the
interest of the whole southern Africa region that a realist like Mr.
Bush was elected.''
   Bush has said he would not press for tougher economic sanctions
against South Africa, which Dukakis had pledged to do.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, a Dukakis friend of
long standing, said she hoped relations with Washington would be
strengthened. Rep. Ramon Mitra, speaker of the House of
Representatives, said Bush must dispel a view in the Philippines
that he is unsympathetic to Mrs. Aquino's government.
   Optimism was evident in Latin America, where controversy has
surrounded Reagan administration policies.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua was quoted in the newspaper
El Nuevo Diario as saying a Bush administration could open the way
to negotiations and improved relations with the United States.
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace
Prize for his work on a Central American peace agreement, said: ``I
expect big support from Bush for our plan, because we do not believe
in war. We believe in dialogue as a way to find a real peace in
Central America.''
   Fernando Belaunde, former president of Peru, said Bush seems
``profoundly interested in the problems of Latin America.''
   In Mexico, hope was expressed that Bush would soften U.S. policy
toward Latin America.
   Arab leaders and commentators said the president-elect's
experience in foreign affairs could help resolve the Arab-Israeli
confict and other regional problems.
   Hani Khasawmeh, information minister of Jordan, said his
government hoped Bush could ``change the course of history and be
able to achieve peace in this area.''
   Ahmed Abderrahmane, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, expressed hope Bush's election would put ``greater
spirit'' into the Middle East peace process and advance creation of
an independent Palestinian state.
   In Israel, where inconclusive elections were held Nov. 1, both
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
looked forward to continuity. Peres said he expects a new Mideast
initiative from Washington.
   Widespread satisfaction was expressed in such major Asian trading
centers as Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand Bush would continue
U.S. free trade policies.
   British bookmakers already were making Bush the 5-2 favorite for
a second term. Odds against Michael Dukakis were 20-1, well behind
such other Democrats as Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey (6-1) and
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York (8-1).

<TEXT>
   Democrat Joseph I. Lieberman, who narrowly
defeated incumbent Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in Connecticut, says
he's an independent who agrees with President-elect George Bush on
some foreign policy and law enforcement issues.
   Weicker, on the other hand, has a record as a maverick liberal
Republican.
   All of which led one newspaper headline writer to wonder about
Weicker, ``Aren't He and Rival in the Wrong Parties?''
   Lieberman, who defeated Weicker by less than 5,000 votes out of
more than 1.3 million cast, has managed to define himself as both a
populist and a conservative. In his five years as attorney general,
he has seized popular issues by taking legal action against
polluters and fraudulent charities.
   Yet he remains a conservative on many of the issues he is likely
to address as the state's new senator.
   ``Certainly I'll vote with the Democrats, but I'm an independent
individual,'' he said Wednesday. ``And on certain foreign policy
issues, law enforcement, some tradition value issues, I'm going to
vote my conscience. And if occasionally I vote with President-elect
Bush, don't be too surprised. But I'm a Democrat and I'm proud of
it.''
   With 100 percent of precincts reporting Tuesday, Lieberman edged
Weicker by 678,191 votes, or 49.8 percent, to 669,983 votes, or 49.2
percent. A recount appears likely because of the closeness of the
vote.
   ``That's a question that the lawyers are working on,'' Lieberman
said. ``It's an argument about state law. We actually think that
there's not a need for a recount, but we'll see as the day goes on.''
   When the 46-year-old Yale Law School graduate announced he would
challenge Weicker, the three-term incumbent and Connecticut's senior
senator, many thought he had been given bad advice.
   Early polls seemed to confirm that, showing Weicker with a
24-point lead. By mid-October, Lieberman had pulled even with
Weicker in the polls, thanks in part to clever campaign ads
depicting the burly Weicker as a sleeping bear who missed key Senate
votes.
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew who refused to campaign on the
Sabbath, also gained the support of such well-known conservatives as
William F. Buckley Jr. by favoring hard-line viewpoints that Weicker
opposed, such as the Reagan administration's invasion of Grenada.

   Voters threw out a pair of congressmen
entangled in ethics problems, but kept the House of Representatives
under solid Democratic control for the 35th straight year.
   As the last votes were being counted early today, the same voters
who elected Republican George Bush as president padded a Democratic
margin in the House that had stood at 255-177 in the 100th Congress
with three vacancies.
   It was the first time in 28 years that the party losing the
presidency still managed to gain ground in the House. By early
today, Democrats had won 259 seats and led for three others,
compared to 173 Republican victories.
   The enormous financial and other advantages that incumbents
possess proved the key dynamic in Tuesday's voting. Ninety-nine
percent of the 408 representatives seeking new terms were on their
way to re-election early today, surpassing the 1986 high-water mark
for electoral success by House officeholders of 98 percent.
   Democrats claimed the results proved that voters preferred their
policies, with Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman
Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., saying, ``They gave us their vote of
confidence.''
   Republicans contested that. House Minority Leader Bob Michel said
the amount of money incumbents raise has become ``incredible.''
   Whatever caused the incumbent tide, it was not enough to pull at
least four legislators to victory.
   Fourteen-term Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the
House Banking Committee, was beaten by GOP attorney Ronald Machtley.
Just two weeks before Election Day, a 5-month-old Justice Department
letter had been unsealed, referring to ``substantial evidence of
serious and sustained misconduct'' by St Germain for allegedly
accepting favors from lobbyists.
   The department has referred its findings to the House ethics
committee, which has yet to say what it will do.
   ``Believe me, I wanted to be re-elected, but I am looking forward
to all of a sudden spending a little time with my wife and my two
daughters,'' said St Germain, 60.
   The last chairman of a House panel to be defeated was Oregon Rep.
Al Ullman, who headed the Ways and Means Committee until his 1980
loss. Rep. Henry Gonzales, D-Texas, is likely to succeed St Germain
as banking chairman.
   In suburban Atlanta, Ben Jones, a Democrat who portrayed Cooter
on television's ``The Dukes of Hazzard,'' ousted two-term Republican
Rep. Pat Swindall in one of the country's most bitter campaigns.
   The campaign centered on Jones' past arrests and alcohol
problems, and Swindall's election-eve perjury indictment in a drug
money laundering case. Swindall took his defeat with a smile, while
Jones led his supporters in a rendition of ``Amazing Grace.''
   The only other incumbents denied re-election were freshman
Republican Rep. Jack Davis of Illinois, defeated by former state
Sen. George Sangmeister, and Republican Rep. Mac Sweeney of Texas,
defeated by Democrat Greg Laughlin.
   Democrats had more to smile about in Texas. State Sen. Bill
Sarpalius beat GOP hopeful Larry Milner for the Panhandle seat
vacated by Republican Beau Boulter, who lost his bid for the Senate.
   Democrats also scooped up a vacant seat prevously held by a
Republican in Nebraska when former state Sen. Peter Hoagland
defeated Jerry Schenken, a doctor, in one of the country's most
expensive House races. The two candidates raised $1.7 million
between them in their fight for the district that had been
represented by Rep. Hal Daub, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate.
   The GOP struck back in Florida, grabbing the north central seat
left vacant by Democratic Rep. Buddy MacKay, who was running for the
Senate. Republican businessman Cliff Stearns defeated state House
Speaker Jon Mills for the seat.
   Two lawmakers whose names came up during the federal probe into
fraud at the Pentagon found themselves locked in tight races.
Ten-term Rep. Bill Chappell, D-Fla., was leading Republican Craig
James by 1,812 votes with all but the absentee ballots counted.
   In Maryland, Democratic Rep. Roy Dyson, retained his seat by an
eyelash. He led Republican Wayne Gilchrest by about 1,500 votes with
all but 1 percent of the precincts counted. Dyson also received
negative publicity this year when his top aide killed himself after
revelations of unusual personal demands he had made on male staff
workers.
   In the country's only legitimate three-way battle, Republican
Peter Smith became Vermont's sole House member, edging out
Burlington mayor Bernard Sanders, a socialist, by 42-39 percent.
Democrat Paul Poirier finished with 19 percent.
   The most expensive contest in the nation _ a $2.3 million affair
_ was in the Santa Barbara, Calif., district that will be President
Reagan's home when he leaves the White House in January. GOP Rep.
Robert Lagomarsino, a seven-term incumbent, held off Democratic
state Sen. Gary K. Hart _ no relation to former Colorado Sen. Gary
Hart _ to win by just over 2,000 votes.
   New York Democrat Nita Lowey faced a 2-1 fund-raising
disadvantage in a $2.2 million fight with two-term GOP Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi in Westchester County, but was leading him by about 2,300
votes with 5 percent of the vote outstanding. Absentee ballots
delayed a final tally.
   Donald Payne, D-N.J., elected to replace the retired Rep. Peter
Rodino, brought the number of blacks in the House to 23, one more
than the previous record. And the victory of Democrat Jolene Unsoeld
of Washington state boosted the number of women in the chamber
beyond the current all-time mark of 23.
   Democrats started the day with enormous advantages. Of 27 open
seats _ where turnover usually occurs _ only 12 were previously
Democratic. And of 81 lawmakers with no major party opposition, only
20 were Republicans.
   The last time a party winning the presidential race lost ground
in the House was in 1960, when Democrats lost 20 seats even though
John F. Kennedy won the White House.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein has taken on
William F. Buckley Jr. on the conservative columnist's turf.
   In the latest exchange between the two, Bernstein wrote an open
letter to the columnist that ran Wednesday in the Daily News of New
York, which syndicates Buckley. ``Your column,'' Bernstein told
Buckley, ``... is beneath your dignity.''
   The spat began when Bernstein, in an Oct. 30 opinion essay in The
New York Times, decried efforts to besmirch the word ``liberalism.''
   ``Liberal is a word soiled by the greedy, reactionary,
back-looking impulse toward tyranny,'' Bernstein said.
   Buckley retaliated in a Nov. 2 colalistic two-term president in times
of peace and prosperity.
   But a selective profile could just as easily fit the image of
Michael J. Dukakis. Van Buren was a short, liberal Democrat, a
former Northeast governor with strong ethnic roots. And unlike Bush,
he was not born to the privilege so ridiculed by his critics.
   A dozen incumbent vice presidents have succeeded their bosses,
but only four by election. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the
nation's second and third presidents, were the first two.
   Some called the long drought which kept the second fiddles from
moving to the first string the ``Van Buren jinx.'' But most
historians say that difficulty winning a presidential election
simply goes with the vice presidential turf.
   ``When you're vice president, you don't stand on your own,'' said
Bruce Stewart, superintendent of the Martin Van Buren National
Historic Site in Van Buren's native Kinderhook, 130 miles north of
New York City. ``You're always associated with someone else. You're
linked more with the outgoing president than as your own man.''
   And voters' typical desire for change has kept most incumbent
deputies out of the White House, noted Stewart, who oversees
Linderwald, the mansion to which Van Buren in 1840.
   Van Buren, a Dutchman, helped found the Democratic Party, and his
behind-the-scenes dealing built the foundation for today's
convention and electioneering process, Stewart said.
   But Van Buren's Democratic ``liberalism'' of the 1830s would fit
today at
   desk of Ronald Reagan, said George Berndt, a historian at
Lindenwald, which is run by the National Park Service. ``To a large
extent, Van Buren believed in the policies of the present Republican
Party,'' he said.
   For example, Van Buren's was a strong advocate of states' rights,
feeling that the federal government should not intrude on social
issues.
   For Van Buren, the charge that he had little regard for common
people dug deep, said Donald Cole, a historian in Exeter, N.H., who
specializes in the Jackson era.
   ``Van Buren was considered kind of feminine, aristocratic,'' said
Cole, whose book, ``Martin Van Buren and the American Political
System,'' was published by Princeton University Press. ``His
opponents liked to say he drank wine out of fancy cups.''
   That even became part of the opposing Whig battle cry in 1840,
when Van Buren lost his re-election bid to William Henry Harrison,
said Michael Henderson, assistant curator at Lindenwald.
   Harrison forces used the slogan, ``Would you rather have a goblet
of champagne or a glass of cider?'' to imply that Harrison, born in
a log cabin, was closer to the electorate than the genteel Van Buren.
   Van Buren was born a tavern keeper's son among the Dutch settlers
in Kinderhook. He built his wealth from a law practice fashioned
after long apprenticeships.
   Van Buren was Jackson's campaign manager in 1828 and the top
adviser in the president's ``Kitchen Cabinet'' through his two
terms, Berndt said. He was Jackson's hand-picked successor.
   While Bush exults in matching Van Buren's accomplishment, there's
another ``jinx'' associated with the little Dutchman he has yet to
overcome. Van Buren got beat, by William Henry Harrison, when he ran
for re-election.

   In the last two days of the campaign, deputy press
secretary Steve Akey was given to answering the telephone with
``Catch the Wave,'' half a joke, half a prayer that some late-hour
surge of voter support would sweep Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis into the White House.
   It was that quiet hope that kept Akey going Tuesday, talking
about impossible combinations that could lead to election victory.
   ``There's still a shot. The arithmetic isn't blocked yet,'' he
said. Later, he insisted: ``By no means is it impossible.''
   But in the end, he admitted his optimism was borne of love for
his 20-month job, like petting an old dog that is going to die soon.
   ``It didn't go our way,'' he said as the TV networks' numbers
conspired against his dream. ``But I still feel good about the
effort. It's like nothing I've ever done and I wouldn't trade that
experience for anything.''
   Akey and his staff's last stand took place at 105 Chauncy Street,
a half-renovated building on the edge of Boston's ``Combat Zone'' of
seedy bars, topless joints and porn movie houses.
   The press office of the Dukakis-Bentsen Committee, occupying half
the second floor, consisted of 20 full-time staffers, 10 to 15
volunteers and a clutter of computers, television sets, copying and
fax machines, newspaper clippings, pictures and posters.
   The boyish-looking Akey, a political veteran at 27, was working
for the Dukakis campaign before there was an official campaign. He
gave up a safe spot in the Massachusetts governor's press office and
took the campaign job on April Fool's Day 1987, nearly a month
before Dukakis announced his candidacy.
   Since then, Akey has traveled to 30 states. He has endured the
blazing heat and frigid cold of Iowa's summer and winter. He has
survived sleepless nights, too much pizza and irritable reporters.
   He fought off a 103-degree fever and laryngitis during the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta in July, only to fall
asleep, sick and exhausted, in the middle of Dukakis' acceptance
speech.
   ``I woke up and it was over,'' he said.
   Arey lost touch with his beloved Red Sox and Celtics, but he
found love. He married Joyce Carrier, the Dukakis campaign's
national advance director.
   ``It was a complimentary relationship,'' he said of their
romance. ``Joyce had worked for Mondale in 1984 and knew about
presidential campaigns but not much about Dukakis. I knew everything
about the candidate, but not much about national politics.''
   He never lost his sense of humor. In the waning hours of the
campaign, he taunted a pet fish named Roger Ailes, after the
Republican media director. He sent NoDoz in an overnight letter to
the Bush-Quayle campaign. He played at loud volume a tape submitted
by a man who, in the dulcet tones of a Las Vegas lounge lizard, sang
over and over again, ``Vote for DU-KAAA-KIIISSS. Vote for
DU-KAAA-KIIISSS.''
   Akey gave optimistic interviews to visiting reporters. He
answered a question from a college student newspaper about how much
pizza the campaign workers consumed. He wrote summaries of the
network news programs and watched other staffers coordinate Dukakis'
final blitz of satellite interviews with local television stations
across the country.
   He wrote ``talking points,'' memos giving state campaign workers
the optimistic line from national headquarters to relay to local
media. One read, ``Dukakis is on the verge of a historic upset.''
   When it was all over, Akey sat with his feet on his desk, talking
calmly on the phone to friends and colleagues around the country,
writing down numbers as the TV sets droned on.
   ``Catch the wave,'' he'd say, and younger workers would take up
the chant.
   ``Surge,'' they'd yell, and slap hands.
   The surge never came. The numbers didn't hold. Akey skipped a
campaign celebration at Boston's World Trade Center because Joyce
was sick in their Charlestown apartment with a 100-degree fever.
   Akey took her some juice, a People magazine and a vase of roses
from the dozens of flowers that filled campaign headquarters on the
last day. Together they watched the campaign's death throes on
television.
   ``It's a special thing to have a job you're excited about, even
when you get three hours sleep and drag yourself out of a motel in
Iowa, not because you have to, but because you want to,'' Akey said.

   Michael Dukakis said today ``I gave it my best
shot'' in a losing run for the White House and said Republican
``distortions'' were a key ingredient in George Bush's victory.
   At a valedictory campaign news conference in Boston, Dukakis
congratulated the president-elect on a ``decisive victory'' but said
he doubted the nation's new leader could claim a mandate.
   Dukakis said the Democratic Party remains healthy nationally, but
sidestepped a question about whether he would once again seek the
presidency.
   He said he was now ready to return to his duties as governor of
Massachusetts. ``I will be digging into that vigorously and fully,''
he said.
   He repeated his charges that Republican ``media manipulators''
resorted to highly negative commercials to defeat him and said the
ads took their toll. He said he feared ``this would be a signal now
at the national level that this kind of campaigning is effective.''
   Asked whether he felt his record had defeated him, Dukakis
swiftly interrupted his questioner and said, ``The distortions of
that record contributed a great deal.''
   He said he was disappointed but not bitter at the defeat, but
said Republicans set a standard of negative campaigning that the
nation ``may live to regret.''
   It was a scene reminiscent of the day following Dukakis' loss in
the 1978 Democratic gubernatorial primary in Massachusetts.
   ``This campaign has not been just about Mike Dukakis and Lloyd
Bentsen. It's been about all of us and the values and ideals that we
share,'' the Democratic nominee said Tuesday night in a concession
speech shortly after polls closed on the West Coast.
   Flanked by his family, Dukakis acknowledged Bush's victory and
promised to work with the Republican president-elect.
   But in a forceful restatement of the populist themes that
animated his campaign in its closing weeks, he said his is an
unfinished agenda _ and he urged his followers to devote themselves
to it.
   ``We've got to fight for that young family in Levitown on Long
Island, New York, that wants to buy a home in the community in which
they grew up and can't afford it,'' Dukakis said. ``We've got to
fight for that family in Sioux City, Iowa, that can't afford health
insurance to pay the bills for its young son. We've got to fight for
those high school students in Los Angeles who are saying `no' to
drugs and `yes' to their future.
   ``We've got to open up that door of college opportunity to every
young person in this country who is qualified to do college work.
We've got to fight to end the shame of homelessness in this country
and this great and good nation ought to be able to do that,'' he
said.
   ``We're going to continue to fight with you and with the American
people so that every citizen in this country can be a full
shareholder in the American dream.''
   Dukakis, who had telephoned Bush just before the speech to
concede the race, offered a brief salute to his rival.
   ``I know I speak for all of you and all of the American people
when I say he will be our president and we will work with him,'' he
said. ``This nation faces major challenges and we must work
together.''
   After conceding, Dukakis met privately with members of his
campaign staff to thank them.
   With the campaign over, Dukakis goes back full time to what he
once called ``the greatest job in the world'' _ Massachusetts
governor. He planned to be in his statehouse office this morning
before holding a news conference.
   ``We'll be working with the new administration and above all I'll
be working with the people of Massachusetts,'' said Dukakis, who
during the campaign refused to say whether he would run for a fourth
term in 1990 if his presidential bid failed.
   He has been governor in absentia for much of the past year,
during which the state economy that brought him nationwide attention
faltered somewhat, causing sub-par state revenue collections that
forced Massachusetts to borrow to pay its bills. That undermined
Dukakis' campaign theme of competent economic management.
   During his concession speech, he did not acknowledge chants of
``92'' from his supporters, some of whom wept as he spoke. But the
governor said he plans to remain an active Democratic Party
spokesman.
   For Dukakis the end came after a furious finish to a campaign
criticized for lacking a central message and coordinated management.
   Dukakis campaigned non-stop the final three days, beginning
Saturday morning in Colorado and ending 81 hours and 8,500 air
travel miles later with a series of last-minute appeals through
satellite interviews with local television stations in several
states.
   Dukakis had kind words for the thousands of volunteers who worked
for his campaign and urged his young supporters to consider public
service as a vocation.
   ``There is nothing you can do in this world more fulfilling and
more satisfying than giving of yourself to others and making a
contribution to your community and your nation and your fellow
citizens,'' he said. ``I don't want you to be discouraged; I want
you to be encouraged by what you have done in this campaign. I want
you to go into public service. It is a noble profession.''
   And he revived the marathon metaphor he first used when he
announced his candidacy in March 1987, with a reference to the most
grueling portion of the annual Boston Marathon.
   ``We reached Heartbreak Hill and overcame it, and there we found
the strength to reach that finish line,'' Dukakis said. ``Tonight my
heart is filled with gratitude to everyone who has made this
extraordinary experience possible.''

   A flash flood swept through a

drowned, company officials said Wednesday.
   Tunnels about 2,000 feet underground were flooded Tuesday, and
there was no trace of the men 24 hours later, according to Gold
Fields of South Africa, the owner of the Kombat Mine.
   Company officials, in a statement released in Johannesburg, said
they were trying to stop the flooding from spreading to other
sections of the mine.
   The mine contains copper, lead and silver.
   The mine is near Tsumeb, in northern South-West Africa.
South-West Africa is ruled by South Africa and also is known as
Namibia.

   Suspending the Soviet military withdrawal from
Afghanistan is an attempt to ensure full compliance with the Geneva
agreement signed in April, a government spokesman said Wednesday.
   The Kremlin said Friday it was suspending the withdrawal, which
is to be finished by Feb. 15, and supplying Afghan government forces
with new, more powerful weapons because of continuing attacks by
Moslem guerrillas. MiG-27 ground-attack jets and SS-1 Scud missiles
have been seen in Afghanistan.
   ``We are doing everything possible to implement the Geneva
accords in all their elements,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim
Perfiliev said at a news briefing Wednesday.
   ``In connection with that, we have taken some steps to ensure the
implementation of the Geneva accords in full force, including the
withdrawal of the Soviet soldiers by Feb. 15. We surely hope that by
that date, Feb. 15, the pullout will be completed.''
   The Soviet Union and Afghanistan claim the supply of weapons to
the guerrillas by the United States and Pakistan is a violation of
the agreement signed April 14 by Afghanistan and Pakistan. The
United States and Soviet Union signed as guarantors.
   Alexander Bessmertnykh, first deputy foreign minister, said in
announcing the suspension that the Soviets would honor the agreement
as long as the other side did.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting fter a Communistr coup in April
1978 and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. An
estimated 115,000 were there when the withdrawal began and about
half have been pulled out.
   The insurgents were not involved in the Geneva negotiations, or
parties to the agreement, and have continued the civil war.

<HEAD>Study Finds 98 Percent Of Hospital Bills Contained Mistakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An audit of hospital bills nationwide has found
that 98 percent contained overcharges or charges for treatment not
delivered, says a financial information company that conducted the
study.
   The average bill examined was $39,000, and the average error was
$1,488, said Atlanta-based Equifax Inc. There were few instances of
undercharging or non-billing, the company said.
   The errors showed up in a year-long audit of thousands of bills
issued at more than 5,000 public, private and university hospitals,
said Patrick Swift, Equifax product manager in charge of auditing
services.
   He said one patient was handed a $150,000 bill last year that
contained an overcharge of about $39,000, which came about because
the hospital's pharmacy mislabeled the patient's medication.
   ``I think they put an extra zero on a price tag,'' he said in an
interview published in Wednesday's editions of The Atlanta
Constitution.
   Kee Carlisle, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Georgia, said, ``These kinds of errors drive the costs of health
care up and the costs of insurance up for what corporations and the
government have to pay.''
   American Hospital Association spokeswoman Jan Shulman said the
study did not represent the total picture of medical billing.
   ``We're not trying to say that accidents don't happen, that
mistakesin billing don't happen,'' she said. ``But I do believe that
hospitals make an effort to be accurate in their billing.''
   The Equifax audit was conducted from January to December 1987 by
registered nurses hired by Equifax. When errors were uncovered, the
individual insurance companies involved were contacted and the
errors corrected, Swift said.
   He said errors were most often found in intensive care or
longer-term treatment programs, or in hospital laboratories and
pharmacies where ``there is more activity required to track and bill
properly.''
   Swift said the results of the audit are preliminary and final
results will be released later this year.

   A gunman raided the United Arab Emirates
Embassy on Wednesday and took the ambassador and eight other people
hostage, but commandos stormed the building and freed the captives,
officials said.
   The gunman was arrested after the two-hour siege and no
casualties were reported after the six-man police unit stormed the
embassy building.
   Released captives said the gunmen had spoken by telephone with an
official at the office of Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the
United Arab Emirates president, and demanded the release of
political prisoners.
   The gunman threatened to blow up the embassy when the official
told him Zayed was unavailable, the captives said.
   Sudanese officials decided to storm the building after the threat
was made, officials said.
   Khartoum Commissioner Fatih Abdoun said the gunman was armed with
a revolver and explosives, the Middle East News Agency said.
   Ambassador Mohammed Sultan's driver, who was initially held with
the other hostages, told The Associated Press that the gunman freed
him when ``I claimed I was not a member of the embassy staff.''
   Besides Sultan, the other hostages were the embassy's deputy
chief of mission, the consul, the secretary, the gardener and three
women whose occupations were not known. The names of all the
hostages were not immediately available.
   The driver said the attacker was armed with a revolver and
carried in the other hand ``something that looked like a TNT stick.''
   He said the gunman held his captives in a second-floor room and
they were ``really scared to death.''
   ``The ambassador and the others were made to sit on the carpeted
floor,'' he said. ``The embassy secretary had tears in his eyes and
sweat on his face.''
   The driver described the gunman as ``a dark-skinned young man,
tall, and with one leg that looked shorter than the other.''
   He said the attacker insisted on speaking to Zayed by telephone
and warned that he would not free his captives ``unless four of my
colleagues held in Abu Dhabi are released.''
   Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency earlier reported that
the gunman was a United Arab Emirates national and that he had
applied to the embassy a week ago for entry visas for a number of
Sudanese who wanted to work in the country.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Bob Miller won his seat in 1986
despite allegations of conflict of interest. Now he will become
governor without a campaign _ but after more allegations.
   Miller, 43, will assume the seat vacated by Democratic Gov. Dick
Bryan, who was elected to the U.S. Senate.
   Bryan's opponent, GOP Sen. Chic Hecht, charged that Miller had
mob connections. Hecht declined to be specific.
   Miller's father was an associate of former casino executive Carl
Thomas, convicted in a Las Vegas hotel-casino profit skimming case.
But Miller said he was shocked at revelations of Thomas' criminal
activity.
   In Miller's 1986 race for lieutenant governor, his opponent,
Republican Joe Brown, raised claims of conflict of interest in cases
handled by Miller as a district attorney.
   The 6-foot-6 Miller was born in Chicago and raised in Las Vegas.
After getting a law degree from Loyola of Los Angeles School of Law,
he returned to Las Vegas where he served two terms as Clark County
district attorney.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Attorney Says Lewis `Lives Humbly'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS MEMPHIS-dated item to UPDATE with quotes from attorney</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainer Jerry Lee Lewis, who has filed
a personal bankruptcy petition after a long battle with the Internal
Revenue Service, has few assets and lives humbly, his attorney said
Wednesday.
   In filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy Tuesday, the rock singer and
piano player listed more than $3 million in debts _ including $2
million owed to the IRS.
   ``He's had a long road with the IRS,'' bankruptcy attorney Norman
Hagemeyer said. ``It's amazing, but he doesn't really have anything
of value. He lives humbly.
   ``A trustee will be appointed, but he may find no assets because
of Mr. Lewis' long involvement with the IRS.''
   The performer's outstanding taxes date to 1975, Hagemeyer said.
   Lewis, 53, whose turbulent life is the subject of a motion
picture being filmed in Memphis, listed 22 creditors in the petition.
   Another major creditor listed was George Cunningham and the
Whiskey River Club in Spencer, Okla. In 1978, Cunningham won a
judgment of $453,000 after suing Lewis for failing to show up for a
concert. At 10 percent interest since then, the debt totals about
$950,000, Hagemeyer said.
   The bankruptcy attorney described the Chapter 7 proceeding as a
straight liquidation, or ``take everything I have, minus some
exemptions.''
   He said Lewis might be able to have outstanding taxes for the
past three years forgiven. He did not know how much money that would
be.
   The motion picture ``Great Balls of Fire,'' with actor Dennis
Quaid playing Lewis, deals with 18 months of the entertainer's life
in the late 1950s.
   In 1984, Lewis was found innocent of evading taxes, but the
verdict didn't lessen his tax liability. The next year, IRS agents
seized property from Lewis' ranch near Nesbit, Miss.
   Lewis is best known for his 1950s hits ``A Whole Lotta Shakin'
Going On'' and ``Great Balls of Fire.''

   A judge on Wednesday sentenced Kenneth O'Dowd, the
uncle of pop star Boy George, to six years in prison for rape.
   Prosecutors said O'Dowd punched and raped a 22-year-old the woman
at her London apartment last Christmas Eve after locking her
3-year-old son in a bedroom.
   O'Dowd, 41, changed his name from Vissard after his nephew, whose
real name is George O'Dowd, rose to fame as the androgynous lead
singer with the group Culture Club.
   Kenneth O'Dowd, who had 44 previous offenses, including bigamy,
pleaded innocent.
   He gained notoriety in 1984 by alleging that former Conservative
Prime Minister Edward Heath had appeared in a pornographic
photograph with a woman and a child. Heath denied the allegation and
successfully defended his name in court.
   O'Dowd was jailed in 1985 for two years for perverting the course
of justice by faking the photograph, which turned out to be a
photocopy of a collection of unrelated pictures stuck together.

<HEAD>Blacks, Women Take Baby Steps Toward Goal Of Parity In Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks and women eeked out slim gains in this
year's House races and held even in the Senate, but some supporters
complained Wednesday that it would take centuries at that pace to
achieve political parity.
   With blacks making up about 11 percent of the U.S. population and
women accounting for more than half, just 5 percent of the 435
members of the new House will be black and about the same share will
be women.
   The figures are even more lopsided in the 100-member Senate,
which will remain all white for another two years and continue to
include just two women.
   Blacks and women were at their high water marks of 22 and 23
members, respectively, in the expiring Congress. There will be one
more black congressman in the new House and at least one, possibly
two, more women.
   Feminist leader Eleanor Smeal said America is ``locking out women
and blacks'' with a political system weighted toward those already
in office.
   ``We've got to do something about the rules,'' she said. ``These
are incumbent protection clubs the way the rules are working.''
   Jane Danowitz, executive director of the bipartisan Women's
Campaign Fund, said that despite incremental gains for female
candidates, ``it's still not enough.''
   ``At the rate we're going, it's going to be 500 years until we
achieve parity,'' she said. ``I don't think anybody wants to wait
that long.''
   The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Mervyn
Dymally, was equally pessimistic, saying the Reagan years and George
Bush's campaign had left the nation divided along race and class
lines.
   ``It's bad enough to lose, but when you lose on the basis of race
and polarization, it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth,'' said
Dymally, D-Calif.
   Others found cause for optimism.
   ``When you think of how we have just been trying to hold our
numbers, you can call 1988 a boom year even though there were only
two women (challengers) who won,'' said Irene Natividad, who chairs
the National Women's Political Caucus.
   The net gain for women came in Washington state, where state Rep.
Jolene Unsoeld narrowly defeated Republican Bill Wight. In New York,
Democrat Nita Lowey claimed victory over two-term Republican Joseph
DioGuardi, although the congressman refused to concede with several
thousand absentee ballots yet to be counted.
   Blacks picked up their first House seat in New Jersey, where
Newark Councilman Donald Payne will replace retiring Democrat Peter
Rodino.
   Rodino, a 40-year House veteran known for his strong civil rights
record, had been pressed to make way for a black successor in the
majority black district. Jesse Jackson two years ago called Rodino a
``good man,'' but said: ``We can have a good man and black man from
New Jersey at the same time.''
   ``I believe this will make all of the people feel ... part of
this great nation,'' Payne said following his victory over
Republican Michael Webb, who also is black. ``The House of
Representatives should be truly representative.''
   In Senate races, Susan Engeleiter, Republican leader of the
Wisconsin state Senate, was the more promising of two women
challengers, but she was unable to catch up to Democrat Herbert
Kohl, a millionaire businessman. Republican Maria Hustace was no
challenge to Democratic Sen. Spark Matsunaga in Hawaii.
   The two incumbent women in the Senate _ Nancy L. Kassebaum,
R-Kan., and Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. _ were not up for re-election.
   Two black Republicans ran for Senate seats in Virginia and
Maryland but lost by wide margins to popular Democrats. Maurice
Dawkins, a lobbyist and retired minister, lost to former Gov.
Charles S. Robb in Virginia and former Assistant Secretary of State
Alan L. Keyes was defeated by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.
   Linda Williams, a political analyst at the Joint Center for
Political Studies, which focuses on black political affairs, said
both men were ``token candidates'' placed in no-win races.
   She said the blacks probably won't win a Senate seat until a
moderate black House member who can attract white voters decides to
run. Future gains in the House also will be hard to come by, since
most black-dominated districts now have black congressmen, she said.
   ``It's going to be slow as a tortoise for a good while to come,''
Ms. Williams said. ``It really comes down to (blacks) winning a lot
of white votes.''
   The last black to serve in the Senate was Edward Brooke, a
Massachusetts Republican who was defeated for re-election in 1978.

   County Commissioner Conrad Burns may not
know it yet, but his defeat of two-term U.S. Sen. John Melcher put
him in Montana's history books.
   Burns' win Tuesday made him only the second man to defeat an
incumbent U.S. senator in Montana. It also made him the first
Republican senator from Montana in 36 years.
   Burns, a farm-and-ranch broadcaster and a county commissioner in
Billings who was making his second try for elective office, defeated
Melcher 52 percent to 48 percent.
   Republican Stan Stephens won the Montana gubernatorial race,
defeating former Democratic Gov. Thomas Judge by 189,630 votes to
168,537 votes, a margin of 53 percent to 47 percent. Stephens will
be the first Republican governor in 20 years.
   George Bush captured Montana's four electoral votes, defeating
Michael Dukakis 53 percent to 47 percent. Bush had 189,598 votes to
168,120 cast for Dukakis.
   Melcher had been targeted for defeat by the Republican National
Senatorial Committee, which helped recruit Burns and funneled almost
$400,000 into his campaign.
   ``I was hoping to campaign for a month solid,'' Melcher said.
``I've only been out here just about 17 or 18 days. I never really
had a good feel for the race.''
   Stephens, a former radio broadcaster and cable television company
owner from Havre, said his victory reflected Montana's desire ``to
put someone with business experience in the executive position of
the state.''
   Both Montana U.S. House seats went to the incumbents, Democrat
Pat Williams and Republican Ron Marlenee.
   Montana voters refused to repeal the state's mandatory seat-belt
law; approved repeal of the constitutional right of the needy to
welfare benefits; and defeated a mandatory deposit on beverage
containers.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Forces Thousands of Refugees to Dangerous Border Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Cambodian refugees have
been removed from a U.N.-aided camp by Khmer Rouge guerrillas and
forced into a heavily mined, malarial jungle, Western relief
officials said Wednesday.
   Since June, the officials said, the communist guerrillas have
moved all but 1,000 of 9,500 refugees from the camp of Ta Luan in
Thailand's eastern Trat province to a new camp on the Cambodian
frontier several miles away.
   Several thousand other refugees were moved to the border from the
O'Trao-Natrao camp in northeast Surin province.
   With aid officials watching, guerrillas transferred everything
from Ta Luan in Chinese-supplied trucks _ entire houses, even papaya
trees. They left behind a ghost village of ``the crippled, the
blind, the amputees,'' said one Western official, who like other
sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Aug. 27, aid officials declared a medical emergency at Ta Luan
upon finding, one source said, ``160 patients, 45 of them seriously
ill, and a 15-year-old medic in charge.'' The Khmer Rouge has barred
relief officials from the new site, saying it is ``too dangerous.''
   However, one official said a Thai military officer who visited it
a few days ago ``was shocked. Conditions were desperate. They had no
medical facilities and it was in a very malarious area.''
   According to refugees who managed to flee, the area is mined
toward the Thai border to prevent escape. In recent days some
refugees have been allowed back to Ta Luan's medical clinic. Most
have malaria.
   Aid officials say the movement of the refugees is aimed at
strengthening the Khmer Rouge's position as the world community
tries to isolate it.
   The Khmer Rouge, with 40,000 Chinese-armed troops, is the
strongest of three guerrilla groups fighting Vietnamese forces that
invaded Cambodia in late 1978. The invasion ended a three-year Khmer
Rouge dictatorship that killed hundreds of thousands of people in
slave labor camps and torture chambers.
   After fleeing to Thailand, the Khmer Rouge set up camps where
reportedly they hold refugees from the war as virtual prisoners.
   Aid officials have reported nighttime executions of refugees and
forced porter duty on battlefields.
   ``We are regularly in receipt of firsthand reports of bizarre
violations of human rights'' in these camps, Y.Y. Kim, recently
retired director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation, told aid
donors in June.

<HEAD>Winning in Florida, Colorado and Arizona, U.S. English Looks to
Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official English message that
Florida, Colorado and Arizona voters wrote on Election Day will be
carried to Congress, the head of U.S. English promised Wednesday.
   ``There's no question that the victories of Florida and Colorado
_ and even the one in Arizona _ were just stunning,'' Stanley
Diamond, the acting chairman of U.S. English, said. ``They're just
smashing victories for us.''
   Voters in Florida, the country's fourth-largest state, approved
Amendment 11 by an 84-16 percent margin. The amendment changes the
state constitution to make English the state's official language and
authorizes the Legislature to write laws enforcing that status.
   The victory was decried by Arthur J. Kropp, president of People
for the American Way, a Washington-based lobby describing itself as
a``constitutional liberties organization.''
   ``Amendment 11's victory will help the English-only movement
achieve its hidden agenda: rights for some citizens, not all,''
Kropp said. ``Sadly, the citizens of Florida may now have to share
the bitter experience of California ... and other areas where
English-only laws have fostered bigotry and intolerance for those
whose first language is not English.''
   Diamond and other backers deny that the movement is based on
bigotry.
   Coloradans endorsed a similar measure by a wide margin, but the
vote was closer in Arizona, where the official English amendment was
approved 51-49 percent.
   Arizona's Proposition 106 requires state and county governments
to conduct all business in English, with certain exceptions in
education, public health and safety, the justice system and federal
election law.
   ``The victory is truly the expression of the people,'' Diamond
said in a telephone interview from his Washington office.
   Seventeen states have now passed laws or amendments designating
English their official language.
   ``We want that message _ and particulary the vote _ to get to the
Congress,'' Diamond said. A proposed amendment to the U.S.
Constitution has been sitting before a House subcommittee for more
than a year, he said.
   Diamond said the official English campaign would likely turn its
attention next to Texas, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
   The campaign had been marked by lawsuits and the resignations of
key proponents, including former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, who
said he believed the Arizona proposal could hurt minorities.
   On Oct. 17, former Reagan White House aide Linda Chavez resigned
as president of U.S. English, citing a report that at least one
major contributor to the group has advocated forced sterilization.
U.S. English co-founder John Tanton resigned the same day.
   The U.S. Justice Department had joined unsuccessful efforts to
remove the measure from Florida's ballot. Opponents had complained
that petitions weren't circulated in Spanish in six of Florida's 67
counties.

<HEAD>Four States OK Lotteries; Gambling Approved for Deadwood, S.D.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky, Indiana, Idaho and Minnesota voted to establish state
lotteries, while South Dakota endorsed legalized gambling in
Deadwood, the Black Hills town where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned
down playing poker 112 years ago.
   Voters in South Dakota approved by nearly a two-thirds margin
Tuesday a constitutional amendment giving the Legislature authority
to set regulations for gambling. Deadwood voters ultimately will
have to approve the idea by 60 percent.
   The plan would permit slot machines and card games, with proceeds
going toward historic preservation in the town.
   In Kentucky, voters approved by 61-39 percent an amendment
allowing a lottery.
   The vote was a ``victory for Kentucky's children, senior citizens
and Vietnam veterans,'' Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said. He asked the
General Assembly to enact lottery legislation during a special
session beginning Nov. 28.
   In Indiana, voters approved by a 5-3 margin a proposition to
remove the state constitution's ban on lotteries and other forms of
gambling.
   ``The legislators still have to approve a lottery,'' said Paul R.
Oakes, chairman of an anti-gambling group. Legislators in January
begin deciding how a lottery will be run and how its projected $150
million in annual revenue will be spent.
   In Idaho, pro-lottery forces overcame a media blitz by opponents
and narrowly won support for a constitutional amendment authorizing
a lottery.
   In Minnesota, a state lottery measure was approved 59 percent to
41 percent.
   Since approval of a constitutional amendment requires a majority
of all voters casting ballots, a 60 percent majority is generally
considered the minimum needed to ensure passage because many voters
skip the constitutional questions.
   The Minnesota Legislature now must decide whether a lottery will
actually be established.

<HEAD>Mother Sets Self on Fire to Protest Prison Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of a leftist serving a life
sentence set herself on fire Wednesday to protest conditions in
Turkish prisons, but friends put out the flames, a news agency
reported.
   Hanim Sonmez suffered second-degree burns when she doused herself
with gasoline and struck a match, the Anatolia news agency said.
   The flames were put out by friends who accompanied her to a
meeting of the Association of Relatives of Inmates and Convicts.
   ``Our children have suffered enough, now it is mothers' turn to
die,'' Mrs. Sonmez was quoted by Anatolia as chanting during the
meeting.
   A witness told The Associated Press that Sonmez is the mother of
Erdogan Sonmez, an inmate at the Eskisehir prison in central Turkey.
He was convicted of terrorist activities as a member of the outlawed
Kurdish Labor Party, said the witness, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The group seeks to set up a Marxist state in parts of eastern and
southeastern Turkey and has been waging a war with Turkish security
forces since 1984.
   The witness said the woman's son was one of about 300 inmates who
started a hunger strike 22 days ago for better conditions.
   Hundreds of other inmates have been fasting with the same
objectives in five other prisons throughout the country, newspapers
have reported.

<HEAD>Estonians Get Cool Reception From Soviet Lawmakers, Tass Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Estonians who oppose some of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposed political reforms got a chilly
reception from lawmakers Wednesday who heard them out but didn't
support them, Tass said.
   Grassroots organizations in Estonia and the neighboring Baltic
republics of Latvia and Lithuania have condemned the blueprint for
political change advanced by Gorbachev, saying it removes their
constitutional right to secede from the Soviet Union and shifts
control of the economy from local authorities to Moscow.
   The changes advanced by Gorbachev also create a new national
legislature and a powerful new presidency. The political reforms are
to be voted on by the Supreme Soviet parliament at a special session
scheduled Nov. 29.
   Representatives of the Estonian People's Front were invited to a
Wednesday session of a Supreme Soviet commission that considered
citizens' remarks and proposals about the political changes.
   ``Commission deputies attentively listened to their arguments but
did not support them,'' Tass said, in a brief report on the meeting.
   The official news agency said the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet
has received more than 70,000 letters about the proposed amendments
to the Constitution and changes in electoral law that are the
backbone of Gorbachev's political reform plan.
   Tass said an ``absolute majority'' of the letters voice support
for the changes. One percent of the letters contain any objections,
the parliamentary commission was said to have noted during
Wednesday's meeting.
   Tass said the commission would hold another session soon.

   An Israeli patrol opened fire at stone-throwing
Palestinians in Gaza City on Wednesday, killing a 3-year-old boy and
wounding two youths, Arab reports said.
   The clash came as Palestinians marked the start of the 12th month
of their uprising against Israeli occupation, blocking roads with
burning tires, unfurling illegal Palestinian flags and shutting
businesses with a general strike.
   At least 11 other Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes
in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   In Gaza City's Shajaiya quarter, an army jeep was pelted with
stones and troops responded with gunfire, an Arab reporter said.
Osama Mohammed Abu Ganima was killed when a bullet hit him in the
chest, officials at Shifa Hospital said.
   Family members said the child was playing nearby when the
shooting occurred. In the same incident, a 12-year-old Arab was shot
in the jaw and a 13-year-old was wounded in the leg, hospital
officials said.
   An army spokesman in Gaza confirmed the child's death. ``We are
questioning troops to see if the death resulted from army
shooting,'' he said on condition of anonymity.
   In the city's Mograbi Quarter, soldiers who were being stoned
responded with a favorite weapon of Arab youths, the slingshot,
before opening fire with guns, an Arab witness said.
   A 17-year-old Palestinian was wounded in the hip with a plastic
bullet in that incident, said an official at Ahli Arab hospital. The
hospital officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Elsewhere in the Gaza Strip, seven youths aged 15 to 18 were shot
and wounded. The army confirmed three wounded in Gaza.
   Three teen-agers were reported wounded in the West Bank, hospital
officials said.
   Jewish settlers in the occupied lands, meanwhile, demanded
tougher action against Palestinian rioters after a 52-year-old woman
settler was injured in the head by a stone.
   Margaret Rosner was struck Tuesday while traveling in a car that
had come form the West Bank and was just inside Israel, Israeli news
reports said. She was hospitalized in serious condition.
   The national Itim news agency said police arrested a 25-year-old
Palestinian from the West bank town of Qalqilya as a suspect.
   Public transportation was halted and shops closed in the latest
strike against the Israeli occupation of the territories captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   The strike marked the start of the 12th month of uprising that
began Dec. 8. Wednesday's death raised to 310 the Arab death toll in
the rebellion. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem, activists sprayed walls with
graffiti praising the PLO's plans to declare Palestinian
independence at a meeting of the Palestine National Council
beginning Saturday.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 10-member inner Cabinet also
debated the upcoming meeting, including ways of responding to an
expected increase in Palestinian violence, Israel radio reported.
   ``The PNC decisions and declaration of independence would have no
effect here,'' it quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin as saying.
``All attempts to exploit these decisions and violate order will be
crushed by force.''
   Israeli army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said additional
forces were being deployed in the occupied lands during the meeting.

   The 1988 corn crop is expected to total 4.67
billion bushels, up 3 percent from the forecast a month ago but down
34 percent from the 1987 harvest, the Agriculture Department said
today.
   According to the department's Agricultural and Statistics Board,
an estimated 83 percent of this fall's corn acreage was harvested as
of Nov. 1, 7 percent behind last year but 16 percent ahead of the
1983-87 average.
   Farmers cut back to a little over 56.7 million acres for corn
harvest from 59.1 million a year ago.
   The corn harvest, drastically reduced by the summer drought, was
the smallest since 1983, when similar searing heat and a shortage of
rain hammered the nation's farmlands and reduced output to 4.17
billion bushels.
   The record year was 1985 when farmers produced 8.88 billion
bushels of corn.
   The cotton harvest, based on Nov. 1 indications, was estimated at
14.8 million bales, 1 percent above both the 1987 crop and the Oct.
1 forecast. The record was 18.95 million bales in 1937.
   With the harvest of 1988 crops winding down, no new production
figures were included for many earlier commodities such as wheat,
oats and barley.

<HEAD>Policy Against Male Children Barred</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of a housing complex have agreed to
abolish a policy under which residents were evicted if they had male
children.
   Brothers Don and Richard Allen, owners of Kings Cove Condominiums
in Moore, agreed to a consent order presented Tuesday to U.S.
District Judge Wayne Alley, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Smith.
   The order was presented in court with a complaint alleging the
Allens discriminated against families with male children in
violation of housing and civil rights laws.
   Smith said the owners stated in an affidavit that at one time the
housing complex had a set of preferences governing acceptance of
tenants. Families with no children were most desirable, followed by
couples with children under age 3, then families with female
children.
   Don Allen denied discriminating against tenants.
   ``We have to evict more boys than girls because they are more
problems than girls,'' he said. ``You have just a higher percentage
of problems with boys than girls.''
   The complaint came from Luther Blythe, who said the owners ``just
decided they didn't like us one day and they evicted us.'' He lived
at Kings Cove with his wife, daughter and his daughter's two sons
until they were evicted.
   Smith said Blythe would be able to move back into the condos if
there were a vacancy.
   Kings Cove has five individually owned units and 141 rental
units. The Allens said it has no vacancies.

   Here is the text of the news conference held
Wednesday by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis following his defeat
in the 1988 presidential race.
   Thank you very much. Thank you.
   Let me begin by saying thank you to the members of the press and
especially those of you who travelled with us. I know it wasn't easy
_ particularly the last three days. I apologize for that. You all
look a little better than you did yesterday, and I hope it's because
you got yourselves a good night sleep.
   But it was a pleasure working with you. You're all professionals.
I wish I could have spent a little more time with you. Maybe there
will be time for that later on.
   But I'm just very grateful to all of you, and it was a pleasure
to get to know you and meet you and to admire the way you covered
this campaign, covered me and the professionalism with which you did
that.
   Let me just briefly summarize some of the things I said
yesterday, and then I'll be open to questions.
   Once again, let me congratulate the vice president on a very
decisive victory. At the same time, the Democratic party is clearly
alive and well and very strong. We've added to our majority in the
Congress, we've added to our majority in the Senate, and added to
our majority of governors.
   And what I think this says is that the American people want
leadership in Washington that will respond to the concerns of
average American families, that will fight battles which are
important to fight _ for good jobs and decent housing and quality
education and drug-free schools, a clean and safe environment, and
health care for the American people. All of the things that I tried
very hard to emphasize in the campaign. The kind of agenda, which I
believe most Americans want their government to respond to, want the
president and the Congress to respond to.
   And I personally will continue to do whatever I can with my
fellow governors, with the Congress, with the new administration,
here in Massachusetts, to make sure that we respond and respond
strongly and well to those concerns and those challenges which face
the American people everyday, face the people of my state everyday,
and for which those of us who are elected to public office are
elected to do something about.
   I spent the morning in my State House office getting reacclimated
and going back to work on my job as governor of the commonwealth,
and obviously I'll be digging into that vigorously and fully over
the course of the next few days.
   I think Kitty and I will probably take the weekend off and maybe
sometime down the road, in several weeks, take a little more time
out.
   But it's good to be home and good to be back in this community,
in this commonwealth, which has been so good to us and responded so
strongly yesterday.
   And I'm just very grateful to the people of Massachusetts for
their giving me the opportunity to be their governor, to be the
Democratic nominee, and to share the kinds of goals and values and
ideals that the state and this country stand for.
   And again, my thanks to all of you for what you've done, and let
me again express my pleasure to you for the chance I've had to get
to know you.

<DATELINE>ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of
President-elect George Bush's remarks Wednesday on his arrival at
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
   Thank you all so very much. Thank you so very much. What a
wonderful _ please, be seated. What a wonderful ``Welcome Back to
Washington.'' There's so much I want to say, but I'll keep it
relatively brief.
   We're so moved that all of you would come out today, and I expect
we've kept you waiting. But I have some thoughts I want to share
about what's happened in the past 24 hours. And earlier today we
went to a church service in Houston at the church that Barbara and I
have belonged to since _ in the early '60s, I believe 1962. And some
of my children were confirmed there _ our children. And Barbara
taught _ and Barbara taught Sunday School there. And I was a member
of the vestry and we read from the Psalms today, gave thanks, sang
some of the old songs. And the Pastor prayed for a world of
righteousness and kindness, of liberty and peace. And I guess that
is probably the first moment when I realized the enormity of it all.
   And we forget that the whole world is watching. And how could it
not have been impressed by the peaceful beginning of what will be a
transfer of power as the world's oldest, greatest democracy quietly
moves on and shifts and moves on again.
   And many, many leaders of the Western Alliance have very
generously been communicating their good will and congratulations.
And I assured them that I will do my level best to see that the
United States does its part in keeping the alliance strong. And to
our friends and allies in the world, the good policies of the last
eight years will continue. The closeness and the consultations will
continue. And, after eight years of strong leadership, calm
stability, dramatic progress, we are open now to new progress and to
new challenges. And to those who do not yet view themselves as our
allies, well, we'll keep on trying. But do not indulge in any hopes
that our resolve will be weakened.
   We're going to continue to stay strong because we truly love
peace and we're willing to pay the price for it. You know, just
before landing here at Andrews, I received a very thoughtful
communication from General Secretary Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
And I conveyed to his ambassador my determination to keep this new
important bilateral relationship moving forward. Governor Dukakis in
his gracious remarks last night offered to work with us to build a
better America. And we forget _ but that's really what it's all
about. And let me tell you what I intend to do to build a better
America.
   Our country these days has a hunger for harmony, and I felt it at
so many moments. I felt it strongly during the campaign, and so I'm
going to do everything I can to have good and open and friendly
relationships with the United States Congress. And I don't want us
to talk at each other. I want us to talk to each other. And I've
said during _ and I've said that I want a kinder and a gentler
nation. And I think there's a hunger for that, too, in our country.
There's so much to do to help make life better for all.
   And I want to say a few words about Dan Quayle. And, yes, he has
had a baptism by fire. But steel is tougher, harder, when it's been
tempered by the flame. And we both know that we've got a lot of work
to do. Sudden national fame can be tough; it can be tough on your
family. We all know that, all of us. But let me tell you about him.
He's going to be one of the great vice presidents. You watch him
closely, America, because you're going to respect what you see.
   And now we're going down to see the president in the White House,
have a chance to discuss the future of the country. And any man is
lucky to work with a good friend, but I must be the luckiest man in
the world to have as my close friend one of the great heroes of the
modern era _ Ronald Wilson Reagan. He is _ he is the living
embodiment of the word ``patriot.'' No man ever loved his country
more or served her better. The president, and his great first lady
will be a tough act to follow.
   I know it's autumn, getting on to late fall, but I have a sense
of blooming, a kind of sense of spring, and all these new
beginnings, and a wonderful new era rich with possibilities and full
of hope. It's good news, and I'm very, very happy. Barbara and I are
happy and blessed to be with you here today. Thank you, and God
bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

<HEAD>Californians Slash Insurance Rates, Back Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a vote heard all the way to Wall Street,
Californians approved a Ralph Nader-sponsored measure to slash auto
and other liability insurance rates.
   They also narrowly gave George Bush their 47 electoral votes,
returned Republican Pete Wilson to the U.S. Senate and decisively
rejected the most expensive initiative campaign the nation has ever
seen.
   The rejected initiative was a no-fault auto insurance proposal,
which lost despite a multimillion-dollar effort by the insurance
industry.
   Voters approved the insurance-rate measure, which was sponsored
by Ralph Nader and other consumer advocates, by 51.1 percent to 48.9
percent.
   The measure immediately cuts all auto and other liability
insurance rates to 80 percent of their November 1987 levels and
freezes them for two years. It also mandates additional rate cuts
for motorists with clean driving records.
   Major insurers immediately filed two suits challenging the
measure and announced they will stop writing new auto insurance
policies in California because of it.
   Wall Street analysts attributed Wednesday declines in some
insurance stocks to the California vote.
   Voters also approved a 25-cent-a-pack increase in the state
cigarette tax and a limited AIDS reporting initiative sponsored by
law enforcement groups.
   But they rejected, by a 2-1 margin, a much broader and more
controversial AIDS reporting measure. It would have required doctors
to report all positive AIDS tests to public health officials, and
public health officials to try to track down all known sexual
partners of persons who tested positive.
   Bush took 51 percent of the presidential vote, while Wilson
defeated Democrat Leo McCarthy with 52.6 percent of the Senate vote.
   California's 45 congressional races produced no change in the
current 27-18 Democratic majority in the state's House delegation,
as every congressional incumbent on the ballot was re-elected.
However, the delegation will have three new faces _ all Republicans
_ replacing two Republicans who retired and one who was defeated in
the June primary.

   There's lots to do and many challenges out there ahead, and what
happens in the future remains to be seen.
   Q. Governor --
   Q. -- Would you consider it though?
   Q. Governor, some people believe that the state of peace and
prosperity and the continuity of Reaganism was so strong that any
Democratic nominee would have found it almost impossible to win this
year. But, I suppose this morning a lot more people believe that
this race was winnable and that, in fact, you blew it. Now, what is
your view? Do you think _ do you think it was practically winnable,
and if so, could you precisely tell us --
   A. -- I think it was neither of the above.
   Q. All right. Where do you think you went wrong?
   A. Well, they'll be plenty of time for analysis, Sam. At this
point, I just -- (inaudible) -- activity of being Governor of my
state again. But, if you look at the results, I think clearly had
things gone differently, maybe a different combination of factors,
it was winnable.
   I think I lost states representing about 133 electoral votes by
four percentage points or less. Had we won those states, we'd have
had 250 electoral votes and we'd have been very close to a winning
majority.
   But every campaign has its own dynamics, its own ebbs and flows,
its high points and its low points, and it's obviously, at least for
me, too early to try to go into a detailed analysis.
   I gave it my best shot, and we had our good days and our
not-so-good days. The last two or three weeks, I hope, gave people a
good sense of who Mike Dukakis is and what he believes in, the kind
of leadership that he's tried to provide in the course of his
political career and wanted to provide as president of the United
States. And I'm going to go on now to work with my fellow governors
and other elected officials to do everything I can to make good on
those ideals and those values. Yeah?
   Q. Governor, did you wait too long to answer the negative attacks
against you? And a second part to that question, does your defeat
mean that future campaigns are going to use negative ads more?
   A. Oh, I don't think there's any question that the negativism we
had in this campaign is something that had an impact on me, and I
hope it doesn't happen, but I fear that this will be a signal now at
the national level that this kind of campaigning is effective
campaigning. I certainly hope not.
   Whether or not I waited too long is something which I'm not sure
I'm really the person to judge. As many of you have heard me say,
I'm basically a positive person who has tried all of his political
career to provide positive leadership. I think you're elected to
political office to do positive things and to make a real difference
in the lives of real people.
   And it was important, particularly to somebody who had not been
on the national scene, that I give people a sense of what my agenda
was, what I wanted to do, what my priorities were. And I tried very
hard, as you recall, to lay those out in great detail. And I think
we did that.

<HEAD>Networks' Election Projections Raise West Coast Furor</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's election coverage featured cartoons of a
blue elephant and a pink donkey, but it was ABC's and CBS' early
projections that most repulsed West Coast voters.
   With polls still open in 11 states, first CBS and then ABC
announced Tuesday night that Vice President George Bush didn't need
to change his zip code.
   The reaction to this quick announcement was sharply critical.
   ``I think any person with any amount of common sense would find
this practice revolting,'' said voter Rip Rense after hearing
network projections 90 minutes before his Los Angeles poll closed.
``I think it is a case of TV journalists being irresponsible because
of ratings.''
   Based on its exit-poll surveys, CBS called the presidential race
at 9:17 p.m. EST, with ABC following three minutes later. NBC didn't
announce its projection until 10:30 p.m. Cable News Network called
it at 10:42, based on counted votes.
   Polls in the far West didn't close until 11 p.m. EST and in
Alaska, until midnight.
   ``One of our neighbors is not coming to vote tonight for the
simple matter that she saw the results on TV and said her vote
wouldn't count,'' said Howard Friedland of the Los Angeles suburb of
Sherman Oaks.
   Even election analysts on ABC-owned station KABC-TV went on
camera to express outrage over their network's behavior.
   ``I understand it when the networks want to report the news. But
this isn't the news,'' said conservative commentator Bruce
Herschensohn. ``They're making the news ... and then reporting the
news that they made. I think it's terribly unfair to the Western
states.''
   KABC colleague John Tunney, a former U.S. Senator, said he was
furious over the ABC and CBS projections. ``Once again, we see the
East Coast networks treating us out here in the West as though we
don't count. We count a lot.''
   Two of the three networks admitted that their much-vaunted exit
polls had produced faulty projections. ABC wrongly gave Maryland to
Gov. Michael Dukakis and CBS erroneously awarded Illinois to
Dukakis. CBS anchorman Dan Rather apologized for the significant
error Wednesday morning.
   ``We're in the news business,'' said Robert Siegenthaler, vice
president of news practices at ABC. ``When we have knowledge that we
have confidence in ... we are supposed to tell people that... We had
an error. We're assessing the factors now that caused us to make
it.''
   Siegenthaler also disputed the allegation that early predictions
reduce voter turnout in Western states.
   NBC's Tom Brokaw, aware that the competition had already called
the presidential race, reported with caution Tuesday night. ``Well,
George Bush is on the front porch now,'' Brokaw said almost an hour
after CBS had declared Bush the victor. ``But he's not through the
front door of the White House.''
   ``We didn't want to make a bad call,'' said Michael Gartner, the
new president of NBC News. ``Being first with news is competitive.
But was it news that Bush was going to win the presidency? We could
have told you that at 5 p.m.
   ``I don't mind the fact that I was third last night at all,''
Gartner said. ``We have policies and we live by them. We don't go
until we're sure.''
   Network projections based on exit polling _ interviews with
voters who have already cast ballots _ have been a controversy since
1980, when NBC called the race for Ronald Reagan at 8:15 p.m. EST.
   Under congressional pressure, the networks had agreed this year
not to project any state results until a majority of its polls had
closed. All three networks gave Kentucky and Indiana to Bush while
more than 10 percent of their polls were still open.
   Because of differing time zones, the networks were able to
announce Bush the winner even as millions of voters had yet to cast
their ballots.
   ``The biggest single news story every four years is the exchange
of powers ... and the exit polls without question are the best
source of information for telling people'' what happened, said
Warren Mitofsky, elections and survey director for CBS News. ``What
we're trying to do is tell a news story.''
   Mitofsky, who blamed the botched Illinois call on ``the laws of
probability,'' said, ``I have never been pressured to get out a
projection faster than my competition.''
   ABC was so quick on the draw that it caught at least one
candidate by surprise. Informed on the air by ABC's Peter Jennings
that he had won a seat in the U.S. Senate, Virginia Gov. Charles
Robb said, ``Well, it's a little early to make any real post mortems
on the race since I haven't seen any real votes.''
   Barring government action, the networks are likely to dwell on
projections in the next election _ the Nielsen families seem to
prefer it that way.
   According to an analysis released by ABC News, the network called
68 U.S. Senate, gubernatorial and state presidential races first.
CBS projected 11 such races first, and NBC beat the competition six
times. Not coincidentally, ABC also had the highest overnight
television ratings.
   The ratings sample of 17 cities showed that more than 20 million
viewers were tuned to ABC from election night sign-on to sign-off.
NBC's coverage was seen by 14 million and CBS, even though it called
the presidential race first, was watched by less than 12 million
people.

   Lloyd Bentsen flew back to the nation's capital
on Wednesday not as vice president but re-elected to the Senate,
where he'll hold great sway over what George Bush can accomplish in
the White House.
   In his fourth term, Bentsen will return as chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, which oversees tax, trade and public welfare
programs.
   ``He can cut a pretty wide swath on a whole range of public
policy issues, and I suspect he will,'' said Joseph P. O'Neill,
Bentsen's campaign chief of staff.
   The Texas senator himself was silent on Wednesday, canceling a
news conference because of laryngitis. Before leaving Austin, he
visited a doctor and began taking antibiotics.
   Asked by reporters as he left his hotel to give a thumbs up or
thumbs down on whether Bush would get a honeymoon from Congress,
Bentsen just pointed at his throat and cupped his ear.
   He later scribbled a note to reporters on his campaign plane.
``Doctor says it is highly inflamed and must not talk,'' it said.
   At a party for campaign workers at the end of the election night,
Bentsen's voice was already cracking as he sounded a note of
conciliation with the Republicans.
   ``I'm committed to help George Bush,'' he said. ``I think the
time for partisanship comes at elections.''

   President-elect George Bush, barely pausing to savor a smashing
election triumph, began building a ``brand new team'' for his
incoming Republican administration on Wednesday. Disappointed
Democrats found solace in gains in both houses of the Congress.
   Bush staged a splashy, flag-waving return to Washington and said
he hoped to nourish a ``new era rich with possibility and full of
hope.'' He went with Vice President-elect Dan Quayle to the White
House to accept President Reagan's congratulations and promise of a
smooth transition.
   ``Time for us to go to work,'' said the outgoing president, and
the new man did.
   Bush made his first Cabinet appointment with unusual swiftness,
naming longtime confidante James A. Baker III his secretary of
state. He appointed a slate of aides to guide the transition to
power.
   ``The people have spoken and the verdict was clear,'' the
nation's duly chosen leader said. He won 40 states and nearly
complete returns gave him 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   Bush and Quayle take office on Jan. 20.
   Dukakis took his final bow on the 1988 campaign stage at a news
conference in Boston. He congratulated Bush on his victory, but said
it was based in large measure on campaign ``distortions.''
Nonetheless, he said he was not resentful, but rather disappointed.
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' said the Massachusetts governor. ``We
had our good days and our not so good days.''
   On his first full day as president-elect, Bush paused to praise
his rival.
   He said he would do his best to work with the new Democratic
Congress. ``I don't want us to talk at each other I want us to talk
to each other,'' he said. Democrats hold sway in both houses of the
new Congress, and by margins slightly larger than the last two years.
   With a close Florida race still undecided, Democrats could count
on at least 55 seats in the new Senate, a gain of at least one.
   They strengthened their command of the House, as well. Democrats
had at least 259 seats _ a gain of two from the old 100th Congress,
with three races still to be decided.
   Bush's first Cabinet appointment was surprising only in its
swiftness. Baker is Bush's friend, political mentor and hunting pal,
and a former chief of staff and Treasury Secretary under Reagan to
boot.
   Bush shied away from claiming a mandate, but of the election that
delivered him the Oval Office, he said, ``I don't think it was
overly close.''
   There was no disputing that.
   Nearly complete totals showed the vice president receiving 54
percent of the popular vote to 46 percent for Democrat Dukakis, and
Bush winning by a margin of nearly 7 million ballots. Bush won 40
states and 426 electoral votes; his rival won 10 states and the
District of Columbia, for 112 electoral votes.
   The inevitable Democratic second-guessing had begun, and
maneuvering was clearly visible for the next campaign. ``The Dukakis
campaign ran the worst campaign of this century,'' said Robert
Slagle, chairman of the Democratic Party in Texas, where voters
overwhelmingly snubbed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.
   The election was a low-turnout model of ticket-splitting.
   ``We knew we were going to have a tough row to hoe this year.
Peace and prosperity make it difficult to demonstrate a need for
massive changes,'' was the post-mortem offered by Rep. Guy Vander
Jagt of Michigan, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
   Democrats also picked up a net gain of one governor's office.
   But the biggest winner of course was the president-elect, and
Bush moved speedily to place his stamp on the government before
flying home to Washington aboard Air Force Two. On Thursday he
begins a long weekend of fishing on the Florida Atlantic coast.
   Bush, a man who has held diplomatic, political and congressional
jobs as well as headed the CIA and served eight years as vice
president, was clearly anxious to get on with the business of taking
charge.
   He described his personal feelings as ``somewhere between total
exhilaration and recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be
awesome.''
   Dukakis told Massachusetts residents he was ready to resume
duties as their governor. To his national audience, he said he was
disappointed but not bitter in the outcome of the national campaign,
but he fired off a few last salvos at the Bush organization.
   Asked whether he thought his own record as governor had
contributed to his defeat, he interrupted and said, ``The
distortions of that record contributed a great deal.'' He mentioned
Bush's use of the Massachusetts prison furlough program and polluted
Boston Harbor in advertisements and said Republicans set a standard
for negative campaigning that the nation ``may live to regret.''
   Bush's first appointments came as no surprise.
   In addition to Baker, Bush named chief of staff Craig Fuller and
pollster and senior campaign adviser Bob Teeter as co-directors of
the transition.
   Bush discussed few specifics on policy matters in a 30-minute
question and answer session with reporters in Texas, although he
said he would be ``holding the line'' on taxes.
   He made that a centerpiece of his campaign, and said, ``I don't
plan to deviate and I think the American people must have understood
that'' when they picked their new president.
   He also said Quayle would enjoy the same ``access to the papers,
access to the intelligence, access to the information'' that Bush
has had in the No. 2 slot. Bush did not cite specific duties for
Quayle, but said his vice president would meet regularly with him.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow In Colorado Rockies, Rain Scattered Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow brought welcome accumulations to some Colorado ski areas but
made some mountain roads treacherous Wednesday, and rain was
scattered over the Northwest and the center of the nation.
   The heavy snow tapered off to light snow and flurries by early
afternoon.
   Steamboat Springs, which hopes to open to skiers by Thanksgiving,
reported 16 inches of new snowfall. Eight inches of snow was
reported at Dillon, and 7 at Winter Park and Climax, according to
the National Weather Service.
   Visibility had been low in parts of the Colorado Rockies during
the night since Tuesday and Vail Pass was closed for about 2{ hours
because of the weather.
   Showers were scattered across the western and central Plains and
the middle Mississippi Valley by afternoon.
   Showers developing ahead of a storm system off the Pacific Coast
spread over western Oregon and northern California.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 24
degrees at Yellowstone National Park to 93 at McAllen, Texas.
Wednesday morning's official low was 13 degrees above zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   For Thursday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
along and ahead of a cold front extending from south-central Texas
through the central Gulf Coast states to Tennessee and North
Carolina. Showers were forecast from the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast into the middle and upper Mississippi Valley,
especially in the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes region. Snow was
forecast over Upper Michigan. Showers also were forecast from the
northern and central Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies.
   Highs only in the 30s were predicted in Minnesota and the
Dakotas; in the 40s elsewhere from the central Rockies to the upper
Great Lakes region; above 70 from the desert Southwest through the
Rio Grande Valley of Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast, including
highs in the 80s from south-central Texas to Florida and southern
Georgia; and generally in the 50s and 60s elsewhere across the
nation.

   Michael Dukakis returned to work as governor of
Massachusetts on Wednesday after losing his race for the presidency,
saying he was not bitter but concerned that the campaign's negative
tone ``set a standard that we will live to regret.''
   ``I gave it my best shot,'' the Democratic nominee told a news
conference the day after he lost the election to Vice President
George Bush.
   Dukakis, whose supporters had chanted ``'92'' _ the next
presidential year _ when his defeat became official Tuesday night,
wouldn't say if he harbored hopes of mounting another try for the
presidency in four years.
   He congratulated his Republican rival for a ``very decisive
victory,'' as he had in an election-night phone call to Bush.T
   But Dukakis said the election had delivered no mandate to the new
president, whose electoral vote total was 426 to the governor's 112
votes.
   ``I don't see a mandate _ not when the House of Representatives
has increased its Democratic membership and the Senate has increased
its Democratic membership,'' Dukakis said.
   He voiced regrets and frustraion over the negative tone of his
opponent's campaign and said distortions of his record as governor
had contributed to his defeat.
   ``I'm not a bitter person,'' Dukakis said.
   ``Am I disappointed? Sure I am,'' he said.
   ``It was a distorted campaign, it was a campaign that distorted
my record ... it may well have set a standard that we will live to
regret. But I'm not personally bitter.
   ``I hope it doesn't happen, but I fear that this will be a signal
now at the national level that this kind of campaigning is
effective.''
   Dukakis referred to Republican ``media manipulators'' behind
Bush's campaign. But he took no issue with Bush's announcement that
his campaign chairman, James Baker III, would be his secretary of
state.
   ``I believe in the redemption of souls,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis, who has two years remaining in his third term as
governor, arose the morning after his election as usual, and was in
his office at the Massachusetts Statehouse before 9:30 a.m.
   His Secret Service bodyguards, who have accompanied him since he
accepted protection in early May, were leaving him at the end of the
day. He could have kept them for another week to 10 days but chose
not to.
   The ever-serious governor drew chuckles from his news conference
audience when he said he and his wife, Kitty, would ``probably take
the weekend off.''
   He said he may take a vacation in a few weeks. With that already
in mind, his wife presented him with a book on Hawaii shortly before
the election.
   At his campaign's national headquarters in Boston, only a few,
teary-eyed workers had bothered to come by Wednesday afternoon. Some
television sets and furniture already were being removed, and some
staffers were making deals to buy the personal computers they had
used during the campaign.
   Dukakis avoided any detailed analysis of the reasons behind his
loss, but he refused to accept a reporter's suggestion that the
Democrats had been destined to lose because the public satisfaction
with their general prosperity under a Republican president.
   ``I think clearly, had things gone differently ... it was
winnable,'' Dukakis said.
   He acknowledged that Democratic presidential candidates must do
better in attracting support in the South and West, which have
become Republican bastions even though they elect Democrats at the
state level.

<HEAD>BOSTON: we did that.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   I'm not sure we got through as rapidly as I might have liked,
given the nature of the campaign that the Republicans were
conducting but, as you recall, I tried to lay out in great detail my
plans for our economy, for jobs, for education, for drugs, for
housing and health care, for the environment _ all of the things
that are important to the people of this country and that the next
president of the United States must provide leadership on.
   And I think, had I failed to do that, then the last two or three
weeks, when clearly we were making substantial progress, would have
been impossible. Because, had I been saying to the American people
at that time, `I'm on your side,' without having laid out a positive
agenda which gave them a sense of what that meant, then the last two
or three weeks would not have been as effective as I think they
were. So, that's what I tried to do and obviously, the other guy
won. Yes, Joe?
   Q. Governor, to follow up on that. You've called this the most
negative campaign that you can recall _ full of lies. The man who
directed that campaign was named by Mr. Bush today to be his
secretary --
   A. -- I beg your pardon?
   Q. The man who directed the campaign, James Baker, that you
called the sleaziest campaign that you can remember was named today
by Mr. Bush to be his secretary of state.
   A. Uh-hum.
   Q. What does that say? What's your reaction to that?
   A. I believe in the redemption of souls, Joe. Yes, Bill?
   Q. Even Republican souls?
   Q. If I could follow up on that. You're very conciliatory today
but, during the campaign, you made some very serious charges against
the vice president. You said that he was a liar, distorted your
record. You said his campaign had elements of racism. Was that
campaign rhetoric on your part or did you really mean it? And if you
really meant it, what would you say now to your supporters about how
they should regard the new president?
   A. Well, as a Democrat, obviously, we have a responsibility to
work with the administration. After all, Mr. Bush will be our
president and will be our president for four years.
   On the other hand, there's a responsible opposition. We will have
a responsibility to be constructively critical. I hope we can keep
it constructively critical. This country faces major challenges over
the course of the next four years _ debt, deficits, tough economic
competition, serious environmental problems that affect not only
ourselves but the world, major opportunities and challenges
internationally. And they're too important to be lost in a lot of
partisan bickering.
   So I hope both sides will do everything they can to work together
on a progressive agenda for this country. Certainly, Mr. Bush, in
the course of the campaign, indicated that he was prepared to break
with the outgoing administration on a number of areas. I'd like to
think that the campaign had something to do with that and that he
recognizes that the education of our children, the child care, the
quality of our environment, that early childhood education -- these
things, which he began talking about in the campaign, are very
important to the future of our country and to its families. And if
that happens and we get a good constructive agenda, in which both
the administration and the Congress are working together, then the
campaign will have been worth it.
   I certainly hope that's the direction in which we move, because
there's just too much to do to let this opportunity be lost in a lot
of partisan bickering. Yes?
   Q. Governor, given the last three weeks when you were not in
Boston, do you think maybe that it's too difficult or you spent too
much time back being governor? It's too difficult for a sitting
governor to run an effective campaign against a sitting vice
president?
   A. Well, I hope not, Tom. I've been asked this in the past, and
I've often said that I think it would be a tragedy if one either had
to be unemployed or hold an office _ and I don't mean this in any
way to belittle the vice presidency _ but to hold an office which
doesn't have any statutory responsibility. And I mean that.
   You know, if that's the only way you can run for the presidency,
then I think our system is in deep trouble. No question that, as a
sitting governor, I could bring both strengths and some liabilities
to this because, as you all know, certain things, which I had not
been a candidate for the presidency, would not have been magnified
anywhere near as much as they were.
   It took on new dimensions and new life. I consider it one of my
greatest achievements, one of my legislature's greatest
achievements, the cleanup of Boston Harbor, which has been under way
for four years. And yet, in the hands of some very skillful media
manipulators, if I may use that term, it became a liability. Similar
kinds of things. And that goes with the territory if you're a
sitting governor and you have ongoing responsibilities. I certainly
hope that it will be possible for sitting governors and sitting
senators and sitting members of Congress to run for this office, and
I think it would be a tragedy if they couldn't.
   Yes, Robin?

<HEAD>Corn Production Forecast Up Slightly from October Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn production is expected to total 4.67
billion bushels this year, 3 percent above last month's forecast but
still a drop of 34 percent from the 1987 crop, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   As farmers struggled to bring the last of the corn out of the
fields, the falloff in production reflected last summer's fierce
drought.
   The searing heat and lack of rain was reflected in an average
yield per acre of 83.2 bushels for corn forecast by USDA's
Agricultural Statistics Board. That was down 37.1 bushels from last
year but 2.1 bushels above the level contained in last month's
forecast.
   The harvest was the smallest since 1983, when another drought
lowered output to 4.17 billion bushels. The record was 8.88 billion
bushels in 1985.
   As of Nov. 1, farmers had harvested an estimated 83 percent of
this fall's corn acreage, 7 percent behind last year but still 16
percent ahead of the 1983-87 average, the Agricultural Statistics
Board said.
   Only 63 percent of the corn is normally harvested by now.
   This year, farmers cut back to a little over 56.7 million acres
for corn harvest from 59.1 million in 1987. One reason is
participation by farmers in government programs designed to take
acreage out of production and thus prevent surpluses that drive down
crop prices.
   Despite the drought, the Agriculture Department is forecasting an
adequate supply of corn next year, largely because of an abundant
existing stockpile.
   According to USDA economists, the drought is likely to add 1
percent to the consumer price index for food this year and 2 percent
next year as the impact of the reduced crop is passed through to the
market.
   Officials said the ``all crops'' production index as of Nov. 1
averaged 87 percent of the base year of 1977, down dramatically from
106 percent at the same time last year and the lowest level in 10
years.
   The index reached a record of 117 percent in 1981 and 1982 as
well as 1985 before dropping to 88 percent in 1983, when drought and
government acreage cutbacks lowered production. It rose to 111
percent the following year.
   Soybean production was forecast at 1.51 billion bushels, up 1
percent from last month's level but 21 percent below last year's
harvest of 1.92 billion bushels. The record was 2.26 billion bushels
in 1979.
   The cotton harvest was estimated at 14.8 million bales, 1 percent
above both the 1987 crop and the Oct. 1 forecast. The record was
18.95 million bales in 1937.
   With the harvest of 1988 crops winding down, no new production
figures were included for many earlier commodities, such as wheat,
oats and barley.
   Other crops in the November production report included:
   _Sorghum, 546.3 million bushels and 60.6 bushels per acre,
compared with 740.8 million and 69.9 bushels per acre last year.
   _Rice, 158.4 million hundredweight and 5,547 pounds per acre,
against 127.7 million and 5,482 pounds last year.
   _Peanuts, 4.12 billion pounds and 2,507 pounds per acre, compared
with 3.62 billion pounds and 2,341 pounds per acre last year.
   _Tobacco, 1.33 billion pounds and 2,114 pounds per acre, against
1.19 billion pounds and 2,028 pounds per acre last year.
   _Fall potatoes, 309 million hundredweight and 292 hundredweight
per acre, compared with 1.19 million hundredweight and 2,028
hundredweight per acre.

   Members of Gov. Michael Dukakis's own party are
planning what could be a rude welcome home to Massachusetts next
week: legislative oversight hearings on the state budget.
   Politicians of both parties agree Dukakis will have to pay
attention to the state's worsening fiscal condition when he returns
to work at the Statehouse.
   The slowdown in state tax collections, which Democrats were
willing to overlook during the presidential campaign, will take
center stage next Monday when the House Ways and Means Committee
begins examining the books on the state's $11.6 billion budget.
   ``Mike Dukakis will be crippled,'' said state Sen. David Locke,
the assistant leader of the 20 percent Republican minority in the
state Senate.
   Most Democrats, however, refused to go that far in assessing the
damage inflicted on Dukakis by his failed presidential campaign.
   ``It's going to be unpleasant,'' state Rep. William Galvin, a
Boston Democrat who is part of the House leadership, said of
Dukakis' return to the Statehouse.
   Even before Tuesday's voting, speculation was rampant in the
Statehouse hallways about Dukakis' future in Massachusetts. Two
years remain in his gubernatorial term, and Dukakis said nothing
Wednesday at a press conference to clarify his plans. out of production
and thus prevent surpluses that drive down
crop prices.
   Despite the drought, the Agriculture Department is forecasting an
adequate supply of corn next year, largely because of an abundant
existing stockpile.
   According to USDA economists, the drought is likely to add 1
percent to the consumer price index for food this year and 2 percent
next year as the impact of the reduced crop is passed through to the

   George Bush and Dan Quayle, America's new White
House team come January, were reunited Wednesday at a star-spangled
airport reception, then were told by President Reagan that their
victory means ``our achievements are secure.''
   Reagan, in an emotional salute to his Republican successor,
declared that ``to those who sometimes flatter me with talk of a
Reagan revolution, today, my hope is this: `You ain't seen nothin'
yet.'''
   Bush earlier had revealed that he planned wholesale replacements
of Reagan's government appointees, starting with James A. Baker III,
his campaign chairman, as the new secretary of state. But that ``has
nothing to do with satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the way
anybody currently is doing his job,'' Bush said. ``It has a lot to
do with reinvorating the process.''
   The president-elect, addressing a cheering crowd at Andrews Air
Force Base upon his return to Washington, extended a conciliatory
hand to Congress and also vowed to build on Reagan's openings with
the Soviet Union. He disclosed he had received a congratulatory
message from Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev and had
returned an equally warm reply through the Soviet ambassador in
hopes that ``we can keep this new bilateral relationship moving
ahead.''
   At the White House, Reagan told Bush and Quayle: ``How proud I
am, of both of you, for the extraordinary grit and character you've
shown ... With George Bush and Dan Quayle, I feel our achievements
are secure.''
   Bush replied that ``all I will say in the shadow of the office
that you've ennobled is that we're very, very grateful ... to you
and Nancy for going that extra mile. I really believe the results
would have been entirely different if we hadn't had that steadfast
campaign support.''
   ``And I know they would, if I hadn't learned from a giant,'' said
Bush.
   With more than 5,000 people packed into a hangar at the air base
in suburban Maryland _ and another 3,000 to 4,000 outside _ a band
struck up ``Hail to the Chief'' as the nose of Air Force Two, a
Boeing 707, poked into the open end of the hangar.
   As the invited guests on the military base roared with cheers,
first Bush and then his wife, Barbara, emerged at the top of the
stairs. They were followed immediately by Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, who had been picked up on the tarmac for delivery to their
admirers.
   It was Bush's first meeting with Quayle since the pair, in
separate cities, watched as America's voters gave them an
overwhelming victory Tuesday against their Democratic opponents,
Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.
   Bush said he hopes that America's adversaries ``do not indulge in
any hopes that our resolve will be weakened because we will continue
to be strong and we will pay the price for it.''
   Bush also had kind words for the vanquished Dukakis, noting that
in ``his gracious comments'' that Dukakis had offered to help build
a better America, ``and that's what it's all about.''
   He reiterated that he is determined to mend relations with the
Democratic-controlled Congress, saying, ``I don't want us to talk at
each other. I want to talk to each other.''
   Turning in Quayle's direction, he declared his controversial
running mate ``is going to be one of the great vice presidents. You
watch him closely.''
   Speaking with reporters on Air Force Two on the way to Washington
from Houston, Bush said he would make a series of Cabinet
appointments ``in a couple of weeks.'' Before leaving Houston, he
named Baker to replace George Shultz at the State Department and
``to get the whole process off on the right foot.''
   ``It will send a reassuring message. People will wonder about
change. It's nice to send a stabilizing signal around the world,''
he said.
   Bush said that he wanted to name his cabinet ``sooner rather than
way late'' and would think about some of the choices this weekend
while fishing in Florida.
   The vice president said he had received congratulatory calls on
Wednesday from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and from Sen. Sam
Nunn, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   On the subject of his transition, Bush said, ``Our job will be a
lot easier than the '80 transition. You don't have to send teams out
to every agency. I'm not going to do that. I know enough about how
the government works.''
   In Houston, Bush told his first post-election news conference
that his emotions were Somewhere in between total exhilaration and a
recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be awesome.''
   Bush said he did not intend to ``underestimate the challenge and
the seriousness that takes over right this minute.''
   Bush said his selection of Baker, a Houston lawyer whose
friendship with Bush dates back to the 1960s, had been ``personally
endorsed'' by Shultz.
   In other personnel announcements, Bush also said his current
chief-of-staff, Craig Fuller, and campaign pollster and strategist
Robert Teeter would head his transition team.
   However, Bush said: ``President Reagan is still the president of
the United States and I will not be using the transition to try to
make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the
president's.''
   He also said:
   _He is confident the Soviet Union will not abandon its commitment
to withdraw forces from Afghanistan. However, he said that if Moscow
went back on its word, ``That would throw a complicating factor over
the whole relationship'' between the superpowers.
   _U.S. aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua will have ``a high
priority because freedom and democracy in this hemisphere has a high
priority.''
   _He will give Dan Quayle, his incoming vice president, the same
access he enjoyed to intelligence documents and other papers that go
to the Oval Office. Bush said ``I haven't formulated in detail''
what Quayle's role will be but that ``It is essential that the vice
president be up to speed on every sensitive matter involving the
government lest something happen to the president.''

   Q. Governor --
   A. Just members of the working class --
   Q. -- what do you think is the first problem Mr. Bush is going to
have to deal with as President?
   A. The federal budget deficit _ clearly, it pervades everything
we do, will have a crucial impact on our ability to build a strong
economic future _ to turn that trade deficit around and turn it into
a trade surplus, to create economic opportunity on a very strong
base in this country.
   And that will take a very strong bipartisan effort, because it is
so important and is absolutely fundamental. If we can't get that
deficit down, and keep borrowing $150, $160 billion a year, and that
continues indefinitely, then this country's economic future is going
to be seriously jeopardized. Yes, Ken?
   Q. Governor, the Democratic party's going to be selecting a new
chairman to replace Paul Kirk who you supported four years ago. Do
you know who you'll support at this point?
   A. No, I don't, but I expect to be involved and participate along
with many of the party leaders and to do the very best we can, not
only to build on the progress we made over the course of the past
four years under Paul's leadership _ and we made enormous progress _
but to continue to build a strong consensus within the party.
   I said back at convention time, Ken, that I thought we had a
party which was more unified than it had ever been before, and I
believe that's the case. It's important that that continue.
   There are some differences on issues, but by and large, I think
there is a very broad consensus within the Democratic party, and I
would hope that that would continue and I'll do everything I can to
try to provide whatever leadership I can to make that happen. Yes?
   Q. You fared better than either of the last two Democratic
nominees, but both candidates lost whole regions of the country, the
South and most of the West. What lessons do you draw from this, and
what lessons should the party draw from this in the future?
   A. Well, obviously I didn't do as good a job as I should have
done in reaching out to those regions. We did better in the West, as
you know _ in the far West _ almost took Colorado, that's the first
time that's happened in a long time.
   And we did better in the Western states, obviously didn't do well
in the South. I think my values, the things I care deeply about are
things that people in the South care deeply about. And they've
demonstrated that on many occasions by electing strong, progressive
Democrats as governors and as members of the Senate and the Congress.
   But I wasn't successful in getting my message through in the
South and in some parts of the West. The fact, however, that these
regions continue to vote for progressive Democratic governors and
members of the Congress and state and county and local officials
tells me that these values and these hopes and aspirations for the
country are felt as strongly in the South and the West as they are
in other parts of the country.
   Now, how the Democratic nominee for president conveys that sense
is something which, obviously, is going to require us to spend a lot
more time working at. Obviously I didn't do it as well as I should
have.

   President-elect George Bush picked James A. Baker
III, a Reagan administration stalwart, as his secretary of State on
Wednesday but at the same time pledged a ``major turnover'' of
personnel to reinvigorate the government.
   Moving with unusual speed barely 11 hours after claiming victory,
Bush announced a handful of key appointments, headed by the
nomination of long-time ally Baker at State. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz enthusiastically endorsed Baker's selection.
   ``He's big shoes to fill,'' Bush said of Shultz, ``but we'll get
the job done.''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's vice presidential chief of staff, and
campaign pollster Robert Teeter will share authority as co-chairmen
of the transition team that will plan the takeover of power from
Reagan.
   In a declaration sure to send shudders through the ranks of the
5,000 political appointees happily at work in the Reagan
administration, Bush said, ``I will for the most part bring in a
brand new team of people from across the country.
   ``And in my view that will reinvigorate the process,'' Bush said.
   However, he carefully left room for some Reagan holdovers and
veterans to join his administration. ``There will be ... a major
turnover but some people at various levels may be asked to remain.''
   Returning to Washington aboard Air Force Two, Bush said he
announced Baker's appointment Wednesday, less than 12 hours after
declaring victory, ``to get the whole process off on the right foot.
It will send a reassuring message,'' he said.
   The president-elect said he wanted to announce the rest of his
Cabinet ``sooner rather than way late'' and would think about the
possible choices during a Florida vacation this weekend.
   It is widely assumed Bush will ask Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Education Secretary
Lauro Cavazos to stay on. All three joined the Reagan administration
in recent months.
   Thornburgh said Wednesday that he had been given no indication of
whether Bush wanted him to remain ``nor have I sought'' any
information on the question.
   The Washington Post reported that Bush wanted to replace
Thornburgh with former Environmental Protection Agency chief William
Ruckelshaus or Illinois Gov. James Thompson. Thompson said Wednesday
that he wasn't interested.
   Former Sen. John Tower of Texas, an arms negotiator in the Reagan
administration who later advised Bush's campaign on national
security matters, is expected to be in line for secretary of Defense.
   Ann Dore McLaughlin may keep her post as Labor secretary or get
another Cabinet position, possibly Interior, where she was
undersecretary from 1984 to 1987.
   Others mentioned as possible nominees for the Labor post include
Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., and Constance Horner, now director of the
Office of Personnel Management.
   Former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, wife of one-time
Bush rival Bob Dole, also is mentioned as a candidate for another
Cabinet job.
   For the powerful post of budget chief, the odds on favorite is
Richard Darman, a one-time senior aide in the Reagan White House and
later deputy secretary of Treasury.
   Darman's name also has been mentioned as the new White House
chief of staff, although Fuller and New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu
are more frequently discussed for that job. Sununu also is a
candidate to be secretary of Energy.
   Richard Burt, ambassador to West Germany, is known to be
interested in the job of national security adviser at the White
House. Brent Scowcroft, who served in that role for President Ford,
is mentioned for it again.
   Bush has 73 days to fill his Cabinet, make other key appointments
and determine the policy priorities to help him make a mark in the
critical first 100 days of a new administration.
   ``I will have a game plan,'' Bush promised. ``Part of what the
transition is about is to spell out the priorities. I spelled them
out in broad terms, in terms of keeping the economic expansion going
and in terms of world peace. But the election ended yesterday.''
   Now, he said, he will have to get specific.
   Over the next 2{ months, power will begin to shift from Reagan to
Bush as the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments look to the
incoming president for a signal of his intentions.
   However, Bush said, ``President Reagan is still the president of
the United States and I will not be using the transition to try to
make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the
president's.''
   Policy matters aside, Bush indicated his management style will be
different from Reagan's. For example, he said he will be briefed
directly every day by the CIA on intelligence matters instead of
relying on the White House national security adviser for an update,
as Reagan had.
   Bush's intention to put Baker at State had been a poorly kept
secret for months. The two men have longstanding personal and
political ties dating back to their years in Texas more than two
decades ago.
   Baker resigned his position at Treasury this year to run Bush's
presidential campaign, the same job he held eight years ago when
Bush ran unsuccessfully against Reagan.
   In addition to preparing to take over from Shultz, Baker also
will have a big hand in the transition decisions. Given the respect
he commands with Bush, Baker may be the key player.
   Bush also announced that Boyden Gray, his legal adviser in the
vice president's office, will serve the same role in the transition
and then go on to the White House as his general counsel.
   Chase Untermeyer, former assistant secretary of the Navy who has
been a one-man transition planner for Bush, will be the transition's
chief personnel headhunter and keep the same job in the White House
come Jan. 20. Sheila Tate, who has been the campaign press
secretary, will serve in the same capacity during the transition.
Bush did not mention whether she would have that title in the White
House, and some GOP sources close to the campaign indicate someone
else may get the job.
   Altogether, there are 5,000 political appointments, divided
between presidential appointments and those made by Cabinet
secretaries and agency heads.
   Many of the 3,000 or so presidential appointments do not really
draw the attention of the chief executive and are handled by others
   Even though Bush put Washington on notice to expect a house
cleaning of personnel, Untermeyer described the transition as ``a
friendly takeover.''
   On that basis, Bush said he anticipated a ``somewhat leaner
transition organization than we had in 1980'' when the Reagan team,
including volunteers, swelled to 1,500.

   The United States has the bald eagle and
the rose as national symbols. Tree lovers want a national tree.
   The International Society of Arboriculture has launched a
nationwide search for a tree lofty enough to represent the whole
country and is open to suggestions, says Harry J. Banker, chairman
of the society's national tree committee.
   Banker doesn't expect the search to be easy. ``I hope I haven't
bitten off more than I can chew,'' says the 75-year-old West Orange
resident. ``You know how many suggestions I might get? I think
plenty.''
   It took 75 years and 70 bills before the rose was adopted as the
national flower in 1986, he said.
   ``Fortunately, the bird emblem was approved way back in 1782,''
he said. ``But since that time, you'd be surprised. Some have even
come up with the wild turkey as a more appropriate emblem.''
   Banker said the tree would have to be one that is found around
the country to gain national acceptance, adding the oak may meet
such a qualification. But he expects regional entries like the New
England sugar maple and the California redwood and sequoia.
   ``A move like this will focus the attention of Mr. and Mrs.
America on the importance of conserving this very important national
resource,'' he said.

   An African Ground Hornbill is back in
captivity, and the Louisville Zoo believes that luck, not love,
ended his freedom.
   The 5-year-old bird flew the coop on Monday morning, leaving his
mate Violet. He returned Tuesday after spending the night in some
nearby woods.
   Zoo Curator John Keeley said he didn't know ``if he came back
because of Violet, whether he was familiar with the area and wanted
to get back to the exhibit, or if our catching him was just dumb
luck.''
   Keeler and his staff cornered the bird, valued at $1,500, in the
tall weeds along the zoo fence.
   About two feet tall, with black wings trimmed in white, a bright
orange face and a beak that's eight inches long, the hornbill had
nested at the zoo since last June.
   Keeley said Violet didn't seem to mind her mate's absence. ``She
didn't pace the yard, or seem upset that he left at all.''
   He said the zoo had noted some courtship activity, with the bird
making ostentatious displays and carrying twigs to Violet.
   ``There's even been some rudimentary nest-building,'' Keeley
said, ``so we don't know exactly what their problem is.''

   Two former lawmen acquitted on civil
rights violations in the death of a black jail inmate have filed a
$6 million lawsuit claiming two trial witnesses and two lawyers
concocted the case against them.
   In a malicious-prosecution lawsuit, former Sabine County
sheriff's deputies James ``Bo'' Hyden and William Horton accuse
attorneys Morris Dees and J. Richard Cohen of the Alabama-based
Southern Poverty Law Center of embarking on a scheme to prosecute
the men to amass ``a larger fortune by destroying (the men's) lives
and reputation.''
   They also contend two former jail inmates who testified at the
deputies' trial last summer joined in the alleged scheme.
   It is the latest round of litigation stemming from the Dec. 27
death of Loyal Garner Jr., a truck driver from Florien, La. The law
center will represent Garner's family in a federal civil lawsuit
scheduled to go to trial in April, Dees said.
   Dees denied the accusations in the deputies' action.
   ``It's a frivolous suit,'' he said Wednesday. ``It's the craziest
suit I've ever seen.''
   Hyden, Horton and Thomas Ladner, former Hemphill police chief,
were acquitted of civil rights violations charges last July in
Garner's death.
   During the trial, Ladner admitted striking Garner, jailed
Christmas night on suspicion of drunken driving, on the head with a
slapstick.
   The deputies' lawsuit, which seeks $2 million in actual damages
and $1 million in punitive damages for each plaintiff, was filed
late last month in the state court in Sabine County.
   Dees and Cohen represented Garner's family and helped press for
prosecution in the case.
   The deputies' suit claims Dees and Cohen ``wrested control from
the lawfully elected district attorney of Sabine County and
appointed their own agent and servant, John Hannah, to not only
prosecute the Sabine County criminal action but to use his position
to publicly destroy the plaintiffs.''
   Hannah is a former U.S. attorney who was appointed special
prosecutor for the trial.
   Dees said the law center had nothing to do with the criminal
prosecution. It was Garner's family who wanted Hannah, and his
appointment was approved by the presiding judge, he said.
   The suit also alleges that Dees and Cohen are continuing to
pressure the Smith County district attorney to pursue murder charges
against the three men although a state appeals court ruled earlier
this fall that the trial would represent double jeopardy. Garner
died in a hospital in Smith County.
   The lawsuit also accuses the defendants of ``inexcusable
conduct'' that ended in a fund-raising letter the law center mailed

   ``In only slightly veiled language, the mailing compared (Hyden
and Horton) to the Ku Klux Klan and implied that all southern white
people were racist and, based on this hate mail, they requested the
recipient to send in money to the Southern Poverty Law Center.''

<TEXT>
   Yes?
   Q. Governor, when you ran (inaudible) a number of the issues that
you put out in front were in the campaign for some time. On balance
now, do you believe that your record is what contributed heavily to
your defeat?
   A. I think the distortion of my record contributed a great deal
to the defeat, sure. I mean, you know, the use of the Willie Horton
case, which I have described _ I think correctly _ as being a very
cynical and hypocritical use of that particular case, was one.
   The attempt to turn what I've called one of our great
achievements _ and that is the cleanup of Boston Harbor _ into a
liability is another. And I could go on, but that goes with the
territory.
   And I don't think there's any question that the fact that I am a
sitting governor of a state that has been successful, and that all
my political career I've stood for the kinds of things that I've
talked about in the course of the campaign, I think was a plus.
   Some 40 million plus people voted for that record and voted for
that agenda, and I think that's more than has voted for a Democratic
candidate in a long time.
   Q. Governor --
   A. So, in that sense, we did get through, but almost doesn't
count in politics. Either you win --
   Q Governor --
   A. -- or you don't. Yes?
   Q. Governor, could you just take a minute to describe what you
see as George Bush's mandate?
   A. I don't see a mandate, not when the House of Representatives
has increased its Democratic membership and the Senate has increased
its Democratic membership.
   I think what the American people are saying is that they want
continuity, but they also want a government in Washington that will
be an activist government, will respond to their concerns about
jobs, about the quality of the education of their children, about
child care, about drugs, about the environment, about the things
that the American people care very deeply about. And, while they may
have expressed a desire to have some continuity in the presidency, I
don't think you can look at those results on the congressional side
and not conclude that they're also expressing some very strong
progressive feelings about what this country has to do, and that
they want a government in Washington which is on their side when it
comes to dealing with these problems.
   The challenge will be for the new president and the
administration and the Congress to work together to meet that
agenda, and I hope they will do so, and obviously I will do whatever
I can to help move that agenda along. Yes?
   Q. Governor, Jesse Jackson has said that he wants the party _
that the lesson of the election is that the party has to move to the
left and reach for the liberal agenda and embrace it. There are a
number of southerners, particularly, who are saying the party has to
move to the right, has to move to the center. Where do you fit with
this, and do you believe _ well, do you believe, sir, that a liberal
Democrat can win the White House at this point?
   A. I don't believe it's a matter of right or left. I think it's a
question of a Democratic party that's responding strongly and
forcefully and effectively to the concerns of average Americans.

   Diplomats said Wednesday they were not surprised by
president-elect George Bush's choice of James A. Baker III as
secretary of state in the next administration, and welcomed Baker as
a hard-working professional.
   Foreign officials and especially diplomats rarely like to comment
publicly on the internal affairs of another country. But in
off-the-record remarks, diplomatic sources gave good marks to Baker.
   ``He has contacts and experience, and I think he is a good
choice,'' said a West German diplomatic source in Bonn, who spoke on
condition his name not be used.
   A spokesman for West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said the minister had no comment. However, Genscher earlier
expressed confidence in Bush's abilities in foreign affairs and
expressed hope that the United States would continue its
rapproachment and disarmament efforts with the Soviet Union.
   ``It's not a surprise,'' a French diplomat said of Baker's
appointment. ``It was launched during the campaign. I think he is
part of a group of people (in Washington) who are very
professional.''
   Israel expressed a similar attitude in a statement from its
Foreign Ministry: ``We believe that the new president, together with
the future secretary of state, will play an active role in the
Middle East, and we are looking forward to working with the new
American leadership in full cooperation.''
   Baker, a former Treasury Secretary, is perhaps better known in
the world's finance ministries than in the foreign ministries, and a
common view among those interviewed was ``wait and see.''
   ``We don't know the state of his knowledge,'' said the French
source, noting that many foreign affairs professionals have not met
Baker.
   Baker, 58, spent the first four years of the Reagan
administration as White House chief of staff before switching to the
Treasury Department. In August, he took over as chairman of Bush's
presidential campaign.
   ``We look forward to working with the new administration,'' said
a British Foreign Office official, who by custom is not identified.
``(Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey) Howe knows Mr. Baker well ... He
is a well-respected and well-known figure.''
   The Soviet Union had no immediate comment. The official Soviet
news agency, Tass, announced the news in a dispatch from Washington,
noting that Bush said at a news conference that one of Baker's first
tasks will be to meet with his NATO colleagues and then with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   In Asia, Thai government spokesman Suvit Yodmani said of Baker:
``We welcome him to the new Republican administration and believe he
will continue a foreign policy inherited from President Reagan.''
   On the other hand, Yodmani said, the Bush government will be
facing tremendous pressure from the Democrat-dominated Congress to
push protectionist legislation, which the Thais and other Asian
countries fear.
   Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes, in an otherwise unflattering
analysis of the American election, described Baker as ``the
strongman of American politics.''
   ``This man, extremely able with a clear intelligence, manipulator
and Machiavellian, surrounded by a brilliant group of young
politicians, is James Baker,'' Fuentes wrote.

   Voter turnout in Tuesday's election was the
lowest since 1924 because the electorate felt little enthusiasm for
either presidential candidate and decided the ``rational'' choice
was to stay home, a political researcher said Wednesday.
   ``The American people will vote if they have something to vote
about,'' Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, a nonpartisan research and public policy
organization, said.
   But in George Bush and Michael Dukakis, the U.S. electorate found
nothing to motivate them toward the polls, Gans said.
   ``We had an unprecedented number of voters who said they didn't
like either candidate.'' Not voting, he said, ``became a rational
act.''
   By the time the counting ended for the day Wednesday, the
unofficial total presidential vote was 88,962,851, with 487 of
184,660 precincts yet to report final figures. The Census Bureau
estimated there were about 182,628,000 Americans of voting age,
which would mean a turnout of about 48 percent.
   ``I think the final voter turnout will end up right about at 50
percent,'' when uncounted and absentee ballots are included, Gans
said. ``That would be lowest turnout since 1924'' when between 48
percent and 49 percent of the eligible voters went to the polls.
   ``The turnout is down in every state of the union and the
District of Columbia, with the exception of Nevada and New
Hampshire,'' Gans said. ``It's conceivable that by the time final
totals are in that Nebraska and Colorado may be up. But if they are
up, they are up marginally.''
   Gans said the turnout in 1948 was 51.1 percent and there was a
steady decline thereafter until 1980 when 52.6 percent of the
eligible electorate cast ballots. In 1984, the number was 53.1
percent.
   ``There's been a decline of some 20 percent since the 1960
election,'' Gans said. ``There was a sharp slide between this year
and 1984, and there was also a slide between 1968 and 1972.''
   The 1988 race ``was a horrible election in a variety of ways,''
Gans said, ``and the people responded accordingly.''
   The low turnout was caused by a variety of factors, but the
primary reason was the conduct of the candidates, the coverage of
the campaign and the use of television advertising, he said.
   ``One candidate refused to say anything about anything but
competence and good jobs for good wages, and then refused to defend
the core values of his party,'' Gans said. ``The other candidate
nominated Dan Quayle and then engaged in fairly low forms of
demagogy without offering reasons for people to vote.''
   He blamed political and television consultants who ran the
campaigns and reduced the flow of information to ``seven-second
sound bites'' and to television commercials ``substituting for
debate.''
   ``The conduct of our campaigns has increasingly been put in the
hands of irresponsible political consultants,'' he said.
   Gans faulted the media for ``making polling a driving force in
the campaign'' and then ``writing off whole regions of the country
for one candidate.'' This, he said, discouraged vast numbers of
voters from going to the ballot box.
   He also criticized television networks for projecting the
eventual winner before polls close on the West Coast.
   ``Right now the West Coast states have by far and away the lowest
turnout,'' but final figures were not in, said Gans.

<HEAD>BOSTON: average Americans.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government by itself can't do it alone, but I think the
American people want a government in Washington which does respond
to their concerns, that works with communities, that works with
states, but that, above all, deals with some fundamental fiscal
problems that we face in this country, and that are not going to go
away, and some very fundamental concerns that average Americans,
their families, their communities have and will continue to have,
and I've laid those out in some detail.
   The Democratic Leadership Council, for example, proposed a rather
creative plan for youth service in this country _ something that I
think ought to be explored. Is that liberal or conservative? Is it
right or left? I don't know, but it's a very ambitious proposal to
involve young people in public service in this country _ something
which I talked about yesterday and which I think is extremely
important to the future of this country.
   I suppose if you asked them they'd say that they are more
moderate than some others, but that's a very ambitious, very
creative, a very important proposal. Those are the kinds of things I
think our party ought to stand for, that we'll stand for, and I see
a lot of agreement within the party. Yes?
   Q. Governor, if another Democratic politician who was trying to
run in 1992 came to you for advice, what advice would you give him
that, if you had understood it when you started out, it might have
been different?
   A. What do I say to that young man outside of Philadelphia? Smile
a lot. And respond somewhat more quickly to attacks against you.
   Look, there's no question of the negative campaigning, first. And
I had hoped that it would be possible to run a good, strong,
positive campaign, without having to take up a lot of time
responding to those kinds of attacks. But, one of the lessons of
this campaign is that you have to respond, you have to respond
quickly. That may mean that you have greater difficulty defining
yourself and why you're running _ the kind of positive agenda that
you want to put forth. But certainly, given my experience this time,
I think it means that you do have to deal with those kinds of
attacks, and have to call them for what they are, which, in this
case, were distorted and oftentimes absolutely false. Yes?
   Q. Governor, some of your staffers have said, if only you had had
more time you could have pulled yourself out. Do you believe that?
And if so, why didn't you start campaigning the way you did at the
end a little earlier?
   A. If I had more time, you'd all be in the hospital. And I
certainly wasn't going to do that.

<HEAD>BOSTON: do that.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. You know, there has to be a conclusion to every race, and
there's a pace to it, and there's a bell lap, and that bell lap is a
lap. But, I wouldn't have done that to you guys, I mean, I think too
much of you to do that. Yes, Ed?
   Q Governor, once again the Democrats have carried the vast
majority of black and other minority votes, but lost the election
rather decisively. Why do you think that is? And what do you think
it is the party has to do _ the party and its next nominee has to do
to reach out to those white people who seem to have abandoned it
permanently?
   A. Well, I tried very hard myself to do that, and I don't think
it's a matter of race. A good job at a good wage is something that
is important to every family in this country.
   Good schools for our children in every community. Drug-free
schools. They're important to every family. I think these are
unifying issues. Now, for whatever reason, I think in part because
of the nature of the Republican campaign, I wasn't able to do that
as effectively as I should have. But I think it's important to
remember that all over this country yesterday, Democratic candidates
for the United States Senate, Democratic candidates for governor,
Democratic candidates for the Congress did that, and did it in a way
which has now produced even greater Democratic majorities in the
face of a very decisive Republican victory for the presidency. What
does that tell you?
   Well, I think it tells you two things. That if you are able to
get that agenda and deliver your message directly to the people that
you're seeking to represent, that they will respond in a very broad
and very strong way. I've had that experience here in this state.
   It's obviously a lot more difficult when you're running as a
national candidate. And that may be one of the reasons why we
continue to win and win solidly at the state level all over the
country, and yet have had such a difficult time winning nationally.
Now, the fact that I did get the vote that I did, the fact that the
margin of defeat was a lot smaller this time than the last time _
all of those things, I think, are signs of hope for the future, but
it is clear, I think, that in these national campaigns, we'll have
to do a better job of making the point that these are issues which
bring us together as a country, and do the kind of job that
candidates for the Senate and governor are doing in states all over
America. Yes, Bob?
   Q. Can you compare your thoughts today, Governor, with 1978? The
result yesterday may have been a little less surprising than in '78.
On the other hand, there was more riding on it.
   A. It's a very different _ I have very different feelings, Bob,
and a very different reaction. Am I disappointed? Of course, I am.
   This is the most important political office in the world. I've
just spent 20 months of my life, with my family and with hundreds of
thousands of terrific people, working hard to win. And I'm
disappointed, they're disappointed, a lot of people in this country
are disappointed.
   But as you'll recall, because you were there at the beginning, I
said this was a very, very long shot. I'm proud of what we've done,
and I'm proud of the nomination we won. I'm proud of the support
that we developed, proud of this grass-roots organization, which in
many cases is going to be a lasting legacy of this campaign.
   The fact that we were able, in a remarkable way, to raise the
financial resources we had to raise by a broad-based effort, which I
think, at last count involves some 325,000 individual contributors.
And these are all going to be things that will stand our party in
very good stead in the future. But this is a very different
experience from 1978. Let me take _ let me take one last question.
Yeah?
   Q. Governor, in light of the outcome, do you feel any sense of
personal bitterness about the negative tone of the campaign, and
what you call the lies and distortions?
   A. I'm not a bitter person. I look forward. I'm fundamentally an
optimist and somebody who believes deeply in this country and in its
people.
   Am I disappointed? Sure I am. It was a distorted campaign. It was
a campaign that distorted my record, and I think, did not set high
standards for the kind of campaign we wanted for the presidency, and
may well set a standard that we live to regret.
   But I'm not personally bitter. The election was yesterday. We
have much to do. I believe in this country. I had _ we had wonderful
experiences all over the country. We met terrific people who are
making a contribution to their communities and states and country
every day. And, after we catch our breath a little bit and get back
in the routine of living at home and in our community and going to
work every day as governor of Massachusetts, I'll be in the thick of
the fight and doing everything I can to make sure that we respond to
the real concerns of the people of this country.
   And I will do that as I generally do _ with optimism, with
enthusiasm, and with great faith in this country and in its people.
Thank you all very much.

<TEXT>
   Kasdi Merbah, the new premier, formed a
government Wednesday as part of a shake-up prompted by rioting last
month that killed at least 176 people.
   In a referendum Nov. 3, Algerians overwhelmingly approved
constitutional changes designed to reduce the power of the National
Liberation Front, the only legal political party in this North
African nation of 25 million people since independendence from
France in 1962.
   Some of those changes give the premier expanded powers and make
him responsible to Parliament rather than President Chadli
Bendjedid, who appointed Merbah after the referendum.
   His Cabinet includes 12 new ministers and 10 from the previous
government. Four holdover ministers keep the same jobs.
   The new government's tasks will be to implement reforms approved
in the referendum and find solutions to economic problems caused
largely by the dramatic decline in the price of oil, Algeria's
principal export.
   Merbah's new ministers are university professors, technocrats and
businessmen apparently chosen for their skills rather than political
reasons.
   Boualem Bessaieh, a career diplomat and former culture minister,
becomes foreign minister in place of Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, who is
not in the new government.
   Aboubakr Belkaid, a professor who had been minister for higher
education, is the new interior minister, replacing Hedi Khediri, who
moves to transportation.
   Algerians went into the streets last month to protest a declining
standard of living, inflation, unemployment and food shortages.
Demonstrations in Algiers and provincial cities turned violent and
soldiers moved in.
   Officials said 176 people were killed in six days, but unofficial
counts put the toll at 400 or more.
   Bendjedid promised economic and political reforms, which began
with the referendum.

   President Reagan pledged on Wednesday a smooth
transition to the administration of President-elect George Bush and
urged Americans to ``put behind us the divisions and controversies''
of the election campaign.
   At a Rose Garden welcome for Bush and his running mate Dan Quayle
and their wives, Reagan complimented the two men and their defeated
opponents, Democrats Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, on their
campaigns.
   ``I want to congratulate both of you, as well as Governor Dukakis
and Senator Bentsen, in taking on the great challenge, and your
sense of public duty in seeing it through to the end,'' he said.
   He added his compliments to Bush and Quayle for ``going to the
people on the issues and asking for a mandate on critical matters
like the taxing and spending power, the nature of judicial
appointments, the strength of our defenses and the firmness of our
foreign policy.''
   ``I think that mandate has been unmistakably delivered, '' he
said.
   ``I feel our achievements are secure, our change now a permanent
feature of American government,'' the president said.
   ``Even as we accept the verdict of the majority and pledge to
protect, always, the rights of the minority, we put behind us the
divisions and controversies of the immediate past and begin anew,''
he said. ``So, it's a day for congratulations, yes, but it's also a
day for remembering that whatever may temporarily divide is far
outweighed by that which unites us.''
   In return, Bush thanked Reagan for his help in the campaign and
said: ``I don't believe there's a case in modern presidential
politics of a president who's worked so hard to help someone else
achieve this office ... I really believe the results would have been
entirely different if we hadn't had this loyal, steadfast campaign
support.''
   Earlier, Reagan appointed White House Chief of Staff Kenneth N.
Duberstein to head his transition team and said, ``We will work
closely with President-elect Bush and his team to ensure that the
transition is handled efficiently and effectively.''
   Duberstein, in an address to a forum sponsored by the American
Stock Exchange at the National Press Club, said Bush and Reagan
``are determined to produce the smoothest transition in American
history.''
   Asked whether Reagan would ask his political appointees to submit
their resignations, Duberstein said this is customary at the end of
an administration, but Reagan and Bush had not yet discussed it. He
said he expected some announcement on the subject within the next
few days.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's chief spokesman, said aides to
Reagan and Bush are expected to begin meetings Thursday to work out
the transition arrangements for the new administration.
   Reagan and Bush went into a private meeting in the Oval Office
after the Rose Garden ceremony. Fitzwater said they planned to
discuss the transition and other issues.
   Others on the White House transition team are Lt. Gen. Colin L.
Powell, the president's national security adviser; M.B. Oglesby,
deputy White House chief of staff; A.B. Culvahouse, counsel to the
president; John Tuck, director of the office of chief of staff; and
Danny Crippen, an assistant to the president.
   This team will work with a Bush transition team headed by the
vice president's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, and senior campaign
adviser Bob Teeter.
   Fitzwater said Duberstein would ``begin the transition process''
at a breakfast meeting with the president's Cabinet on Thursday. He
said they would also discuss ``upcoming presidential activities in
the remaining weeks of the administration.''
   He said Reagan would meet with his Cabinet later in the day to
``discuss transition plans, and the budget and other matters.'' The
president plans to submit a budget to Congress on Jan. 9, he said.
   He said the Bush transition team would work in a building
formerly occupied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Adminstration, which recently moved to nearby Silver Spring, Md.
   There were 3{ floors of space amounting to about 58,000 square
feet, about the same amount of space that Reagan had for his 1980
transition, he said. The transition was to have a staff of about 400.
   Bush's transition team will have a budget of $3.5 million
appropriated buy Congress.
   ``The White House has been planning for a transition for several
months,'' Fitzwater said, adding officials had been holding meetings
almost weekly since mid-August.
   Reagan said Duberstein arranged for about 300 members of the
White House staff to greet Reagan Wednesday morning as he walked
from his residence to his offfice.
   He said the president told them: ``I just don't have any words,
and that's unsual for me. You have been a great team and God bless
all of you. As far as last night, I think everything came out all
right.''
   Asked how much impact Reagan thought he had on the election,
Fitzwater said, ``I think the president feels that he did all he
could.''

<TEXT>
   Opponents of an AIDS reporting initiative
cheered its overwhelming defeat Wednesday but said they anticipated
new battles against what one expert called ``the forces of fear and
ignorance.''
   Dr. Laurens White, president of the California Medical
Association, said the rejection by voters Tuesday of a state ballot
measure requiring health professionals to report AIDs patients to
state authorities was encouraging.
   ``By defeating this misguided scheme, the voters of California
have once again demonstrated their common sense in dealing with
AIDs,'' said White.
   But others said the downfall of Proposition 102 will provide only
a short respite from more initiatives and legislative proposals
dealing with the epidemic.
   And their triumph was tempered by disappointment at approval of
Proposition 96, a law enforcement AIDS initiative permitting forced
testing of people charged with certain crimes.
   ``My fear is that when the Legislature reconvenes we will see
`Son of 102' introduced. We will do this all over again,'' said
Bruce Decker of Los Angeles, one of the managers of the campaign
against Proposition 102.
   Republican state Rep. William Dannemeyer, who sponsored the
initiative, said he would take portions of it to the Legislature.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, who caused a furor when he came out in
support of 102, stood by his position Wednesday.
   ``Some were trying to treat it as though the virus had some civil

   With 100 percent of precincts reporting, Proposition 102 was
defeated by 65.7 percent to 34.3 percent. The vote count was
5,788,664 voting no and 3,027,119 voting yes.
   The vote in favor of Proposition 96 was equally strong. It won by
62.3 percent to 37.7 percent. The vote count was 5,431,189 voting
yes and 3,289,373 voting no.
   Proposition 96 allows AIDs testing of people charged with crimes
if a health worker or other official suspects exposure to the
disease.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to death from infections and cancer.

   Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister who
directed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, said Wednesday he would
be the best man for the job in the next government.
   Sharon, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc, said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the center-left
Labor Party should be dismissed ``as soon as possible.''
   The 60-year-old former general now is trade minister and has been
a principal negotiator in the coalition bargaining that followed
last week's indecisive general election.
   Likud won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament and rival Labor
got 39. Either needs the 18 seats won by small religious parties for
a majority.
   Speaking on Israel television, Sharon expressed optimism that
Likud would be able to form a governing coalition.
   ``In other times, I would happy to be a foreign minister or a
finance minister,'' he declared, ``but during the last year we have
deteriorated to an unprecedented security situation in Israel.''
   His reference was to the 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, in which more than 300
Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed.
   ``Today ... I feel myself obliged to be defense minister,''
Sharon said. ``After the failure brought upon us, to my sorrow, by
Mr. Rabin, there is no other way but to repl0097

<HEAD>President Grants Resident Visa to British Actor Despite Drug Rap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday signed a bill to
grant actor Michael Wilding a resident visa despite a drug
conviction 14 years ago in Wales.
   The bill was sponsored by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who said he
came to know and respect Wilding when he was married to the actor's
mother, actress Elizabeth Taylor.
   The bill would exempt Wilding, the 34-year-old son of Miss Taylor
and the late British actor also named Michael Wilding, from a law
prohibing people with drug violations from being granted residence
status.
   Wilding lives in New York City and is in the cast of the
television soap opera ``The Guiding Light.'' He was convicted in
Wales in 1974, three years after three years after renouncing his
U.S. citizenship, of possessing marijuana and cultivating marijuana
plants. He returned to the United States in 1981.
   In sponsoring the bill, Warner said the actor's attorneys
anticipate the government would begin deportation proceedings soon.
   ``So far as I know, and his mother knows, Mr. Wilding has lived a
drug-free, law-abiding existence since the occurrence of the
offenses during his very early life,'' Warner said in a letter to
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Warner and Miss Taylor were married at his northern Virginia
estate on Dec. 4, 1976, and they were granted a no-fault divorce
Nov. 5, 1982, following a 14-month separation. He was her sixth
husband. The elder Wilding was her second.

   Republicans appeared to lose control of two state legislative
chambers and fall from a tie in a third, according to figures
compiled Wednesday by The Associated Press and the National
Conference of State Legislatures.
   The elections left Democrats in control of 32 state Senates and
36 state Houses, while Republicans controlled 16 Senates and 11
Houses. In some other state bodies, power was evenly split. Nebraska
has a non-partisan, one-house legislature.
   The outcome of Tuesday's election was in sharp contrast to the
elections of 1980, when Democrats lost 10 state chambers, and 1984,
when they lost seven chambers.
   The Republican National Committee said party officials had
expected better results. But GOP strategists said they believed the
party did make a net gain of 16 to 30 seats in the nation's state
legislatures.

   A computer ``virus'' that infected software at the
University of Houston's business school has destroyed some data, but
officials say it poses no real danger.
   The virus is more a nusiance than a threat, said Michael Walters,
director of research and instructional computing services.
   ``It probably hasn't cost us much except a few days of
people-time to clean up these disks, but it probably cost the
students a good bit of frustration,'' Walter said last week.
   A computer virus is a string of coded commands hidden in
programs. Like a biological virus, it uses its host to reproduce,
replicating itself into other programs used on the same computer or
into computers to which it is connected.
   The affected university computers were isolated, and the virus'
spread was limited, Walters said.
   Last week, a sophisticated virus spread throughout a computer
network used by universities and defense contractors and eventually
affected an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide.
   The Texas virus appeared to be a version of the so-called
``Brain'' computer virus that was traced to a computer store in
Lahore, Pakistan.

<TEXT>
   Children of victims will preserve
the memory of the orgy of genocide launched 50 years ago with a
night of horror the Nazis called Kristallnacht, a Jewish leader said
Wednesday.
   Heinz Galinski, leader of West Germany's 32,000 Jews, later went
to a ceremony in East Germany, whose Jewish population is only
450-600. He urged East and West Germany to make the anniversary a
joint day of rememberance of the Nazi past.
   Some Jews objected to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's presence in the
Frankfurt synagogue where Galinksi spoke, and he was heckled from
the balcony. They cite his 1985 visit with President Reagan to the
Bitburg cemetery where 49 Nazi SS officers are buried, and an
alleged insensitivity to Jewish concerns.
   On Tuesday, someone spray-painted swastikas and pro-Nazi slogans
on a synagogue in the Bavarian village of Binswangen, police
reported.
   Adolf Hitler sent gangs of Nazi thugs into the streets the night
of Nov. 9-10, 1938. They killed scores of Jews, burned hundreds of
synagogues, ransacked 7,500 Jewish businesses, destroyed thousands
of Jewish homes and rounded up 30,000 Jews for shipment to
concentration camps.
   A similar rampage occurred in Austria, Hitler's homeland, which
he had annexed to the Third Reich eight months earlier. About
200,000 Jews lived in Austria then. There are 7,000 now.
   Shattered glass covered the streets after the terrible night and
the Nazis, in a boastful mood, named it Kristallnacht, which in
English is Crystal Night.
   ``The responsibility cannot be divided,'' said Galinski, a
75-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz death damp. ``Specifically, it
is the joint responsibility of both German nations for the past they
have in common.''
   In Vienna, the Austrian parliament observed a minute of silence
for the victims.
   Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York and two other activisits from his
Coalition of Concern symbolically re-enacted the Nazi practice of
forcing Jews to wash the streets of Vienna with toothbrushes.
   At an evening ceremony in the community center adjacent to
Vienna's only synagogue, Jewish leader Paul Grosz said millions of
Austrians ignored the fate of the Jews half a century ago.
   ``Not the blind hate, not the lust to get one's hands on Jewish
money, but indifference led to all those unmentionable things that
we still have not overcome,'' he said.
   Roman Catholic layman Paul Schulmeister apologized for the
failure of Austria's predominantly Catholic population to help the
Jews. About 100 young Austrians marched to the synagogue behind a
banner saying, ``Austria, when will you forgive your victims?''
   Felix Schrott, who helped carry the banner, said they were
protesting a tendency to suppress Austria's past.
   East Germany continued to dwell on support Communists gave the
Jews during the Holocaust that took 6 million Jewish lives.
   Erich Honecker, president and Communist Party chief, said in a
message to the small Jewish community that Communists and Jews had
been friends and allies in the ``anti-fascist struggle.''
   Horst Sindermann, president of the East German parliament, made a
speech Tuesday rejecting responsibility for Nazi atrocities. He
repeated the East German argument that German Communists stood by
the Jews.
   West Germany has paid more than $45 billion to victims and their
families. East Germany has not paid reparations.
   Wednesday's ceremonies in Frankfurt and East Berlin were among
hundreds of events in towns and cities throughout the two countries.
Historians agree Kristallnacht was the start of the Nazi attempt to
exterminate European Jews.
   Ernst Breit, leader of West Germany's DGB labor federation, said
a national Holocaust memorial should be created as ``a clearly
visible sign that we Germans are aware of our historical guilt and
responsibility.'' He spoke at the site of the former Dachau
concentration camp outside Munich.
   In Israel, President Chaim Herzog urged Israelis to reconcile
their internal differences and declared: ``Let's not forget that, to
our enemies, these differences are non-existent.''
   Galinski delivered the main address in a service televised live
from West End synagogue, the only one in Frankfurt that survived
Kristallnacht, during a national day of atonement.
   Before entering the synagogue, U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt told
reporters: ``This commemoration is important so that we never forget
what occurred here, so that it never happens again.''
   In his address, Galinski called the Holocaust ``the past that is
not finished and cannot be overcome'' and denounced attempts to
diminish the Nazi horror.
   ``You may deceive yourselves with the hope that one day there
won't be any more witnesses, no one who from personal experience can
raise a veto to the distortion of history,'' he said, ``but you are
forgetting that our children, the children of the victims, will ...
take our task upon themselves.''
   ``The younger generation _ just as we ourselves _ are always on
guard against a return of the indescribable,'' and the children
``will never forget,'' he said.
   West End synagogue was badly damaged on Kristallnacht and has
been refurbished _ its stone walls, majestic pillars and sweeping
arches returned to their original splendor. Police surrounded it
Wednesday in case of attacks on the dignitaries inside.
   One of two hecklers shouted from the balcony during Kohl's
speech: ``Mr. Chancellor, what about Bitburg?'' Then both called
out: ``Mr. Chancellor, why are you lying? We want our rights!''
   ``Let me finish,'' Kohl responded.
   His address also took up the theme of coming generations. He said
``the death of the last eyewitness'' cannot be permitted to mean the
end of recollection.

<HEAD>Jackson: Bush Got No Mandate, Must Now Abandon Rhetoric For
Substance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, saying George Bush ``in no
ways'' got a mandate from the American people, on Wednesday called
on the president-elect to turn away from hackneyed campaign rhetoric
and address the more substantive issues he must face as president.
   ``Willie Horton will not be on the president's desk on Jan. 21.
The flag passion contest is behind us,'' Jackson said in a speech to
international investors here.
   Horton, a convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough from a
Massachusetts prison and raped a woman, became one of the
Republicans' political weapons against Democrat Michael Dukakis as
they accused him of being soft on crime.
   Bush also criticized Dukakis for vetoing a Massachusetts law that
would have required teachers to lead their students in the Pledge of
Allegiance, and even made one appearance at a flag factory.
   Jackson said that while Bush won 54 percent of the popular vote,
``it was in no ways a mandate.''
   ``His coattails did not carry with it the governors, and
congresspeople and senators. So what it does mean is that more
cooperation is required between the president and the Congress and
the Senate,'' Jackson said.
   Bush ``cannot just run legislation through based on popular will.
He cannot whip the Congress or Senate in line.''
   ``The Congress and Senate need the president, the president needs
the Congress and Senate, and maybe that's just the way it ought to
be, shared power and shared responsibility.''
   He said Bush's pledge to build a ``kinder, gentler nation'' could
only be translated into a real commitment to fight poverty and help
disadvantaged children and families. He said the nation's burgeoning
deficit was another issue that must be faced by the new
administration, and Bush's pledge not to raise taxes would just make
the problem worse.
   ``What we can't afford is more supply side campaign rhetoric as
national policy ... What we need today is to wrestle with
presidential-sized questions, not just the flag, not just a criminal
set loose, to move beyond inciting fears ... to grapple with the
great questions of our day on a national and global scale,'' Jackson
said.
   Jackson said Dukakis had conducted ``a gallant campaign'' and
``done his best against the odds'' and he declined to make any
specific criticism of his campaign.
   ``We'll continue to work together,'' he said.
   Although the Democrats had failed once again to capture the White
House, Jackson said the ``essential Democratic message is a strong
message.''
   ``I am heartened by the fact that in the last days of the Dukakis
campaign, he took his case to the people and showed more of his
truer self. The people began to respond,'' Jackson said.
   Asked by reporters whether he would run for president again in
1992, Jackson said he had ``not yet made that decision, not even
given it serious consideration.''

   An airman opened fire with an automatic
weapon at people praying in a mosque at a military base in Jessore,
then turned the weapon on himself, the Defense Ministry said
Wednesday.
   It gave no casualty figures, but journalists in Jessore said at
least 10 people were killed in the shooting Tuesday night, including
the airman, and 50 wounded. They said most were believed to be air
force personnel.
   A Defense Ministry statement said: ``Some casualties occurred
among the worshipers as a result of indiscriminate firing without
any apparent reason'' at the Matiur Rahman base.
   Air force officers and civilian officials in both Dhaka and
Jessore, about 85 miles southwest of the capital, refused to give
casualty figures.
   Witnesses said funeral services for an unknown number of
``uniformed personnel'' were conducted Wednesday morning at Shaheen
College next to the military quarters in Dhaka.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper that supports Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government announced George Bush's victory
Wednesday with a proverb: ``A one-eyed man is king in a country of
the blind.''
   El Nuevo Diario used the phrase in a headline to point out the
low turnout among U.S. voters, which allowed the Republican
candidate to win the U.S. presidency with a minority of the voting
population.
   The same newspaper quoted President Daniel Ortega as saying a new
administration could pave the way for bilateral talks and improved
relations with the United States.
   But Bush's victory also may mean a renewed request to Congress
for military aid to the rebels known as Contras, which have been
strongly supported by President Reagan since 1981.
   Ortega, at a news conference Tuesday night, said ``it wouldn't be
strange'' if Bush requested military aid, which ended Feb. 29, but
termed it ``a very serious error.''
   Bush said Wednesday that aid ``would have a high priority because
freedom and democracy in this hemisphere have a high priority.''
   The staunchly anti-Sandinista newspaper La Prensa praised Bush's
call for renewed Contra aid with a banner headline saying: ``Bush
Promises To Maintain Pressure For Liberty In Nicaragua.''
   The paper also ran an editorial calling on the Sandinista
government to grant the requests of Nicaraguans for ``liberty,
peace, democracy and progress'' as a start towards normalizing
relations with the United States.
   A member of the Contra leadership, Wilfredo Montalvan, said in a
telephone interview from Miami that his organization would demand a
clearly defined policy from the Bush administration.
   And rebel commander Enrique Bermudez, in a clandestine Radio
Liberacion broadcast Wednesday, said the Contras would turn over
their arms ``only in exchange for democracy and liberty.''
   The Reagan administration, claiming Nicaragua is a communist
beachhead, cut off aid to Managua in 1981 and began funding the
rebels. A trade embargo was imposed in 1985, and the Sandinistas
blame the United States for their nation's disastrous economy.
   The majority of the Contras have moved out of Nicaragua in the
past few months, since U.S. military aid stopped. They are now in
base camps in Honduras, where they are receiving non-lethal aid such
as food, medicine and uniforms.
   A fragile truce between the Sandinistas and Contras signed March
23 ended most of the fighting but failed to bring a final resolution
to the war.
   Reliable sources in the region quoted several rebels recently as
saying they had received up to 3,000 new AK-47 rifles from an
undisclosed source. The Sandinistas claim the Contras are preparing
to reinfiltrate.
   The official Sandinista newspaper Barricada ran a story about
Bush's victory under the headline, ``Ex-Director of the CIA in the
White House.''
   ``For the first time a former director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, hated organization of the underworld of
espionage and clandestine American intervention in varied parts of
the word, will assume the presidency of the United States,'' said
one of its stories.
   Political parties opposed to the Sandinista government expressed
their pleasure at the Bush victory. Bush said Wednesday he would
press Sandinista leaders to adhere to their pledge, made to the
Organization of American States, to maintain freedom and democracy.
   Ramiro Gurdian, vice president of the anti-government Superior
Council of Private Enterprise, smiled Tuesday night at an election
party thrown by the U.S. Embassy.
   ``The Republicans are on our side,'' Gurdian said. He was
surrounded by Nicaraguans, mostly opposition figures, chomping on
hot dogs, sipping American beer and casting straw ballots for a mock
U.S. presidential election.
   Bush won by a landslide.

<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout to FIX that privatization already

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department on Wednesday
denied a request that it investigate the economic fitness of Trans
World Airlines Inc. in connection with the recent privatization of
the carrier.
   TWA was taken private on Oct. 24 by its owner and chairman,
financier Carl Icahn. The move has been criticized by the unions
representing pilots and flight attendants at TWA, who argued that it
will drain the airline of cash and weaken its financial condition.
   The unions and the Consumer Federation of America petitioned the
DOT to investigate the privatization to determine whether it affects
the financial fitness of TWA.
   Representatives of the two unions _ the Independent Federation of
Flight Attendants and the Air Line Pilots Association _ were
unavailable for comment Wednesday on the DOT decision.
   The department said in an opinion issued Wednesday that TWA
``continues to be fit, willing and able to perform its certificated
operations.'' It said the petitioners had ``failed to present a
convincing prima facie case that implementation of TWA's
privatization ... will prevent the carrier from remaining fit.''
   The DOT said it was, therefore, dismissing the petition without
further action.
   ``The DOT opinion is further confirmation that the privatization
of TWA will not in any way impact on our operations or our ability
to serve the needs of the traveling public,'' TWA General Counsel
Mark Buckstein said in a statement issued in New York.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Former Attorney General John Mitchell suffered
an apparent heart attack Wednesday and was rushed to George
Washington University Hospital, officials said.
   Ambulance units arrived and found Mitchell unconscious, but
breathing, on a Georgetown sidewalk, said an ambulance dispatcher
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mitchell stopped breathing as he was being taken to the hospital,
and cardiopulmonary resuscitation had to be performed, she said.
   Mitchell, 75, served during the Nixon administration and was
regarded as the closest Cabinet advisor to President Richard M.
Nixon.
   Mitchell was the oldest and last of the 25 Watergate defendants
to go to prison. He served 19 months of a 2{-to-8-year prison
sentence for conspiracy, obstruction of justice and lying under oath
in connection with the Watergate cover-up.
   Of the 19 months in the federal prison in Alabama, five were
spent on medical furlough for two operations _ one to replace a
section of abdominal artery and the other to have a plastic hip
socket inserted.
   He was released from prison in January 1979.
   Mitchell, formerly a leading municipal bond specialist and senior
partner in Nixon's old Manhattan law firm, was chairman of Nixon's
election campaign in 1968. He resigned as attorney general to run
Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972, but quit that post as the
Watergate scandal began unfolding.
   After his release from prison, he was disbarred and unable to
practice law.

   A rabbi said Wednesday the state of Iowa
violated his constitutional rights when he was denied permission to
erect a 20-foot menorah at the state Capitol.
   State attorneys, however, said the display amounted to
``excessive freedom of religion.''
   Rabbi Moishe Kasowitz was given permission in December 1986 to
erect the menorah, but the authorization was rescinded shortly
thereafter when officials learned that the candelabrum, the
traditional symbol of Judaism, was 16 feet wide at the base and 9
feet across at the top.
   Kasowitz sought an injunction and was refused first by a district
judge and again by a federal judge.
   Following the appeal, the parties agreed that Kasowitz could
erect the menorah for one religious ceremony on Dec. 28, 1986.
   Kasowitz' lawyer Paul Zoss argued before the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals on Wednesday that Kasowitz' First Amendment freedom
of expression rights were violated by the denial during the 1986-87
Hanukkah holidays.
   Zoss is seeking a ruling that what Kasowitz wanted to do was
within the realm of his constitutional rights.
   The menorah was to stand in a public place on the Statehouse
grounds designated for such holiday displays, Zoss said.
   ``The state should remain neutral, if it be a cross, a milk cow,
as long as it's recognized as a public place,'' he said. ``The state
shouldn't get into the business of evaluating what is in a public
forum.''
   Zoss said the public ``isn't so naive'' as to believe the
erection of a menorah implied state endorsement of Judaism.
   Iowa deputy attorney general Gordon Allen said the menorah was so
big a flatbed truck was necessary to bring it to the site.
   ``The state has determined ... that this is excessive freedom of
religion,'' Allen said.
   Allen said the menorah ``would be visible for miles'' and would
amount to an endorsement of Judaism.
   That would ``cross the line'' on the separation of church and
state, said Allen.
   Chief Judge Donald P. Lay of Minnesota asked Allen if a Christmas
tree were located on the state grounds.
   Allen said yes.
   ``Do you decorate it with angels?'' asked Lay.
   ``We did in 1986 but didn't in 1987,'' responded Allen.
   A ruling is not expected for at least a month.

   ``I was coming back from getting my skateboard, and I saw him

fell. ``I started pounding on my door and my mom got mad at me, but
I just ran to the phone and called the paramedics.''
   Mitchell was indicted March 1, 1974 on one count of conspiracy to
obstruct justice, two counts lying to a grand jury, one count of
perjury, one count of lying to FBI agents and one count obstruction
of justice.
   The former attorney general was convicted of conspiracy,
obstruction of justice, two counts false statements to grand jury

   Afghan authorities on Wednesday
released a West German doctor and nurse after two months'
imprisonment on charges of entering the country illegally, state-run
Kabul radio said.
   The broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said Dr. Benno Spliet and
nurse Lea Hochstalt were released after the government received a
letter from the West German government. The contents of the letter
were not revealed.
   The two were captured Sept. 8 as they traveled to Pakistan after
six months of treating Afghan war wounded in Afghanistan's central
Bamyan province, the radio said.
   Both work for a private aid group called the Committee of West
German Emergency Doctors, it said.
   Kabul radio also said 1,200 Pakistani army officers disguised in
local garb slipped across the border Tuesday and carried out ``a lot
of terrorist activity'' in Hazarnow district, several miles inside
Afghanistan. It said several people were killed but did not
elaborate.
   Pakistan repeatedly has denied charges by Afghanistan that it is
sending military personnel across the border.
   Kabul has been backed by Soviet troops in its eight-year fight
against Moslem insurgents seeking to topple the Marxist government.
The rebels are based in Pakistan.

   The last vice president who won a
succeeding presidential election had been branded by his critics as
sort of a wimp, a Northeastern dandy out of touch with the common
folks and who ``drank wine out of fancy cups.''
   But Martin Van Buren prevailed, and George Bush, the target of
nearly identical snickering 152 years later, was very much aware of
that precedent _ and the huge interval it took for any other vice
president to match it.
   In Houston Wednesday, President-elect Bush expressed his
gratitude to his family, his campaigners and the American voters,
then took an extra moment ``to thank Martin Van Buren for paving the
way. It's been a long time, Marty.''
   Like Bush, Van Buren had spent much of his adult life in public
service. He was a New York state legislator, then governor, senator,
and U.S. secretary of state in Andrew Jackson's first term, vice
president in the second. Like Bush, he served a popular,
nationalistic two-term president in times of peace and prosperity.
   But a selective profile could just as easily fit the image of
Michael J. Dukakis. Van Buren was a short, liberal Democrat, a
former Northeast governor with strong ethnic roots. And unlike Bush,
he was not born to the privilege so ridiculed by his critics.
   A dozen incumbent vice presidents have succeeded their bosses,
but only four by election. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the
nation's second and third presidents, were the first two.
   Some called the long drought which kept the second fiddles from
moving to the first string the ``Van Buren jinx.'' But most
historians say that difficulty winning a presidential election
simply goes with the vice presidential turf.
   ``When you're vice president, you don't stand on your own,'' said
Bruce Stewart, superintendent of the Martin Van Buren National
Historic Site in Van Buren's native Kinderhook, 130 miles north of
New York City. ``You're always associated with someone else. You're
linked more with the outgoing president than as your own man.''
   And voters' typical desire for change has kept most incumbent
deputies out of the White House, noted Stewart, who oversees
Lindenwald, the mansion to which Van Buren in 1840.
   Van Buren, a Dutchman, helped found the Democratic Party, and his
behind-the-scenes dealing built the foundation for today's
convention and electioneering process, Stewart said.
   But Van Buren's Democratic ``liberalism'' of the 1830s would fit
today Republican platform and could have come straight from the desk
of Ronald Reagan, said George Berndt, a historian at Lindenwald,
which is run by the National Park Service. ``To a large extent, Van
Buren believed in the policies of the present Republican Party,'' he
said.
   For example, Van Buren's was a strong advocate of states' rights,
feeling that the federal government should not intrude on social
issues.
   For Van Buren, the charge that he had little regard for common
people dug deep, said Donald Cole, a historian in Exeter, N.H., who
specializes in the Jackson era.
   ``Van Buren was considered kind of feminine, aristocratic,'' said
Cole, whose book, ``Martin Van Buren and the American Political
System,'' was published by Princeton University Press. ``His
opponents liked to say he drank wine out of fancy cups.''
   That even became part of the opposing Whig battle cry in 1840,
when Van Buren lost his re-election bid to William Henry Harrison,
said Michael Henderson, assistant curator at Lindenwald.
   Harrison forces used the slogan, ``Would you rather have a goblet
of champagne or a glass of cider?'' to imply that Harrison, born in
a log cabin, was closer to the electorate than the genteel Van Buren.
   Van Buren was born a tavern keeper's son among the Dutch settlers
in Kinderhook. He built his wealth from a law practice fashioned
after long apprenticeships.
   Van Buren was Jackson's campaign manager in 1828 and the top
adviser in the president's ``Kitchen Cabinet'' through his two
terms, Berndt said. He was Jackson's hand-picked successor.
   While Bush exults in matching Van Buren's accomplishment, there's
another ``jinx'' associated with the little Dutchman he has yet to
overcome. Van Buren got beat, by William Henry Harrison, when he ran
for re-election.

<HEAD>Church Critical Of British Arms Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church of England leaders called on the British
government Wednesday to apply moral principles to arms sales and
deplored the country's massive weapons trading.
   The policymaking General Synod of the Anglican state church urged
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to use her influence with U.S.
President-elect George Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to persuade them to abandon research on weapons in space.
   In a series of show-of-hands votes that appeared to be almost
unanimous, the synod also called on Mrs. Thatcher to work for a
comprehensive ban on nuclear tests and to renew efforts for a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons, ``including international
agreement on effective measures against those countries which use
them.''
   The resolutions on the third day of the five-day meeting ended a
lengthy debate on a synod working party report called ``Peacemaking
in a Nuclear Age.''
   The report did not oppose all arms deals, saying: ``What is evil
is not the weaponry as such, not even nuclear weapons. The evil, or
good, resides in the action of governments, that is of human
beings.''
   Bishop of Oxford Richard Harries, who chaired the working party,
said: ``Clearly, if a friend is being oppressed and you cannot _ or
feel it would not be right _ to come to his aid physically, you can
at least give him the means to defend himself.''
   Harries said nuclear weapons had overshadowed the role of
conventional weapons.
   ``Thirty million people have been killed by conventional weapons
in conflicts since World War II,'' he said.
   Harries cited reports that Britain has overtaken the Soviet Union
to become the world's second largest arms supplier after the United
States.
   ``We reject the notion that arms are a product to be sold
commercially as vigorously as possible, like any other,'' he said.
   British arms sales last year topped a record $6.4 billion and are
expected to account for one-fifth of all world arms sales this year.
Britain recently won its largest ever overseas order, a $24 billion
contract from Saudi Arabia for military and civil aircraft,
helicopters, minesweepers and avionics.
   Anti-nuclear protesters demonstrated quietly at the entrance to
Church House, Westminster, before the debate.
   The Rev. Clive Barrett, chairman of the Anglican Pacifist
Fellowship, said the protesters rejected ``Peacemaking in a Nuclear
Age'' because it was based on acceptability of the concept of
nuclear deterrence.
   ``I do not believe that `to dissuade by fear' is acceptable
Christian behaviour when one is considering the ultimate fear of
complete destruction,'' Barrett said.
   But Bishop of Salisbury John Baker, who was responsible for a
church report in 1983 which favored unilateral nuclear disarmament,
said: ``Effective deterrents cannot act on bluff. It cannot be a
charade. Those in charge of nuclear weapons have to be prepared to
use them and there is the anguish.''

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who
wants Puerto Rico to remain a U.S. commonwealth, narrowly defeated
statehood advocate Baltasar Corrada del Rio to gain a third term,
according to nearly complete election returns Wednesday.
   Corrada del Rio, the mayor of San Juan, conceded defeat at noon,
21 hours after the polls closed in Tuesday's election.
   ``I will continue fighting for statehood, but obviously with
Hernandez Colon in the governor's office, this will be difficult,''
he told a news conference at his New Progressive Party headquarters.
   In San Juan's mayoral race, the State Electoral Commission
reported at 7 p.m. Wednesday that New Progressive Party candidate
Jose Granados was leading with 86,366 votes, or 48.05 percent.
Popular Democratic party candidate Hector Luis Acevedo was close
behind with 86,122 votes, or 47.91 percent.
   Hernandez Colon had claimed victory Tuesday night, but his
opponent clung to hopes of pulling out a victory from late returns
from San Juan and the capital's suburb of Bayamon. As those came in,
the governor's victory became apparent.
   With 1,650 of 1,754 voting centers reporting, official results
gave Hernandez Colon 853,013 votes, or 48.7 percent; Corrada del Rio
802,438 votes, or 45.8 percent. Independence Party candidate Ruben
Berrios Martinez had 94,443 votes, or 5.3 percent.
   Election returns indicated Hernandez Colon's Popular Democratic
Party had consolidated a majority in the legislature.
   His party won 36 seats in the 51-seat House of Representatives.
The Independence Party won one seat and the pro-statehood New
Democratic Party 14.
   Late Wednesday afternoon the State Electoral Commission reported
that with nearly all votes counted the Popular Democratic party won
18 Senate seats, the New Progressive party nine and the Independence
party none.
   Hernandez Colon had supported Michael Dukakis in the U.S.
presidential elections because the Democratic candidate was
pro-commonwealth. Republican George Bush, who won the presidency,
backed Corrada del Rio.
   ``We will concentrate on working on the problems of Puerto
Rico,'' said Hernandez Colon. ``It will be hard to deal with our
political status with a president who was already committed to
statehood.''
   First elected in 1972 and re-elected in 1984, Hernandez Colon,
51, wants continued commonwealth status for the island but wants
Washington to grant more autonomy in immigration, foreign trade and
labor matters.
   Puerto Rico has been a U.S. commonwealth for 36 years and the
island's 3.3 million Spanish-speaking residents are U.S. citizens.
But they don't pay U.S. taxes and can't vote for president.

   John N. Mitchell was a political innocent when
he piloted Richard M. Nixon's 1968 political campaign to victory and
was rewarded with a Cabinet post as attorney general.
   In the early days of the administration, political observers
began calling Mitchell the Cabinet officer closest to Nixon. The
quiet, pipe-smoking Mitchell agreed with the political observers.
   ``I guess I see him once a day or more, when I go over to the
White House,'' he said during the early Nixon years. ``And during
the course of the day we usually talk on the telephone several more
times. In the evening he frequently calls me at home. ... I think he
hears my views on most important questions and I think he values my
judgment.''
   Nixon and Mitchell first met after Nixon _ defeated both for the
presidency in 1960 and for the governorship of California in 1962 _
moved to New York in 1963 and became a partner in the law firm of
Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie and Alexander.
   Mitchell, an expert in municipal bond law, was the top man in the
firm of Caldwell, Trimble and Mitchell. Frequently, the two men
teamed, with Nixon representing the underwriters of bonds and
Mitchell the users.
   From these encounters came the idea of merging the two firms. A
close friendship developed betwen the two lawyers.
   When Nixon decided to seek the 1968 Republican presidential
nomination, Mitchell did field work for him, making use of his
friendships with politicians formed during his years in municipal
bond law practice. Later, Mitchell ran Nixon's successful campaigns
for the nomination and for the presidency.
   When a group of Republican congressmen grumbled about having an
unknown in that role, Mitchell replied:
   ``I've made more money in the practice of law than Nixon, brought
more clients into the firm, can hold my own in argument with him
and, as far as I am concerned, I can deal with him as an equal.''
   Throughout the 1968 campaign, Mitchell said he would not take a
high federal post if Nixon were elected, but on Dec. 11, 1968, Nixon
introduced Mitchell on television as his choice for attorney general.
   Mitchell, Nixon said, was as devoted as he was to ``waging an
effective war against crime in this country.''
   Mitchell said that although he preferred ``a quieter life of
practicing law and playing golf,'' he accepted the appointment
because Nixon insisted upon it.
   He soon made his imprint on the Justice Department, contending
that his conception of the department was as ``an institution for
law enforcement, not social improvement.''
   Mitchell soon became known as a strong advocate of law and order.
   An aide who stood beside Mitchell on a Justice Department balcony
during an anti-Vietnam War march on Washington overheard him mutter
as he watched the young people in the street below, ``Looks like the
Bolshevik revolution to me.''
   Mitchell's detractors called him cold, distant and irascible
while his supporters during the early days called him a pragmatist
who ``never loses his cool.''
   During his tenure as attorney general, Mitchell was often
embarrassed by his wife, Martha. She had the disconcerting habit of
telephoning reporters in the middle of the night to complain about
how Nixon was mistreating her husband. At one point, she claimed she
was drugged to keep her quiet.
   But Mitchell, at least in public, laughed it all off and was
solicitous toward her.
   Mitchell resigned as attorney general to run Nixon's re-election
campaign in 1972 and it was from that post that he became embroiled
in the Watergate scandal.
   He was indicted March 1, 1974 and was convicted of one count of
conspiracy, obstruction of justice, two counts false statements to a
grand jury and one count of perjury. He served 19 months of a
2{-to-8-year term at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. He was
released in January 1979 and was disbarred.
   Throughout the scandal and afterward, Mitchell and Nixon remained
friends. Mitchell never publicly uttered a harsh word about Nixon
and never permitted his defense lawyers to do so during the lengthy
investigation and his own trial.
   Mitchell kept a low profile following his release from prison,
avoiding most interviews and refusing to discuss the scandal with
reporters he had frequently accused of blowing the case out of
proportion.
   Mitchell was born in Detroit, Sept. 15, 1913. He was raised on
suburban Long Island, attending public schools. He attended Fordham
University because it had an accelerated law program. After two
years as an undergraduate, he went directly into law school,
attending night classes and working during the day.
   Mitchell's career was set during his second year in law school
when he secured a clerk's job at the firm of Caldwell & Raymond
which had a specialty in bonds.
   He became a junior partner in the firm and quickly set out to
become a specialist in municipal bond law. He became so expert that
he was named a partner before he was 30.
   World War II interrupted his career for three years during which
he was commander of the PT squadron in which John F. Kennedy served
as a lieutenant.

   Leaders of a one-day strike were fired
Wednesday for organizing the walkout to protest a government
decision to close Lenin Shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity,
state media reported.
   The announcement came hours after strikers at two shipyards ended
their protests at the request of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who
argued that there was ``no other path than reconciliation.''
   The state-run PAP news agency said the director of the Repair
Shipyard in Gdansk ``sacked the inspirators of the strike action''
at the 4,500-worker yard.
   It did not mention firings at the other yard that was struck, the
1,000-worker Wisla Shipyard.
   On Thursday, ``all employees will be admitted to work with the
exception of those who have been given notice,'' PAP said. It did
not say how may workers were dismissed.
   The immediate publicity given the firings seemed to signal that
authorities are taking a tough line against strikers. The move also
seemed likely to undercut Walesa, who had urged strikers to moderate
their actions.
   Hundreds of mainly young workers went on strike Tuesday, without
Walesa's approval, demanding reversal of a government order to begin
liquidation of the Lenin Shipyard on Dec. 1. They ended the strikes
after repeated appeals from Walesa and a threat of dismissals from
management.
   ``I would like to thank very much all the striking people, the
youth, for subordinating to my request,'' Walesa said at St.
Brygida's Church, a headquarters of the banned trade union, soon
after hearing of the end of the second strike.
   Solidarity was crushed in 1981 with the imposition of martial law
and outlawed the following year.
   ``I hope in the future, if there is such a necessity, we will
fight together,'' Walesa said.
   Walesa argued that striking was counterproductive at the moment,
and attention should be focused on starting blocked talks with
authorities and the opposition on Poland's future.
   ``For Poland there is no other path than reconciliation, meeting
halfway to solve our problems, including social, political and
economic pluralism,'' he told reporters.
   But he added: ``We will fight for the shipyard sooner or later,
and we will regain it.''
   An undetermined number of workers gave up a strike Wednesday
morning at Wisla Shipyard, which makes yachts and small river craft,
after being promised that those who took part in the strike would
not be fired, the yard's strike leader Jan Stanecki said. He said
several hundred workers supported the strike.
   At the Repair Shipyard, 200 workers who rallied Wednesday morning
ended their strike at around 1 p.m., one hour after management said
they must leave or be fired, said Krzysztof Kamolak, one of the
strike committee members.
   ``We decided to leave because it made no sense to fight,'' he
said.
   Walesa said he continues to face resistance from young workers
who are impatient for promised round-table talks to begin. The talks
were offered by the government in August, in exchange for which
Walesa ended Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years.
   ``I can't complain about the youth, who are fed up with the
conditions in which they live,'' Walesa said.
   Preparations for the talks broke down when Walesa refused to
purge from Solidarity's proposed delegation two people whom the
government has deemed extremist. Solidarity also says it will not
talk until authorities hire back about 100 coal miners fired for
striking in August.
   Walesa said Tuesday he was not as concerned about an immediate
reversal of the closure decision as before, and that he might talk
to authorities even without a guarantee of the yard's future.
   The government announced Tuesday that the Lenin Shipyard's
director, Czeslaw Tolwinski, who previously protested the closure,
has been put in charge of the liquidation. Solidarity activists said
Tolwinski assured Walesa that the closure will not be abrupt.
   But Walesa complained he still has had no reply to a letter he
sent Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak last week calling on
Kiszczak to remove the obstacles to the talks.
   The government also claims it wants the talks to begin, but it
says it would be useless to talk to extremists. Officials object to
longtime Solidarity advisers Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron.

   The 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs attacked
Jews and their property throughout Germany and Austria, brought
together on Wednesday children still learning their history and
adults who lived through the worst of it.
   Kristallnacht is known among Jews as ``the beginning of the
end,'' Rabbi Mitchell Smith of the Hillel Foundation in Tucson, Ariz.
   Persecution of Jews in Germany had begun in the early 1930s, but
the night of Nov. 9, 1938, marked the beginning of large-scale
violence and murder of Jews.
   ``It also meant that many Jews woke up to the realization that
they could no longer hope to live in Germany, even if their family
had been there for 500 years,'' Smith said.
   The violence that ushered in the Holocaust, the Nazi slaughter of
6 million Jews, was remembered Wednesday at candlelight vigils,
memorial services and panel discussions. Many Jews planned to burn
memorial candles at their homes.
   Kristallnacht is German for ``crystal night,'' evoking the shards
of glass from windows smashed by the Nazis.
   ``My parents finally came to the realization after that night
that we had to get out of Germany or we would never survive,'' said
Gerda Wilchfort, who was to talk about Kristallnacht in Tucson.
   In New York City, a service at the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations included a procession of worshipers bearing Torahs
into the chapel and the ark, where the Torah _ the first five books
of the Bible that contain the basic tenets of Jewish law _ is kept.
   Organizers said this symbolizes the hope for the future of the
Jewish people.
   Nighttime events in New York included the ringing of bells at
Catholic and Protestant churches throughout the city and an
ecumenical service attended by Mayor Edward I. Koch and Roman
Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor.
   An eight-block candlelight vigil was scheduled by children from
The Ramaz School in Manhattan to the Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun.
   ``By carrying a candle _ symbol of the flames that burned that
night in every city and village _ each child is a link from the
horror of the past to the hope of a different future,'' organizers
said in a statement.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and the Los Angeles City Council
proclaimed Wednesday a remembrance of Kristallnacht.
   ``Let us hope that never again will the civilized world sit idly
by while this kind of barbarism takes place,'' said Bradley who
presented the proclamation to concentration camp survivor Fred
Diamond.
   ``I do this in the names of the hundreds of thousands who
suffered on this night, and also of the millions who later were
murdered,'' said Diamond as he accepted the proclamation. He spent
five years in Nazi concentration camps, and said most of his family
perished in the holocaust.
   At the Jewish Community Center on Mercer Island, a Seattle
suburb, a ceremony was to include the lighting of 191 candles to
represent each synagogue destroyed in Germany that night. Joseph
Frankel, 72, a witness to Kristallnacht in Frankfurt, was to speak.
   ``The Gestapo came to the door and told us we had just five
minutes to line up,'' said Frankel, who was 21 at the time.
   ``We lined up in an arena near the railroad station, with the red
and yellow glow in the sky from the synagogues burning, and the
sirens and the police. Young people, old people _ all just waiting
there, not knowing our fate,'' he said.
   Frankel, who said he and other Jews were forced to stand still
for 19 hours, said ``the memory (of that night) never wears off.''
   Gretel Oppenheimer of Chicago found her dog dead on the doorstep
of her Stuttgart home, shot by Nazis, on Kristallnacht.
   ``For me, it's impossible to think Kristallnacht happened half a
century ago,'' said Ms. Oppenheimer, 80. ``Every day since, I've
lived like it was only last night.''
   It could have been called the night of shattered illusions, Ms.
Oppenheimer said.
   ``My twin brother had already emigrated to America, as I wanted
to,'' she said. ``But right up to '38 my father kept saying: `It
will pass. Don't worry. These Nazi thugs are not the real Germany.'

<TEXT>
   The Air Force on Wednesday grounded the
nation's fleet of B-1B long-range bombers for a precautionary safety
inspection following a crash of one of the new planes in Texas.
   The Strategic Air Command, which is responsible for land-based
nuclear bomber and missile forces, said the order to suspend flying
was a ``normal precaution'' in the wake of a major accident.
   The flight suspension order will be followed within the next day
or two by specific instructions to B-1B mechanics on what aircraft
systems they must inspect, said Lt. Col. George H. Peck, a spokesman
at SAC headquarters in Omaha, Neb.
   Those instructions will probably reflect the suspicions of the
official board of inquiry that is investigating Tuesday's crash of a
B-1B near Dyess Air Force Base, Texas.
   Peck said he did not know which systems would be checked and
would not speculate on the cause of the crash.
   ``But the inspection is expected to require two to four hours per
aircraft,'' he said. ``This is a one-time special inspection.''
   At Dyess, training flights continued throughout the day
Wednesday. Officials there said the planes had passed the inspection
ordered by the Strategic Air Command.
   Eyewitnesses to Tuesday's crash have said they saw smoke and fire
trailing an engine on the plane. All four crewmen managed to eject
safely from the stricken bomber, which then crashed in a field
outside Abilene, Texas.
   ``The headquarters of SAC has ordered a one-time safety
inspection as a normal precaution,'' Peck said. ``Once the
inspection is completed, the aircraft will return to flying status.''
   The spokesman said the flight suspension order would not affect
the B-1B's currently standing alert, ready for immediate takeoff in
the event of nuclear war.
   In Texas, the Air Force set up a roadblock to seal off the crash
site Wednesday and sent in military investigators, who spent the day
mapping the area and searching through debris.
   The wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles,
said Al Dostal, an Air Force spokesman.
   Tuesday's crash was the second involving a production-model B-1B
in 14 months, leaving the Air Force with 98 of its original 100
planes.
   The bombers have been deployed at four bases: Dyess; Ellsworth
AFB, S.D.; Grand Forks AFB, N.D., and McConnell AFB, Kan.
   In Omaha, Peck said the vice commander of the 28th Bombardment
Wing at Ellsworth, Col. David C. Dill, has been named to head the
crash investigation.
   The spokesman added the board of inquiry already had begun
interviewing the crewmen at Dyess.
   The Air Force has said the plane's pilot, Capt. Michael E.
Waters, elected to stay with the burning bomber after his three
crewmen ejected to ensure the plane came down in an unpopulated area.
   The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B is the first new addition to
America's manned bomber force in more than 25 years. The plane is
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and
the new B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber, which is to be publicly unveiled
later this month.
   The Air Force lost the first of the B-1Bs on Sept. 28, 1987, when
a plane based at Dyess ran into a flock of migrating pelicans during
a low-level bomb run at a Colorado flight range. Three crew members
were killed.
   Earlier, before production-model planes entered the inventory,
the Air Force lost a B-1A prototype in August 1984 during a test
flight at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. One crewman died and two
were injured.
   The bomber, built by the Rockwell International Corp., has a
maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000
miles. It is smaller than the older B-52 but capable of carrying
more bombs, and already holds a number of world aviation speed
records for a plane of its size.
   The B-1B is designated as ``a low-altitude penetrator,'' meaning
it is expected to fly at almost the speed of sound at altitudes of
only 200 feet. During a nuclear war, the B-1B would be the bomber
expected to actually fly missions inside the Soviet Union.
   The Air Force has been criticized over the past two years for its
handling of the B-1B program, primarily because of acknowledged
problems in developing the bomber's radar-jamming gear. However, the
service insists the plane is still the best long-range bomber in the
world.

<HEAD>Ulster Policewomen Win Sex Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Ireland's police force
agreed Wednesday to pay $1.6 million in compensation to 310
policewomen who alleged sex discrimination by Chief Constable Sir
John Hermon.
   The Northern Ireland Police Federation said Hermon refused to
renew the officers' contracts on the grounds they could not carry
out full policing duties. But Hermon would not allow them to bear
firearms or be trained in their use, it said.
   The police officers' association said the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the British province's regular police force, agreed to
pay the compensation in an out-of-court settlement.
   The women, former and current part-time and full-time members of
the RUC Reserve Force, took their case to an industrial tribunal in
Belfast in 1982.
   Their claim followed the introduction of a policy to phase out
full-time women reservists in 1980 and then, two years later, to
restrict duties of part-time members of the force.
   The Police Federation said it was delighted with the award.
   ``Our support for our women colleagues has been vindicated,''
said a spokesman, who declined to be identified in keeping with
British practice.
   One policewomen, who asked that her name not be used for security
reasons, said: ``Naturally we are over the moon. This has been a
six-year battle, and it has been a long fight, but at the end of the
day it has been worth it.''

   The bodies of two 13-year-old girls were
found in woods near a cemetery Wednesday, apparently the victims of
a murder-suicide, police said.
   Although there was no note to indicate a murder-suicide pact,
Montgomery County, Md. police spokesman George Ludington said one
girl apparently shot the other in the head as they were sitting on
the ground in the woods and then turned the gun on herself.
   ``They were fully clothed, wearing blue jeans, hiking boots, and
plaid flannel shirts,'' Ludington said, adding that police did not
suspect foul play.
   Investigators said the girls had been dead about 24 hours when
they were found in the rear of a building at about 11 a.m. by a man
hiking through the wooded area between the Parklawn Cemetery and a
condominium development in Bethesda, Md.
   ``The only property we found was a pack of Camel cigarettes, a
butane lighter, a pistol with an extra clip of ammunition, and a
single house key,'' Ludington said.
   Two girls matching the descriptions of the dead teens had been
reported as runaways Tuesday, Ludington said.
   Police traced the girls to their homes in Rockville and
Kensington, Md., through missing person reports. Officials also said
a pistol was missing from the home of one of the girls.
   Police were withholding the names of the victims pending
identification by family members.
   No motive for the shootings has been determined.

   The death toll from Typhoon Skip
soared to 129 Wednesday, bringing to nearly 600 the number of people
killed in three storms that pounded the Philippines in the past two
weeks.
   The toll included 39 deaths reported Wednesday and government
officials said tens of thousands of people remained homeless.
Authorities said they expected the toll to rise as communications
are restored to stricken areas.
   The government weather service downgraded Skip to a tropical
storm Wednesday as it moved farther into the South China Sea toward
Vietnam. A weather bulletin said the storm's top winds had weakened
to 69 mph.
   The government's Office of Civil Defense said the latest deaths
reported were from the island of Tablas, which was in the path of
Skip as it hammered the central Philippines Monday and Tuesday with
heavy rains and winds up to 110 mph.
   Nick Garcia, a civil defense spokesman, said a fatality report
received via military radio from Tablas did not say how the 39 died.
The report said all roads on the island, 160 miles south of Manila,
were impassable, Garcia added.
   Earlier, reports from the civil defense office and the Philippine
Red Cross indicated that the hardest hit area was Palawan island,
where 36 people were killed in widespread flooding. At least 70
others were reported missing on the island.
   Also hard hit was Camarines Sur province on southeastern Luzon,
where landslides and tornadoes killed 26 people, including 20 in an
avalanche that hit Pasacao, a community 160 miles southeast of
Manila. Thirteen other people were listed as missing in that
avalanche, they said.
   At least 13 people drowned in three Manila suburbs flooded by the
rain-swollen lake Laguna de Bay, officials said.
   Fifteen deaths reported were on the islands of Panay, Cebu,
Marinduque and Mindanao.
   The Social Services Department reported at least 1 million people
were affected by Skip, meaning their homes or property were
destroyed or damaged. The Office of Civil Defense said more than
70,000 people were homeless.
   Skip was the 20th cyclone to hit the Philippines this year and
the third since Typhoon Ruby ravaged virtually the entire country
during the last week of October.
   Officials said Typhoon Ruby killed 181 people on land, and at
least 64 others perished in the sinking of the passenger ship Dona
Marilyn. More than 200 others were reported missing and presumed
dead in the sinking.
   Officials said Tropical Storm Tess, which swept through the
Visayas Islands on Saturday, caused floods that killed 11 people.
   The Department of Agriculture said Typhoon Ruby caused $80.7
million in damage to crops. Rice losses accounted for half of the
amount, the department said in a report to President Corazon Aquino.

<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Democratic complaint over Senate race.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Unofficial returns from Wyoming's tight
U.S. Senate race gave incumbent Republican Malcolm Wallop a
1,310-vote edge over Democrat John Vinich, but the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Commmittee is charging irregularities in the
handling of absentee ballots.
   In the Wyoming presidential race, George Bush took the state's
three electoral votes with 105,858 votes, or 61 percent, to 66,573
votes, or 39 percent for Michael Dukakis.
   According to unofficial returns in the senate race, Wallop
received 91,098 votes, or 50.4 percent, and Vinich got 89,788 votes,
or 49.6 percent.
   Wallop's campaign claimed victory, but Democrat John Vinich
refused to throw in the towel.
   Secretary of State Kathy Karpan said that after reviewing the
campaign committee's allegations with 23 county clerk's offices, she
had no reason to call for a recount in the contest.
   ``It appears to me that we have had an election that has been
carried out with regularity and with legality,'' Karpan said.
``There are mistakes in these things and that's why they call them
(the results) unofficial.''
   Deputy Secretary of State Margy White said was contacted
Wednesday by a DSCC attorney, who said the committee had obtained
its information through an election night telephone poll of county
clerks.
   ``He's charging that there are irregularities in the ballot
process,'' she said, ``that absentee ballots were mailed to parking
lots, duplicate ballots (were sent out) on the basis of a single
application, that the ballots were delivered after a phone request
as opposed to written application, that the counties are saying that
they would not give them the exact number of absentee ballots that
were sent out.''
   Karpan said the problems with ballot numbers may have arisen when
DSCC telephone pollers failed to explain when they called county
clerks that they needed specific information.
   Wallop's margin of 1,310 votes was just enough to avoid an
automatic recall under Wyoming law.
   Karpan said state law requires a recount if the difference
between the two candidates' votes is less than 1 percent of those
cast for the winner. In the case of the Senate race, the difference
would have to have been less than 911 votes.
   However, a candidate may request a recount if he agrees to pay
for it. Recounting the votes would cost a maximum of $11,500, Karpan
said.
   Vinich, a state senator, said Wednesday his campaign was still
considering whether to ask for a recount.
   The vote totals, provided by county clerk's offices, were not
known until mid-morning Wednesday, more than 12 hours after the
polls closed Tuesday night. Part of that was due to confusion over
counting of some 1,600 absentee ballots in Vinich's home county of
Fremont. Early Wednesday the clerk's office reported tallies of the
absentee ballots would be delayed because they were being counted by
hand.
   The office later said figures it had reported from county polling
places actually had included absentee ballots as well.

   Lotteries, gun control and the anti-abortion movement triumphed
at the polls on Election Day. But tax revolt measures were trounced
in three states even as Californians signaled a new revolt: against
auto insurance rates.
   Californians also overwhelmingly rejected an initiative that
would have forced doctors to report AIDS patients and approved one
allowing AIDS testing for some people accused of crimes.
   Massachusetts and Nebraska voters gave votes of confidence to
nuclear power, and Florida, Colorado and Arizona made English their
official state language.
   Results of major contests among the 238 ballot issues in 41
states:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAR INSURANCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   California voters narrowly approved an auto insurance reform
proposal backed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. It would cut
premiums by 20 percent below November 1987 levels and give an
elected insurance commissioner control over future increases.
   Voters rejected four rival proposals including two advanced by
insurers who waged a $60 million media campaign to thwart what they
feared might be the start of a nationwide ``car insurance revolt.''
   The Nader-backed measure was approved by 4,528,783 votes, or 51.2
percent, to 4,320,205, or 48.8 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>AIDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Californians rendered a split decision on AIDS. They rejected one
proposal to force doctors to report AIDS patients and to make it a
felony for persons who know they have the disease to donate blood or
engage in prostitution. But voters approved another, by 64-36
percent, allowing AIDS testing of people accused of certain crimes.
Backers said it was designed to help protect rape victims and law
officers who fear they may have been exposed to AIDS or other
communicable diseases.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GUN CONTROL</HEAD>

   Despite a $4 million media blitz by the National Rifle
Association, Maryland voters upheld that state's law banning cheap
handguns known as ``Saturday night specials.''

   Pro-life forces swept to victory in Michigan, Colorado and
Arkansas. The Michigan vote to approve a ban on state-financed
abortions for poor women, except to save the life of the mother, was
58 percent in favor, 42 percent against. Coloradans likewise voted
against state-funded abortions, by 60-40 percent. In Arkansas, an
amendment forbidding state-funded abortion and protecting life
beginning at conception won by 52-48 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TAXES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   South Dakotans rejected property tax-cutting Proposition II by a
63-37 percent margin; Coloradans defeated a ``Taxpayers Bill of
Rights Amendment'' which would have cut income taxes about 10
percent, limited property taxes and required voter approval on
future hikes except in emergencies.
   Utah voters turned down three tax initiatives that together would
have lowered state and local revenues by $329 million. The measures
would have limited property taxes, rolled back income, sales,
gasoline and cigarette taxes, and granted tax credits for private
education.
   On the other side, Arkansas voters defeated a ``Fair Tax
Amendment'' favored by Gov. Bill Clinton that would have made it
easier for the legislature to raise certain taxes. And Nevadans
approved a constitutional prohibition on personal income taxes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SMOKING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Oregon voters defeated a proposed smoking ban extending to nearly
all public places. But Californians gave strong approval to a
25-cent-a-pack hike in the cigarette tax; proceeds will go toward
promoting health.

   Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota and Idaho voters approved state
lotteries. South Dakotans cleared the way for a return to legalized
gambling in the Black Hills town of Deadwood, where Wild Bill Hickok
was shot while playing poker 112 years ago. Town merchants said they
want to raise money to preserve Deadwood's Wild West architecture.

   Florida and Colorado voters overwhelmingly declared English their
state's official tongue. Arizona did likewise, but by a bare 51-49
percent margin.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GAY RIGHTS</HEAD>

   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt was dealt a defeat as voters
overturned his order protecting state workers from discrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation. Fort Collins, Colo., voters turned
down a proposed gay rights ordinance. And St. Paul, Minn., voters
defeated a measure that would have barred them from overturning
city-council-approved gay rights legislation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NUCLEAR POWER</HEAD>

   An initiative that would have forced the shutdown of
Massachusetts' two nuclear power plants was trounced by voters.
Nebraska voters defeated a measure that would have made that state
the first to withdraw from an interstate nuclear waste compact.

   New Yorkers endorsed a record $3 billion borrowing to shore up
aging roads and bridges.

   Massachusetts voters soundly rejected an initiative aimed at
protecting farm animals from cruelty; farmers had opposed it as too
costly. South Dakotans approved a ban on corporate hog farming by a
60-40 percent margin.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SAFETY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Montanans upheld the state's year-old seat belt law, but Oregon
voters rejected a new seat belt ordinance.
   Californians approved restoration of funds for the state's
Occupational Safety and Health Agency, which was dismantled last
year by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Washington state voters chose a toxic waste initiative imposing
tough sanctions on polluters over a tamer rival measure backed by
business and state leaders.
   Montanans rejected a measure that would have made the state the
10th to enact a ``bottle bill'' requiring return deposits on
beverage containers.
   A South Dakota measure requiring strip miners to restore land to
original contours where possible defeated by a 59-41 percent margin.
But Kentucky residents strongly endorsed a measure restricting
strip-mining rights.

   Cambridge, Mass., approved a referendum supporting Palestinian
rights and demanding Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, but another college town, Berkeley, Calif., rejected a

   An Air Force B-52 bomber and a commuter
airplane flew within 150 feet of each other, but authorities said
Wednesday the aircraft were not in danger of colliding.
   ``My heart rate's still up,'' said Terence Brown, a passenger on
Northwest Airlink Flight 2753.
   The incident occurred at 3:20 p.m. Tuesday, about 10 minutes
before the commuter plane was to land at the Marquette County
Airport on a flight from Detroit.
   The B-52 was stationed at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base about 15
miles southeast of the airport, said Sgt. Anita Bailey, a Sawyer
spokeswoman.
   ``Both aircraft were under air traffic control radar and ... both
pilots saw each other visually,'' she said.
   Officials with Simmons Airlines, which operates commuter flights
under contract with Northwest Airlines, did not believe the planes
came close enough to warrant a report, Bailey said, adding that the
Air Force didn't either.

   The PLO said Wednesday it has requested a
U.S. visa for chairman Yasser Arafat so he can address the General
Assembly after his organization decides whether to declare an
independent Palestinian state.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said in a letter made public
Wednesday that Arafat is not welcome in the United States. A
spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission indicated, however, that Arafat and
two other officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization were
likely to be granted limited visas for U.N. business.
   ``We do have an obligation to grant a visa to Arafat under the
(U.S.-U.N) Headquarters Agreement,'' said the spokeswoman, Anne
Stoddard. She said visas also had been requested for two other PLO
officials, who were not immediately identified.
   Under the Headquarters Agreement, the United States agrees not to
obstruct transit of people invited to the United Nations on official
business but reserves the right to deny visas to people it considers
security threats.
   Washington views the PLO as a terrorist organization and has no
direct relations with it.
   Arafat has a standing invitation to address the National Press
Club in Washington. A State Department official indicated that,
while the United States may grant Arafat a limited visa confining
him to New York City, a visit to Washington ``is something else.''
   The official Kuwaiti News Agency quoted unidentified sources
Wednesday as saying Arafat wants to address the General Assembly
Nov. 30 to declare formation of a separate Palestinian state. The
Palestine National Council meets in Algiers this weekend to consider
such a move.
   Riyad H. Mansour, the PLO's deputy permanent observer at the
U.N., said Wednesday of the upcoming meeting in Algiers: ``There is
a very good chance that in this emergency session, independence will
be announced, the birth of an independent Palestinian state.
   ``As a result ... it is very possible that Chairman Arafat will
come to the U.N. to announce this decision and to seek additional
support for this state at an international level,'' Mansour said.
   He predicted Arafat might arrive at the United Nations around
Nov. 22 or 23.
   U.S. legislation, overruled in a federal court, sought earlier
this year to expel the PLO and close its U.N. observer mission.
Arafat last visited the United Nations in 1974 when he received
head-of-state treatment.
   But Shultz, in a Nov. 1 letter to 51 senators who oppose a visa
for Arafat, said: ``I have no desire whatever to see Arafat in the
United States... Should we receive such an application, ... I will
apply severe scrutiny to it.''
   The letter was addressed to Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
released by the U.S. Mission.
   The PLO's alternate permanent U.N. observer, M. Nasser Kidwa,
said he hoped the United States would not deny Arafat the visa
``because such a visit would be ... an attempt towards peace in the
region.''
   U.S. officials and U.N. diplomats said the outcome of the
Palestine National Council meeting this weekend will effect Arafat's
visa application.
   They said a council decision to renounce terrorism and recognize
Israel's right to exist could improve his chances.
   Before adjourning in December, the General Assembly will consider
the Middle East situation and the Palestinian problem, as it does
every year.

   Former attorney general John N. Mitchell, who
authorized the Watergate break-in and then went to prison for
conspiring to cover up the burglary, died Wednesday evening of a
heart attack. He was 75.
   Mitchell collapsed on a sidewalk in Georgetown and died at 6:27
p.m., said Claudia Dominitz, a spokeswoman for George Washington
University Hospital.
   An ambulance crew, alerted by a 10-year-old boy who was
skateboarding, found Mitchell unconscious, but breathing. He stopped
breathing as he was being taken to the hospital, and died despite
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   ``I was coming back from getting my skateboard, and I saw him
walking. ... I just heard this fall, this big `boom,''' said
Octavius Prince, who lives near where Mitchell fell. ``I started
pounding on my door and my mom got mad at me, but I just ran to the
phone and called the paramedics.''
   Mitchell, the first former attorney general to be convicted of a
crime, served a 19-month prison term for his role in the Watergate
cover-up. He was convicted along with Nixon's chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman and the president's domestic counselor, John D. Ehrlichman,
who also served 1{ years in prison.
   The beefy Mitchell, who was known for his credo that ``when the
going gets tough, the tough get going,'' was Nixon's closest
adviser. He was Nixon's law partner and mentor, then ran his 1968
and 1972 election campaigns.
   Nixon, who was a year older, looked up to Mitchell as a father
figure. And yet, when the heat of Watergate made it obvious in March
1973 that the cover-up would unravel, Nixon appeared ready to allow
Mitchell to be the scapegoat.
   G. Gordon Liddy, who conceived the plan that involved
burglarizing the Watergate office building headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee, twice presented the scheme to
Mitchell and maintained that the attorney general approved it.
Mitchell always denied giving the authorization.
   The former attorney general's wife, the flamboyant and peppery
Martha Mitchell, gained a measure of fame for her late-night
telephone calls to reporters in which she offered shrill,
shoot-from-the-hip opinions on controversial issues of all sorts,
including her husband's problems.
   After he was sentenced for conspiracy, Mitchell remarked
bitterly, ``It could have been a hell of a lot worse. They could
have sentenced me to spend the rest of my life with Martha
Mitchell.''
   Mrs. Mitchell died alone in a New York City hospital on May 31,
1976. She had cancer of the bone marrow. The two were estranged and
had lived apart since 1973.
   Mitchell was indicted March 1, 1974 and was convicted of one
count of conspiracy, obstruction of justice, two counts false
statements to a grand jury and one count of perjury. He began a
2{-to-8-year term at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama on June 22,
1977.
   From the White House, President Reagan and his wife Nancy issued
a statement that said they ``are deeply saddened by the news of John
Mitchell's death and extend their sympathies and prayers to his
family.''
   Elliot Richardson, the former Nixon attorney general who resigned
during the Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973 rather than carry
out Nixon's order to fire special Watergate prosecutor Archibald
Cox, described Mitchell as a ``staunch civil rights advocate'' and
said he liked him.
   ``While I've not seen him through the years, I think he deserves
to be remembered for some of the good things he achieved and that's
the way I will remember him,'' Richardson said in an interview from
his home in McLean, Va.
   Jeb Stuart Magruder, a Nixon re-election committee official who
served eight months in prison in connection with Watergate crimes,
recalled Mitchell on Wednesday evening as ``a great mentor and
friend of mine and I just loved that man.'' Magruder is now a
minister at the First Community Church in Columbus, Ohio.
   James F. Neal, the chief trial counsel in the Watergate case,
recalled Mitchell as ``an easy man to know and associate with.''
   ``He committed offenses, and I prosecuted him,'' said Neal in an
interview in Nashville, Tenn., but he added that, ``John Mitchell
and I got along very pleasantly during that time. ... There never
was any bitterness.''
   Mitchell was the oldest and last of the 25 Watergate defendants
to go to prison, and he spent 19 months in the federal prison in
Alabama. Of those 19 months, five were spent on medical furlough for
two operations _ one to replace a section of abdominal artery and
the other to have a plastic hip socket inserted.
   He was released from prison in January 1979.
   Mitchell, formerly a leading municipal bond specialist and senior
partner in Nixon's old Manhattan law firm, was chairman of Nixon's
election campaign in 1968. He resigned as attorney general to run
Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972, but quit that post as the
Watergate scandal began unfolding.
   After his release from prison, he was disbarred and unable to
practice law.
   Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate
case by a federal grand jury investigating the scandal. Soon after
Nixon resigned the presidency in August 1974, his successor, Gerald
R. Ford, pardoned Nixon for any crimes he may have committed in
office.
   Mitchell and Nixon remained good friends throughout the scandal
and afterward. Mitchell never uttered a harsh word about Nixon and
never permitted his defense lawyers to do so during the lengthy
investigation and his own trial.
   Retired Marine Corps Col. John `Jack' Brennan, who was Nixon's
staff director in San Clemente, Calif., after Nixon resigned the
presidency, said late Wednesday that he and Mitchell were business
partners in an international consulting firm, Global Research
International Inc.
   Mitchell was walking from the office to his home when he died,
Brennan said.
   ``He has been, even at my age, my inspiration and has taught me
how to forgive, how to be caring and how to not hold grudges,'' said
Brennan, 51. ``... I never heard him be really cross about any of
the things that happened to him or any of the people who had hurt
him, intentionally or not.''
   The late Sen. Sam Ervin, D-N.C., who presided at the
congressional Watergate hearings, once said, ``I really feel sorry
for John Mitchell. He was very loyal to the president and the
president was very loyal to him.''
   Mitchell and Maurice Stans, a former secretary of commerce who
was the Nixon re-election committee's 1972 finance chairman, were
acquitted in 1974 in a trial in New York of conspiracy and
obstruction of justice charges relating to a campaign contribution
made by fugitive financier Robert Vesco.
   Mitchell's release from prison in January 1979 was widely
described as the final page in the long Watergate saga.
   Then-Attorney General Griffin Bell declared upon Mitchell's
release that ``Watergate is now a closed issue.''
   Mitchell kept a low profile following his release from prison,
avoiding most interviews and refusing to discuss the scandal with
reporters he had frequently accused of blowing the case out of
proportion.
   As he left the military base where he had been imprisoned,
Mitchell gave a curt goodbye to the press covering the event.
   ``Henceforth, don't call me. I'll call you,'' he said.
   Brennan said Mitchell, whose son John Mitchell Jr. died several
years ago, is survived by two daughters, Jill Reed of Coldspring
Harbor, New York, and Marti Mitchell of Washington. He also is
survived by five grandchildren: John M. Mitchell Jr., James
Mitchell, Joseph Mitchell, John Reed and Corp Reed.
   Funeral plans were incomplete late Wednesday, but the funeral
will be held Saturday in Washington, Brennan said.

<HEAD>Bush Lacks Realistic Plan For Cutting Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is coming off Tuesday's convincing
victory with a promise to slay the budget deficit dragon, but the
lance under his arm is made of overcooked fettuccine.
   Bush's ``flexible freeze'' plan for reducing the deficit was soft
even by standards of a political campaign. Now that he has been
elected and reality is setting in, it looks downright pasta-like.
   Economists of all political stripes agree that to make a serious
dent in the budget deficit, Bush will have to cut spending more
severely than anticipated, raise taxes, or both.
   The point here is not to heap criticism on the president-elect.
Michael Dukakis did not propose a detailed, workable deficit
reduction plan, either.
   The real point is that Bush _ and Dukakis as well _ knew
throughout the campaign that to present a realistic plan for
balancing the budget was to commit political hara-kiri.
   When a candidate talks too much about belt-tightening and
trade-offs, voters just say no.
   That's the old news, though. The question for the next four years
is: Will Bush have the political strength to shave the deficit when
he has neither asked for, nor received a mandate to make hard
choices on spending and taxation?
   Maybe. The most likely outcome, though, is that Bush will stick
with his flexible freeze; it will not work; and the federal
government will continue to run massive budget deficits.
   What's wrong with that? In some ways, not much. The stimulation
of excess government spending is one of the factors that has kept
the momentum behind President Reagan's record 6-year-long economic
expansion.
   Unfortunately, deficit spending means borrowing. Since there
aren't enough private savings in this country, the United States
must borrow from overseas to cover the gap. That means future
generations are falling into debt to foreign nations.
   The United States became a ``net debtor'' during the Reagan
administration for the first time since World War I, and the
situation is getting worse.
   Which brings us back to the flexible freeze. The freeze,
economists say, is based on such unrealistic assumptions that it is
like a golfer asking for a ``gimme'' on a 50-foot putt.
   Bush proposes that by freezing overall outlays, with an allowance
for inflation, he will be able to save $55 billion to $60 billion by
1993.
   The plan exempts mandatory payments of interest, as it must. It
also cautiously keeps its hands off Social Security payments, which
would grow according to current law. Defense spending would rise at
the rate of inflation.
   Those conditions mean the remainder of the budget _ the 40
percent that represents everything from education to Medicare to
national parks _ would have to absorb budget increases of less than
the rate of inflation.
   Faced with a Democratic House and Senate, Bush is likely to have
a hard time achieving the cuts he promises in those areas.
   But here is where the plan really falls down: It assumes an
unlikely combination of real economic growth of more than 3 percent
through 1993, and a gradual decline in the inflation rate to just
above 2 percent.
   According to this wishful scenario, the strong growth would
produce more tax revenue, while the low inflation would reduce the
government's interest expenses. The economic expansion, already a
record 6 years old, would reach its 11th birthday without a
recession.
   In reality, strong growth tends to produce higher inflation, not
lower. Even if Bush manages to get the vigorous growth he wants _
itself unlikely _ he almost certainly will not get the low inflation
and interest rates he predicts.
   ``The flexible freeze program is neither credible nor workable,''
Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., concluded in a
recent paper.
   The federal budget deficit is undoubtedly the most difficult
economic problem Bush will face, requiring tough and unpopular
political choices. Judging from the campaign, it is not clear that
Bush is prepared to make them.

<HEAD>Producer-Director Dan Curtis: 9 Years on `Winds-Remembrance of War'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not over yet for producer-director Dan
Curtis, and despite nine years spent on the ABC miniseries ``The
Winds of War'' and its sequel, ``War and Remembrance,'' he's not
ready to give it up.
   The first half of ``War and Remembrance'' begins Sunday. He
hasn't even started editing the second half, which probably won't
air until May. In all, the miniseries is expected to run 30 hours.
   ``I'm lucky this time,'' said Curtis. ``With `Winds of War' it
went on the air, and then it became yesterday's news. If you miss
it, that's it. It's not like a movie in a theater that keeps
running. But this time the other part's still coming.''
   Curtis spent more time re-creating World War II in the two
miniseries than the six years the real war lasted, 1939-45. ``The
Winds of War'' ran in 1983 at 18 hours and cost $40 million. ``War
and Remembrance'' cost $110 million, making it not only the longest
but the most expensive film project ever.
   The first 18 hours of ``War and Remembrance'' will be aired in
seven parts over a span of 11 nights.
   ``I don't like skipping all those days, but there's nothing I can
do about it,'' said Curtis. ``I understand ABC's problem, but I
still don't like it. I'd rather see it run every night. I've cut it
after 18 hours at the only possible breaking point. Any other break
would be a disaster.
   ``The long break between the first and second parts bothers me.
ABC would like it earlier and I'd love to give it to them. But
there's no way to get it ready before May.''
   A big ``if'' is the ratings. ``The Winds of War'' got a 38.6
rating and 53 share, making it the third highest-rated miniseries
after ``Roots'' and ``The Thorn Birds.'' Although the television
audience has grown in the past five years, the networks' share of
the audience has shrunk due to increased competition from cable,
independent stations and videocassettes.
   ``I think people will stick with it,'' Curtis said. ``Each show
seems to get better than the one that precedes it. When I shoot, the
look is almost more important than the dialogue, or equally
important. You focus on the reaction of people to what's being said.
Television gives it an intimacy.
   ``Most people don't know the difference between good shooting and
bad shooting. In fact, most directors don't understand it either.
But if you shoot it the right way and your camera angles are right,
it will heighten it because you're telling the story visually. I
think with `War and Remembrance' people will actually feel they're
inside the picture rather than just being an outside observer.''
   The two miniseries, adapted from Wouk's two novels, follow naval
officer Pug Henry (Robert Mitchum) and show how the war affects him,
his wife, daughter, two sons and other members of the family.
   Pug participates in the Battle of Midway. His son Byron (Hart
Bochner) is a submarine commander in the Pacific. Byron's Jewish
wife, Natalie (Jane Seymour), is trapped in Europe with their child
and her uncle, author Aaron Jastrow (Sir John Gielgud).
   The sea battles look authentic. When Natalie and her uncle
finally end up at Auschwitz, Curtis filmed at the former Nazi death
camp and many of the extras were survivors of the Holocaust. In one
scene, Reichsfuehrer-SS Heinrich Himmler visits Auschwitz to watch a
demonstration of a new method to kill large numbers of Jews.
   ``I told the extras I didn't know how they would react,'' Curtis
said. ```You probably don't expect to die, but you know
subconsciously something is going to happen.' What a tough thing to
put them through. The people began to cling to each other. I was
destroyed by what I was watching. When they came running out with no
clothes on it was so real.
   ``You can sense what it must have been like. If the audience can
feel that then I will have accomplished what I set out to
accomplish. If we can do that it will all have been worth it.''

<HEAD>Seeking A Credit Card Should Be Like Shopping For A Car</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine this: A restaurant trying to solicit
business mails you a sample menu that leaves out prices and doesn't
describe its dishes.
   Or, how about a car dealership pitching its latest model that
keeps the sticker price inside the trunk instead of on the side
windows?
   Would either establishment be likely to get your business? Hardly.
   Yet many American consumers have had credit cards issued to them
over the years without knowing beforehand all the exact terms, such
as the interest rates, fees or grace periods involved.
   Last week, President Reagan signed long-awaited legislation that
changes all that. The new law, which goes into effect early next
year, forces all banks, department stores and other credit card
issuers to supply these details on applications and solicitations.
   Under current law, creditors are not required to disclose the
information until the card is issued.
   ``Now the sticker is on the window instead of hidden in the
trunk, so to speak,'' noted Robert K. Heady, publisher of the North
Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter 100 Highest Yields, which tracks the
credit card industry. ``But if the buyer shops around he can find a
cheaper model.''
   That's good news for the more than 100 million U.S. consumers who
hold more than 800 million credit cards and have outstanding
balances approaching $150 billion.
   Consumer groups had strongly backed the standard-setting
legislation because it would allow people to shop for the best
deals. And banking groups liked the fact that the measure would
prevent states from imposing differing disclosure requirements on
their interstate industry.
   From a consumer standpoint, ``The main reason why we needed the
disclosure law was because the whole credit-card industry since the
early 1980s ... has taken a very sophisticated marketing approach,''
said Peggy Miller, a lobbyist with the Consumer Federation of
America.
   She said that while computers have made it easier for creditors
to solicit business through the mail, the nitty-gritty financial
terms have remained ``too complicated and easily misinterpreted''
for the average person.
   Ms. Miller cited a poll conducted by credit card giant MasterCard
International four years ago. It found, among other things, that of
373 cardholders surveyed nationwide, only 27 percent were aware they
had an annual fee and a scant 17 percent knew the rate of interest
they were paying.
   Consumer groups say more legislation is needed to give
plastic-happy consumers a fairer shake in the expanding credit
world, particularly in the area of interest rates, which have
remained historically high.
   ``We're pushing for an outright (rate) cap tied to the prime
rate,'' said Ms. Miller.
   Heady said 100 Highest Yield's latest weekly survey of the
nation's 100 largest banks and thrifts found the average rate on
cards such as MasterCard or Visa was 18.19 percent, compared with an
average 18.81 percent three years ago. The prime now stands at 10
percent.
   Financial institutions have defended their rates as necessary to
cover high operating costs and fraud.
   But Heady said there's a possibility the new disclosure law might
make credit card rates more competitive, especially if banks and
thrifts now have to advertise them.
   100 Highest Yield's latest survey of large institutions found
Glendale Federal Savings and Loan in Glendale, Calif., had the
highest rate of 20.90 percent last week, while Dime Savings Bank in
New York had the lowest, 14.9 percent.
   Better deals can be struck at some smaller institutions,
depending on individual needs. Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks all
conventional credit card rates nationwide, found that as of early
November, Arkansas Federal Savings Bank in Little Rock, Ark.,
offered the overall lowest rate, 10.9 percent.
   Among the others: People's Bank in Bridgeport, Conn., 12.5
percent; Home Plan Savings and Loan in Des Moines, Iowa, 12.9
percent; Republic Savings and Loan in Milwaukee, 13.68 percent; and
Middletown Savings Bank in New York and Empire of America in
Buffalo, N.Y., both 13.75 percent.
   The annual fees at those institutions ranged from $10 to $35, and
the grace periods before they started charging interest ranged from
no days to 25 days following the date of billing. Some banks and
thrifts, along with private credit card giant American Express,
extend grace periods to 30 days.
   Consumers who tend to carry over their balances should shop for
the lowest rates, while those who pay them off at the end of the
month are better off seeking institutions offering no or low annual
fees. Amalgamated Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago had the best
deal as of Nov. 1, offering no annual fee and a 14.5 percent rate,
according to the latest Bank Rate Monitor poll.
   A handful of other institutions _ such as Imperial Savings in San
Diego, and Security Bank and Trust in Southgate, Mich. _ also waived
annual fees, although their interest rates were significantly
higher, the survey found.

   The dollar and stock prices moved lower in Europe
on Wednesday as the financial markets digested George Bush's victory
in the U.S. presidential election.
   Dealers had expected the financial markets to jump slightly out
of relief following confirmation of Bush's victory, but the
``honeymoon'' with the new president, instead of lasting for the
expected few days, was over in about an hour, dealers said.
   The dollar leaped starting at about 1 a.m. GMT Wednesday, as
Bush's victory became clear, but then at about 2 a.m., it dropped
sharply on profit-taking, said David Simmonds, treasury economist at
Midland Bank, whose trading room was one of several in London which
stayed open all night.
   The markets were concerned about a lack of indication from Bush
during the election campaign about what he intends to do about the
U.S. budget and trade deficits, dealers said.
   ``Bush faces big problems with the budget and trade deficit,
which a popular Reagan could avoid addressing,'' a Milan-based
trader said.
   If the dollar continues to weaken on such worries, U.S. interest
rates could have to move higher to prop up the currency, and that
would depress stock prices, they said.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Italy said the dollar was depressed
because dealers believed Bush's narrower-than-expected victory
underlined what they saw as voters' lack of enthusiasm for the new
president.
   However, Bush was expected to bring continued economic prosperity
to the United States and a victory by his challenger, Michael
Dukakis, would have been more bearish for the markets, dealers have
said.
   Equities dealers in London said Bush's win had already been
discounted by the market on Tuesday, when shares rallied strongly on
London's Stock Exchange.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index fell 16.7
points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,823.9 by late morning Wednesday after
rising 20.9 points on Tuesday.
   The dollar fell sharply against the British pound. In London, the
pound was quoted at $1.7818, compared with $1.7707 Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, the dollar fell to 1.7752 West German marks from
1.7990 and to 1.4930 Swiss francs from 1.5005.
   Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange opened lower in nervous
trading. In the first 10 minutes, the German Stock Index dipped 4.08
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,287.88.
   In Paris, the general stock market indicator was unchanged at
midday, when advancing issues were ahead of declines 89 to 77 and 14
stocks were unchanged.
   And in earlier stock trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose
205.51 points, or 0.7 percent, to 28,212.78 as news of Bush's early
lead in the U.S. presidential election was reported. The dollar fell
0.08 yen to close at 124.65 yen.
   Buying was encouraged by many market players' expectations that a
victory for Bush would bring no major change in U.S. economic
policy, said a dealer at a major securities firm.
   The markets are still undecided whether the Bush's ascent to the
presidency ultimately will result in a stronger or a weaker dollar,
traders in Frankfurt said. But many think there will be little
change in the U.S. currency until Bush takes over in January.
   ``It looks like the dollar is bound to stick to its recent ranges
during the transition period between the two administrations,'' said
a dealer at a major West German bank.

   Technical factors continued to dominate the oil
futures market, where prices retreated in thin, choppy trading in
advance of upcoming OPEC meetings.
   Analysts said traders Tuesday were awaiting the Nov. 17 price
committee meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and the Nov. 21 gathering of the full cartel.
   Cutting production is expected to be discussed at both meetings
as a way of increasing soft worldwide oil prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed down 26
cents Tuesday to $13.80 a barrel, after rising 2 cents on Monday.
Other contract months declined.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Tuesday,
unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.91 cent in the previous session,
fell 0.85 cent to 46.40 cents.
   The December contract for whoesale home heating oil lost 0.60
cent to settle at 45.53 cents a gallon. The contract was up 0.05
cent on Monday.

   Stock prices dropped sharply Wednesday on
skepticism over President-elect George Bush's ability to handle the
U.S. economy and worries over the weakness of the dollar.
   The decline wiped out the gains from Tuesday's pre-election
rally, but dealers said they did not expect the market to weaken
much further.
   ``Unless you think Wall Street is going to come in and take quite
a bath, there isn't any reason to suspect the market's going to come
off further,'' said a trader for a major British brokerage firm.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was down 17.5
points, or 1.0 percent, to 1,823.1 in mid-afternoon after rising
20.9 points on Tuesday.
   Volume was 331.2 million shares at midday, up from 288.3 million
shares at the same time a day earlier.
   Wall Street's drop from its best levels on Tuesday helped depress
prices of British equities, while the apparent negative reaction by
the dollar also cast a pall over the market, dealers said
   In New York Tuesday, before the election results were known, the
Dow Jones industrial average closed up 2.85 points at 2,127.49,
after being up by about 16 points earlier in the day.
   Of concern to the British market was a lack of indication from
Bush during the election campaign what he steps he would take to
redue the U.S. budget and trade deficits, dealers said.

   Stock prices were broadly lower in early trading
today as the market began to assess the future under a George Bush
administration.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 5.87 points at
2,121.62 after a half hour of trading at 10 a.m. EST.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 5 to 2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 632 issues down, 251 up and 440 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 21.51 million shares.
   U.S. stocks also were lower in many major overseas markets,
including London and Frankfurt.
   Analysts said the stock market had put the election behind and
turned its attention back to the economy.
   ``The election deflected attention from the real world. Now the
real world is back,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The budget deficit is still
there. The same questions remain about interest rates. Will the Fed
make a move now?''
   Analysts said a weaker dollar also weighed heavily on this
morning's stock prices.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.82 at
154.02. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market index
was down 0.83 to 293.93. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial
average advanced 2.85 points to close at 2,127.49, near its low of
the day. The blue-chip indicator had gained more than 14 points in
early trading.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced declining issues
by about 3-to-2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 852 issues up, 578 down and 532
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE totaled 141.66 million shares, up
from 133.87 million in Monday's session.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.29
to 294.76.

<NOTE>Eds: Retransmitting to change slug to avoid duplication with

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer virus that appears to be a version of
one created in Pakistan has infected programs used by University of
Houston business students, causing a nuisance but posing no real
danger, officials say.
   The original so-called ``Brain'' computer virus was traced to a
computer store in Lahore, Pakistan.
   ``It probably hasn't cost us much except a few days of
people-time to clean up these disks, but it probably cost the
students a good bit of frustration,'' said Michael Walters, director
of research and instructional computing services at the university's
main campus.
   Some students have reported losing data, but Walters said he
knows of no one who has lost an entire term paper or other large
quantity of work. Reports of the virus were still coming in from
students late Tuesday.
   The virus first announced itself at the university early last
week on the screen of one of the 150 personal computers the business
department has for students and faculty, Walters said. It has not
spread to larger computers at the school, he said.
   A computer virus is a string of coded commands hidden in useful
programs or software. Like a biological virus, it uses its host to
reproduce, replicating itself into other programs used on the same
computer or into computers to which it is connected.
   Since the affected university computers were isolated from each
other and the outside world, the virus' spread was limited, Walters
said. Last week, a sophisticated virus spread along a computer
network used by universities and defense contractors and eventually
affected an estimated 6,000 computers nationwide.
   A virus can do damage in several ways: by keeping a computer so
busy with commands so that its operation becomes sluggish, as
happened with last week's virus; by using up memory; or by erasing
data.
   Walters said the virus at the Houston school flashed this
message, with misspellings, to students who tried to use infected
programs: ``Welcome to the dungeon. Copyright 1968 Brain & Amjads,
PVT, LTD. Virus shoe record V9.0. Dedicated to the dynamic memory of
millions of virus who are no longer with us today _ Thank Goodness.
BEWARE OF THE VIRUS. This program is catching. Program follows after
these messeges.''
   The original ``Brain'' virus appeared in May at colleges and
businesses along the East Coast. It flashed the ``Welcome to the
Dungeon'' message, but added ``Contact us for vaccination,'' and
gave the names, address and phone number of two brothers who run a
computer store in Lahore, Pakistan.
   Walters said the Houston version of the virus says nothing about
any vaccine, and the ``V9.0'' in its message suggests it may be a
modified version.

   Stock prices regained some of their earlier
losses but remained slightly lower in early trading today, pressured
by a weaker dollar in foreign exchange markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.78 points to
2,125.71 at 11 a.m. EST. The Dow had opened lower and was down
nearly 6 points an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 7 to 4 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 706 issues down, 407 up and 552 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 43.7 million shares.
   U.S. stocks also were lower in many major overseas markets,
including London and Frankfurt.
   Analysts said a weaker dollar weighed heavily on this morning's
stock prices. The currency started out softer in foreign exchange
markets overseas then weakened further in U.S. trading after
statements from economist Martin Feldstein, an adviser to George
Bush, that the dollar would have to fall further to help the U.S.
trade deficit.
   Analysts said the stock market had put the election behind and
turned its attention back to the economy.
   ``The election deflected attention from the real world. Now the
real world is back,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The budget deficit is still

   The naming of James Baker to Secretary of State in the new Bush
administration had little immediate impact on the market, traders
said.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.43 at
154.41. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market index
was off 0.49 at 294.27.

   The dollar weakened and stock and bond prices headed lower today
in a cautious reaction to George Bush's decisive victory over
Michael Dukakis in the presidential election.
   Economists said several factors depressed the U.S. currency,
including nervousness overseas over how the president-elect would
deal with crucial problems such as the budget and trade deficits and
with the Democatic-controlled Congress.
   ``I think the markets already thought Bush would win and are
viewing the election as a non-event ... but some uncertainty
remains,'' explained Edward Yardeni, chief economist for Prudential
Bache Securities Inc.
   ``What's depressing the bonds and stocks is that the dollar is
down pretty hard.''
   The dollar initially rallied overseas after Bush's victory
Tuesday. But it later eased in Japan and Europe, largely on
profit-taking, and it was down in early domestic trading despite
reports of central-bank intervention.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down
1.78 to 2,125.71 as of 11 a.m. EST, after losing about 6 points in
the first 30 minutes of trading. The closely watched indicator had
advanced 2.85 points in Election Day trading.
   Interest rates shot up today as bond prices declined. The yield
on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue rose to 9 percent for the
first time in more than a month by late morning, while its price
fell about $7.50 per $1,000 face amount. Short-term rates were up
slightly.
   Stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose
against major foreign currencies on Tuesday, partly because of
confidence that Republican Bush would defeat Democrat Dukakis, and
that the victory would mean continuation of the Reagan
administration's economic policies.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in light, cautious trading ahead
of this afternoon's crop production report from the Agriculture
Department.
   Most market analysts expected the government to slightly increase
its estimates for the drought-shriveled 1988 U.S. corn and soybean
crops based on conditions as of Nov. 1.
   In last month's crop production report, the USDA projected a corn
harvest of 4.55 billion bushels, down 35 percent from last year, and
a soybean harvest of 1.5 billion bushels, 21 percent below last
year's level.
   The USDA is expected to increase each of those those estimates by
about 10 million bushels, according to one published survey of 25
analysts.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.23} a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.77{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent lower with December at $2.22\ a bushel; and
soybeans were 2{ cents to 5\ cents lower with November at $7.91 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower and pork futures were sharply lower in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The pork market
was pressured by the Merc's weekly cold-storage report, which showed
a sharp increase in the supply of frozen pork bellies in out-of-town
freezers last week, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .62 cent lower with December at
73.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .60 cent lower
with November at 81.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .32 cent to .90
cent lower with December at 41.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .47 cent to 1.25 cents lower with February at 44.90 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

   Stock prices fell in early trading today,
pressured by a weaker dollar in foreign exchange markets and
uncertainty about the economy under a new administration.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 9.60 points to
2,117.89 at noon EST. The Dow had started lower and seesawed during
morning trading. An hour earlier the blue-chip indicator was down
1.78 points.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 11 to 5 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 855 issues down, 373 up and 551 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 77.2 million shares.
   Analysts said stock prices were influenced by a weakening dollar,
which also pulled down bond prices. After starting out weak, the
currency declined further after remarks by economist Martin
Feldstein, an adviser to George Bush, that the dollar would have to
fall further to extend the economic recovery and help the U.S. trade
deficit.
   Analysts said the dollar's weakness stemmed partly from concerns
about George Bush's ability to deal with important economic matters
like spending and the twin deficits.
   Meanwhile, observers said the stock market had put the election
behind and turned its attention back to the economy.
   ``The election deflected attention from the real world. Now the

<TEXT>
   A former top economic advisor to President
Reagan warned president-elect George Bush Wednesday against the
danger of a trade war between the United States and Western Europe
which could spill over into the Far East.
   Martin Feldstein, former head of Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisors, also called for a drop of at least 20 percent in the value
of the dollar over the next three years, to help reduce the U.S.
trade deficit.
   The dollar should be worth 100 Japanese yen or less instead of
the current 125 yen, he said.
   A cheaper dollar makes U.S. exports more attractive in foreign
markets.
   Feldstein, now a professor at Harvard University, was speaking to
a conference of international investors sponsored by the American
Stock Exchange.
   He attacked the new trade bill signed by Reagan, calling it a
``terrible bill.''
   ``It's no exaggeration to say that any American company with a
trade problem can now start a case against any country in the
world,'' Feldstein said.
   He also warned against future efforts to protect trade among the
12 countries of the European Economic Community, which plans to
abolish remaining trade barriers within the group by 1992.
   If more competitive U.S. exports are combined with irritating
litigation in the United States to restrict imports, the Europeans
will turn to their own markets and try to exclude other countries
from them, Feldstein predicted. He said the result would be a trade
war between the United States and Europe that could spread to the
Pacific.
   A reduced U.S. trade deficit would help avoid that problem,
Feldstein said.

   F.W. Woolworth Co. reported Wednesday its
third-quarter income rose 22 percent as the retailer's revenue
increased 12 percent.
   The company said it earned $66 million, or $1.02 per share, in
the quarter ended Oct. 29, up from $54 million, or 82 cents per
share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Revenue increased to $1.97 billion from $1.77 billion.
   Woolworth said its third-quarter results were aided by a $4
million benefit from lower taxes.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Woolworth said it
earned $144 million, or $2.24 per share, up 20 percent from $120
million, or $1.81 per share, in the same period of 1987.
   Revenue for the first three quarters increased 12.1 percent to
$5.54 billion from $4.94 billion.
   The company owns Woolworth, Kinney shoe, Foot Locker and other
stores.

   Share prices fell in moderate trading Wednesday on
the London Stock Exchange amid skepticism over President-elect
George Bush's ability to handle the U.S. economy and worries over
the weakness of the dollar.
   Initial enthusiasm for the Republican victory disappeared with
dealers suggesting that Bush had offered few concrete suggestions
for dealing with the huge budget and trade deficits and that he
would have to contend with a Democrat-controlled Congress.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 14.9
points to 1,825.7. Shortly after the start of trading, the index hit
its high for the day of 1,832.0 and later sank as low as 1,820.1.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed down 11.2
points at 1,479.8.
   The Financial Times 500-share index finished at 1,040.58, down
7.51.
   Volume was 517.5 million shares, compared with the 507.9 million
shares traded Tuesday. However, several dealers said a large
computer-generated sell program accounted for a substantial portion
of the volume.

fall further to extend the economic recovery and help the U.S. trade
deficit.
   Observers said the market's weakness also stemmed from investor
concerns about George Bush's ability to deal with important economic
issues like spending and the twin deficits and to work with a
Democratically-controlled Congress.
   ``The market is back to thinking about fundamental questions
about the economy,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``The big question is how is he
going to handle the federal budget deficit particularly since he
painted himself into a corner by saying there wouldn't be any tax
increases?''

   The dollar and stock prices moved lower in Europe
on Wednesday as the financial markets digested George Bush's victory
in the U.S. presidential election.
   Dealers had expected the financial markets to jump slightly out
of relief following confirmation of Bush's victory, but the
``honeymoon'' with the new president, instead of lasting for the
expected few days, was over in about an hour, dealers said.
   The dollar leaped starting at about 1 a.m. GMT Wednesday, as
Bush's victory became clear, but then at about 2 a.m., it dropped
sharply on profit-taking, said David Simmonds, treasury economist at
Midland Bank, whose trading room was one of several in London which
stayed open all night.
   The markets were concerned about a lack of indication from Bush
during the election campaign about what he intends to do about the
U.S. budget and trade deficits, dealers said.
   ``Bush faces big problems with the budget and trade deficit,
which a popular Reagan could avoid addressing,'' a Milan-based
trader said.
   If the dollar continues to weaken on such worries, U.S. interest
rates could have to move higher to prop up the currency, and that
would depress stock prices, they said.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Italy said the dollar was depressed
because dealers believed Bush's narrower-than-expected victory
underlined what they saw as voters' lack of enthusiasm for the new
president.
   However, Bush was expected to bring continued economic prosperity
to the United States and a victory by his challenger, Michael
Dukakis, would have been more bearish for the markets, dealers have
said.
   Equities dealers in London said Bush's win had already been
discounted by the market on Tuesday, when shares rallied strongly on
London's Stock Exchange.
   On Wednesday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell 14.9 points to close at 1,825.7. Shortly after the start of
trading, the index hit its high for the day of 1,832.0 and later
sank as low as 1,820.1.
   The dollar fell sharply against the British pound. In London, the
British pound rose to $1.7890 from $1.7707 late Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, the dollar fell to 1.7665 West German marks from
1.7990 marks and to 1.4865 Swiss francs from 1.5005.
   Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange opened lower in nervous
trading. In the first 10 minutes, the German Stock Index dipped 4.08
points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,287.88.
   In Paris, the general stock market indicator was unchanged at
midday, when advancing issues were ahead of declines 89 to 77 and 14
stocks were unchanged.
   And in earlier stock trading in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose
205.51 points, or 0.7 percent, to 28,212.78 as news of Bush's early
lead in the U.S. presidential election was reported. The dollar fell
0.08 yen to close at 124.65 yen.
   Buying was encouraged by many market players' expectations that a
victory for Bush would bring no major change in U.S. economic
policy, said a dealer at a major securities firm.
   The markets are still undecided whether the Bush's ascent to the
presidency ultimately will result in a stronger or a weaker dollar,
traders in Frankfurt said. But many think there will be little
change in the U.S. currency until Bush takes over in January.
   ``It looks like the dollar is bound to stick to its recent ranges
during the transition period between the two administrations,'' said
a dealer at a major West German bank.

<HEAD>Kodak Says Checks for Instant Cameras in the Mail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The check is in the mail.
   In fact, 3.48 million of them have been mailed in the last few
days by the Eastman Kodak Co., which is trying to wind up the
court-approved settlement with owners of Kodak instant cameras.
   Kodak agreed to pay more than $106 million in cash and $89
million in certificates for rebates on purchases of Kodak products.
   Almost everyone's check should arrive by the end of the week,
Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said Tuesday.
   The minimum payout on such basic models as the Handle (it had a
crank to advance the film) is $50 _ a check for $19.50 and three
certificates totaling $30.50 in rebates. The maximum is $70 for
top-of-the-line models _ $52 in cash and $18 in rebates.
   The certificates are valid through 1989, so total cost of the
settlement to Kodak won't be known until sometime in 1990, Allen
said. The company has estimated that the whole package will cost
close to $150 million.
   Still unresolved is compensation of the lawyers who handled the
class-action suit against Kodak on behalf of the camera owners. The
court-approved settlement allowed $6 million but required the
lawyers to submit claims and supporting documents.
   The whole case is an expensive offshoot of the suit Polaroid
Corp. filed against Kodak in April 1976 when Kodak introduced its
own instant cameras and film. Polaroid said Kodak infringed on its
patents.
   After losing several rounds in courts, Kodak withdrew from
instant photography in January 1986.

   Stock prices declined sharply in afternoon
trading today, pressured by a weaker dollar and uncertainty about
the economy under a new administration.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 11.38 points to
2,116.11 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was down more than
20 points 30 minutes earlier.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by about 7 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,018 issues down, 434 up and 470
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 128.94 million shares.
   Analysts said that although a number of factors contributed to
the weakness in today's market, the overriding push stemmed from
investor worries about George Bush's ability to deal with important
economic issues and to work with a Democratically-controlled
Congress.
   ``The market is back to thinking about fundamental questions
about the economy,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``The big question is how is he
going to handle the federal budget deficit particularly since he
painted himself into a corner by saying there wouldn't be any tax
increases?''
   Also weighing heavily on the market was the lower dollar, which
pulled down bond prices as the declining currency invited
intervention by the Federal Reserve. The currency continued to fall
despite the intervention.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.10 at
153.74. At the American Stock Exchange, the composite market index
was off 1.31 at 293.45.
   Interest-sensitive stocks like utilities were close to breaking
new lows, traders said, and insurance company stocks also were weak
on the heels of California's adoption of Proposition 103, which
calls for a reduction in auto insurance premiums.

<HEAD>Europeans Worry About Bush's Ability to Tackle Deficits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's ``honeymoon'' in European financial
circles proved brief Wednesday, as concerns about his ability to
tackle the U.S. twin deficits quickly overshadowed relief at the
election of a Republican president who would carry on the legacy of
Ronald Reagan.
   Foreign officials immediately began to apply pressure on the
newly elected president to reduce the deficits, which are viewed in
Europe as the United States' biggest economic problem and a danger
to economies worldwide.
   Stock prices declined in European markets in reaction to the
election results, and the dollar's value fell against major foreign
currencies after a brief rally Wednesday morning.
   Many Europeans are skeptical that Bush will be able reduce the
deficits because of his pledge to avoid tax increases. They said the
task would be complicated further by the continuation of a
Democratic majority in the American Congress.
   The fact that Bush hasn't outlined any specific plans for
addressing the budget deficit also added to the unease in Europe.
   European economists predicted that the U.S. currency will decline
further and the world's stock markets will remain depressed over the
next three months because of deficit fears.
   Despite the uncertainties, European investors still appeared to
favor Bush over his defeated Democratic challenger, Michael Dukakis.
   ``Certainly there was a sigh of relief that it was Bush,'' said
Keith Skeoch, chief economist at the London investment firm James
Capel and Co.
   ``We believe we will not see a major or dramatic change in the
economic development in the coming months,'' said Peter Pietsch, a
senior economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ``He's against
experiments. Even that alone is a help.''
   What is particularly important to Europe, which exports its
products to the United States, is that Bush has a good record as a
free-trader, the economists said.
   ``He's supposed to be against protectionism and that's important
for the markets,'' Pietsch said.
   But Skeoch added, ``I don't think that you will see the usual
honeymoon period. We appear to have a budget impasse and there
doesn't appear to be any resolution in the cards.''
   In addition, the U.S. trade deficit is expected to remain at its
high levels, Skeoch said.
   The budget and trade deficits curb U.S. economic growth and push
up interests rates, which hurt the world's other economies.
   Although the economists expect the U.S. economy to keep growing,
they said lack of action on the deficits poses grave risks of
precipitating a major world recession.
   The rest of the world's major industrial powers, linked
informally to the United States in the so-called Group of Seven,
will be eager for Bush to make some statement about how he intends
to manage these problems, Skeoch said. The other G-7 nations are
Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Canada and Italy.
   During the campaign, many countries played down their concerns
about the deficits in order to avoid meddling in the U.S.
presidential election, Skeoch said.
   ``I think the kid gloves are coming off,'' he said.
   In Tokyo earlier Wednesday, after Bush's victory, the Bank of
Japan reportedly said it wasn't optimistic about the chances of
narrowing the U.S. budget deficit.
   Also Wednesday, Willy De Clercq, a leading West European trade
official, called on Bush to reduce the deficits to ease
protectionist pressures in Congress.
   On Monday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
warned in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview that he
feared a loss of confidence in the dollar unless the new
administration took ``early steps to get to grips'' with the deficit
problems.
   ``The G-7 cooperation and diplomacy are starting to come away at
the edges,'' Skeoch said.
   The Confederation of British Industry, saying it cautiously
welcomed Bush's victory, expressed concern that the Democratic
control of Capitol Hill would lead to ``a continuation of a conflict
on the key issues like protectionism.''

   Grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in light, cautious trading
ahead of the Agriculture Department's crop production report.
   The report _ released in Washington 45 minutes after the markets
closed _ showed a slight increase in the government's estimates for
the drought-shriveled 1988 U.S. corn and soybean crops.
   The USDA projected a corn harvest of 4.67 billion bushels, down
34 percent from last year, and a soybean harvest of 1.51 billion
bushels, 21 percent below last year's level.
   Those numbers compared with the USDA's October estimates of 4.55
billion bushels of corn and 1.50 billion bushels of soybeans.
   The new corn production estimate was higher than expected while
the soybean number fell within the range of analysts' expectations.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.25\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to } cent higher with December at $2.79 a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.23 a bushel;
soybeans were 1\ cents lower to } cent higher with November at $7.97

   Stock prices closed lower after flipflopping most
of the day, pressured by a weaker dollar and concerns about the
economy under a new administration.
   Some analysts said they were surprised by the selling activity
that erupted at the opening bell. They said the weaker dollar was
only partly to blame.
   ``I guess the market is saying it's worried more about the
economy than about the election,'' said Carter Randall, money
manager for The Randall Co. in Florida.
   Other observers said the bearish sentiment was to be expected as
investors put the election behind them and began to question life
under a George Bush administration.
   ``The market is back to thinking about fundamental questions
about the economy,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G.
Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``The big question is how is he
going to handle the federal budget deficit particularly since he
painted himself into a corner by saying there wouldn't be any tax
increases?''
   The market reversed its slide before midday but continued its
decline in afternoon trading, influenced by the continued slide in
the dollar despite several attempts by the Federal Reserve to
support the currency.
   The dollar weakened further at one point in the day after remarks
by economist Martin Feldstein, a Bush adviser, that the dollar had
to go lower to extend the economic recovery and help the U.S. trade
deficit. The fall in the dollar sent bond prices tumbling.
   ``The bond and dollar have combined to put pressure on the
market,'' Goldman said. ``The softer dollar conjures up fears that
the Fed will have to come in and support the dollar by raising
interest rates.''
   A weaker currency also erodes the value of dollar-denominated
securities.

   Investors on Wednesday gave George Bush a warning
to fix the U.S. trade and budget deficits in a surprisingly cool
post-election reception that battered the dollar and forced stocks
and bonds lower.
   Although a Bush win in the presidential race had been anticipated
and welcomed by the markets, economists said investors grew worried
over how the new Republican president and Democratic-controlled
Congress would work together to trim the deficits, among other
things.
   ``I look at it as basic economic reality vs. political
constraints,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International. ``Bush has said there would be
no tax increase ... so that will mean budget cuts. The impasse will
be over where to cut.''
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped
9.25 to 2,118.24, recovering some lost ground in the final 90
an election that treated incumbents kindly, yet
one that produced its fair share of fresh faces.
   The new senators included Joseph Lieberman in Connecticut, a
Democrat who ended Lowell Weicker's maverick career after three
terms. Former Govs. Charles Robb in Virginia and Robert Kerrey in
Nebraska turned Republican Senate seats into Democratic ones. Gov.
Richard Bryan of Nevada ousted freshman GOP Sen. Chic Hecht in
Nevada.
   Herbert Kohl was elected Wisconsin's new Democratic senator.
   Conrad Burns in Montana was the only Republican to defeat a
Senate Democratic incumbent. He beat John Melcher, seeking a third
term.
   Other newly elected Republicans in the Senate included Rep. Trent
Lott from Mississippi and Rep. James Jeffords from Vermont, both of
whom won open seats. Slade Gorton of Washington, defeated in a
re-election bid two years ago, mounted a successful comeback.
   One Republican, Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, squeaked to a new
term.
   Though a few House incumbents remained locked in tough races on
the afternoon after the election, that didn't change the overall
picture. Incumbency was practically a guarantee of victory.
   The few exceptions to the rule included Rep. Fernand J. St
Germain, a 14-term veteran and chairman of the House Banking
Committee. Beset by charges of ethical lapses, he fell to political
newcomer Ronald Machtley.
   Three Republican incumbents were turned out of office, including
Pat Swindall in Georgia, who was defeated by Ben Jones. Swindall
faces perjury charges.
   Other GOP incumbents who fell included freshman Jack Davis in
Illinois and Mac Sweeney in Texas.
   Democrats picked up statehouse offices formerly held by
Republicans, including Indiana where 32-year-old Evan Bayh wrested
control from the Republicans for the first time in 20 years. Gaston
Caperton ousted GOP Gov. Arch Moore in West Virginia.
   Republicans countered with one takeaway of their own when Stan
Stephens won the Montana statehouse for the GOP for the first time
in 16 years.
   Two Republican incumbents survived close calls.
   Gov. Edward DiPrete overcame allegations of unethical conduct in
Rhode Island to defeat a Democratic businessman for the second time
in two years, while fellow Republican Norm Bangerter was re-elected
in Utah.
   Republican Rep. Judd Gregg stepped up to the New Hampshire
governor's office.

   The dollar fell sharply around the world
Wednesday despite central bank intervention as traders assessed what
impact George Bush's presidential victory would have on improving
the nation's twin deficits.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
bullion was bid at $422.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from
$418.25 late Tuesday.
   The dollar staged a strong but brief rally when trading began in
Tokyo based on Bush's win in Tuesday's election, but the currency
then headed lower and proceeded to plunge as activity shifted to
Europe and then the United States.
   In domestic dealings, the dollar finished off its lowest levels
but still managed to end at six-month lows against the Japanese yen
and at four-month lows against the West German mark and the British
pound.
   ``We've had pretty heavy selling most of the day,'' said Earl
Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago. ``There's a feeling that there are no quick solutions for
the (trade and budget) deficits and that Bush wouldn't have any
quick answers.''
   Traders said the dollar broke through key technical support
levels and then continued to move lower despite intervention by the
Federal Reserve to support the currency.
   The intervention ``was swallowed by the market and the dollar
kept going lower,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader at the Bank
of Boston's New York office.
   Dealers said the dollar's sell-off intensified after economist
Martin Feldstein called for a 10 percent to 20 percent decline in
the dollar over the next three years.
   Feldstein, the former head of President Reagan's Council of
Economic Advisors and now a professor at Harvard University, told a
conference of international investors sponsored by the American
Stock Exchange that the dollar must fall if the United States is to
reduce its trade imbalance and continue its economic recovery.
   Dealers said they expect the dollar to test lower ranges as
Bush's narrower-than-expected victory underlined what they saw as
voters' lack of enthusiasm for the president elect. In addition,
traders also focused on the difficulties Bush is likely to
experience in trying to plow legislation through a
Democrat-controlled Congress.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.08 Japanese yen to a closing 124.65
yen. Later, in London, it dropped to 124.20 yen. In New York the
dollar fell to 124.05 yen, from 125.70 yen on Tuesday. The dollar
has not closed so low in domestic dealings since last April.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7890, from $1.7707 late
Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.7930 to buy one pound, sharply more
expensive than Tuesday's $1.7705.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7635 West German marks, down from 1.7893;
1.4830 Swiss francs, down from 1.5026; 6.0180 French francs, down
from 6.1060; 1,312.65 Italian lire, down from 1,328.50, and 1.2312
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2341.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7665 West German marks, down from 1.7990;
1.4865 Swiss francs, down from 1.5005; 6.0460 French francs, down
from 6.1065; 1.9935 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0190; 1,319.50
Italian lire, down from 1,330.00; and 1.2325 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.2350.
   Gold prices moved higher as the dollar weakened. On the New York
Commodity Exchange, gold finished at $423.10 a troy ounce, up
sharply from $419.10 on Tuesday.
   In London, bullion rose to a late bid of $423.25 a troy ounce,
from $418.50 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to $420 an ounce
from $418.50 late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.20 an
ounce to close at $421.32.
   Silver bullion rose on New York's Comex to finish at $6.548 a
troy ounce, from Tuesday's $6.393. In London the metal was quoted at
a late bid of $6.44 a troy ounce, up from $6.41 late Tuesday.

   Perjury and obstruction of justice charges were
brought Wednesday against a one-time aide to a trader accused in the
Princeton-Newport Partners racketeering-securities case.
   A federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Lisa Jones, an
employee of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. since 1981, for allegedly
giving ``materially false testimony'' to a grand jury.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said that Ms. Jones, currently a
trading assistant, has requested a leave of absence from the firm
and has been given leave effective Wednesday.
   ``We have been informed that she is going to plead innocent, and
therefore it is unfair for us to prejudge this situation,'' Anreder
said in a statement. ``However, we think this is a sad development.''
   Ms. Jones, 29, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., worked from 1982 to 1986
as a trader's assistant to Bruce Lee Newberg, a former trader of
convertible securities at Drexel's office in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   Newberg was indicted on racketeering charges in August along with
five officials of Princeton-Newport, for an alleged tax scheme to
create $13 million in bogus tax losses.
   That indictment was the first time federal racketeering charges
were brought against officials of a securities firm. The partnership
itself was not charged.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a massive civil
action against Drexel, but no criminal charges have been brought
against the investment banking firm.
   According to federal prosecutors, Ms. Jones, who has worked in
Drexel's high-yield bond department since 1981, was indicted on five
counts of lying to the grand jury and three counts of obstructing
justice in each of her three appearances before the grand jury in
January.
   If convicted on all eight counts, said prosecutors, Ms. Jones
faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine
on each count.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile said Wednesday it will repurchase about 1.5
percent of its estimated $21.5 billion in foreign debt for an
average of 56 cents on the dollar.
   Banco Central de Chile, the South American nation's central bank,
said it planned to buy back debt with a face value of $299 million
for $168.4 million in cash.
   The bank said it was accepting all bids for 57.5 cents on the
dollar or less. Hernan Somerville, Chile's negotiator in talks with
its foreign creditors, said the average purchase price was 56.3
cents on the dollar.
   Under the repurchase plan, which was announced in September,
foreign banks submitted bids to sell back debt at a specified
percentage of face value.
   Wednesday's announcement was issued through Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., Chile's agent for the purchase.

   Stock prices fell in moderate trading Wednesday
as the market skipped a presidential victory celebration and moved
instead to a post-election hangover.
   A victory by George Bush failed to rally the market, which
dwelled instead on the economic problems facing the new
administration, specifically the trade and budget deficits.
   A falling dollar and weaker bond prices also pressured the stock
market along with a suggestion by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
that the new president consider eliminating interest payment
deductions for loans used in corporate buyouts.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed down 9.25 points
at 2,118.24 after an erratic session in which the blue-chip
indicator opened lower, rallied before midday, then plunged more
than 20 points at mid-afternoon.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 2-to-1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
949 issues down, 493 up and 511 unchanged.
   ``We woke up this morning and were a little bit troubled because
of all the uncertainty,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president
for First Albany Corp. ``If you look at the market without the
election, it looked like an ordinary day with all the predictable
things like the dollar.
   ``But with the election, there were more serious questions than
answers. What kind of president is George Bush going to be? He's not
going to be Reagan.''
   Analysts said investors were mostly worried about the twin
deficits, which if allowed to swell could pressure interest rates
higher and possibly precipitate a recession.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 153.14 million shares, up
from 141.66 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at
regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled
179.346 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market was off about $15 billion in
value.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks declined
0.92 to 153.92.
   Among actively traded stocks, RJR Nabisco gained ] to 88[, Sears
Roebuck was up \ at 42] and Texas Instruments advanced [ to 37].
Utility stocks were mostly lower. AT&T was down \ to 28], ITT lost \

   Standard & Poor's industrial index fell 2.14 to 314.61, and S&P's
500-stock composite index declined 1.82 to 273.33.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market was
down 1.10 to 377.74.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 0.72

<HEAD>Pork-Belly Futures Tumble As Supplies Grow At Record Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of frozen pork-belly futures plummeted Wednesday on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to a report indicating the
meat industry was cramming the raw, unsliced bacon meat into
freezers at a record pace.
   On other markets, livestock futures also fell; precious metals
and copper futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans were mixed;
energy futures advanced; and stock-index futures retreated.
   Speculators have bid prices of pork-belly futures so high
relative to the cash market that it has become more profitable for
the meat industry to store bellies for sale at some future date than
to sell them fresh, analysts said.
   One consequence of this situation was revealed on Tuesday when
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange issued a weekly report showing that
the amount of frozen pork bellies in exchange-approved warehouses
outside of Chicago increased last week by 8.5 million pounds.
   That increase, plus a 1.3-million-pound rise in Chicago warehouse
stocks and a probable 1-million-pound increase in warehouses that do
not report to the Chicago Merc, brought the total movement into
warehouses for last week to nearly 11 million pounds, estimated
Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The biggest increase in storage accumulation for any single
month occurred in December of 1970, when we stored 34.4 million
pounds nationally,'' Levitt said. ``We are storing at a rate that's
faster than that.''
   The report sparked a dramatic sell-off in the futures market
Wednesday. Frozen pork bellies futures settled 1.50 cents to 1.65
cents lower with the contract for delivery in February at 44.30
cents a pound.
   ``The spread between the cash and futures is still about 11
cents, even with today's futures break,'' Levitt said. ``All you
need to cover all your costs of storing bellies from now into
February, when they're deliverable, is eight to 10 cents. Anything
on top of that is gravy for the industry.''
   The vast build-up in supplies of pork bellies forced prices to
8-year lows in July and prices of both cash and futures remain
sharply below their averages of the past seven years.
   But the aggressive storing of bellies likely will continue until
futures prices fall far enough to remove the profit incentive for
stashing bellies in freezers, analysts said.
   Most livestock futures retreated in sympathy with the sharp drop
in pork-belly futures, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .80 cent lower to .05 cent higher with December
at 73.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .68 cent
lower with November at 81.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
to 1.38 cents lower with December at 40.62 cents a pound.
   Precious-metals futures surged as the dollar weakened
substantially against other currencies, encouraging buying from all
directions.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $3.40 to $4 higher
with December at $424.70 a troy ounce; silver was 15.5 cents to 16.4
cents higher with December at $6.58 a troy ounce. Platinum settled
$15.50 to $17.60 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange with
January at $590.60 a troy ounce.
   Copper posted strong gains on the Comex on news of further supply
tightness caused by the 3-week-old miners' strike in Peru.
   Copper settled 2 cents to 3.3 cents higher with December at
$1.456 a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago
Board of Trade in light, cautious trading ahead of the Agriculture
Department's crop production report.
   The USDA projected a corn harvest of 4.67 billion bushels, down
34 percent from last year, and a soybean harvest of 1.51 billion
bushels, 21 percent below last year's level.
   The new corn production estimate was higher than expected, so
analysts predicted lower corn futures prices on Thursday. The
soybean number fell within the range of analysts' expectations.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$4.25{ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to } cent higher with
December at $2.79\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to { cent higher
with December at $2.23 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to {
cent higher with November at $7.96{ a bushel.
   Concerns about tight gasoline supplies propelled energy prices
higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 9 cents
higher with December at $13.86 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to
.99 cent higher with December at 44.52 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to .86 cent higher with December at 47.26
cents a gallon.
   Stock-index futures fell modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 1 point lower at 274.05.

<HEAD>Californians Approve Auto Insurance Cuts, Insurer Files Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large insurance company filed a lawsuit
Wednesday and threatened to abandon the California market after
voters narrowly approved a measure sharply cutting the cost of auto
insurance.
   In New York, stocks of several companies handling large amounts
of insurance in California dropped in early trading with the news
that the Ralph Nader-backed initiative had passed. But they
recovered by the end of the day to end narrowly mixed.
   The approval of the initiative was a heavy blow to the insurance
industry, which spent at least $60 million backing its own measures
and battling the Nader initiative and another rate-cutting proposal
by consumers and trial lawyers. The measures by the industry and
attorneys were defeated.
   ``I think it's a significant victory for the voters in
California, that they were able to withstand the incredible barrage
of misleading advertising by the insurance industry,'' said Carmen
Gonzales, spokeswoman for Voter Revolt, which sponsored Proposition
103.
   Under the proposition, insurers must lower almost all insurance
rates, including auto, home, and business coverage, by an immediate
20 percent below November 1987 rates. It would require an additional
20 percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers.
   The measure also puts control over future rate increases in the
hands of an elected insurance commissioner, strictly limits use of
territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subjects the
industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws.
   Insurers had argued that Proposition 103 was unconstitutional on
the grounds it would force corporations to operate at a loss. Some
companies have said the rate cuts would force them out of business
in California.
   In filing a lawsuit seeking to block the cuts, Fireman's Fund
Chairman William McCormick said: ``We have no choice but to
immediately take action to protect our business and our rights. We
hope that this situation will be corrected so that we can maintain
our strong presence in the state of California.''
   Fireman's Fund also said it will advise its agents and auto
policyholders that it plans to withdraw from the California personal
car insurance market.
   Fireman's Fund, which has 78,000 personal auto policies and
138,000 homeowners policies in California, said Proposition 103
could drain more than $100 million from the company in its most
important market.
   Bill Zimmerman, campaign manager for Proposition 103, said
earlier that his organization hoped to avoid a lawsuit with the
industry.
   ``The first thing we'll do,'' he said, ``is appeal to the
insurance industry not to be sore losers.'' But, he added, ``We have
a team of lawyers ready to follow them to the courthouse doors.''
   Proposition 103 passed by 51.1 percent yes votes to 48.9 percent
against.
   The four other insurance-related measures that were defeated
included the industry's no-fault insurance proposal, Proposition
104, and the insurers' companion measure, Proposition 106, which
would have cut fees charged by trial lawyers representing people
suing insurers.
   ``The fact the insurance and trial lawyers' measures failed is an
indication that people are sick and tired of special interests
meddling with the initiative process,'' said Proposition 103 author
Harvey Rosenfield.
   Voters also rejected Proposition 100 by consumer groups and trial
lawyers, which would have granted good drivers a 20 percent rate
cut; and Proposition 101, sponsored by a state assemblyman and an
independent insurance company to cut insurance costs for bodily
injury coverage.

   The Navy, making good on a recent pledge by its
top admiral, has awarded an $89.5 million contract to the General
Electric Co. to build and test an electric-drive propulsion system
for future warships.
   The service said in a brieAdministration and the U.S. Department of
Defense, this morning we
were able to negotiate a long-term contract with certain aerospace
industry companies that will allow Avtex Fibers-Front Royal to
return to full production of its fiber products,'' Avtex Chairman
John N. Gregg said in a statement.
   Gregg announced Oct. 31 he was closing the 49-year-old mill,
citing foreign competition and stiff environmental regulations. The
announcement sent NASA, the Department of Defense and an array of
government contractors scrambling to figure out what the impact
would be on the space shuttle program and other projects that depend
on a carbonizable rayon fiber.
   NASA has said it has enough of the material on hand for another
10 shuttle flights.
   Aerospace industry officials met with Gregg last week in Salt
Lake City.
   Avtex still faces problems stemming from environmental and safety
violations.
   Two days after Avtex said it was closing, Virginia Attorney
General Mary Sue Terry sued the company for $20 million, alleging
1,968 water pollution problems over the last eight years.
   A spokesman for Terry said Wednesday Avtex still was facing the
lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   A state judge has stricken a $1 billion claim
for punitive damages sought by Home Shopping Network Inc. in its
$1.5 billion suit against GTE Florida Inc. and a subsidiary, GTE
announced Wednesday.
   ``We're gratified by the judge's decision,'' said James Carideo,
vice president and general counsel for GTE Florida.
   HSN had no immediate comment.
   GTE said that under state law, no claim for punitive damages in a
civil suit is permitted unless there is reasonable showing either by
evidence in the record or offered by the claimant to support it.
   Circuit Judge Howard P. Rives's ruling granting a motion to
strike punitive damages against GTE Florida and GTE Communications
Corp. comes a week after GTE filed a countersuit against HSN.
   GTE accused the video retailer and its principal shareholders of
business libel and slander.
   HSN originally filed suit in September 1987, blaming GTE Florida
for $500 million in lost profits because of telephone calls not
delivered to HSN operators.

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In Chubb Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chubb Corp. agreed Wednesday to a $48
million settlement covering farmers in 10 Midwestern states who sued
the company when their applications for 1988 drought insurance were
denied.
   The settlement must be approved by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin
in Cincinnati. Chubb said it would deposit $48.125 million with the
court early next eek as part of the agreement.
   A lawsuit potentially representing 8,000 farmers in 10 states was
filed in federal court in Cincinnati and was scheduled for trial
Jan. 3 before Rubin.
   The farmers alleged that Chubb, which is based in Warren, N.J.,
unfairly denied them insurance against crop damage caused by this
year's severe summer drought.
   Attorneys spent much of Tuesday negotiating the settlement, which
was announced Wednesday evening.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Stanley M. Chesley, a Cincinnati
lawyer representing the farmers. ``I think this is going to work.
The key is farmers are going to get 100 cents on a dollar throughout
all 10 states.''
   Chubb said the $48 million should be enough to cover anticipated
payments to farmers who didn't receive policies, as well as
expenses, attorneys' fees and other distributions determined by
Rubin.
   The farmers will receive amounts equal to the losses that would
have been paid if they had been policy holders, minus what premiums
would have cost and any goodwill payments already made to them,
Chubb said in a statement.
   Chubb said it decided to settle for a number of reasons. It noted
that last October, when the case was being prepared for trial, there
was evidence ``which substantially affected Chubb's ability to
pursue the defense of this litigation.''
   Chubb said that included testimony of witnesses indicating that
officials of Good Weather International, which served as an agent
for Chubb in selling the insurance, ``had acted contrary to Chubb's
specific instructions in several material respects. This newly
discovered evidence dictated that Chubb pursue a settlement rather
than protracted and costly litigation.''
   The lawsuit potentially represents 8,000 farmers in Ohio,
Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan,
Missouri, Iowa and Wisconsin.
   Chubb last week offered $43.7 million in coverage to some farmers
whose insurance applications it had rejected this year. Some states,
including Ohio, have been reviewing the manner in which Chubb _
through its Federal Insurance Co. subsidiary _ marketed the drought
insurance and denied some applications for it.
   Chesley had told Rubin that Chubb was trying to settle with some,
but not all, of the farmers represented in the class-action suit.
   Chubb began rejecting payments in the middle of the year when it
said brokers sold more coverage than planned. Chubb lawyers said the
company was prepared to sell about $40 million in coverage, but
brokers sold more than $300 million.
   Chubb spokeswoman Gail Devlin said last week that the company had
made $11 million in goodwill payments to drought insurance
applicants and planned no additional payments.
   The company said on Oct. 17 that its Federal Insurance subsidiary
issued 1,176 policies in seven Midwestern states in the 1988 drought
insurance program, with those policies extending a total of $43
million in coverage. Chubb said Federal Insurance suffered $20
million in losses on those policies and has paid virtually all of
the losses to the policyholders.

   Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday began offering rebates

   The automaker said in a statement that it was offering $400

1988 Tempos through Dec. 5.
   Rebates were increased from $500 to $800 on the entire 1988

Bronco II 4X4 light truck; and from $400 to $600 on the 1988 Bronco

   Ford also said the expiration date of a $3,000 cash rebate on the
Merkur XR4Ti was extended from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5.
   The automaker said it was offering additional allowances through
Jan. 5 on Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable models equipped with
3.8-liter six-cylinder engines sold only to California residents.
   Rebates on the 1989 Taurus and Sable and 1988 Sable now total
$800, with allowances on the 1988 Taurus totaling $600, the
statement said. Rebates on those models outside California are $500
and $300 respectively, Ford said.

   GTE Corp. said Wednesday that it will cut
nearly 7,000 jobs over the next four years as a result of a
restructuring of its telephone operations.
   An unspecified number of additional jobs will be lost over the
next five years in staff reductions unrelated to the company's
restructuring, said GTE Chairman James ``Rocky'' Johnson in a
statement.
   The cuts will come mostly from the middle management ranks,
although some hourly employees will be let go. GTE employs roughly
160,000 people worldwide. Some 85,000 people are employed in the
company's domestic telephone operations, of which 28,000 are middle
managers.
   The job reductions are expected to generate ``substantial annual
cost savings, which will be reflected over time in rate reductions
to GTE customers and in improved earnings for GTE shareholders,''
Johnson said.
   The company, which will lay off people only as a last resort,
said a fair portion of the cuts come from employees opting for early
retirement.
   ``We expect as many as 2,000 people may take advantage of this
(early retirement) option,'' said Kent B. Foster, group vice
president of GTE Telephone Operating Group. GTE already has begun
informing employees about early retirement benefits.
   In addition, Foster said the company has had ``a virtual hiring
freeze in place throughout most of this year, so a number of
already-vacant positions simply will go unfilled.''
   He said that some employees will be reassigned to positions in
other GTE businesses.
   ``Some layoffs are inevitable, however, and will be used only as
a last resort,'' Foster said. ``the majority of these will come from
our management ranks and will occur over time.''
   The company would not project the number that will be laid off.
   GTE announced plans to streamline its telephone operations in
March to continue improving service quality and to become faster,
more flexible and responsive to customer requirements.
   Geoff Johnson, telecommunications analyst with Argus Research in
New York, said the job cuts are needed.
   ``They definitely have too many people relative to other
telephone companies,'' he said. ``It's also part of a broader trend
in the industry ... everyone has been trying to cut costs and
reducing through attrition or early retirement.''
   Argus's Johnson projected that GTE's plan could save about $93
million a year for three years. That does not include severance
costs.
   ``This is obviously positive for the bottom line,'' Johnson said.
   GTE had combined revenues and sales totaling $15.4 billion in
1987. Its three core businesses _ telecommunications, lighting and
precision materials _ employ about 161,000 people in 44 states and
38 other countries.

<HEAD>New Guidelines Upcoming On Bank LBO Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are growing increasingly
concerned about the vulnerability of banks participating in
corporate takeovers through leveraged buyouts.
   A spokeswoman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
which regulates 4,450 nationally chartered banks, said Tuesday that
the agency's examiners will receive new guidelines within the next
several weeks requiring them to evaluate institutions' risk from
making loans in leveraged buyouts, or LBOs.
   ``We want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis of
exactly what the risks are,'' spokeswoman Lee Cross said.
   The issue has taken on greater significance recently as an
unprecedented wave of multibillion-dollar LBO proposals _ financed
partly by billions in bank loans _ swept over Wall Street.
   Two weeks ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
whose agency regulates bank holding companies, told the Senate
Banking Committee that he has warned banks making leveraged buyout
loans to consider borrowers' prospects ``in a range of economic and
financial circumstances.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which insures commercial bank deposits, has said the
proliferation of LBOs is increasing the risk to the financial system.
   In a leveraged buyout, such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s
$20.6 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc., an investment group borrows
heavily in order to purchase stock and take over the company.
   The debt is repaid either with the acquired company's cash flow
or with mopney raised by the sale of its assets.
   The popularity of such deals and the resulting mushrooming of
debt has raised concern about the ability of debt-burdened companies
to withstand an economic downturn.
   Critics say most of the deals have been assembled since 1982,
when the economy began expanding, and have not been tested by a
recession.
   If a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn, the value of
its stock falls. However, a highly leveraged company could be forced
into bankruptcy if a bad economy makes it unable to meet its debt
payments.
   According to Loan Pricing Corp., a New York company which
monitors large bank loans to corporations, banks have lent $70
billion to highly-leveraged transactions since mid-1987. LBO and
takeover lending comprised 59 percent of the banks big corporate
loans in the July-September quarter.
   Ms. Cross said the comptroller's office began revising its LBO
guidelines after surveying the practices of 11 large money center
banks and five regional institutions in late spring and early summer.
   ``We found that so far the banks that have been involved seem to
have taken a pretty reasonable approach. ...No bank was
perfect...but we did not see any really substantial problems,'' Ms.
Cross said.
   But, she said, ``Our concern now is going forward as competition
in this area heats up.'' She said banks with less experience in LBOs
are likely to enter the lucrative area.
   Also, so far most LBOs have been put together for large,
well-established companies in stable industries. In the future, more
LBOs may be undertaken of riskier companies.
   The new comptroller's guidelines will not impose limits on LBO
lending, but will direct examiners to determine if a bank's policies
include limits on LBO lending as a whole and limits for single
deals, Ms. Cross said.
   She said examiners also will be checking to see if banks are
establishing adequate reserves against expected losses and whether
they have systems in place to properly track the performance of the
loans.
   One problem in developing the guidelines is that banks have
widely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveraged
lending, she said.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is working on a definition
of highly leveraged debt, which will be ready in several months,
said spokesman Peter Bakstansky.

<HEAD>Ministry Predicts Smaller Trade Surplus For 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Trade and Industry Ministry is
projecting that South Korea's trade surplus will shrink by $2
billion to $2.5 billion to $5 billion next year due to a slowdown in
exports caused by a strengthening Korean won currency.
   Under the projection, officials said Korean exports next year
likely will rise 11.8 percent to 12.9 percent from this year and
imports are expected to soar 17.3 percent to $61 billion.
   The ministry predicted a trade surplus of $7 billion to $7.5
billion for this year.
   Korean exports in the first 10 months of this year increased 28
percent from a year ago to $48.1 billion and imports increased by
28.3 percent to $42.2 billion, according to the ministry.
   Under pressure from the United States, the won so far this year
has gone up 13.7 percent against the dollar and is generally
expected to strengthen further for a possible annual appreciation of
up to 18.3 percent.
   The dollar was valued at 697.60 won Tuesday in New York.
   Some Korean businessmen have said that at the present pace, the
won may rise to about 600 won to the dollar by the end of next year.
   A stronger won would make Korean goods more expensive abroad
reducing their export competitiveness. There has been some U.S.
government criticism that South Korean has been supporting its
exports by keeping the won's value too low against the dollar.

<HEAD>Grand Met Extends $5.23 Billion Offer for Pillsbury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC on Wednesday extended
until midnight Monday its $5.23 billion offer to buy Pillsbury Co.,
a move that one analyst said keeps the pressure on Pillsbury's board.
   Meanwhile, Grand Met said Pillsbury shareholders had tendered
nearly three-quarters of their shares to the British spirits,
restaurant and consumer products company.
   ``It is time for Pillsbury's management and board to act in
accordance with the wishes of their shareholders,'' said Ian A.
Martin, chief executive of U.S. operations for the British
conglomerate.
   Grand Met's $60-per-share cash offer to buy all outstanding
shares of Pillsbury common stock had been scheduled to expire
Tuesday night. But Grand Met said before trading opened Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange that it was extending the offer until
midnight Monday, Nov. 14.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pillsbury fell 25
cents a share to $58.50.
   Analysts had speculated that Grand Met would extend the offer
because it wants to demonstrate to Pillsbury a strong showing among
shareholders who have agreed to sell their shares.
   Grand Met had to say how many shares were offered for sale, or
``tendered,'' if it was to extend the buyout offer. With the offer
extended, however, shareholders can take back their shares until the
next Grand Met deadline.
   Grand Met said that as the Tuesday night deadline neared, 63.4
million shares of Pillsbury common stock representing about 74.3
percent of the outstanding shares had been tendered.
   ``I think the ball is back in Pillsbury's court,'' said Craig
Carver, securities analyst with Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis.
   ``I think (Grand Met) is continuing to apply pressure to
Pillsbury's board. Grand Met is obviously dealing from strength
here.''
   Carver said he expects the two companies will ``sit down and
negotiate at the table.''
   Pillsbury announced Monday that it plans to spin off Burger King
Corp. to shareholders and possibly to pay one-time cash and
securities dividends through Burger King as part of an overall plan
that the company says will reap greater longer-term value for
shareholders.
   Grand Met's Martin noted that his company's offer is conditioned
upon redemption of Pillsbury's poison pill defense plan.
   ``Because Pillsbury has not redeemed its poison pill, we have not
purchased the tendered Pillsbury shares, even though a large
majority of the outstanding shares has been tendered to us,'' Martin
said.
   On Monday, Justice William Duffy of the Delaware Chancery Court
denied Grand Met's motion to invalidate Pillsbury's poison pill
defense. He ruled that, as of Oct. 17, Pillsbury's directors had not
abdicated their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting Grand
Met's offer.
   After Pillsbury announced that it was spinning off Burger King,
Grand Met renewed its motion before the Delaware Chancery Court for
a preliminary injunction directing Pillsbury to redeem the poison
pill.
   On Wednesday, Duffy denied Grand Met's request for a rehearing,
but he said he could still consider scheduling another hearing on
the issue if Grand Met files new evidence in the future.
   Pillsbury also is protected by several other state anti-takeover
laws and liquor laws that bar a distiller from also owning
restaurants.
   Grand Met is challenging those defenses in various courts and
negotiating with state liquor authorities. Grand Met has said it
would sell the affected Pillsbury restaurants.

   George Bush's victory in the U.S. presidential
election led to profit-taking on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market
today and a slight decline in the dollar against the yen.
   Share prices rose sharply rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 124.65 yen, down 0.08 yen from Tuesday's
close of 124.73 yen. Opening higher at 125.52 yen, it dropped 1.53
yen after hitting the day's high of 125.98 yen. It ranged between
124.45 yen and 125.98 yen.
   ``This is what we call a `jet-coaster' phenomenon,'' said a
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, using a phrase which meant the dollar
rose sharply and then dropped quickly.
   Although the dollar opened higher and remained near the opening
level during the morning, it began to drop when dealers, who had
over-bought cheaper dollars in recent days expecting Bush's victory,
all began selling the currency when it was about to hit the 126-yen
mark to collect their profits, the dealer said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 140.91-point winner
Tuesday, gained another 205.51 points, or 0.73 percent, to end
trading at 28,212.78. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed at 28,007.27
points.
   The index began rising earlier when news of Bush's election lead
was reported, said a dealer with a major securities firm in Tokyo,
also speaking anonymously.
   For the most part it was business as usual, he said, but the
announcement of Bush's victory prompted some additional buying
because many market players expect the Republican president to
continue current U.S. economic policy.

<HEAD>Polaroid Chairman Testifies In Takeover Battle Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. Chairman I. MacAllister
Booth testified Wednesday that the company long had considered an
employee stock ownsership plan and did not slap one together to
block a takeover by Shamrock Holdings Inc.
   Booth, making his first appearance on the stand in the Delaware
Chancery Court trial of Shamrock's suit to block the plan, portrayed
Polaroid as a company that is concerned about its workers and was
surprised by Shamrock's takeover assault last summer.
   ``This was a jolt. Wow,'' Booth said of a June letter from
Shamrock President Stanley P. Gold indicating interest in Polaroid.
``Someone was saying you are vulnerable.
   ``After two to three years of rumors...someone was sending a
message and we needed to demonstrate that we are doing something to
improve the profitability of the company.''
   Shamrock, the Disney family-controlled concern based in Burbank,
Calif., is asking Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger to overturn the
10-million-share, $300 million stock plan that Polaroid uneveiled
July 12, just one day before a scheduled meeting with Shamrock.
   The plan would all but block a takeover because it puts 14
percent of Polaroid stock in the hands of employees. Under Delaware
takeover law, a hostile bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of
a target's outstanding shares for control. Polaroid, which is based
in Cambridge, Mass., is incorporated in Delaware.
   Shamrock on July 19 made a friendly $40-a-share bid for Polaroid.
It later made a hostile $42-a-share offer that Polaroid has urged
its stockholders to reject. The takeover hinges on the outcome of
the trial.
   Polaroid's board envisioned a 5 percent ESOP on March 29 before
increasing it to 14 percent at its July meeting. Booth, in more than
five hours of testimony, said the plan was undertaken to increase
worker motivation and that Polaroid had talked about an employee
stock plan as long as 15 years ago.
   ``This was the thing to do,'' Booth said. ``We were tying
together our employees and shareholders in a tight way. It seemed to
be a win-win situation.''
   Booth admitted that low profits, the possibility of a large
damage award in a patent infringement case against Eastman Kodak
Co., undervalued real estate assets and high research spending made
the company an attractive target.
   In fact, he said, Polaroid had the investment banking firm
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. develop a ``vulnerability profile'' of
the company last March, the same time Booth asked Polaroid's board
for permission to study an ESOP.
   Booth said he supported an ESOP as a way to ``align the company
with the board and the shareholders'' at a 1985 board meeting.
   ``There was a real separation between shareholders and the
employees,'' he said. ``The employees did not relate to the
shareholders. I tried to explain that bonding between employees and
owners was vital.''
   Under questioning from Polaroid attorney Frederick A.O. Schwartz,
Booth denied that Polaroid deceived Shamrock by abruptly canceling
the scheduled July 13 meeting. He said he couldn't meet with
Shamrock because ``I needed that time to talk to employees.''
   Booth also denied the ESOP was designed to entrench management,
saying that he is forfeiting $200,000 to $300,000 in bonus
compensation next year because of a stipulation in the plan.
   Booth is not scheduled for cross-examination until next Monday.

<HEAD>Utility Officials Meet Over WPPSS Settlement</HEAD>

   A Washington utility said late Wednesday it
would not join 14 other utilities in a $226 million settlement that
would remove it from the Washington Public Power Supply System
securities fraud trial.
   However, commissioners for the Snohomish County Public Utility
District said they were not ruling out any chance of reaching a
settlement agreement.
   The commissioners disclosed the decision, which came less than 24
hours before the deadline for joining the settlement, after an
evening meeting with a court-appointed settlement master.
   The three commissioners took no action after their meeting with
Settlement Master Junius Hoffman and ``no further talks were
scheduled,'' Commission President Matt Dillon said in a statement.
   ``We have a great deal of confidence in the judicial system and
the jury's good judgment and common sense,'' he said.
   The trial stems from lawsuits brought after WPPSS defaulted in
1983 on $2.25 billion in municipal bonds used to finance
construction of two nuclear power plants that never were completed.
   Dillon did not reveal details of the meeting, but called the
discussion ``a frank exchange of views.''
   Hoffman summoned the commissioners by a special court order in an
attempt to persuade them to accept the proposed settlement.
   Snohomish had until 5 p.m. local time Thursday to decide whether
to join 14 former utility defendants which agreed on Oct. 31 to the
settlement with buyers of WPPSS municipal bonds.
   The settlement called for Snohomish to pay $48.6 million for its
13-percent share of the project. That amount would have been in
addition to the $226 million, which includes contributions of $35
million from the federal Bonneville Power Administration and $10
million from Washington state.
   Under the settlement provisions, the plaintiffs now cannot settle
out of court with Snohomish for less than $58 million.
   Chuck Shigley, the utility's commissioner administrator, said the
failure to reach a settlement now ``does not close the door. The
commission has always said it is interested in a fair settlement.''
   Snohomish is the sole utility remaining in the case stemming from
the 1983 default, the largest muncipal bond default in U.S. history.
   Bonneville, the federal power broker for the Pacific Northwest,
had insisted on the deadline for Snohomish, plaintiffs attorney Mel
Weiss has said.
   Snohomish, engineering firms Ebasco Services Inc. and United
Engineers and Contractors Inc., and financial adviser Blyth Eastman
Paine Webber Inc. are the only defendants remaining in the trial.
   Chemical Bank of New York, a trustee for bondholders, and a class
of more than 24,000 bondbuyers accuse the defendants of conspiring
to lie and hide information that might have discouraged potential
bond investors.The plants, a joint project of WPPSS and 88
utilities, were scrapped unfinished in 1982.

   At least 47 insurance companies refused
Wednesday to write auto insurance policies in California under the
20-percent rate rollback provisions of a state proposition question.
   The ballot question aimed at skyrocketing insurance rates
narrowly passed in Tuesday's election and was immediately challenged
Wednesday in state Supreme Court by insurers.
   Don Stewart, executive director of the American Agents Alliance
insurance organization, said at least 47 companies stopped writing
policies, except those assigned-risk plans mandated by California
law.
   ``It's chaos for the companies,'' Stewart said. ``We foresaw
(Proposition) 103 being a disaster, but we simply didn't get the
message over to the public.''
   Stewart said companies that have stopped issuing new polices
include Transamerica Insurance Group, The Travelers Cos., Allstate,
Hartford Insurance Group, 20th Century and Safeco Insurance Co. of
America.
   In a related move, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled
Wednesday that two Los Angeles surety bond companies be temporarily
exempted from reducing rates as required, opening the door for other
challenges.
   In New York, stocks of several companies handling large amounts
of insurance in California dropped in early trading with the news
that the Ralph Nader-backed initiative had passed.
   The approval of the initiative was a heavy blow to the insurance
industry, which spent at least $60 million backing its own measures
and battling the Nader initiative and another rate-cutting proposal
by consumers and trial lawyers. The measures by the industry and
attorneys were defeated.
   ``I think it's a significant victory for the voters in
California, that they were able to withstand the incredible barrage
of misleading advertising by the insurance industry,'' said Carmen
Gonzales, spokeswoman for Voter Revolt, which sponsored Proposition
103.
   Under the proposition, insurers must lower almost all insurance
rates, including auto, home, and business coverage, by an immediate
20 percent below November 1987 rates. It would require an additional
20 percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers.
   The measure also puts control over future rate increases in the
hands of an elected insurance commissioner, strictly limits use of
territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subjects the
industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws.
   Insurers had argued that Proposition 103 was unconstitutional on
the grounds it would force corporations to operate at a loss. Some
companies have said the rate cuts would force them out of business
in California.
   In filing a lawsuit seeking to block the cuts, Fireman's Fund
Chairman William McCormick said: ``We have no choice but to
immediately take action to protect our business and our rights. We
hope that this situation will be corrected so that we can maintain
our strong presence in the state of California.''
   Fireman's Fund also said it will advise its agents and auto
policyholders that it plans to withdraw from the California personal
car insurance market.
   Fireman's Fund, which has 78,000 personal auto policies and
138,000 homeowners policies in California, said Proposition 103
could drain more than $100 million from the company in its most
important market.
   Bill Zimmerman, campaign manager for Proposition 103, said
earlier that his organization hoped to avoid a lawsuit with the
industry.
   ``The first thing we'll do,'' he said, ``is appeal to the
insurance industry not to be sore losers.'' But, he added, ``We have
a team of lawyers ready to follow them to the courthouse doors.''
   Proposition 103 passed by 51.1 percent yes votes to 48.9 percent
against.
   The four other insurance-related measures that were defeated
included the industry's no-fault insurance proposal, Proposition
104, and the insurers' companion measure, Proposition 106, which
would have cut fees charged by trial lawyers representing people
suing insurers.
   ``The fact the insurance and trial lawyers' measures failed is an
indication that people are sick and tired of special interests
meddling with the initiative process,'' said Proposition 103 author
Harvey Rosenfield.
   Voters also rejected Proposition 100 by consumer groups and trial
lawyers, which would have granted good drivers a 20 percent rate
cut; and Proposition 101, sponsored by a state assemblyman and an
independent insurance company to cut insurance costs for bodily
injury coverage.
